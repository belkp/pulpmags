the escape

by henry c rowland

author of the arbiterslithe rubber a fan   etc

       escape in more senses than one from unconscious drug addiction on
    the part of the heroine from conscious drink addiction on the part of the
    hero from the world of everyday for the both of them to that region where
    all is hope and faith and beauty incidentally doctor rowland the author
    gives us a memorable and authoritative picture of the inside workings of one
    of the best modern sanitariums for the cure of those who have fallen under
    the spell of drugs and alcohol the story is a plain unvarnished tale but
    it is one that none should miss

a complete novel

chapter i

the girl

the case is unfortunately a fairly
frequent one said the dis-
tinguished specialist your
daughter is an unconscious vic-
tim of the opium habit this drug
has probably been administered peri-
odically and without her knowledge
during a term of several years

  mr castellane a millionaire manu-
facturer of whisky received this in-
formation with a gesture of protest

  but how can that be possible he
demanded she has always been di-
rectly under the eye of miss more-
house

  precisely answered the physician
and miss morehouse is herself a drug
habituee have you never noticed her
peculiar complexion and the pupils of
her eyes

  castellane nodded now that you
speak of it he assented
ibp

  it is probable contined the spe-
cialist that the governess first began
her criminal practice when she found
her charge becoming a little difficult to
restrain from the activities and amuse-
ments naturally desired by a girl of
such splendid vitality being lazy and
disinclined to exert herself in helping
to gratify these cravings she proceeded
to dull them with the drug she has
now i become alarmed at the amount
required and is trying to lessen it
hencethese tantrums

  castellane looked very much dis-
turbed the love which he really felt
for his motherless daughter had shown
itself always in material ways rather
than personal interest

  well said he we dont want any
scandal ill get rid of the woman
and you do what you can to correct
the damage

  that may be a matter of months
said the doctor so far as your
daughter is concerned it is going to


the popular magazine

take in my professional opinion at
least a year to free her system of its
craving for the drug i should there-
fore recommend that she be committed
for this length of time to a sanitarium
which makes a specialty of such cases
she need never know the real facts of
her treatment in fact it is highly
necessary that she should not we will
tell her that the condition of her nerv-
ous system absolutely demands a rest
cure i find her to be a sensible young
woman and of a naturally strong and
robust constitution she ought to be
a perfect diana what with her splen-
did physique and a mind which is alert
and intelligent despite a lifelong course
of more or less periodic poisoning it
is probable that at the end of three
months in such an institution as i have
in mind she will begin to feel the first
real joie de vivre which she has ever
experienced poor girl but in order to
make sure i advise that she be com-
mitted for an entire year

  and so it happened that helen cas-
tellane through no fault of hers found
herself an inmate of doctor moritz
brinkers excellent institution on the
shore of long island sound she had
made no objection at being there in-
stalled doctor bright had first taken
her with her father in his car to visit
the place and helen had roused suffi-
ciently from her recent apathetic state
to display a pleased interest in the
charming grounds which were not in-
closed and held nothing of the prison
or asylum atmosphere the golf links
tennis courts bowling alleys bathing
beach and stables suggested rather the
country place of some multimillionaire
than a sanitarium and the bungalows
occupied by patients and attendants
were delightfully homelike many of
the inmates were strolling about
dressed as though for an afternoon at
a country club and taking tea in the
little kiosks chatting happily

  one failed to notice that the windows
were all furnished with artistic iron
grilles and that a patient or group of
patients was never without vigilant
attendant or attendants the latter so
closely resembling the patients in cloth-

ing and deportment as to be indistin-
guishable from their charges neither
in passing the mens department of the
big establishment which was perhaps a
quarter of a mile distant would one
ever have suspected the idle gentlemen
loitering here and there in its environs
smoking and reading of being in the
nature of pickets carefully selected for
their powers of persuasion moral first
and shot with infinite tact and patience
and failing that sufficient muscular
force to make actual restraint uninjuri-
ous to the refractory inmate they
passed a number of men coming from
the tennis courts to their bath and they
looked so rugged and healthy and
cheerful that helen could not believe
that they were patients when so as-
sured by doctor bright he did not
see fit to mention that the bulk of them
would shortly be under lock and key
for the night after their simple supper
and game of pool or billiards

  it all looked very nice to helen
though her interest was blurred by the
disagreeable sensation of unrest which
had possessed her since a few days be-
fore miss morehouse had been sud-
denly called away to see a dying friend
or relative or something and one of
the maids served her needs helen
could not always remember the maids
name nor what she looked like she
was not conscious of any particular
affection for miss morehouse but felt
that she needed her in some vague way
then learning that miss morehouse
might not return for several weeks she
had indifferently consented to go to the
sanitarium

  but now as she sat looking about
her with listless eyes she found herself
growing rapidly more and more tor-
mented with some imperative though
indescribable craving she was neither
hungry nor thirsty nor sleepy nor ener-
getic nor did she feel particularly nerv-
ous she wras merely conscious in a
vague way of some violent unfilled
want though what it was that she
wanted she could not possibly have
said yet it threatened to grow intol-
erable and she felt that if anybody
were to come up and speak to her she
the escape



would scream the sight erf the people
moving about was repugnant to her es-
pecially the sight of the men in their
flannels and shirts doctor bright
glanced keenly at her strained face and
tortured eyes and told the chauffeur
to drive up to the administration build-
ms-

  you arc a little tired miss castel-
lane said lie gently i am going to
get you a demi-tasse of coffee after
that we will start back

  i dont want any coffee thanks
helen answered and id rather not
stop if you dont mind i would rather
keep on going now that weve seen the
place lets go fast

  in a minute he answered and
stepped out and entered the building to
return a moment later with the bever-
age suggested

  drink this he said pleasantly
doctors orders you know

  oh well if i must- she an-
swered sulkily and drained the cup
she handed it to him with an expres-
sion of faint pleasure

  thank you doctor thats the first
decent cup of coffee ive had since miss
morehouse went away it tastes like
what she used to make me perhaps
i did need it after all

  i think so he answered quietly
and told the chauffeur to return to the
castellane place some twenty miles
away

chapter ii

the boy

  his twin sisters lawrn party was at
its height when jack oconnor arrived
modestly at his fathers palatial sum-
mer estate on the hudson the fete
was in honor of jeannes recent gradu-
ation from vassar and was a very
elaborate affair her father judge
oconnor a jurist of great renown and
at that moment very prominent politi-
cally had promised to run out on an
early train to assist

  jack also had promised to assist and
was now faithfully observing that
promise though with considerable dif-
ficulty and great sacrifice to his own
personal affairs as they entered the

imposing gates of the estate he swayed
forward in his seat and said to the
driver of the station taxi

  gesh you besser let me out at the
back door bill don wanner run into
the judge til i freshen up a bit he
might think id been drinkin again
he sure might sir the driver an-
swered and took the trail of the de-
livery vehicles

  says-ic-f i got drunk again hed
-ic-gimme ninety days mumbled
jack confidentially but ill be all
ri all i need is a-ic-bath and
about forty winks

  if i was you id take about forty
thousand sir said the driver ill
get ahold o james the butler and hell
fix you up

  he stopped the car at the back door
quite unnoticed as everybody was fly-
ing about full of the business of the
party then in full swing from the
lawns and groves at the front of the
house overlooking the majestic river
came a babel of voices and the ripple
of girlish laughter it was the first of
july and the day though fair was
muggy and intensely hot and thunder-
heads were beginning to form behind
the jersey hills

  just wait a minute and ill get james
to lend a hand said the sympathetic
driver and slipped out of his seat

  oh thash a right- said jack

and leaning against the door unlocked
it he came out headfirst and be-
fore the driver cotild catch him landed
on the gravel slightly scratching his
forehead then with the drivers assist-
ance struggled to his feet

 damn-caught my -ic-eel-

he mumbled here you are bill-

b-b-blow yourself ob boy- and

he shoved a five-dollar bill into the
drivers hand

  a footman had observed the accident
from the pantry window and he now
came hurrying out and offered his arm

  very good said he to the driver
ill look arfter im e must a ad
a eat stroke and he grinned

  thash it jack replied a bloom-
in bally-ic-eat stroke can you
wonder me lad jush gimme a and


the popular magazine

to me room if youll be so-ic-werry
kind im a bit blurred in the ead

  the footman steered him into the
house and passed some giggling maids
then up the back stairs to his room
where he flung himself onto the bed
had the man been less busy or pos-
sessed of a little sense one glance at
the boys purple and congested face
would have started him for the tele-
phone to send in a hurry call for the
doctor but his own responsibilities
pressing he merely unfastened his col-
lar and then seeing that he had appar-
ently fallen asleep hurried back to the
pantry intending to report the matter
to james as soon as he happened to
run across him in the meantime it
seemed to him that the crown prince
of the oconnor dynasty was quite out
of mischief and harms way and would
so remain for some hours so with a
silly chuckle he hastened back to his
duties

  for about an hour jack lay comatose
his black curly head pillowed on one
shirt-sleeved arm then suddenly he
awoke sat up and looked about him
wildly the congestion had faded and
he was rather pale through the
screened window came the refreshing
sound of splashing water from the big
fountain on the terrace mingled with
the laughter of young men and maidens

  all hands in swimmin he mut-
ered that for mine 

  whether it had entered his distorted
mentality that a bathing party was in
progress or merely because to his
fevered brain and bod- the desire to re-
fresh himself in the cool water of the
fountain became an imperative impulse
must be left to the alienist to decide
at any rate he rose with a fair amount
of stability ripped off his clothes and
then in his hot impatience apparently
forgetting the necessity of a bathing
suit he went to the closet slipped into
an embroidered silk kimono and
stepped out into the hall

  the house was deserted except for
the commissary department and no-
body observed him as he went down
the broad main stairway passed
through the hall and reception room

and onto the terrace that also was
deserted owing to the heat but the
fountain was splashing most refresh-
ingly fifty or sixty yards beyond
and on two of its sides were clusters
of ornamental trees and in the shade
of these many brightly clad figures were
standing or sitting or moving about
and as jack in his flowered kimono de-
scended the broad stone steps with a
determined tread these paused in their
conversation and looked curiously in
his direction no doubt they thought
it some sort of joke or prank for their
amusement

 but when he stepped upon the
rounded coping and the kimono slipped
from his shoulders and fell to the
sward there was a sudden shriek of
dismay the next instant there was
the flash of a white body a splash
and a general stampede on the part of
the guests the ladies away from and
the men toward the fountain and
foremost among these latter was the
lean wiry figure of judge oconnor
who had been the first to recognize his
only son and heir

  and none too soon did they arrive
for jack had dived too straight strik-
ing his forehead on the cemented bot-
tom and his father standing waist-
deep in the water handed him up to
the others who bore him stunned and
senseless to the house

  jacks next clear consciousness was
that of awakening to find himself lying
upon a bed in a cool spacious room
simply furnished and with white-enam-
eled walls and ceiling sitting by the
window reading a newspaper was a
squarely built neatly dressed young
man with a pleasant irish face

  hello said jack raising himself
unsteadily on his elbow where the
deuce am i at 

  the young man laid down his news-
paper and rose with a smile

  so yare awake sor said he and
how are ye feelin 

  rotten thanks jack answered
what place is this anyhow

   tis doctor brinkers sanitarium
sor ye was brought here last evenin
the bscacpe



sufferin from sunshtroke and a crack
in the head

  oh i see said jack and fell back
on his pillow doctor brinkers booz-
orium eh well i guess im in the
right place

  true for you sor tis a foine place
entirely all the gintlemen like it
maybe i might get you a drink

  id give a months allowance for
a drink of whisky said jack but i
suppose theres no chance of that
av coorse there is sor tis that i

mane wan minute sor-

  he went out to return an instant
later with a tumbler containing a lib-
eral drink of whisky a siphon and a
bowl of cracked ice mixing the bev-
erage he offered it to jack

  lap that up sor said he  twill
give ye strenth i am your attendant
sor and me name is mike

  jacks hand shook so that he threat-
ened to spill the precious contents of
the glass mike took it gently from
him

  lave me sor said he theres
dom few can manage it when they first
come in he held the glass to jacks
eager lips aisy sor-aisy does it
jack sank back with a sigh which
was partly shudder well said he
i must say mike that for a boozorium
theyre tender-hearted here a drink
was the very last thing id expected
mike smiled sure a drink is aisier
on the patient than a strait-jacket said
he cheerfully you will be gettin a
slug like that every three hours for
the nixt few days then when vare
feelin better they will taper ye down
like tis dangerous to stop too sud-
den i will go now and tell doctor
lawley yare feelin hetther

  he went out and jack lay reflect-
ing on his situation he had a foggy
recollection of his arrival at home and
being helped to his room but there-
after all was blank the judge prob-
ably learned that i wtas there drunk
when i ought to have been helping jill
entertain he said to himself so he
loaded me into the car and spun me
over here to do my ninety days as he
threatened to the last time i got on the

loose well no doubt its the best thing
that could have happened me by that
time the damned stuff will all be
sweated out of my system and i can
stick to beer or go on the cart alto-
gether no more hard stuff for mine
this seems to be a decent sort of place
and all its tank alumni that ive met
seem to have enjoyed their alma
mater some even take postgraduate
courses here

  wherefore doctor lawley who -en-
tered presently found his patient in as
cheerful a frame of mind as badly
jangled nerves and a sorely inflamed
stomach would permit jack conceived
an immediate liking for and confi-
dence in this big fine-looking young
doctor with his strong kindly face and
keen gray eyes

  you turned a close corner my boy
said doctor lawley i was really
worried about you last night if it
hadnt been for the blood let out of
yoij from that crack on the head you
miglit have slipped your cable but
youre safe in port now he went
over jacks heart with his stethoscope
then took his blood pressure all
right he said sound as a dollar
but too thin youve been getting too
much booze and not enough food and
exercise well fix that here you
ought to weigh one hundred and sixty
stripped and i dont believe you could
tip the beam at one hundred and forty
well if you want anything just tell
mike and if you find it too long be-
tween drinks well shove the clock
ahead a little so long

  and the strong support of the weak
and willful continued on his rounds

chapter iii

tiie girl awakes

 she ban vary pretty when she
come observed madam larsen the
chief masseuse to nurse cassel but
now she is vonderful and so much
strength yust look at her arms and
legs she remind me ohf our yoong
swedish gerls with her eyes so bright
and blue and her golden hair and
strrong slender body and her color
is so goot


the popular magazine

  the pair were watching helen cas-
tellane who was being given swimming
instruction by an athletic young eng-
lishwoman on the sheltered bathing
beach it was late in august and the
girl had been nearly six months an
inmate of the institution having entered
early in march splashing about in the
warm water with the sun flashing on
her bright hair and from her creamy
limbs slightly tanned from these ex-
ercises helen was indeed a delight to
the eye of the beauty lover or eugenic
apostle although just eighteen her
splendid figure had still about it a sug-
gestion of boyishness its feminine
curves as yet unaccentuated a sculp-
tor would have loved to depict her as
one of artemis youthful nymphs -

  has she still those nairvous spells 
asked madam larsen

  no miss cassel answered though
sometimes she is very restless and
wakeful that creature must have
given her quantities of the filthy stuff
such a woman ought to be flogged and
sentenced to ten years hard labor in a
coal pit

  it vould sairve her ride agreed the
masseuse

  helen is so strong said miss cas-
sel that there is no doubt of her mak-
ing a complete recovery but it is going
to take some time still the trouble
now is that she is beginning to get res-
tive and wants to know why she is
being kept here when she feels per-
fectly well im afraid that in another
month she is going to be hard to hold
she is like a person who has been un-
der a great physical strain just awak-
ening from a long refreshing sleep
she has been only about half awake
the most of her life poor dear and
has no more idea of people and things
and life in general than a child of ten
but now she is beginning to take an
interest in the wrorld around her and
reads and asks odd questions and very
often i find her apparently deep in
thought she reminds me of a little
bird that commences to find the nest
too cramped and wants to try its
wings

  ven she leafs here she should
marry said madam larsen senten-
tiously that vould complete her
cure the masseuse had distinctly
european ideas in regard to certain
vital principles

  i dont agree with you replied
m iss cassel rather sharply she is
far too young besides she has abso-
lutely no experience of life and has
never had the least bit of fun or gay-
ety as other girls have

  once she ban married she vould
get it altogether observed the mas-
seuse i ban married at seventeen
and it dont take long-

  her bath finished helen was given
her rub and bouillon and sun bath
then came luncheon to which she now
looked forward with eager appetite and
after that an hour or two in the shade
of the tall veranda reading or chatting
with her fellow patients none of whom
had the slightest inkling of the actual
facts of her case but considered it
merely as the nervous breakdown of a
growing girl she wras now permitted
to play tennis a game which she had
never learned she had never cared to
learn she had never greatly cared for
anything or anybody and her days had
been spent principally in apathetic idle-
ness with few social diversions and
little exercise

  but the strength inherited from a
race of sturdy ancestors had supported
the conditions of this unwholesome life
and aside from the toxic influence of
the drug which was not constant but
only at certain nervous periods her
atmosphere had been sufficiently whole-
some she had grown up as it were
in a latent condition with faculties less
injured than restrained now that the
subduing poison had been gradually re-
moved these long-restrained potential-
ities were beginning to move and stir
and burgeon with a velocity which was
inversely proportional to the long term
of their imprisonment physically and
mentally she was wdthout a blemish
  

the sap was beginning to mount and
like a young birch which has been held
inanimate throughout the long winter
frost she could feel the life beginning
the escape



to stir and quicken in heart and branch
and twig

  it amazed her to discover that the
world was vastly and vitally interesting
even as viewed from the confines of a
sanitarium and so rapidly did her
interest in it increase that each day
brought a keener desire to get out of
her narrow limits and look about with
bright awakened eyes

  previously she had never cared for
reading and she had never cared for
the society of men but now she found
herself possessed of a curious craving
for both there was a full list of mag-
azines on the library table and she de-
voured their contents with the eager-
ness of a vigorous intelligence hitherto
deprived of such a recreation through
blindness or lack of the ability to read
stories of adventure and romance
stirred depths formerly untroubled
they colored her dreams and in her
waking hours plunged her into reveries
which were rather exciting than pas-
sive and without the slightest tinge of
melancholy she found herself grow-
ing daily more impatient with the tic-
tac-tic-tac smooth clockwork machi-
nery of the institution and eager to
break bounds  a voyage of discovery
but this augmenting impulse did not
affect her nerves unfavorably she
was happy enough in her growing
health and strength kindly and care-
fully tended and she liked the people
about her but nevertheless she did not
wish to remain longer

  her father came out to see her every
sunday and on his last visit helen
stated her case

  papa im quite well now and i
want to leave she said positively she
had always felt rather shy of her father
but this diffidence seemed to have de-
parted

  oh i think youd better stay on a
couple of months longer helen he
answered you are doing so mighty
well that it seems a pity to run the risk
of spoiling it all

  theres no danger of that said
helen in a positive tone that made her
father raise his eyebrows i was never
really ill to begfn with and if i were

to stay here another six months i
couldnt possibly feel any better than
i do now i want to get out and do
something i want to manage our house
and meet people and do things this
place is very nice and the people are
most kind and im very fond of them
but ive been cooped up here long
enough i want to leave and there is
absolutely no reason why i shouldnt
but the doctor says--

  i dont care what the doctor says
helen interrupted hotly i know how
i feel better than the doctor ive been
babied jong enough ive been babied
all my life i dont want to say any-
thing against miss morehouse but
somehow i feel that if she hadnt been
forever cuddling and coaxing me and
telling me i looked tired and must rest
and all that sort of thing id never
had to come here at all however
thats passed im all right now and
i want togo home if i break down
or anything you can pack me out here
again

  castellane looked disturbed and a
trifle embarrassed here was presented
a phase of his daughter such as he had
never made acquaintance with it was
evident enough to him that helen was
fairly brimming with health and vital-
ity but doctor bright had advised a
years treatment and of this but little
over four months had passed so he
temporized s

  well my dear said he ill speak
to doctor bright about it and see what
he says its a little awkward just at
this moment as the chances are that i
may have to run out to the pacific slope
next week possibly to be gon two or
three months

  i can go to aunt helens

  shes off on a cruise with the mait-
lands however wtell see mean-
while just be patient and keep on as
youre going and well soon have you
out he glanced at his watch and
with a rather hurried farewell went out
and jumped into his car

  three days later helen received the
following note

  dear dauchteh i have talked with doc-
tor bright and explained to him your wish


the popular magazine

to leave the sanitarium and your assurance
of feeling entirely well which fact i was
able to demonstrate myself so far as it is
possible to do so with ones own eyes he
was very glad to hear of your great improve-
ment but would not listen to the idea of
your leaving for at least another three
months he tells me that the nature of the
nervous disorder from which you suffered
is such as takes some years to develop and
for the radical cure of which at least nine
months of treatment arc positively required

  bosh  muttered helen angrily

  i am very sorry my dear but i am afraid
that we shall have to abide by the doctors
decision you must remember that you
have never been in thoroughly good health
since childhood and compare your present
condition with that of past years you are
still very young and a few months patience
now will fully repay you for the blessing of
future well-being health after all is every-
thing once you make up your mind to see
the cure through i am sure that you will
find yourself as happy and contented for the
next few months as you have been since
your entrance to the sanitarium

  unfortunately the pressure of business be-
fore i leave will make it impossible for me
to get out to see you before starting west
but perhaps it is just as well as i fear i
might be persuaded to listen to your en-
treaties and act contrary to doctor brights
positive advice try to be patient and cheer-
ful and remember that there are some good
times in store once you come out into the
world again a strong and healthy girl with
much love	father

  helen flung- the letter aside and
resting her elbows on the table dropped
her face in her hands and burst into
tears three months more three
months of gilded prison when she was
fairly brimming with eagerness to get
out into the great world of which she
knew so little and yearned to know so
much three months more of smooth
smiling nurses and attendants and gar-
rulous old cats with real or imaginary
ills usually the latter

  but she was a brave girl and the
paroxysm of despair quickly was un-
der control what most helped her in
her disappointment was the note of ten-
der affection in her fathers letter she
had never realized that he really cared
for her or that his invariable kindness
to her was more than perfunctory and
the knowledge suffused her with a glow
of warmth about the heart so she
dried her eyes and set her firm little

chin and picking up her pen wrote him
an affectionate and obedient letter
promising to do her best to be cheerful
and happy and to gain all the health and
strength she could hinting rather shyly
that perhaps once this was accom-
plished they might yet have some good
times together this she posted and
then went into the library which was
deserted

  there were some voluminous sunday
newspapers scattered on the table and
to distract her mind from her disap-
pointment helen picked up a part of
one of them and seating herself in one
of the big wicker chairs started to
glance through it she wras scarcely
thinking of the text and almost startled
when a name directly in the focus of
her vision struck her retina as it
seemed with physical force that
name was bright

  then dazed and scarcely compre-
hending she read as follows

  lafayette due to-morrow many distin-
guished passengers among other well-
known americans doctor willard bright

  helen laid down the newspaper and
sat for a moment staring out across the
lawn at a group of harmless neuras-
thenics who were drinking tea in the
shade of a copper beech

  so papa lied to me said she softly
to herself

chapter iv

the boy awakes

  the faithful mike listened to what
doctor lawley had to say and his
good-natured irish face was puckered
and troubled

  if you was to ask me docthor
said he  tis not a square deal to my
way o thinkin and i am surprised
that a mon like judge oconnor should
be afther puttin the like across on his

scratching his thick scrub and crinkling
his forehead when the bye kem in
i says to mesilf  tis the best thing

i am not so sure tis not like he

he is too young and has not been at

riunce he has been takin stock o

  doctor lawley nodded hes been

in the pink of condition but pretty

  well said doctor lawley im go-
ing to tell him this afternoon and the

judge can go to the devil ive got
troubles of my own and im hanged if
im going to have this business hanging
over me for another month hes been
committed here in all due legal form
and were responsible for him until we
get our writ of habeas corpus served
on us if he tries to do a get-away
its up to us to put him under restraint
but in my opinion its a damned shame
and im not going to be any party to
keeping him in the dark about how he
stands it aint as if he was a chronic
souse or balmy and irresponsible

   tis amazin his father has not
more sinse mike observed and him
a judge

  doctor lawley shrugged ocon-
nors a hard man said he and hes a
proud man hes made his own way
and his own social position and now he
feels that jacks disgraced him and
his sister and he intends to have the
lesson well rubbed in that story in
the sunday papers with the cartoon of
jack diving into the fountain and the
women beating it in all directions must
have nearly killed him of course there
was a lot of political animus in that
stuff but the write-up alone was enough
to drive a man like the judge darn near
crazy well well hope for the best
and prepare for th worst and the
doctor proceeded on his rounds

  meanwhile the object of these fore-
bodings was cheerfully engaged in a
lively mill with the athletic trainer a
square-jawed square-shouldered young
man known as danny the last round
had been a warm one and danny
though a retired middleweight of some
considerable local renown had been
compelled to exert himself rather more
than was agreeable to maintain his pres-
tige a vicious left hook in the jaw had
all but sent him to the mat and realiz-
ing that it was no part of his duties
to knock out a rummy-as the alco-
holic patients were referred to by the
attendants-he stepped back and pulled
off his gloves

  geeze this aint no finish fight he
panted say jack i cud ha put you
out twict if it was you got some
punch all right but youre carelessin


the popular magazine

blockin them cross counters say in
another month o good hard work you
could stand up to jimmy flynn or kid
allen or black joe r any o them guys
in your class if you cut out the cig-
aroots and dont contribute to no
liquor tax you cn hand his sleepin
powder to most any boob that dont like
your face

  no fear danny jack answered
and reached for his towel im off
it for keeps ive learned my lesson

  then mind you dont meet up with
some of the old bunch and get a fit o
lost memory said danny earnestly
fi had my way id put the whole
country bone dry even if it did cost me
myr job and put this here souse garage
out o business it nearly got me onct
but i took my cure on the island
taint just like this place but it done
the business i got ninety days just
like you he laughed that was
four years ago and i aint tasted a
teaspoonful since and aint a-goin to
he examined his pupil with a critical if
somewhat puffed eye where dye
keep it jack he asked curiously
you aint muscled up none to speak
of

  in my head i guess jack an-
swered me for a swim so long
danny

  the trainer looked after him thought-
fully as he trotted down to the bath-
houses geeze i guess hes right
he said to himself arms and legs
onto him as smooth and round as a
show girl with them little hands and
feet tacked to the ends of em and a
punch like a steam riveter that lad
ud go far in the ring hes so jeesly
deceptivelike sorta soft and mild
lookin in the mug too until he gets
on the job you cant never tell about
them swell guys but this ones sure
got pep  and he massaged the region
of his eye

  jacks reflections as he went down
for his swim were not pleasant the
place was beginning to irk him and
it was only byr the hardest sort of train-
ing that he managed to keep his natural
buoyancy of spirits when he thought
of the long months incarceration still

ahead the worst of it was that the
summer would then be over and that
meant the sacrifice of the cruise to bar
harbor in the new thirty-five-foot yawl
which his father had given him as a
graduation present and which was
probably lying at that moment pro-
visioned and ready for sea at her moor-
ings off the yale yacht club in new
haven harbor where jack had left
her to run home for his sisters lawn
party unfortunately he had gone
home via new york and had there
encountered some classmates and taken
in a ball game and divers other relaxa-
tions with tragic result he had since
written to the club requesting that the
boat be kept there and looked after
until further orders and he did not
believe that his father had so much as
given her a thought

  but as the case now stood he would
be obliged to exchange the confines of
the sanitarium for those of the law
school and his joyous summer holidays
had been dissolved in alcohol because
he had been fool enough to overstep
the bounds of decency and go home
drunk with the added indiscretion of
permitting himself to be discovered in
such a condition by a stern uncom-
promising parent many months must
pass before he might hop to exult in
the rush of free air and the swash of
brine yachting was the only sport
for which jack really cared and he
was an efficient sailorman and here
were the anticipations of the whole
winter ruined by one piece of stupidity
it made him very sick

  turning the business in his mind
jack was of the opinion that the pun-
ishment was not commensurate to the
crime-for he had not the slightest rec-
ollection of the fountain episode or
anything which had occurred after the
footman had assisted him to his room
he had even thought of appealing to
his father for a commutation of sen-
tence for good behavior which might
have given him at least a fortnights
cruise in which to try out the boat on
an offshore run but pride-and the
knowledge that judge oconnor was
sjjbngly opposed to the commutation
the escape

idea-forbade so he had doggedly
stuck to his determination to accept the
decision with as much cheerfulness as
he could muster being only twenty-
three and as sound as a government
bond in wind and limb and strong
mentally the illness following his de-
bauch had lasted only two or three
days and after that he had decided
philosophically that since he was in
he might as well get as much good out
of the situation as was possible to
extract

  he had no fault whatever to find
with his treatment and surroundings
he liked and admired the personnel of
the institution and liked-though he
did not admire-his fellow patients
but these latter had now commenced to
get upon his nerves the most of them
were older men committed by their
families for terms of six months or
a year many were what might be
called repeaters what the french
penal system designates as recedi-
vistes they were unfortunate souls
who so long as the temptation of alco-
hol or other drugs was removed were
able to live and move and have their
beings in a calm and normal way but
who when at large and able to satisfy
their insidious cravings lacked the
moral force to resist their indulgence

  at firsts jack wondered what they
were all doing there or rather wrhy
they were there at all they seemed
so sane and intelligent and healthy
showing no signs whatever of either
physical or moral degeneracy they
were gentlemen and behaved as such
giving no evidence whatever of nerv-
ousness or irritability or discontent
they ate and slept and read and con-
versed and played golf and billiards and
bridge and discussed current events
precisely as might the members of some
outing club who were spending a period
of rest and relaxation unlike certain
other institutions of similar objective
this sanitarium imposed on patients no
apparent regime of habit or discipline
they got out of bed in the morning
when it pleased them took what exer-
cise-they chose ordered what they
wished to eat from the simple though

sufficient menu and smoked when and
where they liked to each one was as-
signed his special attendant or keeper
to be more exact and the duty of this
pleasant and tactful young man ap-
peared to consist as much in the enter-
tainment of his charge as the render-
ing of the requisite bodily service
the attendant was always ready for a
game of billiards or checkers or golf
or tennis or handball or a walk or
merely idle conversation

  it was some days before jack began
to discriminate between patients and
attendants his own mike was rather
an exception being a trained hospital
orderly and usually detailed only for
acute cases which required skilled nurs-
ing the others were in some respects
more accomplished but far less imbued
with that subtle sympathetic quality
which made mike so excellent a pana-
cea for jangled nerves jack discov-
ered also that the personal liberty of
the patients was apparent rather than
real to the casual eye they were un-
der no obvious restrictions but he no-
ticed that each and every inmate of
the establishment was at all times under
the vigilant if unobtrusive eye of an
attendant whether to play golf or ten-
nis or take a walk or merely to stroll
down to the end of the jetty for a quiet
smoke the attendant was always
there

  then after a few days he began to
discover a certain peculiar difference
between his companions in misfortune
and the men of their class he had been
accustomed to mingle with jack could
not possibly have described wherein the
difference lay but he was disagreeably
conscious of it he felt the laxity of
moral fiber the impalpable dullness
and lack of verve it was not that
they seemed emasculated but rather
resigned to a pallid grayness of exist-
ence as though they were the animated
shells of men reacting automatically to
past impulses and requiring the infu-
sion of some outside stimulus to make
them quicken into potent life among
their number was a talented musician
who would seat himself at the piano
play a fewr bars then let his music ebb


the popular magazine

away into nothingness and leave the
instrument with an abstracted air
there was a noted painter but he did
not paint there was a distinguished
author who never took his pen in hand
there was a young man who for two
years had held the amateur tennis
championship and when one day jack
coaxed him to the courts he played a
random and erratic game with certain
flashes of his old form which finally
dwindled into the net in a long series
of flukes leaving jack an easy winner
his opponent did not appear to care

  jacks flesh began to crawl at the
contact with these unsouled entities
he did not know what it was but they
gave him the creeps he found him-
self avoiding them and seeking more
and more the society of the attendants
if only for an after-supper chat

  good lord mike he said at the
end of his first week whats the mat-
ter with this bunch anyhow they
look husky enough but they dont seem
to have the ambish to bat a fly whats
the matter with em 

  rum sor mike answered they
can do nothin without

chapter v

the girl escapes

  fortunately for helen she had never
been on terms of intimate affection
with her father so that she was spared
a disillusionment which might have
done her considerable harm his let-

ter had warmed her to the core but
the proof of his deceit followed it so
quickly that the blow to her newly
roused sentiment for him was mini-
mized

  fierce anger and resentment quickly
crowded out all other emotions helen
had no lack of temperament though
hitherto it had always been smothered
or perverted by drugs avhen threaten-
ing to demonstrate itself and thus re-
vealed as a short-lived nervous crisis
or tantrum subsiding quickly into a
sullen apathy but now with her new-
found health and strength and her fac-
ulties clear and fresh and vigorous her
anger was clean-cut and objective as
righteous wrath is meant to be

  so papa deliberately lied to me
said helen to herself he never
thought of my seeing doctor brights
arrival from europe in the paper he
knows perfectly well that i am entirely
cured and was never better in my life
but he wants to keep me penned up
here so as not to be bothered with me
he wants to take this jaunt out to
california and he doesnt care to have
me on his mind so he lies to me about
doctor bright and leaves me here with
these wheezy old cats-

  helen could hardly be blamed for
this line of reasoning which however
wras not the truth castellane had lied
to her but for what he considered to
be her own good he knew that she
had been poisoned by opiates off and
on during her whole life and doctor
bright had advised a year in the sani-
tarium to accomplish a radical cure
helen knew nothing of this but thought
merely that she was there as the result
of a nervous breakdown from which
she had now completely recovered
castellane realizing this and doctor
bright not being available had stretched
a point in veracity considering that the
end warranted the means

  helen went to her room where for
a while she sat by the open window
looking out across the sparkling waters
of the sound and turning the situation
in her mind she was determined to
quit the place but she could not see
precisely how she was going to man-
the escape



age it she was committed for a year
to the sanitarium with all due legal
form except when in her room the
windows of which were furnished with
a light decorative but efficient steel
grille like all the windows of the insti-
tution she wras always under the eye
of an attendant the grounds were
carefully guarded both night and day
and at night there was always an at-
tendant in the corridor even if an
inmate were to escape the grounds it
seemed doubtful that he or she would
get very far as an alarm would be
sent in immediately to the local con-
stabulary for the sanitarium had
among its patients a number of mild
cases of mental disorders mild men-
tals as they were called but which
might easily develop acute and danger-
ous symptoms

  for another thing she had no money
not a penny none of the patients
male or female had any money she
had her rings but these were scarcely
negotiable security for a runaway girl
patient of a sanitarium worse still
even if she did manage to escape where
was she to go neither friends nor
family could offer any sanctuary nor
would they think of doing so it was
really a very difficult proposition and
for a few moments helen was in de-
spair the place which for the past
six months had been a pleasant re-
treat suddenly assumed the grim di-
mensions of a prison

  but her new-found health and vital-
ity had developed all of her latent cour-
age and determination and helen was
resolved to get out if her liberty lasted
only for a few hours it would show
her father what she thought of his
perfidy and that she was being retained
there against her will by force tnajeur
she realized that escape in the daytime
was utterly impossible and besides she
had no desire to cause the dismissal
of miss cassel her day nurse of whom
she was very fond the night nurse
miss elliot was a taciturn and rather
unsympathetic person for whom she
had no feeling of any kind so helen
decided that if she were to escape at
all it must be at night

  but how  there were the impassa-
ble windows the night nurse and the
attendant in the corridor also the
locked front door helen could hit on
no solution of the problem and the
more she realized her helplessness the
more the enameled fireproofing of her
walls and ceiling seemed to close in
upon and suffocate her and yet the
situation was not without a certain ex-
hilaration like most girls she had
her romantic -streak and the picture of
herself as a prisoner determined to es-
cape furnished a certain thrill of ex-
citement

  for three days she taxed her brain
impotently over the riddle and then
chance favored her helens suite was
on the ground floor and the nearest to
the front door it was about half past
eight of a hot muggy night and she
was in her room reading a magazine
when there came from outside the pur
of a big high-powered motor car
which drew up under the porte-cochere
the next moment a womans voice was
raised in shrill and angry expostulation
which carried a wild hysterical note
the other voices a womans and a
mans sounded in persuasion soothing
and remonstrative

  i wont do it-i tell you i wont-
im all right i tell you what license
you got to shove me into this bug-
house no-you cant fool me i
came here once to see lizzie when she
was takin a poke cocaine cure

leggo me- and there was the

sound of a scuffle and a smothered
scream

  aw come now kitty be reasona-
ble  came the voice of the man

  d- you billy you said we was

goin to the yacht club leggo or ill
jab you

  kitty kitty listen it was the
voice of a woman kit its only for
two or three days-

  and i thought you was my friends

-and-and- sobbingly now

youve gone and b-b-betrayed me and
w-w-want to lock me up in this

d-d-d- another muffled shriek

you aint g-g-got no right-let me


the popular magazine

g-go-o-o- sounded shriek after

shriek and the noise of a struggle

  flying steps came down the corridor
and a crisp authoritative voice said
call doctor lawley-quick john
help restrain the lady gently-careful
not to hurt her this way please
yes we have her room all ready

 then pandemonium the drug-
maddened woman was shrieking her
friends imploring old john the watch-
man puffing and panting soothing ex-
hortations as he struggled with the un-
willing patient and miss elliot the
night nurse directing the proceedings
with curt unruffled directions helen
her heart beating wildly opened her
door a crack and looked out a big
black-haired woman in evening dress
was lashing about like a captive tigress
in the grasp of the others and as helen
watched her heavy luxuriant hair
tumbled down about her creamy shoul-
ders and as with a sudden and violent
movement she nearly freed herself her
corsage was torn loose to expose her
heaving palpitating bosom

  she appeared to be tremendously
strong and to helens shocked eyes she
was like a great splendid fury or a
la tosca her eyes were wild and
staring and there was a froth on her
reddened lips and in her insane strength
she threatened to be more than the
others could manage for miss elliot
merely stood by calmly issuing her in-
structions with no attempt to assist in
restraining the raging virago the
womans unnatural strength appeared
to augment rather than diminish and
she was flinging her captors this way
and that when big doctor lawley sud-
denly appeared on the scene and lent
his massive strength to her control the
group surged down the corridor the
woman screaming and sobbing the nu-
cleus of the whole turbulent group-
and the front door was left wide open 

  heres my chance said helen to
herself she stepped quickly to the
closet got her hat and veil and peered
out the struggling party had turned
the corner of the corridor and the
womans muffled shrieks were growing
fainter subsiding into sobs and stran-

gling curses helen closed her door
and slipped out into the night the
pallid face of the chauffeur was turned
in her direction for a moment but he
made no remark she darted behind
the car crossed the lawn swiftly and
disappeared in a grove of trees where
she knew that there was a path which
led to the golf course about a quarter
of a mile away

  it was very dark but there was a
moon in its first quarter somewhere
behind the muggy heat haze and helen
was able to find her way without acci-
dent her heart was beating as though
to stifle her and yet she was conscious
of a wild exhilaration she was free
never mind for how long she was
free

  she had been waiting for miss elliot
to come in before starting to prepare
for bed but miss elliot had evidently
been waiting for this unfortunate
woman who had just arrived it would
probably be some time helen thought
before her absence was discovered and
by that time she would be far away
and in the direction least expected

  her plan was naturally vague but yet
it had a certain coherence she knew
that the golf course was cut by a road
which led down to a little port to which
she had often walked with her english
nurse miss cassel there were always
a number of skiffs tied up to the jetty
and helen decided to requisition one
of them and pull across for fishers
island where one of her school friends
spent the summer with her family
helen thought it possible that she might
be able to persuade this girl to lend
her some money and clothes and thus
enable her to find a retreat in some
decent boarding house where she might
live under a fictitious name until her
fathers return

  from which it may be seen that
helen had not been taking a course in
current fiction with no result she did
not know this girl particularly well
in fact helen had no intimate friends
and it was more than probable that her
appeal might be in vain but it ap-
peared to be the only hope available
so she decided to take the chance at
the escape



the worst they could do no more than
have her returned to the sanitarium

  oddly enough she was not in the
least afraid at finding herself out there
alone in the dark viscid night her
newly found vitality rejoiced in the
wild adventure the prospect of bor-
rowing a skiff and rowing across the
two-mile stretch of water to fishers
island thrilled her with a sort of ex-
ultation she was a fairly good oars-
woman as her father had a camp 
moosehead lake where she had spent
many summers in the care of miss
morehouse whom she had often rowed
about for brief excursions the gov-
erness lounging on the cushions in the
stern with her drug-ridden brain
soothed by the gentle motion these
exercises had gone far to keep helen
from becoming the utter nervous wreck
which many girls of less stamina would
have got to be under the same poison-
ous influence

  it is rather pitiful when one pauses
to reflect this splendid girl mother-
less from infancy her adolescence
which should in all right have been so
joyous corroded by the evil influence
of a degenerate woman and self-indul-
gent father now getting her first breath
of freedom and the lust of life in her
escape from a sanitary institution in
which in the square deal of human
events she justly merited no place at
all all alone friendless helpless
rather bewildered but happy really
happy for perhaps the first time in her
restricted life

  mothers and fathers please take o
tice you would not place your real
or personal property between the hands
of a hired servant but many of you
do not hesitate to place your children
there what is the inference 

  helen almost romped across the
links for there the space was open
and with no danger of colliding with
trees and benches and things she was
well costumed for her escapade having
on a golf suit of gray linen cool but
tough as to material and resistant to
rough wear her low shoes were of
boys pattern and generous size solid
buckskin the sanitarium was not a

dressy place her hat was a panama
with a veil wound about the crown

  now as she came out on the links
and felt the firm turf under her feet
she was conscious of a sense of free-
dom such as she had never felt in all
her cramped and curtailed life the
place was rather like a moor and some-
thing in its desolation instead of appall-
ing her infused a desire to leap and
dance the murky air wras thinning a
little as a faint cool draft was stirring
from the west bringing odors of dry
sun-baked grass and salty sedge from
the meadows farther up the bight
helen yielded to the impulse and as
she reached the crest where a little
kiosk marked the first tee she flung
her arms above her head aiad pirouetted
in the pale elusive light of the masked
moon then realizing the indiscretion
of such performances on that open
space she was about to hurry on when
to her consternation a dark figure ap-
peared from the shadow of the small
structure

  oh dear said she plaintively to
herself heres one of the guards
now im caught i suppose

  for a moment she hesitated then
the mischievous impulse to give the
watcher a run for his pains swept over
her turning suddenly she sped like
a doe down the long slope beyond

chapter vi

the boy escapes

 wondering what doctor lawley
might have to say to him and in a joy-
ful hope that possibly his father might
have seen fit to commute his sentence
voluntarily jack hurried off to the ad-
ministration building doctor lawley
had never sent for him during his two
months of incarceration and as his be-
havior had been irreproachable jack
became more convinced w-ith every
stride that there must be some good
news in store for him

  come in  growled doctor lawley
who felt that he would have given a
months pay rather than make the an-
nouncement which his sense of fair
dealing had impelled him to do as he
the popular magazine

looked up across his desk and caught
sight of the boys glowing expectant
face his heart sank he had grown
to conceive a great liking for this
youngster who was paying for his fault
with such manly cheerfulness and he
dreaded the approaching interview

  sit down jack said he gruffly
and pull youfrself together for a jolt

  whats the matter  jack asked
seating himself in a straight-backed
chair at the corner of the desk

  well said doctor lawley your
father sailed this afternoon on the
lafayette as you know yre have re-
ceived orders from him that you are
to stick on here for another three
months

  jack came out of his chair like his
jumping namesake what he cried
aghast disbelieving his ears

  thats the verdict said doctor
lawley we were not supposed to
tell you until the first of next month
but that seemed to me a little too stiff
so im telling you now heres a letter
to yrou from your father which may
explain the business and he handed
him one of judge oconnors official
envelopes jack ripped it open and
read as follows

  my dear jack when some months ago
i warned you that another drunken debauch
of yours would mean a term of ninety days
for  in some cure house for alcoholics i
had not counted on the results of such a de-
linquency for yourself and others but as
th e case stands it seems to me that apart
from the damage wrought to yourself by
your last indulgence the mortification and
disgrace which it has brought to your sister
and myself quite warrants an extension of
this term to another three months i have
therefore taken due legal measures to have
you committed to doctor moritz brinkers
excellent establishment until the second day
of november

  in pursuing this step i have been actu-
ated not by the desire to punish you for the
pain which you have causcd jeanne and me
and your many friends but because i have
felt it to be a necessary measure for your
own future well-being since leaving col-
lege and even while there you have been
far too frequently subject to periodical
drunkenness  believe that you are still too
young to have actually formed the alcoholic
habit and i do not intend that you shall do
so if any act of mine can prevent it i have
in my life seen too many good men go to

the scrap heap through drink to take any
chance where my own son is concerncd

  the last time i visited you at the sani-
tarium i was so impressed by the great
change in you as the result of excellent
hygiene and the absence of stimulants that
i decided the treatment ought to be con-
tinued for the rest of the summer in order
to make assurance doubly sure thereafter
no possible cxcuse for a relapse can possibly
offer itself i was further induced to take
this step by observing that you were happy
highly regarded there and rapidly became
such a son morally physically and mentally
as i had always desired you to be

  doctor lawley tells me that you have no
knowledge or recollection of the peculiar
manner in which you ruined your sisters
lawn party and brought disgrace upon us all
not onlj through those present but as the
result of the venomous manner in which a
press hostile to myself and my political
party saw fit to exploit the affair i have
asked doctor lawley to instruct you as to
this and to show you some of the scurrilous
accounts of the incident

  do not think however that i am acting
vengefully or with the desire to make you
pay for our misconduct my object is
merely to stamp on the head of that drink
viper which appears to have got you in its
toils until it shall never so much as wriggle
its tail again affectionately your father

john p oconnor

  jack laid the letter on his knee and
stared at doctor lawley with a white
face and wild startled eyes

 good lord doctor what the
devil did i do  he gasped

  i wasnt there jack said doctor
lawley but this may give you some
idea and he handed him a copy of
a new york sunday newspaper one
full page of which had been given to
a description of the incident a good
part of it was in cartoons of a burlesque
character jacks horrified vision fell
on the blatant leader which was some-
thing like this

oconnor of jeanne of the lady guests
fleeing the spectacle with much display
of skirts and legs of jack being hauled
out by judge oconnor waist-deep in
the fountain a bit of family biography
and the rise of this particular branch
of the oconnors some words anent
jacks college career and his barroom
and cabaret popularity

  the sweat burst out on jacks fore-
head as he perused this public rccord
of his shame but before he had fin-
ished it disappeared and a dull red
glow spread itself over his cheeks
while his light-gray eyes grew hard and
stony he read it through then handed
the paper to doctor lawley

  why wasnt i told about this he
asked quietly

  your fathers orders doctor law-
ley answered

  jack meditated for a moment or two
then remarked in a voicc which was
quite new to him and seemed to con-
tain a certain judicial calm

  theres no question about my hav-
ing disgraced us all of course but i
fail to see in that any excuse for my
fathers having extended my sentence
he admits that i did not have any idea
of what i was doing byhaving given
orders that i was not to be told then
he goes and extends my sentence with-
out a further trial when a magistrate
or justice or judge sentences a man for
drunkenness plus disorderly conduct
he does it all at once and the guilty
person knows about it he does not
send him up for three months and then
tack on another three without the
knowledge of the culprit it is unfair
and unconstitutional and i wont stand
for it

  but see here jack doctor lawley
protested this is a little different
different nothing jack retorted
for hoy long was i committed when
he brought me here

  for three months then when he

  when he saw that i was taking my
medicine like a good sport and profiting
by it he went and tacked on another
three do you call that a square deal
doctor

  b p

  no answered doctor lawley to
tell the truth i dont

  neither do i and i am not going to
stand for it im going out and im
going out the first chance i get and if
i dont get a chance ill make it the
boys handsome face had nothing girl-
ish in it now

  hold on jack said doctor lawley
soothingly you cant do that right
or wrong you are legally committed
for six months and if you try to act
up or make a break well just have to
put you in restraint and curtail your
liberty

  then put me in restraint and cur-
tail my liberty glad of it that lets
me out if anything happens take old
mike off the job and detail one of your
strong arms detail half a dozen of
em if you can hold me all right and
good if you cant so much the worse
for the boozorium no doubt judge
oconnors got drag enough to shove
me into mattcawan if he wanted to
and i wish he would i like you doc-
tor and i appreciate what youve done
for me i like the whole bunch but
my fathers action in sticking on an-
other three months is unfair and un-
constitutional and im going to get out
of here if i have to set the damned
place on fire now you can go ahead
and do what you like about it ive
got nothing more to say

  but look here jack said doctor
lawley dont you see that we are re-
sponsible for you before the law

  of course i see that perfectly
im not blaming you but im respon-
sible to myself and if i were to sub-
mit to such damned tyranny id never
be able to look myself in the face again
so lock me up put me in irons do
any blooming thing you choose i
shant blame you

  but what if you should manage to
make a break and do a get-away your
father as good as told me that in that
case hed cut you adrift and let you
go to the devil in your own way
then ill go to the devil in my own
way and my father can go likewise
in his he can give his money to
jeanne or spend it muzzling the press


the popular magazine

i dont want it i played the game as
long as he did and longer all i want
now is to get out and if you want to
keep me youll have to detail some
guard

  jack leaned back white and panting
his eyes like points of white flame

  very well said doctor lawley
quietly and leaned forward to touch
his bell but at that moment there
came from the direction of the female
annex the sound of a scream followed
by loud voices and excited expostula-
tions doctor lawley paused then
turned to the open window behind him

  what the deuce is all that row
he asked more of himself than of jack

  the sounds of the altercation in-
creased the annex was some hun-
dred yards distant but the night was
very still and the sounds appeared to
be transmitted telephonicallv through
the oppressive atmosphere the clamor
increased and doctor lawley rose to
his feet

  got to look into that said he

wait a minute- and he stepped

out through the long french window

 but jack did not wait there
seemed to him no reason whatever why
he should wait he had frankly de-
clared his intention to quit the place
at the first opportunity which offered
and here was the opportunity he felt
himself to be under not the slightest
obligation moral or otherwise to wait
he much preferred to go in this way
than over the prostrate bodv of an
attendant so he stepped out through
the window which doctor lawlev had
obligingly left open and struck across
the stretch of lawn for the path which
led to the golf links he went fur-
tively seeking the shelter of the rho-
dodendron clumps and glancing back
over his shoulder for signs of pursuit
he was quite ready to fight his way
out with claw and fang should the
occasion arise half an hour earlier
he had felt like a tame rabbit on this
preserve but now the stupidity of those
in a position to control his immediate
actions made him feel like a wolf es-
caped from a trap it is doubtful if
at that moment even the faithful mike

would have found much mercy at his
hands should he have stood in the way
jack oconnor was an outlaw

  but nobody interfered with his go-
ing and presently he struck the path
to the golf links and followed it to the
little kiosk at the first tee there he
stopped to rest and to reflect a little
as to what he was going to do next
he had not a cent in his pockets nor
a hat on his head and he knew that
it would not be many minutes before
attendants wtould be scouring the vicin-
ity aided by a subsidized and discreet
local constabulary wherefore his
thoughts turned most naturally to es-
cape by water and he remembered the
little port about two miles down the
road at the bottom of the hill

  and then like an inspiration came
the thought of his boat lying in new
haven harbor with a week or ten days
stores aboard and all ready for sea
he had left her intending to return
the following day and there were
aboard her clothes and toilet articles
and even his check book in his writing
desk the two friends who were to
have accompanied him on the cruise
to the eastward had departed sadly on
their different ways what more sim-
ple thought jack than to take the
boat and clear out for the hidden inlets
of the maine coast with later the des-
olate reaches and bayous of the south-
ern sounds  he still had a little bal-
ance at the bank and there were quan-
tities of places where he could cash
a check without danger or difficulty

  with this splendid thought in his
brain he was about to start off again
when his quick eye was caught by a
gray figure moving up the slope in his
direction jacks muscles tautened and
his jaw set

 somebodys spotted me he
thought well he wont get me with-
out a scrap if its the boss himself

  he did not try to slip away because
he knew that he would be seen and a
general hue and cry promptly raised
he was in the mood to prefer an im-
mediate show-down when he meant to
try for a knock-out which would keep
his pursuer quiet long enough to give
the escape



him a decent start- so he tightened his
belt and waited

  the gray figure was approaching
swiftly and stealthily and then as it
drew near jack discovered to his as-
tonishment that it was a woman she
reached the top of the plateau about
twenty or thirty yards from the shelter
anil then to jacks horror and amaze-
ment suddenly hrev her arms above
her head and began to pirouette about
in the vague screened light of the
moon

  good lord  gasped jack its a
lady loco thats done a get-away now
isnt that just my rotten luck

  for it had flashed in his head that
he could not in all conscience permit
this poor demented creature to roam
the country at night even at the price
of his own liberty there was the river
at the bottom of the hill and a little
farther down the mill pond there
were also a number of big land-im-
provemcnt operations going on about
he neighborhood and labor camps sit-
uated here and there the following
day would be sunday and these for-
eign laborers roaming about

  no iris duty was very plain this
woman was probably the one whom he
and doctor lawley had heard shriek-
ing and in some way she had made
her escape it was his moral obligation
to see that she came to  harm so
he stepped out of the kiosk and started
to walk in her direction framing some
soothing speech

  she saw him the instant he emerged
from the shadow her dancing
stopped abruptly and for an instant she
stood erect and motionless then
turning suddenly she -ped off down
the slope toward the river with jack
in hot pursuit

chapter vii

boy a xt girl

  helens only object in flight was the
excitement of the chase she reasoned
that her pursuer must be one of the
guards and that he would naturally be
able to catch her on that open stretch
of moor but she meant to give him a
run for his triumph she had no idea

whatever of resistance which would
be futile and undignified but she was
long of limb and fleet of foot and for
the first two hundred yards held her
distance thanks to her splendid condi-
tion from tennis and swimming exer-
cises

  she reached the bottom of the slope
and struck the road but here her breath
began to fail so she stopped suddenly
and faced about panting within a
few yards of her the man stopped also
and walked up himself rather blown

  dont be afraid said he gently
im not going to hurt you

  im not afraid she answered its
just my horrid luck to get caught
you nearly managed it he an-
swered im supposed to be some run-
ner but i couldnt have held that pace
much longer how did you get out
they were all busy with that crazy
woman who was just brought in and
left the front door open she answered
id been waiting for a chance like that
for several days

  jack regarded her curiously and ob-
served that she was a very young and
so far as he could ascertain in the
murk an uncommonly pretty girl she
impressed him also as being entirely
sane and normal

  why did you want to run away 
he asked

  because there is no longer anyr sense
in my being kept in the sanitarium she
answered i have been cooped up
there since early in march and for the
last month i have been entirely well
then i found out that myr father had
been lying to me he wrote me that
the doctors orders were for me to stop
on another few months and i discov-
ered that he had not seen the doctor
at all but was having me kept there
because he did not want to be bothered
with me so i made up my mind to
run away the first chance i got i sup-
pose that you are an attendant and
mean to take me back

  why no said jack to tell the
truth im a patient and ive just done
a get-away myself

  what cried helen and drew back
a little


the popular magazine

  you neednt be afraid said jack
im not a balm or anything like that
my father had me committed here two
months ago for getting drunk and dis-
gracing the family he told me that i
was only in for three months and now
hes gone and got me recommitted for
another three doctor lawley just told
me about it a few minutes ago and
while we were talking that woman be-
gan to scream and he ran over to see
what was going on so i saw my
chance and flew the coop when i saw
you i thought you must be the crazy
woman and that you ought not be let
wander around here alone at night so
i ran after you

 what are you jack oconnor
that boy that dived into the fountain
at his sisters lawn party  asked
helen

  i am ashamed to say that you have
guessed right sh-h-h

  the caution for quiet was none too
soon as two figures had appeared sil-
houetted against the dim sky at the top
of the slope about three hundred yards
away jack seized helen by the wrrist

  here they come he whispered
slip into the bushes across the road
like a pair of foxes they crept into
the scrubby growth which was barely
enough to conceal them when crouched
close to the ground the two attend-
ants came straight in their direction
striking the road a little higher up and
passed their hiding place within two
paces one was ini ike and the other
a tall strapping fellow known as wil-
liam mike was talking volubly

  now there will be the divil and all
to pay said he two av thim the
same jump the lad can take care of
himself but tis no place for a young
gurrul to be chasin around alone and
all thim dagos and huns infestin the
neighborhood the ould mon is crazy
and small blame to him i do not think
she kem this way she would be
afeared tis that lonesome

  they stopped about twenty feet
away and jack thanked the lucky
chance which had led him to put on
a blue serge suit instead of remaining
in white flannels

  there aint anything to bring either
of em this direction said william
but the shoffer says she lit out across
the lawn they cant get fur with no
money nor nawthin

  thank hivins jack was talkin wit
doctor lawley at the time said mike
or  see wrhere id be after gettin me
walkin papers i do not blame the
lad sure the judge had played him a
dhirty trrick double-crossin him like
he done now what if we was to sep-
arate you goin straight on down the
road and me the opposite direction 
this idea was carried out and the
two soon faded into the gloom jack
gave a little chuckle

  that was a close shave said iie
what the deuce are we to do next

you really ought to go back miss-

  never said helen emphatically
my name is helen castellane

  but what are you going to do 
asked jack

  helen briefly told him of her plan
jack shook his head

  that wont do said he positively
in the first place it would be danger-
ous for you to try to row across to
fishers island the weathers going
to change before morning it feels
thundery now listen what did i
tell you

  a low growling rumble filled the air
and a moment later there came a dul
flash from the west the air was heavy
as a steam bath

  what did i tell you jack repeated
well get a thunderstorm within an
hour ill tell you what theres an
old hay barn about half a mile across
the meadows wed better make for
that and stay there until it passes over
to this helen agreed so they set out
keeping off the high ground as much
as possible the storm was coming up
rapidly and presently it grew so dark
that they stumbled along holding each
others hands and unable to see ten feci
ahead of them but jacks sense of
direction was well developed and the
frequent lightning flashes aiding they
soon came to the old barn which was
stuffed almost to the top with fragrant
hay jack gave helen a hand up then
the escape	

scrambled after her and they disposed
themselves comfortably on the sweet-
smelling stuff with the pleasing sense of
having found at least a temporary sanc-
tuary

  why did they send you to old pa
brinkers boozararium  asked jack
stretching- himself luxuriously for he
was tired after his daily strenuous ex-
ercise

  just to get rid of me i guess
helen answered following his example
for precisely the same reason t was
never really ill but i was always tired
and nervous probably from being al-
ways so bored you sec i never had
any of the fun that other girls have
because my governess got it into her
head that i was delicate and contrary
judging from the chase you led me
over the links  should say that you
were about as delicate as a thrce-ycar-
old blue-grass iilly jack answered
and as for being contrary--well that
depends a good deal on the sort of
game you happen to be up against is
your mother alive if you dont mind my
asking 

  no said helen chewing- at the end
of a sweet stalk of meadow grass i
dont remember mv mother

  jack was conscious of a sudden
strong emotion of protectiveness he
also had suffered from that greatest of
all human bereavements

  same here lie answered after
all when it comes right down to brass
tacks i guess that most fathers are
natural born fools where their children
are concerned mine is

  mine is worse helen answered
sitting up in the hay hes a liar
so is mine said jack or at least
he acts the part well most people arc
i dont suppose we really ought to
blame our fathers no doubt they
mean well-and thats damning them
with mighty faint praise they seem
to think that because-because we
wouldnt be here except for them we
ought to be darn grateful he feit
helens arm brush against his as he
shifted his position slightly well
maybe we ought he amended here
comes the storm lucky i happened to

remember this place i hope that bunch
thats hunting for us gets good and
soaked

  a sudden squall of wind struck the
old shack which sheltered them and
thrummed against its dilapidated cor-
nices then came a vivid instantane-
ous glare which flared through the
doorless opening pierced the many
crevices of roof and sides and seemed
to prick out every nail and knot hole
in the flimsy structure followed an
ear-splitting report and a crash as
though of universal dissolution then
a breathless pause followed a deluge
of wind-driven rain for a moment
jack thought that the old barn had
been struck and riven and as he
reached out instinctively with a blinded
sense of protection for the girl his
hand met helens and held it firmly
fie threw his arm around her shoulder
and drew her closer

  dont be seared said he sooth-
ingly its all right-soon be over

  crash bang and this time the
thunderbolt could be heard to hiss and
sizzle as it rived to the heart a gaunt
half-dead oak tree on the lane just op-
posite them helen screamed and
crushed her face against jacks chest
like most highly organized creatures
both the boy and the girl had a con-
stitutional dread of thunderstorms but
jack had forgot his in the desire to
comfort his companion

  there said lie its passed now
went smack over us hayr is a non-
conductor anyhow-just like feathers
cant strike us here all of which he
knew to be quite untrue but served to
demonstrate his recently expressed con-
viction that all men are liars shift
over this way a little helen this darn
roof leaks a little bit bang boom
another thunderclap there  trium-
phantly you sec i was right that
one struck way beyond us its all over
now dont be afraid

  im not afraid jack helen whis-
pered but i have always hated thun-
derstorms

  so have i jack answered they
dont seem to give you any chance to


the popular magazine

hit back there-listen to that one
look helen theres a blaze a barn
or haymow or something never mind
apres nous le deluge and here comes
the deluge  good lord i a savage
gust of wind threatened to lift the roof
off the barn a good deal as one might
remove the lid from a box of sweet-
meats and following this futile attempt
of boreas a cascade descended upon
the ancient shingles happily somewhat
swelled to meet the strain  there she
comes helen said jack never
mind it wont last long and he
chanted an ancient ditty composed by
a famous british admiral for the pur-
pose of impressing certain meteorologi-
cal facts on the fallow minds of appren-
tices 

    when the rains before the wytid
    then your topsl halyards mind

   when the wynds before the rain
   shake your topsails out again

  the squall soon drove past and was
followed by a cool draft of air from
the north fortunately the roof of the
old barn had been recently patched and
but little water leaked through but
jack had been doing some rapid think-
ing even while encouraging helen and
he had come to the conclusion that if
they were to make good their escape
daylight must find them well away from
the vicinity he believed that doctor
brinker would be careful to keep the
affair out of the papers if only for the
credit of his establishment

  if we dont want to get hauled back
by the scruff of the neck like a couple
of runaway pups weve got to get
clear of this neighborhood before
morning he said that scheme of
yours for swiping a boat sounds all
right to me theres a fellow down
here at deep creek that has boats and
launches for hire if we could manage
to grab a launch or a sailboat with a
motor we could beat it down to new
haven before daylight ive got a
cruising yawl there and once aboard
her wed be all right

  but what shall we do then helen
asked

  run around into the hudson and
up to our place my sister jeanne is

a good sport and ill get her to give
it out that youve come to visit youll
be all right there until your father
comes back and then you can put it up
to him

 and what will you do helep
asked doubtfully you couldnt stay
there

  of course not ill clear out on the
boat run down east or something i
can get money enough to keep me going
until the business sort of blowts over
father may be gone three or four
months and by that time ill have been
able to prove that id rather drink a
glass of prussic acid than a glass of
booze

  helen did not appear particularly en-
thusiastic over this arrangement but
she made no demur and the rain hav-
ing stopped they slipped down from
the hay and started across the meadows
for the road the weather had cleared
and the stars twinkled brightly in the
rush of the north wind while the moon
was getting low but still furnished light
enough for them to see their way it
was then about half past eleven

  for about a mile they walked briskly
along in silence and watchfulness busy
with their thoughts jack was by far
the more worried of the two he re-
alized of course that he was doing
what would be regarded as a very
wrong thing possibly a criminal act in
managing the escape of this young girl
from a sanitarium where she had been
placed by her father under the advice
of so famous a specialist as doctor
bright whose name was well known
to him he had no idea of what her
malady might have been nor appar-
ently had she but he reasoned that it
must have been of a serious character
to have warranted so long an intern-
ment to be sure she now impressed
him as in absolutely normal health and
strength both mentally and physically
but for that matter so had his own
fellow captives some of whom had been
recommitted several times what if it
were to prove that she were subject to
attacks of periodical insanity or hys-
teria or epilepsy or catalepsy or some
other of the many ghastly abnormali-
the escape



ties to which in certain cases the hu-
man economy falls heir cold chills
ran down his back at the mere thought
of such a possibility a nice figure he
would cut if it came about that he had
run off with a young and beautiful vic-
tim of some incipient mental disorder

  and yet he did not see just how he
could act otherwise with honor the
girl had told him a perfectly straight
and rational story of having been in-
terned by her father to get her out of
the way and explained to him how she
had accepted the situation with resig-
nation until on seeing the announce-
ment of doctor brights expected re-
turn in the paper she realized that her
father had lied to her and was keeping
her on in the sanitarium to save him-
self the trouble of bothering about her
care jack could readily understand
that while such an institution as doc-
tor brinkers might be a most excellent
place for an ill person it would become
absolutely insupportable for a strong
and healthy one his own experience
quite demonstrated this

  helen impressed him-and jack was
not lacking in a certain amount of ex-
perience-as a very lovely and unso-
phisticated girl who was getting a very
raw and crooked deal moreover they
were practically in the same boat and
she had put herself under his protec-
tion with an absolute confidence which
aroused the very best instincts in his
tempestuous nature and that was say-
ing a good deal to betray her now
and subject her to another period of
incarceration seemed to him to be the
very limit of unchivalry so he de-
termined to see the thing through come
what might of it

  helens reflections were far less
troubled she knew as little about
young men as jack was well informed
in the matter of girls both young and
old she had never had a young man
friend to say nothing of a beau nor
desired one she had never so much
as had her hand squeezed nor a box
of flowers or bonbons sent her by an
admirer it is doubtful if she had ever
been five minutes alone with a boy and
while her attractiveness had awakened

strong sentiments in many a youth who
had covertly observed her at dancing
class or parties or in vacation time on
beach or lake there had always been
the argus-eyed duenna not far distant
which coupled with a sort of apathetic
aloofness  the part of the girl her-
self had been discouraging to these
would-be swains

  but helen was now a different girl
-strong vital and tingling with the
life desire the sanitarium had done
this for her and her act in running
away from it would have been one of
rank ingratitude if she had understood
the situation the action of many peo-
ple toward their benefactors would be
rank ingratitude if they understood
her new-found vigor demanded life
and action and emotion and warmth
and she turned to these qualities as
naturally as a flowering plant growing
in a dark dank room turns its blos-
soms to the sun even though when
placed on a window sill the tendency
of their growth inclines the stems in
an opposite direction

  her feminine instinct drew her to
him at the first few words exchanged
between them thereafter she had con-
fided herself to his care with a happy
sense of security which was pathetic
she had thrilled with some glorious
consciousness of safety when he had
taken her hand and guided her across
the moor to the old hay barn and
when during the storm he had held
her in his arms and reassured her the
terrors of thunder and lightning were
forgot in the stir of new emotions no
paladin in plumes and armor ever
seemed greater to a lady fair than did
jack to helen while the thunderbolts
of jupiter tonans were slamming about
the old shack and boreas was threaten-
ing to unroof it for the first time in
her life she felt unalone the primor-
dial craving for duality was satisfied

  in a word helen had fallen in love
with jack at first sight at first touch
and this age-old reaction was the
stronger because she did not realize it

  so they walked down the road in the
same old way the girl confident and
happy because the boy was there and


the popular magazine

everything had to work out all right
and the boy who had never in all his
life had anything to bother about except
himself was happy too though wor-
ried he had not fallen in love pos-
sibly because he was burdened with the
weight of his responsibility but he
would not have exchanged this for a
great deal the boy had been in love
a good many times but he had never
before been the arbiter of any girls
destiny and he found the situation
fraught with exhilaration he could
feel helens absolute faith in him and
this put him on his mettle and on his
honor it made him feel a man

  as they neared the little port jacks
vigilance increased but the thunder
squall had driven everybody under
cover and drenched the place and no-
body appeared to be moving about
they turned a bend in the road and
the sound stretched out before them
dark and glittering at the same mo-
ment two figures stepped out from the
shadow of a low building and ap-
proached them as they drew near
jack saw that they were not of the
sanitarium personnel but seemed to be
local persons directly in front of
helen and himself they stopped so as
to block the way

  well what is it  jack asked

chapter viii

they both escape

  for a moment the pair appeared to
be embarrassed they were young
men and decidedly hard looking and
might have been boatmen or hands in
the little shipyard jack thought that
he had seen one of them before and
then suddenly remembered him as an
expressman who sometimes brought
trunks or parcels to the sanitarium

  say mister said this one i guess
you and the lady are wanted up to
doctor brinkers place

  thats right said the other they
wrant you mighty bad

  and suppose they do jack an-
swered whats that got to do with
you  are you two on the sanitarium
pay roll 

  well not exactly said the first
speaker but the doctor sends consid-
erable work our way and we agreed
to keep a lookout for you two and
take you back there if we happened
to meet up with you now i got a
little car right here in the shed so if
you and the ady will be so kind as
to get aboard everything will be all
right

  and what if wc wont be so kind
as to get aboard asked jack then
i suppose everything will be all wrong
what 

  look here mister said the other
man you cant put a raw deal like
this across we got our orders so
the best thing you can do is to come
along quiet and peaceable where do
you think youre goin anyhow 

  thats my business jack an-
swered and drew slightly away from
helen his thumbs hooked lightly in
the side pockets of his coat the two
men exchanged glances and edged
slightly in on him the trim boyish
figure did not look formidable and
either of the others could have given
jack ten or fifteen pounds of weight
they knew that their act would be sup-
ported by doctor brinker and the local
authorities and that the former would
make the job utell worth their while
but they had been instructed not to use
force if it could be avoided so they
made another attempt at conciliation

  say listen here  said one of them
you could be jugged for this do you
understand youre in wrong now for
making a break yourself but takin the
lady with you is a whole lot worse and
her a patient and a young girl now
listen to reason and save trouble for all
hands you cant put it across with
us here so you might just as well make
the best of it and come along without
no trouble do you get me 

  yes said jack i get you wtiat
are you going to do about it

  this time there was no mistaking the
look which passed between the pair
if they had been attendants or persons
from the sanitarium acting under due
authority the chances are that jack
would have made the best of it and
the escape



returned without a struggle but to
be held up by a pair of rank outsiders
was more than his pride could support
so as the two sprang suddenly in to
grapple he went forward to meet them
with a perfectly good idea of what he
was about his fierce little bouts with
danny had fitted him perfectly for such
a scrimmage while his uncommon
quickness and high muscular tonicity
made these thick awkward fellows easy
marks for his skill

  so ducking under the grabbing arms
of the man on the right he put a
straight jab with all of his weight be-
hind it squarely on the solar plexus
and then without waiting to observe
its effect he swung a left hook for the
other mans jaw and planted it with
beautiful precision it is doubtful if
two knock-out blows were ever deliv-
ered so nearly simultaneously of
cottrse if it had been an ordinary fight
and the pair trying for a similar re-
sult the finish might have been differ-
ent but as it was they were merely try-
ing to clinch with him little suspect-
ting what he had tucked away under
his loose serge coat

  some men are singularly deceptive in
this regard and jack was one of them
even the experienced danny had often
been startled and surprised at jacks
vicious jabs and had never been able
quite to study out where he kept his
punch everything lies in the quick-
ness with which a blow is delivered
and its precision it is said that a pan-
ther can strike so sharply as to leave
the impression of its claws on a gun
barrel without knocking the weapon out
of the hunters hands and jack had
something of this quality

  at any rate there was no need to
continue the affair his would-be cap-
tors were down and out and jack
glancing at their limp figures decided
that they would take the count in
fact he did not believe that they would
be up and doing for several minutes
so he seized helen by the wrist and
rushed her down to the deserted boat-
house not far distant two or three
skiffs were tied up to the float and far-
ther out a number of boats were

moored among them a small cabined
launch of which the lines suggested
possibilities of speed there were no
oars in evidence but jack picked up a
small piece of plank and helping
helen into a skiff cast off the painter
and proceeded to paddle vigorously for
the launch he thought it probable
that there would be gasoline enough
in the tank as the boats were in con-
stant use and in this he was correct
snapping on the switch he cranked up
and the motor responded with a pleas-
ing whir scrambling forward he
made fast the skiffs painter to the
mooring then cast off that of the
launch and threw in the clutch a
moment later they were gliding rapidly
out into the sound and none too soon
for somebody was shouting at them
from the shore and a moment later a
light flashed out in the upper story of
the boathouse

  that was touch and go said jack
we ought to make it now though
this thing seems to be able to plug
along unless theyve got a speed
launch or something and our gas
doesnt give out well be all right
he reached over the side and dipped
his bruised and bleeding knuckles into
the water it wouldnt do to get col-
lared now that weve stolen a launch
id probably get committed to a worse
place than old pop brinkers rumar-
ium

  im afraid that von hurt those two
men quite badly said helen

  jack shrugged they started it
he answered what business was it of
theirs anyhow they had no right to
butt in and they only got what was
coming to them next time theyll
think twice before doing voluntary po-
lice duty if we fetch new haven
all right ill send back the launch with
a check hello here they come

after us- and he shoved up spark

and gas

  a motor was coughing and sputtering
off the boathouse and a moment later
they saw another and larger launch
glide out in pursuit jack held straight
out until clear of the point and then
catching sight of a buoy swung off


the popular magazine

down the coast looking back from
lime to time he could not see that the
other boat was gaining while their own
motor was running cleanly and well and
the launch making excellent speed giv-
ing the wheel for a moment to helen
he sounded the fuel tank and was
pleased to find it nearly full the boat
had in fact been hired for an evening
spin but the storrn had interfered with
the party

  i jut despite this immediate respite
from trouble jack was not entirely
content with the situation which shows
that he must have been hard to please
although he did not always see fit to
avail himself of it he had a consider-
able amount of common sense and he
realized that he had put both helen and
himself in a very difficult position

  tt seems to be getting thicker and
thicker he told himself first i
jump jail then i steal a girl then i
knock out a couple of deputies and now
ive stolen a launch this heats any-
thing i ever did when drunk and thats
going some but the worst of it is
that if the business ever gets out
helens reputation is sure to suffer
hut what the dickens was i to do
there being no apparent solution to
this problem he put it from his mind
and devoted his attcnion to the present
and immediate future he had ob-
served by the buoy that the tide was
at the first of the flood and from the
speed of the launch he judged that they
ought to fetch new itaven by five
oclock in the morning at the outside
so he said to helen 

  weve got a long trot ahead of us
so you had better go into the cabin and
get some rest especially as to-morrow
is apt to be our busy day

  very well jack she answered obe-
diently and crept into the cabin which
was clean though somewhat redolent
of the odor of gasoline and burned oil
rut these aromas were disregarded in
her fatigue after the excitement of the
evening so disposing herself comfort-
ably on the cushioned locker she was
soon sleeping peacefully while jack
who was entirely familiar with the nav-
igation of long island sound headed

for cornfield lightship wondering
how the adventure was going to end

chapter ix

com ixicatlons

  miss jeanne oconnor had passed a
very tedious summer to begin with
she had missed her brother sorely for
the two were devoted to each other as
twins usually are and jeanne had quite
forgiven his indiscretion the dav after
his having been immured in the sani-
tarium she had passed a number of
stormy interviews with the judge in-
sisting that she be permitted to visit
him there but her father had proved
inexorable to compensate he had
made sporadic efforts to fill the void
left in the family by the absence of the
son and heir and had taken jeanne
and three of her friends on a cruise
to newport and bar harbor in his
eighty-foot motor swifty jeanne this
cruise had bored the yachts name-
sake beyond all expression first because
she thought the judge rather fatuous
in s attentions to her guests two of
whom were very youngand very pretty
and the third no longer young but even
prettier-from a point of view which
disregards graee before meat-and in-
finitely more engaging

  jeanne bad returned from this out-
ing thoroughly disgusted straws show
which way the wind blows and those
sticking out of the tall glasses of the
mature guest and the host as they re-
freshed themselves under the quarter-
deck awnings after the heat of the day
ashore became ominous weathercocks
to jeanne the prospect of a step-
mother looked to her as might a big
black cloud to a french wine grower
or a funnel-shaped one to a kansas
farmer it made her want to shoot a
bomb into it to precipitate the trouble
before it had time to precipitate itself

  but this was not the greatest of her
ennuis the party had been augmented
at newport by a large and capable
young man who had been a classmate
of jack and who desired very much
to marry jeanne as soon as possible
jeanne herself was quite willing and
the escape



prepared to marry him the sooner the
better she desired exceedingly to get
married and he appeared to be in all
ways the most desirable of her several
suitors he was a highly efficient en-
gineer and jeanne thought that it
would be fun to travel to all parts of
the globe with him building dams and
bridges and things

  but alas for these fond aspirations 
ten days of his almost constant society
had convinced jeanne that they could
never possibly get on the girls warm
irish and french blood was first chilled
and then slowed in its rapid circula-
tion by the contact with a purely me-
chanical mind which was wholly utili-
tarian when she admired a stormy
surf he saw in it only power going to
waste and when she gloried in the
beauty of a gorgeous sunset he would
proceed to lecture on the solar spectrum
until jeanne wanted to yawn when
the great luscious midsummer moon
gave her sentimental yearnings he saw
in it merely a satellite of the earth two
hundred and thirty-eight thousand eight
hundred miles distant and shining with
the suns reflected light it was this
way about everything until finally
jeanne became thoroughly bored in his
society and when at the end of the
cruise he proposed matrimony advanc-
ing his claims and specifications as pre-
cisely as though attempting to promote
a railroad or mining property teanne
told him flatly that she would as soon
think of marrying a theodolite or mul-
tiplying machine

  two weeks later he departed for the
andes and jeanne returned home with
the resentful consciousness of having
wasted the best part of her summer and
the strong desire to compensate for it
by some wild and reckless adventure
she had much of her brothers lawless
nature and her college experience had
infused her ith a complete conviction
of her ability to take care of herself
under any conditions whatever she
and jack were in fact ridiculously
alike both physically and temperamen-
tally they were about of a size
though jeanne was slightly more full
of figure of the same dark clear com-

plexion with the identical gray eyes
heavily fringed with black lashes and
distinctly celtic features the eyes well
spaced short straight noses wide
mouths and firm pugnacious chins
jacks face was rather thinner than his
sisters and his nose lacked the
retrousse tendency of hers but this was
scarcely noticeable and they had sev-
eral times deceived their intimate
friends by changing costumes

  at this time that which lent itself
even more to their perfect resemblance
was the fact that jeannes hair had not
yet grown very long after a typhoid
fever of the previous winter but clus-
tered in thick black curls about her
ears she was also well tanned from
her yachting cruise while her discon-
tented state of mind had given her a
sort of abrupt impatience of speech
and manner which was rather that of
an intolerant youth than a sweet girl
graduate her voice also was of a
rather husky contralto uncommonly
deep of pitch for a girl and in its in-
flection precisely that of jacks she
had always been the leader of the two
until they had gone to college

  now on her return to the parental
country house she found that she
missed her brother very sorely she
desired to see him and find out how
he was getting along and judge ocon-
nor departing for europe a few days
later jeanne decided to run across to
the sanitarium and pay him a visit and
the judges positive instructions to the
contrary be hanged she appealed these
to a court of justice composed of her-
self and her most intimate friend and
classmate a miss christine van vol-
kenen who was visiting her at the time
with the result that tudge oconnors
decision was promptly pronounced to
be without proper precedent and there-
fore null and void

  miss christine was a very pretty
blonde with ruddy golden hair and an
exquisite complexion like jeanne she
was quite prepared for any sort of a
lark which might be managed with a
reasonable amount of discretion so that
when jeanne suggested that they take
the fortv-horse-power runabout and pay
	the cpopulj-lcr maqazine

jack a visit she approved the idea with-
out the slightest hesitation christine
indeed entertained a ccrtain tender sen-
timent for jack and she was glad of
the opportunity to show herself his
sympathetic friend in his hour of need

  its only about a hundred miles
said jeanne and the roads are perfect
all the way if we leave at about seven
we can get there easily by noon ill
have james put us up some sandwiches
and things and tell airs trippett that
were going to run over to the fairfield
country golf club to spend the day
we can have a couple of hours with
jack and get home before dark

  but dont you think wed better take
one of the chauffeurs-murphy or mc-
call christine asked its a pretty
long run and wc might get a tire down
or something

  thats not apt to happen jeanne
answered but if it should wed man-
age somehow i got stuck on the
road last summer and before i had a
chance to find out what was the matter
there were four cars parked beside me
and a dozen men at work on the job
flevcn of them were talking to me
and e twelfth was filling up the tank
murphy had been to a funeral and
hadnt got back when i started out
and mccall was down by the river
practicing on the bagpipes and i was
in a hurry and hadnt stopped to see if
i had gas enough of course a motor
cant run without gas anv more than
a politician but all these tanks that had
come to my rescue were full to bursting
so i got started again before dark its
not as if we were crossing the staked
plains

  all the same christine objected
youll be all tired out

  i cant be as tired as ive been for
the last two weeks with about eight
hours a day of lectures on cantilever
bridges and deep alluvions and mason-
work cores and canal prisms and
things jeanne retorted impatiently
after listening to all that stuff a burst
tire or a plugged carburetor seems like
a spoke gone out of the hind wheel
of a dolls baby carriage - besides
murphy or mccall would be sure to

blab and might spoil our running over
to see jack again

  christine offering no further objec-
tions the expedition was promptly mo-
bilized jeanne was by nature an ex-
pert driver if she did often cxceed the
speed limits and her swilt runabout
was as foolproof as modern invention
can assure so the two girls departed
at about half past seven of a lovely
morning at the end of august the tires
of their car scratching the surface of
the turnpike in the same hour when
the object of their kind attentions was
lending his own to the matter of get-
ting in telephonic communication with
his sister with the object of preparing
in some measure for providing sanctu-
ary in behalf of a pair of runaways
from a sanitarium

  both parties being happily in igno-
rance of the complications ahead were
taking a great deal of pleasant inter-
est in the situation particularly jeanne
for this self-willed young lady it
offered possibilities of keen excitement
required by her nature after a very
dull and disappointing summer as the
exhilaration produced by their rapid
course increased she began to form
plans for much more trouble jack in
his three brief letters to her had de-
voted most of the text to his admira-
tion for doctor lawley and what a
strong and sympathetic personality he
was and how uncommonly good look-
ing all of which was to a young lady
of jeannes past successes and desire
for conquest like describing to an en-
thusiastic angler a big trout in a deep
pool difficult and dangerous of approach
or to an ardent hunter the existence
of a record moose or grizzly which had
defied the efforts of all local nimrods

  so as jeanne trundled along at about
forty miles an hour her active brain
was busy with a scheme for effecting
the subjugation of doctor lawley and
tying him to the wheels of her gasoline
chariot then carrying jack off on a
writ of habeas corpus which should be
honored by her captive she had un-
derstood from jack that doctor lawley
was practically at the head of the sani-
tarium doctor brinker doing little
the escape



more than to cash the large checks of
the inmates and potter about the
grounds as jeanne could not recall
of an instance where she had gone after
her prey without success she felt very
optimistic about her plan

  the road was excellent and soon
striking the new york-boston turn-
pike it did not take them long to spin
stamford and south norwalk and
bridgeport behind them after new
haven was passed they stopped at a
neat little inn for clam broth and bis-
cuits then sped upon their course
again it was not yet noon when they
approached the sanitarium and observed
its spacious grounds with pleasurable
excitement rolling up to the main en-
trance jeanne parked the car where
it would not be in the way when she
and christine descended and ap-
proached the door but scarcely had
they taken half a dozen steps when a
neatly dressed young man with a pleas-
ant hibernian face came rushing out
to meet them with an expression of
infinite relief and gratification

  so here yare back sor and the
young lady too  he cried sure twas
dacint av ye to come av your own ac-
cord and the whole place in such a
stew where the divil have ye been
and where did ye git thim duds and
the big cyar  and what have ye done
wit the launch ye shtole nivir has
there been such a roompus in the his-
tory av the institution- and he

looked reproachfully at jeanne who
in riding breeches and gaiters with a
short loose riding coat was staring at
him in astonishment the first thought
which occurred to her wtas that this
must be one of the mild mentals or
slightly deranged patients which jack
had mentioned in a letter but mikes
next words gave her quick wit a clew
to the situation

  sure doctor law lev was fair crazy
sor said he  twas bad enough ye
shud have run away at all and him
givin ye the chance afther yer just
savin ye wud beat it the first chance
ye got but to take the young lady wdth
ye was the limit if ivir it gets out
mike says he  twill be the ruin av

the sanitarmm says he i wud not
have had it happen for a years pay
says he come sor and you miss
the docthor is in his office now tele-
phonin around the country ye will
be welcome as rrain afther a long
drought

  he motioned them to the door and
jeanne who had recovered from the
shock of this reception took her aston-
ished guest by the elbow and passed
in as the entered she whispered to
christine 

  jack must have bolted off with some
girl in the place this man takes me
for jack and you for the girl what
fun  tie up your veil and dont give
the game away we must give jack
time to get out of the neighborhood

chapter x

tiie boy becomes a man

  the thirty-five-foot motor yawl
fleeiga was gliding out past the new
haven breakwater under power jack
at the wheel was cheerfully drinking
coffee out of an agateware cup and
munching hard-tack while helen in the
cabin was experimenting in the thermic
action of a gas flame on bacon and
eggs she had never cooked anything
in her life but under jacks experi-
enced directions was managing pretty
well

  the coagulation of albuminous mat-
ter resulting satisfactorily helen
brought the appetizing mess out into
the cockpit with an air of pride and
the refugees proceeded to fortify their
systems in great content now that the
die was cast and their bridges burned
jack had put aside his misgivings and
decided to make the best of the busi-
ness he reflected that after all there
was not much danger of their escapade
leaking out as the sanitarium would
keep it quiet for its own sake and their
relatives for similar reasons after all
there was no harm done while there
were far worse situations than to be
gliding down the sound in his roomy
comfortable boat with the prettiest and
gamest girl he had ever met for a com-
panion
	the popular magazine

  well said he munching at a lib-
eral rasher of bacon were all right
now shipmate this beats that sultry
hole of a dope house doesnt it

  helen agreed enthusiastically that it
did refreshed by a good nights rest
and a stroll ashore she now felt fit for
any adventure the fact that her
father had deliberately lied to her and
the conviction that his objcct in keep-
ing her at the sanitarium was merely a
selfish one made her conscience untrou-
bled at having run away here was
such freedom as she had never before
experienced and which with her return
to perfect health her soul was starving
for best of all she was enjoying it
with a man who attracted her in every
sense and to whom she had freely given
all her trust and confidcnce-and a little
more

  they must be having more fits back
there than were ever thrown in the
blooming shop since its inauguration
jack observed im sorry for doctor
lawley but t warned him about two
minutes before i did my sprint how-
ever i sent him a note bv the man that

-	j

toolc the launch back saying not to
worry about us as we were all right
and that t was taking you to the home

  r f   j f

oc a tricnrl

  the buoyant expression faded from
helens face

   dont think i want to go to your
sister tack said she were not ac-
quainted and she would be sure to
think it an awful bore besides it
would put her in a wrong position
nothing of the sort jack an-
swered shed be pleased as punch
tills the best sort in the world and
a dead-game sport see the way i put
her lawn party on the blink and dis-
graced the family and she forgave me
smack off wrote and told me so the
very next dav youll find her just like
a sister same as you can look on me
as your brother besides where can
you go without being fired back to the
sanitarium

  all the same i dont want to do it
helen said its too cheeky and i
havent any clothes except what ive

got on id much rather stay with you
on the boat

  but good lord jack protested
you cant do that it aint proper
youve got to be chaperoned and all
that

  im not chaperoned now said
helen and i dont care if it isnt
proper if you wont let me stay with
you on the boat i think id better go
back to the sanitarium at any rate i
shall have had a little fun for once in my
life

  jack set down his coffee cup and
stared at her in dismay then with
a gloomy face he turned the spokes
slowly in his hands and the ficciga
describing a wide arc turned and
headed for faulkener island

 where are you going helen
aked setting down her cup also and
staring at him with a curious gleam
in her violet eyes

  back to the sanitarium jack an-
swered you say that you would
rather go back there than to my sister
so back we go

  but how about vou
im going too i dont like to start
anything that  cant finish wcl we
started this thing together and well
finish it together i must say id rather
be shot than stick it out for another
three months in that dreary ranch with
that bunch of dead-alives but it doesnt
work in with my scheme of things to
put you on the train and ship you back
alone after my having run off with vou
and then beat it mvself i took vou
away and if you must go back ill
take you back and tell them why and
hoy then if anybodv so much as
thinks theres been anything off color
in the business ill be there to knock
that think out of his rotten block
helen did not answer but sat for
some moments staring fixedly at the
dimpling stretch of water ahead and
apparently turning this sudden and un-
expected volte-face of their adventure
in her mind gradually her face sof-
tened and as if unconsciously her
hand stole out and rested on the back
of jacks which was gripping a spoke
of the toy wheel as though steering a
the escape



five-master in a following gale instead
of a play boat in a calm where the pres-
sure of a little finger would have suf-
ficed

  t like you jack she said softly

  i like you helen he answered
without looking at her thats why
im taking you back

  are you sure jack or is it just
because you think ytou ought to-that
you owe it to yourself and the way you
feel about such things 

  both he answered staring rigidly
ahead

  but after we get back she per-
sisted and go on the same way that
weve been going on for weeks and
months with those tiresome people-
dont you think that you might hate
me for having brought yrou back
no i think that ill be able to get

along all right after this- he

glanced at her for an instant then stood
up and took a deep breath helens
hand which had been resting on his
fell limplyr on her knee jack turned
suddenly and picked it up as though
it were something precious which he
had dropped in rising he raised it
to his lips then put it back where he
had found it if they keep me there
for the rest of my life id never hate
you helen he said but theres no
use talking that sort of nonsense now
you steer the boat while i wash the
dishes and get some sail on her for
this breeze thats striking in from the
southwest

  lie started for the cabin but helen
caught him by the sleeve i dont
want you to go back to the sanitarium
jack its not necessary you should
never have been sent there to begin
with and its too awful to think of
your having to spend another three
months in the deadly place but with
me its different im a girl and have
nowhere to go but you wont let me
stay with you on the boat and i sim-
ply cant make myself a burden to your
sister

  then back we go said jack dog-
gedly im not going to skip out and
leave you in the lurch

  for a while they argued the matter

but helens new-found will was as
fixed as jacks meanwhile the fleetga
was gliding swiftly eastward and
faulkener island was soon passed
then the breeze sprang up and jack
not wishing to arrive until after dark
m order to avoid unnecessary publicity
stopped the motor and made sail

  but all of the joy had been quenched
and they drifted along in gloomy si
lence helen sat with her -elbow on
the washboard of the cockpit staring
a the dimpling water with disregard-
ing eves while jack brooded morosely
at the wheel it utterly devitalized him
to think of returning to the tiresome
uninspiring routine and the gray mo-
notonous society of men who had aban-
doned all hope of moral self-supremacy
and whose egos had struck their colors
and surrendered to the direction of
other and stronger minds a sort of
horror seized him and he began to won-
der if perhaps another three months of
internment might not reduce him to the
same level it seemed to him that
prison itself with hard labor and the
companionship of fierce and savage or
stealthy and cunning criminal na-
tures might be almost preferable in
a penal institution ones associates for
all their lawlessness are at least men
in the majority of cases their moral
natures are oblique but not vacuous
positive not negative unbalanced per-
haps from the point of view of the
alienist ruthless savage treacherous
or uncertain in their erratic lack of
equilibrium between weakness and
force but yet strongly vibrant those
of the sanitarium inmates on the con-
trary were merely inert flaccid to the
point of paralysis jack had long since
come to the conclusion that it would be
far better for all concerned to let such
unfortunates work out the curse under
which they lived and moved and had
their being that they might the sooner
return to the melting pot

  and now he was going back to them
of his own accord he was going back
with every nerve and cell and fiber in
his vigorous young body tingling from
high vitality and with a horror of the
poison which had brought him there


the popular magazine

to make him curse the mere thought of
the stuff he did not quite realize what
the sanitarium had done for him in this
respect youth is never grateful for
its unpleasant lessons but he quite
realized that he had learned his as thor-
oughly as it could be learned and that
any more of the same course was bound
to have the same nauseating effect as
too much of what had made it neces-
sary

  then why go back it was not on
his fathers account as he entertained
for that autocratic parent a smoldering
resentment for what he considered to
be an act of injustice and stupidity and
lack of understanding moreover he
was financially independent having in-
herited a small income from the ma-
ternal side of his family so far as the
sanitarium authorities were concerned
he had given due notice that he could
only be retained there by actual force
majcitr and that in his opinion it was
only his fathers juristic prominence
which had made his further retention
legal he wras no longer in his minor-
ity nor was he an habitual drunkard

  but he looked at helen and knew
quite wellwhy he was going back it
was necessary to take helen back and
lie would not let her go alone in their
few hours together he had come to ap-
preciate the extreme defenselessness of
this utterly unsophisticated girl whose
knowledge of the world and its people
was scarcely greater than that of some
child of nature reared in a dream pal-
ace on an enchanted island she was
a miranda who appeared to have been
guarded throughout her life by some
sort of a female caliban and utterly
unable to conceive of danger or pro-
tect herself from it as this appre-
ciation of her character gradually per-
meated jacks mind he thought that he
could understand why her father who
appeared to be much occupied in his
affairs had placed her in the sanitarium
rather than risk her to the care of fam-
ily or servants helen he thought was
actually too innocent to be allowed at
large and the sanitarium served as a
sort of convent without the rigors and
plus the hygienic conditions of the lat-

ter institution it was owing to this
conviction that jack had not insisted
greatly on her going to stop with
jeanne he was quite aware of the
exuberance of his twin sisters nature
and decided that after all she might
be scarcely qualified to fill the role of
duenna for such a girl as helen that
was the brother of it

  wherefore he decided to take her
back to the sanitarium and to have a
man-to-man talk with doctor lawley
about the whole affair jacks brief
was thoroughly formulated in his mind
he would say to doctor lawley some-
thing like this

  i cleared out at the first chance
as i told you i intended to do i met
helen castellane on the golf links and
she told me that she had run away
too because her father had lied to her
about having her committed here for
her health but just wanted to stick her
away somewhere and not be bothered
with her so i took her in charge
meaning to take her to my sister we
swiped a launch and got down to new
haven where my boat was lying my
plan was to run around to our place
near tarrytown and turn her over to
my sister jeanne but when i suggested
this she balked and said that shed
rather come back here and i thought
that perhaps that would be best becai-e
i talked to her and found out what a
child she was and my sister-is no sort
of a chaperon for a girl like that so
i brought her back and here we arc
and now if you want to keep me here
you had better put me in double iron--
because the first chance i get im going
to make a break for it if i have to
strangle good old mike

  this argument was milling in jacks
head as lie gloomed at the wheel then
having arrived at his decision and
pigeonholed it he looked at helen she
looked back at him and smiled some-
thing went wrong with the smile to
judge from its brave uncertainty her
eyes filled with tears which were
promptly winked away leaving the
smile still intact- though slightly dam-
aged around the edges

  dont cry said jack its really
the escape



not worth crying about well be no
worse off than we were yesterday and
think of the fun weve had

  thats what makes me want to cry
helen answered i dont think i ever
had any fun before

  well youre bound ifo have a lot
one of these days

  but i want to have it with you jack
i wouldnt mind it at the sanitarium if
theyd let us play golf or tennis to-
gether

  they wont though said jack
gloomily it will probably be the
lockup for mine

  but why not stay on the boat jack
nobody need ever know anything about
it you wrote to doctor lawley that
you were taking me to a place of safety
and theyll have to be satisfied with
that the boat is a place of safety
id be safe anywhere with you just as
i would with a brother if i had one
what could be more delicious than
this she reached out both arms as
though to embrace the fragrant aro-
matic breeze wafting from the long
island shore charged with odors of
kelp and pine balsam distilled in the
sun think of the freedom of it
jack our fathers have not treated us
fairly and besides they are not here
to bother lets not go back jack
i dont care if it is scandalous i
havent an intimate friend in the world
and ive been kept in a glass case ever
since i was bom now i want some
freedom and some life

  she laid her hand on his arm plead-
ingly and as jack looked up into her
glowing face he discovered suddenly
and for the first time in his life what
it was to be reallyr tempted here was
romance in her most gracious form
enticing him with open arms it can-
not be said that he was in love with
helen though fully conscious of her
unusual charms and this very fact may
have made the temptation even
stronger since love as many a girl has
been fortunate to discover can be a
very powerful protective fqrce it was
pure romance which beckoned and for
a moment tacks warm celtic nature
 p

was on the verge of responding to the
summons it was not as though he had
sought the adventure or meant in any
way to profit by the situation beyond
retaining his personal liberty he had
tried his best to persuade helen to go
to his sister but she had preferred the
sanitarium rather than to risk involv-
ing a girl who wtas an entire stranger
in possible difficulty and jack having
managed her escape and had her in his
protection for nearly twenty-four
hours had no intention whatever of let-
ting her return to face the music alone
he desired to make the explanations
himself come what might of it

  nevertheless it was a wrench he
thought of the pale atmosphere of the
sanitarium and his dull existence there
as it stood in drab relief against the
brilliant picture of sky and water and
the draft of the sweet air striking dflwn
from the spill of the sails here was
tingling vitality in every strong and
vigorous sense his stanch comforta-
ble boat was under him and at his side
this lovely eager girl begging to sail
awayr with him into the unknown quite
content to give him a sisterly confidence
which he knew that he wtould never be-
tray she had told him that she was
practically friendless even homeless
and a care to a selfish brute of a father
who had chosen to commit her to a
sanitarium rather than to take the trou-
ble to occupy himself with her wel-
fare jack did not believe that helen
could ever have been really ill or in
need of the treatment it seemed to
him a sheer case of tyranny

  nevertheless his own experience of
the world told him that it would not
do sooner or later the escapade might
be discovered and helens good name
further imperiled it was certainly no
part of a professed brother to take a
young and innocent girl off cruising on
his little yacht for an indefinite period
of time better another term of im-
prisonment than that so he shook his
head with a sigh and answered in a
voice which admitted of no further ar-
gument 

  it cant be done helen it wouldnt

jeanne looks ix

  doctor lawley had spent a very
strenuous night first there had been
the refractory lady with her system
overflowing a combination of cocaine
and alcohol and he had scarcely got
her to some extent soothed when
helens absence was reported rush-
ing out in dire dismay to investigate
this catastrophe the young doctor was
met by mike who informed him that
jack also had disappeared

  no such shocking scandal had ever
befallen the sanitarium men patients
had indeed been known to elude the
vigilance of an attendant and slip off
in quest of their alcoholic affinity hut
these had been quickly apprehended
and in such a case the attendant was
promptly dismissed no chance being
given him to offer a word of excuse
none of the patients were permitted
any pocket money and the institution
had its confidential agents distributed
variously about the vicinity

  but here was a double escape that
of jack being due to the carelessness
of doctor lawley himself in bolting
off and leaving the long french window
open behind him immediately after tack
had warned him that he would make
the break at the first opportunity which
offered itself and that only physical re-
straint would keep him any longer in-
terned mike was in no way to blame
the custody of his charge having been
temporarily relieved

  but doctor lawley did not worry
particularly about jack he was a
young man quite in possession of his
normal faculties and thoroughly com-
petent to take care of himself what
struck horror to the directing physi-
cians soul was the thought of a young
and helpless girl like helen roaming
about in the darkness and a thunder
squall making up in the northwest the
neighborhood was a rather desolate

one and the doctor thought it probable
that she would get lost before going
very far he was nearly beside himself
with anxiety

  the searching party was quickly and
quietly organized doctor lawley him-
self directing it neighboring villages
and houses were notified by telephone
also the local garages livery stables
and railroad station it did not seem
possible that the fugitives could get
very far with no money and all the
points of egress from the vicinity
watched and the young doctor was
convinced that daylight would find
them both taken in charge again but
meanwhile there were for helen the
dangers of the night with the exposure
to the elements and the risk of encoun-
tering prowlers from the big labor
camps which were located here and
there at no great distance by the land
improvement company

  doctor lawley did not think it prob-
able that jack and helen had met a
the womans annex was several hun-
dred yards removed from the main
building occupied by the men and be-
sides both would naturally be trying
to avoid any person encountered
knowing jack to be a yachtsman he
wisely concluded that he would be very
apt to attempt escape by water so he
telephoned to the store at the little port
to have somebody on the lookout and
dispatched an attendant in that direc-
tion he himself ordered his car and
proceeded to scour the highways and
byways stopping to question such few
people as he met then the thunder
squall broke in all its fury and he
found himself nearly distracted at the
thought of the girl confided to the in-
stitutions care which was to say his
care cowering under some tree
drenched and terrified and lost had
he known that she was at that moment
comfortably tucked away in the hayloft
of an old barn on the moor comparing
notes with her fellow fugitive he might
have been partially reassured but not
entirely

  at two oclock in the morning he re-
turned to the sanitarium hoping that
others of the searching party might
the escape



have been more successful the men
attempting to arrest the refugees at
deep creek had joined the boatman
in the pursuit with another launch not
stopping to telephone and the three
were at that moment drifting about
writh an empty fuel tank some five miles
offshore

  so doctor lawley started out again
and did not return until about eight
oclock on entering the grounds he
was met by danny the trainer and
the hard face of that athlete wore an
expression of ill-concealed amusement

  jingo doctor said he they
pulled it off all right i knowed jack
was some scrapper but id never ha
thought he- could of got away with two
big stiffs like them guys down to the
landing and he proceeded to detail
the escape with a gusto in which pro-
fessional pride in his pupil quite over-
bore his loyalty to the interests of his
employers

  doctor lawley groaned in spirit so
the runaways had forgathered after
all stolen a launch and made good
their escape they might have gone
to any point on either side of the
sound and the chances of their re-
capture now seemed very slight there
being nothing to do about it however
he bathed and changed and went about
his routine work

  after luncheon being thoroughly
jaded he closed the shutters of his
roomy office and flung himself down on
the divan for a short nap he had
fallen into the sleep of exhaustion when
he was roused by the faithful mikes
rapping at the door

  well what is it he growled sit-
ting up with tousled hair and the
sleeves of his shirt rolled back from his
big muscular arms

  sure they are back docthor said
mike beamingly

  what cried doctor lawley mr
oconnor and miss castellane--

 true for you sor they kem
rowlin up as fine as ye please in a
big cyar mr oconnor is rigged out
in a gurruls ridin suit and a new
panyma hat they are here in the cor-
ridor beyant

  well ill be- send em in

  he flung his big frame into his offi-
cial chair mystified beyond expression
there was a rustle from without then
jeanne and christine entered mike
closing the door discreetly behind them
for a brief instant doctor lawley
thought it was indeed the runaways
jeannes likeness to her brother being
so exact while christines features
which somewhat resembled those of
helen were partially concealed by a
white tulle motor veil but although
many would have remained deceived
doctor lawleys keen powers of ob-
servation and perhaps also some mas-
culine instinct told him almost imme-
diately that the trim figure in the rid-
ing suit was of the feminine sex he
knew also that jack had a twin sister
and realized at once that this must be
she it likewise flashed across his
mind that he had never seen a prettier
saucier and generally more fascinating
female face

  as for jeanne she found this big
handsome physician with his strong
kindly face and keen compelling eyes
quite all that her brother had described
in the matter of physical attractiveness
and she was very glad that she had
come a sudden mischievous impulse
urged her to have a little fun with him
so she said in her throaty voice which
was smoother but more deeply pitched
than jacks

  well here we are again doctor
so it appears answered doctor
lawley and jeanne felt slightly un-
easy there was something in the look
of his eyes which disturbed her why
did you come back once you were
clear away 

  we came back to relieve your anxi-
ety jeanne answered but we havent
come to stay

  oh feavent you  murmured doc-
tor lawley why not 

  because we dont want to jeanne
answered and she felt rather foolish
she had wanted to say something clever
and sparkling but there was a certain
quality about this young doctor which
took the effervescence out of her a good
deal as a swizzle stick relieves cham-


the popular magazine

pagne of its surplus gas she discov-
ered suddenly that she was still ex-
tremely young in the presence of an
intelligence which was so thoroughly
trained to follow the vagaries of the
human mind

  that seems to be a perfectly good
reason-from your point of view
doctor lawley answered well what
then 

  he leaned back in his desk chair
stretched his big arms and clasped his
hands behind his head he yawned
and jeanne received a shock his teeth
were so very white and even and his
eyes had the sleepy look which one sees
in those of a caged lion when the ani-
mal is reflecting and its thoughts are
behind those passive disks but jeanne
was of irish stock which is to say com-
bative and there was a certain quality
in this big young man which roused
her pugnacity even while it fascinated
her she had no doubt but that doctor
lawley took her for jack and christine
for whatever girl it was with whom
jack appeared to have escaped from
the institution the room was dark-
ened against the glare from without
and jeanne reasoned that if jacks spe-
cial attendant mike had been fooled
in the full light of day there should
be slight chance of this sleepy young
doctor who appeared to have just
awakened from a nap having any sus-
picion of the false identity

 we came back here because we
thought it only decent to relieve your
anxiety doctor said jeanne but hav-
ing come of our own accord we felt
sure that you would not take advan-
tage of it and keep us here by force
now that vou know that ave are all
right we should like to leave

  doctor lawleys keen eyes twinkled
but he shook his head

  im afraid that cant be allowed
he answered so far as my own pro-
fessional opinion of your two cases is
concerned there is no longer any neces-
sity of-detaining either of you but
you have been committed to our care
with all due legal formality and we
have no right to permit of your leaving
until so authorized

  christine looked rather scared at this
decision but jeanne threw her a warn-
ing glance she was thoroughly enjoy-
ing her joke on this authoritative young
doctor and desired to carry it still
farther before declaring her identity
besides she found his personality so
decidedly attractive that she was loath
to bring the conversation to a close

  of course i understand your posi-
tion doctor said she but neverthe-
less i must insist on leaving if not with
your permission then without it
doctor lawley shrugged his big
shoulders do you think it quite the
honorable thing to risk miss castel-
lanes reputation by escorting her
around the country unchaperoned  he
asked

  nobody need know anything about
it jeanne answered we are going
to motor straight back to my fathers
country place and miss-castellane
will be my sisters guest

  doctor lawley rose if you will
step into the other room for a moment
i w ill explain to you certain reasons
why miss castellane must remain
here said he

  jeanne hesitated for an instant then
curiosity to learn more about the girl
with whom jack had escaped from the
sanitarium overcome her scruples
very well she answered

  then come this way please said
the doctor he opened a door and led
the way through a short corridor off
which was a simply though comfort-
ablyr furnished room motioning
jeanne to enter he himself remained
standing on the threshold sit down
please said he pleasantly and when
jeanne had complied he said miss
castellane has been for a number of
years the unconscious habituee of the
opium habit she had an unscrupulous
governess who was herself addicted to
the drug and who used to administer
it at frequent intervals to her charge
the habit is now quite broken but the
specialist under whose advice she was
committed here advises that she remain
here two or three months longer so
you see we are bound to detain hr
i see jeanne answered feeing
the escape



that her joke had gone quite far enough
she was on the point of proclaiming
their identities when doctor lawley
interrupted

  as for yourself said he we feel
that you have done very wrong not
only in running away yourself but in
assisting at the escape of this young
girl we feel also that under the cir-
cumstances we are quite justified in
taking drastic measures i would there-
fore advise that you accept the situa-
tion with as much patience as possi-
ble

  he stepped back quickly across the
threshold swinging the heavy door shut
behind him before the astonished girl
could protest the next instant she
heard his step going down the corridor
and the closing of the door at the other
end

chapter xii

sauce for the geese

  miss christine van volkenen waited
the return of jeanne and doctor law-
ley first with impatience and then with
a growing nervousness she could not
understand the protracted interview
and was growing more and more fright-
ened and mystified when a capable-
looking woman with a face which was
rather austere entered the officfe

  will you come with me please
she said and the tone of her voice sug-
gested a command rather than a re-
quest

   i am-am waiting for doctor law-
ley-and my friend stammered chris-
tine

  yes i know doctor lawley sent
me for you come please

but-but im afraid there has been

a mistake- christine faltered

  oil no its all right the nurse
answered briefly doctor lawley un-
derstands

but--are you quite sure he

thinks that i am-that i am-

very well just come with me
please and you can explain later the
doctor has been called to see a patient
but where is jeanne-miss ocon-
nor asked christine desperately

  doctor lawley will explain every-
thing answered the nurse soothingly
but you cant stay here you know i
have my orders so i think that you had
better come with me now

  thoroughly bewildered and fright-
ened christine obeyed she did not
wish to upset jeannes plans in regard
to jack but she decided that the affair
had gone quite far enough the nurse
however was quite impervious to her
attempts at gaining information and led
her by a path through the gardens to a
large and comfortable-appearing build-
ing some three or four hundred yards
away christine observed a good many
ladies strolling about with nurses and
reading or chatting or taking tea in the
high shade of the trees she felt very
dazed and upset but decided that since
she could make no impression upon her
guide the only thing to do was to accept
the situation until it cleared she re-
alized of course that she wras being
taken for the girl with whom jack had
run away but since jeanne was not
there and the nurse would not listen
to her there seemed nothing to do about
it but wait for the denouement of the
affair

  so she went along submissively re-
senting jeannes extravagant behavior
even while trying to make the best of
it and was conducted up the steps of
the broad veranda and into the build-
ing where just inside the front door
the nurse showed her into a spacious
bedroom then before christine quite
realized what was happening the nurse
said briefly

  i shall have to lock the door miss
castellane but thats your own fault
for running away you know miss
cassel will be in directly meantime
youd better lie down and rest a bit
and then the door closed and chris-
tine found herself a prisoner

  doctor lawley was fond of his little
joke too

  meantime jeanne locked up in the
confinement room for violent patients
was in far from an amiable mood
could she have seen doctor lawley
going about his routine work with a
grin lurking about the corners of his


the cpocpulflcr magazine

mouth she would have been even less
amiable

  as a matter of fact she did not
blame him very much for having locked
her up she blamed herself for hav-
ing walked into such a trap doctor
lawley took her for jack of course
and if jack had been fool enough to
connive at the escape from the sani-
tarium of a young girl who was a vic-
tim of the opium habit and then the
double fool to bring her back there
again it seemed to jeanne that he de-
served to be locked up there for the
rest of his silly life

  however after the first shock of
finding herself a prisoner she did not
take the situation very seriously be-
cause ihe did not think that it could
possibly last more than a few minutes
and jeanne was a good enough sport
to accept the back fire of a bad joke
she reasoned that christine would
quickly explain the situation when
there would be profuse apologies with
immediate release but when an hour
had passed with no attention having
been paid her jeanne began to feel
the desperation of the newly encaged
her first instinct was to shriek and
yell and draw the attention of some-
body to whom she could explain her
false position but she was deterred
from doing this first because her pride
forbade and secondly because her com-
mon sense told her that shrieks and
yells in such an institution would prob-
ably attract as much attention as they
might in the infant ward of an orphan
asylum

  there was a bell in her room and
at the end of an hour and a quarter
of solitary confinement she began to
push it in staccato time and could hear
it dinning somewhere not far away but
presently the sound ceased and she
knew that it had been suppressed and
that she might expect to receive atten-
tion at the time ordained and not be-
fore the prison consciousness then
striking her with full force she began
to examine her confines with impatient
curiosity these consisted of two plain
fair-sized rooms and a bathroom the
windows were iron-grilled and looked

 out over the edge of a terrace which
 dropped steeply into a ravine there
 was also a large closet and in this she
 discovered her brothers extensive
 wardrobe evidently these apartments
 had been prepared for his reception

   the double doors were very solid
 while walls and ceiling were fire-
 proofed and jeanne thought it probable
 that they were soundproofed as well
 the place seemed a very practical and
  comfortable young prison but as
 jeanne thought of her brothers intoler-
 ance of any sort of restraint the idea
 of his being cooped up there struck
 her with a sort of horror also it
 filled her with a hot resentment against
 her father for having subjected jack
 to such an ordeal yet she did not
 blame doctor lawley it was a very
 serious offense to run off with a young
 girl who was under treatment for a
  drug habit and she wondered that the
 doctor had not censured her more
 severely she flung herself into a chair
 and was reflecting pensively on the at-
 tractive personality of doctor lawley
 when the door opened quietly and the
 object of her consideration entered
 for an instant he stood looking at
 jeanne with an expression of thought-
 ful curiosity then closing the door he
 crossed the room and seated himself in
 a wicker armchair by the window fac-
 ing her

   well said jeanne i suppose you
 have found out who i really am 
 yes doctor lawley answered
 then youve probably come to offer
 your apologies 

   no on the contrary i am waiting
 for yours

   jeanne stiffened up in her chair
 what have i got to apologize for 
 she demanded

   deceitfulness answered doctor
 lawley perhaps you may consider
 it a very smart joke to come here and
 palm yourself off as your twin brother
 and miss van volkenen as miss cas-
 tellane but i should call it by another
 name you probably cant realize the
 anxiety that i have been under-and
 am still under it may cheer you up
 to know that this business is apt to cost
the escape



me my professional reputation and very
possibly my position

  he spoke quietly enough but jeanne
was conscious of a sinking sensation
under her costal arch which is to say
under the ribs for the first time she
observed the worn tired and worried
expression of his face and a sense of
shame swept over her

  ive been up all night scouring the
country for this pair said doctor
lawley leaning forward elbows on
knees and hands clasped your
brother jack can run off and be hanged
to him but this girl helen castellane
is quite another kettle of fish i
couldnt have believed that jack would
have played that sort of a game--nor
his sister either

  jeannes self-abasement increased
the whole affair as presented from
this point of view suddenly took on
an entirely different aspect jack in-
stead of being a dashing and debonair
hero of a romantic adventure and the
maltreated victim of a stern and un-
compromising parent assumed imme-
diately the proportions of a silly young
rake while she herself presented the
picture of a foolish and pampered
young person who had tried to play a
practical joke which had reacted
against herself in most inconvenient
fashion and put her in the position of
some chicken-headed schoolgirl with no
sense of proportion or the fitness of
things it was most humiliating for a
recent graduate of vassar

  but jeanne like jack was game and
took her bad-tasting medicine without
gulping she leaned back in her chair
crossed her gaitered legs and reflected
for an instant before speaking doctor
lawley watching her keenly without
appearing to do so thought that he had
never seen a more fascinating sketch
of the typical american girl who can
be light-headed at one moment and in-
tensely level-headed the next accord-
ing to the turn of events

  then her forensic mind inherited
from a race of distinguished jurists be-
gan to assert itself and her quick celtic
wit was put to the service of doctor
lawley whom she felt to have been

grievously wronged shesaw jack and
herself entirely at fault and her whole
energy was immediately requisitioned
to right the affair it was a curious
fact that these twins brother and sister
should have been at the same identical
moment working out the same principle
to do the honorable thing to square
the deal here was jack voluntarily
returning to his prison and here was
jeanne who but a few moments before
had been filled with horror by her in-
spection of the bounds prepared for the
reception of the brother to -whom she
was so devoted now lending the full
of her intelligence to fetch him back
to them

  wherefore with her gray eyes fixed
on doctor lawleys she requested him
to give her the full particulars of jacks
escape and what part miss castellane
had played in it then having heard
the terse description of the affair she
thought it over for a moment and said
they couldnt possibly have ar-
ranged it beforehand could they 

  of course not doctor lawley an-
swered they had both made up their
minds to bolt at the first chance and
the same incident gave them both their
chance they must have met some-
where on the moor and made a com-
mon causq of it

  then jack didnt run away with her
at all said jeanne i dont think
that the idea you gave me was fair
to jack do you 

  perhaps not doctor lawley ad-
mitted all the same when he met
up with her he ought to have brought
her back he knows just as well as we
do what would be said about her if
the facts of the case were to be known
-and usually they are sooner or later
she must have told him that she had
no place to go what do you suppose
he intends to do with her  ive made
quite a study of jack and i know that
she would be as safe with him as with
her own brother if she had one but
what the dickens could he do with a
girl like that

  jeanne leaned back in her chair and
looked at his puzzled face with a mock-
ing little smile pushing up the corners


the popular magazine

of her red lips cant you guess she
asked

  ill be darned if i can answered
doctor lawley

  and you such a wise doctor man
sighed jeanne and understanding
jacks character so well what could
he possibly do with her but bring her
to our house and let me take care of
her he knew that i was there
but how could he get her there 
doctor lawley protested they
hadnt any money or anything

  jack doesnt need any money
jeanne retorted hes got plenty of
friends besides that didnt stop him
from getting a launch did it

  no doctor lawley admitted but

all the same-

  all the same hes there by this
time said jeanne ill bet you an
airedale pup that jack and miss cas-
tellane are at our house this very min-
ute and that jack is having fits because
im not there it doesnt matter much
because miss tibbetts will be having
fits too but that wont prevent her
from looking after miss castellane
she leaned back in her chair and
looked like a character study of mali-
cious mischief her pussy-willow-col-
ored eyes examining her jailer through
a double fringe of black lashes which
were almost together they are over
there now she said and ill bet you
two airedale pups if you like do
you take me 

  doctor lawley rose and stepped to
the window he did not appear to have
been listening to this impassioned out-
burst nor to have any interest whatever
in airedale pups on the contrary he
seemed to be turning something in his
mind jeanne was conscious of a
strong desire to throw something at
him but there was nothing in the room
to throw except the chairs and they
were rather unwieldy

  why dont you say something she
demanded do you take me or dont
you 

  doctor lawley swung about sud-
denly jeanne impatient at his delayed
answer was startled at the abrupt
swing of his big lithe body she was

expecting some sort of personal reply
and quite nerved to meet it instead
he answered very quietly

  i think that your car must be at
the door miss oconnor please par-
don this mistake which has not been
entirely our fault as you must admit
miss van volkenen is waiting for you
on the veranda i am very sorry to
have delayed you and i hope that if
you get any news of your brother and
our other patient you will be kind
enough to send me a wire or drop me
a line he reached in his pocket and
drew out a note i have just received
a note from your brother saying that
they have arrived safely in new haven
and that he is taking miss castellane
to some friends who will look after
her this naturally relieves my mind
of considerable anxiety and from what
you have just told me i imagine that
your idea of their destination is quite
correct they are probably at your
fathers house so the sooner you get
back there the better

  jeanne leaped to her feet with a flam-
ing face will you please be still 
she cried if they are there i shall
send them both straight back to this
prison i-i-i dont want you to

think-

  i shall try not to doctor lawley
answered we tried to do our best
for them both but apparently they
wrere not very appreciative

  he unlocked the double doors and
threw them wide then stepped aside
with a slight bow jeanne rose to her
feet and was in the act of passing out
chin in air when she narrowly escaped
a violent collision with mike this
faithful attendant braked hard stared
at her for an instant then seeing doc-
tor lawley on the threshold threw up
his hands with a gesture of despair
docthor lawley cried he i have

  well what of it mike  asked doc-
tor lawley in a calm voice

chapter xiii

the girl becomes a woman

  the southwest breeze freshened
steadily bringing with it a haze and
gradually assuming the character of
what is known to yachtsmen of the
region as a smoky souwester and
before long the fleetga was slipping
through the water at a speed which
promised to fetch deep creek in the
middle of the afternoon

  jack and helen had fallen silent at
the prospect of returning to their
prison the very exhilaration of their
surroundings resolved into a mockery
rather than a joy but it was impos-
sible for two young and vigorous per-
sons to remain long in a state of de-
pression under such highly vitalized
conditions no matter what might lie
ahead the rush of the wind and dash
of spray made settled gloom impossible
for the moment and presently helen
began to sing she had a strong pure
mezzo-soprano voice which had re-
ceived a certain amount of random
training at odd intervals and now as
if inspired by the elemental forces
about her-and something else perhaps
-she burst as if unconsciously into
some of the sweet old scotch songs with
their hint of melancholy

  jack listened surprised at first by
this -unexpected accomplishment then
fascinated he was not musical him-
self but he was a music lover and it
seemed to him that he had never heard
a more appealing voice or one that lent
itself more charmingly to the mise en
scene also aside from the plaintive
melodyr welling so easily from her
young throat helen as she stood there
holding to a lee runner and her lithe
beautiful body swaying to the motion
of the boat was a sight to fire a far
less ardent nature than jacks up to
this moment he had thought of helen

merely as a very young and amazingly
unsophisticated girl whom circumstance
had thrown in his path as a responsi-
bility and a care and of whom the con
scientious discharge of his duty meant
the deprivation of his liberty for some
months to come

  but this viewpoint was now suddenly
changed and as though she had sud-
denly stepped forward into a different
light he saw her for herself for what
she really was and was destined to be-
come with no reference to his own
selfish interests previously he had sur-
veyed her in the negative and now in
an instant as though the suns bright
rays had printed her personality he saw
the real living breathing intensely liv-
ing helen the lovely maiden standing
on the threshold of an even lovelier
womanhood it filled him with a curi-
ous sense of shame that he had been
so late in appreciating her the return
to the sanitarium lost suddenly all of
its bitterness

  with this awakening came also the
realization of her sweet strong nature
he thought of her fearlessness in run-
ning out alone into the night to find her
freedom of the unshrinking courage in
facing him when he had overtaken her
and of the pluck with which she had
controlled her terror of the thunder-
bolts crashing about the old hay barn
he remembered with a thrill which
he had not felt at the time of how he
had held her while she buried her face
against his shoulder then came rec-
ollection of the game spirit in which
she had gone aboard the launch and
out in the dark sound and later her
pride and savoir-faire in absolutely re-
fusing to involve his sister in the affair
preferring rather to return to the sani-
tarium and now here she was bravely
singing her swan song full-throatedly
into the stiff breeze before returning
to her prison

  jacks heart seemed to swell within
him some girl said he to himself
i guess im just beginning to get her
number

  then you go the high road and
    ill go the low road

  and ill be in scotland before you-


the popular magazine

sang helen and little shivers ran down
jacks spine his disease was over-
whelming his system with no prelimi-
nary malaise or period of incubation

  and me and my true love will never

meet again- helen sang

 oh yes you will said jack to
himself only it wont be on the
bonny bonny braes of loch lomond
it will be on the bonny bonny braes
of doctor brinkers boozarium if i
have to challenge good old mike to a
half-mile cross-country run

  the gloomy anticipations of reincar-
nation were now slipping off jack a
good deal as a cicada sheds its shell
and spreads its gauzy wings for flight
into a new and rosy world it is one
thing to offer ones person to peniten-
tial duress for honor or conscience sake
and another for the sake of love

  how long does it take to fall in love
authorities differ widely on this impor-
tant question but the best of them ad-
mit that given certain conditions the
onset of the malady is almost instanta-
neous taking no longer than is required
by the transfer of a stimulus from the
retina to the central nervous system-
as in the case of dante and beatrice
mr william shakespeare also offers an
expert opinion on -the matter of love
at first sight but of course these re-
actions are generally acknowledged to
occur more rapidlyt in the case of poets
whose receptivity to them is apt to be
in a ratio inverse to the square root
of their constancy

  jack not being a poet in the usual
sense but on the contrary a rather
slangy young philistine whose amorous
propensities had hitherto been confined
to his senses rather than the seat of his
soul now discovered all at once a
hitherto unsuspected soul of course
the soul had always been there but
like an obscure and very reticent neigh-
bor jack had never made its acquaint-
ance it was love which introduced
him to his soul

  helen stopped singing as abruptly as
she had begun stood for a moment
staring out across the white-capped
water then turned and looked at jack
with some of the mist in her blue eyes

  i dont think that i ever really
wanted to sing before she said

  well you are going to feel like it
a lot from now on jack answered
i guess that old pa brinkers shop has
done you a lot of good after all

  of course it has she answered
running away from it has too but
i dont much mind going back there
jack i wouldnt mind at all if it wasnt
for you she seated herself at his
side and dropped her hand on his as it
held a spoke of the wheel do you
feel cross with me jack for wanting
to go back instead of going to your
sister 

  how about you said jack are
you sore with me for taking you back
instead of sailing around like this on
the boat

  helen shook her head i think that
i love you for it jack you are taking
care of me i dont think that anybody
ever bothered much about me until i
met you

  then ill tell you this much said
jack and you can tuck it away in
your forepeak under that bale of gold
straw on the top of your head some-
bodys going to bother about you a
whole lot from now on-and that guy
isnt a thousand miles away but you
shouldnt say that you love me for tak-
ing you back you like me for it per-
haps-but a girl cant love a man as
quick as that

  oh cant she helen answered
and stared pensively out across the
hazy wind-swept stretch of water
the southwest wind was raising its
velocity notch by notch and the fleetga
was tearing her wayr to the eastward
as though in a hurry to hunt a shelter
and get rid of her responsibility before
things began to happen jack easing
the sheet a little began to feel the same
way about it all

  of course she cant he steadied
the wheel with one hand and caught
a turn of the main sheet with the other
looking rather anxiously to windward
especially a girl like you

  but why not jack helen be-
stowed herself at his side apparently
quite indifferent to the fact that the
the escape



fleetgas lee deck was awash and the
hoist of the mainsail aback as jack
luffed her slightly when struck by a
puff of superheated air in a hurry to
fill the vacuum which nature abhors
do you mean that i am any different
from other girls

  of course you are youre a baby
so far as knowing anything about tak-
ing care of yourself is concerned ive
met a good many girls but i never met
one like you i guess youre in a class
of yoiir own with no other entries
its a good thing for you that you met
up with a fool like me instead of some
beautiful skunk with high ideals now
lets forget all that and take the wagon
home the way its starting in to blow
were going to have our hands full to
get in there without scraping our paint
and knocking some dents in the local
scenery hang onto the wheel for a
few minutes while i gather in the laun-
dry off the line--

  he threw the yawl up into the wind
and giving the wheel to helen pro-
ceeded to take in sail they were by
this time almost to the mouth of fish-
ers island sound and jack decided not
to wait for nightfall but to go straight
into deep creek under power leave
the yawl in the care of the boatman
from whom he had borrowed the
launch and walk back by the lane to
the sanitarium the weather was
partly responsible for this decision as
the entrance to the little port was nar-
row and rocky and the evening threat-
ened to be thick and with a fresh gale
which was trying to back into the south-
east but the principal reason was that
the sudden change or rather develop-
ment of his feeling for helen made
it infinitely distasteful for him to slip
in with her under cover of the dark-
ness as though there were something to
be ashamed of jack in all of his es-
capades had never been furtive he
was not a back-door person when he
felt that the business wras his own affair
he was a true disciple of lycurgus and
could lie with the brazen assurance of
a spartan youth and like the spartan
youth get his tummy chewed to ribbons
rather than fess up but the same

spirit of noblesse oblige which had com-
pelled him to return helen and serve
out his own sentence now prompted him
to do it openly if only to invite and
challenge reproach offering his cartel
and defiance to any or all who might
dare make any unworthy insinuations

  so he furled the sails and started
the motor then resumed his place at
the wheel helen shifting her position
for one not very far removed

  i guess well go straight in said
jack its blowing up pretty hard and
theres no use taking a chance on knock-
ing the bottom out of the box be-
sides if any of those mutts have got
anything to say about this picnic they
can say it to me

  helen apparently caught his mean-
ing she moved a little closer

  i think that you do everything just
right jack she murmured

  well its an easy bet that youre
the only living person who does jack
answered all the same it cheers me
up a heap to have you feel that way
about it im going to make it my par-
ticular business to see that you con-
tinue the movement for the rest of your
life but theres no good talking about
that now

  why not  helen asked it seems
to me just the time to talk about it
it isnt though jack answered
youre my sister

  all the more reason flelen an-
swered she turned and looked at him
and a little smile twisted the middle of
her mouth jack breathing rather hard
stared straight ahead looking for a cer-
tain red buoy do you ever kiss your
sister jack

  sometimes she generally beats me
to it jill is some kisser she can kiss
the judge out of a new car or a pony
or a dress or something without turn-
ing a hair he falls for it every time
helen appeared to reflect

  it must be rather nice to have a
father like that she said my father
kisses me good night but it always
makes me feel as though he were
stamping a letter or signing a check or
something of that sort when my aunt
kisses me i get a creepy feeling down


the popular magazine

my back-the sort you have when a
cat gets on your shoulder

  stand up and look ahead and see if
you aan see a red spar buoy said jack

 helen rose and glanced ahead
theres a red thing sticking up out of
the water just in front of us said she
its a long way qff though

  jack stood up and stared ahead then
sat down again thats it said he
youve got darn good eyes speak-
ing about this kissing stuff didnt your
father ever take you up in his arms
and kiss you as if he really loved you

 no- helen answered

  well then he must be a d- a-

he must be a-a-well i dont know
what some men are made of my
fathers stock isnt selling very high
with me just this moment but when
jill and i were kids we howled with
joy every time he hove in sight he
used to grab vis up and nearly eat us
and he generally had something tucked
away in his pocket-a surprise-a little
doll for jill-she was always strong for
dolls-and a toy pistol or something
like that for me mrs tibbetts who
was mothers nurse and afterward
housekeeper was always giving father
the devil for sneaking us candy and
peanuts and things when i was ten
years old father was my dearest friend
and now that im twenty-three hes my
worst he didnt even come up to the
boozarium to say good-by

  neither did mine helen answered
the chances are that if they had come
and kissed us good-by we wouldnt
have run away

  i didnt want to be kissed said
jack i wanted my honorable dis-
charge theres that darn buoy it
rides almost under with this strong ebb
tide well weve got to duck in and
face the music and if anybody gives
me two cents worth of sass about this
expedition youll see some fireworks
i wish they would it would cheer me
up a heap in about an hour and a
half we have got to say au revoir
helen for a few months youve got
to serve out your sentence and ive
got to serve out mine and after that
- he reached out to grasp her

hand and his own came back without
touching it he got up and inspected
the motor which was running very
smoothly then came back to the wheel
and sat down after that will you
marry me helen  he asked very
quietly because in all of your life
nobody can possibly love you so much
as i can nor need you so much will
you marry me helen when we get out
of this mess

  helen sprang up throwing out her
arms with a gesture which was alle-
goric her hands might have been
filled with fruits

  of course i will jack she cried
i have been loving y-ou and knowing
you while you have been trying to find
out what was happening i knew long
before you did you are mine and i
am yours so now lets turn the boat
around and go away lets go any-
where jack what do we care lets
just go you love me and i love you
ajpd what does all the rest of it matter
its our own lives and they belong to
us i dont want to go back there
jack i wtant you to turn your boat
around-and to keep on going and go-
ing and going and i want you to kiss
me jack and i want to have you keep
on kissing me until i tell you to stop
-but i never shall jack

chapter xiv

check

  the faithful mike rushing out again
to verify the evidence of his stagger-
ing senses met jack and helen at the
door

  holy saints sor gasped mike
and how manny of yez are there
why there appear to be two of us
mike jack answered whats tht
matter with you anyhow you look
rather wild has our loss impaired
your reason

  faith i think it has said the be-
wildered mike there is yourself in-
side talkin wit doctor lawley and
here are you standin here be the door
talkin to me and there is the young
lady under lock and key beyant and
here is her double wit you sure am
i seein things or what
the escape



  both i guess jack answered
im afraid that youve been drinking
in your sleep

  then i have not sor mike an-
swered because i have not shlept since
you beat it from here we have none
of us shlept what wit heatin the coun-
try for miles around but nivir mind
come in sor

  they followed the dazed attendant
into doctor lawleys office where
jack to his surprise discovered jeanne
in consultation with that sorely tried
physician but his presence of mind
did not desert him

  hello jill  said he good after-
noon doctor helen let me present-
your sister doctor lawley let me-
present you to myr wife

  your--what gasped doctor law-
lcy-

  my wife sir we were married
about an hour ago in new london and
started over in a taxi but got a tire
down when almost here so we took
the trolleys i am sorry to have given
you so much trouble but it appeared
to be unavoidable

  doctor lawleyr stared speechlessly at
the pair but jeanne quickly recovered
her poise nothing that jack might
do could ever surprise her very much
while her first glance at helens lovely
glowing face roused all of her warm-
hearted sympathy she stepped to the
bride dropped her hands on her shoul-
ders and kissed her on both cheeks

  my love and congratulations dear
said she then turned to embrace her
brother we came to see you jack
and doctor lawley held us as hostages
here comes christine now

  the dazed miss van volkenen es-
corted by her prim duenna was at that
moment ushered in and made ac-
quainted wtith the situation then doc-
tor lawley who had in some measure
recovered from his shock requested
them to sit down

  well yroure a wonder jack said
he we get some surprises in this
institution but i must say that seeing
it serve as a matrimonial bureau ex-
ceeds the wildest dreams of any dope

ive ever treated here so you are
good and married 

  we are married and good jack
retorted and whom god hath joined
together let no man put asunder
hm mused doctor hawley
that rather complicates the situation
doesnt it r

  of course not said jack on the
contrary it simplifies it and lets us all
out we were coming back anyhow
to serve out our terms when we hap-
pened to hit on this scheme so now
weve come to thank you for your kind-
ness and get our duds and say good-by
we left our boat at new london and
our plan is to start to-morrow for a
little cruise to the eastward

  but hang it all jack protested
doctor lawley how can i let you go
when youre committed to our care for
the next few months 

  that be jiggered jack answered
i consulted a leading lawyer in new
london and he tells me that a person
who is of age can be committed legally
to such an institution as this with the
consent and by the demand of his im-
mediate family well what is more
immediate than your wife or husband
doctor lawley sighed in the case
of you two nothing that i can think
of he answered

  quite so said jack in that case
our further detention here would be
unlawful and subject doctor brinker
to a suit for heavy damages i desire
to remove my wife from the sanitarium
and in the case of any opposition to
this measure i can get a writ of habeas
corpus in about two seconds the law
gives her the same privilege in regard
to my person so if pa brinker tries
to keep us here against our wills he
will find himself defendant in a dam-
age suit for about a million dollars an
hour and one that wont reflect any
great amount of credit on his blooming
boozarium-and thats no idle threat
doctor lawley frowned look
here jack said he i dont care to
have you speak to me like that i rep-
resent doctor brinker and the direc-
tion of this institution and i take that
sort of talk as a direct insult there


the popular magazine

lias been nothing in our treatment of
you here to warrant such an attitude
on your part and if you say another
word in the same strain i shall have
you put in immediate confinement and
mrs oconnor conducted to her for-
mer apartment until such time as the
courts may decide upon the legality of
your case such a suit as you suggest
would naturally be injurious to the san-
itarium but how about mrs oconnor
and yourself-especially yourself-con-
sidering the publicity which was given
to the performance which led your
father to commit you here do you
get me 

  jack thought hard for an instant
then nodded yes he answered i
get you i guess youre right

  then shut up

  all right said jack ill shut
only before i shut id like to apolo-
gize im sorry doctor

  doctor lawley leaned back in his
chir and clasped his hands behind his
head then lets forget it he an-
swered as a matter of fact you
and your wife are as free as air you
can go whenever you like and god

bless you both-he opened a

drawer of his desk and drew out two
slips of paper before you two
bolted said he i sent off a couple of
telegrams one was a wireless to
judge oconnor saying that i consid-
ered your cure to be complete and
strongly recommended your discharge
from the sanitarium as in my profes-
sional opinion further detention here
would do you more harm than good
the other one was to mr castellane
in san francisco and worded to the
same effect i got answers from the
two of your parents about an hour ago
your fathers reads wireless re-
ceived rely entirely upon your judg-
ment discharge my son frpm sani-
tarium whenever you see fit the other
from mr castellane reads accept
your decision in regard to my daugh-
ter am wiring her aunt to go to sani-
tarium for her 

  jack stared at him with the expres-
sion of a neophyte hanging on the rare
and sacred words of his yogi and some-

thing of the same look was reflected
from the face of his twin sister except
that in her case there was depicted a
certain glow which could scarcely be
described as one of unmixed venera-
tion neither were the impulsive words
which came spontaneously from her
lips precisely those with which a chelah
would address his lama

  i think you are a dear said she
and that this crowd ought to go and
hold its head under the village pump

  two hours later there glided swiftly
out of the estuary of the river thames
from the port of new london con-
necticut united states of america a
thirty-foot w l yawl-rigged motor-
auxiliary launch which was so joy laden
that her plimsoll mark was entirely
submerged it is doubtful if at that
moment the largest ocean-going steam
yacht in those waters was so heavily
burdened with the same cargo

  off goshen point the fresh south-
east gale romped down to greet the
fleetga- with the boisterous gayety of
a drunken wedding guest but jack
was prepared for this glad demonstra-
tion and had the fleetga reefed to
short skirts and high shoes helen was
similarly reefed for this jaunt across
the sound in the teeth of a brewing
gale the motor was reposing itself
and the little yawl under the power of
sail alone which is to say propelled by
grace of the high gods tore great rents
in the surface of the sound which the
high gods mended immediately

  in the shallow cockpit helen was
crowded so closely against jack as to
impair his handling of the wheel but
he did not mind the wheels of boats
and buggies and motoi cars and things
sometimes have to take a certain re-
sponsibility of their own and they usu-
ally manage it somehow this swe-
dish girl of a yacht named fleetga now
took charge and to judge from her
behavior as good as said to jack
carry on lad dont bother about me
im watching my steps

  so they swam out through the wind-
washed dusk and presently the lights
began to prick out here and there the
night was hot and close and their wake
the escape



flamed with phosphorescent sparks
which swirled and eddied in the surges
rolling through the race sprays swept
over them from time to time but they
were soft and briny and refreshing

  where are we going jack helen
asked crowding closely against her hus-
band of so few hours

  his arm passed under hers and drew
her down against him so that her head
fell in precisely the proper position for
ihat of a bride in doubt as to direction

  we are going to the magic isle
he answered and on thechart its name
is shelter and there is a very large
hotel there perhaps they might give
us a nights lodging if i talk to them
politely

  what are all those lights jack 
am i in your way 

  you are and it is my earnest prayer
that you shall be in my way for the
rest of our lives those lights are
from a tow--coal barges with the tug
out there ahead and it is not consid-
ered polite to cross them any more
than it is to cut through a funeral pro-
cession only in this case the punish-
ment for the sacrilege might come
quicker so well just chuck her up for
a minute and watch the procession go

     - 

past

  he hauled on the wind and the
iiectga quite understanding the situa-
tion waited until the long and sluggish
tow had passed then fled off on her
way again in the deeply gathering dusk
in fact it is doubtful if at this moment
jack was running the boat as much
as the boat wtas running jack per-
haps they were working together for
the all good helen assisting at times
the fresh wind had developed a gale
and as they ripped their wav past gull
island they got thoroughly drenched
but they did not mind

  then through the rip the sea
smoothed and they stole quietly up and
anchored off the big hotel jack blew
his boat whistle and presently a launch
came whipping out jack saw it com-
ing and turned to helen

  here we are darling he said i
want to kiss you before the launch gets
here

  then kiss me jack why havent
you kissed me before why jack--
because you werent all mine i
wasnt going to kiss you and all that
stuff and get us both upset in that
boozorium it would have been bad
for you and id have gone amok or
dementado or whatever they call it

  he demonstrated what he meant

chapter xv

twenty months after

  you look very nice in uniform
said jeanne surveying her visitor criti-
cally

  thank you i wish i feltthat way
doctor lawley answered after loose
white hospital clothes this pseudo-khaki
is stiff and hot and it fits me too well
so you are really going said
jeanne

  yes ive just been promised a bil-
let with the first expeditionary force
to france chucked the sanitarium for
good

  do you think that was wise you
had a splendid position there and it was
only a question of time before you
would have been at the head of the
whole institution and one day you
might have owned it

  do you think id stick on there
nursing rummies at a time like this
jeanne  he asked thats good
enough in time of peace when we at-
tach undue value to any kind of a
human life no matter how worthless
but in time of war when the very best
are being sacrificed to duty and ideals
the rummy isnt worth consideration
let em get their jimjams and d ts
and go back to the melting pot and
the sooner the better for all concerncd
we medicos have got better and bigger
work cut out for us than to listen to
dissertations on the fauna of the tween
worlds-pink rabbits and blood-red
mice and horse-headed bipeds and fifty-
seven varieties of reptilia besides we
really dont work many cures theres
only one person that can cure a drunk-
ard and thats the drunkard himself
but the doctor has got to think of
himself a little jeanne protested just


the popular magazine

to hear what he would say and such
a sanitarium as doctor brinkers must
pay enormously

  it has paid good dividends in the
past doctor lawley answered but
as a business enterprise the death knell
has sounded for all such institutions
it is only a question of time before this
entire land of the free becomes really
emancipated from the rule of john
barleycorn or to be more exact his
tithes then good-by sanitarium
when alcohol is burned only in lamps
to heat babys pap the drug habit will
curl up its toes and quit likewise and
to my way of thinking that day is very
near there are a lot of chronic alco-
holics a fair sprinkling of them secret
and unsuspected ones who will suffer
from the shortage and it is probable
that a good many of these will go flop
when the prop is kicked out from
under so much the better with all
the fine men destined to lose their lives
in the defense of humanity nobody is
going to cry himself to sleep over the
passing of the rummy and the dope
then with our ironbound booze laws
and strict drug dispensing we can start
fresh and get a clean sane stalwart
race

  you almost make me forget what
i came to say he observed when

i	get started on this booze talk it car-
ries me away as a matter of fact i
came here with the intention of trying
to carry you away

  he shot these last words out so force-
fully that jeannes high color faded
and she was not easily shocked

  carry me away- she faltered

  yes but not to europe so you
neednt look so scared he stopped
in front of her leaned down and
caught both of her hands in his i
want you jeanne i wrant you to marry
me when i come back theres no use
in my trying to tell you how much i
love you because in the first place i
couldnt and in the second you must
feel it yourself-just as i can feel that
you care for me will you wait for
me sweetheart

  jeanne shook her head she seemed

unable to speak doctor lawley loosed
her hands and stood up as stiffly as
though the military instinct had envel-
oped him with his uniform

  why not  he asked curtly

  jeannes face was pale and she
looked rather frightened but a little
smile struggled at the corners of her
mouth she rose and faced him drop-
ping both hands on his big shoulders

  ill not wait because-because i am
going writh you doctor mine she an-
swered

  doctor lawleys arms shot out and
drew her closer his stern features
relaxed and there was a sort of boyish
joyfulness in his smile but he shook
his head

  no that cant be done darling girl
said he

  it can though there wras a look
of malice in jeannes gray eyes

  all the same im going

  no youre not

  yesi am

  but youre not

  i am though ill bet you six
months pay that i go with you-
whether as your wife or not depends
on you

  ill take the bet now tell me how
youre going to manage it

  jeannes piquant face was now
frankly and mockingly malicious her
white even teeth flashed like those of
some wild woodsy thing

  its already managed she an-
swered i saw this thing coming more
than a year ago and ive taken my
course and got my diploma and lobbied
and boot-licked and wire-pulled the red
cross people until ive got myself listed
to go with the very first expeditionary
force-so theres your six months pay
blown in already doctor mine and let
us hope that this will teach you not
to make blind bets nor to-

  but this was as far as she got as
the strong arms drew her closer and
closer and closer until she gasped for
air while her respiration was still fur-
ther impeded by an obstruction which
made her quite forget the necessity of
breathing at all
 wheatleys fine little motor

by everett rhodes castle

there were just three things in jerry wheatleys life-his wife the plant and his
bus in the order named to all three of them he went to school learning
lessons of ideal and practical value and his wife plus his bus taught him the great
secret for his plant otherwise called the clayton stove company incorporated

there were three things that
heralded the arrival of the
breadwinner at the wheatley
residence in elk street at five-
nineteen first a long bleating that be-
gan in second avenue and ended like
an overworked banshee just after the
turn into elk street second a series
of little bleats directly in front of num-
ber seventeen third the voice of the
breadwinner a voice intended by na-
ture for vast purple distances or
stormy nights at sea inquiring in the
general direction of the kitchen the
inquiry was always the same o-oo-
oh  em-i-lee  want anything from
the store if the answer was nega-
tive-or not at all jerry wtheatley
pulled down the gas shut off the igni-
tion an let er die elk street the
portion of it that used the second street
car line called it the death rattle but
then of course they used the car line

  the breadwinners progress during
the next minute was announced by a
series of different noises all denoting
a certain amount of advancement
there was the relieved sigh of the left
rear spring which was followed by a
tiny treble of protest from the right
rear spring as it flexed under a quick
shifting of weight then a dull thud
 the sod beside the curb immediately
followed by an echolike slam of metal
a moment later three dull thuds one
for each step then another sam this
of wood a mighty ha-loo usually
followed by a delighted gurgle and a
tiny smack after all this mr jerry
wheatley was readv for what he joy-
ously termed the ol feed bag

  b p

  the rule of three also applied to the
interests in young mr wheatleys big
life they were in order of impor-
tance the wife the plant the bus
each received the maximum of return
on the yearly budget of twenty-four
hundred dollars it was characteristic
of him that after deciding a thing was
worth while he gave it all there was
in him of -care of love of work

  take mrs jerry wheatley nee em-
ily beeley emily had been a stenogra-
pher in the sales department of the
plant for nearly two weeks when the
second assistant sales manager noted
with a sense of keen approval that it
was not necessary to wait three seconds
while she shifted a cud of gum in
quick succession he noted other pleas-
ing and worth-avhile qualities for in-
stance he found that he could dictate
to the girl direct mr wheatley was
a modest young man and he hatedto
have to hide his hot blushes from some
unblushlngly thin crepe de chine be-
sides dictating in the general direction
of the ceiling ventilator often changed
cursory to cursing and plastic
conditions to plaster conditions-or
that was what the owner of the un-
blushing crepe de chine had said a
month later emily said that she liked
big strong men who wore soft collars
and scattered pipe ashes that settled
the matter

  then there was the plant every-
body called it the plant though the
office stationery said it was the clay-
ton stove company incorporated
manufacturers of coal and combina-
tion stoves jerry wheatly had gone


the popular magazine

to the plant from high school pos-
sessed of one hundred and ninety
pounds of firm flesh and a nice taste
in neckwear during the knitted-tie
period jerry progressed from filing
clerk to fifth assistant sales manager
which gave him complete authority to
tell the office boy to clean out the letter
trays during the time any self-re-
specting young man in any society at
all was compelled to wear tiny knotted
ties under large close-fitting collars
jerry spent two mornings each week in
the plant itself besides caring for the
routine of his office work with the
first rush of large open-end flowered
four-in-hands jerry became third as-
sistant in consequence of the departure
of the sales manager and his first as-
sistant it was the usual two-year pro-
motion for nearly thirty years it had
been going on when the sales man-
ager left the first assistant was ap-
pointed by old henry bleeker he was
given a two-year contract and told to
go out and make some money for the
company at the end of two years he
departed and his first assistant was
given the same contract and the same
instructions

  when jerry became first assistant
the necktie world was celebrating new
art with a wide assortment of colors
among which black blue and quiet
grays were not it was hard to pass
them by but at twenty-seven a fellow
has to be conservative when hes got
an executive position that will probably
open up at the end of the two-year
period in september fmilv agreed to
the wisdom of this reasoning

  besides jerry she added they
look like an attack of col-larv mor-
bus

  but to this jerry would not sub-
scribe they got class just the same
ol dear he sighed and if i wasnt
due for the big show believe me id
have half a dozen vou need some-
thing to brighten up these pepper-and-
salt executive suits

  but new art neckwear simmonds
job good feeds and the other things
that held the wheatley interest went
into die limbo of neglect when the little

bus arrived it was a vermilion day
that made other red-letter days seem
drab in comparison driving it down
elk street from the f o b its shin-
ing body and steady put-put endeared
itself as no scarf ever could-even back
in the early days passing the elks
club jerry stepped on the accelerator
and whizzed by at twenty miles an hour
just to show the boys at the cigar stand
that he really was an old-timer any
misgiving he might have had at disturb-
ing part of the account over at the first
national vanished in the joyous whoop
as he drew up in front of emily re-
turning from the store

  after the first long sunday-morning
ride into the country it was perfectly
plain that all that was necessary to
complete the wheatley happiness on
this earth was a set of demountable
rims an extra tire mounted in this
fashion meant more time to skim over
bending dipping country roads then
because after all they really were be-
ginners they didnt appreciate just how
enormously a shining nickel-plated
bumper added to the car made it look
longer-almost like a six-cylinder this
was of course corrected after they
became veterans of two sunday tours
and a trip to coryopolis

  it certainly was a wonderful little
motor car why it was as efficient and
economical to operate as a bleeker
range  every sunday morning it was
washed with pure running water-
merely rubbing the dust off was not
for such a fine little boat as this jerry
said afterward the grease cups were
fed and the speedometer turned back so
that the afternoons run might be en-
tered into the little ledger that was to
show the tire mileage and gasoline con-
sumption

  during the first two weeks many in
the sales department were inclined to
scoff because the wheatley knees
showed like two dark ridges above the
artistic stream-line body

  you guys talkin about six-thou-
sand-dollar motors and riding on street
cars make me laugh he told them
can a six-thousand-dollar motor go
any farther take you anywhere i cant
wheatleys fine little motor



follow can it can it take you
twenty-five miles on a gallon can it
can it go up any hill i cant follow
sure theyre bigger an ride a little
easier-not so very much though-but
are they any more efficient  are
they 

  and then just to prove that they
were only kidding and that there were
no hard feelings all agreed to ride home
with him each night

  one sunday jerry had simmonds
and his faded little wife complete the
party it was designed to help brighten
the thin mans tired eyes september
was two months away but the entire
office knew that it stood before him a
quickly speeding milestone that was to
send him out with the many many
others jerry tried hard to drive it
away but in scenery bumpers mileage
and oil consumption simmonds was
only politely interested suddenly it
occurred to jerry that two years hence
he would be that way-afraid he
would join the has-been army of sales
managers that had striven to live up to
that curtly worded contract

  speeding through the country he
spoke of the thing for the first time
he tried to speak jauntily as if there
was no cause for alarm

   looks like the biggest year the plant
ever had he said

  simmonds smiled with his lips but
his thin hand clenched the shiny side
and his reply was tinged with bitter-
ness

  yes he agreed slowly it does
it actually looks as if we are going
to break even

   ii	is assistant opened his recently
added muffler-that the rear seat might
not hear-and slowed down

   but thats a whole lot considering
many of the other years it shows
lhat vou are entitled to another chance
to------

   my contract reads profit  sim-
inonds interrupted wearily and i-i
havent been able to show them

  but you have---

   jerry they didnt put any buts into
it im through in september and then
its up to you

  for several minutes the mild blue
wheatley eyes searched the road ahead
for some reassuring answer of
course everybody knew simmonds had
enough to care for his family but it
was hard no buts simmonds had
been a good sales manager-had given
to the men on the road something of a
fighting spirit that never before had
characterized bleeker sales methods
his men had really sold stoves down
in his heart wheatley knew that he
could do nothing to make them sell any
more in two years he would be
through turning over the heritage of
failure to west of course there were
some things he could improve-but the
big leaks the big mistakes-where
were they  he repeated his unspoken
question aloud

  mr simmonds i have been with
the plant ever since i quit school i
know bleeker stoves from fire box to
flue i know like everybody else in
the trade that bleeker stoves are the
best that can be made i know they
are well liked by every woman that
owns one i am as proud as punch
to think that i am with a company
that for thirty years have been building
the best stove that can be made re-
gardless of price i knowr that the
product has every essential necessary
for success gosh but i wish i knew
what was wrong

  the elder man seemed to wince from
the exclamation but his reply was
equally fervid

  gosh he said slowly so do i

  two months later wheatleys fine
little motor turned from second ave-
nue into elk street without a single
preliminary bleat in front of num-
ber seventeen there were no little bleats
there was no o-oo-oh em-i-lee  no
bang no thud no creak closing the
door quietly he passed through to the
kitchen and faced emily over a huge
kettle of simmering peaches

 they-they fired simmonds to-
day he whispered

  emily tightened her grip about the
wooden spoon

 you-you were-


the cpocpulacr magazine

  young mr wheatley nodded with
his head bent

  yes they gave me the job and the
contract

  it-its like all the rest
  yes

  two years

  a quick duck of the big blond head
  with the profit clause 

  another duck

  mrs wheatley- quietlv let the spoon
slip into the kettle and walked around
the shining bleeker range standing
on tiptoe she managed to crook her
arm about his neck

  youre going out and win arent
you jerry

  im going to try like blazes but look
at simmonds an luce an hamilton

they all tried and-

 yes but they-

 they were good men-darn good
men-and they tried just as hard as
they knew how so will i but--but
im afraid

  but youre not going to be licked
before you start are you you are
not going to quit jut because other
men have failed-are you lerrv
no-o but-

  with wifely intuition mrs wheatley
saw that a stimulant of some sort was
necessary something to bring her big
bov out of this temporary slough she
knew what it was

 how is the car running she
asked

  slowly the huge shoulders of the new
sales manager of the bleeker stove
straightened and enthusiasm warmed
his eyes and turned up the mouth
boyishly he caught her elbows and
lifted her to his eye level when he
spoke it was more like the assistant
sales manager

  not a miss  not a miss  think of
it ol dear thirteen hundred miles so
far an not a miss aint it wonder-
ful honestlv that little boat has so
much pep that it wants to start in
high

  isnt it-

  why they talk about all these ten-
thousand-dollar babies why there
isnt any one of them that could do

any better than that think of it
emily thirteen hundred miles and not
a single solitary little miss thirteen
hundred miles and only lifting up the
hood to give her oil by gosh those
little busses are the bleekers in the auto-
mobile business then as if the
name had brought with it something
far more crushing than the remem-
brance of a promotion he turned and
walked slowly into the dining room
alert to all the little quirks of her for-
mer boss emily knew that there was
something else-something far more
serious when he rumpled his hair
and filled his pipe before dinner she
knew that some extraordinary crisis
was at hand

  a few moments later she followed
him in there he sat in the sagging
armchair that had followed him lov-
ingly through bachelorhood with the
last bit of elk street twilight playing
about his rumpled dejected head
after all he was nothing but a great
big blond boy who was sadly troubled
a moment later she was seated  the
decrepit bursting arm patting his
shoulder stroking his hair he did not
settle back with a mountainous sigh of
content certainly something perfectly
dreadful had happened maybe-

  jerry-what is the matter plead-
ingly

  puff puff

  please caressingly

  puff puff

  a tiny sob brought more fruitful re-
sults then like a man who has some-
thing most distressing to say and wants
to say it in the least words-in the
easiest way

  emily we gotta sell the little bus
he might have been saying emily
we gotta sell the little boy

  behind a huge cloud of light-gray
smoke she smiled what funny things
men were-but then it did mean a lot
to jerrv

  why softly

  because every department head
must have an interest in the business 
must buy two thousand dollars worth
of stock which is repurchased if he
leaves one-fifth is down the rest
wheatleys fine little motor



distributed over two years of course
we got the four hundred in the bank
and the new job pays five thousand
hut im afraid to take any money from
the hank -now so i guess the little
bus without a miss will have to go
but jerry you get so much pleasure

from it both of us and-

  i know dejectedly

  and there isnt the particle of a
doubt in my mind that you are going
to upset that foolish old two-year
hoodoo and make good not a par-
ticle 

  but the chances are too-

  the bigger they are the harder they
fall she quoted

  but fighting bobs optimism failed
to make an impression

  you know emily i wouldnt do it
if i felt that it wasnt absolutely nec-
essary you know that i wouldnt give
up a little boat that never missed-
even on mountain hill-if i just didnt
feel that a sacrifice was necessary
but how about me  ill miss those

little trips-

  amiable jerry stopped the temptress
with as grim a tone as he could mus-
ter you go into the kitchen and tend
to your burning peaches he directed
and ill write an ad for the coryopolis
papers

  not because his mouth was trying
so hard to be grim or because his tone
was trying so hard to be commanding
but because the pcaches really might
be burning she obeyed

  looking through the door a few mo-
ments later she saw him busy with a
pad upon his knee battling silently

  twenty minutes later peaches shin-
ing through glistening glass she stole
lack to his side he was reading what
he bad written softly as if to himself
after each sentence he stopped and
uttered a low fervid gosh when
he noticed her he said nothing but
handed her the paper holding it close
to the dying light without she read

for sale-automobile

  here is the finest little car that ever
climbcd mountain hill on high

  it yields twenty-five long happy miles to
the gallon---

  it gives five hundred miles of beautiful
sccnery and pure air to one gallon of oil

  it possesses a motor without a miss-

  it has a body without a scratch-

  and the owner is only selling it because he
absolutely has to	box-

  why its perfectly wonderful she
thrilled why you wont have a bit
of trouble selling it after any one reads
that

  he was smiling now as he reached
forward to grasp her hands thats
the funny part of it he chuckled a
boy again i wrote it so convincingly
and so enticingly that i sold it to my-
self gosh emily isnt it funny i
didnt really realize how good it was
till i sat down and wrote about it
and youre not going to sell it
sure i am but to myself

  and youre not going to be discour-
aged-about-about the job

  nope

  after dinner he suddenly dropped
the evening paper to his knees his
eyes opened wide he whistled four
flat notes of incredible wonder a mo-
ment later with the wrinkled advertise-
ment he had written in his hand he
was comparing it to a young lady in
white apron and cap who smiled from
a womans magazine the young lady
wras gracefully dangling a beautifully
manicured hand over a highly polished
stcjve underneath in pleasing italics
that might well indicate a polished tone
were the words

  i think bleeker ranges are won-
derful-dont you

  for the space of three stitches on
emilys flying needles he gazed from
wrinkled paper to graceful lady he
opened his mouth only to close it a
moment later without having uttered
a sound once more he essayed to tell
the world but all that came was a won-
dering almost unbelieving gosh

ii

 when henry bleeker was but the
proprietor of a small hardware store
he had a dream-and a back room
this was many years before the big
chance came it was simple but then
many people in clayton said henry was
simple


the popular magazine

  henry wanted to build the best stove
in the country-that and own a pair
of fierce stiff-legged iron dogs for the
front lawn he carried a full line of
stoves in the front of the store and
built his dream in the little room it
was too bad it often hurt sales but
it eased henrys conscience somewhat
when he was directly asked for his
opinion we-e-el its as good a stove
as they make in these days-anyhow
in the little back room he had worked
out many ideas that only needed money
to prove their absolute soundness but
then henry rarely spoke of this

  and then one bright spring morning
henry awoke to the astounding fact
that he had more money than there
was in the world-pretty near anyhow
who would have ever thought that
tom bleeker could make two hundred
thousand dollars let alone save it
not henry at any rate but it was
so henry bought the iron dogs to
guard his modest cottage for one hun-
dred and twenty-five dollars and that
left one hundred and ninety-nine thou-
sand eight hundred and seventy-five
dollars to build the best range that could
be made

  two years later the bleeker range
went onto the market it used cast iron
in place of sheet steel to guard against
the tiny pin holes that appeared in the
sheet steel it cost more money was
harder to handle from a manufacturing
point of view but henry was building
a dream

  the next year the bleeker double
fire box made its appearance and the
bleeker patented adjustable fue both
were improvements and helped sell
ranges the clayton stove company
lost only eight thousand dollars that
year and henry was rather proud

 the third year production had
reached the point where henry felt
that a sales manager was a necessary
evil and hired charles buyer of the
clayton news-sentinel to come in and
act in that capacity another thing
that hastened his coming at this time
was the fact that the bleeker baking
equalizer needed explaining to the
trade henry explained the situation

when he handed charlie the two-year
contract

  well make the finest range that
money can buy-build it as economi-
cally as a good range can be built
we do our part now its up to you
to do yours

  there was a slight delay however
before charlie could get started be-
cause just as the model was ready
henry working in his little private
workroom behind the general office
perfected an automatic coal feeder that
everyr woman who had used a coal
scuttle would go wild over charlie
said it was a pip and ought to go
big it did at the end of the two-
year period there had been three
bleeker ranges sold to one for the pre-
vious years the loss was only some-
thing like two thousand dollars but
charlies contract was not renewed

  his successor was sure he could live
up to henrys requirements inasmuch
as his six months experience as first
assistant had filled him with the bleeker
spirit-the pride of putting worth be-
fore profit to this henry replied that
he was very glad that bleeker men
to a man were just as enthusiastic over
the range as he

  and just to prove what a really live
organization is constantly working to
improve this ideal of ours henry
added we have another new conveni-
ence ready for the new model

  but the coal feeder 

  that is already a huge success of

course---

 but i thought-

  but previous successes were ashes in
the mouth of henry

 onward always onward he
barked we cannot be content with
past successes now the new bleeker
device for grilling-his eyes fairly
danced with the joy of achievement-
is simply going to corral all the stove
business in this section

  fine great his new sales man-
ager shouted his enthusiasm over this
fresh triumph of bleeker inventiveness
getting the better of his first-assistant
conservatism

  the road men were equally enthusi-
wheatleys fine little motor



astic and went out and sold bleeker
ranges in many sections where compe-
tition had reigned supreme but sep-
tember two years later found his en-
thusiasm sans profits

  hamilton who took his place was
backed by two years in the heart of the
plant two years spent with henry
trying always trying to make the
bleeker a better range he had the
added advantage of the new bleeker
combination coal and gas range and
sold all the ranges that a loving fac-
tory could turn out everybody was
sorry to see hamilton go but the
bleeker policy was amendable to no
report that began with the word defi-
cit

  then henry added two assistant
sales managers of course the new
head was a bright progressive man
full of the bleeker spirit but then so
had been hamilton it was best to
be prepared during this regime henry
added his patented easy-lift lids
they were a good talking point every
one agreed but at the end of the con-
tract period there were no profits dis-
cernible to the naked eye but this par-
ticular sales manager refused to take
defeat so easily he fought for his
position with the same grimness of pur-
pose and mouth that he had fought for
more and more business he prepared
a large sheet of figures and then asked
henry and the factory manager to step
in

  during my two years he said
quietly we sold up to the capacity of
the factory	

  henry-they had started to call him
affectionately ol henry a year be-
fore-pursed his lips and folded his
arms and indicated thereby that this
was an old argument

  the sales managers face reddened
and he thrust a clenched fist into the
astonished bleeker oountenance

  you are charging me with your
loss he shouted it isnt fair to
refuse me a contract when my depart-
ment has sold the product enlarge
your plant cut down yoiir overhead 

 but-

  i could go on selling a million

bleeker ranges and we still wouldnt
make a cent either cut down your
production costs increase your volume
or raise the price of your product
these are the only ways out and i

  ol henry held up a commanding
thin white hand when the sales man-
ager had controlled himself by grasp-
ing the chair arms till the knuckles
showed white he spoke

 you are doubtless he began
slowly as if striving to be fair in-
clined to the belief you mention be-
cause you are excited a-hem let
meexplain sir that i have been manu-
facturing stoves for twenty years-that
i dreamed of them ten years before
that that i have never stopped im-
proving adding some device to im-
prove what mechanically was at the
very beginning the best most economi-
cal range built no sir youre
wrong we are manufacturing at as
low a cost as possible

 but then-

  further we will not increase the
price of our product until such times
as the rising costs of raw material com-
pel it bleeker ranges sir are not a
commercial venture in the strict sense
of the word they are too good they
are through this company an institu-
tion of course we expect profits and
i must say that the mistake lies in your
-ahem-former department

  but the next year under the luce
reign in the sales department the pro-
duction of bleeker ranges was in-
creased fifty per cent in addition
preparations were being made for an-
other increase of fifty per cent the year
following everybody said luce wras
a lucky chap especially as he had the
new automatic gas adjuster just per-
fected for bleeker ranges to add to
his already bright prospects but it
proved a disastrous two-y-ear period
the automatic gas adjuster was placed
too close to the bleeker baking equal-
izer and many women through differ-
ent jobbers made vigorous complaints
each was cheerfully adjusted but a
very large barrel would have have held
the deficit and then came simmonds


the popular magazine

  and then came jerry

  afire with the inspiration from the
great little bus he could only fidget
until bieeker arrived both seemed
to have news for the other

  i have the big idea said jerry

  i have a new damper shrilled the
boss

  our advertising has been done out-
side the plant by men-good men-but
men who do not love and know the
product as we do it has been clever
and catchy but weve been playing up
pretty girls and not the economy and
inherent goodness of bleeker ranges
we gotta have more punch more
knowledge of the product more sin-
cerity 

  his employers face seemed to fairly
radiate appreciation of this great dis-
covery wonderful splendid  he
complimented i knew the fault didnt
lie in the stove or its manufacture
but as i was saying this new damper
which should be ready in six months
will-

  six months later the new idea in ad-
vertising was selling bleeker stoves in
great shape but a special report for
the same period showed the same old
story despite doubled capacity ca-
pacity sales but no profits 

  the next day the new model was
to be up for discussion before produc-
tion was started it was a great little
thing this new bleeker damper
clever but jerry was afraid

  six still found him at his desk star-
ing through the window with eyes that
missed the foundry beyond he was
in the same rut as simmonds for a
moment he buried his huge blond head
in the crook of a huge blond arm the
other fingers clutching went feeling
into space a moment later he was
looking at a glaring yellow sheet that
his fingers had found among the pile
of late mail 

  buy a pilster sav-a-gas save twenty pet
cent of your gas bills no more carbon easier
starting tool only 

  the little bus without a miss cer-
tainly deserved one if that was so but
- damn

iii

  that night emily had boiled ham and
spinach for her great big successful
boy and just for fun demi-tasse in-
stead of the larger cups

  is my big boy tired she cooed
over the last hasty sip from the third
cup he had such an appetite

  jerry thinking of the little yellow
slip that nestled within his coat pockct
said kinda instead of his usual
fulla pep ol dear

  then a moment later 

  she passed the two-thousand mark
to-day two thousand miles without
a single solitary miss

  but suppose we had been able to go
four hundred extra miles on the same
amount of gasoline at twenty-two
cents a gallon we would have saved
just about three dollars and a half it
would be worth saving wouldnt it
emilv 

 yes but-no longer was there
a coo

  and then if we had been able to
eliminate all the carbon--

  and made the starting easier and
    

  tell me how- suspiciously

  of course you gotta remember that
the elimination of  all these things
lengthens the life of the car and con-
sequently-

  how much is it she said as one
listening to some old old story

  only thirty-five dollars- non-
chalantly

 oh jerry-

  of course hastily we dont have
to get one but heres the idea it fits
over the manifold like this see his
forefinger pointed out the arrangement
and it regulates the flow of the gas

and-

 but- 

  with a rigid forefinger she stopped
him

  you are spending thirty-five dollars
to save three dollars and a half she
accused

  let me show you something i fig-
vred out just the other day and then
let me ask you just one question will
you dear
wheatleys fine little moto



  sure amusedly

  in a moment she was over to her
spindly little desk and back in her hand
was a small sheet of paper silently
she gave it to him slowly he read it
aloud

one jazz automobile 

one bumper nickel-plated 

one set demountable rims-

one set larger tires for rims less

  discount for other tires 

one spotlight 

extra tire and carrier 

seat covers 

total 

extras  

  well  still amusedly

  she was standing before him in what
he had come to know was the charac-
teristic beeley attitude for earnestness

  jerry did that extra one hundred
and seventy-two dollars make our won-
derful little car run one bit better 
ten minutes later like a man grasp-
ing at the one solid shaft among a
general tumbling of idols he spoke
but emily you do use the bleeker
baking equalizer dont you 

  she wanted to please him but-

  sometimes

  not-not always

  it wasnt fair to quibble with ones
husband

  no whispering mostly i do like
all women who bake

  hows that bravely

 use-a-straw

  the face of the sales manager of
the clayton stove company incorpo-
rated was a curious mixture of pain
and joy his exclamation showed the
death-stirring significance

  gosh he whispered to the soft
dark-brown head that rested to the left
of the third frog of his smoking jacket

iv

  grouped about the big oak table in
the private office of henry bleeker
were the four high priests of the
bleeker dynasty ol henry murchi-
son the factory and production head
hildreth the advertising manager who
had come out of the factory end to

  write about the thing he knew and
loved lastly and but recently ar-
rived is our hero

  it had been a happy enthusiastic
group before mr wheatley arrived
loaded breast-high with books and ledg-
ers it had been an optimistic group
for the new bleeker damper looked like
a winner

  the reading of the minutes of the
preceding meeting are of no interest
beyond the fact that through the en-
tire reading the sales manager was very
busy arranging ledgers and a number
of large sheets covered with closely
typed figures nobody was curious
about these however every one knew
that they were the production reports
of the most efficient little factory in
the world ol henry opened the dis-
cussion

  now then gentlemen he chirped
the new model first-

  and then jerry faced them from his
paper-laden trenches ol henry pursed
his lips in silent disapproval jerry
wras nervous almost shaky it seemed
to the others but his first wrords nearly
blotted out his great effort

  gentlemen i own a little five-hun-
dred-dollar jazz he said it quietly
with calm dignity

  oh-hum  yawned hildreth

  hell exploded murchison lets
talk business

  that is just what i propose to do

  how many miles without a miss
now jerry indulgently from hil-
dreth

  oh boy these jazz nuts to the
ceiling from murchison

  even ol henry a slight dry smile

  jerry grinned with them it was
better

  laugh all you want to but that little
ol boat has solved a problem that we
have worked on for thirty years and
failed

  a gas range without a miss yes 

  maybe said murchison he got
the idea from having his radiator al-
ways look as if there was something
cooking in it

  every one laughed

that is gross libel he told them


the popular magazine

after the last chuckle had died but
let it pass i am really serious heres
the idea i spent one hundred and
seventy-two dollars in the last eight
months putting extra equipment on the
car i spent it because i was too en-
thusiastic i thought a lot of people
outside the jazz organization knew just
as much about the jazz car and what
they needed as any one gentlemen
i spent one hundred and seventy-two
dollars without making my car run any
better any cheaper or with any more
satisfaction that is what this com-
pany is up against we were and are
all like that about bleeker stoves

  ol henrys face was alive with
twitching that forecast immediate
squalls and high winds

  we have never had any one in the
organization that didnt think bleeker
ranges were the greatest stoves on earth
-and they are but we loved them too
well in our effort to make them better
we kept adding and improving and all
the improvements were good too in
our enthusiasm we lost our perspec-
tive our production has been effi-
ciently handled-

  a nod of corroboration stayed the
storm

  but each years model was handled
separately every time we added some
improvement we had to change our pat-
terns our designs and if you look at
these figures you will see where some
of the things we have added have cost
us a barrel of money each year with-
out making the bleeker range one bit
more economical to operate our range
of ten years ago baked as well and as
cheaply as to-days model

  the jazz could have many improve-
ments too good ones but each would
mean some change in chassis or en-
gine or production costs that would not
make it worth while we must stand-
ardize the bleeker range is too good

to belong to us alone it is-

  just in time was oil poured on the
fast-rising water of the bleeker wrath
they were words of inspiration

  bleeker ranges are not for us alone
they are a public inspiration

  for several tense seconds the other

  three watched the struggle between the
bleeker vanity and the bleeker inven-
tiveness

  my boy i believe you are right
we are a public institution three
men sighed with deep thankfulness

  on the third of september six
months later two men ran down the
corridor that led to the office of the
sales manager of the clayton stove
company they ran like men who
bore great news-news that men had
waited thirty years to carry through
the door they rushed like boys out
of school in the rear like a school-
maam smilingly deprecating the ex-
uberance of youth came ol henry
they found the hero of it all bent over
a little brown-covered book worried
anxious preoccupied

  hurrah for the jazz shouted
murchison

  hurrah for the little ol boat
chorused hildreth

  we made eighteen hundred dollars
in six months shouted ol henry

  and then they noticed that he paid
no heed that the great news did not
straighten the line over the brows or
lift the curve of the lips when ol
henry patted him on the back he only
nodded absently like the hooligan
triplets they demanded

 whats-

 the matter--

  jerry

  when he spoke it was accusingly but
directed toward himself apparently
he looked solemnly from one to the

other then-

  if i only hadnt tried to be tight

with it-

 but---

  if i only had spent thirty-five dol-
lars and kept out the carbon--
whats happened whos dead
his look seemed to indicate that
death was a trivial matter

she missed she missed coming up

the way of the white man

                by ralph stock

           author of south oj the line etc

         ii-rules of the game

felisi was hoeing in the family
 taro patch when the white man
crawled out of the green cavern
of the bush on to the beach of

luana

  there was blood on his face his
ducks were tattered and besmeared and
his left hand trailed lifelessly in the
sand at his side for a moment he
stared along the stretch of glistening
beach like an owl strayed from its
cranny in the light of day then quite
suddenly he collapsed in a little heap
and lay still

  now the way of the white man is
beyond belief felisi who for many
months had lived among him and his
women while selling imitation pink
coral on the wharf at levuka had
learned this great truth from the bit-
tersweet experience that goes to make
up life-even the life of a south sea
islander she had studied the white
man in his love and in his hate in pros-
perity and poverty peace and war and
at the end of an eventful seventeen
years she found herself no nearer dis-
covering the cause of his ineffable con-
ceit colossal ignorance monumental
selfishness and undoubted greatness
than she had been as a tiny bronze in-
fant playing under the breadfruit trees
of her native village

  wherefore the genus white man
claimed a good deal of felisis atten-
tion his antics interested her in the
same way that her own life and habits
interested some white men though of
course it never occurred to the latter
that while they were studying the
quaint customs of a quaint people
they themselves were being studied

for instance when the dear old gen-
tleman on the wharf at levuka had

patted felisis head and bought a shil-
lings worth of spurious coral for the
sake of studying the texture of her
hair he had not the faintest idea that
the soft brown eyes that wandered lan-
guorously over his superannuated per-
son had noted that tufts of hair grew
out of his ears in a most comical man-
ner that his false teeth moved when
he talked and that save for his red
skin he was the living image of a dod-
dering lunatic that felisi knew of in a
certain village up the coast

  but there it was

  and here was another case a white
man lying in a limp heap on the beach
of luana he was quite young as
white men went and when felisi had
climbed a palm and given him a drink
from a green coconut he sat up with
startling abruptness

  where am i he demanded

  luana felisi answered squatting
in the sand and watching with interest
the contortions of his pink face as he
tried to lift his left arm

  luana-ouch-yes i seem to have
been on luana for the last twenty
years but what part ouch

  senai kebn said felisi

  the white man whistled

  great scott he muttered the
north end i must have-

  but felisi was thinking of this gen-
tleman scott he was so universal and
always so great w ho was he  she
determined to find out at the first op-
portunity at the moment she became
aware that the white man was staring
at her with suddenly awakened inter-
est

  you speak english  he exclaimed
as though this accomplishment of fe-
lisis had just reached his notice


the popular magazine

  some she answered glibly using
the word she had learned on the wharf
at levuka and always found so useful

  thank heaven muttered the
white man

  have you seen any one-a white
man i mean a large white man who
limps when he walks and carries a
rifle under his arm he was looking
over his shoulder now and when he
turned there was a furtive look in his
eyes

  felisi shook her head

  then you soon will snapped the
white man get me out of here kid
somewhere safe and-and you shall
have all ive got hes after me
theyre all after me i havent slept
for three nights the bush-i cant
stand it any more he moaned and
pitched face forward into the sand

  it was an interesting phenomenon
that when the white man is strong and
well he is a god in his own estimation
infinitely removed above the polynesian
race but when he is sick or fright-
ened he is as humble as a child it was
as a child that felisi saw this white
man she knew of a place a perfectly
safe place and when she had brought
him round for the second time she
guided him to it the buli of senai
keba had built a new lookout on the
edge of the beach but the old one
still remained up among the branches
of a giant dilo tree it was a big busi-
ness getting the white man up the
broken ladder of liana and he had no
sooner crawled onto the platform of
woven branches than he collapsed
again

  he was veryr humble

  felisi brought him green coconuts
and cooked taro root and while he ate
in great hungry mouthfuls she exam-
ined bis arm there was a clean hole
on one side just above the elbow and
a rather larger one on the other

  so long as it hasnt got the bone
its nothing mumbled the white man
with his mouth full but i rather fancy
it has ouch he leaned back
against the dilo trunk while felisi
bound the wound with a strip torn from
her sulu it was a good shot he

continued to mumble reminiscently be-
tween munches at the taro root five
hundred yards if it was an inch i
was crawling up the other side of the
valley- the onlyr bit of open country
wed seen for-how long was it-four

-five days- plis voice trailed off

into silence he was asleep asleep
with the half-eaten taro root in a hand
lying limply- palm upward on the plat-
form

  he slept for a day and a night and
nearly half a day and when he awoke
he ate until felisi thought he would
burst fie seemed to swell with the
food just like a buli at a feast his
eyes grew brighter and he was not so
humble he laughed

  weve diddled em kid he said
yawning and stretching luxuriously
this is great

  felisi squatted on the platform and
watched him in silence suddenly his
hand went to his hip pocket and he
drew out a joint of bamboo corked at
one end he extracted the cork with
his teeth and poured out onto the plat-
form a stream of pearls he hummed
a little air as he sat looking at them

  worth a bit of trouble arent they 
he suggested

  felisi nodded though personally she
preferred imitation pink coral it was
easier to come by and more colorful

  and there was trouble he added
reminiscently

  crane didnt play the game by me
partnerships again never did believe
in partnerships but whats a fellow to
do when hes got the will and the
knowledge and the muscle and no dibs
to back em up

  felisi shook her head and looked
sympathetic among her many other
accomplishments she was probably the
best listener in the world pier attitude
appeared to encourage the white man

  such a time  he breathed first
chance ive had of thinking about it or
having a look at them he added roll-
ing the pearls to and fro under his lean
brown fingers first of all in the cut-
ter-you get to hate the way a man
hangs up his hat if youre alone with
the way of the white man

him long enough lord how i came
to hate that man he was mean-
dirty mean in thought and action-and
he was one of your oily sort until some-
thing went wrong then he was peevish
as a sick child and with as much to
back it up you couldnt hit him
you felt you were up against a man-
woman or a woman-man whichever
way you like to put it-worst of both
you know like a half-caste

  me know uni felisi thought fit to
interpolate

  it was after we got to the lagoon
the white man went on after the third
pearl to be exact the whole lot werent
wrorth twenty pounds but we w-ere
gloating over them on the cabin table
crane would pick em up then i would
we were talking some bosh about the
biggest being worth a possible fifty
pounds-fifty pounds when it was as
deformed as a hunchback-but we liked
to talk big it kept our spirits up i
looked at crane suddenly and i saw
his eyes by lamplight they were fas-
tened on me and they hated me they
hated me as much as i hated him but
for a different reason the pearls were
the reason in his case i laughed i
couldnt help it it struck me as so
darned funny-us two sitting in a cabin
twelve feet by ten hating one another

  felisi laughed too it was white
mans joke

  i think crane must have mistaken
my laugh anyway we both knew
what we thought of each other as surely
as though we had spoken it got worse
we did quite well and cranes hate
increased with the quantity and size
of the pearls mine couldnt get any
worse than it had been at the begin-
ning so i was out of the running but
do you suppose we said nasty things
to one another not a bit of it for
sheer politeness you couldnt have
equaled us south of the line it was
an uncommonly good day jim from
crane and good enough from me i
think we can crack a bottle over this
one jim and right-o from me if
we go on like this from crane and
touch wood from me it came to
being polite at meals in the end and i

didnt laugh i must have lost my sense
of humor those days

  felisi nodded her head understand-
ingly the white man might have been
talking to the lady with the gold hair
behind the bar in levuka for all the
difference he seemed to find in his
audience felisi took it as an uncon-
scious compliment which indeed it was

  then came what id been expecting
but id hidden the dinghy oars and
hadnt given him credit for the pluck
of swimming a hundred yards through
sharks he did it its wonderful
what fifty first-grade pearls will do
with a man-woman luckily it was
a mangrove country we were anchored
off and there were three miles of it
before you could get to real solid earth
i tracked him as easily as you would
an elephant and just before nightfall
something approaching white moved on
the other side of a gully i fired and
went over tt was crane lying on his
face with his fat legs sprawled dead
as meat and the pearls were in the
corner of his beastly bandanna hand-
kerchief that hadnt been washed for
months

  the white man sat propped against
the dilo trunk staring out to sea with
a disgusted expression still lingering on
his face presumably at the thought of
the bandanna handkerchief

  felisi neither moved nor spoke she
knew by instinct when to do either
and presently the white man went on
though slower

  its the first man ive killed im
not used to shooting at men much less
killing them but i wasnt sorry it
rather surprised me how i took it when
i found him dead somehow it never
struck me that i couldnt go out into
the world and get on with life as i
had before it seemed to me that i
had rid the world of something dirty
mean and that was all there was to it
the other came later-in the bush and
especially at night when the mist rises
and the tree fungus glows through it
like a lamp in a london fog i came
to know what is it to have killed a man
-even a man-woman-and what it is
to be the pet of a man hunt lord


the popular magazine

he glanced over his shoulder then
laughed nervously its worse than
playing spooks with the lights out
they haunt you all right you think
youve done with them-thrown then
off-hut you havent they bob up again
and come creeping on through the bush
i dont know but i think it must be
hanson thats got my track hes a
good shot-that was a classy shot five
hundred yards and i was moving-the
only man of them worth thinking about
middling tall and chunky with a tooth-
brush mustache youre sure you
havent seen him

  sure mimicked felisi

  i got him though-through the leg
waited behind a lantana bush until he
was on top of me and then hadnt the
pluck to shoct him anywhere but in the
leg im glad i didnt too hes all
right and hes got to do his work its
queer but you positively get to like a
man that sticks to you the wray hes
stuck to me it becomes a sort of
ghastly game with unwritten rules to
it through mangrove swamps and
mazes of underbrush up over volcanic
rock and across rivers writh the worst
sort of shark in them i wras lost prop-
erly lost and i know he was but we
kept on he never left me-day and
night he never-left-me

  the white mans eyes were suddenly
alert and staring fixedly at the reed
brake on the far side of the beach
his voice had dropped then ceased al-
together his jaw hung down out
of the reed brake onto the beach limped
a man with a ride under his arm

  he was a hundred yards away and
looking out to sea but the man up on
the lookout seemed to shrivel into him-
self on the far side of the dilo trunk
felisi was wearing a red hibiscus blos-
som but the white man snatched it out
of her hair

  ssh  lie down  he breathed

  you all right wdiispered felisi re-
assuringly

  he white man seized her roughly
by the wrist and jerked her down be-
side him

  lie there he hissed it is han-
son hows the beach

  beach him all right quavered fe-
lisi looking out through the branches
the white man forced her down to the
platform

  you little fool i mean is it dry
where we came over it-powdery 
will it show the difference-difference
savvy -between a naked foot-your
foot and mine the white man indi-
cated his long-legged boots with a
slight movement

  beach him all right pouted felisi
with the air of one defending her per-
sonal property against unfair aspersion
him no show diffrance

  whats he doing now

  felisi could feel the white mans body
trembling against her own she peeped
out and saw the man on the beach bend-
ing over the disturbance in the sand
where the white man had fallen fe-
lisi was at a loss the very humble
child lying beside her needed soothing

  whats he doing it repeated peev-
ishly

  him go so said felisi drooping
her head writh the pantomimic art of
the meke dancer him very tired
ah  muttered the white man and
smiled grimly

  felisi knew that she wras committed
beyond recall she had taken sides
and she did not regret her choice the
heart of a woman instinctively goes out
to the fugitive fie is the weaker
and when once the polynesian has
taken sides there is no turning back

  presently she had to tell him  him
come close up

  the man on the beach was limping
along its edge peering into the reed
brake he would come directly under
the dilo tree

  the white man at felisis side lay
as still as stone flis jaw was set his
muscles tense felisis hand went out
as stealthily as a snake drew the re-
volver from its holster and placed it
in his hand the white man seemed
not to notice it and still lay motionless
staring into the twisted branches of the
dilo tree but listening-listening with
every nerve to the soft crunch of ap-
proaching footsteps in sand they
ceased directly under the platform
the way of the white man



felisi could hear the beating of her
own heart a minah bird squawked
shrilly in the branches overhead and
she felt her wrist crushed in a vise-
like grip there was the click of an
opening lid a match was struck the
pleasant smell of good tobacco smoke
floatedup to them on the still air then
the footsteps passed on

  wonder he- didnt smell me
grinned the white man its hanson
all right he smokes heraldic her-
aldic in a good air-tight box and a
woody brier he smacked his lips

  why you no shoot  demanded fe-
lisi pouf bang-him finish

  not till im cornered answered the
white man i dont want to kill han-
son hes a good fellow ive got
nothing against him

  felisi scrambled into a squatting po-
sition to think this out her small
bronze face was puckered with bewil-
derment here was one man chasing
another man to catch him and have him
killed yet the pursued had nothing
against the pursuer was there ever
such an amazing state of affairs  a
sort of ghastly game with unwritten
rules to it then there was no need
to make the suggestion that had been
in her mind namely that she should
dispatch the man on the beach herself
in one of the many ways that she had
at her command

  besides the white man went 
with a hint of apology in his tone it
wouldnt make any difference have
you ever heard of the law

  felisi nodded vigorously she hap-
pened to know something about this
thing called law

  well there it is it never stops
the law says that i shall be strung up
by the neck until im dead and han-
son is the law if i kill him another
man takes his place and so on for-
ever the law never stops

  him big fellah law mused felisi
i should just say he is muttered
the white man leaning limply against
the dilo trunk and looking out to sea
with melancholy eyes hes a bad
fellah to bunt up against too but some-
times-sometimes he can be given the

slip look here  he added with sud-
den eagerness hanson may have
gone on and he may not i wouldnt
trust him a yard theres only one
way out of this thing you be fishing
in a canoe-a canoe with a sail in it
mind you-off the beach to-night ill
swim out-all ive got he ended ab-
ruptly

  felisi nodded

  bless you kid said the white man
and fell to collecting the scattered
pearls

  on her way up to the village she met
the law he was sitting on a fallen
palm beside the track that commanded
a view of the beach and the village

  siandra was his cheerful greeting
though his brown face was haggard
with exhaustion

  felisi giggled and squirmed in the
approved fashion of island girls who
have never had the opportunity of
studying white human nature in le-
vuka

  but the law did not smile his
steady gray eyes seemed to burn holes
in felisis face and he spoke sharply
with the air of a man who is used to
receiving prompt answers

  have you seen a white man about
here he demanded in her own tongue

  felisi continued to giggle and shuffle
her feet in the red earth of the track

  answer me  snapped the law

  no sir faltered felisi

  where have you just come from

  the question came so quickly that
the answer was out of felisis mouth
before she could properly form it

  the beach sir

  then why didnt i see you on the
beach just now

  but felisis mind was nimble enough
when it was alert she giggled though
it was an effort with the awful eyes of
the law upon her

  answer me  he boomed

  i was bathing sir she simpered
with long blue-black lashes sweeping
her cheeks

  well what of that

  i hid myself sir

  the law laughed he actually


the popular magazine

laughed though it was a mirthless sort
of sound

  there run along to the village my
girl and tell the buli that breitania
levu wants him here at once and tell
him to send down something to eat and
drink in the meantime

  the village is quite close sug-
gested felisi diffidently and the guest
house is cool a wild scheme flitted
through her mind of launching the
canoe while the law was in the vil-
lage

  thank you he answered and his
eyes resumed the burning process but
i shall stay here

  as felisi turned to go these same
eyes were sweeping the beach they
seemed to see all things

  she felt them at her back as she
swung on toward the village the
law was certainly a big fellah

  not long before sunset felisi was
fishing in the canoe perhaps fifty yards
out from the beach of luana it was
very simple very unexhilarating if
you dropped an old boot on the end of a
string over the side you would catch
something off the beach of luana but
felisis hand trembled as she continued
to land fish after fish the sun kissed
the sea and went to bed and felisi con-
tinued to fish with her eyes on the
shore there was no moon and there
were few stars but there was the vague
half light that never deserts a tropical
night and presently a shadow flitted
across the beach and dissolved into the
sea-but not entirely a still smaller
shadow and round was gliding on the
surface of the water nearer and
nearer it came until it was possible to
see the spreading fan of ripples in its
wake and something on its summit that
gleamed even in the half light

  then the silence of the night was
split asunder by the crack of a rifle
and a bullet plocked into the water a
foot from the moving shadow it van-
ished and silence closed down but
only for a moment it was clear that
the eyes of the law saw all things
the next bullet was nearer and each
time the shadow vanished it was for a
shorter time and there was a shorter

silence felisi strained her eyes into
the darkness and at last there was a
long silence-a very long silence her
clasped hands were pressed down over
her heart and still the silence con-
tinued she held her breath and pres-
ently above the beating of her heart
she heard another rifle shot but farther
away up the beach she paddled
swiftly in its direction and as the canoe
slid gently on the sand shots came
muffled from the bush the shadow
had missed the canoe then and re-
turned to shore

  they were fighting in a palm grove
now-the shadow and the law-still
fighting would it ever cease felisi
wondered as she followed up the sounds
of conflict truly the law never
stops from palm trunk to lantana
bush they flitted the shadow always re-
treating the law always advancing
a tongue of flame would be answered
with a tongue of flame report with re-
port it was an argument in flame and
lead then quite suddenly there fell a
silence-a silence that lasted an uncon-
scionable time and out of it came a
voice in breathless jerks

  whats-the use-lucas 

  and an answering voice replied
thats-my business youd-have
-shot him yourself-hanson

  i dare say but-i must warn you
-that anything you may say-will

  a breathless laugh came from some-
where

  you can get all that-off your chest
--when youve got me

  youre out of ammunition

  dont be too sure you are i
know the government ration and ive
counted

  there was a short silence then--

  whats more ill prove it

  the shadow emerged from behind a
lantana bush evolving into the form
of the white man he stood quite still
out there in the open his white ducks
looming clear against the inky back-
ground of the underbrush the re-
volver was leveled from his hip in the
right hand the other hung inert at
his side
the way of the white man



  now he said will you let me go
without killing you ilanson i dont
want to

  let you go  snapped the voice of
the law and a glint of white showed
behind a palm trunk not forty paces
distant

  dont come out cried the white
man as though afraid dont come
-out without your hands up hanson 
for answer the law came out from
behind the palm trunk he carried his
rifle clubbed and though he limped
painfully he came straight on

  youre out of ammunition lucas
he said as he advanced and he said it
as though trying to convince himself
that it was true you know youre
out of ammunition the revolver was
pointing directly at his chest and he
still came on itll save no end of

trouble both for you and me-

  he was not more than five paces
distant now and he was staring at the
muzzle of the revolver as though fas-
cinated just so had felisi seen fish
come up out of the depths of the rock
pools to see the light of the torch and
be speared the white man stood quite
still as though thinking what he would
do then in a flash he raised the re-
volver to fling it in the face of the
law and the butt of the clubbed
ritic fell both missed their mark

  didnt i say- grunted the

law and the rest was lost in the
impact of their bodies the white man
had hut one arm the other could scarce
stand for lameness yet they rocked in
one anothers embrace for what seemed
minutes to felisi before crashing to
earth in a writhing heap they were
on the bank of a stream that ran
through the grove and felisi caught
her breath as they rolled nearer and
nearer the edge it was a four-foot
drop at most and the water was shal-
low trickling slowly over the bed of
powdered coral sand but felisi knew
that stream there were many like it
on luana

here on the ground the law had
the upper hand for he had the use of
both arms and his lame leg was not
such a handicap he was strong too-
-b i

stronger than the white man though
both were pitifully weak from their ex-
ertions would it never end they
jerked and strained

  suddenly the white man lay still
staring up into the roof of palm leaves
with agony written in every line of his
haggard face it was as though he
had been seized with sudden paralysis
--it was paralysis for the law had
a hold on his arm-a certain hold
surely this was the end but felisi
had taken sides and the polynesian
never turns back the law uttered
a stifled cry as her teeth sank into the
back of his hand the hold was lost
the arm free the white man kicked
out with ail his strength and the law
tottered for a moment before rolling
down the bank into the stream

  the water was not two inches in
depth yet when he struggled to rise he
sank knee-deep another supreme ef-
fort and the glistening white sand was
about his waist after that he sank
by inches his stern gray eyes turned
toward firm ground not three yards dis-
tant but uttering no sound

  the white man had fainted and
when his eyes opened felisi was bend-
ing over him

  come quick she said you all
right come quick-canoe him---

  wheres hanson muttered the
white man

  felisi pointed toward the river bank

  the while mans eyes opened wide

  in the river-drowned

  felisi shook her head

  him go long road all the same
pretty quick she told him reassuringly
but for some strange reason it failed
to reassure the white man crawled
to the edge of the bank and lay there
in the grass felisi could hear his
voice 

  what about it hanson

  there was no answer

  itll get you in less than an hour
dont be a fool

  still no answer and a long pause
during which the white man could have
reached the canoe felisi could have
shaken him

  i must get out of here hanson i


the cpocpulacr magazine

shall get clean away the girl has a
canoe what ever difference will it
make 

  there was actually a pleading note
in the voice

  was this one of the rules of the
game felisi gave it up her white
teeth snapped together in sheer exas-
peration

  good-bv hanson

  the white man staggered to his feet
and stood upright swaying for a mo-
ment then lurched off toward the
beach leaning on felisis shoulder

  twice he stopped dead in his tracks
and listened intently but no sound
came to them except the soft breath of
the trade wind among the palm leaves

  they launched the canoe in silence

  felisi did not speak she sat watch-
ing him from the main thwart and no-
ticing many things a frown had come
to his forehead and his eyes were rest-
less casting this way and that at noth-
ing save the dark waters slipping past
the canoe sometimes too he would
hold the paddle under his arm and pass
his hand over his eyes as though trying
to brush aside some vision that
haunted them but slowly she saw a
change steal over him set purpose
came into his eyes the grim mask of
his face gave way to animation-eager-
ness he muttered a curse at the fail-
ing wind and felisi became aware that
their course had changed with his mind
the canoe no longer headed for the
open sea and a little later she saw the
well-known coast line of luana loom-
ing over the bows fie had put back

  the canoe had no sooner grounded
than the white man leaped ashore and
ran up the beach felisi found him at
the bank of the stream-the sand had
risen to the chin of the law-tugging
and straining with his one hand

  it took them fullv half aru hour of
such work to extricate the law and
at the end of it the two men lay side
by side on the river bank too exhausted
to move or speak

  when at last the silence was broken
it was the law who spoke

  edward lucas he said rolling
onto his side i arrest you in the

name of the king for the murder of
walter crane

  the white man lav on his back with
closed eyes

  give me a fill of your heraldic
hanson he said

  it was two days before the white
man could walk and when lie crossed
the room trailing heraldic tobacco
smoke in his wake he caught sight of
the guard and turned back

  hanson he said wont you get
rid of this pantomime 

 the guard was dismissed-very
smartly

 the law was undoubtedly the
stronger man in one night his vitality
returned and when the white man was
up and about he sat talking with him
in the guest bouse felisi heard the
white man tell the story of the cutter
and the pearls and the hate and when
it was done the law nodded slowly
and said  yes i knew crane

  later that evening he went to the
door and stood looking out over the
green hills that tumbled to the sea

  its going to be a dark night he
said absently

  the white man was lying on a pile
of mats and did not answer

  a deuced dark night repeated the
law one of those nights when
things happen

  the white man lifted himself onto
his elbow but still remained silent

  and theres a fair northerly breeze
added the other irrelevantly

  the white man was staring fixedly
at the broad back of the law sil-
houetted in the doorway an eager
light flashed into his eyes and was gone

  yes he said slowly and lay back
on the mats

  in the morning he was gone

  so was felisis canoe but the law
made that good even as he scowled his
displeasure at the escape

  in the taro patch felisi often puckers
her brow over the problems of an
eventful life but in this particular
case she can get no farther in her de-
ductions than that the law is a big
fellah and the way of the white man
bevond belief

           by raymond j brown

             author of soft pickins  etc

of a born baseball player named jeremiah gilhooley who loved the
game better than anything else on earth but who would ac-
cept in salary nothing more than  for a seasons work

no son i aint tryin to tell you
there aint no bugs nothin
like it outside of my old
friend doc sturgis of the state
insane asylum i dont think theres
another guy in the world has met up
with more queer ones than me what
im drivin at though is that its wrong
to get off a feller just because he acts
peculiar maybe hes got some good
sensible reason for bein a nut wrhy
the greatest ball player that i ever seen
looked like he was cheatin in bein out
of the booby factory---until i got wise
to his plans and specifications

  ty whos talkin about ty ty
would only be a third-rater boldin on
to his job by his eyelashes if the game
had a few more like the bird i mean
besides ty couldnt have been more
than a little kid goin to school when
jeremiah gilhooley busted into the na-
tional pastime

  you never heard of gil eh well
that dont surprise me none gil only
tarried in the game about long enough
to raise a ripple-and that was prob-
ably a few years before your time

  it was in the old days when there
was only one league-with twelve clubs
-and johnny mcgraw was a scrappy
little shrimp playin third base for
hanlon in baltimore and cv young
was in his prime and grand old men
like honus wagner hadnt even been
heard of there wasnt no million-
dollar salaries in them days and there
wasnt so much red tape and system
and hokum about runnin a ball club
for instance we didnt have no regular

scouts the only way wed get a tip-
off on a promisin player would be
when hed crash in with his bat under
his arm and demand the right to show
us his wares-or when some friend
would see a kid playin on the lots and
let us know about it

  i had a friend named joe glynn who
played with me in the days when we
all wore whiskers and joe used to tell
me every now and then about a player
hed saw some place toe sent me a
letter early one season askin me when
the team reached new york or bos-
ton to sneak off to new haven some
day and look over the kid whos playin
right field for yale college now col-
lege ball players were about as common
in the league in them days as french-
men are in the german army now
fred tenney and one or two others had
busted in but there was so few of
them that us managers would have
thought of lookin for players in italy
about as quick as we would of lookin
for them in the colleges still id never
knew joe to give me a wrong steer
so i decides to do as he says

  early in june were playin a series
with the gints in new york-our team
was the old bluebirds-and i draw a
three-day suspension for appealin a
close decision i read in the evenin
paper that yale and harvard are to
play at new haven the followin after-
noon so as long as i was barred from
the grounds anyhow i decide to leave
the team flat and run up to see the game

  when i arrive in new haven the
town is full of doins its commence-


the popular magazine

merit week and the boys are raisin
cain now id always thought a col-
lege boy was a little guy with a long-
peaked cap and a tennis bat in one hand
and a mandolin in the other thats
the kind of pictures i always seen any-
how these fellers though was o k
except that some of them wore white
duck pants and others had on hang-
mans robes and square hats they was
just like young folks youd meet any-
wheres a good sociable bunch id
call them especially a big guy i met
in a barroom he was drinkin lemon-
ade by the way i asks him about the
ball game and leads the conversation
cautiouslike around to the yale right
fielder

  the big guys eyes sparkle are
you gils father he wants to know

  gil  i asks puzzled

  yes gil he says all smiles jerry
gilhooley the feller you asked about

  i was kind of shocked id always
had an idea that fellers who went to
them rich colleges avas named van
puyster and montmorency and i cer-
tainly believed that while they might
let a jones or a smith sneak in ncca-
sionayr they had no time for us mcs
and os

  no i says i aint his father i
iust heard hes a prettv good ball
player

  good exclaims my yale friend
good well i should say he is good
-good at anything he tries hes the
finest all-around man i ever knew hes
president of his class and valedictorian
and captain of the football team-and
hed be on the crew too he says only
hed rather play baseball

  as soon as he finds out t want to
see the game that afternoon he slips
me a ticket then he excuses himself
after givin me his card and askin me
up to see him id sized him up as
bein just a plain kid but when i looks
at the card t nearly faints hes young
jim west son of the jim west who
owned about every railroad and steam-
boat line in the country at that time
and him hobnobbin with an old rough-
neck ball player without askin no ques-

tions  pm beginnin to get a whole lot
of respect for this college stuff

  well when i gets out to the yale
ball park that afternoon i dont have
no trouble in pickin out young gil-
hooley the college boys was much
better ball players than i expected but
this bird is above them like the eiffel
towers above paris i never seen such
a graceful guy in an outfield i dont
mean graceful like a dancer for this
gilhooley is just the kind of a red-
headed rawboned young mick i was
myself at his age but he combined
strength and speed and ease of motion
in a way that would gladden your heart
you could see too by the way he
capered around that he just loved the
game about the only bad habit he
had was buttin into every play but
that wasnt such a bad habit at that
considerin how much better be was
than the tellers he was playin with

  you could see he was a hot favorite
with the yale crowd too every time
hed do anything-if it wasnt anything
more than knockin the dirt out of his
spikes-a little guyr down in front of
the grand stand would wave his arms
and the whole yale bunch would yell
together yea gil yea gil or
rah-rah somethin else but theyr al-
ways finished bv shoutin gil  it
wasnt half so foolish as it sounds for
i soon found myself gettin all worked
up with them

 as a game it wasnt much the
yale team was so much better than the
harvard boys that tbev win as they
pleased theres a big hullabaloo after
the game with a dozen young huskies
carrying gil on their shoulders out to
the dressin room t follow them out
and send in word by a nigger water
carrier that t want to see gil for a
few seconds after hes dressed he
asks me to wait around for him which
i do

  i get another shock when gil comes
out i expected with him bein the
king of yale and all that hed be a
nifty kind of feller-in clothes and all
that i mean bit he aint his suits
cheap and prcu threadbare his shoes
aint the kind id let any friend of
the willie of from yale



mine wear while i had the price to
stake him and with his freckled irish
face he looks more like a young
plumbers assistant or somethin like
that than a college boy

  he greets me with a smile that makes
me like him right off i could see
lies the same kind of a lively likable
kid off the field as he is on i get
right down to business offer him a
job with the bluebirds and ask him
how much he wants

  gil smiles a queer kind of smile and
looks awful thoughtful well mr
mccarthy he says at last i cant
help but admit your offer comes as a
big surprise playin baseball is one
means of livelihood i never consid-
ered i had other plans for myself
i cant give you an answer now but
i shall be very pleased to write to you
in a day or two and tell you if i can
accept your proposal by the way
he asks suddenly about how much
do you think my services would be
worth to you 

  about two thousand dollars a sea-
son i says

  two thousand dollars he repeats
slowlike i must admit im interested
but i cant let you know now can you
hold the offer open until saturday 

  sure i says take your time
son

  i leave him and stroll around town
until train time from some other stu-
dents i find out a whole lot about young
gilhooley it seems he comes from a
little town in connecticut where his
fathers in the contractin business
that is his fathers boss is for old
gilhooley drives a dump cart gil has
paid his way through college with
money he earned himself doing odd
jobs that ranged between cleanin win-
dow to helpin less bright but richer
guvs in their studies id never heard
of that wrinkle before and i can tell
you it didnt put gil down any in my
estimation neither did it make me
think any less of the rich college fellers
who treated gil like one of their own
kind

  true to his word gil sends me a
letter on saturday i reads it through

two times then i laugh hell play
with the bluebirds the letter says yes
gladly but about the salary question
-heres where the laugh come-he will
not accept a cent more or less than
eighteen hundred and seventy-three dol-
lars and sixty-seven cents i shows
the letter to jack cook secretary of
the club and he laughs too

  fie must believe theres luck in odd
numbers says jack

  yes i agrees or else he doesnt
wrant to get rusty on the figgerin he
learned at college and thinks hell prac-
tice on his monthly pay check

  i have jack write back to gil tellin
him we couldnt think of hirin him for
eighteen hundred and seventyr-three dol-
lars and sixty-seven cents but that well
be glad to pay him eighteen hundred
and seventy-four dollars

  gil sends us another letter thankin
us for our generosity but sayin he
cant think of acceptin the extra thirty-
three cents a year i gives it up

  tell him all right i sayrs to jack
but what do you think of a feller-a
poor feller too who needs the money
-turnin down two thousand a year
and bein only willin to take some
crazy amount like he wants

  you said it then jack replies
hes crazy

  gil shows up two days later well
my young figger sharp i greet him
hows the arithmetic to-day 

  how do you do mr mccarthy
says he kind of coldlike

  im a tough old bird and aint to be
froze did the railroad let you ride
down for four sixty-seven instead of
three-fifty i asks

  i know what youre referrin to
mr mccarthy he says and all i
can do to you as my employer is to
ask y-ou nof to chaff me about it my
reason for askin for the exact salary
i did is an excellent one but i cant
explain it to you i can assure yrou
though i shall endeavor to earn every
cent of what you pay me

  word of gils queer contract had
spread around the boyrs on the team
and they was layin for him leaguers
in them days was hard nuts for cer-


the popular magazine

tain and they was waitin to initiate
the willie boy from yale i could see
they was surprised-just like i was
myself-at the brawny young specimen
of an irish american t sprung on them
but that didnt stop them

  while i was doin the honors intro-
ducin gil to the bunch lefty flynn
our first baseman who was brought up
in the gashouse district of new york
says to joe matthews our shortstop a
wild fightin devil from the pennsyl-
vania coal mines poicy when youve
got your knittin done teacher wants
you to hurry to the gography clawss

  he said this in a high tone of voice
like he was a little girl gil could see
it was aimed at him he turns a brick
red through his freckles but he don-t
give them a tumble

  then joe matthews answers oh
clawrence i cawnt go to gography
clawss to-day mother is dustin an i
must stay home an help her

  now if these guys had had any
sense theyd have looked gil over good
before gettin rosy with him believe
me i like a scrap as good as the next
guy but i aint goin out lookin for
trouble with no six-foot baby with fists
as big as pavin blocks red hair and
a name like gilhooley

  gil drops hugh moores hand which
hed been shakin and goes across that
dressin-room floor with the same ease
speed an confidence i seen him use
chasin high flies in the yale ball park
fie gives flynn a queer poke with the
palm of his hand-i learned afterward
its what they call the straight arm
in football-and flynn goes shootin
the whole length of the room and lands
flat in a water bucket then gil picks
matthews up like he was a child
stretches him across his knee-and
spanks him 

  you should have heard the howl that
went up in that dressin room there
wasnt one of my boys who wouldnt
have liked to take a crack at matthews
-only he had them all scared and
now to see him handled like a baby
after gil had warmed matty good he
stands him on his feet wtith his face
in the corner-just like a bad kid in

school we all seen the point and
cheered matty and flynn with blood
in their eyes both start at gil at once
one or two of the boys was for in-
terferin but i waved them back i
never saw a guy handle himself any
better than gil he didnt strike a sin
gle blow just dodged twisted and
parried but he done more than if
hed put both flynn and mattyr out for
the count he made them look foolish
before about twenty other guys the
battle ended with gil givin both of
them the foot-a trick i know he must
have learned from his irish father
with flynn and matty layin on the
floor gil kind of rubs his hands and
says

  the onty reason i didnt thrash you
two ruffians within an inch of your
lives is because i realize mr mccarthy
needs you on the team i trust both
of you can handle a baseball better than
you can yrour fists

  another howl goes up at this i can
see gil is gettin awful popular with
the bunch gil turns to me mr
mccarthy he says before you intro-
duce me to any of the other gentlemen
of the team it might be well for me
to make a few remarks-to avoid fu-
ture trouble if possible if any of you
gentlemen he goes on are laboring
under the delusion that because i am
a college man i am going to be the
target for any silly jokes you are
greatly mistaken im just a common
feller like the rest of you my father
drives a dump cart-and ive worked
with a pick and shovel myself ive
probably wrorked as hard as any man
here youll find me without any frills
-and able to take care of myself

  the team cheers that is all bu matty
and flynn who are in the corner crab-
bin thats the talk young feller
calls out biff mccann our star back-
stop youre all right and well treat
you right the gang cheers again
and i finishes introducnt gil around

  gil makes good with a capital g
two weeks after he joined the team
i drop him in right field regular and
there he stays he was class all the
way through his battin was immense
the willie boy from yale



his fieldin grand and his base runnin

-every catcher in the league used to
get nervous as soon as gild get perched
on first

  and if he followed up the advantage
he got the day he joined the team gil
would have been the fair-haired boy
with the players the crowd and the
papers but he didnt he played
great ball but he done it in a wtay
that made it look like he wasnt doin
nothin if there was a play to be
made gil was always johnny-on-the-
spot if a hit had to be made to sew
up a game gil was always there with
the bingle but he wasnt playin the
way he did at yale what i mean is
he done his work much like a book-
keeper who never expects a raise in
salary does his-so much and no more
in the college game i seen gil played
like baseball was his one bug-kind
of wallowed around in the game he
done fancy jugglin tricks with the ball
and made one-hand catches-in prac-
tice of course i mean-and behaved
like he was havin the time of his life
with us hed never take three steps
where two would do there wasnt the
kind of dash and vim to him that makes
ty stand out he was the kind of fel-
ler that plays all season without never
doin nothin sensational-and then sur-
prises everybody when the averages is
published by leadin the league in bat-
tin fieldin and stolen bases much
like georgie burns of the gints

  t give gil a little jolt about this one
day

  am i earnin my salary he asks
me

  yes i says but--

  am i loafin at all

  no  but-

  am i omittin to do anything which
anv other outfielder would do 

  no you aint but-

  well wdtats the fault then he
demands

  the fault my boy i says is that
you could be the greatest player this
game ever knew-if youd only make
up your mind to do it au you need
do i says is to show more of that
get-up-and-go you had at yale get

on your toes make yourself promi-
nent  since youve been with the blue-
birds youve been about as prominent
as the bat boy-and you winnin games
and savin games for us every day
the newspapers dont take no notice
of you because-i dont know how you
do it-because you make star plays
right under the reporters eyes but you
hide them up at yale all i heard
was gil this and gil that since you
been with us i dont believe even the
players would know you were on the
team if it wasnt for that muss you had
with flynn and matthews wheres
your ambition 

  gil smiled it wasnt often these
days that he did smile for in addition
to goin about his work with all the
enthusiasm a sewer cleaner shows for
his he was keepin ailent and quiet-
almost sulkin he didnt mix in with
the other boys on the team he didnt
even live at the hotel with us but buried
himself in a cheap boardin house
downtown he was around in time for
the game each day and left the
grounds as soon as he could get his
clothes on what he did the rest of
the time none of us knew

  as i said gil smiled when i asked
him about his ambition but it was a
sad kind of a smile-no joy in it at all

  my ambitions all right mr mc-
carthy he said i dont want to
appear abrupt-or disrespectful-but
ill have to ask y-ou not to bother about
whether i get my name in the papers or
whether the patrons of the game like
me-so long as i do my work satis-
factorily

  with that he turns and leaves me
now me bein a fairly intelligent if
uneducated sort of a feller i could
wonder what it was that was the
matter with gil i often thought about
his eighteen-hundred-and-seventy-three-
dollar-and-sixty-seven-cent salary the
same as i thought about his queer be-
havior and tried to connect the two
the other members of the team though
just put gil down as a nut and let it
go at that if he didnt want to mix
whyr they didnt want to neither
whether he played half as good as he


the popular magazine

could or two times better was nothin
in their lives so that part of it didnt
bother them at all

  they did try a little friendh kiddin
but gil took it so serious they quit i
tried to tell them gil was a regular
feller at heart explainin how big he
went at yale to prove my point but
they wouldnt have none of it he was
crazy and crazy men wasnt their idea
of people to associate with

  to see gil arguin with an empire
was a sketch  oh yes he did dispute
a close one now and then-suppose he
thought that was part of his job some-
thin he was bein paid for hed go
about it awful quiet and polite which
was so different from the way the or-
dinary run of roughneck ball players
done it that the empires used to listen
to him and argue back instead of just
turnin their backs-or pullin the
watch on him also he done somethin
i never seen no ball player do before
or since he had at least half a dozen
decisions reversed in a season just
on the rules for gil knew the base-
ball guide better than the man that
wrote it

  i think mr so-and-so hed say
to the empire if you look at section
two of rule fifteen youll find that a

ball batted out of bounds- and so

forth and the empire would get out
his bible and sure enough gil would
be right and hed be so nice about it
that the empire would change his
decision-and without gettin sore
neither

  you ought to be a lawyer gil i
told him after one game hed saved
for us by knowin a section of the rules
that even i had overlooked

  he smiled that funny sad smile of
his tin satisfied as things are he
said

  at the end of the season as is cus-
tomary i give the bovs a little talkin
to about the next year-what i plan to
do with the team how theyre to keep
in condition durin the winter and so
forth i tell gil im goin to raise his
salary

  youre the lowest-paid player i got
i says considerin the work you been

doin so your contract for next season
will read twenty-five hundred that is
i adds not bein able to resist havin
a little fun with him that is unless
youd prefer to get twenty-four hun-
dred and ninety-nine dollars and six-
teen cents

  no gil almost shouts emphat-
ically no i must be paid the same
amount as this year-or i must refuse
to play

  well i suggests if you dont
want it let me send it to your folks
they could use it

  no he barks again i mustnt
i cant

  youre the funniest feller i ever
seen in the league i tells him i
never seen a ball player yet whod re-
fuse a raise in salary

  i cant help that says gil i can
play only at my own price and by
the way he continues the club made
a mistake of four cents in payin me
this year examination of the checks
will verify this

  is the mistake in your favor i
asks

  yesv says gil

  i thought so says i well give
me a couple of stamps and ill turn
them in for you that is unless you
want it to be a cash transaction

  i prefer it that way says gil seri-
ous as though he was talkin about
thousands and he gives me a nickel
and i gives him a cent change and we
part for the winter

  well gils second season with the
bluebirds was a repetition of the first
-if not more so he was quieter and
more distant than ever even i couldnt
get friendly with him he played the
same kind of a mechanically perfect
game and kept just as much in the
background so far as press notices and
cheers from the stands was concerned

  long about july i dope up what
i think is a rare scheme for wakin gil
up i meet him after a game with the
orioles whod beat us eight to three
and say

  gil your playin this year aint been
nothin to brag about now that
young rookie forsythe is beginnin to
the willie boy fom yale



look almost good enough to get a trial
in right field

  i waits for this to sink in now the
truth was id have benched gil about
as quick as id have cut off my right
arm-not so quick even gil blinks
at me thus far this season he says
my battin average has been three-
fifty-eight which is equivalent to sayin
im leadin the league my fieldin has
been perfect for i have yet to make
my first error unless somebody else-
where stole ten bases to-day i am
leading the league in that department
if young forsythe can do better i con-
gratulate you on having a find and i
shall step down cheerfully in his favor

  talk about gettin the wind taken out
of my sails  im struck dumb i usu-
ally got an answer ready but gil
floored me this time for sure hed
called my bluff and i wasnt ready to
meet it

  gil never bats an eye is that all 
he asks

  y-yes i stammers

  without another word gil walks out
of the park instead of gettin sore
at havin him put it over on me like
that i laugh any other guy on the
team if he was told there was some-
body else waitin to grab off his job
would have started to bluster or else
would have pulled a spurt in his playin
for a while not gil though he
hands me a mouthful of statistics and
the next day plars his position in the
same easy calm way and all there is
for me to do is to admit im beat which
i do and me and tack cook have a big
laugh over it

  that year we had the closest fight
the old twelve-club league ever knew
th orioles and us is neck and neck
all season and we come to the last
game of the year-played on our
grounds-absolutely even nothin like
it ever happened before and nothin
like it happened again for almost
twenty years when the gints and cubs
got mixed up in the fracas in which
merkle forgot to touch second

  before the game im nervous as a
girl at her first ball i give the team
a stiff talkin to in the clubhouse and

get so excited fm sayin some things
i probly dont mean when gil butts in

  mr mccarthy he says-in two
whole years he hadnt got out of the
habit of calling me mister-mr
mccarthy i think you would do well
to let the boys go in and play without
further instructions weve been play-
in together all seaon we know our
positions and your methods and any-
thing you say now i believe would have
the effect of exciting us making us
nervous rather than keying us up to
our best efforts

  as i said before i wasnt myself
so instead of seein the sense of what
gil said i gets peeved and turns on
him

  shut up yrou i orders if youd
been playin the game this season in-
stead of layin down on us we wouldnt
have to be playin off no tie to-day
wed have the pennant won already
now this was untrue and unfair
and gil knew it as well as i so did
the other fellers on the team  for al-
though theyd give gil up as a bug
they all knew he was pretty near the
star of the league and that it was him
more than anybody else on the team-
myself included-who had kept us tied
with the orioles instead of about ten
games behind them

  gil though doesnt get sore very
well mr mccarthy he says i wyas
merely offering a suggestion

  i dont want none of our sugges-
tions  i shouts im runnin this
team and the quicker- you find it out

  here i stop sudden with my mouth
open nobodys payin any attention
to me theyre all watchin gil hes
leaped up from his chair and run over
to joe morris our little third baseman
say joe he says to him ive seen
you practicin dance steps and acrobatic
tricks a lot do you think you could
do this stunt 

  with that gil gets his long legs all
twisted up and seems to kind of col-
lapse to the fiooi then he unwinds
himself spins around on his head a
couple of times and springs to his feet
it was a funny little trick and worthy


the popular magazine

of a circus clown also it went bigger
than it would usually on account of
gil never havin done no foolin of the
kind before the gang laughs

  gil grins a little sees he has the
bunch goin and cuts another caper
then he starts whistlin turkey in the
straw while he does a queer rube
dance he dont let up none in his
vaudeville specialty but starts tellin
funny stories as soon as his dance is
done the gangs all around him so in-
terested theyve forgotten theyre play-
in off a tie for the pennant and all
their other troubles i even find myself
losin my grouch-for gils stories sure
were funny and new gil looks over
the heads of the bunch catches my eye
and winks then i see what hes up
to hes seen that the fellers on the
team was all nervous and upset from
the thought of lockin horns with the
orioles hes also seen that the speech
i was makin to them was lible to get
their goats so bad that theyd go up
in the air altogether and not be able to
play at all so he just butts in shuts
me up and takes the teams minds off
the game with a little tomfoolery i
could have kissed him on both his
homely freckled cheeks

  well gil keeps up a runnin fire of
gab all the time the bunch is dressin
and right out into the field you could
hear his big voice all over the grounds
after wed took the field for practice
he wras kiddin this feller and that fel-
ler and they was cornin back at him-
all havin as good a time as if it was
an exhibition game with twenty-five
apiece and expenses in it for them
gils catchin flies behind his back and
runnin around the outfield like a young
colt and for the first time since hes
been a leaguer hes gettin a tumble
from the crowd in the stands

  practice over gil does a funny thing
he walks up to ike nelson whos
warmin up to pitch for the orioles
hits him a slap on the back and says
nelson were goin to be good to you
for a few innings but look out for the
eighth in the eighth were - goin to
knock you out of the box

  he says this without a smile nel-

son turns around and finds gil glarin
at him the eighth gil repeats
e-i-g-h-t-h he spells in the eighth
inning were goin to knock you out
of the box im not foolin with
that he walks away

  now nelson was a good twirier but
he never did have very good machinery
above the ears and what gil said to
him was puzzlin he looks kind of
bewildered as though he didnt know
whether to believe gil or not he
pitches a ball and it goes clean up into
the stand gil sees it and walks back

  not now nelson he says in the
eighth you can pitch all right now

  you could see nelsons goat was
bein got so we all follow gils lead
a regular parade of us passes behind
nelson and all of us tell him somethin
about whats goin to happen to him
in the eighth inning by the time he
goes into the box to give us our first
licks the sweat is pourin off him and
wilbert robinson whos catchin him
has all he can do to keep him from
goin up in the air then and there

  it just happens that some fast fieldin
saves nelson in the first inning this
has the effect of bringin him down on
earth in his ox-headed way he rea-
sons that the eighth inning is a long
way off and that he might as w-ell
pitch ball until then from that time
on its nip and tuck with sensational
fieldin bein all that keeps both teams
from havin the game sewed up on
them gil is a marvel playin his own
position like a demon lies lookin out
for every other man on the team at
the same time much like he did at
yale hes encouragin this feller and
bawlin out that one kiddin the shirts
off them tough birds of orioles-play-
in the game as i never seen no one
but him do it

  its too bad with him really bein
responsible for the brand of ball we
was playin that it couldnt have been
his bat that win the game for us but
in the eighth inning when true to gils
prediction we bat ike nelson out of the
box gils only contribution is a
screamin liner that johnny mcgraw
spears by jumpin about nine feet in the
the willie boy from yale



air before halon can put the skids
under nelson the harms done and we
got three runs and the game

  lonnie smith our pitcher adds in-
sult to defeat in the ninth by retirin
the orioles on strikes

  gil is the first guy off the field after
lennie puts over the last ball hes
waitin for us in the dressin room when
we file in he runs over to me throws
his arms around me and hugs me till
i thought my ribs was busted

  im free he shouts free
wish i was i grunts under his
bear hug

  gil lifts me clear of the floor and
swings me around

  im free he shouts again do
you hear that-free

  he lets go of me and  feel my chest
to see if theres any dents in it

  whatinelts eatin you i asks him
dont you see he demands his
face all lighted up like a kids at christ-
mas dont you see  i dont have
to play baseball for a livin any more
whe-e-e he cheers dancin around
like he was wound up

  the other guys on the team are
watchin him close all wonderin if he
aint even nuttier than they always
thought

  i dont know what youre talkin
about i says to him

  dont you he asks his eyes danc-
in well ill tell you ive been
playin baseball for two years for
money now i can play it for fun
youre goin to play without no
salary  i says no eighteen hun-
dred and seventy-three dollars and
sixty-seven cents 

  not from you says gil nor from
any other professional team ive
played baseball as a professional for
the last time

  youre goin to quit i stammers
and you just gettin into your stride

why man yrou-

  you can just bet im goin to quit
gil breaks in you may not be able
to understand it but i am maybe
id better explain it he suggests

  i should say you had better says

i im plumb disgusted disappointed
and sore here was my best player-
the best player i ever seen in fact-
walkin out on me because-because of
some fool reason like his crazy ideas
about salary for instance

  well says gil this is the whole
torv baseball is my one love its
almost the breath of my life i love
the game i love to play it love to
see it love to think it its always
been so-ever since i was a little boy
playin with the yale team was the
one thing that kept my courage up
gave me relaxation while i was strug-
glin pinchin and scrapin to pay my
way through college now ive got an
ambition-one that must be fulfilled
i want to be a lawyer in fact  mu
a lawyer for i got word this week that
id passed myr bar examinations in mas-
sachusetts i took them the last time
we were playin in boston

  now the reason i say myr ambition
to be a lawyer must be fulfilled is be-
cause i realize i have quite a lot of
talent in that direction you fellers
ought to know that he says with a
little smile for any chap who can
argue down a baseball empire oughtnt
to be afraid of the supreme court to
my way of thinkin and in accordance
with the way i wasbrought up id be
doin wrong committin a sin if i didnt
use the talent god gave me-particu-
larly since there may be some poor fel-
ler in this world somebody ive never
heard of who may need that talent
some day to clear him of a wrongful
accusation some of yrou fellers may
not look on it that way but thats my
viewpoint and thats why mr mc-
carthys offer was such a big tempta-
tion to me a temptation ive had to
fight every single dayr for the last two
years the chance he gave me of
makin a very good livin by doin
somethin that to me was just fun ap-
pealed to me strongly thats why i
couldnt let irself go couldnt plar
the game as hard as id have liked to
couldnt form friendships and affilia-
tions with the fellers of the team i
was afraid if i got too much interested
in baseball id give in to the temptation


the popular magazine

to make it my life work and that of
course would mean givin up my law
and my ideals and ambitions

  the rather peculiar salary i insisted
upon receivin from the club which all
you boys have had such a lot of fun
about that was part of my plan to use
baseball as a stepping-stone to the law
when mr mccarthy first spoke to me
about joinin the team i sat down and
figgered out very carefully the exact
amount of moneys id need to keep my-
self goin until id completed my law
studies i took account of what id
need for my folks at home what it
would cost me to live and how much
id have to pay to fit up my office i
went into it rather thoroughly even
estimating my railroad fares now i
felt at the time that the wayr i knew
id have to act while i was with the
club wouldnt tend to make me very
popular with the other boys so i took
care of that too ive got about sev-
enty-five dollars more than i can pos-
sibly need to establish mvself and every
last cent of it is goin to be spent to-
night on a blow-out for y-ou boys-just
to show you that gilhoow the crazy
willie boy from yale isnt such a bad
feller as you probably thought him

  gil stops the bunch is lookin at
him with mouths open they dont
savvy him at all his line of stuff is
-all over their heads how a guy can
pass up a good livin and take a good
chance of starvin to death for what he
calls ideals-them words dont mean
nothin to them 

  lefty flynn-lefty the hard guy-
is the first one to get hep to gils line
of talk he rushes over and slaps gil

on the back kid he says i probaly
hated you wrorse than any guy on the
club but i take it all back youre
o k and it wont be long before every
son of a gun here will be boastin about
knowin you 

  with that a cheer goes up and the
gang starts to hustle gil around much
like the yale boys used to theyre all
wishin him success and pattin his
back and apologizin for havin had him
wrong it was some love feasfl

  and we had a party that night too
only the gang wouldnt stand for gil
spendin a cent of the money hed saved
they make him keep it and i sand-
bag them for fifty bucks apiece and
force it on gil to buy his law library
with

  which is why i tell y-ou never to get
off a guy that acts peculiar until you
get all the inside dope on him the
chances is that the feller with nerve
enough to do things different from
other folks is a darn sight saner than
the people thats criticizm him and
laughin at him

  gil done another crazy trick only a
couple of months ago he throws up
a law practice worth forty thou a year
-a guy like him couldnt help makln
good-to take a puny little job under
the -secretary of war figgered his
uncle sam needed him now that the
countrys in a jam more than the cor-
poration he was workin for oh yes
gils crazy-crazy like abe lincoln
and christopher columbus and gari-
baldi and george washington and all
the other guys who done things that
was not accordin to the rules in the
official guide

untouched by the war

pfrcy heath the theatrical man was commending the campaign of
the american library association to give the american soldiers at the
front an ample supply of reading matter in the shape of books and maga-
zines

    its a great movement said heath but so far as the fellows who
stay at home are concerned it has one flaw i see that the association says no
magazine over two years old should be sent to the front this means that
we who patronize doctors and dentists will have to go against the same old
magazines weve been reading in their waiting rooms for the past ten years
the buttons of bo bing

by j frank davis

author of garland-ranger arrows of circumstance etc

   four copper buttons fashioned centuries ago are at the bottom of the
singular entanglements that take place in this story beginning with the
death of young carruth on the eve of the tennis tournament at forest
gardens though worth a fortune to the curio collector young carruth
had worn the redgold buttons on his waistcoat indifferent to their value
and their temptation to avaricious eyes that watched mr davis gives us
one of his best mysteries in this novel

a three-part story-part one

chapter i

a tinge of red

who could have expected that
the buttons of bo bing would
ever appear at the forest
gardens inn fastening the
dress waistcoat of a lean american boy
with arrogant eyes on the eve of the
forest gardens  tennis tourna-
ment 

  not bo bing surely if that really
was his name not the yellow shock-
haired narrow-eyed artificer who made
them either for he died long before
there was a forest gardens inn be-
fore long island on which the hotel
is built ever had a white inhabitant
before ever there was a new amster-
dam

  christopher columbus had not been
bom when the artisan whose name no-
body ever took pains to remember de-
signed these four buttons fashioning
them out of the copper that glints in
the mountains of yunnan and pres-
ently paid for his genius with his life

  the manner in which he made and
lacquered them was his own accidental
discovery he was hardly more than
a barbarian and his primitive furnace
and workbench stood far up in the

hills beside the headwaters of the sang-
koi river but he wrought as here and
there men in all ages have wrought
for love of beauty and joy of creation
he paid small heed to the battles that
swayed across his distant province
where the mongol hordes were making
their last stand against the armies of
the great hungwu perhaps he had
never even heard of the all-powrerful
emperor

  then the mongols were gone and
conquerors came to the headwaters of
the sang-koi and a ming general see-
ing the buttons had their designer
haled before him by spearmen when
the artificer trembling faltered that
this was indeed his own invention that
there were no other such ornaments
yet made and that the process by which
he had worked the marvel was still a
secret within his brain the general told
them to strike so the workman and
his knowledge perished then and there
upon the spears

  in this the fierce commander of
plungwus armies thought he had played
a crafty game it seemed to him that
when he should take these buttons to
the emperor telling him there were
none such elsewhere in all the world--
no and never should be-his would be


the cpocpulflcr maqazine

a reward of favor and glory but his
foresight was not the equal of his cun-
ning forehead to earth he boastfully
told the story and the great hungwu
smiling sadly sent him to the hsing
pu-the board of punishments for
itungwu was gray with years and wis-
dom and in his youth he had been a
buddhist monk and gained respect for
knowledge and skill and all the arts

  so hungwu first of the mighty 
dynasty of ming had the general killed
forthwith and ordered that the buttons
be placed in the haniin college and
now after more than five centuries
here they were shimmering dully upon
the white waistcoat of a straight-shoul-
dered american youth as he crossed
the forest gardens inn ballroom with
head that nodded right and left to a
dozen acquaintances but eyes that sawr
only grace flartley where she sat on
a cushioned bench in the corner

  the ballroom was large to match the
hotels nearly three hundred rooms fill-
ing one end of the ground floor so
that broad piazzas surrounded it on
three sides with a half dozen wide
doors now swung open giving access
to them through one of these doors
two men smoking comfortably in porch
chairs surveyed the dancers

  they were men of about the same
age-forty-five or so-and any one
with half aneve who had seen their
meeting and the quality of their hand-
clasp twenty minutes before and the
eagerness with which they hastened to
gain seats in a spot of comparative
quiet would have known them for old
friends

  one was a man inclined to stoutness
without tending in the slightest toward
the gross a man of pink smooth-
shaven face clear inquiring blue eyes
and long white hands with firm com-
petent fingers his manner was that
of one accustomed to authority and a
degree of deference the hotel where
he was spending his nights for the
month of august knew him for one of
its most famous guests-perryr eaton
the general surgeon whose skill was
daily talk in every newr york hospital
and whose name among the demonstra-

tors at any clinic or the speakers at
any surgical convention meant an at-
tendance that tested the capacity of
amphitheater or hall

  his friend was not so well known
he had registered at the inn only that
saturday afternoon coming down from
the city for the tennis tournament that
was to begin on monday his appear-
ance was in striking contrast to the
doctors well-fed rotundity for he was
very tall rather lank of dark saturnine
countenance peering out upon the
world through thick-lensed nose
glasses his hair once black as an
indians was graying his hands
browtn and muscular but not delicate
or tapering were attached to long arms
byr wrists of an almost incredible
thickness one used to thinking in po-
lice terms would say that no handcuffs
could be snapped over those wrists that
he could not pull his hands through
that would be a true guess it had been
tried long ago purely as a police ex-
periment at his request

  he seemed to stoop a little as he
walked though this was largely a mat-
ter of appearance only due to his my-
opic vision for his shoulders were
straight and muscular and the bend
that made him seem to stoop was at
his neck he smiled easily but fleet-
ingly and although he was clad in
the best of taste and in a fashion that
was modish without being the extreme
affected by youth or by those of middle
age who hope to pass for youth he
unconsciously and quite untruthfully
succeeded in giving the impression that
he was careless about his ress some
one had once remarked that he fell
just short of being distinguished look-
ing in nearly a dozen wavs

  he was a bostonian by birth a xew
yorker by adoption a man of means
by inheritance a gentleman of culture
by breeding and education and his
name was endicott worth

   it is one of the penalties of living
in the great city that a man sees even
his best friends only occasionally un-
less he goes out of his way to find
them he was sayang and when he
does he interferes with their business
the buttons of o bing	

i havent set eyes on you since febru-
ary but ive kept track of your work
jt is going magnificently old man
those last two operations you devised
-and a medical friend of mine told
me the other day that a gastro-enter-
ostomy in your hands is no more dan-
gerous nowadays than a simple appen-
dicitis

  i dont lose many doctor eaton
admitted modestly but with full and
grateful appreciation of his own skill
and ive kept track of you too what
with my clinics and papers and books
-ive recently written another one
perhaps you know-i dont have much
time to read but i dont miss any of
those monthly- philosophy of life es-
says that you have in the interdepend-
ent we get some philosophy of life
ourselves we surgeons but those es-
says of vours-theyre great

  no worth said not great but
perhaps theyre competent

   the doctor laughed afifectionatel
still the stickler for exact shades
of meaning lie said well i suppose
that is one of the reasons why your
articles are different you say exactly
what you mean

   i never could see sense in using the
wrong word to express an idea when
there are so many words to choose
from-one of them right the essayist
said now take that boy who is just
crossing the room toward the girl in
pink how would you describe his
eyes 

  which boy

  the tall straight-shouldered one
he is just passing the group of young
men about the girl in green the one
-he noted the lads peculiarity of dress
-with a tinge of red in his waistcoat
buttons

  that is young carruth the doctor
said his eyes-why i think id de-
scribe them as-er-bright

  which covers a dozen kinds of
eyres declared worth the word for
his i think is predatory he has
grown talleri didnt recognize him
although i siw him play two years
ago

  he wasnt in any of the tourna-

ments last year his father had just
died-william p carruth the globe-
trotter  guess predatory is right
and if you knew old bill you know
the youngster comes by that kind of
eyes honestly

   he is playing this year i take it
yes-and a snappy game a good
many people are looking to see either
carruth or alton parke take the tour-
nament if they both come up through
the semifinals t should call it anybodys
match at the finish parke was over
driving an ambulance for a year but
they say he has rounded into good form
since he got back he has been west
and hasnt played on long island yet
and the young lady she is try-
ing to look delighted to see him and
she isnt especially

  more of your exact observation eh
well at that maybe you are right
although how a confirmed bachelor like
you-- her name is hartley she
and her mother live over here on one
of the streets back of the courts her
father was franklin hartley you
must have known him  he was a senior
when we were sophs

  worth peered with freshened inter-
est in the girls direction

   i knew him quite well he said al-
though not at school he beat me at
newport in  the year he got into
the semifinals and might have been
champion if his endurance had been as
good as his stroke worth laughed
quizzically if-if-if he said
just as i might have been champion
in  if my legs had been as good
as my wrists

  as miss hartley moved to one side
to make room for the boy to take a
seat beside her the trend of mr
worths thoughts changed i this
youngsters first name leland  he sud-
denly asked

  yes at least t think so he is
always called lee

  that explains why he is limping
slightly i didnt place him as the
same

  what are you talking about the
same as what


the popular magazine

  i suppose you read this mornings
newspapers

  as a matter of fact i didnt-bar-
ring the headlines and the first few
paragraphs of the war news which i
ran over during breakfast i caught
the seven-forty-two for town and all
the way in on the train i worked on a
paper im preparing for a medical soci-
ety i did three private operations and
a clinic before lunch

  you didnt happen then to see
about a riot last night up in the thir-
ties near broadway-caused by a
crowd of pacifists and pro-germans
who were holding a soap-box meeting
under the name of friends of liberty
only the headlines police drove
them off finally didnt they and made
some arrests 

  yes you didnt notice the name
of the young man wdio started the
trouble by hauling one of the speakers
down off his box of course it was
leland carruth

  the surgeon looked harder in the
young mans direction

  bully for him he said pie is
a red-blooded american anyway
apparently the dry quality of
worths voice did not escape his
friend worth hastened to explain
what he took exception to was an
especially outrageous attack on eng-
land and it appears from the news-
paper accounts that his mother was
english and that he has spent quite a 
little time there not that what the
speaker said about our allies was some-
thing any red-blooded american ought
not to have resented under the circum-
stances  in fact from the way the
patriots in that crowd kicked the pro-
german agitators all over the street be-
fore the police could rescue them i
take it for granted plenty of them did
resent it but i didnt see anything
in the papers to the cffect that this
carruth had gone to plattsburg or
offered to enlist or anything of that
sort he looks-he appraised the
youth across the ballroom closely-
like a boy who would let his temper
get the better of him quite easily it
happened to be in a good cause last

night that being the case why go more
closely into his motives

  the orchestra without warning
crashed into the slightly discordant
strains of off-pitched instruments that
were the rage of ultrafashionable dance
floors at this time and the floor imme-
diately filled with dancers lee car-
ruth and miss hartley rose and swung
out into the rhythm of the one-stcp
doctor eaton followed them for a few
seconds with a professional eye

  whatever happened to him in that
street fight isnt likely to interfere with
his game next week he remarked
if it were either his knee or his ankle
he wouldnt be dancing

  the rising beat of jazz music plus
the swish and shuffle of the dancers
made further conversation difficult and
the friends sat back in their chairs
when the dance came to an end with
the usual double encore they had
thought of new subjects to discuss

  doctor eaton and endicott worth
were not the only persons to show
more than the casual interest of ac-
quaintanceship in the arrival at the
dance of young carruth

  on the opposite piazza also viewing
the scene through an open door a tall
gaunt leathery-skinned man of fifty-
five with a face singular for its ex-
pressionless immobility no less than for
its peculiar coloring smoked quietly
slumped back in his chair in an atti-
tude of absolute relaxation a careless
observer might have thought him a
man to whom intense physical activity
would be repugnant one accustomed
to appraising those who live in the
broad spaces on the worlds frontiers
would have sensed perhaps that he
was one of those who have learned to
conserve in time of inaction all the
powers of muscle and nerve that may
be needed in moments of stress

  his face in repose was hard and
set faded weather-burned blue eyes
looked expressionlessly out from under
slightly puffy lids there was some-
thing arrogant in his bearing even when
he sat thus relaxed one would take
him to be a man always sure of him-
self and sometimes contemptuous of
the buttons of o bing

si

others his excellent clothes his man-
ner of wearing them the ease with
which he carried himself all went to
proclaim him a wealthy man probably
a cultured one

  beside this tall gaunt personage-
and even the casual stranger would be
justified in assuming that he was a
personage-a much younger man also
well dressed but indefinably giving the
impression of less ease and assurance
watched the dance and occasionally
conversed briefly with the elder he
was barely more than thirty but in
strong lights looked ten years older
in contrast to the older mans impas-
sivity his motions were frequent and
abrupt he gestured with short quick
movements obviously a rather nerv-
ous man for his years

  the pair had one thing in common
both were deeply tanned it was not
the color that a new york summer

  the inn which was familiar with the
pair-although nobody ever felt very
well acquainted with either-knew they
bad gathered this color as one of them
had gathered nerve control and the
other nerve tension by adventurous
journeys in the far corners of the earth

  the older man was bayard williams
millionaire traveler big-game hunter
and collector every reader of the
sunday supplements was familiar with
his quests and adventures his icy nerve
bis bobbies his almost priceless collec-
tion of asian jewelry and ornaments
the younger man was harris camblin
williams secretary- traveling compan-
ion confidential man and fidus
achates

  the eyes of both were fixed on eee
carruth as he crossed the dance floor
with his barely perceptible limp and
took the seat miss hartley made for
him at her side

  camblin spoke low-voiced a note of
incredulity in his tone 

  b r

  hes got them on

  williams nodded the young fool
he replied it was not said with bitter-
ness but merely as though the speaker
in passing stated a self-evident fact

  camblins brows drew into a frown
risking that value in a place like
this he muttered he might lose

one he might-

  williams frequently ignored risks
and often did not consider them his
exasperation was as great as that of his
secretary but for a different reason

  it is an insult to such possessions
to make so common with them he
said old bill would turn over in his

grave such lack of appreciation-

he left the sentence unfinished

  sacrilege is the word camblin put
in falling in with his employers senti-
ment but if he loses them-

  may the man that gets them be a
better man than he is williams rum-
bled if he is a man wrho knows how
to appreciate them he has my sym-
pathy they are wasted on this young
snob

  camblins eyes narrowed do you
suppose he is wearing them just to
flaunt them in your face  he asked
after the wav he replied to vour
offer-

  perhaps williams replied calmly
he is young enough to do a fool thing
like that i didnt even know he had
them here perhaps he went up to
town and got them after you talked
with him  didnt see him around here
last night

  there was a brief pause during
which the dance came to an end

  i saw wong chew this evening
camblin said

  williams looked up quickly

 here at forest gardens what
was he doing here

  t dont know we didnt speak
i dont think he saw me at all it was
while i was taking a little walk after
dinner and he was coming down
lafayette avenue heading toward the
station  he might have come from
graftons house where carruth is stay-
ing

  the buttons come to forest gar-


the ppuljr magazine

dens and then wong chew mused
williams theres a connection
where you see that old chinese there
is loot-or intrigue of course you
havent any idea whether or not he saw
carruth

  none whatever i dont even know
whether carruth was in forest gar-
dens at that hour he may have come
out from town later

  whom else could old wong have
been calling on i wonder if--
didnt you tell me there was a china-
boy servant up at graftons

  no japanese

  not much chance he could be one
of w ongs many handy helpers most
japs hate wong itmm williams
pondered in silence for a moment his
eyes still following lee carruth and
grace hartley as they returned to their
place in the corner its a hundred-
to-one bet the old man didnt come
down here either to get a line on the
tennis probabilities or to pay a social
call hes in the market for them
well to be forewarned is to know how
far youve got to go we know wong
for a bidder who will push in chips
until his roll is gone and never bat an
eye-and it isnt a small roll either
so-

  the connoisseur in asian jewelry
and ornaments sat a moment in thought
then spoke with decision and a voice
that was slightly raised although he
sat as passive as before

  whatever the cost im going to get
those buttons with old wong after
them too that means ill have to
hurry

  what are they really worth  cam-
blin whispered to you

  when i had you offer twenty-five
thousand thursday williams said i
told you that was my limit i thought
it was but with wong bidding--the
passion of the indefatigable collector
glinted momentarily in his faded eyes
-i shant stop this side of fifty

  both men noticed at this moment
that miss hartley was coming in their
direction quite evidently on her way
to leave the dance young carruth
hovering gallantly at her elbow as the

girl came within hearing she paused
a second to say good night to a friend

  why areyou going so early the
friend demanded gayly youll miss
a lot this is the liveliest jiarty of
the season

  i promised mamma i wouldnt be
later than half past ten miss hartley
replied she had to stay home with
a headache all alone

  williams followed the disappearing
figures of carruth and the girl with
his eyes i wonder he said under
his breath to camblin how long he
will stay at her house not long prob-
ably if her mother is not feeling well
then will he come back here or go
to graftons

  he rose a moment later im go-
ing to take a bit of a walk he said
dont go to bed until i get back

  his secretary looked at him inquir-
ingly but williams did not answer the
implied question i shall be back be-
fore midnight he said perhaps
quite soon

  he set off down the piazza toward
the main entrance where he turned into
the big lobby five minutes later his
secretary saw him come out with his
hat and stick and set oft leisurely in
the direction of lafayette avenue for
some moments camblin sat in thought
a twitching of his eyebrows indicated
that it was puzzling nervous thought
then he too wandered quietly toward
the entrance ascended in the elevator
to his room and came down immedi-
ately wearing his hat

  while he stood a moment on the
steps as though undecided in which
direction to walk an automobile slid
to a stop in front of the hotel and a
young man got out this youth was
evidently in no leisurely mood he went
into his pocket so hastily for the chauf-
feurs fee that he dragged out a glove
which fell to the ground and stopped
to pick it up with an exclamation of
impatience gesturing to the bell boy
who had come running down the steps
to take his luggage he made his way
into the hotel office

camblin went slowly down the steps
as the arrival came briskly up he
the buttons of  bing



paused by the curb a moment later
as though having suddenly reached a
decision he was swinging up the street
in the direction taken by his employer

  the young man who had come in the
automobile went at once to the desk
and registered the clerk on duty read
his signature upside down even as he
indited it and smiled a professional
smile of greeting

  good evening mr parke he said
we have your reservation all made 
very nice room and bath-number
three hundred and sixteen will you
go right up

  thank you yes the young man
said tn the brilliant light at the desk
it was to be seen that he wtas a very
personable young man clear-eyed
brown-skinned in fine condition al-
ready a number of people had bowed
to him and as he turned to follow the
bell boy who had his bags a youth
detached himself from a group that
had come out of the ballroom to sur-
round a punch bowl in a corner and
hurried to him cordial hand out-
stretched

  good old alton he cried wel-
come to our fair community hows
things 

  every little thing is all right
parke laughed except that i have
had so many delays to-day i thought
id never get here eve promised to
start on a little trip from new london
with the thompsons--you remember
shank thompson dont you -a- week
from to-day after bluefish while i
was over on the other side somebody
ni laid all my fishing togs-put them
avv so safely for me that i couldnt
imd them i suppose-and as i shall
  vo to leave here the minute the tour-
raknt is over in order to keep my
a ointment with the fish i couldnt
 off getting a new outfit and if
you think it is an easy job to find blue
ii-h line in new york on a saturday
afternoon in august try it some time
i missed two trains-but i got it

  he waved his hand toward an incon-
gruous brown-paper bundle that the bell
boy held bags were all checked at
the station before i got the line he

said so i had to bring it a la com-
muter

  been to dinner

  yes i ate in the pennsylvania sta-
tion

  youll come down and dance after
youve cleaned up i suppose dont
take the trouble to dress  lots of people
dance here in their everyday rigs you
know

 why-i guess so young parke
lowered his voice grinning a little self-
consciously as he asked a question  is
miss hartley here to-night

  the other laughed back sympatheti-
cally yes he replied no-hold
on he corrected himself she has
gone-not fifteen minutes ago wrent
home i had almost forgotten some-
body said now i remember that her
mother wasnt feeling quite up to the
mark

  wrent home eh thats too bad

i had sort of expected to--well

i guess ill go get some of the dust
off and take a little look around i
havent been here at forest gardens
for two years you know maybe ill
get back in time to tear off a couple
of dances before midnight

  he waved cheerfully and departed
behind the laden bell hop not more
than five minutes had elapsed before
he came down in the elevator nodding
to several acquaintances but not paus-
ing to greet them more than perfunc-
torily and passed quickly out of the
hotel people who observed his exit
said afterward that he did not stroll
down the street but set out hurriedly
like one who has a definite destination
m mind and is in haste to reach it

  at quarter after eleven doctor
ierrv eaton and endicott worth
wearied of watching the dancers de-
cided to take a short walk together be-
fore going to bed getting their hats
they went down the steps and headed
aimlessly away from the hotel

  at the second corner where lafay-
ette avenue bisected their street at
right angles they were conscious of a
man coming toward them running he
met them under a street light turned


the popular magazine

out without speech passed them and
then came to a sudden stop

  is that doctor eaton he called
uncertainly

 yes 

  he came back quickly they saw
an all-the-year-round resident of for-
est gardens whose face was slightly
familiar to the doctor he thought he
probably had seen the man on city-
bound trains it was a shocked wor-
ried face and flushed from unusual ex-
ertion

  doctor ade asked me to come and
get you he panted to eaton he
was at the inn earlier in the evening
and said i would find you there he
wants you to come as quick as you
can please there has been a-an ac-
cident or something a young fellow
named carruth-hes one of the tennis
players-we found him over here un-
der a hedge i guess hes dead

chapter it

a knotted cori

  he led the way back up lafayette
avenue dont run just walk fast
doctor eaton said as the man showed
signs of expecting them to return at
the pace at which he had come im
not built for running-and what time
i would gain by getting there id lose
getting my breath after i got there
when did this happen

  it was just after eleven oclock that
we found him the man replied my
wife and me he explained we wtere
coming home from a call on some
friends over the other side of town
we fairly stumbled over him it
wasnt but a block to doctor ades
house and i ran and got him and the
doctor and i took him over there
doctor ade is working on him but it
looks i guess as if it was all up

  an accident you say 

  i dont know it wasnt sickness
there was blood on one side of his
head over the ear not much just a
little looked to me more as if some-
body had laid him out

  they had come two blocks and were

passing jenney street a thoroughfare
that curved around past the big courts
of the tennis club and came out some
distance the other side of the inn it
was in this block that we found him
the messenger said in front of bol-
sters house the third one here on the
left right in the middle of the block
he was up close against the hedge
almost under it

  the block was a long one and the
electric lamps at the street corners were
of limited candle power theyr illumi-
nated each a little circle that did not
extend a hundred feet under the trees
bordering the curbs the middle of
the block could not have been much
darker if the town had been unlighted
it was a street of fairly pretentious res-
idences set back twenty feet or more
from the front line of the lots and
the inner edge of the sidewalk through
that whole block was marked by a
breast-high hedge of squarely trimmed
green the man who led them sheered
off toward the curb as he came oppo-
site where he had found carruth it
was as though he dreaded to step on
the spot where the boy had lain

  this is bolsters he said the
-he was right there

   he was alive when you found him i
take it doctor eaton said or doc-
tor ade would not have moved him
until after the coroner bad come

  the doctor was afraid he wasnt
but he wasnt sure but even if he
had been-even if he wasnt-doctor
ade could take him away doctor ade
is the coroner himself

  worth was impressed by the absence
of lights in the bolster house and those
adjacent nobody he said seems

to have been awakened mr-

  foster the messenger supplied
john b foster you turn off three
blocks farther to get to my house the
reason nobody is awake in these houses
mister is because there aint anybody
at home in them this is one of those
towns where a lot of folks come to
spend the summer while a lot of other
folks that live here in the winter go
somewhere else to spend the summer
where does mr grafton live
the buttons of bo bing



doctor eaton asked suddenly mr
james grafton

   in the next block on this side al-
most across the street from doctor
ade

  udid you know young carruth was a
guest at graftons 

  i didnt but doctor ade did he
was sending word over to grafton
when lie told me to rush down to the
inn to find you

  just ahead after they had crossed
another intersecting street was a large
bouse on the left centered in several
dots across from it they saw a little
knot of people standing very quietly
in front of a house on the porch of
which a small electric light illuminated
a brass plate that bore the name of
doctor ade bad news travels quickly
already notwithstanding the lateness
of the hour there were five men and
two women in the little crowd

   as the trio crossed the street a thick-
set middle-aged man went up the steps
and rang the bell thats chaffee
the chief of police foster whispered
they passed swiftly through the knot
of people and up the walk reaching the
door just as it was opened by mrs ade
to let mr chaffee in and entered with
him the chief who had a frayed
yellow mustache and displayed a shiny
bald head with a rim of tousled hair
as he removed his hat was perspir-
ing and perturbed

   a door at the right of the entrance
hrii stood open into the doctors office
and consulting room beyond the desk
that occupied its center doctor ade
a competent-looking man of thirty-five
stood talking to two other men on
the other side of the little group near
the farther wall an adjustable sur-
geons chair of leather and nickel was
thrown back to form a flat couchlike
surface and on it lay lee carruth
one glance was sufficient to inform
doctor eaton that his professional as-
sistance was not needed for the arms
had been folded across the breast

  doctor ade broke off what he was
saying to the two men as he saw the
newest arrivals and stepped toward
them

  im sorry doctor that i made you
so much trouble he exclaimed it
looked at first like a temporal fracture
and i thought perhaps an early opera-
tion might be necessary meanwhile
although there appeared to be complete
collapse there was a chance that arti-
ficial respiration would do some good
in other words i sent for help and
made most of the examination later
quite right of course doctor
eaton agreed having had much experi-
ence with what special attention doctors
and surgeons are expected to give the
rich he knew what criticism doctor
ade might have had to endure had a
highly skilled surgeon proved suddenly
necessary and not been summoned to
give his assistance he stepped over to
look casually at the body we saw him
less than an hour ago he remarked
he was dancing at the inn his ex-
pert eye noted a small wound over the
right ear violence he asked

  yes but not what i thought at
first that laceration of the scalp is
superficial there is no fracture death
resulted from strangulation

  do you mean to say he was choked
to death the chief of police de-
manded who did it he seemed
suddenly to repent of the excitement
displayed by this inquiry and smiled
vaguely about

  doctor eaton perhaps you have
met mr grafton doctor ade said
this is mr finch a friend of mr
graftons how do you do mr
chaffee this is mr chaffee doctor
eaton our chief of police you made
good time getting here chief

  came the minute i got your tele-
phone the chief puffed i was just
getting in my first snooze gee i
know i aint half dressed youll have
to excuse my looks

  manifestly the police official con-
fronted with a crime quite outside any
former personal experience was try-
ing hard to act as though solving mur-
der mysteries were his daily practice
he thought it would indicate inexperi-
ence if he showed the excitement he
really felt so he sought refuge in a
jocular hail-fellow-well-met careless-


the popular magazine

ness that some storybook detective or
other of his limited reading had pos-
sessed

  doctor eaton introduced mr worth
the others merely bowed their ac-
knowledgments but the chief thought
it necessary to continue his misplaced
affability

  glad to know you he cried he
turned to doctor ade this is a
pretty serious matter aint it 

  the doctor nodded gravely

  mr foster here was on his way
home with his wife when he came upon
the body he said he summoned me
quickly and we brought him here
there was the wound on the right
temple which you can see and in the
absence of further examination it
seemed quite possible that had done the
damage it is in a very dangerous and
quite often fatal spot he explained
to the laymen i sent mr foster in
a hurry to get doctor eaton within
two minutes after he had gone i made
a most surprising discovery i found
that a knotted cord had been drawn
tightly about the neck death had re-
sulted from strangulation it must have
been almost immediate

  from the top of his desk he took a
bit of heavy cord here it is gentle-
men he said please handle it care-
fully i removed it by cutting at a
considerable distance from the knots
you will notice those knots may give
us some inkling of howt it was done
and by whom please dont disturb
them

  in silence the five men examined the
fatal exhibit a the cord was
smooth and firm and of a size and
weight not far removed from that com-
monly used to fasten heavy express
packages it had been noosed and the
knots-there seemed to be two-were
peculiar so constructed that once the
cord had been pulled tight there was
little or no chance that it would slip

  this cord doctor ade said im-
pressively was so deeply imbedded in
the flesh that it was hidden and did
not show upon first examination if
i had not happened to see the knots
just under the ear i might have worked

on the patient an indefinite time before
discovering it at all

  how could a feller get those knots
tied without this boy having a chance
to holler  the chief asked practically
the way i understood it from what
mis ade told me over the phone there
didnt anybody hear any fight or any-
thing

  my theory doctor ade replied  is
that he was unconscious when the noose
was put around his neck the wound
on the temple would go to show that
he was rendered unconscious by a blow
-and then finished with the cord it
is only a theory of course what do
you think of it doctor

  plausible enough in the absence of
anything to the contrary doctor
eaton replied he bent over and
looked morecarefully at the wound on
carruths temple a glancing blow
such as this one was would probably
produce some concussion it would be
very likely to bring about temporary
loss of consciousness

  mr grafton struck at the heart of
the matter with the first remark he had
made but who would want tokill
that boy he cried why should any-
body have murdered him  what ene-
mies did he have 

  doctor ades gesture toward the
body was eloquent

  i fancy the cause is quite clearly
shown he said there is no money
whatever except less than a dollar in
small change in his pockets i imagine
he was in the habit of carrying con-
siderable sums

  a hundred or two anyway graf-
ton agreed perhaps more

  and there is no watch and you
will notice gentlemen that the buttons
have been cut out of his vest with
scissors i should say see  a v-
shaped cut where each of the four but-
tons was

  with an exclamation mr grafton
verified this perhaps the buttons
were gold or diamond-studded or some-
thing of that sort doctor ade went
on

  more valuable than that grafton
said he was wearing a set of antique
the buttons of bo bing



chinese buttons that were of very
great value indeed they were a set
his father picked up-william carruth
was a collector you know he showed
them to me at dinner to-night it was
the first time he had ever worn them
he said they were quite odd looking
although not particularly pretty and-
well i should call them a trifle-er-
loud

  james grafton known far and wide
as a patron of athletics-he annually
donated the forest gardens cup which
wras contested for on the tennis courts
-was equally famous as a dresser
to whom nothing could be more shock-
ing than the unconventional

  well ill have to get busy chief
chaffee declared briskly its murder
all right and the cause is as clear as
anybody could want robbery money
watch and vest buttons you say mr
grafton that these buttons were worth
a lot five hundred dollars maybe

  more likely five thousand grafton
said and chaffee gasped im guess-
ing at that you understand he added
ive never gone in for such things
and i dont know their value but lee
said to-night that his father valued
them very highly-and five thousand
or ten wouldnt have been a remarkable
price for his father to pay for an un-
usual possession of that sort lee said
they had a remarkable history he said
he would tell it to me some time
graftons voice shook a little as his eyyes
wandered again to the still figure
poor boy  piell never tell the storv

  was lie a relation of yours the
chief of police asked

  no a friend of my son  the were
at school together he has always
stopped with us when he came down
to the tournaments and this year i was
especially glad to have him earl being
awayr my boy is  the other side
you know-second lieutenant in the
officers reserve first and second
plattsburg camp w hen lee wrote me
that he was going into this years tour-
nament i told him by all means to
make my house his i was mighty glad
to see him the house is a bit lonee
i am a widower you know he had

been at the dance i suppose he had
just left there and was on the way
home i wonder how he happened to
leave so early

  the chief looked at doctor eaton
who had mentioned seeing carruth at
the inn for a reply to this

  a young lady had to leave early
he saw her home i think the doctor
said

  what young lady 

  miss hartley she lives on moly-
neux street if he went to her house
and then started for mr graftons he
would have come through jenney
street to the avenue here and passed
the point where the body was found
there was a sufficient margin of time
they left the inn at just about ten-
thirty

  i woncler if maybe she wouldnt
know something about it the chief
said i guess ill telephone her

  it would be considerable of a shock
to her wouldnt it mr worth
asked the question straightening up
from the adjustable chair where he had
been examining at close range the
slashed waistcoat where the buttons
had been removed

  i gotta do something-in a hurry
the chief said defensively there
must be clews somewhere i gotta get
em

  worth turned to mr foster who
had not spoken since they came into
the doctors office foster was greatly
shaken unconsciously he had been
wiping moisture from the palms of his
bands over and over again

  it is very clear lie said precisely
that the assault took place not more
than fifteen minutes before you stum-
bled over the body and if carruth
remained any time at all at miss hart-
leys not more than five minuses you
came up lafayette avenue from the
other side of town you sai  that
means you passed the railroad station
foster nodded

  did you meet any one this side of
the station-any one who might have
been hastening toward a train

  foster caught his breath by gra-
cious he said plow did i come not


the popular magazine

to think of it  this business drove
all the sense out of my head i guess
that mustve been the feller that did
it yes sir i bet he was the man and
that he was running to get a train
who where was he the chief
demanded

  about a block and a half this side
of the depot foster said he was
on this side of the street and my wife
and i were on the other side yes
sir he acted as if he didnt want any-
body to see him he kinda slid along
in the shadow of the trees and he
was breathing hard we could hear him
from across the street but i didnt
think anything about it i supposed it
was just some feller that was late get-
ting to a train foster was excited
and confused by the importance of his
recollection yes sir he again ex-
claimed that was him sure as
shooting he was kind of sputtering
and coughing too

  the chief leaned forward eagerly
did be get the train  he demanded

  i dont know i dont remember
hearing the train

  what time was it

  why i guess it was- hold on

i know i remember hearing the clock
on the first congregational church
strike eleven just after we came across
the track at the depot-about a block
this side it must have been about a
minute later or maybe two that this
feller wrent by

  two minutes past eleven wrait a
minute the chief with a word of
apology to doctor ade picked up the
telephone from the desk and gave a
number

  forest gardens depot he asked a
moment later this is frank chaffee
listen was the ten-fifty-eight to
new york on time to-night or late
thanks g-by

  it was on time so he didnt catch
it he said as he replaced the re-
ceiver that means he had to catch a
trolley or else he is still in town
gee i wish i had more men there
aint but four policemen on duty nights
not much chance any of em saw him
well- id better get out and start

em asking questions and get hold of
the trolley-company office to have them
ask conductors what kind of people got
aboard cars that left in that direction
soon after eleven a swell chance to
get anv results but i spose i better
do it

  im going to offer a reward mr
grafton said writh sudden resolution
it may help to make them remember
ill give a thousand dollars for the
evidence that will lead to the arrest and
conviction of the murderer

  chief chaffee beamed a thousand

- well that will help did you

see the feller mr foster  what kind
of a looking man was he

  i didnt see him at all-not close
enough to make him out  noticed
there was a man running toward us
on the other side of the street-noticed
him when he crossed the street ahead
under the light then we heard him
pass and he was kinda running in the
shade of the trees although he didnt
need to dark as these streets are and
the moon set moren two hours ago
its a wonder to me there aint dozens
of murders and holdups and things in
this town the way the town saves
money on street lights

  the chief defended the political or-
ganization to which he belonged
streets are light enough he ex-
claimed indignantly and its an or-
derly town nothing ever happens
here

  nothing but a murder in the heart
of the community mr worth re-
marked

  chaffee flared up we dont have
to have no city folks come down here
to tell us how to run the town he
snapped this may be a pretty bad
thing but it wouldnt have happened
if city folks hadnt gone around carry-
ing big rolls of bills and wearing vest
buttons worth thousands of dollars
maybe you can tell me what i ought
to do next different from what i said

  certainly was worths calm re-
sponse you ought to telephone again
to the railroad station and ask the sta-
tion agent if he was out on the plat-
form when the ten-fifty-eight went
the buttons of bo bing



through and if he saw any man board
it who was panting for breath and per-
haps coughing and who looked as if
he were trying to avoid observation
if he did perhaps you can get a de-
scription

  you talk like a fool the chief
snapped bluntly the train was on
time and this feller was still running
for it at two minutes pa eleven

  if he was trying to get it he caught
it worth retorted he was within
a block of the station two minutes after
your town clock struck eleven i hap-
pened to hear it strike-and looked at
my watch your town clock seems to
be run about as adequately as your
street lights and your night police pa-
trol at eleven oclock it was exactly
seven minutes fast

crossed wires

  for three seconds the chief showed
symptoms of exploding by internal
spontaneous combustion the angry
flush in his face spread up to his crown
and over and down to where the rim
of yellowish-gray hair came up from
the back of his neck he swallowed
once or twice then demonstrated that
he possessed a sound substratum of wis-
dom by recognizing good advice and
acting upon it he called the station
got the night agent to the phone and
wasted no words

 this is frank chaffee again
henry he said say were you
out on the platform when the ten-fifty-
eight left  and did any passengers
get on here what kind of looking
men  did you get a good look at both
of them    listen henry was
one of them blowin as if hed been
runnin for the train    which
one describe him can you did
he come from the lafayette avenue
end of the station     but you say
there were two together im lookin
for a feller that was alone whats
that which got there first did they
buv tickets did you hear em talk
   could you identify the cross-
eyed one if you was to see him again

   whats that about a dutchman 
oh the other one   yes henry
i want em but i cant stop to tell you
about it now ill be around to see
you after a while i gotta telephone
to town now what time does that
train arrive in the city 

  he put back the receiver and twid-
dled the hook impatiently up and down
hello he said after a second give
me long distance emergency this
is chief chaffee almost instantly
he was in connection with the long-dis-
tance operator chief of police
chaffee talking he said call to be
charged to police department get me
detective headquarters in new york
in a hurry im here at doctor ades
call me here

  he replaced the receiver and faced
the others in the excitement of the
moment he had forgotten his anger

  he caught it he exclaimed a
thin man about thirty years old me-
dium height with dark hair and very
cross-eyed he came up a-runnin two
minutes before the train come in all
out of breath and coughin looked like
a consumptive there was another
man already on the platform--henry
dont know when he came he was a
light-complexioned feller about the
same age talked like a german didnt
either of em buy a ticket probly had
round trips from new york the
cross-eyed man hurried up to the other
and the fellow that talked like a dutch-
man said vell  and the cross-eyed
one said nothin doin albert then
the german said nothin doin mit me
either i thought i had him but i
made a mistake and thats all henry
heard because they walked off together
down the platform and the train come
in they got aboard up near the head
end

  when you get new york worth
said it would be a good idea to sug-
gest that the police if they arrest either
of those men search them for manicure
scissors

 huh manicure-

  with a cutting blade-straight not
curved-not more than an inch and a
third long worth gestured toward


the popular magazine

the slashed waistcoat it is easy to
see that no long scissors did that and
a pair of scissors that does not register
exactly you will observe that they
cut more cleanly at the beginning of
each clip than at the end of it

  chaffee and the others examined the
edges of the vs where the buttons had
been worths grounds for his deduc-
tion were apparent enough now that
he had mentioned it

  a cross-eyed consumptive with
manicure scissors in his pocket the
chief of police repeated with satisfac-
tion it ought to be a cinch

  except of course that he may not
be a consumptive and might have had
intelligence enough to throw the scis-
sors away worth remarked dryly
they are not in that hedge where the
body was found or in the street there-
abouts i suppose

  by gracious we ought to search
that scene first thing chaffee de-
dared ill go right down there and-
take n look but i cant ive got to
wait here for the phone call

  he looked from one to the other as
though expecting some one to volun-
teer and mr foster did so with alac-
rity ill go right over if you say
so he said have you got one of
those electric flash lights 

  t have doctor ade said and
brought it from another room

  look all around the chief said im-
porkmlly as mr foster set out in
ih  b oge and back of it and in the
gutter and everywhere you cant ever
id where you might find some clew
or something in one of these mysteries
xo rat this is much of a mystery
i -t might be something about it
ve dout know tet

  he repeated himself as foster de-
pui the shuffle of footsteps in
of the house indicated that some
of the assembled neighbors were mov-
ing to accompany him on his belated
search for evidence  i guess thats
all we can do until we hear from new
york he said i hope they get the
conned ion in a hurry the trainll be
in first thing we know

  worth as they waited turned to

grafton you were at home i take
it nothing happened there that could
have any bearing t

  i had just got home when doctor
ade sent for me grafton replied
finch and i had just walked over
from the tennis club we had been
going over some odds and ends of de-
tail preliminary to the tournament
when we came to the house i asked
him to drop in and finish his smoke
mrs finch is awtay and we had just
settled ourselves in the library when
mrs ade came across and called me
i dont suppose we had been in the
house five minutes

  you came the most direct way from
the dub through jenney street and
lafavette avenue

  yes by george grafton stared
startled as the obvious deduction came
to him mr and mrs foster must
have been not more than a block or so
behind us when we turned into this
street the boy must have been lying
there when we came by

  but you didnt see him

  we were on this side of the street
dear me if we had been on the other
we might have discovered him sooner
and perhaps it would have been in

time-

  i hardly think so doctor eaton
said reassuringly

  the chief of police was not much
interested in this mere gossip he was
arranging in his mind the form of the
message he would want to give as hur-
riedly as possible to the new york offi-
cials when the telephone connection
should be made this form took shape
in his mind as a printed one such as
he was all the time receiving from other
busier police departments but never
heretofore had had opportunity to send
out-a circular with wanted for mur-
der in black gothic type at the top
and at the bottom the words  a re-
ward of one thousand dollars will be
paid for the arrest of the murderer
together with evidence sufficient to con-
vict franklin w chaffee chief of
police

  it is too bad you cant exactly de-
scribe those vest buttons he suddenly
the buttons of bo bing



grumbled theyre about as impor-
tant a clew as there is according to
my way of thinking i ought to have a
description of the watch and cuff but-
tons of course but i need a descrip-
tion of those vest buttons more

  i fancy if they are as valuable from
the standpoint of age and rarity as
mr grafton understood they were
they will be pretty familiar to all col-
lectors of rare jewelry mr finch
said most famous curios are well
known to a good many people

 but who who in forest gar-
dens the chief asked testily i aint
got time to run all over new york
looking for somebody that might be
able to tell me just what they look like
i ought to know to-night ive gotta
tell the new york police

  i imagine williams would know
about them doctor eaton said tenta-
tively to worth bayard williams
you know is living at the inn

  undoubtedly worth agreed chi-
nese buttons ought to be quite in wil-
liams line his specialty is asian and
african objects

  i guess i dont know this williams
chief chaffee put in who is he
summer visitor 

  fie was at the inn when i came a
little less than a month ago doctor
eaton replied i believe he lives in
new york winters and at various
cooler places summers-when he is
hereabouts he spends years at a time
traveling you know

  chaffee who didnt know tried to
look as if he did and is he at the inn
to-night  he asked could i find him
there now do you suppose 

  doctor eaton shrugged his shoulders
that i dont know he said i dont
recall seeing him this evening but that
does not prove anything there was a
big crowd at to-nights dance

  hes there grafton put in sud-
denly we met him on our way home
walking around the block for the air
i suppose you remember he added
to finch he wras just passing the
clubhouse as we came out

  finch nodded thats so i hardly
noticed him but now you speak of it

i remember he turned to chaffee
undoubtedly he was heading toward
the inn i have no doubt you will find
him there when you get time to look
him up

  any further discussion of mr bay-
ard williams or his knowledge of
asian curios was prevented by the ar-
rival of mr foster who came hurry-
ing up the steps and entered without
ringing he was somewhat breathless
and his eyes glistened with excitement

  what do you think of that he de-
manded

  that-which he put down on the
desk before the others with an air of
triumph-was an object about seven
inches long of the shape of a club or
billy as he dropped it on the desk
it thudded heavily its exterior was
of leather but every man present rec-
ognized it instantly for what it was--a
loaded slung shot of a most dangerous
variety

  chaffee pounced upon it

  thats what he hit him with in the
first place  he cried

  doctor ade took it from the chief
compared its shape and size with the
wound above the murdered mans right
ear and nodded undoubtedly he
said a glancing blow if it had
been a fair stroke it would almost cer-
tainly have fractured the skull that is
a very heavy weapon

  that makes it easier than ever ex-
claimed the chief anybody who car-
ries a thing like that in these days is
a professional there aint any doubt
about that at all a thug and a robber
-and its a cinch he followed this boy
down from newr york just to get his
v aluables it hadnt  ought to be so
hard to get the man weve got a lot
of things to go by when you come to
think of it his description including
the bad eyes and his cough and now
the fact that hes a professional id
bet you my salary for a year theyve
got that fellers picture that did this
in the gallery at headquarters

  nobody saw any reason to temper
the chiefs enthusiasm his confidence
and assurance grew as the evidence that
came to him demonstrated that after
	the popular magazine

all it was a case that would fail easily
into the routine variety with which po-
licemen are familiar he handled the
slung shot carefully hefting it and
measuring it with his eyes and visualiz-
ing again the description that he would
write for those reward circulars doc-
tor ade was the first one to speak ad-
dressing foster

  you didnt fin cl any scissors i
gather

  xo sir we looked in the street
and all through the hedge and in the
yard this blackjack was in the yard
quite a way hack from the hedge as
though the feller threw it when he had
finished his job of course manicure
scissors aint very large they may be
right there and get found later i left
several folks there with the flash light
searching i thought fd better hurry
right up here with this thing but i
dont think anything more will get
found to-night everything ought to
be gone over again the first thing in
daylight

  fll have it done right after sun-
rise chief chaffee said but i dont
figure we need to find those scissors-
although they might help some well
have the guy that did this mighty quick

and when we-

  what boast might have been  the
chiefs tongue was interrupted by the
ringing of the telephone bell doctor
ade answered it and after a word or
two silently pushed the instrument
across the desk to the chief

  headquarters  chaffee asked ex-
citedly this is chief of police
cbafee of forest gardens    for-
est gardens    xo not chief for-
estvdens-chief  of forest gardens
 -ong island    no no no say
whats the matter with this line no
i- not fong tslahd city say lis-
ten  theres been a lviurder down here

the feller that was killed was-

  a soft voice broke in to say opera-
tor

  im talking to headquarters he
cried youve cut me off and--
did you call them 

  no yes i put in the call but they
called-

  theres no one on the line excuse
it please

  the chief said certain things and re-
ceived no reply he slammed the re-
ceiver up on the hook and made it
dance another soft voice said num-
ber please he essayed to express
his emotions in one brief sentence and
failed i was talking on long dis-
tance he finally said lamely

  hang up your receiver and long
distance will call you the voice said
pie did so and looked about him red-
faced and congested with unspoken
words

  t a moment the bell rang and he
seized the phone again

  your party innew york doesnt an-
swer a girl said pleasantly

  dont answer what do you mean
dont answer do they shut the police
headquarters up for the night say
this is chief chaffee talking-an emer-
gency call i want new york police
headquarters and i want em mighty

quick if i dont-

  a brand-new voice came in from
somewhere seemingly at a great dis-
tance theres your party forest
gardens it said and as chaffee began
again to describe who he was and
where a resonant rumbling voice as
clear as though the speaker were talk-
ing from the next room said 

  ---so we makes the pinch and its

a jim hickey of a raid now the ser-
geant says for me to hit it back for

thoity-thoid street an-

  get off the wire demanded chaf-
fee unconscious that he shouted

  say grogan the same voice went
on theres some guy buttin in on this
line and i aint got no time to wait
the sergeant says that if youse will

send three men to-- there was a

click a buzzing a youthful ieminine
voice murmured  no honey listen 
how could i been dancin with him
when i aint been outa the house since

- then utter silence fell to be

broken by a cheerful

  are you waiting

  what chaffee said would have
caused doctor ades telephone to be
disconnected until he apologized to the
the buttons of bo bing



telephone management if they had
obeyed the rules

  he finally got a night manager at
the local exchange and conversed suc-
cinctly the night manager said there
had been a thunderstorm somewhere in
queens borough and they were having
a little trouble with the long-distance
wires they would do the best they
could but he was afraid he couldnt
promise very speedy service you see
for yourself how the lines are acting
he said blandly

  the chief hung up and looked at his
watch that train will arrive at the
pennsylvania station in just seven min-
utes he said and once these guys

scatter-

  feet pounded hurriedly on the walk
outside the house and came up the steps
and the doorbell rang sharply doctor
ade went to the door

  a gangling red-haired youth of
eighteen or thereabouts stood panting
on the step he wore the uniform of
a bell boy at the inn

  is chief chaffee here he panted
doctor ade nodded motioned to the
lad to enter and closed the door
chaffee had risen at the words and the
boy saw him

  say mr chaffee he sputtered ex-
citedly that is all true i spose what
they say down to the inn about mr

carruth bein-

  he saw the body behind the group
ol men and his voi-ce fell to an awe-
struck whisper gee aint that awful
an him slippin me a quarter less than

an hour ago when i-

  what do you want  chaffee com-
manded him sharply you didnt run
all the wray here just to make sure you
had heard a true report did you 
no the bell boy said no i
didnt mr chaffee no i didnt thats
right chief i didnt mr greenleaf-
mr greenleaf is the head night clerk
you know-mr greenleaf told me to
find you just as soon as i could and
over to your house they told me you
was here this here murderer hes
ordered a tourin car to make his get-
away to n yawk and mr greenleaf
hes fixed it with the garage so they

say they havent got one in just right
now but hes gettin awful anxious and
he might find some way to beat it if
you dont hurry

  who might  what are you talking
about  the chief shouted what
murderers tryin to get away 

  are they two the bell boy asked
confusedly i mean the one that
killed mr carruth he looked around
at the faces in the room mr alton
parke

chapter iv

theory and evidence

  it was the chief who broke the mo-
ment of startled silence alton
parke he exclaimed who the
blazes is he 

  why hes-mr alton parke the
bell boy replied hes down to the
inn hes-why hes just one of those
young fellers

  one of the tennis players doctor
eaton hastened to supply and i
think there must be some mistake you
dont mean to say--to the messenger
from the hotel-that he has confessed
that he committed murder surely he
hasnt otherwise he wouldnt be try-
ing to get away

  no sir he aint confessed he
dont even know that we know it
thats what mr greenleaf wants-for
mr- chaffee to come get him before he
finds out

  wait a minute the chief com-
manded let me get at this what
makes you think this parke did it  he
didnt confess well did anybody
see him 

  i seen him go and so did a lot of
others and i seen him come back
too the red-haired boy swelled with
a sense of unusual prominence it
was me that told mr greenleaf about
it--right after he come back and went
to his room and hollered for a tourin
car

  right after who came back told
greenleaf about what 

  mr greenleaf said youd better
hurry chief couldnt i be tellin you
as we went over
	the popular magazine

s

  ive got to know more than youve
told me before i go over come on
son your name is maxey aint it 
the bell boy nodded without trying to
conceal his gratification that the chief
should thus be able to identify him
get busy now and tell us what this is
all about you say you saw him go
go where 

  out to commit the deed it wtas
for jealousy love and revenge that he
done it

  the chief stared staggered the
others relaxed somewhat worth smil-
ing a little made a suggestion

  wouldnt it be a good idea to let
him start at the beginning-if there is
any-and unfold his tale gradually i
suspect his course of reading has not
been without its influence on this young
mans life

  chaffee without entirely appreciating
the point accepted the advice

  go to it from the start he said
tell all you saw this evening that
made you tell greenleaf you thought
this parke did it

  the bell boy took a long breath
beamed appreciatively on the most in-
telligent audience he had ever had in
his life and started in

  im on duty from six to twelve to-
night he said so im there when
mr carruth leaves the inn and im
there when mr parke gets there
when mr carruth leaves with miss
hartley he sends me to get his hat
when mr parke comes up in a taxi
from the depot it happens to be me
that juggles bis bas

  you mean hn vs a new arrival this

  ite come oil the ten-twenty so im
riht behind hin with his stuff when
he registers-two suit care- a bag and
a racouet ease and a package and i
hear him talk to mr italladay-and
thats the leadin clew

  yho is italladay 

  one of the y-oung fellers hes a
tennis player too pie ccraes over and
shakes hands and asks mr parke how
is he and mr parke says lies been
to dinner and that lies going to dance

as soon as hes washed up and then
he asks is miss hartley there 

  who asks

  mr parke asks mr halladay and
mr halladay says shes went and
mr parkes face falls at these tidings
an he says maybe hell be around to
dance by an by but first hes got some-
thing to do so he goes up to wtash
up but he dont-not thorough

  howr do you know

  aint i in the room with him hus-
tling his bags he just washes his
hands and dabs a little water on his
face and combs his hair and is all ready
to go before ive got the bags laid
out and the windows open and the
lights turned on in the bathroom
come on george thatll be all he
says an slips me a quarter and goes
right out when i go out and he goes
right out of the hotel and hustles like
hes in a hurry and its a cinch hes
goin over to miss hartleys aint it
well what else the chief asked
then just about eleven he comes
back i seen him the boys voice
fell almost to a whisper hes bunged
up and he comes in stealth-ly

  he repeated the word

  stealth-ly is the way he comes in
by the side entrance holdin a hand-
kerchief to his face like he trusted he
would not be reckernized an beatin
it for the elevator an he goes to his
room immediate and right away he
telephones to the office an says hes
decided not to stay and please make out
his bill for one night which he will pay
it and please have the garage send
around a tourin car to take him to
x yawk seein the last train has gone
and he finds he has to get there to-
night

  maxey stopped for breath then came
to his mouth-filling climax about
that time somebody brings word to the
inn of the crime that has been com-
mitted so then of course i know hes
the murderer that done the deed so
i tells mr greenleaf and hes stallin
the auto like i said but mr parke
has telephoned down to the office two
or three times and maybe if you dont
hurry he might get away
the buttons of bo bing



  none of the men doubted the bell
boys honesty for all his stilted lan-
guage his story carried the marks of
his own conviction the chief spoke
first

  what do you mean bunged up
hed been fightin or something
his clothes was all over dirt like he
had been rollin in the street and one
of his pockets was torn out like some-
body grabbed it in a scrimmage and
where he had his handkerchief up to
his face i think it was a swellin under
it maybe a black eye-although of
course that may have meant that he
was endeavorin to enter his room un-
discovered

  the chief weighed the story he
mopped his forehead wagged his head
and looked from one to the other of
his companions

  its an old saying that theres al-
ways a woman he said sententiously
he looked accusingly at worth if
you hadnt talked me out of it id have
called her up and found out what she
knew about it long ago it came to
him how many times in the past half
hour he had been influenced by worths
advice what business you got tell-
ing me how to run my business any-
way he demanded you aint no
sherlock holmes are you 

  doctor eaton spoke smoothly before
worth could reply

  mr worth is not a detective or
anything of that sort but he has hap-
pened to help in the solving of a num-
ber of fairly large criminal cases he
addressed himself more to the others
than to chaffee i imagine you gen-
tlemen are familiar with mr worths
writings-his articles deal with effi-
ciency problems especially as human
nature bears upon them he has as-
sisted the new york police commis-
sioner on a number of occasions it
happens also although he does not prac-
tice that he is a lawyer by profession
again he spoke directly to the chief
i hardly think you would go wrong
by taking his advice

 well-- said the chief grudg-
ingly but this woman-

  dragging -a young girls name into

a thing of this sort would be a pretty
serious matter worth said wouldnt
it be a good idea first to see what
young parke has to say for my part
-i know him only by sight and i
havent seen him for twro years-i
would want to hear his explanation
he turned to the bell boy has any-
body told him that carruth is dead
does he even know-so far as you are
aware-that a murder has been com-
mitted 

  aint anybody told him anything
dont he know it without tellin  why
he done it

  there you are worth said to the
chief

but i spose i better arrest him of
course i had ill go down there--
i dont want to give any advice un-
less it is desired worth said but

if you care for a suggestion--

  lets hear it said the chief adding
hastily i dont have to agree to take
it i do my duty as i see it

  naturally i was merely going to
suggest that before you actually make
an arrest it might be a fairly good
idea to ascertain why a boy with more
money in the bank than any young
man really needs should wrant to steal
a watch a roll of bills a pair of cuff
links and four waistcoat buttons and
i think if i were you i should like
to know whether he ever owned a
slung shot and whether he is in the
habit of carrying manicure scissors in
his pocket

  chaffee looked confused

  also doctor ade remarked tak-
ing part in this conversation for the
first time and lifting from his desk the
knotted cord whether he had any cord
of this unusual size in his possession
the bell boys eyes fell upon the ex-
hibit whose significance he could not
appreciate nor understand

  he did he cried thats a blue-
fish line i heard him tell mr halla-
day about it and while i was carryin
his things upstairs the bundle fell out
of my hand and busted and it was
full of string just like that he bought
it this afternoon in n yawk i heard
him say so


the popular magazine

  im going down to see what hes
got to say the chief announced with
decision by gracious  almost for-
got the long-distance call well- i

cant wait here when it comes have
em get me at the inn will you doc-
tor  ill be there for the present and
when i leave there ill let central
know he looked at doctor eaton
and his friend youll be going back
there anyway i spose if you want
to you can come along with me and
hear his story i bet if we go at it
right well get a confession and if we
do ill need witnesses

  i have already sent for an under-
taker doctor ade said professionally
as coroner i shall hold these things
safely-the cord the slung shot and the
cut vest-for production at the inquest
and later before the court if arrests
are made i told the undertaker to
bring a photographer-that probably
explains why he has not yet arrived--
to make a picture before the body is
moved i think it might be especially
desirable to have a photo that will show
that imprint of the knots under the left
ear

  endicott worth who had taken his
hat and was in the act of saying good
night to grafton finch and foster
looked up quickly

  the left ear he said

  doctor ade nodded

  so it doer worth looked quizzi-
cally into chief chaffees face and
made a comment whirh struck that
officer as intended to he smart but
meaningless 

  before i arrested young parke if
i were you i should also make some
inquiries as to which hand swings the
bat when he plays tennis and i
shouldnt entirely forget our cross-
eyed friend with the cough pie might
turn out to be left-handed

chapter v

  truths mixed witi untruths

  blotchy lights flickering like slow-
moving superfireflies hove ed ahead of
them as chaffee and the bell bov fol-
lowed by worth and eaton turned
from doctor ades house in the direc-

tion of the inn volunteers with their
own little searchlights had reenforced
the neighbors whom foster had left at
work in the bolster yard and the street
in front of that house they looked
to be searching quite unsystematically
but thoroughly if any other clews
were in the immediate vicinitv it
seemed a reasonable chance they would
be brought to light the chief crossed
the street and paused only long enough
to ascertain that nothing whatever had
been discovered since foster found the
slung shot then caught up with the
others after urging the men with the
lights not to give up until they bad
gone over every inch of street side-
walk and yard in the block

   he had been turning the newest de-
 velopments in his mystery over in his
 mind since young maxey told his story
 and he suddenly said over his shoulder
 to the pair behind him 

   this parke is a tennis player you
 said and so was carruth were they
 good ones rivals that way i mean
 very good doctor eaton replied
 possibly championship material both
 of them

   um-m-m  commented the chief as
 though this did not surprise him his
 next words showed the trend of his
 thoughts

   rivals in sports as well as for the
 same girl eh that might make it
 easier to account for

 tennis players do not have personal
 hard feelings against one another
 worth said

   i dont know replied the chief
 you cant ever tell sometimes these
 voung fellers that get all worked up
 over winning championships and so
 forth get pretty bitter about it t re-
 member once a murder in new york
 that grew out of two fellers goin a cter
 a boxing championship and one of them
 getting licked he just went out and
 figured if he couldnt get the other fel -
 ler one way hed get him another
 and once there was a couple of bil-
 liard players  heard-

  i gather youve never followed
 tennis much worth interrupted

   i certainly have not rejoined the
the buttons of bo bing



chief with emphasis some kind of
sports i know about-quite some but
tennis and golf i never got interested
in of course i get to the tournaments
every year  have to attend to the polic-
ing and all that  but i never watched
one of the matches way through i
cant say i even understand the points
of the game or that i want to

  i thought so well chief please
take my word for it that lawn tennis
doesnt develop the passions that cause
murders and i never heard of a ten-
nis player who was a desperate char-
acter

  well- the chief said the way

he said it implied that you never could
tell

  they seem to have stopped dancing
it isnt quite midnight is it doctor
eaton remarked as they approached the
inn

  they stopped it as soon as wrord got
around about mr carruth the bell
boy said the gentlemen they
thought seein as he had been dancin
there earlier in the evenin that it
wasnt any more than decent

  the chief paused-and they all came
to a stop with him we dont want
to go walking in like this in a body
he said or everybody will know some-
thing is up and i aint got any time
to talk to folks and answer questions
anyway you run ahead maxey while
we wait here and go in quietly and
ask mr greenleaf if parke is still up
in his room and then come back and
tell us if hes there well slip invthe
side door and you can take us right
up without anybody seeing us

  the boy was soon back he hasnt
come out he told chaffee excitedly
but hes been raising cain about the
tourin car an demandin that mr
greenleaf send to another garage or
somethin says it takes long enough
to get to jnt yawk at the best without
havin to wait all night before he gets
started

  has he said anything about the
murder has he been downstairs
no hes just stayed in his room
and cussed over the telephone

  come on the chief said uncon-

   i i

sciously easing his coat to have his
badge handy for exhibition you take
us up and knock on his door just as
if we were some guests you had showed
up to his room-and then you come
back downstairs

  neither doctor eaton nor worth
felt particularly happy at the part they
were about to play and yet it seemed
somewhat of a duty under the circum-
stances they probably were also in-
fluenced more or less by natural curios-
ity having seen so important a chap-
ter of the tragedy it was human to
want to know more they followed
maxey and the chief in silence for-
tunately they met no one who knew
chaffee by sight or felt well enough
acquainted with either of the others to
want to stop and discuss the evenings
happenings they came presently to
the closed door that bore the number
 the bell boy knocked lightly

   ell j a youthful voice called from
within ordinarily a pleasant voice it
was now distinctly harsh and irritable

  some gentlemen to see you mr
parke maxey called 

  i havent told the office to send
anybody up cried the boy i or-
dered a motor to go to new york
when is it going to be ready n
yes sir the gentlemen say it is
very important

  a mild swear word exploded and
parke strode to the door and threw it
open his left hand was holding a
damp towel to his cheek he peered
out over it at the three men failed to
recognize any of them and waited
holding the door for them to speak

  wed like to come in and talk to
you a few minutes chaffee said

  wthat about  i havent any time
you will excuse me but i am just leav-
ing if it is anything about the tourna-
ment i am not playing this year

  may we come in the chief asked
the boy patted the face with the
towel even with his back to the light
they could make out that there was a
discolored swelling on his cheek bone
why  he asked impatiently

  there are a few questions i would
like to ask you chaffee had devel-


the ppula magazine

oped a quite surprising suavity he
saw he would need to explain unless
he wanted to remain in the hallway or
push his way into the room my
name is chaffee i am the chief of
police of forest gardens

  it looked as though parke were go-
ing to expostulate then seemingly he
changed his mind he threw open the
door and gestured for them to enter
chaffee when the others had crossed
the threshold closed the door he
waited a second then opened it again
suddenly young maxeys shoulder
was leaning against the jamb go on
downstairs the chief commanded
beat it if i want you ill send for
you the bell boy beat it discon-
solately and the chief waited in the
doorway until he had disappeared
around a turn in the corridor return-
ing to the room and again closing the
door he also shut the transom

  parke in the meantime had re-
mained standing and had not spoken a
word now the chief turned to him
waving a descriptive hand toward his
companions i asked these gentlemen
to come up with me he said they
are interested in the-er-the matter
we want to talk about this is doctor
eaton this is mr endicott worth

  the boy showed no interest in the
surgeons name merely bowing with
an air of impatience at the other
introduction however he raised his
eyes quickly to his callers face with
a light of interest

  that is not a common name he
said are you the mr worth the
man who invented what they used to
call the worth stroke back in the
nineties 

  worth smiled and nodded not all
boys of twenty-five even among cham-
pionship contestants identified him
with the wrist stroke that he had made
famous chaffee did not give him any
chance to speak if he had wanted to
but looked parke in the eye in his best
police-station manner and said accus-
ingly 

  you know what i have come here
for

  worth thought the boy wras going to

show surprise and ask for a bill of par-
ticulars but he did no such thing on
the contrary after a second of hesita-
tion he said i suppose so

  well said the chief he was ob-
viously taken back himself by the reply
and could not think exactly what to
say next to his and the others sur-
prise the boy answered him by repeat-
ing the same word with the same rising
accent

  well 

  one gasping pause and then chaffee
again said it but this time with ex-
clamatory effect well and as
parke seemed to be more concerned
with holding cold water to his bruised
cheek than with the chiefs staccato
comment he went on what have
you got to say about it 

  nothing was parkes surprising
reply

  nothing it began to look as
though chaffee were going to act as an
echo for all the boys monosyllables
nothing but youve got to say
something-havent you  it was a
lame ending and the chief knew it but
he felt lame

  no i havent parke suddenly as-
serted it is my own personal busi-
ness and i dont care to discuss it
he gave me a black eye but im sat-
isfied i dont propose to have to stay
in this god-forsaken village so i
havent got anything to say at all if
you want to do any prosecuting youll
have to do it on your own hook

  well of all the nerve that i ever
see almost whispered chaffee see
here young feller do you realize that
this thing aint a joke you can tell
me where you were this evening and
what you did or you neednt just as
you please but maybe it will be better
for you if you speak up

  are you trying to threaten me
nothing doing

  the boys manner was not a manner
that fitted in with any of chaffees ex-
perience in dealing with lawbreakers
and he was sadly puzzled will you
answer me two questions  he asked

  i might if that would enable me
to get away sooner im beginning to
the buttons of bo bing



suspect chief that you are responsible
for my not getting an automobile all
right let em go but if you want any
details about my personal affairs it
wont do any good to ask excuse me
gentlemen if i seem rude but im in
a hurry and ive had a number of
things happen to me this evening that
have upset my temper a bit

  where did you get that bruise on
your cheek 

  you know darn well where i got it
or you wouldnt be here well i
havent anything whatever to say about
it as far as im concerned chief it
didnt happen

  gasping had by now become a habit
with chaffee but he was losing his
temper and he slammed out his second
question angrily

 where did you leave lee car-
ruth 

  to every ones astonishment chaf-
fees  less than the others the effect
of this sudden onslaught was instant
and staggering young parke forgot
the wet towel he was holding to his
swollen face and the hand that held it
dropped inertly to his side the blood
rushed into his face and then receded
leaving him pale he opened his mouth
to speak was silent wet his lips and
then said in an unnatural voice

 lee carruth leave him why
i dont think i have seen lee carruth
since the last tournament i played in
with him that was two years ago
every man present knew he was ly-
ing and the look in his eyes convinced
them that he realized it pie tried to
laugh

 why he said what has lee
carruthto do with it

  when you left this hotel this eve-
ning right after you had come in
where did you go chaffee demanded

  why i went for a walk just a
little walk around

  endicott worth sitting back in the
shadow tried to make out what it was
that had so changed the boy at first
he had been defiant but truthful so
far as he went nowt he was lying and
he was not an accomplished liar he
made bad weather of it

  were you on lafayette avenue
no the answer was prompt
worth believed it was the truth

  wrhere were you 

  why i walked around back of the
hotel past the tennis club and-and
then came home again and this
worth felt equally sure was not the
truth

  who did you see
nobody that is to say nobody i
knew he seemed to recover a little
of his earlier poise say he de-
manded are you beating around the
bush this way to get me to tell you
about the fellow that held me up  be-
cause i dont propose to tell ive ex-
plained the reason and it ought to be
good enough i dont propose to pros-
ecute him or to be held in this little old
town as a witness against him and if
you are depending upon me to convict
him you might as well let up because
i flatly wont

  worth leaned forward at this and
spoke across parke to the chief

  if you will excuse me he said
gravely i dont want to interfere in
your method of going at this matter
but i feel quite sure that you and mr
parke are talking at cross-purposes i
suggest that you tell him exactly what
has happened

  he knows whats happened well
enough growled chaffee hnd he
might as well come clean

  parke did not reply but there was a
growing look of trouble in his eyes

  you dont suppose you can get
away with it and leave town between
night and morning when its a matter
of murder do you the chief snapped

  murder  the emotion in the boys
voice might have been surprise or it
might have been fear is it murder
avhy-why of course ill stay if its
as important as that ill have to of
course

  he looked quickly at worth and
doctor eaton perhaps to assure him-
self from their faces that chaffee was
speaking truth then back to the chief
and then shot out a question that made
that officer blink whom did he mur-
der 


the cpopular magazine

 who did- the chief became

canny a young fellow over on
lafayette avenue

  all right said parke after a sec-
onds thought i wanted to get away
but i see i cant so ill tell you i
suppose you want a description and
you want me to identify him all right
he was a thickset chap not very tall
but strong-and with a deuce of a
punch in his right it was pretty dark
but i should say he was light-com-
plexioned and i think he had a little
mustache i think i felt it when we
were clinched he looked at chaffee
inquiringly is that the fellow  he
asked

  say what are you trying to do
chaffee demanded kid me if you
are ill admit you are trying to do a
good job but i dont kid easy come
clean now and tell me the straight
of it

  im not trying to kid you parke
protested it was this way i was
out taking a little walk i was-i was
just beyond the tennis club in a dark
spot when this man jumped out at me
from behind a tree i had no suspicion
that he was there and he got me before
i had a chance to do a thing he
grabbed me by the throat and punched
me-a glancing punch that didnt do
any harm i thought it was a straight
holdup for robbery but afterward i
thought different he said only one
word-sort of exclaimed it as he
grabbed me the word was swine

  the fight didnt last long but it was
a good one while it lasted i got my
right arm clear and let him have one
under the heart and he grunted as if
it hurt him and loosed his hold and
 sprang back and made a pass at him
and he landed some sort of a hook i
guess it was and i went down he
patted the bruise on his face he
kicked at me as i fell but didnt land
and i got hold of one of his feet and
threw him then we rolled around a
bit and by and by i got a pretty
fair punch in on his neck and we came
apart and both jumped up we were
out in the middle of the street then
and there was more light but i couldnt

get a good view of his face because
his back was to it and then suddenly
he got enough and turned and ran and
i came back here to the inn

  he shrugged his shoulders i had
to get to new york-at least there was
a matter that made me in a hurry to
get there-and i didnt want to be held
here as a witness so i made no report
of it and didnt intend to and there
you are well 

  chaffees look might be described as
one of severity tempered by admira-
tion

  a good one he exclaimed as
good a one as i ever heard in my life
but of course youve had quite a long
spell to think it up now that youve
got it off your chest come on with the
truth

  you mean you dont believe---

  oh cut out the bluffin kid it
dont go im too old just where did
you say this happened 

  just beyond the tennis club

  on what street

  jenney street of course

  on which side of the street
the east side the side nearest the
clubhouse

  chaffee allowed himself a grim smile
there isnt a tree on that side of
the street in the whole block he re-
marked

  parke caught his breath paled and
was silent

  now tell the truth the chief said
stubbornly and not entirely uncon-
vincingly the youth replied i have
told the truth

  this thug that jumped out at you
from behind a tree where there aint
any trees only spoke once and then
he said swine did you ever hear any-
body-anybody real-say swine when
they were mad 

  certainly ive heard it quite a
number of times during the last year
fritz always says it

  fritz

  i drove an ambulance a while over
on the other side parke said modestly
and thats what i meant when i said
that afterward i thought maybe this
wasnt just a holdup i thought maybe
the buttons of bo bing



it was a german that had it in for me
for working in france he sort of
looked like a german of course
swine is almost the same in both lan-
guages i didnt have time to figure
out his exact shade of pronunciation
he smiled faintly

  during this explanation the chiefs
eyes had not lefl parkes face now
he shook his head positively not a
chance to get away with it he ex-
claimed not a chance

  the light of trouble in the boys eyes
grew deeper he hesitated then asked

this young fellow over on- is lee

carruth living at graftons again this

year  i dont suppose- he

stopped

  what makes ou ask that 

  why you mentioned carruths
name you asked me when i saw him
last and if he is stopping at graf-
tons that is on lafayette-

  how did you know he was here in
forest gardens this evening at all  no-
body told you before you went out for
your walk did they

  no i just- it only came to

me because you mentioned his name
when they told you dowmstairs
that miss hartley had gone home did
anybody mention that carruth went
with her

  why no no then not sin-
cerely did he

  chaffee leaned forward and de-
manded bullyingly

  what do you know about the death
of lee carruth

  then it was- nothing except

what ive told you about the fellow
that attacked me the significance of
the chiefs question seemed to sink in
more fully why you dont mean to
say you believe that i could have any

knowledge of- you say he was

nymdered  how

  chief chaffee pointed to a waste-
basket in which was a large crumpled
piece of brown paper what was in
that paper  he asked

  fishline was the prompt answer
  where is it

  in my suit case i bought it in
the city this afternoon and my bags

were checked at the station so i
couldnt put it in when i decided-
when i had to get ready to go to new
york to-night i stowed it away in the
bag

  open the suit case i want to see
it

  parke looked toward the row of bags
that he had set on the floor pending
the arrival of a porter to take his lug-
gage to the automobile his eyes
searched the faces of doctor eaton and
worth what he saw there seemed
to confirm thoughts that were running
in bis mind

  see here he exclaimed i dont
just understand this you arent claim-
ing that i- you dont think that i

had anything to do with- nobody

spoke and he blurted you act as
though you suspected me of being con-
cerned in this-death do you 

  i havent said we do replied the
chief why dont you want to let
us look at that fishline

  for reply parke took out his bunch
of keys and opened a suit case stowed
in one corner was a bulky oval of
heavy twine wound as large fishing
lines are usually wound about a stick
apparently the quantity totaled at least
two hundred feet

  chaffee took the twine in silence and
looked it over then passed it to worth
and eaton it was manifestly of about
the same size and weight as the knotted
exhibit they had so recently left lying
on doctor ades desk they passed
it back to the chief

  where did you get this chaffee
asked

  at the uptown store of the mays 
tremley company why  what is
the idea  what has fishline to do
with--

  may i cut off a few inches

  why i dont see- certainly if

you want to

  you havent any scissors have you
your manicure scissors would do

  i havent any scissors

  well i can use my knife the
chief slashed six or eight inches from
the end of the fish cord put it carefully
in his pocket and tossed the remainder


the popular magazine

on the bed why did you buy this
cord to-day 

  im going fishing right after the
tournament and i wouldnt have time
to get any

  how is that seeing you aint going
to play in the tournament and was go-
ing back to new york to-night

  i didnt know i was going back
when i bought the line something
came up afterward

 what

  parke hesitated a second if youll
excuse me he said i cant see why
it should concern any one but myself
it is a personal matter

  telegram or telephone you got this
evening or something like that

  purely a personal matter the boy
repeated

  i see well well pass that up
why did you bring this fishline along
with you instead of having it sent
on to wherever it is you were going
fishing 

  the fishing party is from new lon-
don i didnt send it because i wasnt
sure it was exactly the right size the
clerk had never had any experience in
bluefishing and he said he thought
there were two sizes used but he didnt
know which was the favorite so i
took it with the understanding that i
could exchange it anr decided to write
thompson-that is the friend with
whom i was going fishing--to see if
it was the right size if he said it
wasnt i would have the line here to
return

  where is thompson now

on his boat at bar harbor
you wouldnt have much time to
reach him and get an answer before he
sailed foi new london would you
i was going to mail him a sample
to-night

  oh you cut off a sample then
this bunch here will total what you
bought less the piece you cut off

  no they gave me an odd bit at
the store

  when did you mail it

  i didnt

  you just said this thompson is the
friend that you was going fishing with

why was  have you given the trip
up

  i hadnt quite decided there was

a chance i might not be here i-

to tell you the truth i have been
thinking a little of going back to
france

  the chief looked shrewdly into
parkes eyes and spoke forcefully i
want to see that odd piece of twine that
the clerk in mays  tremleys gave
you

  i cant see why you- should want
it parkle exclaimed and i dont un-
derstand this whole- business will you
be good enough to tell me what you are
driving at

  i want to look at that piece of
twine

  say mr worth is this all right
the youth appealed to the one whose
face perhaps seemed most sympathetic
among those in the grave triangle i
dont know why this man should come
up here and put me through a cross-
examination like this if you gentle-
men think i know anything about a
crime thats been committed-and its
pretty plain you do from the way you
act-oughtnt i to have some advice
or something

  as i came here at mr chaffees re-
quest worth replied seriously i do
not think it would be proper for me
to advise you

  you can have this advice the chief
put in youre entitled to it you
dont have to answer questions that will
incriminate yourself-if that is your
reason for not answering them

  it is not parke declared hotly
there isnt any reason why i shouldnt
be willing to tell you whatever you ask
--but i think i am entitled to know
what you are getting at as to that
piece of fishline-i havent got it
you havent got it and you didnt
mail it chaffee exclaimed trium-
phantly where is it

  i dont know i had it loose in
my pocket and when i changed my
clothes after i came in-the ones i was
wearing got all messed up in the fight
-i noticed it was gone it was in a
side pocket and the pocket was torn
the buttons of bo bing



  lost it in the fight eh

  i suppose so

  if we gc out and look do you think
maybe well find it where the man
j umped out at you 

  perhaps

  on jenney street just beytond the
tennis club where there aint any
trees 

  something in this question disturbed
parke more than anything since the
first mention of carruths name

  i-i suppose so he stammered
that is to say it ought to be there
but of course  dont know where i
lost it it might have been somewhere
else

  where else were you 

  i told you i walked from here to
there and back that is all just from
here to there and back or i-i might
have lost it on the train-or some-
where

  the wall telephone rang sharply and
parke answered it

  yes he said and turned to chaffee
they want you

  hello called the chief say
wait a minute hold them until i can
get into a booth about two minutes

  he replaced the receiver hastily it
is my new york call at last he said
ph go downstairs and talk with
his hand on the doorknob he fixed an
uncompromising gaze on young parke

  leland carruth has been mur-
dered he said i dont think i need
to tell you where or how at least i
aint goin to i want you to stay
right here in your room until i tell
you you can leave it have your break-
fast tip here if you havent heard from
me ive got some investigations to
make and when ive made em well
decide what to do next for the pres-
ent well put it that i want to hold
you as a witness

  he opened the door and motioned
to doctor eaton and worth to precede
him

  do you mean to say- i have been
arrested parke demanded

  no the chief replied no you
aint been arrested but you will be

if you try to stir a step out of this
room either into the hall or down a
fire escape

chapter vi

a shadow in the dark

  the trio had come to the elevator
and chaffee was pressing a nervous
finger on the button before any one
spoke then doctor eaton address-
ing worth murmured

  well did he do it

  probably not

  what makes you sayr that  chaffee
demanded testily

  several things pie doesnt act
guilt one of the principal causes for
suspecting him was the evidence that
he was in a fight and he has explained
that-fairly truthfully

  how do y-ou make that out i tell
you there aint a tree on the east side
of jenney street in the whole block
oh he lied about where the fight
took place-but his other details were
true you know that

  i dont know any such thing mov-
ing shadows in the elevator well indi-
cated the approach of the car sounds
to me like a cock-and-bull story all
this talk about a feller that hollered
swine and jumped at him this is a
quiet town theres mighty little chance
there could be two fights on the same
night at the same time mighty little
chance besides why should a man
want to jump out at this parke the
way he savs he did j

  he didnt pie intended to j jtmp
out at somebody else-probably car-
ruth at least that was his own ex-
planation

  his own-- what do you mean 
who told you it was

  the elevator arrived and the door
slammed open

  you did worth replied too low
for the operator to hear as they filed
in your friend at the railroad sta-
tion told you the german who took
the train said i thought i had him
but i made a mistake werent those
his words r

  chaffee was silent while the car
dropped his mind was having trou-


the popular magazine

be with this new viewpoint thats
sohe agreed uncertainly as the eleva-
tor came to a stop but the other fel-
ler-the cross-eyed one-said noth-
in doin too how do you explain
that

  i dont you will have to ask him

 but- looky here if this

parke had a fight with a dutchman
like he says he lied about where it
was

  undoubtedly

  well why why tell me that

  i cant because i dont know are
you going to need me any more chief
because if you are not it is after half
past twelve and midnight is my usual
bedtime

  no i dont think so chaffee said
ill probly need to call on both of you
after ive had a chance to compare
that piece of twine with the one that
choked him to connect the string i cut
off with the piece i cut it off of un-
til then i dont see as you can help any
more

  they were coming from the hallway
in which were the elevators into the
wide lobby and his eyes circled the
loom

  thunder  he exclaimed i might
a known that bell boy couldnt keep his
mouth shut look at em every-
bodys up and waitin for the latest de-
tails

  notwithstanding the hour the lobby
was filled and through open doors it
could be seen that large groups lin-
gered on the piazzas it seemed as
though fully one-half the dancers had
remained to await developments many
of them had not known carruth even
by sight yet they felt a personal in-
terest in the tragedy whose perimeter
they had for a moment touched an
atmosphere of restraint was evident
occasional bursts of laughter were
speedily controlled and for the most
part the people were conversing in low
tones

  over on the long seat that served
as a mourners bench for the bell bovs

j

the fiery head of the sensation-loving
maxey was nodding emphatically as
he told to two other boys some detail

of his evenings experience perhaps
for the hundredth time it would not
be dignified for guests to hobnob with
bell hops but two or three were stand-
ing carelessly within a few feet of the
bench trying to look as though they
were not listening to whathe said with
all their ears

  at the desk a knot of men sur-
rounded mr greenleaf the chief night
clerk a young man with pale hair and
tortoise-rimmed spectacles of the type
which never lets a bit of scandal die
for lack of willingness to pass it along
in strict confidence to all-comers mr
greenleaf was speaking seriously and
confidentially worth wandered how
many groups had thus gathered to get
the story at intimate firsthand since
maxey brought down the thrilling in-
formation that the chief of police and
his companions had entered room three
hundred and sixteen

  chief chaffee hurried across the
lobby toward the alcove which held the
telephone switchboard and booths try-
ing not to look as important as he felt
doctor eaton drew worth back into
the hallway

  im going away from here he ex-
claimed look at them-and fifty of
them know me if i were to walk out
into that lobby i would become a cen-
ter of attraction like unto an early-
christian martyr im going to bed

  worth smiling hurried with him to
the elevator it is a wise thought
he agreed i dont think i have many
acquaintances there but that probably
wouldnt make any difference lets
allow chaffee all the power and the
glory

  they stopped a moment to talk in
the corridor of the second floor wthere
both had rooms

  is this a simple problem or a com-
plicated one the doctor asked an
ordinary holdup or a cause celebref i
wonder

  i refuse to worth replied i
came down here to get a weeks vaca-
tion and see tennis matches i refuse
to take other peoples worries on my
shoulders it is chaffeesbusiness  let
him do it he shook his head seri-
the buttons of bo bing

j 

ously i hope they dont make that
parke boy any more trouble than he
legitimately has coming to him he
seems like a nice boy but he oughtnt
to lie and he did lie of course he
didnt have that fight on jenney street
and he did see lee carruth to-night
did it occur to you that in some
manner he might be trying to protect
miss hartley

  wgrth nodded that could be an
explanation well old man pepys gave
us the advice that applies right now-
and so to bed if and when the new
york police get the cross-eyed man and
his german friend things may be
solved very speedily police make a
lot of talk about studying the motives
for crimes before making arrests but
it is my observation that most mys-
teries are solved by arresting the right
men and ascertaining the motives after-
ward

  they said good night

  in his room a few moments later
worth removed his coat and vest and
then one shoe very slowly he sat
holding the shoe in his hand while his
mind reviewed some of the events of
the evening out of the last sentence
he had spoken to doctor eaton a
thought came back to him with a trou-
blesome feeling that in some manner
he had not followed it to the conclusion
he ought

  motive he said to himself mo-
tive two men lay for carruth one

is a german now what motive-

  the elusive conclusion came he
recalled the news item in the morning
papers that could be it he de-
cided id better suggest to chaffee
in the morning that he ask the city
police to look over their lists of pro-
german pacifists there have been
cases where interrupters of the soap-
box meetings have been assaulted after-
ward near their homes perhaps i
otight to get word to him to-night it

might-

  the ringing of his telephone bell
broke in upon his meditations he
dropped the shoe and crossed the room
to answer it

  is this mr endicott worth in-

quired a feminine voice to his rather
abrupt hello it was a youthful
voice he thought with distinct evi-
dences even in only four spoken words
of culture and good manners

  yes he replied

  i hope you will excuse me for call-
ing you so late the voice went on
and he noticed that it was a somewhat
shaky voice certainly nervous and per-
haps frightened you have never met
me or even heard of me probably but
my father used to speak of you i am
grace hartley

  yes miss hartley worth replied
your father and i were very good
friends i saw you this evening at the
inn-doctor eaton pointed you out to
me

  then perhaps you wont think it so
outrageous if i- i am terribly wor-
ried mr worth i ought not to an-
noy you of course i must ask advice
of somebody at once to-night
and doctor ade mentioned that you
had helped people sometimes getting
at the bottom of-of things that are
mysterious he said you were a law-
yer too doctor ade just left here
mother was so overcome at the news
that i had to send for him

  are you at home 

 yes a friend telephoned my
mother from the inn about-what has

happened it made her ill and i-

i must see some one whom i can trust
and mother isnt well enough to advise
me and i remembered what father used
to say about you and- i am ask-
ing a great deal but could you come
and see me  i would come to see you

if i could of course but-

  i understand it isnt very late
after all miss hartley i have only this
minute come to my room i should
think i could get to your house in five
minutes or ten your mother is there
i suppose

  yes we are on molvneux street
you know-the first street after you
pass the tennis club in the third block
from jenney it is a lot of trouble
i am asking you to put yourself to
i know but--


the popular magazine

  no trouble at all worth inter-
rupted ill be right over

  thank you so much i will have
the piazza lighted so you will find the
house easily

  worth thoughtfully retrieved his
shoe and put it on resumed his vest
and coat and picked up his hat he
glanced at his watch remembering with
a sigh of gratification that to-morrow
being sunday to-day rather he could
sleep as late as he wished switched off
the lights went down by the staircase
and passed quietly out of a side en-
trance

  miss hartley opened her front door
herself at the sound of his feet upon
the steps before he had time to ring
it was so good of you to come she
said sincerely it is such an impo-
sition for me to ask you

  he followed her into a tastefully fur-
nished living room whose lights with-
out being too brilliant were sufficient-
to enable him to appraise her ade-
quately while he was saying the polite
things etiquette required and taking
the chair she indicated

  miss hartley he thought was a bet-
ter-looking girl in the clothes she now
bad on than in the pink evening gown
she had worn when last he saw her
it was a simple house dress that she
now wore a dress of the blue gingham
that even the best-gowned girls in the
great city went in for in the summer
of  he observed that she had
intelligent attractive eyes a good com-
plexion and an abundance of dark hair
she went at the heart of her business
with him directly it was a habit she
had inherited from her straightforward
father he thought

  you left doctor ades office with

mr chaffee he told me has- did

air chaffee arrest alton parke
no worth assured her that is
to say he has not done so yet it is
true however that mr parke is under
surveillance he is not allowed to
leave his room

  then why- they told me at the

hotel switchboard his room did not an-
swer

  perhaps by instructions of the

chief worth said he might want
to prevent people calling him on the
phone although of course parke
may have given such orders himself

  mr worth the girl said and the
only evidence of the difficulty she felt
in approaching the subject was in her
beginning the sentence with his name
all my life when my father was liv-
ing i went to him with my troubles

my mother is- she is not very

well i have never made a practice of
going co her for advice she could not
help me as papa could

- worth with a mental picture of a
frail woman who would be a broken
reed to lean upon in times of stress
bowed sympathetically

  it is odd that i should send for you
to-night when i have never met you
but doctor ade was telling me after
he had given mamma some quieting
medicine of your being in his office
and that he thought you did not believe
alton-mr parke-had anything to do
with what happened and he said doc-
tor eaton spoke of you as a man who
had helped get at the bottom of things
and mentioned that you were a lawyer
and i knew right away that you were
the man who used to know my father
because vou were down here for the
tennis

  i guess it was mostly impulse that
made me call you she went on but
father told me more than once about
the time he beat you at newport and
a man who would do what you did in
that last set must have been the squar-
est kind of a man he always said it
was the sportingest thing he ever sawr
done

  pm afraid he exaggerated i dont
remember anything of the sort it was
a hard match i recall and a very close
one but he outplay ed me

  so the minute i heard -our name it
seamed to me you would be just the
man to advise me you would do it
honestly i knew will you because
you knew my father 

  i think i would if i never had
known ur father having known
him nothing would give me greater
pleasure
the buttons of bo bing



  why do they think alton parke
had something to do with-with what
happened to-night  she asked

  there are several reasons he re-
plied personally i do not think any
of them are very convincing

  the lady who woke mamma up to
tell her about it at midnight said alton
left the inn to come to this house soon
after i had left the dance and that he
returned at eleven oclock with a bruise
on his face and sent for a car to go
to the city saying he was not going to
stay for the tournament is that true 
yes he explains the bruise how-
ever by saying that a man assaulted
him-sprang at him from behind a
tree

  alton and i have been friends for
a long time she said a number of

years we have- well- a

slight flush crept up into her face but
she looked into his eyes steadily we
have not been engaged or anything but
we have corresponded and in a letter
that i received yesterday he said he
wanted to be sure to see me when he
arrived here at forest gardens to-
night  because he had something im-
portant to say to me-something he had
been keeping to himself during all the
year and more he has been away i-i
was looking for him all the evening
at the inn and i thought he was not
going to arrive until to-morrow but
if he did get in and it wasnt too late
he said he would come to the house
and it seems he started to why didnt
he could he have met lee carruth

and- i dont meap in cold blood-

alton couldnt do that of course-but
accidentally in a fight or something
did doctor ade tell you just how
carruth came to his death 

  no something about a blow on the
head he wouldnt speak much about
that i suppose it wouldnt be profes-
sional

  it isnt necessary to go into details
but i think i can safely say that who-
ever committed the murder intended to
do so

  then it couldnt have been alton

of course but i-i was worried for
fear--

  if there is something you havent
told me and would like to- sug-
gested worth shrewdly

  i never knew lee carruth to act
just as he did to-night she said low-
voiced we stood there in the door-
way and he was going home and he
asked me when i was going to decide
to marry him he had said that be-
fore it was-she tried to laugh-a
sort of habit with him i had never
taken it seriously and i always told
him it was all nonsense but to-night
after he had said it again and i had
tried to laugh it off he-he kissed me

  there was a little catch in her voice
dont think i am trying to tell you
mr worth that none of the boys have
ever kissed me before but this was-
different he was rough and at first
i thought i would struggle but that
meant-well of course it wouldnt do
to make a scene about it so i just
stayed perfectly still until he let me
go and then i told him he had for-
gotten himself and that i shouldnt
marry him and he must never do it
again and shut the door and he wtent
away

  worth was old enough to be the girls
father but he was a bachelor and the
intimate confidences of young ladies
of twenty-two had never come his way

  wait she said that isnt all of
it at least i am afraid it isnt it came
to me aftenvard that at the moment
when he-when he was kissing me a
shadow moved under the trees across
the street a house or two down there
was no light on the piazza but there
was one-not a very bright one-in the
hallway behind us whoever was
across the street might have seen

  it did not seem to worth that any
great harm would have been done even
if this were true

  and it might-when you figure that
alton left the inn ten minutes behind
us and that we had been talking there
in the hallway just about ten minutes-
it might have been alton

this is no time for complacency or sitting back ex-ambassador gerard
has given us a fair idea of germanys intentions and feelings toward the
united states and what we might expect if germany were to win the
war the united states must beat germany if it is to remain free and
unthreatened to win the war the united states needs not only men-it is get-
ting the men by the draft-but money everybody in the country ought to dig
down and help with the present liberty loan it will hurt no one to do without
something or other in order to save a little and there is no better guardian of
your savings than uncle sam more important than this if the blood and sac-
rifice of americans already over there is not to be in vain and if america
is to live fearlessly as the great land of freedom and opportunity the present
loan must be a big success it is up to you to make it so it is your duty to
buy a bond of whatever denomination and in whatever way you can afford any
bank will tell you how if we knew of stronger and more emphatic ways of
saying this we- would gladly devote pages to it its the most important thing
we know of just now

if free trade were universal

    umber three of president wilsons famous peace terms in which
i	he advocates the removal of economic barriers between nations has set

       many of our political economists and business men thinking for in this
item of his program he brings up the old uneasy question of protective
tariff which in the past has been so motive of bitter opposition and long-drawn
discussion

    fundamentally it cannot be denied that the protective-tariff theory of trade
is and will continue to be one of the chief underlying- causes of war as long as
it is maintained ilased on selfishness and suspicion in its verv nature it is fruit-
ful of ultimate evil and it is perhaps owing to this economic fallacy more than
to any other single motive that the german welt mac lit odcr niedergang is due
for believing in the commercial dictum that trade follows the flag the teutons
have pursued the ancient method of conquest to do away with economic barriers
how much nobler it might have been had germany in her desperate seeking for
markets and supplies agitated and led in the idea of international free trade 
caught in the net



     of course we recognize the difficulty and undesirability of throwing open the
market of a country to competitive manufacturing agencies that undersell and
make useless the labors of its own people but at the same time it is not imprac-
tical to suppose that in due course the economic balance would adjust itself
inasmuch as each country produces-its own peculiar genius and resources which
would find adequate exchange especially under international agreement and
law

    great britain seventy-five years ago faced an economic condition similar to
that of germany prior to the present war but she had the wisdom to overturn
her commercial and fiscal policy which resulted in free trade on the subject
we must quote for you what the great advocate of this change william cobden
once said in a powerful address to parliament

    i have been accused of looking too much to material interests nevertheless i can
say that i have taken as large and great a view of the effects of this mighty principle as
ever did any man i believe that the physical gain will be the smallest gain to humanity
i look farther i see in the free-trade principle that which shall act on the moral world
as the principle of gravitation in the universe-drawing men together thrusting aside antag-
onism of race and creed and language and uniting us in the bonds of eternal peace   
i believe that the desire and the motive for large and mighty empires for gigantic armies
and navies will die away i believe that such things will cease to be necessary or used
when man becomes of one family and freely exchanges the fruits of his labor with his
brother man

    there is room for serious and momentous thought in these words

business training for boys

a unique departure in commercial training is the school for office boys
opened in november by the chicago public-school system

most of us when we speak of the office boy have a hazy mental
picture of a combination pecks bad boy and fresh imp this is no
doubt the work of newspaper funny men who form a standard from the gutter-
snipe copy boys infesting the average newspaper office

    the office boy of the stage has been a like caricature one of our promi-
nent comedians-james t powers if we remember rightly-started climbing
the ladder in the title role of the office boy which depicted the youth in ques-
tion as a prankish pest who made his exit whistling smoking cigarettes slam-
ming doors and executing a few buck-and-wing steps

     the office boy of reality has been and is a really important function of mod-
ern business we read now and then of newly appointed railroad presidents
and trust heads who began as office boys in fact the majority of us who have
come up through the overhead branch of industry have all been office boys in
our turn

    it is the first step in business management and the importance of guiding
this first step properly was fully appreciated by the hundreds of chicago business
men who wrote their enthusiasm and suggestions to assistant superintendent wil-
liam m roberts who heads the new field of instruction at the head of five hun-
dred pupils these include entirely green hands at the game and another batch
of boys already in offices who will devote a few hours each day to learning how
to rise

     in calling at general offices these days especially in large businesses which
no 	the popular magazine

operate from an administration building- we are rather surprised at the business-
like air of the boy who takes our card he is an important individual-the first
point of contact with the public it is in his power to make our initial impression
of the business one of irritation or good will

    this modern office boy-frequently replaced by the branch telephone oper-
ator who by the way has her special department in the new chicago school-is
well dressed and almost overcourteous or he doesnt last long he is the aid-
de-camp of the general within the private office the go-between who conveys
your card and message and much depends on his observations and analysis
whether you get an audience or not

    when you enter you find him revising and checking up mailing lists filing
correspondence or addressing- envelopes for direct-mail campaigns all three of
these functions require thoroughness and skill and genuine responsibility follow
the average office boy about and you will be struck with the evident care exercised
in his selection for he daily goes to the bank intrusted with a small fortune in
cash and indorsed checks

    a lot of this training should be a part of the public-school system chicago
has started it and the courses it offers to office boys reveal the movement as an
advanced type of commercial college

one of germanys greatest steals

when the kaisers u-boat c- was on exhibition in central park new
york among the throngs that came to see it was william hammatg
davis a patent lawyer who has devoted years of study to submarine
patents and mechanism pie discovered that germany had been steal-
ing yankee brains and ingenuity and turning them against us the c- almost
duplicated the holland type of submarine the patents of which were filed in
germany some fourteen years ago

    mr davis report of the stealings are summarized as follows

    steal no -design of boat almost duplicates that of the holland type of
submarine built for the united states navy by the electric boat company even
down to the characteristic spindle shape and nonwater-tight superstructure

    steal no -the degree of submergence controlled by horizontal rudders
located at bow and stern these bow rudders are identical with the holland
type as to location size function et cetera	

    steal no j-provisions for regulating buoyancy of boat in the center
is a ballast tank of considerable size to which water can be admitted through a
kingston valve in the bottom of the hull with this tank filled buoyancy of
boat is greatly reduced allowing it to float in the so-called awash condition
tank must be completely filled to function properly and the most involved
mathematical calculations are necessary to work this point out and was one of
the fundamental laws laid down by lohn p holland

    steal ato -the lighter-than-water principle has been snatched brazenly
in all its ramifications this holland principle is as important to submarines as
the heavier-than-air principle is to the air plane and is the basis of good
handling qualities of the holland type of boat

    steal no -a ballast tank is located on top of the main ballast tank in
caught in the net

iii

vertical alignment with the ccnter of gravity and center of buoyancy-another
of the holland fundamental features to which the success of his submarine is
largely attributed for by keeping the main tank filled and using auxiliary tank
for buoyancy adjustment the boat can stand practically still with only the peri-
scope out of the water and lie in wait for its prey

canadas patriotism

the canadian general elections held recently resulted in a sweeping vic-
tory for a union government composed of conservatives and liberals
headed by sir robert borden leader of the previous conservative admin-
istration in many respects it was the most noteworthy election ever held

in canada the main issue was compulsory military service on a basis of selec-
tive draft versus a continuation of the system of voluntary enlistment the
former policy swept the country

    three years of war saw canada still retaining the obsolete unfair and
inadequate system of voluntary enlistment under which however she had raised
some  troops mainly in the english-speaking provinces but this had
exhausted the volunteering material recruiting was dead heavy casualty
lists made immediate reenforcements necessary and the only way to obtain
them was by compulsion

    accordingly sir robert borden then leading a conservative government
brought down a compulsory-service measure and at the same time proposed to
sir wilfrid laurier then leading the liberal opposition a coalition government
of both parties on a fifty-fifty basis of cabinet representation

    sir wilfrid refused this proposal and opposed compulsory service in which
he was backed solidly by his own province quebec

    as a result while laurier carried sixty-two out of sixty-five quebec seats
and broke approximately even in the maritime provinces where there is a large
french-speaking population his candidates were elected in ten only of ontarios
eighty-two seats and in but two of the fifty-four seats of manitoba saskatche-
wan alberta and british columbia

    in a parliament of two hundred and thirty-five members the vote in canada
gave borden a majority of nearly fifty the result amounts to a line-up of
english-speaking canada on one side and french-speaking canada on the other

    the new government takes office with a direct mandate from the people
to fight the war to a finish with men money and materials
the business of looking ahead

                  by james hay jr

author of are you the anarchist of your owi future etc

              not fiction but a few pages of striking facts gathered
              from the experience of some eminent americans

leslie m shaw former secre-
tary of the treasury once told
me

        i was twelve years old when i
decided what i would do with my life
i remember it as distinctly as if it had
happened yesterday i was a bare-
footed kid with a big rip in the right
knee of my short breeches and i was
in my fathers garden pulling weeds
the mud oozing up between my toes
when i wiggled them all of a sudden
disgusted with weeds mud and the
whole business of farming i made up
my mind that i would be a banker
that appealed to me as the greatest
destiny i could shape for myself

  at the age of thirty-two he was a
banker

  henry f ashurst united states sen-
ator from arizona related this

  i always wanted to be a member
of the senate when i was ten years
old in a rather primitive school at
flagstaff i wrote my name in one of
my books and put after the name
united states senator from arizna
i never lost sight of that ambition i
worked for its fulfillment until at last
i achieved it

  he was thirty-seven years old when
he entered the senate the journey
from the flagstaff schoolhouse to the
united states capitol had involved his
being a cowboy a deputy sheriff a hod-
carrier a lumberjack a newspaper re-
porter a law student a member and
the speaker of the arizona legislature
a member of the territorial council a
district attorney and a lawyer in pri-
vate practice

  andrew carnegie on one occasion
made this statement to a friend

  my success in life wras not due to
the fact that i started out with the
clear-cut object of doing a certain thing
or reaching any certain position no
special and shining eminence attracted
me from the beginning my aim and
my ambition was to do one job so well
that i would be bound to get the one
next higher up-to do that and to look
around for any practical means of bet-
tering myself financially i progressed
step by step never knowing where i
should eventually laid

  that was his system for getting to
the top after starting out as a weavers
assistant in a cotton factory then as
a telegraph messenger boy and after
that as a railroad telegrapher

  a genius in the advertising world
arrived in washington not long ago
having encountered him on the street
i asked him where he was going fie
informed me he was on his way to the
white house among other things he
said

  when i left washington seventeen
years ago the best i had been able to
do was to draw a weekly salary of four-
teen dollars in the business office of a
newspaper i determined that i would
never set my foot in this town again
unless i had amounted to enough to
be invited to the white house by the
president i figured that a man might
calf himself successful if he could rise
to that importance

  he was on his way to the executive
mansion because the president wanted
to make uc of him in a national way
the business of looking aheiv

as a result of his influential connection
with a group of powerful new york
and chicago capitalists in order to
have this invitation issued to him he
had worked in the united states and
three countries of europe had written
several books had made a reputation
as a reorganizer of corporations had
mastered the intricacies of railroad
management had become an authority
on certain manufacturing methods and
had taken his place at the top of the
advertising world

  i have mentioned these four men-
shaw ashurst carnegie and the
white house guest-as striking exam-
ples of the fact that there is one at-
tribute characteristic of all successful
men  matter how widely different
their ambitions their methods or their
achievements may be every success-
ful man has it without it  man
ever succeeds

  christopher columbus had it wtood-
row wilson has it it is the explana-
tion of why iienry ford at the age
of fifty-four is still the marvel of the
automobile-manufacturing world it is
the ladder on which edward n hurley
climbed from his position as a railway-
locomotive engineer to a kingship in the
pneumatic-tool business and later to his
present job of building the ships this
government needs for war purposes

  this attribute is what i call the
soul of success

  many thousands of men are inquir-
ing desperately to-day why they do not
succeed why they do not get up higher
in the world and they make the in-
quiry desperately because they have
never been taught and have never
learned that without this soul of
success thy cannot get to the top

  they are the human italics of the
fact that for countless generations men
have been getting the wrong tips mis-
leading steers as to what will bring
them success by success in this con-
nection  mean achievements which put
them noticeably above the general run
and ruck of men such achievements
as the accumulation of money power
fame or influence over their fellows

  from early childhood clear up to
  b r

maturity they have had instilled into
them the essence of nonsense they
have been taught and they have be-
lieved this highly comforting proposi-
tion 

  if you are honest industrious re-
liable moral punctual law-abiding in-
telligent and dutiful you are bound to
succeed

  that is the height of absurdity as
a recipe for success it is not worth the
paper its written on do you believe
that honesty industry morality punc-
tuality and the other virtues enumer-
ated in the copybooks lead to success
i you do take your stand on any
crowded street corner of any city from
seven-thirty to eight-thirty any week-
day morning

  what you see there is a hurrying
bustling parade of thousands of able-
bodied men and women--and the vast
majority of them if you investigate
them you will find to be possessed of
the strictest integrity praiseworthy in-
dustry astounding punctuality irre-
proachable morals and a very lively
sense of duty and yet ninety-nine out
of a hundred of them are not now and
never will be superior to their fellows
in usefulness power or wealth

  the men who become discouraged as
to their future the ones who want to
know how they can beat the game
have discovered that all the virtues un-
der heaven do not necessarily lead to
success they have waked up to the
fact that they have been victimized by
the old teachings the ancient dope as
to how to beat the game of life

  and they are right they have been
victimized they have been given the
shadow and not the substance to say
that a man will be a success simply
because he does his duty and lives vir-
tuously is exactly as logical as to say
that a mummy because it has hands
and feet and a head can burst its band-
ages and run a cross-country race

  wthat a man needs in addition to
right living and the virtues in order
to reach high achievement is what
shaw ashurst carnegie and the ad-
vertising genius possessed-the soul
of success the thing which if a man


the popular magazine

is not already possessed of it he is able
to acquire

  this soul of success may be defined
thus

  courageous seeing ahead

  that is the best definition which all
the successful men with whom i have
talked have been able to give me it
means the handling of your job to-day
so that you are training yourself to
do a bigger job to-morrow

  it sounds as simple as pie in a way
it is simple successful men will tell
you almost invariably that their success
seems to them in the retrospect quite
a natural evolution it all came as
the result of work hard work is the
explanation you get from practically all
of them

  many men have courage theyre
full of it they will butt their heads
against anything in front of them but
it is of no avail unless it is made effec-
tive by the ability to see ahead to
know where the butting will lead and
what it will produce on the other
hand many have the vision they can
see ahead they can tell how they would
prosper and rise if they did this or
that but the planning is of no value
unless it is backed up by the courage
to step out and carry through the
promptings of the vision

  this soul of success is the high
spirit the vital plunge the incessant
urge that makes a man run always on
the track leading to big achievement
he works to-day because he knows
everything he does must carry him to
something better and if he works in
that spirit he ultimately gets what he
is looking for

  i once commented on this to an emi-
nent american psychologist he gave
this explanation

  it is very natural a thing grounded
in a proper appreciation of human
feelings birds of a feather flock to-
gether the man whohas already suc-
ceeded the employer can spot every
time the man who is going to succeed
it makes no difference whether the
worker is a puddler in a steel mill or
a draftsman in an architects office or

a salesman in a department store-the
man above him being possessed of the
same characteristic the determination
to succeed recognizes it and rewards
it

  that explains how charles m
schwab knew at a glance that lie
wanted eugene grace then a lowly sub-
ordinate to succeed him as the head
of bethlehem steel

  it is why woodrow wilson almost
invariably asks a retiring government
official to tip him off as to what man
in that particular office is fitted to fill
the higher job

  it shows why if you happen to be
the head of any establishment or branch
of an establishment you know at once
to whom in the office you will turn over
your desk while you take a vacation or
while you are called out of town

  the possessors of this soul of suc-
cess identify each other unfailingly
and the possession of it is a sure guar-
antee of promotion

  any man who is without it can ac-
quire it the young salesman cover-
ing a certain territory decides to take
on another line of stuff from that
moment he has the courageous seeing-
ahead quality the bum who braces
up quits the booze game and pitches
in to make his own way finds himself
suddenly possessed of it

  the regulations the copy-book texts
create the false impression that the
mere observance of them will bring
great success it is not true their
observance will keep you out of jail
and in good health and prossibly bring
in enough money to keep the wolf from
the door

  but if you want to succeed if you
want to excel make one new rule for
yourself an eleventh commandment of
work and business

  to-day take a look into to-morrow
and make to-day bend the shape of
to-morrow somewhat to your own pur-
poses

  thats what shaw carnegie and the
advertising genius did it is what you
can do it is what you must do if you
want to succeed

marked military bearing who walked
stolidly up and down before the fidget-
ing colored man

  the stolid passenger carried a heavy
grip which he had refused to relinquish
to the porter instead he had pre-
sented that obsequious menial with half
a dollar accompanying the gratuity
with a request in german-american
speech i will say when i get on
not so he had given this implied
command five minutes before in the
meantime he had trudged up and down
with marked precision puffing at a long
thick cigar as he marched his atten-
tion was directed with constant though
furtive vigila-nce in the direction of
the entrance gate 

  only a quatah of a minute loss

dis train leaves right on time sah
the impatient porter warned the ger-
man

  as the darky spoke an athletic blond
giant rushed through the gates and ran
headlong toward the last pullman the
german witnessing the hurried dash
of the belated passenger calmly threw
away the remaining stub of his cigar
handed his grip to the nervous porter
and with evident relief climbed aboard
instead of entering the second car he
crossed the vestibule to the last sleeper
rapidly passing through to the smoking
compartment in the rear

  from behind the curtain of the smok-
ing room he heard the entrance of the
tardy arrival who laughed and joked
with the conductor over his narrow
escape from being left behind as the
newcomer yielded his baggage to a
grinning porter the german cautiously
stepped intohe narrow aisle and noted
with satisfaction that the seat in which
the luggage was deposited adjoined his
own he verified this by a covert ex-
amination of the small red slip he held
in his hand

satisfied with his observations and
with himself as well apparently the
watcher slipped back to the smoking
room and resigned himself to the alter-
nate contemplation of a fresh cigar and
his own image in the glass opposite
he smirked at his own reflection twirl-
the popular magazine

ing his upstanding grayish mustache
patting his thinning gray hair and with
evident self-esteem carefully arranging
a few straggling wisps that marred the
even symmetry preserved by the wide
shining part directly in the middle of
his round sleek head in spite of his
clean and careful appearance however
it is doubtful that a casual observer
would have been so favorably impressed
as was the gentleman himself the
end of his nose was almost flat caus-
ing one to wonder if it had grown so
or whether it had been sliced off with
a razor or perhaps with a more sinister
weapon his skin also was far from
smooth and regular being marked with
pits and dents the result of acute acne
years before altogether his smiling
reflection would need more than its sur-
face charms to induce a feeling of con-
fidence on the critical observer

 assuring himself of the likelihood
of continued freedom from interrup-
tion he withdrew from the inner pocket
of his waistcoat a long official-looking
envelope it was postmarked washing-
ton district of columbia dated four
days before and addressed to major a
dermstott care of german consulate
 s michigan avenue chicago illi-
nois

  the first inclosure was a short note
on the official paper of the german em-
bassy and contained the following in-
structions 

  operative no  has succeeded in the
discovery of sufficiently valuable data to
warrant your immediate presence in colo-
rado an explosive of extraordinary pos-
sibilities is being employed by one douglas
campbell in connection with certain mining
operations on his property near trinidad

  no  has been in the employ of said
campbell for a period of forty-eight days
a copy of his report is inclosed it is ap-
parent that further progress in securing pos-
session of the necessary information so de-
sirable to the imperial government is be-
yond the capabilities of no 

  the latter advises that said campbell is
about to leave for the east go to denver
at once and await advices from no 
as to the exact date of campbells departure
accompany him without fail and with no
regard for expense secure the secret of this
explosive you are relied upon to allow
nothing to interfere with the success of this
mission

 the german carefully folded this
communication and opened a second
from the same envelope it was shorter
than the first and contained the follow-
ing information

a dermstott esq denver colorado

  mr douglas campbell leaves denver for
chicago on the sixth via the denver spe-
cial or by the following train which leaves
around noon of the same day

  a snapshot of mr campbell is incloscd
to insure unmistakable identification

  he has shipped a pound of r to new
york city by wells fargo he expects to
dispose of it there	no 

 a persual of this message was fol-
lowed by a close scrutiny of the snap-
shot accompanying it which showed a
tall handsome well-built man dressed
in the rough careless garb of a miner
except for the change in dress to
new and somewhat expensive store
clothes the likeness between the tardy
arrival of the morning and the man in
the picture was perfect

 it is not to doubt major derm-
stott muttered to himself perfectly
satisfied on this score he carefully
placed the message from no  beside
the first as well as the snapshot he
next devoted his attention to the copy
of the report from no  mentioned
in the first communication its interest
was sufficiently absorbing to warrant
the close study devoted to it by the
methodical teuton as the following re-
production may disclose

report of mo  copy

  in respect of explosive employed near
trinidad colorado by one douglas camp-
bell

  following instructions arrived in trini-
dad two months ago two weeks later se-
cured employment at the dorothy  mine
operated by douglas campbell for over a
year all operations carried  by owner with
help of but one man

  the mine is a mountain some four thou-
sand eight hundred feet high title con-
tested three years ago by consolidated ex-
ploration company carried on appeal by
them to supreme court of colorado but de-
cided against them in favor of campbell

  mine worked for silver up to april 
nothing but surface blasting carried on since
following peculiar explosion resulting in the
death of one of campbells miners entire
mountain shows traces of silver gold lead
copper and zinc all in more or less unim-
the campbells are coming



portant quantities also numerous traces of
other metals common throughout the state
unusual outcropping of uraninite over entire
property nothing exactly similar within a
radius of thirty miles

  since my employment have witnessed two
most stupendous explosions more than sub-
stantiating advices relative to their charac-
ter responsible for my presence here

  on each occasion the blasts had been pre-
pared by mr campbell himself without my
knowledge they were shot by electricity
from a distance of about a mile mr camp-
bell notifying me of the blasts which we
witnessed together from a perfectly safe dis-
tance

  the power of these explosions was ter-
rific a first rather faint report was fol-
lowed by a detonation terrifying in its in-
tensity it was followed by a concussion
that would have thrown us both to the
ground but for the precaution insisted on
iiv mr campbell that we lie flat as he made
the electrical connection a blast of hot
scorching wind rolled down the mountain
ahead of the flying mass of dust steam and
smoke due to the blast and even at a miles
distance proved sufiocating and most uncom-
fortable

  two days after each blast the beat around
the center of explosion abated sufficiently to
allow an examination of the ground as
we approached the devastation was awful
and complete within a radius of two thou-
sand feet dead birds and dead game lay
thick at every few steps livery vestige of
vegetable life had been reduced to ashes and
cinders

   lie center of these explosions resembled
the crater of a volcano there were traces
of every metal previously mentioned but all
in conglomerate fusion there were abso-
lutely no traces of uranium though in each
case i remembered generous outcroppings of
uraninite thereabouts

  the most astonishing result however was
the presence of radium in its pure metal
state it was to secure it that mr camp-
bell had caused these terrific explosions as
he set me to gathering every atom of it
from one explosion we recovered eight
grams from the other a little better than
nine and a half grams

  it is worthy of mention here that this
radium was not placed in lead receptacles
instead mr campbell employed boxes of
some alloy lie had perfected himself it ap-
pears to have all the properties of steel ex-
eeptthat of hardness also it will not tar-
nish nor rust is very ductile is absolutely
nonradio active and possesses remarkable
heat-resisting properties

  regarding this alloy he seems very will-
ing to talk although he will not say a word
in explanation of the explosions it appears
that he lias perfected a receptacle of this
alloy in which he places a small quantity of
radium and by some ingenious mechanism

injects another element i have been abso-
lutely unable to discover the result is a
rise in temperature that he claims will heat
the water of a boiler containing three thou-
sand gallons to  and maintain it with
no decrease in the power of the radium em-
ployed

  as near as i can estimate the cost of the
radium to mr campbell cannot exceed five
dollars a gram it is therefore self-evident
that he has discovered a means of cheap
power that will revolutionize industry if he
has his device perfected as he claims to have
it it is regarding this result that his sole
interest concerns itself with the radium
he must have he is many times a million-
aire as tiiere are evidences of at least two
hundred explosions

  after each explosion air campbell car-
ried the radium to trinidad and on eacli oc-
casion i attempted to reproduce the same
effect during his absence we have plenty
of dynamite and i am sure he employs it to
secure his result my use of it in locations
similar jo those he had chosen however has
been fruitless there is some secret of his
method i cannot discover

  mr campbell goes east with a quantity of-
radium soon i am to remain while he is
away i am convinced this will prove a
waste of time i have done everything i
could and investigated every inch of the
property and buildings there is absolutely
no clew to show bis method of securing such
formidable explosions

  i await further instructions no 

  it was possibly the third or fourth
time that mr dermstott had carefully
perused this somewhat remarkable re-
port with each perusal his imagina-
tion had presented new and startling
possibilities

  marvelous he murmured to him-
self what a weapon for warfare

  carefully replacing the papers and
pinning them into further security he
lighted a fresh cigar and gave himself
to satisfied contemplation of the success
he expected to achieve

  roused from his absorption by the
first call for lunch he arose peered
into the car aisle through the smoking-
room curtains leisurely performed a
careful toilet and betook himself to
the dining car ahead as he entered
the diner he noted that the belated pas-
senger whose arrival he had witnessed
with such interest was already seated
the german waved aside the proffered
direction of an important head waiter
and seated himself opposite the tall
blond giant


the popular magazine

  i hope you will not object he said
with a short curt bow i greatly dis-
like that servants should presume to
direct my movements i always do ex-
actly contrary to their wishes it is
the only satisfaction i can get out of
them in your country

  theyve got us trained a lot better
than that the young man replied with
a smile that showed genuine amuse-
ment

  as he smiled the big broad-shoul-
dered blond was very pleasant to look
upon he was browned with exposure
naturally suggesting an out-of-door
employment his high intellectual
forehead and thoughtful brown eyes
insured studious leanings however and
probable scholarly training as his face
settled into repose lines of authority
and responsbility disclosed themselves
because of them it was hard to guess
his age he might be forty or even
ten years younger as a matter of fact
he was exactly thirty-two

  youre not an american then the
younger man continued

  no i am german though i have
done a great deal of business in amer-
ica allow me to introduce myself
my name ii dermstott my card sir

  the young man politely accepted the
card and read

major adolph dermstott
hotel touraine

                  washington d c

  pleased to meet you major im
sorry i havent a card im an engineer
and my name is douglas campbell
headquarters-colorado as the
young man gave these particulars he
smiled and shook hands with the ger-
man

  you are a mining engineer is it not
so inquired the major i have just
come from a visit to a number of yrour
colorado copper mines i have sought
to buy quantities of copper but it has
been what you call a difficult job so
little of copper and at such terrible
prices

  thats a little out of my line re-
plied the american but i can imagine
you have had your troubles this war

of yours has made copper prices hum
out here before the war you could
have bought a hundred copper holes
for a side of bacon

  i could wish i had made some of
those side meat bargains then but
here is our food it costs almost as
much as copper so let us do full jus-
tice to it

  as they ate the german entertained
his new acquaintance with a flow of
talk that stamped him as a conversa-
tionalist of no mean order to the
american the experience was a most
grateful one for his four years of min-
ing life had presented little opportuni-
ties for companionship with men of ed-
ucation so well informed or so affable
as major dermstott

  their meal finished the new friends
returned to their own smoking apart-
ment where campbell was presented
with a cigar by the german its ex-
quisite aroma and soothing effects ac-
centuated a feeling of well-being begun
by the excellent meal

  i believe you said you were in the
mining business mr campbell sug-
gested the major if not interested in
copper i suppose you have been getting
rich with gold or silver perhaps 

  no not exactly the american re-
plied stretching his long legs comfort-
ably i have done some silver mining
but it had been rather unprofitable some
time before the war started and i got
out of it just a little too soon how-
ever i have no cause for regret on that
score as by great good luck i stumbled
onto a discovery that has put me on
easy street for the rest of my life for
almost three years i have been mining
radium

  ah  exclaimed the german so 
but i thought yrour colorado uranite
had been proved to yield a very low
percentage of radium only fifteen or
twenty grams to the ton and even less
in most cases

  i believe that the tests of the gov-
ernment have proved that the ordinary
method of extraction bear little promise
of a practical nature however a dis-
covery i happened to make bears no
relation to the tedious and costly
the camcpcbells ape coming

method of securing a few grams of
radium bromide from a great mass of
uranium-bearing ore  have discov-
ered actual radium free and in a metal
state since the war radium has in-
creased in price from thirty-five thou-
sand dollars to fifty thousand dollars
a gram during the past three years
i have recovered a little over twenty
pounds troy weight of fmre radium
mein gott exclaimed the german
but such a quantity of radium would
make of you a regular croesus

  it ought to replied campbell
calmly but you must remember it
is hardly like possessing that much in
government bonds for instance the
market for radium is not what might
be described as extremely active as
a matter of fact i am now on my way
to new york city where i hope to
dispose of a pound of radium i an-
ticipate a good bit of running around
and probably the consumption of not a
little time but as i am prepared to sell
it for about twenty per cent of its ac-
tual market value it is possible that i
may have better success than otherwise
might obtain

  ah so commented the major with
immediate interest do you mean to
say that you will dispose of your radium
for ten thousand dollars a gram 
well replied campbell not ex-
actly as you have expressed it i do
not propose to peddle it around at ten
thousand dollars a gram however
if i am sufficiently fortunate to discover
some one man or some group of men
willing to take it all i will sell it-at a
reduction

  the major became soberly concerned
and extracting a gold-mounted pencil
from his pocket figured rapidly on the
back of an envelope completing his
computation he thought for a moment
and then said

  i think i shall present myself as a
prospective purchaser of a pound if
you want to let it go for a couple of
millions

  you will be as welcome as the flow-
ers in may major replied campbell
thinking his companion was attempting
a bit of german humor at his expense

 i havent a pound on my person but
 if you have the two million about you
 ill give you a bill of sale

   no no protested the german
 seriously it will take some few days
 to raise so much of money but i think
 it can be done i am all in earnest
 do you accept my offer 

   why certainly major dermstott
 nothing could please me better as i
 fully expected to spend a month secur-
 ing a buyer the radium will arrive
 in new york by wells fargo express
 several days before i get there  i am
 going to detroit for three days after
 we arrive in chicago and by that time
 you may tell me whether or not you
 have changed your mind

   i do not change my mind replied
 dermstott sternly i will buy your
 radium if it proves to be as you claim
 when do you leave from detroit
 this is the sixth meditated camp-
 bell i shall visit my fiancee three
 days that will be the eighth ninth
 and tenth yes i shall leave for new
 york on the fast train which leaves
 detroit at six oclock on the evening
 of the tenth that will land me in
 new york early in the morning of the
 eleventh

   that is settled then replied the
 major where shall i find you in new
york 

 i shall stop at the hotel furnald
 very good the german made a
 note of the time and place in his pocket-
 book and where shall you go from
 new york

   i expect to go to washington an-
 swered campbell i hope to interest
 the government in a little patent that
 has engaged a good deal of my time
 and thought during the past year
 so the major nodded cordially
 i must arrange to go on with you to
 washington i have many friends there
 and some influence in official circles
 it may be an assistance to you i shall
 be glad to afford

   that will be extremely kind of you
 i know no one in washington and any
 help in getting on to the ropes wrill cer-
 tainly be appreciated

   it is a bargain sir the german


the poular magazine

said rising and shaking hands with
the american and now if you do
not mind i shall take a little siesta
dermstott left his companion in the
smoking room and before settling him-
self for the nap he had expressed a
desire to secure retired to the observa-
tion car and at one of the small tables
wrote a long telegram which he later
translated into a code from a book he
guarded carefully from any passing eye
the completed message he handed to
the conductor with a five-dollar bill
and a stern admonition that it be dis-
patched at the very first stop

  before the call for dinner he managed
to secure an hours repose to all ap-
pearances being dead to the world as
he lay stretched across his parlor-car
seat he was aroused by his companion
of the afternoon who smilingly sug-
gested that they eat dinner together

  during the process of this important
function the major did most of the talk-
ing and regaled his companion with
many stories of strange peoples and
strange places

  for the remainder of the trip the
two were together constantly but only
when forced by politeness did the major
make any reference to their first con-
versation or its result

  it was only as they drew into the
northwestern station in chicago at two
the following day that major dermstott
made direct reference to their bargain

  i shall be busy here the rest of the
day so shall say good-by at the station
you do not leave before midnight be
very careful and do not let this wicked
city beguile you he laughed i
shall see you at the hotel furnald be-
fore eleven oclock on the morning of
the eleventh au revoir

  good-by major and good luck ill
be there never fear replied the amer-
ican as he left to secure a taxi for
across the river

  the rest of the day passed quickly
for the westerner who found the
sights of a big city a pleasing novelty
however he was beckoned on by an
interest greater than any he found to
lure him in chicago and as he stepped
from the train in the detroit station

the next morning he wasted no time in
being driven to the home of his sweet-
heart on lawrence avenue

  despite the early hour he was given
a royal welcome a tempting breakfast
with dorothy simms being delayed by
many excited questions as well as by
the need for loverly communion so long
anticipated and so fervently enjoyed
by both

  the two had been lovers for five
years and the girl small and appealing
with deep blue eyes and a mass of curly
brown hair that crowned her well-
shaped head reflected a thoughtful
tenderness

  it has seemed such a long long
time she whispered as she nestled in
his broad-shouldered embrace it
seems almost too good to be true that
we shant have to wait much longer

  in a month more sweetheart well
hunt up a sky pilot were rich dor-
othy beastly vulgarly rich

  dont joke about it dear its too
serious

  im not joking a bit dear heart
its true fie then told her of his
meeting with the german assuring her
that even if this means failed he had
every prospect of securing twenty times
as much if he wanted or needed it

  my gasped the girl its too big
to comprehend come and eat before
everything gets cold maybe in time i
can school myself into realizing that
my big blond sweetheart is a million-
aire but if you tell me you can at last
get awayr from that dirty old mine and
live where people dont eat with their
knives ill be satisfied with five thou-
sand dollars a year

  the hours passed swiftly and hap-
pily and on the morning of the third
day the westerner suggested to his
sweetheart that a visit to her uncle
josiah simms was a duty and a pleas-
ure he could not leave without per-
forming he made an appointment
with the latter over the telephone and
just after lunch walked around the
block and entered the attractive house
on burlingame avenue where the old
retired lawyer welcomed him effusively

  well well glad to see you my boy
the campbells are coming



taint the fashion for the young bloods
to waste much time on us old ones any
more didnt think youd remember
old simms but you did eh regular
john d now dot tells me sit down
sit down

  the old man bustled about fussily
wiping his old-fashioned steel-rimmed
spectacles with his huge silk handker-
chief flicking imaginary dust from the
furniture with the tails of his long
loose alpaca coat and peering curiously
at the smiling young man josiah
simms was a character in the neigh-
borhood having as he repeatedly
warned everybody retired from a lucra-
tive criminal-law practice at sixty that
he might fittingly enjoy the remainder
of his youth douglas campbell en-
joyed the old man thoroughly and en-
tertained a respect for his judgment
that he never failed to show an atti-
tude that secretly pleased mr simms
immensely

  you knew i couldnt leave without
saying howdy mr simms and besides
i want to consult you semiprofession-
ally

 humph grunted the old man
thought so murder will out well
lets know the worst at once wine
women or song

  neither laughed the young man
i want you to draw a will for me
lord love us youd think the man
was seventy-five and expected to kick
the bucket any minute  what in time
do you want a will for 

  ill tell you mr simms replied
campbell soberly through no fault
of brains or work i am suddenly worth
a good many million dollars and it
seems criminal to risk safeguarding
those i love i have in my possession
actual radium worth-well i wont try
to tell you what its worth you
wouldnt believe me but i have the
radium and i know where theres a
hundred times more that belongs to me
by every good right and title

  whats this  whats this  colo-
rado arabian nights or just having
fun with an ignorant old man 

	i wras never more in earnest in my
life mr simms i have discovered a

method of securing actual radium in
its free state after a terrific explo-
sion that killed one of my men i dis-
covered radium on the spot of the
explosion i also found close to it an-
other metal in a free state this would
not have been remarkable except for
the fact that some fourteen or fifteen
other metals were present but all in a
state of conglomerate fusion i tried
for months to reproduce the conditions
and the entire story of my experiments
is contained in this envelope which i
wish you to retain in the event of
my death all you need to do is follow
the directions i have carefully outlined
when millions of dollars worth of ra-
dium may be secured for my heirs who
are to be dorothy and my mother share
and share alike

  you are certainly loading me down
with a pretty heavy responsibility my
son replied mr simms soberly i
am not so sure that i care to under-
take it at my age

  you must mr simms earnestly
insisted campbell you really must
for the most important thing i have
yet to tell you and i dont know of a
soul i dare trust it to but you

  well mr simms reluctantly an-
swered ill listen wont promise but
im still young enough to be curious
i have solved the power problem
of the world mr simms and if any-
thing happens to me you must see that
it is preserved for the good of all the
people i have here a little device made
of an alloy i have discovered within
it is less than a grain of radium it
also contains a very small quantity of
the other metal i referred to by plac-
ing this little box in any boiler up to
three thousand gallons capacity i can
maintain a temperature of two hundred
and twelve and continue to generate
steam at absolutely no cost whatever
after installation i reckon if the
boiler will last for a thousand years
it will continue to generate steam at no
cost for that length of time

  good lord ejaculated the inter-
ested mr simms but what raises
the temperature the box is not hot
now


the popular magazine

  that is one of the secrets but ill
tell it to you it is raised to the high
degree of heat by the simple injection
of pure water it was only by discov-
ering this effect of the water that i was
able to duplicate the original explosion
i have perfected this little device so
that by setting an indicator the amount
qf water to be added is attended to
automatically

  it will absolutely revolutionize in-
dustrial conditions excitedly ex-
claimed the little old man but can
you explain just what the water does
no i cant theres a lot about
radium that men who have studied it
for years dont even try to guess water
on radium alone has no effect at all
in fact it is through hidden streams
that most of the radium is supposed
to have been carried down to its pres-
ent state i cant explain the failure of
the other metal to fuse cither but the
fact remains that i find them unfused
and side by side after every dynamite
shot following an explosion that is
simply terrific all i had to do after
reasoning out the presence of water in
the original explosion was to pipe water
to the spot i wanted to test arrange
my shot and fire it by electricity from
a point about a mile away

  very curious very mumbled the
old man well ill draw you a will
call ellen in and we two will witness
it wont take five minutes

  mr simms pecked away at his type-
writer for two or three minutes and
presented a document about an inch
long

  sign here he pointed short
and sweet but the lord chief justice
himself couldnt break it ellen-i say
ellen-come in here and write your
name

 the servant entered campbell
signed and the two witnessed his tes-
tament

  my boy mr simms said in a most
solemn manner i shall certainly accept
the responsibility of guarding this
secret it is the greatest thing since
the introduction of machinery i con-
fidently expect to have light heat and

power at an honest rate before i grow
eld

  you will live to see it before an-
other year rolls around unless i die
if i do die ill expect you to accom-
plish it for me i wanted you to know
as this discovery goes to dorothy and
mother with the rest

  i understand just run along now
and let me think about this as i take
my nap quit work for that reason
always wanted a nap in the afternoon
and never got one till i quit good
luck and look me up when you get
back

  good-by mr simms ill see you
the first thing on my return

  during the few hours that remained
before his departure the young man
spent in discussing the immediate fu-
ture with his fiancee and before he
knew it his taxi was waiting to whirl
him to the station the sadness of the
usual lovers parting was entirely ab-
sent however for to both the separa-
tion to be endured was fraught with
every promise of an early and lasting
happiness

  good-by boy dorothy smiled
come back soon if you dont get
the millions ill be watching just the
same good luck and write me every
day

  ill come back if i have to get here
on a stretcher and ill have the mil-
lions  be sure of that select the brides-
maids sweetheart and when you get
my wire the campbells are coming
call up the minister good-b ill be
thinking of you every minute

  good-by dear the campbells are
coming will be my daily expectation
and write me every day

  within twenty-five minutes from his
last sight of a waving handkerchief he
was deposited at the michigan central
station where he found an unusual
number awaiting a chance to purchase
their tickets for the detroiter as he
was preparing to crowd in for his own
reservation he felt a timid touch on
the arm and turning saw a remarka-
bly handsome woman quietly but ele-
gantly dressed evidently disturbed by
the campbells are coming



the crowded impatient line between
herself and the ticket window

  i beg your pardon but i am sure
you will not resent my request she
said with an appealing voice that com-
manded his immediate solicitude i
wish you would secure for me a ticket
and berth to new york i have been
standing here for over five minutes
and have been crowded out of the line
until i am afraid i shall miss the train
i shall be very glad to serve you
madam he replied with interest do
not worry at all we have plenty of
time and i can assure you a berth if
one is to be had

  thank you so much she replied
quietly with every appearance of re-
lief and stepping to one side

  within a few moments mr camp-
bell quietly secured two tickets and
berth reservations and rejoined the
lady

  here is your ticket madam also
a lower berth it was the last one
and i fear the man has given me an
upper directly above you

  i appreciate your kindness exceed-
ingly murmured the woman you
may be sure that since they are selling
upper berths there was every chance
of my having a much less agreeable
occupant above me than yourself
they are calling the train he re-
plied with a smile at her compliment
we may as well go through i think
the westerner saw his chance com-
panion to her seat and with a bow ex-
cused himself and retired to the library
car in the rear where he remained en-
grossed in his newspapers until the call
for dinner the head waiter met him
at the door and ushered him to a seat
with a woman to the back of whose
stylishly marcelled brown head he gave
only a casual look in passing as he
seated himself however he was agree-
ably pleased to find himself opposite
the lady he had aided in the station
who smiled warmly and with polished
self-possession started a conversation
as with a friend of long standing

  throughout the meal mr campbell
was interested in his companion to a
marked degree and by the time they

returned to their pullman he had
learned that she too was on the way
to washington but expected to stop in
new york for a day or two where her
husband was to join her she also told
him she would be stopping at the fur-
nald where she trusted she might have
the pleasure of introducing him to her
husband

  after a few moments in further con-
versation he left her for his after-din-
ner cigar during the consumption of
which he engaged in chance conversa-
tion with three or four well-dressed
prosperous-looking fellow passengers

  soon running out of fertile topics
of conversation one of the party pro-
posed a little game and as the limit
suggested was only ten cents all four
were soon settled in a corner of the
car as rapt in their game as though
the limit had been table stakes

  it was with a distinct shock of sur-
prise that mr campbell discovered that
it was two oclock before he had any
idea the game had extended past mid-
night when with an apology for the
necessity of a good nights rest he left
the party and started for bed as he
paused opposite the section containing
his berth he was considerably surprised
to note that the upper had not been
lowered and calling the porter he be-
rated that servitor roundly

  i sure is sorry boss but i suttenly
undastood de lady to say dat whole sec-
tion was hers suh i suttenly did
you aint need to worry do ill have
dat berth down and made up in de
shake ob a lambs tail right away
boss right away

  never mind and dont talk so loud
youll have the whole car up in a min-
ute no need to disturb the lady at
any rate ill just take another upper
upper twelve is all ready boss and
thank you suh i sure is sorry

  all right all right shut up and
get your ladder

  as he climbed into his new berth
it occurred to campbell to wonder at
such a strange mistake but being
drowsy he wasted little time in falling
asleep to awake next morning almost
an hour past his usual time for arising


the popular magazine

as lie emerged from the wash room he
met -the usurper of his rightful berth
as she was returning from the iadies
dressing- room and was greeted by a
cheery good morning as both were
on the point of going to breakfast they
went together finding more than suffi-
cient material for interested conversa-
tion in the mistake of the porter which
both agreed was highly typical of the
intelligence to be expected from an
ethiopian mind

  they finished breakfast barely in
time to allow a hasty donning of wraps
and gathering of belongings as they slid
into the end of the tunnel of the grand
central station and together they left
the train and secured a taxi for the
ride to their hotel at the door the
lady thanked mr campbell cordially
allowing him to precede her which he
considered but natural under the cir-
cumstances he secured a small suite
on the twelfth floor received his mail
and immediately was shown to his
cjuarters

  he had left word at the desk that
major dermstott was to be shown up
at once on arrival but on reaching his
rooms he discovered in his mail a note
from that gentleman which read

  dkar mu campbell  have for every-
thing arranged but the sum of money is a
largo one and it will be impossible for me
to get it to you as early as i expected how-
ever by three oclock at the latest i shall
be in possession of the proper exchange

  please remain in your room until i call or
send a message it may be imperative that
 leave the city to-night so by concluding
our engagement as promptly as possible you
will do me a great favor

  you -will see or hear from me before three
oclock be waiting and ready yours with
respect	a dkkmstott

  guess anybody could wait with pa-
tience with five hours if he saw a mil-
lion or two at the end of it campbell
said to himself with a smile as he com-
posed himself comfortably in the big-
gest chair in the room after disposing
of his belongings to his complete satis-
faction

  after reading for over an hour he
wrote a long letter to dorothy this
pleasant daily task consumed the time
before lunch which he ordered served

in his room after a cigar he sat at
ease and thought and almost before he
knew it sank into a doze from which
he was aroused by the telephone an-
nouncing major dermstott who ap-
peared a few seconds later

  right up to the minute major he
was cordially greeted by campbell
glancing at his watch the time
surely flies in this town id have bet
a part of that bundle of cash it was
hardly one oclock

  you too are punctual my friend
the german politely answered it is
not the cash i have however but a
cashiers check on the hanover na-
tional bank

  just as good major campbell
laughed he pushed forward a chair
for the german and was preparing to
sink into another when a peremptory
knock on the door interrupted him
swinging open the door he was con-
fronted by a dapper little man correct
and proper to a fault as to everything
but his manner which was excited bel-
licose and as intimidating as hi stature
would permit immediately behind him
towered a coarse bullying individual
who would have been recognized for
what he was in almost any company

  the oddly assorted couple pushed
into the room and rudely slammed the
door

  which one is the scoundrelly hound
officer the little man fairly bellowed

  thats the guy replied his florid
companion pointing to campbell

  open that door burke again the
little man barked

  as he answered the first question the
flatfoot had edged toward the door
connecting mr campbells room with
the suite beyond and as his employers
second order was given the man quickly
opened the connecting door and flung
it back standing as though listening
to the uproar and considerably per-
plexed by it stood the woman of mr
campbells pullman experience she
was apparently dressed in her night
clothes over which a pink wrapper
show ed evidences of having been hast-
ily donned and her long beautiful hair
the camwells ae coming



hung loose and waving almost to her
waist

  every one in the room gasped or
stared with the exception of the now
thoroughly infuriated little intruder
the german was the first to break the
silence

  why this disturbance if you
please 

  shut that door burke weve
caught em with the goods on you
thought you could keep it up and get
away with it did you my beauty  he
yelled as the door was closing well
weve got the evidence now and for
more than just a divorce youll feel
smart defending a prosecution under
the mann act i guess not

  campbell was too dumfounded to
speak and the german again directed
a question

  will you be so kind as to explain
this melodrama my friend

  its beyond me major replied the
westerner

  beyond you is it well youre not
beyond me and ill take care to see you
aint if youre a friend of this home
breaker sputtered the little dandy di-
recting his remarks to the major you
may be interested in learning what kind
of scoundrel he is just give the evi-
dence burke

  been trailin this dame a week for
her husband mr deming here jumps
from new york to rochester and from
rochester to buffalo and from buffalo
to detroit leaves detroit last night at
six bells this guy goes with er buyin
the tickets and reservin a section wise
guy on the train only eatin with er
and playin cards in the smokin room
till after midnight no upper made up
breakfast together next mornin same
cab-same hotel--same door-connect-
in rooms unlocked and all free and
easy stay in together all day-lunch
all cozylike then us open door lady
about to peek in-neglijaylike nough
said

  yes but not enough done-yet
thundered the outraged deming come
on well get a warrant burke and
as suddenly as they had come they left

  so  grunted major dermstott it

would seem we have here a pretty ket-
tle of fish is there anything you would
care to tell me about it

  everything my dear major this
city life is too strenuous for me and
it looks like i need a little advice he
quickly outlined the circumstances of
his acquaintance with the lady

  so so commented the german
nodding his head ominously it is all
very clear tt is blackmail or a very
peculiar set of very convincing coinci-
dences this-what do you call it r-
game is quite common if it proves to
be blackmail but it is always a serious
thing for those who do not care to
have their reputations smutted the
people-they will laugh and shrug the

shoulders but- ah well we are

all too prone to think ill of somebody
else not so

  any way the cat jumps major its
bound to be hell im green to these
city ways but i dont need a telescope
to see trouble ahead in capital letters
what shall i do

  i think you may leave that to me
for the time being at least we must
first learn a little something about this
precious mr deming in the mean-
time you shall disappear come we
shall go at once leave everything as
it stands have you a cap yes-
good

  the bewildered mr campbell felt
that he was in competent hands and
followed the major to the elevators
without a protest

  see me to the ground floor my
friend the major suggested loudly
pulling campbell into the crowded ele-
vator with him they shot down and
at the second floor the car stopped
when the two slipped out quickly they
then took the stairs more rapidly than
campbell imagined the portly derm-
stott could travel and in a few seconds
were on the street and in a waiting
taxi

  drive fast my man and land us at
the fourth avenue subway downtown
side in three minutes they were on
an express and in a few minutes more
they alighted at fourteenth street im-
mediately boarding a local which


the popular magazine

passed three stations before the major
took his companion to the upper air

  we shall now secure a taxi and re-
pair to the wells fargo express com-
pany office and get your pound of ra-
dium i think we are perfectly safe
from pursuit

  just a moment major campbell
replied i want to mail this letter

  in hurriedly deserting his comforta-
ble quarters in the hotel mr campbell
had stopped to do two things the
first was to extract from his grip a
traveling cap which he handed to the
major the second vas to pick up his
daily letter to dorothy and shove it in
liis pocket

  he now bethought himself of the let-
ter and stepping to a mail box on the
corner dropped it through the slot it
was picked up by the mailman half an
hour later and doubtless left new
york that night mail deliveries in the
north end of detroit however are not
very prompt and it was not until the
second day or on the thirteenth that
dorothy received her first and only love
letter from new york

  for as it developed no other mail
arrived on lawrrence avenue for dor-
othy simms from douglas campbell
and by the sixteenth the little lady was
almost distracted during the five
years of her engagement to douglas
campbell she had never failed to re-
ceive a daily love letter from him ex-
cept at such times as he could not get
a letter to a railway mail station for
her on such unfortunate occasions
the final delivery ahvays made up for
every delinquency as a letter for every
missing day invariably arrived it was
with a feeling of perfect certainty
therefore that the disturbed little lady
decided something very dreadful had
happened to her absent sweetheart
mai was too easily sent from every
point of new york to explain a delay
on the basis of the occasional colo-
rado delinquencies a fixed habit of
five years could not be so easily broken
either

  convinced in her own mind after the
second day of waiting she nevertheless
hesitated to express her fears so

 quickly on the third day however
 her fears overcame her diffidence and
 when the eleven-oclock delivery
 brought no letter from new york she
 hastened to her uncle josiah inter-
 rupting that gentleman in an attempt
 to administer a much-needed bath to
 a struggling yapping fox terrier

   hello dorothy give a hand here
 washings a womans work-always
 was ellen refuses wish i had
 oh uncle come in the house at
 once wont you ive something seri-
 ous to tell you and i cant attempt it
 with that dog yelling and jumping
 around please uncle josiah

   why certainly dot glad to oblige
 dogs sure to go roll in the garden
 anyhow come right in

  the two entered the long cool
 library

   uncle something dreadful has hap-
 pened to douglas i can give you rea-
  sons a womans reason and logical rea-
 sons you know he writes me every
 day of his life well it is now the
 sixteenth and he left on the tenth i
 received just one letter three days ago
 i dont have to point out to a psycholo-
 gist like yourself that habits of five
 years are not suddenly broken in six
 days moreover i have a premonition
 that is stronger than logic he is sick
 injured or-but t wont even think
 of the worst but its one of the three
 there there dot im an old man
  and dont know much but i know
 campbell and i know you you are
 perfectly right if he were just an
 ordinary poor chap i wouldnt give your
 premonitions a second thought but he
 isnt not by a long shot let me see
 the letter

   i neednt show it all uncle only
 the first page contains everything you
 want to see replied dorothy blushing
 faintly

   course course grunted the old
 man hand over the first page then
 he carefully adjusted his large spec-
 tacles and read

   my darling dorothy its all right the
 major has written me a letter which i found
 on my arrival here saying that lie lias made
 all arrangements and will have the money
the campbells are coming



for me by three oclock to tell you the
truth i have felt he was either kidding me
or playing for effect until i read his letter
its a business letter and right to the point
im not to stir out till i hear from him or
see him well that much is settled ill
plank the money in the bank just as soon
as the deal is closed and then hike to wash-
ington if everything turns out as well there
as it has here i shall return a public bene-
factor and you may marry a celebrity just
as soon as you like get your picture in the
paper maybe

  the major writes that he expects to leave
town to-night so i assume he means that
he is leaving for washington then if he
does i shall doubtless accompany him for
he has promised to be of assistance in get-
ting at the powers that be in any event i
shall go  to was ngton to-night if every-
thing turns out as i expect you will there-
fore hear from me to-morrow from the
tourainc the majors headquarters in wash-
ington unless you get a wire from me to
the contrary

  i wish yon were along my dearest the
last three days were won-

 ilum commented mr simms
peering over bis glasses thats all
thats important is it  well there are
several things i dont understand
first who is this major and what is
the reference to the money

  the major is a german he met on
the train his name is major derm-
stott and he lives at the hotel tou-
raine in washington i forget his first
name although douglas told me he
offered to buy a pound of radium from
douglas and pay him two millions for
it

  certainly a bargain must be worth
over five times as much now what
does this washington business mean
public-benefactor pose and all that

  why i thought he had told you
he proposed to turn over to the gov-
ernment his invention for creating
cheap power he wants to see the
common people benefit and not a few
rich monopolists

  shades of utopia exclaimed the
old man why didnt the blithering
misguideddreamer tell me that he
hasnt a chance in the world could
have told him in a minute and fixed
it for him to the queens taste well
well theres nothing like being young
or in love now tell me did he in-

form you just how much he told this
german 

  i dont know i was interested in
the big lot of money he expected to
secure for his radium of course but
you know there were a lot of things
more important than what he said to
some german and what some german
might have said to him

 hum grunted mr simms i
reckon so well well this looks seri-
ous dot i only hope he didnt say
anything about those explosions to any
german major but dont you worry
ill go right after this don quixote
myself leave for washington imme-
diately anybodys safe in newt york
superstition to the contrary nobody
safe in washington much less a big
innocent yokel with a secret greater
than the european war go on right
home quit worrying telegraph you
every day oftener maybe just leave
it to your uncle josiah aint dead
yet-not by a long shot there there 
dont cry everything will be all
right

  its all right uncle im crying
from pure relief i was afraid you
wouldnt understand but youre a
dear

  thats all right too old for hood-
winking my dear ive got to hustle
ellen ellen  i say he yelled reliev-
ing the tension considerably pack my
bag instantly goin to washington
first train miss dorothy will tell you
when to expect me back

  ellen assured instant action the
old man kissed dorothy good-by and
rapidly changed his clothes instead
of his slippers he donned a pair of
elastic-sided congress gaiters for his
shining nankeen trousers he substituted
a somewhat less shiny pair he brushed
up a derby hat that weber or fields
would have paid fifty dollars to possess
and completed his toilet by tying a
long thin string bow tie around his
long thin neck as he slipped into his
flapping black alpaca coat ellen
brought down his bag and in five min-
utes he was aboard a street car for the
railroad station

  the scurrying mr simms made the


the popular magazine

twelve-fifty-five train with but a mo-
ment or two to spare arriving in wash-
ington the next morning at eight-
twenty-six he repaired at once to the
hotel touraine and after registering
asked for the manager despite the
laughable appearance of the little man
his requests were always met with
quick atenlion by servants who seemed
to recognize an air of authority they
were at a loss to explain in the pres-
ent instance he was ushered into the
managerial presence with alacrity

  what may i do for you inquired
that imposing individual

  i should like to know whether there
was registered here on the eleventh
twelfth or subsequent thereto a west-
erner by the name of douglas camp-
bell if not please ascertain whether
a man of his description has been
brought here following this request
bv a full and complete outline of craw-
fords look carriage and bearing

  i shall discover at once replied
the manager pushing a button

  from the clerk who responded it was
learned that no gentleman answering
mr campbells name or description was
in the hotel

  thank you flave you had a major
dermstott asked simms

  major dermstott yes we have
had such a guest he has not been
here for over a month but his wife
gave up their apartment only a few
days ago on what day  was that
jules he inquired of the still waiting
clerk

  she left on the seventh of the
month sir replied jules

  ah murmured the little old man
i wish you would tell me something
of this mr dermstott

  the major arrived early in the
spring of  and has spent intervals
here of more or less duration from then
to now i can tell you very little about
him except to say that he is a most
affable and entertaining gentleman and
received manv german callers

  thank you very much said josiah
simms retiring with every evidence of
a fixed but sudden purnose

  he took a taxi at the door and in a

few minutes had launched his card on
its devious way to the secretary of
state in a remarkably short time he
was shown with marked respect into the
presence of the secretary himself

  well well mr simms that gentle-
man greeted him warmly you do not
get down-to see us with much fre-
quency of late you had a hard row
to hoe last september but  am pleased
to have this opportunity of thanking
you in person our operatives reported
the tremendous odds but were unani-
mous in praise for the results accom-
plished in spite of everything

  we didnt have a chance but we
threw a little scare into them at that
i havent come down to collect any
political laurels however more seri-
ous than that what do you know
about a certain major dermstott
dermstott eh major adolph
dermstott ill call in mr appelby

  appleby he said to that quickly
summoned officer shake hands with
mr josiah simms and tell him any-
thing you know about major adolph
dermstott he can be trusted

  major dermstott sir replied ap-
pleby is a man about whom i wish
i could tell you more lie has been
in a certain measure a thorn in our
sides he started out by precipitating
upon us a most uncomfortable protest
from the canadian government he
was in ottawa at the time of the de-
struction of the parliament buildings
which you of course remember there
was ever evidence at first that the
canadian government proposed to sift
that unfortunate affair to the bottom
but their entire interest stopped very
suddenly for reasons at which we can
only guess

  is the major identified with the
german embassy inquired the much-
interester visitor

  not that we know of but he is a
frequent visitor there and commands
great respect from all of the attaches
apparently we have had him under
more or less constant surveillance and
i can only regret that our efforts have
not been more successful we should
like to be in a position to hand him his
the camcpbells are coming



passports but no tangible cause has pre-
sented itself he is a most resourceful
and wily gentleman

  i had half expected to meet him in
washington do you happen to know
where he is at present inquired mr
simms

  yesterday evening he was in new
york he stops at the wilhelmstrasse
hotel when he visits the big town and
if it is important i can secure advices
as to whether he is there to-day
never mind never mind grunted
simms have you a picture of the
man

  no but you wont need one he is
a fat german with a nose hke a ham-
merhead shark dresses like a dandy
and sports a kaiser wilhelm mustache
of grayish black parts his hair in the
middle and looks pock-marked you
couldnt possibly miss him in a crowd
of ten thousand

 many thanks mr appleby i
think that will be all i need mr
simms replied with a nod of dis-
missal from the secretary mr appleby
retired

  mr secretary simms said gravely
if what i suspect is true you will be
in a position to hand the major his
passports but i shall need some help
from you will yrou please give me a
note to the proper superior in new
york cityr putting at my disposal such
men and such help as i mayr require
why of course mr simms gladly
this sounds like an important matter
you have undertaken

  it is mr secretary a young
friend of mine has disappeared and i
suspect this foreign gentleman of very
decided complicity in the matter my
friend possesses a secret that will solve
forever the bugaboo of adequate na-
tional defense at a cost of a few
million dollars he can girt the entire
country with a defense so adequate that
no invasion could possibly avail in the
slightest against it byr the touch of a
button you could sit in yrour office and
raise a curtain of fire a mile high
around the entire united states it
would continue to maintain this im-
penetrable barrier against all comers
ob p

for thirteen hundred years if necessary
at not a nickel of cost aside from the
initial installation and the damage it
would do to the surrounding country
for a mile away you wouldnt need
an army or a navy nor would you need
any war department you could do it
yourself

  my dear mr simms expostulated
the secretary of any one but you
i should suspect softening of the
brain

  no it is most serious fact i shall
briefly explain as he did so the sec-
retary expressed wonder and convic-
tion that were unmistakable

  i place this matter entirely in your
hands mr simms the department in
new york will be warned in advance
to expect you and you will find the
best men available at your beck and
call i think you shouldnt waste a
moment

  mr simms didnt except to wait for
thequickly written note for which he
had asked

  in less than three hours he was back
in new york being met at the station
by three men who escorted him to a
waiting limousine from this he
alighted a block from the wilhelm-
strasse hotel trudging on foot to that
hostelry just in time to secure his lunch
almost the first man he saw was a
large german accompanied by a strik-
ingly handsome woman dark tall and
elegantly dressed the three completed
lunch at the same moment mr simms
abbreviating his usual fletcherization
by several counts that he might retire
at the same moment as the couple in
whom he was so interested

  i shall be going out at once my
dear he heard the german announce
to the lady expect me back at four

  mr simms grabbed his funny little
derby and hastened out after the ger-
man his long coat tails flapping ludi-
crously in the wind and his thin short
legs working furiously to keep his
quarry in view as he left the hotel
entrance he signaled one of the three
men who had driven him from the sta-
tion the man threw away a perfectly


the vovulatr magazine

good cigar and crossed to the other side
of narrow broadway

  mr simms padded after the major
whose identity he couldnt doubt for a
second and as the latter ran into the
times square building the little man
was just a few steps behind him mr
simms ran to the starter and asked if a
man responding to the majors descrip-
tion had just gone up in one of the ele-
vators

  didnt see itn lot of people go up
in every car though like as not he
did it was three or four minutes be-
fore mr simms discovered there were
three other exits from the building one
to the subway a second to forty-sec-
ond street through the drug store and
the other to seventh avenue behind the
battery of elevators

  humph he murmured with dis-
gust losing my cunning well the
jig is up for the day

  on returning to broadway he looked
around for the secret-service man and
seeing nothing of him decided there
was a chance that experienced man had
been more astute than himself

  better run up to the furnald he
decided no use wasting all my time
if the dutchman did make a monkey
of me

  at the hotel he discovered that mr
campbell had registered on the elev-
enth had left suddenly the same after-
noon and had not been seen since mr
simms secured the attention of the
manager who glanced at his funny
clothes and all but repressed a confi-
dence he seemed on the point of mak-
ing

  its all right speak up im his
prospective uncle something very
funny here and i want to know all
about it

  you are right sir replied the man-
ager with reserve there is some-
thing funny about this business the
gentleman takes an expensive suite
occupies it but a few hours and de-
parts following an evident disturbance
and hasnt returned since

  have you had no word of him
asked mr simms

  yes we have two in fact the

first was delivered in the form of a
note asking us to allow the bearer to
bring him some clothing as he had been
taken ill and was with friends the
other was a telephone message from
the consolidated safety deposit cor-
poration the latter wished to have
word with mr campbell as in his pay-
ment for a safety-deposit box he had
given them a spurious ten-dollar bill
whats that  whats that a
counterfeit ten-dollar bill  excuse me
but i shall return within the hour
have no concern i guarantee your en-
tire charges good day sir

  discovering that the safety-deposit
vaults were but a few blocks away the
little old man repaired thither at a fast
trot securing an audience with the
manager without delay

  yes replied that official mr
campbell secured a box at five-forty-
five the evening of the eleventh the
only size we had available wras fifteen
dollars a year and he paid with a ten
and a five-dollar note we discovered
the next day that the larger bill was
bogus it was a very good imitation
sir and was only by chance detected
the gentleman doubtless secured it un-
wittingly himself but we thought best
to advise him immediately we have
not heard from him

  did he come alone

  no he was accompanied by another
gentleman they were both in a great
hurry and as it was almost our closing
time i paid no particular attention to
either

  have you any idea what was de-
posited in the box  inquired mr
simms

  certainly not replied the manager
with some show of indignation

  of course of course grunted
simms well we must determine the
contents without a moments delay
impossible said the official emphat-
ically absolutely impossible even
granting my desire to do so our boxes
can be opened with only two keys the
master key we hold here and the other
possessed by the tenant

  humph objected mr simms it
happens i have been receiver for two
the campbells are coming



safety-deposit companies in my time
reserve your protests and kindly read
this letter

  the manager read the communica-
tion from the secretary of state with
growing respect for mr simms as he
returned the letter he was as obsequious
as a head waiter

  ah he exclaimed this puts a
different light on the matter if it is
a department investigation i think it
can be arranged do you suspect him
of being a counterfeiter sir

  it is hardly the time for me to ex-
press any opinion replied simms with
a quizzical half smile

   it is most irregular sir but i shall
make an exception in this case  of
course we have a very definite lien
against the contents of the box the
payment having been made with bogus
tender ill attend to it at once
within fifteen minutes the door be-
ing swung open the manager took the
box to a private booth where the three
peered into it there was a single in-
closure it was a cashiers check on
the hanover national bank for two
million dollars made payable to doug-
las campbell and unindorsed

  drat my cats exclaimed mr
simms in considerable surprise id
have bet a dollar to a doughnut itd be
something else

  plates maybe the manager in-
quired with ill-concealed curiosity

  maybe replied simms but tell
me do you think this check is genu-
ine 

   with no question of doubt sir the
manager asserted emphatically i was
assistant cashier in the hanover for
eleven years its as good as the wheat
i only wish it was payable to my order
what shall we do now sir 

  well put it back and lock it up
you will keep the duplicate key i
shall telephone at once for an operator
to station himself here this is a very
important matter and i trust you will
not view this request with any reluc-
tance

  not at all sir it will be a pro-
tection i shall gladly welcome on my
own account i assure you

  after arranging by telephone for the
proper secret-service guard mr simms
returned rapidly to the furnald and
again sought the manager

  your information regarding the
counterfeit bill suggested a line of ac-
tion i was somewhat precipitate in
carrying out he explained apologeti-
cally the results have upset certain
conjectures i had formed so i have re-
turned to secure a little more informa-
tion from you you spoke of a dis-
turbance that preceded mr campbells
hurried departure will you kindly ex-
plain what you meant by that

  the floor matron reported loud and
objectional talking in mr campbells
room directly thereafter two men
hurried out with every appearance of
high excitement  our guest and an-
other gentleman followed them in a
very few moments mr campbell be-
ing without a hat his companion in-
vited him to ride down to the first floor
and that was the last any one has seen
of him the floor matron reported
everything quiet within a few seconds
after her first call so the house detec-
tive took no pains to interfere

  at what time was that please 

  a very little after three oclock
hum commented mr simms
and what about this man who ap-
peared later with a note can you
show it to me

  i am sorry the messenger came
at about nine oclock after i had left
for the day the assistant manager re-
ported it to me the next morning the
gentleman was taken to the suite and
stayed there but a few moments while
a bell boy stood at the door he topk
the note with him

  i must examine that room at once
sir ordered mr simms i think this
letter will serve as a sufficient guaran-
tee of my intentions

  after reading the letter the manager
thawed visibly

  in just a second sir he promised
with a bow i shall secure the key
and personally conduct you there

  the twro entered the room a few
minutes later when mr simms care-
fully examined every drawer and re-


the popular magazine

ceptacle expressing disappointment
over his inability to locate the object
for which he searched with such dili-
gence

  please see that no one disturbs any-
thing i shall pay the amount due my-
self and you may hold the room as it
is for two or three days unless you
receive instructions from me to the con-
trary

  very good sir the-manager re-
plied i hope we have laid ourselves
open to no particular censure

  something extremely important is
missing but i have no means of know-
ing whether mr campbell took it with
him or whether it was extracted later
in any event i can see no possible cause
for blaming the management

  thank you sir replied the man-
ager we shall see that your orders
are carried out to the letter

 leaving the furnald mr simms
trudged back to the wilhelmstrasse
rather tired in body and considerably
perplexed in mind as he entered his
room he found awaiting him the opera-
tive he had lost sight of in the morning

  sort of lost you in the shuffle sir
the man said with a smile that
dutchman is a smooth one but by good
luck i anticipated him very nicely as
i suspected he went right through the
lobby of the times building and
boarded a seventh avenue car i fol-
lowed him in a taxi down the avenue
and saw him enter a building that looks
like a private house but which i wras
told is a sanitarium of some sort the
drug-store man on the corner had very
little of good to say of the place but
since they buy none of their supplies
of him that may be the answer to that
sir

  how long did he remain inquired
mr simms shaking oft some of his
ennui

  all of three hours and a half when
i followed him back here i made so
free as to ask for your key and make
myself at home i thought it better
than loafing around downstairs

 sure responded mr simms
have a cigar handing the secret-
service man a long black stogie the

latter viewed the offering with some
mistrust but out of politeness at-
tempted its consumption between
splutters he continued 

  major dermstott goes to the place
every afternoon sir the neighbors
report that the nurses are all men and
germans they have seen no ambu-
lance draw up for a number of days
they were of the opinion that the place
is doing very little business in spite
of the three or four male nurses in
constant attendance

  that sounds interesting com-
mented mr simms we shall have
dinner here in my room if you would
care to join me and to-morrow morn-
ing we shall stage a little action

  the action became a reality at nine
oclock the next morning a huge
seven-passenger touring car came tear-
ing up lower seventh avenue at a
dangerous rate of speed directly op-
posite an old three-story building with
white curtains at every window an old
man with a cane attempted to cross the
street in front of the approaching ma-
chine excited yells of warning arose
from the sidewalks the car attempted
to veer to the right when with a united
groan from the horrified pedestrians
the old man fell headlong and lay white
and still in the middle of the street

  with grinding brakes the car stopped
within its length a little man with a
flapping alpaca coat jumped nimbly
from the seat beside the driver quickly
followed by four other men from the
tonneau behind a heavy robe wa
thrown over the fallen man who was
carried quickly to the sidewalk where
the evident owner of the car ran among
the fast-increasing crowd asking for in-
formation regarding the nearest doctor

  days a lot o doctors in dere sir
a small urchin volunteered pointing to
the house with curtained windows the
excited little man directed his com-
panion to carry the victim within im-
mediately and crowding back the curi-
osity seekers the four men flanked by
the chauffeur and mr simms carefully
deposited their stricken burden on the
top step and rang the bell

 the summons was answered by a
the campbells are coming



burly german dressed in a hospital or-
derlys uniform who permitted the in-
vasion of the sanitarium with ill-con-
cealed reluctance

  this man has just been run over
and has been badly hurt one of the
men explained call your doctor at
once

  the herr doctor is but eating his
breakfast below bring the patient this
way and shut the door on that mob
the orderly snapped he led the way
through a hall that bisected the build-
ing from front to rear on either side
of which were rooms with hospital beds
but all apparently empty a small op-
erating room showed at the rear on
the right and as the orderly preceded
the men with their wounded burden
he quickly closed the door opposite the
operating room which clicked with a
patent lock

  as mr simms brought up the rear
he noticed this maneuver and quickly
slipping into the room adjoining found
the communicating entrance unlocked
he cautiously opened the door and saw
a man either asleep or desperately ill
he was lying on his side with his face
away from the door and the agile mr
simms tiptoed softly to the bed and
peered over the sleeping head

  with a shrill whistle he announced
the success of his discovery when the
room was quickly filled by the five men
followed by their erstwhile victim
dragging the large auto robe behind
him the real patient was quickly
wrapped in the warm robe tenderly
lifted from the hospital bed and rap-
idly carried to the front door

  as the orderly witnessed these re-
markable proceedings he had retreated
downstairs yelling at the top of his
voice and cursing in german in a man-
ner doubtless worthy of all praise as
the party reachcd the door they found
it locked and barred but with a short
iron bar carried in under his coat the
chauffeur smashed the glass and splin-
tered the fastenings in short order
four men rushed up from the base-
ment but on finding themselves con-
fronted by drawn revolvers threw up
their hands

  this game is up my friends get
down to the cellar where you belong
the first man to make a hostile move
will be shot like a crow git mr
simms uttered this parting shot as the
men carried his friend down the steps
and through a wildly curious crowd
upon the sidewtalk the sick man was
propped as comfortably as possible in
the back seat two men got in behind
leaving two others to disperse the
crowd to one mr simms directed
telephone the manager of the fur-
nald that were on our way tell him
to send up doctor boughton to mr
campbells suite

  doctor boughton and the manager
himself were awaiting the arrival of
the party and a trained nurse stood by
the bathroom door the stricken man
was quickly put to bed between warm
blankets and carefully examined by the
physician

  unconscious from the administra-
tion of some narcotic heart action
and pulse very fair and not at all
alarming insufficient feeding also ap-
parent ill just give him a weak hypo-
dermic and feel sure he will recover
consciousness w-ithin an hour i will
order some stimulating broth which
you will give as i shall direct miss
gay i shall return by ten-thirty but
should he arouse in the meantime give
him the broth and a tablespoon of this
medicine and allow him to go back to
sleep on no account must he be dis-
turbed as the doctor gave these di-
rections he prepared to leave

  just a minute doctor pleaded mr
simms when will you allow him to
talk it is vitally important

  the only important thing to him
is recovery  nothing is very impor-
tant to a dead man you will kindly
follow my directions explicitly he
may be able to talk for a few moments
to-morrow but i can tell about that
much better this afternoon

  mr simms immediately cleared the
room and retired to the ground floor
to his niece he sent a telegram

  douglas found been ill but doctor says
everything all right


the popular magazine

  having carefully verified the pre-
scribed number of words he paid for
the message and returned to camp-
bells sitting room where he paced up
and down with worried fretful steps
twice within the hour he was shooed
from the door of the bedroom by the
nurse and as he was about to make a
diird attempt the telephone bell tinkled

  come right up to his sitting room
ill have the door open dont make
a sound mr simms whispered into
the receiver

  the operative who had shadowted the
major the day before entered in a few
seconds

  big fire at the wilhelmstrasse ho-
tel mr simms he reported started
in major dermstotts suite i was sta-
tioned at the rear fire escape on that
floor when i heard a terrific explosion
from the direction of the majors
rooms each suite is separate and fire-
proof but from the heat i expected the
whole building to crumble in i slid
down the fire escape to the floor below
and gave an alarm but before the de-
partment could get there the show was
over every last thing in that suite
was burned to a cinder and the entire
water supply from cellar to garret put
on the bum like a flash i was the
first man in after the steam escaped
and the place wras less like a furnace
in the bathroom i found about enough
of the major to wad a shotgun his
wife almost as bad in the adjoining
bedroom winds up that end of the
business i guess

  has any one discovered the cause
of the fire inquired mr simms
tensely

  nope replied the operative but
i noticed something very queer in the
bathroom there is a funny little metal
box behind the bathtub shooting sparks
like a pinwheel it was too hot to
touch and i hurried up here to see
what you might think about it i dont
think any one else noticed it and the
suite has been roped off and one of our
men placed on guard its too hot in
there now to hold any inquest for some
hours and if you want anything done
there is plenty of time

  do you know any place we may
have a small lead box made  mr
simms asked excitedly also where
we may secure a pair of aluminum
pincers 

  right over on seventh avenue we
can get a lead box made and the italian
that runs the joint will know where to
get the aluminum all right i never
saw him stumped on any metal job
yet

  then let us get there at once mr
simms ordered

  mr simms secured a lead box with
a tight cover after a half hours wait
and the aluminum pincers were also
found for him by the metal worker rec-
ommended by the operative with
these they hastened to the wilhelm-
strasse the two had no difficulty in
securing access to the dermstott suite
the devastation of which aroused the
little mans wonder and astonishment

  behind the remains of the bathtub
mr simms had no difficulty in find-
ing campbells missing box of alloy
with the small cap gone with the
aluminum pincers he gingerly trans-
ferred it to the lead box he had taken
the trouble to have prepared wrapping
the small package in a piece of asbestos
cloth he had also procured on the way

  as the two were about to retire they
were interrupted by the arrival of an-
other secret-service man the latter
held in his hands a coat and vest pecul-
iarly entwined about a framelike object
which closer inspection clearly showed
to be the top of a straight-backed chair

  one of our men found this across
the alley in a yard behind the hotel
the officer explained there is an
envelope in one of the vest pockets ad-
dressed to the unfortunate victim of
this explosion sir it is quite evident
that he had put his coat and vest over
a chair near the window and by some
strange freak of the explosion the top
of the chair was blown through the
window together with the clothing

  the astonished mr simms grabbed
the clothing and drawing the envelope
from the vest pocket perused the con-
tents with growing excitement he
carefully returned the papers after
the camfbells are coming



reading and stowed them away in the
capacious pocket of his alpaca coat

  gentlemen mr simms said turn-
ing to the operatives you have per-
formed a service i shall not fail to em-
phasize in my report to your superior
as well as to washington itself your
intelligent and faithful work has been
efficient and commendable in the high-
est degree whatever remains to be
done now will be purely formal i take
it upon myself to assure you of that
fact now that you may give the proper
hints to the man on duty when the
civil authorities request any informa-
tion just turn the job over to them
with as much innocent fiction as your
conscience will allow i must be get-
ting back to my boy so good-by to you
i shant forget

  i guess i understand mr simms
replied the older of the two with gen-
uine feeling i never liked working
with anybody so well in my life ill
stick around and see that everything is
taken care of properly

  the pleased little man hastened back
to the furnald he learned the doctor
had called finding douglas campbell
awake and much stronger than he had
expected to find him the physician
had left word with the nurse that mr
campbell might talk for a short time
about ten the next morning unless some
unexpected development occurred

  this interval of waiting seemed to
the nervous mr simms an eternity
but as he met doctor boughton the next
morning the latter assured him that he
need contain himself but a few mo-
ments longer

  ill go in now as he will be awake
in a few moments miss gay advises
me that he has been consuming nour-
ishment at a tremendous rate and that
his wonderful constitution has thrown
off practically all of the narcotics ef-
fects just be patient for about fifteen
minutes

  with a smile of condescension that
irritated the fussy little old gentleman
to the point of blasphemy the doctor
entered the patients bedroom and
closed the door behind him the fifteen
minutes stretched themselves to half

 an hour but at last he appeared be-
 fore the much perturbed air simms

   you may talk with him now he is
 bright as a dollar and hungry as a coy-
 ote you will find him more interested
 in his food than in you probably but
 you may have an hour

   when can he be moved doctor
 inquired mr simms

   well if you want to take miss gay
 along ill let you ship him to-morrow
 or next day at the latest it will take
 more than a railroad journey to kill
 that young man

   before the physician finished speak-
 ing mr simms padded into the room
 unceremoniously ejected the nurse
 closed the door and locked it

   well douglas my boy he affec-
 tionately addressed the patient who
 was ravenously devouring the last
 crumbs of moistened toast from the
 bottom of a large bowl of soup took
 your uncle josiah to save your bacon
 for you eh  suppose you start in
 and tell me the story learned a few
 of your exciting peregrinations but
 there are a lot of gaps

   i am glad you got here mr simms
 i certainly need some advice if i ever
 needed it in my life dorothy hasnt
 learned any of the scandal yet -has
 she 

   god bless my soul you havent been
 lady-killing too have you

   ill have to let you judge mr
 simms the young man sighed if
 youll just move that warm broth a
 trifle nearer ill start at the beginning
 he took the entranced mr simms
 from his arrival at the detroit station
 to the point of leaving the subway four
 stations jieyortd fourteenth street he
 was interrupted but very little and cov-

	ered the ground quickly

   we took a taxi there he continued
 after another cup of broth and drove
 to the wells fargo office i had no
 difficulty in identifying myself and
 with the package of radium the major
 took me to a very large testing labora-
 tory not very far from there where
 the chief laboratory assistant assured
 him my radium was absolutely the first
 in a pure metal state ever submitted to


the popular magazine

him and a few grains over one pound
troy weight

  the major then handed me a cash-
iers check on the hanover national
bank for two millions he left the
radium with the head of the institution
giving him directions for shipping it i
didnt hear it was then almost five
oclock and the major suggested that
he take me to a quiet and rather ob-
scure hotel he knew of where we
should have dinner and where i might
stay until he had fully investigated the
plans of the blackmailers i objected
to carrying around even a check of
such size as i had already begun to
mistrust my ability to keep out of the
clutches of these high-handed grafters
down here i insisted on banking the
check but since it was too late for that
the major suggested a safety-deposit
vault from the telephone directory
we chose the nearest one and went
there

 have you any idea where you
picked up a counterfeit ten-dollar bill 
mr simms inquired they are look-
ing for you down there on that ac-
count

  what  yelled campbell as lustily
as possible i havent committed mur-
der too have i mr simms

  cant say yet mr simms replied
with a broad grin they say troubles
never come singly but you can for-
get that counterfeit bill its been made
good go on with your story

  well we took a taxi quite a dis-
tance through a rather poor part of
town and at last pulled up at a build-
ing i should know again at once but
as to where it is located i havent an
idea it smelled of drugs on the first
floor but we were shown up to the sec-
ond where a very comfortable sitting
room and bedroom looked on the street
the major ordered a fine dinner which
we finished off with a special wine he
said the place was noted for i became
exceedingly sleepy long before my usual
time to retire so turned in about eight
oclock the major leaving with a prom-
ise to look me up the first thing in the
morning but i was sick all the next
day

  well the doctor showed up and
while the major stood by he talked
learnedly and made a lot of funny
passes i knew at once he wtas trying
to hypnotize me but it didnt worry
me a bit i used to go to seances and
none of them ever got farther than
making me laugh they didnt give
me much to eat though and the second
or third day moved me downstairs to
a regular hospital room the doctor
and the major showed up every after-
noon but by that time i was too weak
to care or talk id go to sleep while
the svengali person was doing his best
i dont know how long i was there
and cant tell you anything more that
i think you would like to know give
me some more soup please

  i forgot about that box of alloy
i gave the major a note before we
had dinner that night directing the
hotel to allow him to bring me some
clothing as i didnt have an extra thing
not even a hat he must have had
some object in desiring to search my
rooms but what he could have expected
to find is a mystery he must have
taken off my box of alloy of course
but what he expected to learn from it
is certainly beyond me

  well my boy responded mr
simms if youll just cast your inno-
cent gaze over these papers that were
found after the explosion a good many
things will be a little more clear to your
unsuspecting comprehension

  as the bewildered patient read the
report of no  his face was a study
and his perusal of the other documents
completed his astonishment

  well what do you think about
that he exclaimed these astonish-
ing exhibits certainly make a number
of things very clear dont they it is
now very evident that mr dermstott
stole the box for a very specific pur-
pose it is evident however that his
curiosity proved his undoing as i can
easily enough guess what happened
he doubtless elected to examine the
box while preparing for a bath and
bv some mischance dropped it into the
bathtub after removing the cap if
the water happened to be running either
the campbells are coming



in or out that would be enough to ex-
plain the explosion the force of the
steam would be more than sufficient to
throw the box out of the tub and the
cap was probably blown into the wall
the force of those explosions is some-
thing terrific

  yes i know replied the old man
soberly i saw what it can do there
is another thing however that took me
to washington hotfoot if you had
had enough sense to consult me about
your chimerical dream of turning over
your discovery to the government i
could have saved you a lot of trouble
you would have spent the rest of your
life and all of your two millions trying
to get that across in washington the
power barons of this country would
have stopped your clock so effectually
you would never have suspected it was
failing to run right on time every min-
ute you didnt have a chance on
earth

  but it has been done hasnt it
inquired the surprised mr campbell

  once mr simms replied dryly
we got a government-owned railway
in alaska and it looked for a while
as though the busy congressmen had
had one put over on them but-well
i shant go into that you may take
my word for it that a lot of very power-
ful private interests have been very
profitably served on account of it al-
ready

  but mr simms it is the dream of
my life what can i do

  consult your uncle josiah of
course we can rig up a little eleemo-
synary foundation that wtill work like
a charm we shall have a few injunc-
tion suits probably but the objectors
or their backers have unwittingly given
us all the law and opinions we shall
need to knock the props from under
them when the time comes if that is
all that worries you lie back and go to
sleep ill get right on the job

  well there is one thing that bothers
me a lot what am i going to do about
that threatened mann-act prosecution 
its bound to ruin me for life win or
lose

  eh whats that spluttered mr

simms i guess not by the way did
your smooth lady friend have a little
red birthmark just below her right
temple and a little black beauty spot
on her chin 

  yes i think she did im sure about
the mole and seem to recollect a little
cherry birthmark such as you de-
scribe

  well then your innocent young life
hasnt been ruined yet replied mr
simms the majors wife answered
that description so its extremely im-
probable that her shadow or that of
her suppositious husband mr dem-
ing will ever fall across your path
again i forgot to mention it but the
explosion that sent the major to his
reward thoughtfully removed his lady
at the same instant

  thank god breathed campbell
with the look of a man who has just
escaped drowning when does the
doctor say we may leave

  he said you might be taken home
to-morrow or next day if the trained
nurse was taken along

  no yelled campbell fire her
on the spot and get a male nurse well
take no chances women are apt to be
funny well leave to-morrow night
and i say uncle send a telegram to
dorothy at once will you please  say
the campbells are coming do it
right away wont you 

  all right douglas i guess my
hours more than up anyhow ive sent
for the manager of the safety-deposit
vault and hell be here in a few mo-
ments to secure your authorization to
open the box and deliver the check to
us here well then be all set and can
get out as soon as we are ready go
to sleep ill make all arrangements
mr simms hastened below and
securing a telegraph blank wrote

  the campbells are coming

  only four words he grumbled
just because hes a plutocrat is no
reason for handing it to the telegraph
barons ill fill it out myself

  the amended telegram was carefully
verified paid for and sent as follows
the campbells are coming-hungry as

author of il waring of sonoratr-n   the amazing tenderfoot etc

                pete finds himself suffering from too much prosperity
                and takes characteristic measures to relieve his condition

  ndigo pete erstwhile local bad
man for the mohave desert and
vicinity had recently experienced
a great longing- to return to the
devious and unparliamentary ways of
his former career his position as
foreman of the hopper ranch offered
no greater excitement at best than the
breaking of an occasional bronc a bear
hunt in the distant white hills or a
chest-to-chest argument with some new
puncher who imagined perchance that
because pete didnt say much that he
didnt mean it when he said it and
these mild diversions to a man of petes
appetite were about as novel as water
is to a fish and as a crown to his
sorrow was the realization that he had
been sober so long that he had for-
gotten what a headache felt like pete
did not long for a headache but he was
willing to assume the risk for the sake
of the preliminaries sheer perversity
of will warring against continual well-
being urged him to invent an excuse
to ride to daggett and start something
as a counterbalance to this most nat-
ural perversity weighed the knowledge
that he had a comfortable bank account
a vacation coming whenever he chose
to ask for it and the best string of
ponies in the county the thing was
too easy he groaned inwardly as he
realized that he was becoming a decent
citizen in spite- of himself his red
past had faded to a domestic pink and
the future promised nothing brighter in
the way of diversion than the bucolic
gray of infinity

  he leaned against the corral bars
and gazed at the notches in his gun

his sagging sardonic eyelid half veil-
ing a mournful eye that amazing ten-
derfoot henry wordsworth hopper
had tamed him pete had to admit it

as for airs hopper--pete sighed

he would have joined the church to
please her or made any other sacrifice
compatible with his doglike adoration
for that titian-haired and altogether
lovely lady he wras her lean and
weather-beaten slave sighing again
he took mental stock of his possessions
sometimes such a review served to as-
suage his spiritual loneliness there
were his ponies an excellent lot and
among them a thoroughbred a present
from airs henry hopper then there
were saddles and trappings such as de-
light the cow-punchers heart-a large
aggressive gold watch an ivory-han-
dled gun a bundle of stock certificates
in the bank at daggett and hidden in
the farthest recesses of his trunk in
the bunk house were his evening
clothes true he had never worn
them but the mere fact that he pos-
sessed them filled him wtith a sort of
reverential awe of them-and of him-
self he never knew just why he pur-
chased such raiment although he re-
membered quite well the condition he
was in when he made that astounding
purchase which was possibly the expla-
nation of it but even the knowledge
that he secretly possessed a dress suit
failed to awaken joy in his melancholy
heart and the secret of its being
would have died with pete had it not
been for the alohave woman but the
arrival at that moment of ruddy web-
ster with a message from the mines
invigo petes guacrcdeen



for henry hopper drove all thought
of evening raiment from petes mind

  pete acknowledged ruddys presence
with a nod ruddy looked too cheerful
and heartily pleased with himself to
appeal to pete

  whats on yore mind  queried
ruddy swinging down and squatting
beside his old friend

  nothin but me hat said pete
rather viciously

  ruddy smiled to himself but main-
tained a gravity of manner that ex-
pressed sympathy yore liver all
right pete 

  was when i seen it last replied
pete

  ruddy winked at his horse pete
will you do somethin for me-some-
thin i wouldnt ask no other man to
do but you 

  pete was taken off his guard
sure he- growled

then jest please to lovinly and
trustfully go plumb to hell and write
me how you like it when you git there
petes grim face relaxed this was
like old times

  i aint had a fightin chance to cuss
for a month pete complained im
gettin tongue-tied from talkin polite
why it got so bad yesterday i just
rid out there a piece and practiced on
the scenery which sure needs cussin
but shucks im clean forgettin how
to cuss and it didnt do no good
jest like shootin holes in the air and
never hittin anything and then i run
onto mrs henry as i was cornin back
she said she seen me settin my cayuse
out there lookin poetical at the lizard
butte and that she come out to take
a look jest like i done she said she
reckoned i was jest revelin in the
landscape did i say yes maam i
did now wouldnt that fade yore
shirt 

  not mine replied ruddy i aint
no ladies pet like you wearin a blue
shirt cause somebody says its beconi-
in to my hoss

  pete swore long and eloquently
-which seemed to do him good and
its hell when they aint nothin to cuss
at he concluded

  you got a lookin-glass aint you
pete ignored the soft impeachment
ruddy yawned pete youre sufferin
from too much prosperity you want
to shake loose and blow in a few of
your accumulatin wealth poker or
liquor or somethin is what you need
youre dead in the shell honest you
look sick

  well i aint growled pete

  and you ought to see a doc i
know one in daggett

  you talk like i didnt mebby
youll tell me next where the bar is
ruddy grinned im willin to show
you

  pete eyed his companion suspiciously
you mean it

  ruddy got to his feet do you 
for answer pete stepped stealthily
to the stable ruddy grinned pres-
ently pete appeared leading a fine bay
thoroughbred saddled and bridled as
through for a fiesta wtith his finger to
his lips pete stalked to the back of the
stables ruddy followed leading his
horse a far-away look dwelt in indigo
petes eyes the hue of domestic pink
in which his vision had so lately been
submerged promised to give way to the
more blushful hue of immediate adven-
ture

  he was doing nothing wrong in leav-
ing for daggett without notice to his
employer but he felt as though he were
which served the purpose

  several miles out from the ranch
buddy reined in suddenly say pete
i plumb forgot that message for
hank

  pete scowled to turn back now
would take the edge off his glowing an-
ticipations what was it he queried

  monty said to tell hank that the
water was getting low he aint gettin
enougli to wash his hands in which
means hes got to lay off the men
that all huh youre a stock-
holder in the indigos chance aint
vou 

  well i reckon

  and i got a quarter interest aint
i

  sure 

  well right here is where we call


the popular magazine

a committee meetin of two and vote
to lay off till we get more wtater the
other stockholders not tjfin present
dont vote so we carries the motion
do you get me 

  yes but is that accordin to the
constitution 

  its accordin to mine-which is suf-
ferin for a drink

  course you look it but is it ac-
cordin to the constitution of these here
united states 

  petes lean face expressed a wither-
ing contempt for the question but he
chose to answer it as ruddy had as
it were passed the buck to him

  get yore hoss movin an ill tell
you about that without wtastin time
the constitution of these here united
states says that all men is born free
and equal dont it well i reckon
were jree i dont see nothin to stop
us and i likewise reckon were equal
to holdin down most anything we
bump into moreover and waivin
aside all perogatives-as hank says-
the constitution says all citizens what
aint in jail or dead is entitled to life
liberty and the pursuit of happiness
waivin aside life and liberty which
we got were livin up to that there
constitution by pursuin happiness aint
we 

  i reckon youre right i aint seen
nothin what looks like happiness yet
but little ole happiness will have to
go some when we git dost enough to
take our ropes down and go after her
and speakin of funerals did you buy
that hoss for his looks or jest because
he was gentle an you was afraid of
gettin throwed ridin a real cow hoss 
pete grazed across at ruddy with
murder in his eye what he said to
that happy individual would have
shocked the sensibilities of a white-
chapel coster which is all that need
be said of petes unbridled ability to
express himself when warmed up to it
the sage withered in the immediate
vicinity and a lizard shriveled and
rolled over on his back and lemme
tell you concluded pete wiping the
moisture from his corrugated brow
the hoss im ridin was give to me

by a lady that no red-headed cow-
punch livin can make slightin re-
marks about without gettin hurt where
he lives

  ruddy grinned why didnt you
tell me marion hopper give you that
hoss  think im a mind reader 
what im gettin at is that if you want
to git to daggett afore the bank closes
you got to fan it course mebby you
got a wad on yrou but i aint i aint
got the price of a ham sandwich

  an you got the nerve to ride over
and ask me to go to town with you and
git full jest for that im goin to
leave you where you wras raised and
where you belong-right out here with
the coyotes and tarantulas and suchlike
insects yah-hoo and pete set his
spurs in the thoroughbred and was a
long jump ahead of ruddy before the
other knew what had happened the
thoroughbred could run ruddy ad-
mitted that as he swung his quirt and
tried to overtake pete who had turned
and was mocking him writh a gesture
which necessitated the use of the sep-
arated fingers and thumb of his free
hand a gesture which pete made
doubly offensive by calling into use his
bridle hand as his horse swung across
the sand at top speed all would have
been well-as some one once said-if
petes horse not desert bred had seen
the gopher hole before he put his foot
in it

  pete was in no position to anticipate
the next move which he made without
hesitation the horse turned over in
a flashing arc and pete found himself
sitting on the sand several yards ahead
of the horse and that much nearer
daggett he wanted to swear but he
lacked the necessary air pressure in-
stead he spat sand from his teeth and
rose stiffly the thoroughbred unin-
jured but frightened began to run
ruddy tucked down to work the cow
pony slower than his aristocratic
brother on the straightaway was sec-
onds faster in turning ruddys rope
whistled and seethed through the air
the thoroughbred came up with a jerk
ruddyr sat back as pete limped up
yore hoss mister
indigo petes uguicrcdeenn



 this crowning impudence was too
much for pete yore hoss mister
without a word pete gathered up the
reins and mounted anger could not
express his feelings nor anger gar-
nished with profanity pete was in-
dignant too indignant at the moment
to realize that he had first played the
fool a sprained thumb was the least
of his troubles he was literally at
bay and being at heart a good sport
he acknowledged the corn

  i aim to buy this hoss a pair of
glasses when we git to town he in-
formed the silence then i reckon
ill send east and git him a set of them
snowshoes like hanks got over his
desk mebby then he kin see where
hes goin and quit tryin to git there
hind end first i got some jolt that
journey

  yore liver all right pete

  tickin as reglar as a clock i
reckon my heart lost a couple of beats
although it was workin when i swal-
lered it

 you sure done yourself proud
said ruddy when you started to
climb i could see daggett atween you
and the hoss and afore you made the
turn and started down  agin i could
see the spanish peaks i was jest goin
to ride back and tell the folks when
you lit that fall would a killed a
tenderfoot

 pete nodded gravely only thing
whats worryin me is i lit on my
thumb its stiffer than a knot on a
dead log and i caint hold a glass or
pull a gun nohow

  dont you worry about that cause
i kin do yore drinkin for you and
you aint goin to need no gun you
aint got no gun on you anyhow
pete reined in his holster was
empty hank gimme that gun he
said as he swung round and loped back
to where he had made the grand dis-
play ruddy watched him with open
appreciation as he swung down with-
out stopping and picked the gun from
the sand

  ole petes a long ride from bein a
dead one yet muttered ruddy

  look at it exclaimed pete dis-

gustedly as he displayed a swyollen and
upright thumb

  all you got to do is act like char-
ity asserted ruddy jest keep yore
right hand from knowin what your
left hand is doin-and i never seen a
one-armed man yet what couldnt take
a drink

  pete actually smiled ruddy rode
up until their knees touched lemme
look at that hook of yourn huh
out of jint and yore plumb scared to
pull it back agin like that ind
before pete knew what had happened
he heard his thumb joint click and
ruddy was grinning at him

  as usual pete hid his gratitude be-
neath the rawhide folds of expletive
but his thumb and hand felt easier
and daggett glimmering on the hori-
zon was nearer petes watch told
him that it was half past two they
could not reach town in time to cash
a check in the bank and for domestic
reasons pete did not wish to apply for
funds to an individual having in mind
the shrewrdness of his employer henry
hopper in tracing lurid events to their
definite sources it was one thing to
ride into town and accept entertainment
of chance-met friends and another
thing to deliberately and soberly bor-
row cash wherewith to start some-
thing

  but petes luck had changed the
first person he met in daggett was an
erstwhile companion from the mines
who owed pete a small matter of some
eighty dollars and who much to petes
astonishment insisted upon paying it
there and then

  their horses stabled ruddy and in-
digo sought the barber shop as an actor
seeks the dressing room to make up for
his nightly performance they hated
to do it but felt that they had to

  shaved brushed and outwardly gar-
nished they stepped to the street
lets eat said ruddy anticipating in
a measure the soundness of safety
first

  id kind of like to wash the sand
out of my back teeth said pete

  how much sand queried ruddy
suspiciously


the popular magazine

  all that i didnt spit out or swaller
and my thumb is sure hurtin

  all right one drink on the sand
and one on the thumb then we eat
suits me but this here thumb is
good for two drinks most any time
nope not till we eat

  tete scowled prodigiously look
here rud whos buyin them drinks 
they aint no sand in my back
teeth said ruddy and i aint so
blisterin dry that i thought i could
beat my hoss into town afoot

  anyhow the bar is right handy tb
the eatin house said pete gently urg-
ing ruddy across the street

  but somehow or other liquor failed
to stir pete from his moroseness but
rather it seemed to dampen the antici-
patory ardor that had inspired him to
seek the town

  ruddy he said as they waited for
their supper theys somethin wrong
with me inside them there drinks
didnt do no good nohow or else they
aint hit bottom yet im feelin worsen
i did when we hit town

you wait said ruddy consolingly
fortified by a large order of steak
and mashed potatoes backed up by
coffee and the inevitable pie they rose
and put on their hats

  the evening was pleasant and a low
moon tinged the atmosphere with a soft
and mysterious radiance doors and
windows were open and many men
forgathered on the street talking and
laughing in corner groups or strolling
lazily from store to store

  ruddy and pete stood on the side-
walk undecided as to what to do next
they were in town and the night was
theirs entertainment offered in sev-
eral varieties still they hesitated
with the cessation of old habit they
had become as strangers to the charms
of daggett they knew that they could
have what they wanted and all they
wanted of it their expedition seemed
a failure

  i couldnt feel worse if i was dead
mourned pete

  and you couldnt look worse if
youd died of pisen was ruddys com-
forting assurance

  i wish hank was in town sighed
pete

  and his wife eh

  pete shook his head nope just
hank hes the cheerfullest cuss that
ever shed hair and he aint a drinkin
man neither but theys always some-
thin doin when he shows up seems
things got to move when he takes holt
of the reins i reckon you and me is
gettin old rud

  we sure aint gettin young you
poor sufferin coyote here i go and
bring you to town and you ack like
you was head mourner at your own
funeral first thing you know youll
be failin in love

  the idea was new to pete he had
heard of such things as falling in love
and getting married but had never in-
vestigated these possibilities at close
range say ruddy honest to gosh
how does a fella go at it to fall in
love does a fella jest jump or does
he kind of slip off the edge backward
-and nothin to grab holt of 

  sone does jumpin aint so risky
here where you goin

  pete was halfway across the street
before ruddy overtook him where
you goin  he queried startled by
petes strange manner as pete did
not reply it was only too evident that
the morose foreman of the hopper
rnch had at last made up his mind
to start something

  them drinks is beginnin to work
ruddy told himself as he followed his
companion into the adjacent saloon

  midnight discovered ruddy and pete
seated at a table in the princess cafe
and opposite them sat two waitresses
of that regal establishment enjoying
the unusual distinction of being waited
upon by one of their vestal-white sis-
ters who was still on duty although
pete and ruddy each carried weight
so to speak they were still rather diffi-
dent to the lone waitress but not so
the twain who sat in all the glory of
their good clothes and ordered sus-
tenance of great price in a manner
copied from the proprietors wife who
displayed many diamonds when dining
at her lords establishment and affected
indigo petes gurdeen



the grand air as is often the custom of
those risen from the ranks

  pete his lean face almost beaming
inquired solicitously of his feminine
companion if she reckoned she would
like another bottle of beer 

  josephine of the princess cafe was
really too embarrassed to reckon but
she took the beer

  ruddy anxious to please and not to
be outdone asked his inamorata if she
would not like to celebrate the occasion
with a little bottle of shimpane

 cleo whose american name was
lucy submitted that she was not averse
to the suggestion-but champagne was
so expensive

  ruddy waved the demurrer aside
with noble disregard of the wine list
and ordered two bottles he kicked
pete under the table as a gentle re-
minder that he had no money but
pete striving desperately to fall in love
at first sight misinterpreted the hint
and asked ruddy if he had the string-
halt

  ruddy would have blushed but there
was no margin left to blush in my
foot slipped he explained

  have another steak said pete ges-
turing toward josephines empty plate

  dont mind if i do here waiter-
ess another t- bone rare and tell the
t-sheff its for me

  would you like a little oyster
asked ruddy leaning fondly toward
cleo

  youre so comic aint he jose-
phine he ast me to have a little
oyster mebby he aint the joke

  mebby i be assented ruddy cheer-
fully i made pete laugh onct

  well you cant string my pete any
can he pete and josephine touched
petes hard-veined hand playfully

  pete jumped at this show of affec-
tion but meeting ruddys eye he re-
sumed his poise such as it was

  we got a secret asserted jose-
phine coyly inspecting petes watch
that he had glanced at-for no special
reason

  mebby we aint chirruped cleo
with a languishing glance at ruddy
aint we mr webster

  she called me pete  said indigo

proudly

  oh i know his name asserted
cleo its ruddy hes et at this
joint moren onct

  but never like this this heres
what i call some style reglar family
party--me and her and you and him
have some pie

  mag called cleo the debonair
just slip me a slab of that lemon
pie im in a hurry please

  the waitr s on duty wras about to
comply with the graceful request when
ruddy interrupted sorry to keep you
lopin up and down the track like this
lady but if you dont mind jest bring
the whole gol-durned pie itll save you
a couple more trips

  aint he the joke gurgled cleo
touching ruddys arm

  my pete aint no joke asserted
josephine surreptitiously clasping petes
defenseless thumb under the table
pete straightened and tried to look
pleased but unfortunately she had
secured the injured thumb i fell on
it blurted pete

  fell on what queried josephine
with large solicitude

  my thumb lady the one youre
squeezin

  my goodness and to think i was
that careless

  cleo having consumed one bottle of
champagne giggled to think that a
man of petes recognized ability should
fall on his thumb the idea was di-
verting and cleo giggled again

  he like to got hurt said ruddy
  do tell gurgled cleo

  you do an ill blow your light
out threatened pete glowering at
ruddy

  dont git mad dear said jose-
phine placatingly no gent ever gits
mad at a friend

  and i dont want ole pete gunnin
for me asserted ruddy ever see
him shoot

  my goodness no

  show the ladies how you kin shoot
suggested ruddy he had also con-
sumed a bottle of shimpane and the


the popular magazine

 idea of exhibiting petes prowess with
 a gun seemed logical

  i got a sore thumb apologized
pete as he jerked his gun from beneath
the table and blew out an electric-light
cluster above their heads before the
assembled sirens could scream kind
of coarse work-but when my thumb
is limber i can cut it a leetle finer

   ruddy rose to protest that one ex-
hibition was enough but petes liquid
ballast had begun to work with the
airy grace of a juggler ie tossed a
 slug across the cafe and shattered
the flower vase on the cashiers desk
then just to show that he was not
embarrassed by auditors he drew down
fine and cut the wire on a picture of
custers last stand-and custer fell
josephine frozen with terror clasped
an empty beer bottle to her ample
bosom cleo alternately screaming and
begging ruddy to stop him finally
collapsed in a semifaint his gun
empty indigo beamed on his auditors
and poured himself a glass of beer with
his left hand

   thats nothin pete assured the
 trembling josephine when im feel-

in right i kin--wheres the lady

what was waitin on us  this here
bottles gone dry

  but there was no response those
who had been on duty had vacated the
premises pete grew suspicious of the
silence and quietly reloaded his gun
he was not going to be caught unpre-
pared meanwhile the gentle cleo and
the trembling josephine had risen and
seeemed anxious to depart pete had
become suddenly quiet-almost oppres-
sively so ruddy even in his beatific
state of mind realized that pete would
bear watching

   josephine gently suggested that they
 depart she murmured something
 about turning off the lights and locking
 up as they gravitated toward the front
 door but the spring lock on the door
 had clicked in place as the waitress
 who had been on duty left in some haste
 and considerable agitation josephine
 tugged at the door too perturbed in
 spirit to think of turning the brass
 knob of the lock pete to whom free-

 dom of action was dear imagined that
 they had been deliberately imprisoned
 and that the vanished waitress had gone
 for official help he gestured to jose-
 phine to step aside and as he gestured
 with the barrel of his gun josephine
 side-stepped with alacrity pete threw
 a shot into the lock and stepping up
 jerked the door open

  we oughta turn off the lights said
cleo

  ill turn em off asserted pete
and he proceeded to shoot out the
string of clusters without delay

  as the last shot boomed some one
called from outside ruddy grasped
petes arm in the darkness the
town marshal he whispered hoarsely

  pete felt equal to a score of town
marshals but josephines tremulous
contralto suggesting that he beat it
had its influence with ruddy follow-
ing as best he could pete navigated
the darkness toward the rear door and
walked serenely into the waiting arms
of a deputy pete who had holstered
his gun stuck out his hand the dep-
uty felt something hard against his ribs
and immediately put up his hands
keep em there or ill blow the roof
off your dobe said pete and he
backed away followed by ruddy

  making a cautious detour they en-
tered the rear of the livery stable sad-
dled their horses and led them out the
back way

  on the edge of the desert pete reined
ir and glanced back at the town dag-
gett aint what she used to be he told
ruddy no chance for a gent to
spread hisself no more i reckon the
ranch is good enough for me

  itll be all right at the ranch till
some little rubber-eared deputy comes
ridin up and presents you with a bill
for grub and damages then what you
goin to do 

  pay it

  thats awful nice of you pete but
wthat about mrs henry

  pete declined to discuss that pos-
sibility if mrs henry hopper heard
of his latest exploit-well he would
have to bow to fate and confess that
his foot had slipped that is unless
in<DIGO PETE’S “GUA<R$>een

he could prove an alibi he vaguely re-
membered having asked the gentle jo-
sephine to marry him before she had
eaten that second steak or was it
cleo he had asked to marry him before
ruddy changed places with him at the
table well it didnt matter he had
asked somebody to marry him and an
alibi was his only salvation he shud-
dered as he thought of his narrow es-
cape rud he said slowly which
one was yourn 

  why the one i bought the chim-
pane for

  uhuh you goin to marry her
  hell no you loco

  i reckon so i asked mine to marry
me

  which one the one you was set-
tin with when i come in or the other
one 

  i dunno but i done it

  then said ruddy as a bright idea
overtook him we better do some
ridin

  the horses fed and rested and
headed toward home made a record
run

  two shadows wavering slightly as
they meandered toward the bunk house
mingled with the interior darkness
two horses on which the sweat was
drying in dusty streaks munched al-
falfa and dozed complacently until
dawn pete awoke to hear henry
hoppers voice calling him the fore-
man slipped from his bunk and padded
to the door have you seen anything
of ruddy queried henry popper

  sure  hes bunkin with me rode
in late last night with a message from
the mines about two-he had almost
said ladies but blinked himself awake
to add-about shuttin off the men
down to the mine count low water
ruddy didnt want to dsturb you-
late and pete yawned

  well thats all right said henry
briskly i sent for monty and told
him to shut down yesterday i couldnt
find you and happened to miss ruddy
somehow or other so monty and i held
a committee meeting and voted to lay
off the men for a while i suppose that
is satisfactory to you

  b p

  well and pete paused to give his
word weight i reckon thats what id
a said if youd ast me

  all right pete by the way mrs
henry told me to ask you up to the
house for breakfast teu ruddy to
come along with you mrs henry is
really worried about something and she
wants your advice some one tele-
phoned from daggett last night she
didnt tell me what the mes age was
but she immediately said she wanted to
talk with you

  uhuh well i sure would admire
to talk to her but i busted my thumb
yesterday dog-gone bronc stepped in
a hole and piled me

  then youll have to let her doctor
you up pete you know mrs henry
thinks a whole lot of you

  which same does me proud hey
rud wake up and shake a leg the
missus ast us up to breakfast

  ruddy deep in dreams sat up with
a start did they foller us  he que-
ried blinking up at pete

  hes dreamin of injuns ex-
plained pete

 morning ruddy and henry
hopper waved a greeting from the
doorway

  mornin hank i was cornin over

yesterday when my hoss-

  last night you mean corrected
pete i told hank all about that
it was pete done the shootin as-
serted ruddy i only said for him

to show the-

  hes sufferin in his head pete in-
terrupted his hoss stepped in a
gopher hole and pitched him thats
what made him late

  henry wordsworth hopper nodded
gravely he was not unfamiliar with
distress signals when they were so ob-
vious as those which flared in the red-
lidded eyes of ruddy and in the sallow
cheek of indigo pete that tiiey had
been up to some mischief was only too
evident but henry hopper with that
largeness of outlook which had made
him beloved by all who knew him de-
clined to recognize anything wrong with
his friends still grave he winked
slowly at the two adventurers i was


the popular magazine

in daggett last night he said casu-
ally somebody started a row in the
princess cafe about midnight i hap-
pened to be waiting in my machine for
simpson when the marshal asked me
to run round to the back door of the
cafe and hold the fort while he investi-
gated i dislike such experiences but
i could hardly refuse they have a
strange notion in daggett that i am
somewhat of a peacemaker well to
make it short i was standing at the
rear door when a rowdy ran into me
and stuck a gun in my ribs of course
i did the only thing possible especially
as he informed me politely that he
would blow the roof off my adobe if
i made a move the men got away
we secured a lamp and investigated the
cafe it was a wreck but the strange
part of it is that the rowdies who made
the disturbance used to be old friends
of mine i wont mention any names-
not even to mrs henry-because i be-
lieve in being loyal to ones friends no
matter what they do perhaps i was
a fool to pay for the damage done-
and for a most extraordinary dinner
which included several steaks oysters
beer and even champagne but as i
said the men used to be my friends
did you ever try bromo-seltzer for a
sprained thumb 

  pete blinked and coughed it might
help he admitted feebly

  make it two said ruddy my
backs hurtin like the toothache i sure
got a bad fall last night

  ill send it over right away mrs
plenry would come but unfortunately
she is in barstow this morning she
took the ten oclock train from dag-
gett

  honest to gosh hankj ruddy be-
gan but petes emotion overcame him
with a bound he grasped henry
wordsworth hopper and drew him into
the bunk house ruddy leaped from
his bunk and seized henrys free arm
the three whirled and cavorted about
the bunk house in a wild dance until
ruddy gave up and sat down with his
head clasped in both hands henry
wordsworth hopper adjusted his rai-
ment carefully i have something a
lot better than bromo-seltzer up at the
house as i said mrs henry is in

barstow-

  and henry was gone pete rubbed
his head and gazed at ruddy say
rud i reckon we need a guardeen
there you go you aint never sat-
isfied with what you got if hank
aint the amazinest little ole guardeen
what ever come wrest why they aint
none

  not to be outdone in eulogy of his
employer pete rose to the occasion
nobly considering the lateness of the
hour at which he had retired he sure
is the cream off the milk of human
kindness and the fella what says lie
aint gits busted wide open

  lets go and rub down them hosses
afore hank gits a look at em said
ruddy

casualties by conversation

general tasker h bliss who after reaching the age of retirement
received the unusual compliment of being again named chief of staff
of the united states army was explaining that the casualties in the
present war are not so high as people believe he pointed to the estimates
of the various allies of the united states that only from three to five per cent
of their men engaged in battle are killed

    it reminded him he said of the confederate veteran who was paying his
first visit to arlington one of the burying grounds of the union soldiers

    so all the yanks are buried here communed the confederate looking at
the ranks of white tombstones humph we did a powerful lot of shooting
and i thought we killed two or three million of them somebodys been lying

                  by william h hamby

author of money and mollusks  room at the bottom  etc

                   synopsis of part one
allen dawson a young engineer known for his fearlessness in tackling- hard
tasks has just resigned from an undertaking in new mexico when he is engaged by
the continental sugar company to help survey the zapata swamps in southern
cuba his fiancee lola simmons has come with her mother to santa fe hoping
that he will aid in making the visit pleasant and she is much disappointed when he
announces that he must leave a fellow engineer burt williams accompanies him
on the steamer from new orleans dawson meets snor casada and his sister alicia
in whose family it afterward develops rests the title to the zapata swamps
although a spanish studeht whom he engages to carry the chain for him tells
dawson that the continental company is planning a railway for the region the
other engineers on the ground seem discouraged dawson hears that instructions
have been given by george halderman a boyhood acquaintance and now general
manager of the company to the effect that he is to have the hardest part of the
swamps to survey after a perilous trip through a crocodile-infested morass dawson
is discharged by the chief engineer hardy but later engaged again by halderman
williams afterward tells dawson that he has overheard halderman say to hardy
tha dawson must be discharged at the least possible excuse

                         a two-pert story-part two

ix

for three miles next day allen and
his two cubans had to pull and
push and even carry the boat

      the water got so shallow there
were spots of dry ground this ridge
if a rise of four feet in the land can
be called a ridge ran practically clear
across the swamp north and south cut-
ting it almost in two the smaller or
east part where allen had been survey-
ing and the very much larger west end
into which the river carried a vast
amount of water

  dawson paddled in a circle around
this part of the swamp camping where-
ever they found a spot of solid ground
at the edge and when they could not
they swung hammocks between trees
over the water as they did when sur-
veying he stopped to visit with each
of the surveyors-three besides wil-
liams jubilee bob looked like a moun-
tain preacher whose congregation had
all gone to a dance but he was plug-
ging away and was hardys favorite

  allen then crossed to the extreme

southwest corner of the swamp he
had made a complete circle and got a
rough sketch of the whole thing here
the swamp merged into the sea this
was the outlet of the river

  i have it now said allen with the
grim delight of finishing a job satisfac-
torily pull away boys-for some
place to camp

  it was late in the afternoon and no
possible place within several miles

  they turned east dawson thought
after a few miles they would find the
ledge between the sea and swamp above
the water in some spots but they did
not at sundown they were seemingly
in the midst of limitless swamp-slimy
water three to four feet deep-clogged
here and there with growths that made
progress so difficult they all had to get
out and push the boat through one
of the most troublesome of these swamp
growths was a sharp-bladed coarse
grass that cut their hands and faces
as they fought their way through it

  it was dusk with only a dim light
of the stars on the brackish water the


the popvlicr magazine

cat-tails looked like a black army in the
dimness and distant groups of swamp
trees stood out a mere dark splotch
on the water

  they turned the boat toward the
trees possibly they could camp there
if they could cook some food and
stretch their hammocks protected from
the mosquitoes by pabbelons they could
rest and sleep to sleep in the open
boat was impossible

  the two cubans were paddling and 
allen took the oars all were tired but
they threw an extra spurt of strength
into the effort to reach a camping place

  the boat struck something so sud-
denly luis at the front was toppled
into the water and ignacio and allen
thrown to the bottom of the boat

  even before allen scrambled up he
felt water in the bottom

  the boat was badly snagged he be-
gan scrabbling the stuff from the front
end and called to ignacio to bring him
some cloth-shirt sack anything
there was six inches of water in the
boat before he found the hole-a gap
in the bottom as large as his fist

  they were trying desperately but
vainly to plug the leak when their ef-
forts were cut short by luis who en-
couraged by an alligator took a too
sudden notion to get back into the boat
the water was up to their armpits
the bottom was mud allen stood
there perfectly dumb looking at the
stars for several minutes

  it was probably seven miles to the
nearest land a twenty-four hours
journey under favorable conditions
they had eaten nothing since noon and
were tired from a long days rowing
that they might be attacked by herds
of crocodiles was possible that they
wrould be followed and harassed by
them was certain

  well he said taking a deep breath
there is only one thing to do-get out

  he chose a direction fixed it with a
star took one of the oars and told
the cubans to find something to fight
the alligators with then they set out

  at times the swamp became shal-
lower once they sat down in the black
water and rested an hour at places

they had to make wide detours to avoid
the knife grass hundreds of cat-tails
or the hellish tangles of mangrove
roots

  about midnight when they were al-
most hopelessly exhausted allen saw
land ahead there was no mistaking
it grass and shrubs were plainly visi-
ble onlyr a little way off

  come on boys he called yon-
der is land-a place where we can rest

  it seemed queer that the water grew
deeper instead of shallower as he ap-
proached and it was nearly four feet
deep at the very edge

  he sprang up out of the wrater onto
the land it began to break under his
feet and he ran to get to solid ground
but the faster he ran the more he
broke through he got down on his
all fours and crawled-the land rising
and falling as though in an earthquake
-and occasionally his hand broke
through to water below

  then he began to realize that it was
not land but tembladero-floating
land made of leaves and deposits that
had accumulated enough soil to allow
grass and shrubs to grow several
times he got onto his feet but it began
to break under him and he threw him-
self flat to keep from going through
he had gone a hundred yards before
he had made this discovery he called
to his cubans to keep off and started
on all fours back

  once again he tried standing up
the bushes and grass around him were
waist-high the ground gave under his
feet he leaped and went through into
four feet of water already almost
delirious with the strain of the day and
night the horror of it-the hideousness
of being submerged in this slimy false
earth-in the midst of this weird hell-
ish swamp clutched him engulfed him
he fought like one being smothered
and clambered wildly to get back on
the surface but the earth broke under
his hand and he felt his legs and body
encircled by the hideous roots and muck
in that black water beneath

  he shouted desperately for help but
the cubans could not help they could
senoritas and swamps



not even get to him had they tried and
they were too scared to try

  it took him an hour to get back to
the open water

  ignacio he said when he could
speak you and luis go on i will have
to go very slowly-and may not get
out he had fought this swamp he
had hated it but somehow now he felt
lost sinking as though it had him

  no senor said ignacio i go as
you do luis he may do as he damn
please

  luis more from fear than loyalty
perhaps stayed also and the three stag-
gered on all night resting when they
could a few minutes striking with the
paddles when the heads of crocodiles
appeared above the black water mos-
quitoes stung afresh the blisters already
on their faces and necks stung even
through their hair night a wide
weird swamp loathsome things in the
water around them-and miles and
miles more of struggle

  one of the surveying party picked
them up at ten oclock next morning
and got them to the shore in their boat

  allen slept all the afternoon and
night in utter exhaustion the next
morning he set out by land for his own
camp

x

  one of the theories of the idealist
is that mind and body caper on the
green simultaneously that a laughing
dancing muscle makes a laughing danc-
ing spirit and a joyful mind makes an
exuberant body that a strong active
physique makes a strong active pro-
found thinking capacity

  but it does not-not once in a few
hundred thousand times anyway the
greatest mental adventurer is a fellow
who eats corned beef and cabbage and
hoes in the garden while the greatest
physical adventurer even in the mo-
ment of taking his life in his hand is
likely to be thinking about corned beef
and cabbage the most sprightly toe
dancer usually has a mind about as
nimble as a sea cow while the soul of
a darner of socks may dance all over
the clouds

  in the three days after his return
to camp allen dawson felt in every
muscle a great lassitude he scarcely
stirred from his mosquito-protected
hammock he was not sick merely
tired to the very marrow of his bones
but in that time his mind went on a
regular orgy his brain staged fights
long marches riots fireworks color
passion music beauty-and stillness

  without pencil or paper he figured
out the entire problem of the zapata
swamps made complete plans of the
work and closely estimated the cost
he divided it only that east of the
ridge could be drained profitably but
his plan would drain that and put it
into ideal condition for cane growing
for less than twenty dollars an acre
there would be nearly two hundred
thousand acres of cane land worth
from fifty to one hundred dollars an
acre that meant at least five million
dollars clear from the project

  why report 

  the plan was his discovery none
of the other engineers would report
favorably it would be his personal re-
port to george halderman that would
make that money for the continental

  the thought made him clutch the net-
ting of his hammock and hold it tight
after the continental abandoned the
project he could then quietly get some
capitalist interested organize a com-
pany and reap the benefits of his own
hardships and his own discovery

  next morning he told the cubans
to get ready to break camp that they
were going to conchita this was glad
news and they went at the work in a
trot there was drink and dance and
senoritas at conchita the swamp was
over there would be money now and
fiestas

  allen selected a high open place for
the camp that night it could not be
too high and dry to suit him the open
plain was dotted with scattering palms
and covered with brown grass a fresh
cool wind came from off the mountains

  at the edge of a group of palms a
half mile to the south allen saw an
automobile and a tent and a smoke
arising from a supper fire


the tpocpuljcr magazine

 i wonder who is camping over
there  he said to the cubans but he
was too tired to go over instead al-
most immediately after supper he
spread a blanket on the grass threw a
light cover over him and stretched out
on his back looking up at the stars
and had begun to doze when a slow
soft voice awoke him

  senor-it was ignacio-wish to
know who in the camp yonder et es
senor casada and his seester

  sehor casada and senorita alicia
allen rose on his elbows is that so
what are they doing out here 

  ignacio shrugged i do not know
senor his duty done he went to
bed as the rest had by dropping down
on the grass near the cart

  allen slept-and then awoke he
sat up straight and listened some-
thing had awakened him he looked
around but saw nothing stirring there
was no moon but the stars made trees
and shapes visible he thought of his
friend casada and senorita alicia and
looked away toward their camp he
could dimly see the white tent at the
edge of the palms and he saw some-
thing else-something moving between
him and the camp some figure like a
mans

  allen jumped up and walked over
to where his cubans were asleep

  vega was missing

  allen remembered vegas outbreak
when the automobile passed on their
way down to the swamp it was ca-
sada and his sister that vega blamed
some way about his land and since his
return half crazed by the hurt of his
shattered arm he had been more vio-
lent than ever

  dawson got his gun and without
taking time to put on his shoes started
icross the plain in a swift run

  he had covered half the distance
when he again saw the skulking form
of vega emerge froii behind some palm
trees about a hundred yards ahead
evidently he had not heard his pur-
suer

  dawson slowed up and followed the
cuban more cautiously but vega was
getting dangerously near the camp

  allen quickened into a run the
cuban heard him looked around
ducked low and dashed for the tent

  allen fired-not to kill vega was
half crazy-but the shot did not stop
him he took swift direct aim and
fired again

  the first shot had aroused young
casada the two men were grappling
allen could not fire again

  there was a scream the sister
dashed out of the tent but allen had
come up and seized vegas one arm
the two men overcame him and tied
him

  are you hurt allen turned to
young casada

  not much i think senor replied
casada stepping back and putting his
right hand up to his left shoulder

  oh et ees sehor dawson who has
saved us im so veery glad you
are not hurt alicia had run to her
brothers side

  no dear he answered

  oh im so glad she cried then
glancing down noticed her night dress
and gave a little shamed exclamation
she ran back into the tent

  young casada staggered and fell
allen bent over him opened his shirt
at the throat and turned it back in
search of the knife wound he was
hurt

  oh a quick sharp breath at his
side ees he hurt  the senorita
had hastily thrown on a wrap come
out of the tent and was kneeling beside
dawson

  im afraid he is replied allen
bring some water and a cloth and
make a light

  alicia obeyed with swiftness allen
had found the wound-a stab in the
left shoulder it was bleeding pro-
fusely he bathed it bound a hard
knot between it and the heart and then
made another pack of cloth and tied
that close over the wound

  the young man had fainted and the
sister was crying in fierce agony

 oh ees he dead  oh ees my
brother-dead 

  no senorita  no he laid his hand
on her arm to steady her he has
senoritas ant swamps



only fainted allen carried the slen-
der young man to his blankets he
will be all right directly

  oh im so glad so glad senor
dawson you are so veery good
she was completely reassured

  i will go to the camp and get help
suggested dawson

  oh not senor  the girl clutched
his arm i so-so scared alone

  but ignacio and luis aroused by the
shooting approached discreetly with
stick and machete

  allen called and they came in he
turned vega over to them and told
them to get the cart and start with him
at once to conchita vega was not
hurt

  i will take senor casada in the ma-
chine to a doctor

  when they had disappeared in the
dark allen turned to the girl standing
beside him he saw her shiver and
knew she was still at a great tension
she was standing close her head was
just on a level with his shoulder her
dark hair was loose and a strand of
il blew against his ncck

  do not be afraid senorita he
laid his hand on her arm reassuringly
see your brother is coming to now
oh senor she said in soft inten-
sity you are so brave-and so veery
kind what would poor little me have
done if had not you been here we
left our mother at conchita we were
to make camp and go back for her but
we got lost and it got dark and we
had to camp you sure my brother is
not going to be veery hurt

  i am very sure he stooped and
examined the shoulder the bleeding
has stopped he will be all right di-
rectly-and we will start

  how veery veery luckee-is tliat
the word sehor she laughed in
nervous relief luckee that you camp
so near she was standing so close
her round soft shoulder touched him
almost nestled under his arm and lift-
ing her face toward the stars he could
see the perfect outline of the clear del-
icate features and the black hair pushed
back from a smooth forehead pos-
siblee she said softly it was not-not

wrhat you call hem-luck may bee it
was something up there senor

  i hope it was allen spoke rever-
ently he had never felt quite so rev-
erent before nor quite so human

  ramon stirred regained conscious-
ness

  i will help you into the car allen
said assisting casada to rise i am
going to drive you to conchita

  thanks senor said casada it
was indeed lucky you came when you
did he was very violent he imag-
ines that our father took land from
him but he did not

  allen improvised a bed of the back
seat of the automobile for casada

  now you are comfortable

  veery senor thanks he was
weak but in no pain

  you will ride in front senorita
allen assisted her into the car

  you are so veery wise and kind
senorita alicia said as the car started
forward cautiously toward the road
you think of everything i feel so
safe

  dawson had known a good deal of
life but little of it was gratitude and
expressed gratitude he had known
scarcely at all and there is a differ-
ence between gratitude and expressed
gratitude honor and salary and vic-
tory make a mans spirit rebound give
him a feeling of purposefulness but
somehow nothing so satisfies his heart
and makes his blood run warm with
the gladness of life as to hear a wor-
shipful soft voice say you do every-
thing so well you are right always
senor

  that feeling of being right for some-
body a feeling that he did not have to
think about it to plan to work to
scheme to risk-but that already he
was right in somebodys eyes regard-
less-gave allen a feeling he had never
known and did not recognize

xi

  the conchita physician had pro-
nounced ramon casadas wound insig-
nificant  he might safely proceed with
his mother and sister and a hired chauf-
feur to their home in camagueyr


the popular magazine

  allen stood watching the machine
down the dusty road with a nameless
sense of loss and depression but a
little white hand slipped from the side
of the car and for a moment a hand-
kerchief fluttered and he turned away
smiling toward the correo he would
read his mail and write some letters
while waiting for his cubans to come
up with the cart

  there was a registered letter with
currency in full payment of his time
and his assistants to the day on which
hardy had discharged him there was
also a letter from halderman

  dear dare-devil  report to me person-
ally not in writing at camaguey as soon as
you are through i have ordered hardy to
pay you and your gang up to the time you
had the trouble with him i will personally
pay you and one assistant which is all you
will need until you finish your scouting ob-
servations as ever	g h

  one assistant well ill be-

that means allen said savagely that
the five others ive kept for three weeks
get nothing he tore the letter into
four pieces and threw them into the
gutter isnt that like george halder-
man 

  he dug into an inner pocket for his
travelers checks and counted the
leaves-one hundred and ninety dollars
-every cent he had left from his six-
teen years of risky jobs

  it would answer he managed to
get them cashed and when his cubans
came paid all six of them in full and
caught the evening train his ticket
left him nine dollars

  it was evening when he entered the
camaguey hotel a bell boy that spoke
a little english took his bag and led
him down a long corridor flagged with
brick-the same brick that had paved
the old spanish fort from which the
hotel was made-and let him into a
deep cool chamber on the ground floor
it had a lofty ceiling and a window
eight by twelve feet opened upon a gar-
den-a three-acre garden of magic

  tired as he was allen put out the
light and went to the window the
moonlight was on the trees and vines
and flowers and the fresh clean breeze
that stirred among the luxuriant foli-

age and blossoms was saturated with
the mingled fragrance of coffee blos-
soms of magnolia of violets of pun-
gent pines

  after a cool shower bath dawson
threw open - wide the shutters and
stretched out in bed propping himself
up with two pillows so he could see
the moonlight on the garden on the
soft fragrant night air was the faint
tinkle of a guitar and the voice of a
lover serenading his senorita

  i wish thought allen drowsily i
could stay here a century or two

  next morning he learned that senor
halderman had gone with some amer-
icans to marti and would not be back
for two or three days

  im glad of it said allen and in-
stead of going out to explore the town
he went into the coolness of the garden
and dropped into the easiest seat he
could find

 what a contrast to the swamp
what a place to rest and somehow
he never before had so wanted to be

still 

  if lola were here she would like
this there was poetry and romance
here this garden stirred little tender
emotions that had never come to light
before no wonder senorita alicia
had soft eyes and a musical voice and
a gracious movement of slim -white
hands living in this land of rest and
dreams

  why he arose with an immedi-
ate inspiration they are home ill
go call on her brother and although
he did not confess it he hoped her
brother would not be at home

  allen got into one of those low easy-
riding coches gave the driver the ad-
dress and let him do the rest

  the home of the casadas was one
of the twenty others in the block all
run together with the doors opening
directly back from the sidewalk it
was an old building and the heavy
knocker looked as though it had
pounded for many generations

  a cuban maid opened the door it
was a simple room-very little furni-
ture but he noticed the floors were
marble and the finishing of choice
sbnoritas and swamps



wood back through an open door he
saw a patio with flowers blooming

  senorita alicia came at once hold-
ing out her hand in a sort of glad shy
way

  et ees very nice you should call on
poor little me

  she wore a simple linen house dress
her arms and neck covered

  it is delightful that i have the
chance to call upon you senorita he
said

  she looked very charming in her
flutter of excitement at the unexpected
visit

  how is your brother allen asked

  better he go a little while ago
to meet senor coleman he and mees-
ter simmons on business

  coleman simmons echoed al-
len

  yas-are you acquaint with them

  i know mr simmons quite well
dawson wondered what theywere do-
ing in camaguey

  allen felt a distinct sense of pique
as the mother entered and took a chair
near the daughter he had heard that
spanish girls never visit with a man
unless the mother or aunt or an ac-
credited chaperon is with her but
never before had he realized how effete
and distasteful such a custom was

  im veery sorry said senorita ali-
cia apologetically but my mother can-
not understand one word of english

  he looked at her straightly wander-
ing if that was regret or an assurance
her eyes did not meet his she was
looking at a fan in her hand and her
long lashes dropped innocently

  it is too bad said allen with a
slight quizzical twist to his mouth
will you tell her i said it is fine
weather we are having

  the senoritas lips quivered around a
mischievous smile a second and then
she soberly interpreted to her mother
and the mother smiled and nodded gra-
ciously at the young man

  allen was curious to know more of
the life and the customs of the cubans
especially of the senoritas

  how do you amuse yourselves  he
asked

  alicia lifted her arched brows and
shrugged--a sober and reproving shrug

  oh senor we do not live-for-
what you call hem-fun

  the statement struck allen as a dis-
tinct reproof he had thought girls
always lived for fun of some sort

  how do you spend your time  do
you play outdoor games-tennis say 
n-o alicia touched her cheek
with her fan a very fair cheek that
meant nearly pure andalusian blood
no i do not go out much-the sun
he ees very treacherous with a young
lady

  he laughed well what do you do
to pass the time allen was really
curious

  i go to dances sometimes i veery
much like to dance but mostly i read
and think

  and what do you read

  i read the russian and the french
no-vels and the german philosophies
and my own poets-and the english
too

  jerusalem you do allen was as-
tonished and he showed it

  she smiled and puckered her brows
a little reprovingly again

  we are not all ignorance senor
we go to school in paris and new
york

  i should say you are not and
what do you think about he asked
naively

  she smiled at that bent her head
until she looked out shyly from under
her long lashes

  about beauty

  you mean yourselves

  no-q you-bad man she pouted

about happiness and- her face

grew suddenly wistful almost tragic
in its still yearning i think veery
much about some perfection-some
beauty that always seems just a little
farther off than i can reach

  he looked at her very soberly she
was a slender almost frail girl but
with latent fire in every movement and
under the lightest glance

  i have often heard he remarked
quizzically that spanish people have
quick fierce tempers have you


the popular magazine

  she laughed merrily this time oh
sometimes i get mad but not often
i try to control myself i think peoples
can it ees like a cat that came into
my patio a veery weecked cat that
wanted to eat the leetle birds but i
teach hem-and train hem until he a
veery good tat and will not tear up the
leetlest bird

  i never heard of that being done
before you must be a wonderful
trainer would you train a husband
like that  he asked banteringly

  oh-me-- she blushed over-
whelmed at the imputation i could
not presume to train a husband i
would expect hem to train me

  allen cleared his throat what
would lola think of that doctrine 

  i cant tell you how delightful it is
to have had this visit he said when
he arose to go

  it was also to me a pleasure she
said with a little heightened color as
she halfway met his eyes we never
get done thanking you for keeping that
weecked man from kill my brother

  i want to come again he still
held her hand

  i will be veery glad to see you
meester dawson and he knew she
meant it

  he went out and followed the nar-
row little sidewalk two feet wide
which extended along the front of the
house the street was just wide
enough for two vehicles to edge by
on the other side another narrow strip
of walk and another solid row of
houses a door a big window with shut-
ters closed and then another door and
window marking another house here
and there he caught an eye peering
between the lattice occasionally a
woman stirred by the germ of femi-
nism advanced to the bold right of
having her window open and looking
out on the world unscreened

  allen at a narrow turn heard a
scream-a rather shrill scream it
sounded-followed by a feminine
laugh

  isnt this town awful just look
at that street

  the rambling coche held two amer-
ican girls and- one of them was lola

  and without knowing why allen
stepped quickly into a narrow alley
out of sight

xii

  allen was in a shadowy corner of
the garden waiting for lola he had
telephoned her soon after luncheon to
announce his presence she was quite
surprised in a staccato way and was
awfully sorry but she was dressing
to go for an automobile trip shed
meet him in the garden after dinner
say at eight how was he anyway

  in spite of the garden and the night
allen felt the old uneasy questioning
the sense of failure and depression
which had oppressed him in the
swamps it had been intensified that
afternoon by a forwarded telegram
from a mining company in colorado
offering him a cold wet slippery job
of engineering at an altitude of thir-
teen thousand and some odd feet at a
hundred and fifty a month and he
would have to accept it there was noth-
ing else to do yet that was not solv-
ing his problems even if he dared
marry qn a hundred and fifty a month
lola would never live at cripple creek

  allen drew in a slow tired breath
he wished he could live in cuba and
have a house in a garden like this
where the wind was always balmy and
laden with fragrance and one need
never hurry unless he wanted to

  his mind slipped back to questions
that had been puzzling him why had
halderman ordered him discharged and
then reemployed him secretly  he
had been trying to figure that out ever
since burt williams had told him of
the overheard conversation w hy was
coleman here  he recalled lolas
quick comment on his greatness in new
mexico and wondered if her presence
had anything to do with it but the
smooth suave simmons was not on a
pleasure trip he was usually found
only where the promoters secret pick-
ings were good

  allen smiled as he recalled the
senoritas ncd swamps



quaintness of senorita alicia and her
manifest pleasure at his visit

  hello allen  he jumped it was
lola standing before him you are
good at hiding ive hunted for you
everywhere even her jocularity
could carry a sense of blame

  i thought this would be-just
right he said

  isnt it lovely lola reached up
and broke a sprig of the vine that
pulled at her hair and threw it down
but arent these cubans awful they
are too funny for anything i didnt
suppose there were any people in the
world as ignorant and behind the times
as they are lolas laugh was not
really so shrill as it sounded in that
still garden

  well how have you been getting
along she inquired abruptly

  oh rather swimmingly allen
grinned i must tell you about losing
our boat we had been wading all
day waist-deep-

  did you lose your boat

  yes got it snagged

  wasnt that too bad one time
when elmer sanders and i were out
rowing the boat ran onto a snag and
i thought to my sou we would drown
but mauds cousin came along and
picked us up

  allen did not go on with his story
but directly when the conversation
lagged told about vegas attack on
casada and his sister

  i wouldnt have got much excited
over that observed lola two cu-
bans less would not unbalance the
world

  allen tried to excuse that remark
she did not mean it

  casabas lola repeated directly as
though remembering what did you
say the names of those people were

  casadas

  thats it lola nodded positively
i thought id heard the name before
they are the people ive got to call
on im so glad you know them im
going in the morning and ill take you
along

  allen shrank from the mere thought
and started to make excuse

  not a word said lola emphati-
cally you simply have to go

  but not in the morning he pro-
tested morning is not the time for
formal calls

 lola threw up her head and
laughed

  as though it would make any dif-
ference to people like that

  directly she put her hand to her
mouth and yawned

  guess ill go to bed ill meet you
at nine and well go see your swamp
friends

  swamp friends allen straight-
ened up suddenly

  yes lola replied indifferently
didnt you know that young fellow
and his sister own the zapata swamps 
and allen was so astonished over this
unexpected information that he kept
his seat and let lola go in alone

  and ramon and alicia owned the
swamps  that explained many things
-ramons visit to new orleans his
and alicias trips over the plains-
casadas interest in coleman and sim-
mons but what did simmons have
to do with it

  next morning when dawson started
to meet lola to take her to see senorita
alicia he was in a miserable frame of
mind

 good morning allen stopped
with a start he had walked down
the corridor and turned into the gar-
den in such deep vexation he had not
noticed a plump pink-faced man in a
rocking-chair beside the walk it was
coleman leaning back comfortably
having a good after-breakfast smoke in
the cool of the morning

  how do you do dawson merely
nodded

  first rate somebody had been
flattering coleman he could not
otherwise have been in so good a hu-
mor

  when did you get in 

  two or three days ago

  coleman took the cigar from his
mouth and leisurely tasted the smoke
from the last draw they have good
cigars in cuba he puffed out his lips
meditatively so the mustache bristled


the popular magazine

he squinted his eyes in abstract shrewd-
ness

  you remember began the presi-
dent of the continental i spoke to
you in new mexico about our mana-
ger mr halderman told you the dif-
ference between him and a fellow like
you in that he thinks you merely
work got a good example of it right
here for several years weve held an
option on this swamp youve been sur-
veying been paying five thousand a
year for the option we decided this
was the time to either buy or quit
instead of leaving it to one or two
men he sent down a complete corps
of engineers but that was not enough
he went out to the swamp and saw
for himself thats the sort of man
gets to the top-a man we can depend
on

  as a consequence weve discovered
there is nothing in the zapata swamp
project we are throwing up our op-
tion and will turn our attention to other
cane land you see bob--i forget
your name-it is the man who thinks
and the man who goes to the bottom
of things who is invaluable to the big
employer

  then take your own case you did
your work very well oh-er-let me
see-- the lips went out in strong
disapproval arent you the one
hardy had to discharge the fellow
wdio shirked because he didnt want to
wade into the water oh yes you
are i remember now you are daw-
son and they told me in new mexico
you never backed out of any hard job
shows how little you can depend on
recommendations

  now as i was saying if you had
made good stuck to your task shown
any sign of unusual intelligence you
would have found yourself permanently
on our pay roll at a handsome salary

  mr coleman allen interrupted
it doesnt require an agile mind nor
an investigating habit to be president
of a big corporation does it  maybe
there is hope for me yet dawson
passed on leaving the mustache bris-
tling aggressively a frown between the

eyes and a deeper pink on the smooth
plump countenance

  and they had already thrown up the
project-had not waited even to hear
his report nothing the insolently su-
perior and patronizing haldermam had
ever done stung him like being thus
brushed aside as though all his work
and hardship and investigations were
not even worth hearing

xiii

  as they stood on the narrow walk
in front of the casada house and allen
swung the old-fashioned knocker his
heart seemed pounding harder than
the noise made on the wooden door
nothing he had ever done in his effort
to be agreeable to lola was as hard as
this

  the senorita received them gra-
ciously  allen had got word to her that
they were coming she wore a cool
modest summer dress that was as fine
as it was simple but there were
touches of deep color in it and gold
and silver filigree on her fan that
added a note of coquetry her soft
black hair was arranged entrancingly
she looked like the spirit of romance
of chaste intrigue yet with all so sim-
ple and sincere and friendly

  lola took the offered chair and sur-
veyed the room as an auctioneer might
do there was not much furniture
and it was old and sedate it was plain
lola set the casadas down in the class
of our working people at home

 you speak some english she
turned from the furniture to senorita
alicia

  a leetle bit the senorita lifted
her brows and do you speak-some
spanish 

  gracious no replied lola em-
phatically im glad i dont it is
hard enough listening to it she
laughed at herself for this

  allen attempted to draw the conver-
sation into neutral channels but it was
not a success

  i dont see how you people can stand
to live as you do remarked lola
they say you girls are never allowed
out alone
senoritas and swamps



  senorita alicia sighed and dropped
her lashes what were in the eyes bent
on her fan allen could only guess

  we do not need to go out alone
mees-simmons why should we go
alone 

  oh for anything said lola id
as soon be in jail as to feel i always
had to have somebody tagging along to
swear i wasnt wicked when i got
back she laughed a little jarringly
and a tinge crept into senorita alicias
cheeks

  it is our custom she said softly
maybe it is not so good as in america
but poor little me cannot change it

  it is being bossed by your men that
gets rrie remarked lola why here
a woman does exactly as her husband
tells her

  if one loves her husband mees
simmons-just the faintest flicker and
lift of the long dark lashes and the
tiniest peep at dawson-if one loved
him veery much he would be always
right

  hump lola dissented not on
your life they are never right until
they are put right she laughed
again

  do you ever have any fun she
continued

 oh yas we have amusements
sometimes we go to dances and to
fiestas and-we have callers

  allens eyes went quickly from seno-
rita alicia to lola but if the thrust
was meant it missed its mark lolas
mind was already on a scarf over the
arm of a chair she got up and went
to examine it

  that is a real spanish scarf i sup-
pose 

  yes

  what would you take for it she
was rubbing the texture between thumb
and fingers

  i would not want to sell eet
alicia answered slowly but-an-
other glance at allen-ill give it to
meester dawsons friend

  as they rode away allen was silent

  they havent much manners have
they  said lola

  dawson made some irrelevant re-
mark

  well im glad its over i hope
dad will let me have a little peace now

  peace  allen looked at her with
a dawrning surprise

  yes hes been pestering the life out
of me to get acquainted with the casa-
das thought if i made friends with
them it would make it easier for him

  allen forgot all about lunch as he
walked his room fitting into a solution
the parts of the puzzle he had acciden-
tally discovered

  it was clear now why halderman
had sent for him in the first place had
discharged and then secretly put him
to work again dawson understood the
whole plot

  no halderman had not changed he
was still as always working people
double-crossing them when need be
the leaping prices of good cane land
had centered his greed on the rich za-
pata swamps he had planned as gen-
eral manager to get an adverse report
for coleman and the directors of the
continental and recommend they drop
the option but at the same time to
get from dawson a thoroughly compe-
tent private opinion and if the swamp
could be drained then through the wily
simmons he would buy it on his own
account thereby making from allens
discoveries five or ten million dollars
for himself

  yes it was a great scheme only he
had not counted on the platitudinous
coleman and the blunt careless-spoken
daughter of simmons giving away his
decision prematurely

  again dawson faced the question
why report to halderman at all  he
was betraying his own employers why
should he expect loyalty from him
did the treatment allen had received
call for any fine-spun sense of loyalty 
if he kept his discovery in time-a
year or two-he might be worth a mil-
lion or five million dollars why
throw it away 

  allen went out of the hotel walked
through the garden and passed into a
coconut grove beyond his head was
bent and he walked fiercely he no-


the popular magazine

ticed the ground was strewn with with-
ered coconuts and dead fronds he
passed through the grove twice turned
abruptly and returned to the hotel

  has senor halderman returned
he asked the clerk

  yes he is just now in his room-
number thirty-four

  hello dawson halderman sat
by the window in a smoking jacket an
easy curl of smoke floating over his
head have a seat finished your
job

  yes

  what did you find  halderman
was still looking out through the win-
dow

  that the swamp can be drained and
drained at a reasonably small cost he
got up and walked to the window and
back talking as he walked his hands
were clenched but halderman did not
see that

  it is this way he said fiercely as
though to get it over with in a hurry
there is a ledge-a rocky formation
between part of the swamp and the
sea the swamp slopes to this ledge
and the water is almost five feet deep
there the lower part of the ledge is
hard rock above or about on a level of
the swamp is a stratum of softer ma-
terial the waves have cut this in
several places so there is a shallow
channel running through at high tide
water flows into the swamp and keeps
the swamp on a level with the sea

  now here is my idea cut through
that ledge at a number of places a little
deeper than the bed of the swamp
close these channels with locks at
low tide lift them and let the swamp
drain into the sea as the tide begins
to rise close them so the sea water
cannot run back into the swamp it
is simple but it will work and it will
not be very expensive

  he stopped walking dropped into a
chair and looked at halderman he
felt tired-unutterably wearv

  thats all

  whcn-halderman turned his face all
traces of excitement were masked

  im glad to have your idea dawson

i wanted to get an independent opinion
that is why i hired you on my own
account after you and hardy had that
come-to that and a feeling i owed it
to you after getting you down here
im sorry to say however neither
hardy nor any of his engineers agree
with you have you anything more
convincing any drawings or
sketches 

  no said allen you asked for
a verbal report

  very well halderman reached
for his pen and check book i believe
i owe you for three weeks work-you
and one assistant

  five assistants six counting vega
who was hurt while working for the
company

 haldermans eyebrows went up
oh but i did not authorize any such
a company you needed only one if
you employed more men than that it is
your affair

  very well

  allen took the check for one hundred
and ninety dollars folded it carelessly
and stuffed it in his vest pocket and
left the room without a word

  allen was in his room standing by
the big window looking out on the
garden as the moon came up and
touched the opposite wall

  two people were passing along the
path hidden by the luxuriant foliage
one of them spoke a little disgustedly
i cant see why-it was coleman
-you need to be running around with
that discharged surveyor so much

  it has been on papas account the
propitiatory voice was lolas papa
wanted me to be nice to him for some
reason but ill give him to understand
to-night that i do not care for him
around any more

  you better allen imagined the
puffed-out lips and bristly mustache in
the dark and grinned

  grinned-on hearing his betrothed
announce her intentions of sending him
about his business that she might marry
an elderly millionaire what was the
matter with him

  nevertheless when the telephone
senoritas and swamps

 

rang thirty minutes later he answered
it almost gayly

  yes this is dawson

  can i see you in the parlor upstairs
right away  it was lola-

  im coming he hung up the re-
ceiver and started

  well he sat down on the end
of a lounge and leaned back comforta-
bly he would let her do it

  allen she puckered her forehead
with intense thought and twisted the
corners of her mouth into deep suffer-
ing ive been thinking

  you dont look overworked he re-
plied lightly

  i-i there was a catch in her
voice wonder if we have made a
mistake

  a million of them he nodded
agreeably odd but he was feeling
happier than he had for months

  do you think we will be happy to-
gether  she asked in deep concern

  are we  he asked

  why-she attempted to pout-
when you are nice to me im-

  yes he waited in silence

  she fidgeted in her chair she locked
and unlocked her hands she cried a
little she was awfully sorry to hurt
him but really she ventured it would
be better for both to break the engage-
ment

  very well good-by allen arose
lightly and held out his hand she was
chagrined shocked angry it is very
hard on a girl for you not to be hurt
when she wants you to be

  allen found himself walking a nar-
row street between low one-story adobe
buildings humming a rollicking moun-
tain tune the wind was soft as a
caress and the moon threw a slivery
glamour over the old city lights
showed behind closed shutters senores
and sehoritas chatted in open doorways
while the mammas knitted or sat with
hands in lap behind them

  a guitar and the song of a serenader
came from down a side street

  allen felt buoyant so happy he for-
got to be ashamed of it there was
romance and rest and life in the world
again

  he turned to the south toward the
plaza he would wrarn young casada
and his sister of haldermans and sim-
mons scheme

  the brother and sister were in the
front room sitting in deep dejection
but as allen entered young casada
sprang up and welcomed him enthusi-
astically 

  why my good friend that saved
my life im so happy to see

  allen noticed that senorita alicia was
very polite to him punctiliously polite
-and distant this quite delighted him
nothing could have pleased him more
but the brother not understanding the
cause was puzzled and glanced from
time to time questioningly at his sister

  you remember senor the young
spaniard got up and walked the floor
shrugging his shoulders and shaking
his head in the deepest despondency
when i met you on ship i was veery
veery happy-i thought-id done
great things for-all of us

  but he threw out his hands palms
up despairingly it is all over instead
of being very rich we are veery veery
poor it was the swamp he went on
unburdening his trouble they were
to pay us two hundred and fifty thou-
sand pesos i thought it was all settled
they now will not even pay us the five
thousand upon which we live these four
years it ees veery bad senor i do
not know what to do

  senor casada said allen that is
what i came to talk about he
glanced from the corner of his eyes
at alicia and saw her brows arch a
little more aloofly 

  the other engineers reported that
the swamp could not be drained but i
reported it could and it can look
here he spread out on the table a
sketch of his plan this part here
at the east about twenty-five by nine
miles can easily be drained into the
sea the new railroad would build to
it and through it it will be some of
the richest cane land in the world and
it will be worth from fifty to two hun-
dred dollars an acre

  now i have reason to believe they
have canceled this option in order that


the popular magazine

other parties may buy the land from
you cheap

  if an offer is made dont sell it
unless you get a good price if i had
the money i would give you five hun-
dred thousand dollars for it to-night
and take all the risks if you can keep
from selling it at all it will be better
if you could organize a company and
drain it yourself it would make you
several million dollars

  casada was intensely excited his
despondency vanished with one shrug
of his shoulders

  oh senor what hvonderful news
we despair we were veery poor-now
senor tells us we will be rich he
threw his arm about allen and hugged
him senor always bring good tid-
ings

  senorita alicia had also caught the
spirit of the good news and her face
was radiant but meeting allens eyes
she remembered and grew instantly
aloof again

  dont be too hopeful advised al-
len i may be wrong they may not
offer to buy

  but we ourselves will drain it said
casada undampened

  it will take money reminded al-
len much money at least a hundred
thousand dollars to begin

  but we havent any money at all
the young poet collapsed in his chair
suddenly despondent again where
are we to get a hundred thousand dol-
lars 

  i dont know answered dawson
you could get it from me in a minute
if i had it but i have only a hundred
and seven

  senorita alicia smiled at this in spite
of herself

  senor dawson she said eet is
veery hard to live with a poet some-
times it is all the flowers that grow
and then it is snow and there are no
flowers anywhere

  allen arose and held qut his hand
to casada

  well dont sell cheap whatever you
do

  i will not his hopes climbed once
more ill make them pay

  he offered his hand to alicia she
took it formally her eyes down her
brows up

 how soon does senor dawson
leave 

  senor dawson replied allen
holding the hand in a firm warm grip
does not leave he is going to stay
in cuba and may he come some day
to see senorita alicia again

  with instant melting coquetry the
brows went down the long lashes lifted
ever so slowly until the brown eys
looked up slantingly and twinkled as
they looked

  will senor be-alone

  he will

  just a fleeting moment of pressure
and her hand withdrew her lids flut-
tered down the color came to her
cheeks

  oh i shall be glad for senor daw-
son to come-veery soon he is so
wonderful a man-and so kind

xiv

  at eleven oclock allen still walked
the camaguey gardens the moon-
light fell on three long walls that in-
closed it a brief breath of wind shook
the huge vine that clambered over the
balcony of a second-story window and
its thousand gorgeous blossoms added
their perfume to the incense-laden air
somewhere in the night was a stringed
orchestra and the sound of dancing and
in a minor key somewhere else in the
night a guitar begged eyes to sleep not
until they had looked out of the lattice
upon one who was dying for the love
of the beautiful senorita

  on this night it did not sound foolish
to allen he understood now there
zuas romance in the world for in his
palm still tingled that last quick pres-
sure of a little soft hand and in his
ears sounded the slow music of 

  ill be glad for senor to come veery
soon

  yes senorita alicia would ever be
glad to see him coming and would not
find fault when he came she would
not make him feel he wras always blun-
dering always failing if a woman
senritjs and swamps



loved her husband-veery much-he
would be always right he smiled at
that how quaint she was-and how
wise  one could do many many things
for alicia because it would make her
happy

  dawson was buoyant next morning
he was out early breakfasted at seven
the night the thought of senorita still
lingered in his mind but as a pleasing
background for his fighting plans

  he had decided to fight for his idea
fight for what his brain and persistency
and hardship had rightfully won for
him he had thought it out- during
the night

 halderman and simmons would
move slowly they would not so much
as take him into consideration much
less fear him they would hold off
until casada was very anxious to re-
alize something for the swamp then
they would make a small offer proba-
bly twenty thousand dollars not until
they began to discover casada had
knowledge of the actual value o his
possessions would they begin to bid up
but once they discovered there was op-
position they would move swiftly- and
fight recklessly to get that swamp

  well they should not have it all their
own way with a hundred and seven
dollars-allen laughed to himself-one
might do wonders

  lie did not know anybody else around
camaguey that was at all hopeful he
put in the day trying to think of some
remote relative or friend of a friend
that might risk ten thousand dollars on
his word

  late in the afternoon he picked up a
copy of the havana post of the day
before tn running over the arrivals-
most of the news was about the com-
ing and going of americans-his eyes
struck on one item

  richard fleming of the southern sugar
millmachiiier company arrived from new
orleans to-day mr flemings company
have extensive interests in cuba and he will
be on the island a week or ten days

  two hours later dawson was on his
way to havana second class

  fleming had gone to guanajay and
he did not get to see him for two days

    i i ij 

but allen put in the time learning all
he could about him and the southern
mill company they were primarily
manufacturers of sugar-mill machinery
but had immense capital and often
backed sugar companies in order to get
contracts for building mills more-
over for years they had been enemies
of the continental sugar company

  this was most hopeful for the
swamp when planted to cane would
require from four to eight sugar mills
costing about a million apiece that
would be a lot of business for flem-
ings company allen remarked a chart
of the swamp indicating where mills
should be erected

  fleming was back at the hotel thurs-
day and allen got an interview with
him he was a well-fed courteous
southerner with a reckoning eye al-
len saw at once he would be very polite
and probably offer to buy the drinks
when he refused to buy swamps but it
would take clear solid facts to make a
jolt in his financial calculations

  after an hour-an hour of harder
work than dawson had ever done
jumping thousand-foot precipices-
fleming leisurely leaned over to the
table and picked up a case of cigars
offered allen one and took one him-
self

  as he smoked wrinkles gathered
around his eyes and his lids half
closed he studied for about five min-
utes talking all the time in a lazy
friendly way about havana and the
spanish dancing and the view of the
harbor

  then all at once he uncrossed his
legs and turned squarely on allen
about you-ah swamp-how much
money are you putting into it 

  i think allen replied soberly dig-
ging into liis pocket it is now about
forty-two dollars

  fleming laughed good-naturedly
but i have the idea and the skill
ill put the work through and i am
willing for the man who puts up the
money to have fifty-one per cent of
the stock

  some of those drainage projects
dont work out in mud as easy as they
-

the cpocpulacr magazine

do on papeh but-ill let you have
ten thousand dollars with which to con-
vince me that we ought to put two
hundred thousand more into your com-
pany

  they talked on details

  i will get an option from casada
for a year for five thousand dollars
of the money proposed dawson
yes that is the first thing and
he gave dawson five hundred for pre-
liminary expenses

  i appreciate this a lot mr flem-
ing allens heart was beating so hard
as his hand closed on the check that
he could scarcely keep his voice even
especially trusting me with money
when you know nothing about me 
oh smiled fleming broadly i
may know moah about you than you
suspect you did some work for us
once but you didnt know it

where was it  allen was curious
never mind boy he said smiling
broadly run along now and sew up
that option  then report back about sat-
urday

  what a beautiful city is havana
with its soft whites and browns and
corals its clear sky and tropical foli-
age and the blue laughing sea around
it ah what a wonderful country is
cuba what a chance for a man to
learn the joy of real living and to be-
come rich 

  these were only fragments of the
many thoughts and emotions that swept
through allens mind as the train crept
back toward camaguey

  he hurried directly to the hotel to
leave his grip as soon as he washed
the cinders out of his eyes and off his
face and hands he would hurry to
casadas without taking time for din-
ner

  the ever-alert tip-hoping cuban boy
had his grip and was leading the way
down the corridor when allen saw a
man with a tight white vest a cigar
at a cocky angle standing at the bar
to the left

 it was simmons who had been
drinking health to himself and sim-
mons saw him and came out to greet
him

  well he was smiling triumphantly
you thought you had fixed us but it
didnt wfork son it never does when
you run up against your uncle hilarys
power of persuasion in an hour i had
those casadas seeing your claws and
teeth and they signed up with tears
of gratitude

  signed up  allen put his arm
against the wall

 you bet i bought the zapata
swamp from them-three hours ago

xv

  senorita alicia herself opened the
door why meester dawson how
veery glad i am to see you

  neither her tone nor handclasp indi-
cated a belief that allen had claws and
carnivorous teeth for a moment daw-
son had a flickering hope that simmons
had lied-that he had not bought the
swamp

  my brothar will be also so glad to
see you she said after they wrere
seated he has some veery good
news her tone and eyes fairly bub-
bled with happiness but i will not
steal hees pleasure he wants to tell
eet hemself about selling the swamp

  allen swallowed hard to smother a
groan that wtanted to get loose it was
true then  oh well he began to rally
evidently senorita alicia did not de-
spise him anyway

  the senorita does not wear a ring
he was surprised to hear himself say-
ing as he looked at her soft white
hands

  she dropped her lashes and blushed
a little

  oh no senor poor little me never
wore-what you call hem -the en-
gagement ring

  allen suddenly knew how it felt to
hear really good news

  senorita alicia he began ear-
nestly  her lashes fluttered she looked
at him a second and then down yet
once more she lifted her eyes with a
sort of breathless waiting i have no
money no job-now but when i suc-
ceed im going to tell you something
-tell you that you are the most de-
senoitas and swamps



licious the most precious girl in all the
islands and continents of the earth
oh senor she blushed her breath
coming fast you-are making jest
you are what you say-joking

   i never was so in earnest dear i
must not say it now but im going to
do something-make a lot of money
down here-and then im coming really
to say it to you

   oh senor she was pale with ex-
citement now but her eyes met his quite
steadily in their great earnestness
moneys do not count for anything-
at all-when one-when one-her
lashes dropped-one cares

   senorita allens voice was hardly
controlled and then a step on the
walk the door flung open and young
casada the poet his eyes blazing his
hair disheveled rushed in

  ah senor how fortunate i
wanted to see you most of all he
seized both of dawsons hands ive
news great news ive sold the za-
pata swamp to meester simmons

   i am very glad for you said allen
trying to hide his chagrin and swal-
lowed his own loss bravely did vou
do well 

   yes-it is all settled the check-
eet is good-and we are rich

   that is great for you declared al-
len enthusiastically how much did
you get 

   at first they offer twenty thousand
he laughed i snap my fingers at
them they come up and up and

up- he began near the floor with

his hand and showed writh each suc-
cessive gesture how the price rose to-
ward the ceiling at last i get two
hundred and eighty thousand dollars 
two hundred and eighty thousand
allen exclaimed well you are a good
t trader

  yes the young spaniard fairly
danced i could got much more but
i would not let them have the part
you want-the part twenty-five miles
of the east

   allen as excited as the young span-
iard leaped forward and grabbed him

by both shoulders you did not sell
that part i surveyed 

  the cuban shook his head no
senor did not you say you want to
organize-company and drain that i
kept that back and now we have money
to do it with we will put in two hun-
dred thousand in your company-wont
we bonita alicia 

  allen looked at her and she nodded
assuredly then he sank into a chair
collapsed into a heap and broke into
a wild laugh

  my friend he said when he could
speak that is the richest thing i ever
heard-the finest thing the gods of jest
ever let this old world pull off

  the part of that swamp you sold
to simmons and halderman is worth-
less  it can never be drained and you
got money enough from them to drain
ours make us millionaires oh boy
but you are a jewel-you are a poet-
you are-a daisy 

  i must go put this check in the safe
of senor roberts said the young man
taking up his hat

  when he was gone allen and seno-
rita alicia left standing turned facing
each other her hands shook a little
with excitement her face was very
white she breathed in little catches
she spoke a few words in spanish to
her mother then glancing up at
allen from under her lashes explained
motnar will make us some cool
drink for another minute they stood
facing each other two steps apart
senor allen she said it very slowly
and softly es-ees it the custom as
i have been told in america fipr peo-
ples-that are engaged-to-to kees be-
fore they are married

  he gave one swift glance over his
shoulder to sec the mother was out of
sight in the kitchen-and then two
quick steps

  this-and this-and this is the
american custom he said in snatches

  and very shyly and softly from his
shoulder  i think-american cus-
toms-are veery nice

a yarn from the focsle of the naval transport dixie in which a
real honest-to-goodness scrapper is up against an opponent who
refuses to be licked although he has no chance in the world to win

the naval transport dixie was
rolling in the long heavy swell
of the western ocean-three
days out from the rock as sea-
faring men call gibraltar-with a fair
breeze on the starboard bow the
first division of the ships company and
some of the marines of the guard were
scattered over the focsle in little
groups some of them sitting on the
hatches and others lying on their cork-
ing mats all smoking their evening
smokes and talking it would not be
long until the first watch was called-
it was now six bells-when some would
go below and turn into their hammocks
while those of the watch would take
their stations for four hours duty

  yes sirree ive seen some dang
queer things in the service while i was
collectin all these here hash marks
spoke spud murphy referring to his
enlistment stripes on his arm the
bunch of homeward-bounders squared
themselves around the better to hear
him spud murphy had served on the
trenton in samoan waters and had
been with dewey at manila in short
he was now homeward bound to be
retired after almost thirty years con-
tinuous service his position aboard
the dixie was chief boatswtains mate
and captain of the foretop

  after a few puffs at his pipe he
said the best one-the one im goin
to tell yuh about-was the case of a
fighter and he was a fighter too a
real honest-to-goodness scrapper well
ill tell yuh he was such a brute in
his fightin that the ships crew called
him the bruiser

  it happened aboard the paragua-
one of the mosquito fleet-at the be-
ginnin of the philippine uprisin that
we got this here gent he come in a
draft from the buffalo at the time she
made her maiden trip to the islands
there was four or five of em in the
bunch that was to relieve the over-
timers

  i remember that trip spoke up a
gunners mate i was on the charles-
ton then that was a few weeks before
she went down

   s that so  returned spud

  yes i had the eight-inch starboard
battery aboard her

  why i kin remember it as well as
if it was yesterday continued murphy
we was layin off iloilo at the time
the buffalo hove in sight the typhoon
season was then-it was blowin a reg-
ular gale and the seas was runnin
mile-high through them straits

  we made our number from the sig-
nal yard but she never so much as
dropped her mudhook-just come in
and lowered one of her vhaleboats an
sent em over bag hammock an ditty-
boxes you know the kind just a
bunch of third-baked men-o-wars men

  when they got their luggage stowed
forard an was a-standin aroun on
deck i hears this bloke made a crack
i waited till he comes again with it
i was standin by the wench when he
spouted it

   this sure is some madhouse
some madhouse says he

  now you all know that aint no
way fer to come aboard a ship that we
fellers called a home its true she
the bruiser



wasnt any size as compared with the
kentucky or kearsarge she only had
a few hundred tons but what she
lacked in tonnage she sure made up in
hard service

  do yuh know i could hardly keep
from usin a belayin pin on that guys
head i took a good look at im an
then i told him right out that if he
was as good a man as the ship was a
ship an went where she went without
wishin that hed never shipped in the
navy id be damn bad mistaken

  is that so he answered i want
a real ship-a battleship for mine cull
see  and then he struts down onto the
berth deck with a sea roll to his walk
thatd make a deep-water man feel like
a dock hand i followed down the lad-
der an bein as i was second class
then an the senior petty officer aboard
i give im his billet-we didnt have
any station numbers-an told him hed
pull an oar in the first cutter when-
ever she was called away i wanted
him in my boat sos to keep my weather
eye on him he just smiled a toleratin
grin of hisn an said all right bo 

  shake a leg with that yarn spud
broke in the gunners mate ive got
to report the battery to the chief its
sixbells past now

  christmas was cornin on an all
of the army and navy officers chipped
in money to make up some purses for
holiday sports-the same as they most
always do us fellers bein tied up
with the army in campaignin moved
into the dock which was just up the
river a short ways an we was invited
to join in an take part too we all
gets busy an ribbed up this larson-
that was his name-to go against a fel-
ler named rielly of battery a field
artillery we told him how we ex-
pected him to make a name for us an
the ship an that got im well from
tha on about all we heard round the
decks was ring an prize-fight talk he
even brought out his scrapbook an
showed us write-ups from new york
papers on some of his fights then he
told us how he got to be the boy cap-
tain of the main top on account of his
bein able to wallop them kids about

  two or three youngsters-ordinary
seamen they were-looked far out to
sea and thought of their days spent at
the training station and aboard training
ship xhey too thought of some big
husky youngster who acted under the
captain of the part of the ship and who
lorded it over them

  well sir murphy went on when
christmas did come aroun an the
bluejackets from the yorktown which
had come in port for the holidays
sports had got ashore-not to say a
thing about all them soldiers in iloilo
-there was some mob at the cockpit
the cockpits where the fights all took
place--dogfights cockfights an man
fights-an on christmas night there
was four bouts to be pulled off

  a regular madison square garden
show commented the gunners mate

  yessir it was a regular mill that
was and lets see first there was a
doughboy and a flatfoot as the sol-
diers called us men-o-wars men
started the evenin off with a four-
round setto they was fast ones too
considerin they was nothin but a pair
uh kids that one i think they called
a draw

  then up comes a mule skinner an
a hospital-corps man who got busy an
swapped punches like sixty for three
rounds with the skinner gettin a shade
the best of the go an all durin this
bout feast we could see the bruiser
as we all was callin im by now gettin
as busy as yuh please secondin first
one an then another of the fighters

  just sorta turned to an made his-
self a hand spoke up johnson the
quartermaster knocking the ashes out
of his pipe and throwing them to lee-
ward

  exactly exactly replied spud
then comes the real thrill of the af-
fair for us fellers of the paragua
bruiser larson of the paragua an
sergeant rielly of battery a said the
announcer that was a semiwind-up
so the program which they sold for
filipino childrens aid said well
wre fellers of the navy all stood up an
cheered uh course didnt want them
soldiers to think we wasnt for our
the pocpulacr magazine

man the ships bell that was bein
used as a gong rang out the two boys
stepped to the center and wiggled
mitts and got the once over from the
crowd an they lamped each other too
they did look purty husky stripped to
the bare and then after a few words
from the officer who refereed they
went back to their corners time
yelled the officer an they walked to it
the bruiser was smilin an he sure
did act like as if he was right at home
an knowed his business there he just
crouched down low an kept a-goin into
riellys punches a-blockin an dodgin
an landin now and then whenever he
got a chanct course you know how
excited a bunch of enlisted men git
over a thing like a fight cornin off
sos there no use tellin yuh the officer
called it a draw

  but he hastened to continue
after that night it was sure hard to
live with the bruiser it sorta affected
him in heaps uh ways we wasnt doin
much right after that ceptin scrubbin
down decks an gettin aboard fresh
water whenever we needed but we
had the devils own time gettin laf-
son to bear a hand on any of the work
-he was most always uptown at the
cockpit or the keno joint-an it was
hard to stop him cause we had a free
gangway an no sech a thing as a lib-
erty list

  we had on board another young
feller that had bin with the ship since
she first went in commission he went
by the name of rogers-carl rogers-
an he come from out west someers
he was just one of them quiet kids
that always had a good word for all
hands an minded his own business he
was actin gunners mate at the time
an done his work well too the offi-
cers liked him the same as the rest
of his shipmates ceptin the bruiser
he had a pick at that boy from the first
day he comes over the gangway it
didnt seem to matter much with
rogers though he always used to
pass off the bruisers remarks good-
naturedly but as the ole sayin goes
there come a time when he didnt pass
the remark

  it was right after we had drawn
monthly money an of course some of
the gang went uptown to the canteen
an took on a few high ones among
em was the bruiser an he didnt stop
at gettin his hide full he brought a
dog aboard he had it stowed away
in his blouse well he comes over the
gangway an ducked forard sos the
ole man wouldnt see im an met the
kid rogers under the bridge-just
where the superstructure went up from
the spar deck take a drink simp  he
ups an ordered the boy no thanks
i never touch it answered rogers an
starts aft with his gun rags to clean
up his battery by so-an-so youll
drink with me an when i ast a man
to drink---well hed best drink thats
all so down with er  rogers tried
to wave him off an started to pull
loose from the bruiser who had him
by the jumper sleeve

  ill be dog-gone if i really know
what followed next it happened so
suddenlike the way it seems was
that the fighter jerked rogers nigh off
his feet an then made a pass at im
an hooked right under the jaw that
settled it he only made the one swipe
till that rogers kid was tryin hard to
work im over but of course the
bruiser was too much for im why
when hed hit the kid it seemed as if
hed mighty nigh break his head loose
from his neck i saw just how it was
goin to end an jumped in an stopped
it-dang nigh got a maulin mself fer
buttin in too rogers got a pair uh
shiners an a deep cut cross the right
cheek while the bruiser never got so
much as his hair mussed

   long bout supper time the fighter
comes up on deck hed been down be-
low sleepin it off or tryin to git rid
of his jag he looked aroun the deck
an saw the kid a-settin on the railin
then he went straight over to him
an the boy got down on deck but the
bruiser said lets shake n be friends
rogers not on yer tintype the kid
snapped back nuther thing i want
yuh to know ill never shake hands
with yuh cause i aint yer friend an
i wont pretend that i am just cause
the bruiser



yuh beat me up i also want yuh to
know yuh didnt whip me an never
will that stands jes where i put it
cause i dont knowt how to run the
big feller looked at im a second then
shook his head an walked away we
was all a-watchin fcim an if hed made
a move to a hit that boy i spect thered
bin a warm ole time right then and
there

  dont blame the boy a bit ap-
proved the old-timer not nary a
bit

  after that said murphy with a
shake of his head the feller rogers
never spoke to the bruiser at all-but
just sorta ignored im course we all
sided in with im an would a backed
im up in it till hell froze over

  well when the bad weather begin
to break the army got busy gettin
things in shape for the spring campaign
which was alwyays hard work yuh
never had to cooperate with soldiers
did yuh 

  nope answered the old-timer
 ceptin in cuba

  it sure aint any sunday-school pic-
nic  thats certain one day there
comes to the ship an officer from gen-
eral hughes headquarters-his aid i
guess he told the skipper that the
general presented his compliments an
wanted him to take a detachment to the
north coast that night an land em fore
the break uh day i wtas cleanin some
bright work on the gangway railin an
overheard him talkin about it he
said that it was a regular hotbed of
gugus in that place called capiz an
that the chances was thered be a warm
scrap on hand

  sure enough the detail of soldiers
-ninth infantry it was-them fellers
that later made such a record in china
-that come a-troopin aboard at six
bells when the whole blamed water
front was asleep ceptin them carga-
dores working for the q m an spyin
at the same time from the looks of
the bunch i reckon there must a bin
fifty men all told i know a pusson
couldnt walk forard without steppin
on a soldier a-layin sprawled out on
deck

  after we got the lines all cast off
an had floated down the river an out
into the straits the ole man-that was
lieutenant sterle a son of the admiral
-gives the engine full speed ahead an
a jingle we wasnt even lowed to
light a cigarette an jest had the bin-
nacle lamp to steer by he said for us
not to smoke till we was well offshore
no one much cared to smoke anyway
as they had bout all wanted to cork
off on deck fer the rest uh the night
while they had the chanct

  yuh sec and spud relighted his
pipe for his final smoke of the evening
and threw the cold match over the side
the run from banate to iloilo an
them other little towns takes right at
three hours er better so for us to git
to capiz it took all night steady steam-
in we got off the reef-had it on
our port bow--just as sooie the chink
cook was callin the crew to breakfast
the soldiers had to hustle an git their
bacon an coffee on the galley stove
sos to be ready to land when the order
was given

  the quartermaster had been sent
aloft to watch the reef an he saw it
too cause he hollered land ho  the
captain answers im where away
two point on the port bow the quar-
termaster-shouted back we all peered
out into a mistiness an sure enough
there it was it lay some distance from
the entrance to capiz river where
there was a loag beach of white sand
a mile er so long i reckon the skip-
per got his glass on that spot and then
hurriedlike he focused it closer
theres a bunch uh hombres back there
in that grove he says to the army offi-
cer an hands him the glass

   theres too many of em to be
fishermen er farmers says the army
man bracing the glass against a bridge
stanchion as the ship rolled in the
trough of a sea an took another squint
shoreward what dyuh think bout us
landin there captain  he asks lieu-
tenant sterle after a little

   now thats up to you i heard the
ole man say as he ordered the man
at the wheel to starboard his helm a
little more then he went over to the


the popular magazine

nunciator an jerked it back to half
speed ahead an called fer me to come
to the bridge as the engines eased down

  when i reached the bridge the
skipper an the army officer was both
inside the little chart house a-markin
off places an talkin bout the general
lay of the country i reported to im
when he looked up an he told me to
arm-an-away both cutters he said to
mount the six-millimeter automatic in
the bow of my boat then to see that
both crews carried belts full of ammu-
nition fer the lee straight pulls i
hustled em all together an got em
lined out to orders by this time har-
ris was in the chains a-takin soundins
with the lead as the ole tub pinted her
nose toward the beach

  i went amidships an takin far-
rell with me i got busy lowerin-just
easin off the boat falls-dropped em
down to the rail of the well deck sos
the soldiers could git in em easier
seemed to me like that shipd never git
close enough in to anchor-she just
creeped along-but we was out quite
away an then the skipper wasnt takin
many chances on them bum spanish
charts we was usin

  finally he shouted boats crews
stand by the rest uh the boys all
hustled aft to their boats an got in
em while they swung on the davits an
i reported we was all ready to lower
away the army officer split his men
into two bunches-one part of em to go
in my boat an the other to git in with
sewell i looked up at the ole man on
the bridge fer orders he understood
it wont anchor yet murphy he
calls down to me

  well we didnt come to anchor-
not right then anyway we waited
until we got back from shore where
we met a bunch uh peaceful-lookin
hombres all a-gatherin cocnuts but
somehow er other or from some clew
-i dont know jes which-the skipper
an the army officer decided to go up
the river there was a small tug-
itd hold bout twenty men i guess--
it a-layin at anchor in the little cove
they got it an got some men aboard
of our gang there was rogers far-

rell the bruiser an mself the
bruiser wasnt much good at anything
but he could steer a ship fairly well-
when some one watched out to see that
hed keep on his course-so i put im
at the wheel

  we started up the river which had
a lot of uncertain banks hidden neath
the water the channel if there was
one no one knewr it but we just
guessed at it by the bends an the strong
current of the muddy water the
banks on each side was just thick with
overhangin brush-that made a dandy
kind of a hang-out fer gugus-so there
we was travelin upstream an didnt
know much just where we was goin

  i guess wed been goin along fer
nearly a half hour er so an as there
wasnt anything excitin to it every one
had kinda settled down to takin things
easylike we didnt feel that there was
goin to be anything doin at all but
we was wrong-all wrong

  pow whiz-z-zip an ole muz-
zle-loadin cannon cut loose from out
there in the brush there sure was
some scatterment of nails lead an
stones the soldiers was a-gettin to
their guns an startin into work right
now we all unlimbered our lees an
cut loose with em but they kept on
a-shootin right back at us till i
dropped my rifle on deck an jumped
over an put the colts machine gun to
workin they couldnt stand that fire 
no sirree no human can stand ma-
chine-gun fire furs that goes but we
soon had em on the run then what
got our goats was the tug the blamed
thing was swingin plumb round an
fore some one could get to the wheel
she rammed her nose head on into the
bank an the engines a-goin kept
drivin her deeper the skipper called
for the bruiser thinkin he might have
quit the wheel in excitement to fire
at the gugus but that gent did not
answer then some one yelled  look 
we all craned our necks in the direc-
tion of downstream bout a hundred
yards below us with his hands a-splash-
in an clawin at the air was larson
a-callin fer help we also saw under-
the bruiser



neath the overhangin brush of the
river-tween us an the bruiser
a-swimmin with that long overhand
stroke of hisn-the kid tryin to git
there to save the bruiser

  it didnt take im long to reach im
in that swift-runnin stream an when
he did reach im he grabbed im by the
back of his jumper collar an slugged
im one in the butt of the ear drownin
people handle a heap easier when yuh
knock em out the way the kid did
with his pistol he had a hard swim
bringin im in but by grabbin hold on
some branches that swung out over the
river he hauled im ashore

  by the time i got the tug backed
out of that mud bank an lay her along-
side shore decentlike the kid had car-
ried him out on the grass an let im
flop larson was all in

  several of the men jumped ashore
an run down to where they was throw-

in out a guard line to keep the fili-
pinos from a-comin back at em

  when i got there he was a-coughin
rogers was givin him first aid for the
drownin at a signal from the bruiser
he stopped liftin him by his waist the
water was a-comin outa his lungs we
started to lend a hand but the bruiser
waved us back then he clawed at the
kids pants leg till he got it in his hands
there was tears in his eyes an he just
bawled out to the kid rogers says
he rogers wont you be my friend-
my shipmate i done yuh dirty kid
an im the one that knows it bettern
anybody i may be a fighter an a
bruiser but theres a devil of a differ-
ence in fights an fighters just cause
i beat yuh up an cause yuh couldnt
wthip me dont turn me down after
what youve just done i thought all
the time i saw yuh was yellow but it
was yellow gold i seen

by henry p downes
author of sleazy aid the malm arte   etc

   you must remember billy sleazy the little exjockey member of the
powerful malmarte organization of gilded crooks who put over a slick hocus
pocus on a greek hotel proprietor he comes to the fore again in a rural
operation that promises odds against him but sleazy deliberately under
takes the brick game because it is considered impossible it is a story
calculated to provoke mirth as well as more serious emotion

a novelette

with a map taken from the wall
of mcshaynes billiard room
spread out on a table before
him billy sleazy ex-jockey
and member of the malmarte recited
the doggerel bf hickory dickory dock
the mouse ran up the clock as with
closed eyes he rotated a pencil in the
air

  shoot  commanded bob greyson
his bosom pal and club fellow

  done cried sleazy dropping the
pencil to the map and opening his eyes
ah what have we here  the state

is vermont and the town- take

the night glass mr greyson and step-
ping to the rail state what you make
her out to be

  to judge from her riggins captain
a dutch merchantman outbound from
the zuyder zee-a well-found ship sir
of seventy tons burden laughed grey-
son but seriously billy all i see is
a period and some small very small
type lets see-ive got her now
f-a-i-r-fairlawn is the name she
must be a small burg but if she has
over three thousand population my bet
goes five thousand even you dont cop
what say you 

  it goes as it lies bob all set
now to get the specifications on this
here town how shall we-

  but we must retrogress a little an
hour before the ex-jockey and greyson
left the portals of the malmarte and
arm in arm sauntered down broadway
sleazy immaculately dressed always
was a diminutive fellow popular with
every one who acknowledged to some
forty years and who looked half his
age greyson tall and handsome a
fine figure of a man according to
vsleazy with a voice low and soft that
belied the inherent compelling force
of the man was one to be reckoned
when deeds of daring were on foot

  by force of habit talking and laugh-
ing they made their way toward mc-
shaynes before they wrere aware of
it they had entered the room the
hour was well before noon and save
for a porter or two cleaning up and a
billiard mechanic engaged in repairing
a table the place was deserted

  lighting cigarettes they seated them-
selves and watched the mechanic in
silence they were in truth ennuied
the malmarte had recently enriched its
exchequer to the extent of a million
and a half dollars of which sleazys
share was fifty thousand dollars and
greysons who was a charter member
of the organization probably a great
deal more they had sated themselves
with all that money could buy and now
the gift bearers



they craved for action once more
which with them confidence men by
nature and training could take only one
direction

  presently the billiard mechanic
looked up and with a smile of rec-
ognition nodded to sleazy the jockey
waved his hand easily in return and
after a few puffs on his cigarette
asked

  how is the old fellow who helped
you fix our tables at the malmarte 
the one i mean who was always tak-
ing snuff

  hes dead sir the mechanic re-
turned slowly he has been dead over
a month now its a funny thing about
him too he worked for our company
over twenty years and never spent a
cent foolishly he was taken with
pneumonia suddenlike and having no
family at all we took him to the hos-
pital he tried to tell me where his
money was then but he was too far
gone and when he died we had to
take up a collection to bury him seems
funny dont it him having all that
money 	

  then shaking his head from side to
side in a puzzled way the mechanic ar-
ranged his tools in his bag and de-
parted after he was gone sleazy re-
marked thoughtfully

  that was peculiar wasnt it bob
i suppose that fellows money is
hoarded away in some bank or other
and nobody will ever get any benefit
from it just think what a help it
wrould be to the man who has just left
if he had it he could retire from
work

  those things happen often billy
and sometimes more so observed
greyson reminiscently for instance 
years ago long before the malmarte
was organized i worked in the west
with silent carver the greatest brick
man the game has ever known silent
had a great distrust of banks naturally
enough and carried all his money on
his person and if his roll got below
fifteen or twenty thousand he thought
he was broke

  well one time we had a deal all
framed on a fellow in denver i had

done the preliminary work and the
brick was ready to be passed silent
the supposed miner who owned the
brick was to do the closing and it was
arranged to have the come-on meet
silent in a place we had picked out
i was in an adjoining room rigged up
in a policemans uniform with my eye
glued to a hole in the panel of the
door sometimes the come-ons yapped
for the police and we always tried to
have one handy

  this come-on was a cattleman
silent came into the room after a time
and started to work at once and a
mighty smooth workman he was at
length i saw the cattleman start and get
to his feet silent paused and the
two of them were looking each other
in the eye he was usually as pale
as a cadaver but now the color was
surging to his face finally the other
man said

   youre dave arent you you are
my brother dave you must be
there is the scar over your eye that
you got when we ran into the horse
trough on our sled when we were boys
oh dave and i was going to take
advantage of your necessities why
brother half of all ive got in the world
is yours you keep your gold and come
home with me 

  but silent wouldnt admit his iden-
tity he stalled around for time and
then saying he wasnt feeling well
made an appointment for the following
day after the man went he sat for
a long time turning something over in
his mind and then telling me that he
would see me later on he left the room
i didnt say anything to him about the
cattleman silent had a hard cold eye
that never blinked and though i knew
him as well as anybody did i didnt
really know much about him he was
one of that kind you can never get to
-polite and affable and all that billy
but it would never occur to you to
ask him any questions about himself
you knowt that kind

  that night he came in and tossed
the brick on the dresser he clasped
his hands behind his neck and cocked
his feet on a chair by and by he


the vocpuljicr magazine

came to some conclusion satisfactory
to himself for he smiled i always
remembered that smile he called for
drinks and toasted me saying heres
to success to-morrow greyson then
he threw himself on the bed

  i kept on smoking until i heard a
gasping noise in the room i glanced
toward silent there was a froth on
his lips and his whole frame was
writhing in agony the truth cattle to
me then

   im passing out greyson he said
dont bother to call any one and go
through with our deal to-morrow it
isnt right for you to be cheated out
of your share that was all he said
before the end came

  now i concluded that being his
partner his money should belong to me
so i searched through his pockets his
wallet was there-empty not a single
dollar billy he was clean  and i
knew for a positive fact that he had
over twenty thousand with him when
he left me that day i thought it all
over and came to the conclusion that
he must have sent it by mail probably
to his brothers home so i stored
away the brick and his guns and went
down to the office to report his pass-
ing

  the clerk when i came to the desk
handed me a sealed envelope it was
a statement in sileiits handwriting
telling what he intended to do-an out
for me you see in the event there
would be any trouble then his
brother came back unexpectedly i
dont want to talk about the rest
after the way he took on i couldnt
possibly do anything more with the
brick if i got a million dollars for it
and the more so as i saw that silents
brother had come to have an inkling
as to the real state of affairs so i
did what i could and moved on

  greyson threw away the dead butt
of his cigarette and lit another pres-
ently the jockey with the air of dis-
missing unpleasant thoughts remarked
tentatively

  the brick stuff has gone out of
fashion lately i wonder at that too
it was a big winner formerly and hu-

man nature doesnt change it was out
of my line of course but i knew some
people who did well at it

  silent turned over a hundred thou-
sand at it in two years billy but he
always would fall for the old faro bank
and that kept his balance down
greyson said slowly

  sleazy laughed

  the little white fish are being
spawned as frequently as oyore and
they will always respond to me same
bait do you know bob i recently
ran across a fellow shy his right food
hook who thinks he has devised a
system for beating the races and who
wants to bet the money he got from
the railroad company on it everything
in the world has a market except a
combination potato parer and cork-
screw

  why pick that out from the grab

the gift cbelcrecrs



  ill chance it like a woman picking
a winner at the races with a hatpin and
her score card get me down the map
off the wall yonder like a good fellow
and seeing willing walter the mixol-
ogist has arrived order me a drink
aye aye sir and ill stake you to
silents brick it is somewhere among
my effects at the malmarte heres
your map go to it

  how shall we go about that bob
an encyclopedia from the nearest
library should do there is a branch
on the next block

  they went to the library accordingly
and greyson thumbed down a reference
book to the letter f

  here we have it he declared and
told succinctly by the editor of the
clarion sometimes a lot can be done
with editors billy if they are prop-
erly approached take it from me
this one hasnt given the old town the
worst of it hm lets see-

  fairlawn town founded october  
orange county vermont for location see
map of vermont ref -c sixteen miles e
of screwdriver and nine miles n e of
belgo it has seven churches an incorpo-
rated school great water power and exten-
sive manufactures of milled and roofing
stone pop of township  
   estimated 

  notice billy how the learned edi-
tor has shot her to the front coming
down the stretch when the returns
come in from the next census the
clarion will have to do some tall back-
tracking you best steer clear of this
man he will be dangerous

  you think he rides them wide at
the turns bob queried the jockey

  offhand i should say so that es-
timated jump of his at the tail end dont
seem to me to come off the third rail
with the proper angle de oro i think
would play that shot with reverse eng-
lish no i dont think i wrould bother
with him

  consider that settled i wont any
other suggestions 

  well silent who never made a mis-
take on his approach used to say the
best brick consumer was he who at-
tained mans estate having the original

  nickel given him in boyhood for carry-
ing a valise superadded to the quarters
donated by his uncle on birthdays
there used to be a sucker list of those
when i was west but i havent seen
one of late years and that is why the
game must have gone bad

  leave that to me i am sure i can
dig up the proper man that is the
kind i angled for when i was advance
man for jimmy dars crew of foot-
racers that is the game that has gone
bad not the brick oh the money we
made and the times we had gold-
bricking  pshaw it is to laugh

  greyson laughed raucously and
threw up his arm as if fending off a
blow  as an attendant called a warning
sh-h he asserted

  your foot was over the line billy
on that last serve surely you do not
intend to compare bricking a game
in its niceties of skill and finesse with
the crude work that characterizes the
foot-racing field you may as well try
to compare a selling plater with a stake
horse-passbook with roseben why
that game of yours was so coarse you
could not get an artist to touch it it
was rough stuff-rude unpolished
work

  the jockey eying his companion
truculently a moment answered 

  it was eh let me tell you some-
thing you highbrows didnt touch it
because you didnt have the nerve if
you made the money we made youd
have to wear soup tureens for hats i
thank you greyson for that passbook-
roseben stuff old rose was a hoss all
right but look at his prices-even
money four to five or three to five
and passbook came down the line with
a hundred-to-one against him on the
stools that was real money-and he
won there you are 

  that was once in a lifetime rose-
ben was a consistent winner

  the jockey grinned

  how often would you want him to
win at that price  that was us when
we won with the speed boys we took
the whole town we carried three dif-
ferent speeders and went along a cir-
cuit like a circus why wte would be


the popular magazine

  in and out of a town while you brickers
were picking out the suit of clothes
you were going to wear

  well its every man to his trade i
suppose said greyson evenly how-
ever this game of yours looks so sim-
ple to me that i will give you the same
wager you made me a while back that
i can pull it off in this same burg you
are going to

  thats a bet and in exchange for
that brick ill get you a speed boy
chet mills one of our old crew has
a brother thats a marvel on the paths
the boy is a nice fellow too and will
stand without hitching we can see
chet about him now if you like
that suits me bill- do we take
this fellow with us

  no he should have a few days
start of us we will have to arrange
for his plant in the town

  the jockey informed greyson that
the mills brothers were both waiters in
borspns restaurant which he fre-
quented  they went thither and opened
negotiations with the elder mills for
his brothers services sleazy of
course did the talking and the conver-
sation took such a technical turn that
greyson was unsble to follow it the
terms of hiring were however ar-
ranged shortly to the apparent satisfac-
tion of the contracting parties

  it is all understood then said
sleazy at length frank starts for
fairlawn to-morrow

  how does he town himself billy
asked chet and does he work
straight or reverse

  how is he with the hooks chet
ive showed him all i know
then he better town himself as an
honest toiler coming in with a sob on
the rods after a bout with old j b
with fall spuds in the kick for the
ozone he goes to the town yell and
swards him if he can this should give
him an obit if the sobber is a dailv and
a file in the p n if a weekly grey-
son can turn him as he likes the corps
is passing the other way

  here you fellows get in town
exclaimed greyson let me in on this
too its my money talking for the

  speed boy lets hear what it has to
say

  we were saying bob laughed
sleazy that when frank gets to fair-
lawn he comes in as a mechanic who
has been on a bust he gets into a
row with a town officer and whips his
man if he can he will be arrested
of course and he will have sufficient
money left to pay his fine his arrest
will give him a paragraph in the police
news of the local paper if it happens
to be a daily and half a column if it
is a weekly

   chet was also asking whether you
intended to have frank win his race-
that is run straight-or to have him
do a fall and let the other man win
-and i told him that you could suit your-
self about this it is your funeral and
i have no interest in the matter one
way or the other

   thanks billy said greyson dryly
now tell me why the speed boy wishes
to get arrested in the first place and
the advantage or disadvantage of his
running straight or reverse

   sleazy laughed slyly

   let me see greyson he drawled
were vou going to sell that brick for
me or was i going to do it myself i
recall now you said a real artist would
eat up this foot-jracing stuff nothing to
it at all no finesse you remember
now i rise to a point of order if it

doesnt require finesse why-

   oh i can manage it all right billy
have no fear of that broke in greyson
hastily i was just curious about one
or two points thats all ill make out
o k i feel certain

  sleazy grinned and the mills
brothers laughed outright then chet
observed admiration in his voice
thats great mr greyson we
always thought jimmy dar was the best
in the business but he quit it in dis-
gust of course my brother clears
from under when he does his part
that must be understood he is to
assume  risk at all

  flow can that be mills asked
greyson if there is trouble how can
he duck it without me

   sleazy interrupted
the gift bejjers



  you have an out-and-out hiring ar-
rangement with frank bob no per-
centage proposition whatever he wins
or doesnt win as you direct as for
the post-mortem of how he can or cant
do something or othsr leave that to
him it is part of this crude game
you know and my what a lot of ques-
tions  there is no finesse-

  ha ha laughed greyson you
fellows are working the bogy man on
me im on to ou and ill show you
a few twists and quirks you never sus-
pected before

  say chet the jockey jerked out
does that ha-ha stuff sound natural
to you  it has a kind of funny curve
to me little reginald van dusen
laughs that way when he gets lost in
the park with a box of candy and spot
moriarity from avenue a sticks him
up

  come on billy said greyson
reaching for his hat lets get back
to the malmarte ill hunt up silents
brick for you and there are some prep-
arations i wish to make for myself
come on echoed the jockey sig-
nificantly where have i heard that
expression before  chet ill be around
to see you when i get back to town
i just know we are going to have a
long laugh together over something
frank you leave for fairlawn to-mor-
row so long

  at the malmarte greyson brought
the jockey to his room he hauled
out a steamer trunk from his closet
and getting down on one knee threw
out on the floor various articles of im-
pedimenta when he had worked to
the bottom he tossed out two guns one
in the regulation holster and the other
much smaller in a leather-pocket ar-
rangement with a triangular web on
the outside in which were fashioned
three strongly made buttonholes

  those were silents irons re-
marked greyson still exploring the
trunk

  the one in the holster is according
to hoyle bob but i dont make the
little fellow why the drop-stitch
stuff

  silent was a two-gun man ex-

plained greyson facing around the
big one he kept for show and the other
he worked with desoite what the
story writers sayit takes a long time
comparatively to swing a gun from the
rear silent didnt believe in lost mo-
tion so he carried the other suspended
by the band on the inside of his coat
he was left-handed and when he had
occasion to draw he bluffed with his
right toward his hip and pronto the
other was covering his man not that
he had to gun often either for as i
told you he was one of that kind no-
body cared to argue with

  it must have been amusing to see
him work said sleazy easily

  greyson swung around and sat
tailorlike on the floor with a frown
gathering on his face he eyed the
jockey a moment and then declared 

  i dont like your stance at the tee
on that stuff sleazy amusing you
said listen once in cheyenne we
cleaned up and there wasnt a bank
running in the town on account of some
shooting a few days before so silent
set into a poker game that was run-
ning in the hotel-an old-time he-one
it was with whiskers i didnt feel
lucky so i didnt play just sat around
to watch

  as it happened there was a little
ratlike fellow in the game who claimed
to be a drummer it turned out that
he had educated fingers but nobody
suspected that at first-except silent
finally there came along a thundering
big pot they were all out except this
fellow i mention and silent it came
to a show-down and silent threw three
kings on the board

   those are my best sir did you
buy a better hand  he said in a sort of
husky measured voice he traveled with

   three aces answered the fellow
i win

   no i win drawled silent i said
buy the one you took from that
attachment in your sleeve doesnt
count

  well billy the fellow went around
for his gun but silent had him covered
in a trice with the little one that
by the way was the first time i ever


the popular magazine

knew he carried two and believe me
or not the fellow went to his knees
with his hands stretched out in suppli-
cation  

   do you know- how to pray asked
silent quietly no one else in the room
so much as moved the fellow shook
his head from side to side with an ob-
vious effort he couldnt articulate i
imagine then silent said 

  ill teach you say after me
lord have mercy on my soul

   lord have mercy on my soul
quavered the poor fellow

  greyson made a significant gesture
with his hands and then as if to efface
unpleasant thoughts turned again to
the trunk sleazy gazed moodily ahead
of him for some time with his shoul-
ders twitching a little finally he ob-
served slowly

  ill take itback bob im glad
now i never saw him work but at that
i cant jibe the line he followed with
the way he acted it was peculiar
every man has a code of his own
and silent had his declared greyson
inasmuch as brick buyers he claimed
were effecting to get an advantage over
the seller they were equally culpable
i never gave much thought to the mat-
ter myself but there seems to be some
truth in his theory at any rate he
would no more cheat at cards than the
most moral man who walks the street
what he believed in he lived up to
except once bob you did your
part that time he attempted to rib his
brother where did your split come
in 

  pass that it was probably my
fault for not carrying through as he
directed at last here is silents
brick prettv dusty but still servicea-
ble

  sleazy weighed it in his hand

  gee it is heavy he exclaimed
id almost buy it for gold myself
how much is it supposed to be worth
when you are selling it

  around twenty thousand i should
say offhand of course there is some
real gold run into it at several places
where the come-on makes his tests

  how is that done bob

  greyson laughed mockingly

  who is going to sell this brick-you
or me he asked ill tell you what
ill do ill trade the desired informa-
tion with you for the reason the speed
boy gets arrested-even stephen no
sight unseen 

  done the speed boy cabooses him-
self so that everybody will know who
he is and how he came to town that
averts suspicion at once and a fellow
like that can always get a job where
another man couldnt it is an-honest-
fellow-down-on-his-luck thing and
thrashing the town cop makes him a
hero with the sporty crowd a lot of
birds are killed with one stone now
about testing the brick

  wait a moment billy all the test-
ing materials are in the trunk also here
they are in this metal-lined mahogany
box silent had ynade for the purpose
now you take this acid and place it
on the spots indicated on the brick
and-- hello  the markings have
become obliterated i shall have to
measure over the brick with a rule to
find them and it will take some little
time suppose wre let it go for the
present ill show you later on before
we start for fairlawn bricking is a
hard game these days that is why it
has fallen into disyse

  you fellows take it too seriously
im thinking you watch my smoke
when i get started vending the cube
i know just the way to put it over
ill surprise you bob

  greyson chortled derisively

  you will know the difference be-
tween a watchmaker and a blacksmith
after you have worked on that a
while he said

  i know that now thats where i
have the advantage over you adios
bob ill meet you at the buffet down-
stairs at seven-thirty a week from to-
day

  what do you intend to do in the
meantime 

  think i am going to do a whole
lot of thinking to protect that bet i
made you and i would advise you to do
the same

  at the appointed time the two
friends left the malmarte carrying
their grips and turning the corner
walked along the block in search of a
taxi when they had proceeded some
distance greyson hastily deposited his
bags on the sidewalk and retraced his
steps sleazy saw him remove a coin
from his pocket and drop it in the hat
of a blind beggar whose post was on
the corncr when he returned the
jockey said dryly

  what is that for bob-a bribe to
good fortune

  i couldnt really say billy i sus-
pect that fellow is an eye-throwing
faker but i can never get by him
they got their train and rode on
until late in the afternoon at a junc-
tion a few miles from their destination
they were compelled to wait for a train
connection there was a hotel across
from the station and sleazy taking
one of his bags went there wrhen
he rejoined his companion he was
clothed in a rough-ajad-ready suit with
a shirt of the butternut pattern and
minus a necktie in the upper outside
pocket of his coat a toothbrush and a
pocket comb showed prominently
greyson eyed him with amusement and
called out

  greetings hick

  you should cultivate your powers
of observation more greyson re-
turned the jockey angrily you didnt
lamp my nether members did you 
im a western man-miner

  turning his back on greyson the
jockey entered the smoking car of the
train greyson laughing heartily
mounted the steps of a coach when
the train arrived at fairlawn a few pas-
sengers got out the station platform
was crowded with townspeople loung-
ing about the hackman for the hotel
was standing by calling out this
was for the palatial

  greyson following the example of
one or two commercial men gave the
fellow his grips when the fiackman
however attempted to relieve the
jockey of his sleazy put them behind
his back

  b p

  arent you going to the hotel sir
the driver asked

  what are the rates the jockey
inquired hesitatingly

  you will get those at the office
no you dont i suppose if i de-
cide not to stay you will charge me for
the trip up i had that game pulled
on me once before-in the black hills
i guess ill walk up how far is it
half a mile  but there is  charge
mister you can ride if you like
thats what the fellow in the black
hills told me ill walk and take no
chances

  come on driver  called out one of
the drummers we cant wait all day
for one man and the driver with a
snort of disgust jumped into his seat
and the hack moved off

  after the wagon was gone a tall
hatchet-faced man with a cap having
express printed on it approached
sleazy easing himself against the wall
of the station he remarked

  i heard you say you were at the
black hills once my cousin was out
there a long time his name was tom
harney did you ever happen to run
across him

  sure i knew him returned sleazy
quickly him and me were bunkies
together why did you say was  
tom is gone the expressman said
sorrowfully he came home six
months ago and only lived a month
afterward some kind of fever the doc-
tor said it was

  sleazy seized and wrung the others
hand much affected

  tom is the very man i came all the
way across the country to see he mur-
mured didnt he ever mention me
at all  didnt he ever talk about his
old pal jack

  then you must be weston but i
never heard tom call you by your first
name he always said smoky 
thats it all the bunch always
called me smoky on account of me be-
ing so-

  i know quick on the draw tom
said do you know i kinda had the
idea you were a bigger man the way
tom described you


the vovuultr magazine

 that was old tom exclaimed
sleazy laughing if he liked you at
all you were always the biggest and
best in the business why we were
out on a jamboree together one time
and he wanted to bet i could snuff a
candle farther away than any man in
the place now there was a fellow
present who had the reputation of-did
tom tell you about that

  tonis cousin laughed reminiscently
they were now surrounded by a little
knot of men as sleazy broke off
he heard one behind him explaining to
another evidently a recent addition to
the group its a fellow from the
west come on to see tom harney
the expressman remarked

  no tom didnt tell me about the
affair you mention but he did describe
that fracas you had with the fire eater
in popack

  i remember that grinned the
jockey it was great while it lasted
but-

  hey harney the ticket agent
called out at this juncture miss
glover is on the phone and wants to
know if her trunk came she says she
is in a hurry for it

  i will have to be going said har-
ney get on weston and ill give
you a ride to the hotel

  after they had pulled away from the
station sleazy asked

  did tom mention our compact to
you mr harney 

  call me bill no i dont remember
that he did what was it about 
this said sleazy evenly opening
his bag and drawing out silents brick
half of this was to belong to tom-
and now he is gone its too bad 
suffering fishhooks cried har-
ney is it gold

  the same bill before i left the
black hills for alaska tom and me
made an agreement that after a cer-
tain time we would seek each other out
and divide all the money both of us
made in the meantime well i made
something over twenty thousand dol-
lars along the yukon came back to
frisco and had it smelted into this
brick afterward i went to the black

hills to find tom but they told me
he came on here so i followed him
the poor fellow

  im his only relative said bill so
quickly sleazy was compelled to smile

  i know that bill but i was trying
just now to puzzle out what tom would
do in like circumstances i was won-
dering if he would hunt up my old
mother and give her half of all he had
when he found that i was gone and
the jockey shook his head from side
to side doubtfully

  tom would give any one the shirt
from his back said harney mean-
ingly

  that is true enough i guess
sleazy observed slowly then twist-
ing around in his seat so as to face
his companion he observed

  tom was always a saving fellow
did he leave much when he died 
well no not much the doctors
bills and the funeral expenses were
high of course still he had--
and not a single word of our agree-
ment broke in sleazy sorrowfully
i cant understand that of tom
he was raving a lot before the end
harney explained now i remember
he was trying to tell me something
but i couldnt make out what it was
seems to me that must be it there is
the palatial now but no friend of
toms is going to stop in a hotel while
bill harney has a roof over his head
you come along with me to meet the
wife

  i couldnt do that bill i want to
think over something ill go to the
palatial if you dont mind

  then ill go in and introduce you
harney declared jumping down from
his seat here george he called to
a bystander get up and deliver that
trunk to miss glover and when you
come back run the rig under my shed
as george drove away sleazy in-
quired of bill

  is it customary in these parts to
need an introduction to hotels  all we
need in the west is money

  they will treat you better if they
know you are a friend of mine har-
ney remarked insinuatingly taking up
the gift bearers



the grips my sister-in-law is the
cook here and she bakes great pies
ill tell her to send you in something
extra

  dont bother to do that said
sleazy shortly i dont want to be
under obligations to you until i make
up my mind about the gold and
taking the bags from the others re-
luctant hands he hurried into the
lobby of the palatial bill after ex-
plaining to some friend that the new-
comer was a friend of toms whom he
had been corresponding with for some
time followed the jockey up the steps

  sleazy deposited his bags on the
counter he opened one of them and
carefully removed the gold brick strip-
ping from it its canvas cover close
by was greyson complacently smoking
a fat cigar with his chair tilted against
the wall scattered around were sev-
eral more guests of the hotel some
engaged in conversation and others
writing letters the clerk with a pen
stuck above his ear whirled the reg-
ister around toward sleazy his eye
extended its widest was on the brick

  before i register declared the
jockey impressively i want to know if
your safe is safe this is a brick of
gold i have here and it is worth twenty
thousand dollars and when i do regis-
ter i want a receipt for it

  attracted by a gasping noise behind
him he turned to see greyson his face
suffused with blood making ineffectual
efforts to get his chair to the floor and
trying with nervous fingers to un-
loosen his collar

  hello  exclaimed sleazy the al-
titude here has got this fellow i reckon
somebody had better get him out into
the ozone before he chokes

  a drink panted greyson

  one of the drummers rushed toward
the water cooler

  i reckon that fellow dont mean
water when he calls for a drink
drawled the jockey motioning the
water bearer away here harney
he gdded take this slug and fetch him
a drink from the bar

  the expressman departed and reap-

peared shortly with a glass of whisky
which greyson drained at a gulp

   thanks he breathed as he rolled
an accusing eye in sleazys direction

   the bartender says he will send you
 the change later for that thing you
 gave me weston harney laughed

 tell him to never mind bill di-
rected sleazy ill be in to barter most
of it with him in a few minutes

  he took the writing pen from the
clerk and paused for a moment with
an interrogative lift of his eyebrows

  you get your receipt said the
clerk and your gold will be as safe
in the palatial as in the mint

  thats where it came from-
frisco the jockey answered as he in-
scribed jack weston on the book in
a scrawly hand

  you neglected to put down your
home address mr weston the clerk
mentioned revolving the book again

   i havent any if this place proves
 out as good as it looks i reckon ill
 call fairlawn home 

   mr weston is an old friend of my
cousin toms interjected harney
he came here on business with tom
not knowing that he was dead it
seemed to sleazy the expressman threw
a little emphasis on the business
seeing that he will probably remain
here joe you had better put him on a
home rate

   ill do that gladly bill the clerk
 remarked then after placing the
 brick in the safe and returning the re-
 ceipt to sleazy he smiled and asserted
 i thought that was a regular gold
 brick at first mr weston

   thats what it is the jockey af-
 firmed with a show of surprise

  i didnt mean the same thing you
mean i had reference to a bunko
brick

   ho ho sleazy laughed thats
pretty good i see what you had in
mind now this is the first time that
occurred to me i reckon bunko bricks
are not trotted around in this manner
i guess you are right a commercial
man at the cigar case laughed

   what do you say stranger asked
sleazy turning to greyson


the popular magazine

  not that i ever heard of returned
greyson and only the jockey detected
the biting sarcasm in his voice

  well boys the putative weston
drawled there is a chunk of that same
stuff waiting to be liquefied at the bar
lets go and bill you had better
rustle those  fellows in off the stoop
too i dont come to fairlawn often
and this is my birthday lets all be
merry

  the jockeys motion seemed to be
carried unanimously as they moved
to the bar sleazy bringing up the rear
observed a man coming down the steps
that led from the second floor to the
lobby as it happened their eyes met
and such was the compelling light that
emanated from the other the jockey
stopped in his tracks as if arrested by
something physical the man seeing
this smiled understandingly and pro-
ceeded on sleazy seized harneys
arm and pointed after him

   who might tha be bill  he asked

  thats jeff orms harney said
he owns the hotel here the bank and
a whole lot of other things and what
he dont own outright he has a mort-
gage on he came to fairlawn broke
from nobody knows where a dozen
years ago and started in the palatial
as a clerk now he is rich nobody
around here could ever get the best
of him in a dicker jeff is a smart
man

  he looks it said sleazy entering
the bar

  the hotel man walked across the
lobby and was going out the door when
the clerk called to him oh mr
orms come here a moment please

  what is the matter now joe  he
laughed returning are you a dime
over in your cash again 

  no mr orms but i want to tell
you something and the clerk in-
formed him in detail of the supposed
westons appearance with the gold
brick when he had finished the hotel
 man asked him if the cube was real
gold the clerk stated that he person-
ally believed that it was but suggested
that mr orms see for himself the

proprietor laughed at this and inquired
if eph bliss had reported yet

  he is out on the porch now ill
call him in joe grinned he will
know all about it of course

  whats wanted jeff bliss in-
quired coming up to the desk

  who is this weston eph the
hotel man asked

  bliss went  to give an account of
sleazys appearance in fairlawn he
informed orms that bill harney and
weston had been writing to each other
about some money that the latter owed
tom harney before he died and that
weston had come on to make a settle-
ment they said that weston and
bill were arguing about the amount
coming up from the station in bills
wagon and that now as long as tom
was dead wreston wasnt going to give
bill any part of the amount owed him

  hm grunted orms when bliss
finished his recital if i am any
judge bill will make him talk turkey
before he gets out of fairlawn with
that gold

  then you think that is real gold
weston has in the safe asked joe

  without doubt the hotel man an-
swered the bunko fellows are al-
ways pussyfooting around the out-
skirts we are going to see some fun
when weston refuses to give up toms
share to bill plarney

  bliss inquired where weston wasjit
the present time

  setting em up at the bar eph i

guess- here the hotel man paused

to laugh for bliss wras on his way

  i guess joe continued orms
that between bill plarney and eph
b iss this wreston is in for a pretty
good time it isnt often a fellow
comes to fairlawn with so much visible
means of support showing holy cat
here comes the first run of shad for
the county fair next week its the
cohen brothers joe tell your brother
to come to work to-morrow and when
you are not behind the counter see that
he is

  two men alike as peas who had a
moment before dismounted from a
large covered wagon at the stepping-
the gift bearecrs



stone in front of the palatial were now
approaching the desk with a miscel-
laneous assortment of bags which they
threw in a heap before the grating
cut from the same pattern one was a
replica of the other down to the large
diamond which sparkled on a somewhat
cigarette-soiled hand the palatial
knew them well for they had made
their headquarters there for many years
during the continuance of the orange
county fair the elder of the two was
called ike and the other morris

  hello jeff hello choe  greeted
ike shaking hands with the proprietor
and clerk in turn back again to the
old homestead you see you haf the
same cook  the blackberry pie should
be running good now and of course
we get the same rate and the same
room mid bath

  the same boys replied the host
genially everything is the same only
the tomato crop was bad this year and
we couldnt put up the ketchup as
usual and we have had no rain so the
blackberries are scarce and we are fur-
nishing only one piece of pie to a cus-
tomer and the old room is taken by a
party named greyson and the rates
have advanced fifty cents a day per per-
son-and without

  midout what jeff

  it wont make any difference to you
fellows ike asserted the proprietor
tapping the largest of the bags with his
foot i see you have brought em all
back

  those things you is kicking and
maybe breaking jeff are rings for the
cane stands we haf that concession
this year again i ask you what is
the mklout

  towel service ike we cant af-
ford to trade our turkish line for those
huckabacks of yours-that you packed
by mistake from the hubbard house
in cambridge the towel exchange at
the palatial went out with the old pro-
hibition law

  vy jeff ve-

  another thing ike when the fair
is on and we are feeding so many peo-
ple that we have to let them in and
out of the dining room in bunches no-

body is going to eat a t-steak dowtn to
the bone and then send it back because
it w asnt cooked right and twto ine a
room means just that-no subletting
this year ive provided a lot of cots
myself and im going to put them in
the corridors

  vy jeff those was friends of ours

last year and-

  they must have been ike when
they let you store them away five abreast
in the bed like sardines and paid you
fifty cents a head for the privilege
what did i say to you morris 
said ike turning to his brother so
soon as a man makes a piece of change
somebody vants to take it from him
ve vill go mid the- blake house i
heard last year they set a good table-
mid everything mid and nothing mid-
out

  when you get there ike do me a
favor said orms easily tell aus-
tin the fellow in charge there to hitch
up a rig and go to the depot for some
baggage he can take the horse that
is in the old dining room if he likes
joe the clerk laughed and observed
mr orms owns the blake house
now and has turned it into a livery
stable

  ike emitted a forced laugh

  ve was joking jeff vy the pa-
latial is like home to us

  thats the trouble returned the
proprietor quickly i forgot to say
also that the pool table is for the pur-
pose of playing on-pool when you
go there i want to hear the balls keep
dropping in the pockets no my baby
wants a pair of shoes or come seven
come eleven this season

  the gong over the desk now pealed
for supper and the cohen brothers
making hasty ablutions passed into
the dining room the head waitress
with a nod of recognition escorted
them to a table near a window over-
looking a stretch of green sward out-
side greyson entering the room
shortly afterward was assigned to the
same table as he seated himself he
bowed courteously to the cohens and
in the small talk that followed he men-
tioned his name


the popular magazine

  from his seat at the table greyson
could see a knot of people gathering
around some runners who were don-
ning spiked shoes presently he ob-
served his speed boy frank mills ap-
pear in street attire and following
him a wild-appearing fellow whose
advent was hailed by the crowd with
a burst of laughter morris cohen
observing greysons look of interest
remarked

  those fellows are practicing forthe
dash at the fair next week jeff orms
who is interested in those things has
put up a large cash prize and every-
body who can run a lick at ail is prac-
ticing a bunch of runners who com-
peted at the fair in cambridge last
week are entered also

  i see said greyson following with
his eye mills now lumbering over the
staked course that fellow there he
added indicating mills seems to have
more motion than speed

  the waitress putting dowrn some
dishes on the table glanced out of the
window and laughed

  that is austin she said who
works for mr orms in the livery sta-
ble he can fight better than he can
run i guess he came to fairlawn a
week ago whipped our constable and
got arrested mr orms was so tickled
he gave austin a job at once but
he cant run at all

  how is that mary asked ike
cohen

  the waitress laughed again

  do you see that fellow there prac-
ticing starts she said that is will
wirth a college fellow whose home
is here he won the race at the cam-
bridge fair austin and he have been
running against each other three nights
now and austin owes him all the
wages he has coming to him saturday
he cant run even as fast as crazy
sparks the fellow out there the crowd
is laughing at

  another piece of steak now-mary
said ike cohen and the waitress made
another trip to the kitchen

  greyson laughed knowingly and
dropping his voice remarked

  i wish i knew a first-classrunner

from a surface survey i should say
that the pickings here ought to be very
fair  then he gazed attentively at
his salt container

  morris cohen rolled an eye at his
brother and said stressing the your
what is your line sir 

  im traveling for my health just
now

  there was a pause occasioned by the
noisy entrance of sleazy accompanied
by bill harney and eph bliss the
former had evidently decided not to
go home for supper ike cohen slued
around to look after them and mut-
tered under his breath the bugler
is in love again then turning to
greyson he said in an explanatory
way

  veil this is as healthy a place as
anoder last year some fellers i knew
ran a shell game for three whole days
outside the fair grounds gate and they
didnt work any more all winter
wow

  do you know boys the more i see
of this burg the better i like it before
my health broke down i was by way
of doing well and im working heavy
now how fast do you suppose for
instance this college rah-rah can step
the century 

  the track was fast at cambridge
and he won in eleven flat jerked mor-
ris cohen quickly they thought he
was a wonder there and i wouldnt
be surprised here also

  how fast is the fastest man you
know  inquired greyson

  well morris said we know a
fellow and if he is out now and off
the bilge water and one or two other
things he can give this wirth jgpaybe
ten feet in a hundred and this austin
fifteen

  take off five feet for bad behavior
then and he is still good enough to win
theyre off how soon can you get
this fellow for me 

  maybe he is working now morris
observed this season of the year is
the right one for the speed boys zit-
tel-thats his name-used to work with
a big crew until the game went bad
when he is home he lives next door to
the gift bearers



us he will come for me provided he
happens to be there

  how much asked greyson reach-
ing for his roll

  lets see figured morris six-
fifty for car fare a dollar for the eats
and say two more for the telegram
including stalling off eph bliss bliss
is the fellow behind you that came in
with the little hick who somehow dont
look natural to me call it a ten-dollar
note tf we sent more zittel would
only fall into temptation

  greyson passed him the money and
said

  have him come on at once but
i dont get you on that bliss stuff
where does he tee off

  he is the town bugler and night
watchman combined growled ike
cohen vonce morris and me had a
deal all framed up he came along and
spoiled it ven the fair is on he is a
special officer and busier than a lot of
red ants under a stone ve vill haf to
call a friend of ours at albany on the
long-distance phone and haf him send
the telegram from there if ve left
it in town bliss vould be sure to see it
thats good judgment commended
greyson by the way did this zittel
ever work with jimmy dars crew and
what does he do in the off season 
we dont know the fellow you men-
tion morris declared there were
a lot of crews out together when the
going was good zittel when we left
new york was working as a waiter
in a club called-what is the name of
that place ike 

  the malmarte ike said

  thats it-the malmarte did you
ever hear of it mr greyson this
club took a greek for his hotel and
sold it for over a million and a half
dollars

  in a general way answered grey-
son startled but about the incident
you mention i heard it differently the
greek sold his place and afterward be-
came demented

  n g returned morris laughing
the leader of my district big john
coffee belongs to the malmarte and
he gave us the low-down on it

  that so  well it doesnt matter
when zittel arrives i shall want to
see him at once we better have him
met at the station and ill meet him
at the outskirts some place will you
make his entry at once 

  certainly ill arrange to have it
sent from cambridge to orms he has
charge of the races

  mary the waitress who had been
making many trips to the rear now
served the dessert standing at the
window she laughed heartily

  crazy sparks has just fallen head
over heels she exclaimed its a
wonder he wouldnt quit and go home

i can run as fast as he can myself

  is he really a bug mary morris
asked

  on racing only they say he used
to be a good runner at one time too
he has been farming it on a place he
owns and a few days ago somebody
discovered slate on his land sparks
sold his place for over ten thousand
dollars and ever since he has been
hanging around town doing nothing
the day after austin came to fair-
lawn sparks got in an argument with
him about how fast they could run
they had a race and austin fell and
ever since sparks has been practicing
with the others

  that does no harm to any one
greyson remarked with a smile

  thats so laughed mary but
you see wirth and austin and the
others are kidding him so that he will
bet his money that he wins at the fair
they havent got him up to that point
yet but they will later there they
let him win that time its a shame
and with a frown she brushed the
table and hurried away

  i am going to get some of sparks
money when he starts wagering
chortled greyson of course you fel-
lows are entitled to come in on this
how shall we arrange it among our-
selves r

  of course greyson we have some
money morris said slowdy and of
course we are pretty well-known here
so we better not bet ourselves i sug-
gest that you bet as much as you can


the popular magazine

get down on zittel and we will take
half is this satisfactory

  perfectly answered greyson
and of course greyson said ike
with emphasis the money must be
placed in jeff orms hands and ve
must know from jeff greyson the
amount you vager ve know jeff veil
-and you are traveling for your health
-not

  thats quite proper and fair ike
greyson laughed there is no limit
i assume as to the amount i shall bet
the more the better said morris
we can always get money for a sure
thing

  and of course you vager ike as-
serted mid the understanding that if
zittel dont start the bets dont go
whats the matter with you ike 
morris asked in surprise of course
that is understood

  ven i bet money morris i vant
nothing understood i vant everything
known morris snapped ike

  be it known then ike that it shall
be as you direct greyson remarked
easily i think ill throw out a few
lines at once how about our genial
host for a start

  try him by all means morris di-
rected he has the coin if he cares
to wager ike and i will get off the
telegram to zittel so long

  mr orms was sitting on the porch
watching the runners greyson ap-
proached him and at the hotel mans
suggestion drew a chair alongside
orms had a split-second watch in his
hand with which he was timing the
speeders after a silence of a few
moments greyson remarked

  i see you are interested in foot-
racing mr orms

  racing of all kinds rather as a
matter of fact i have put up the money
for the foot race at the fair these fel-
lows here are practicing for

  i surmise you get part of it back
by increased business at the palatial
observed greyson dryly

  i always try to have one hand wash
the other orms returned in a similar
tone of voice it is the game itself

however that interests me mostly
wirth our local flyer there had done
three hundreds to-night in eleven-two
that is pretty good stepping consider-
ing that he isnt pressed much

  they were saying at the supper
table that he is taking advantage of
the other two

  he is winning austins money and
making a fool out of sparks at any
rate it is a peculiar thing about this
fellow austin he runs the second
fifty faster than the first the last
time he ran it in five-four he is out
of his distance i guess

  possibly he gets off badly that
makes considerable difference in a
dash i imagine

  that is probably it expect to be
in fairlawn long mr greyson

  for the fair only i have a friend
who starts a horse in one of the races
that is why i am here

  can your friends horse win 

  he can-and will

  i am a little partial to good horse-
flesh myself like to have a fair-sized
bet down too when i know something
i forgot what you said the horses name
was

  greyson laughed and then said
evenly

  ttiat is kind of you mr orms it
keeps his price from being spoiled
who is this fellow austin another
local man

  i thought you sat at marys table
at supper  orms said with a smile

  she couldnt well get into her stride
mr orms some people i sat with
were hungry

  running to form as usual i see

well this dawson-

  austin you said his name was i
thought

  that is it he has been in town
only a short time but i guess you might
say he was a local man too he works
for me but sparks isnt he lives
in the next town

i was only trying to get a line on
this foot race greyson explained i
would like to bet some money on it
myself provided i know something 
orms laughed a moment
the gift beacrecrs



  possibly we could trade he said
suppose i give you a tip on the foot
race in exchange for the name of your
friends horse

  all right but there will be pools
sold on this race at the fair and none
i take it on the foot race it is a
question of price mr orms give me
your tip now and ill give you mine
the day of the race

 orms thought a moment then
chuckled

  that is a mixed-up proposition but
ill do this ill give you the names
of two boys who wont win now for
the information you will give me later
and there will be a great deal of money
wagered on their chances too

  that is a go name them grey-
son had nothing to lose

  the local fellows wirth and aus-
tin

  i thought wirth beat a big field at
cambridge he said he should be
able to repeat shouldnt he

  everybody thinks he can but me
i know that the fellow who came sec-
ond to him in cambridge can beat him
a couple of steps his name is hall
and his father runs the hubbard house
in cambridge i sav him after the race
and he told me he slipped getting off the
mark

  that sounds to me like a stall re-
turned greyson quickly i always did
say that once a fellow was beaten-
prize fight foot race or anything else
-the other man has the indian sign
on him and he laughed inwardly
for events were shaping themselves to
his full satisfaction

  after pausing a moment to let this
dictum sink in he continued

  i am one of those mr orms who
always believes in patronizing home in-
dustries how much should you say
offhand i can get down that either of
the local boys wins 

  i dont know about you but know-
ing everybody around here i can guar-
antee at least a couple of thousand

doll ars but i warn-

  here is the money said greyson
quickly stripping that amount from his
roll

  ive got it laughed orms putting
the money in his wallet

  greyson looked at him a moment
narrowly and declared

  when im at home and somebody
says that it means that themoney is
already covered

  wherever the white man has been
there is nothing new drawled orms
we get the new ford jokes heie by
telegraph consider -your money cov-
ered

  now that i knowt that laughed
greyson i should like to press that bet
a little

  double it if you like providing
nothing is said i am president of the
bank here and some of the depositors
have scruples against betting

  all right put these bills along-
side the others they have been to-
gether so long it would be a shame to
separate them this town looks like
a place where a man can get plenty
of action i think ill stick around a
while after the fair is over

 orms looked at greyson and
chuckled

  you are the second man to arrive
in fairlawn to-day who said the same
thing he mentioned here comes the
other one now ill introduce you
mr weston shake hands with mr
greyson

  i met mr greyson this afternoon
inside sleazy grinned he was hav-
ing a conniption cat fit at the time-
maybe on account of seeing my gold
brick you feeling better now mr
greyson 

  much-thank you snapped grey-
son getting to his feet i forgot to
take my medicine after supper where
is the best cigar store in town mr
orms 

across the street but the best cigars
are in the case at the palatial have
joe show you some of our specials 
thanks said greyson walking off
i wonder what that fellow does for
a living asked sleazy

  hes a speculator i understand-
live stock

  he looks like j butcher fed up on
his own beef at that did you notice


the ppuur magazine

his full short neck with the blood
trying to burst through  somehow
most butchers have the same look
thats true a sort of sign of the
profession now our men here in fair-
lawn mostly all have all callous horny
hands from working with stone that
is their sign usually i remember tom
harneys were the same way-after
he came back from the black hills
sleazy glanced at his white well-
kept hands and smiled

  when a man gets hold of a lot of
money suddenlike he dont know how
to spend it he said when i came
down from alaska there was a girl in
a barber shop-i liked her because she
had red hair-and i had her go over
my hands every day and now look at
them

  i am the hotel man said then
after a pause he added joe was
telling me you and tom were partners
in the west now that you are here
with so much money it is too bad he
is dead he died fast too

  bill says his wife is sick too and
i want toget your advice about some-
thing

  bills wife must have been taken
sick suddenly then orms asserted
i saw her coming down out of law-
yer holts office with bill not over ten
minutes ago

  whats that said sleazy sharply
and without waiting for a reply he went
on

   right after supper bill harney
made a demand on me for one half the
amount of money i have in the brick
now tom was all right and a good
fellow and if he lived i would be glad
to give him his share according to our
agreement but i dont like bill at
all and im not going to give him a
single cent 

  well a while ago he came to me and
said his wife was sick and that she
would not believe a word he said-
that i was in town or that there was
any agreement with tom and so on
so on account of him not being home
for supper bill wanted to know if i
would give him a statement about the

gold so that he could square himself
and i did

did bill tell you what to say
asked the hotel man with interest
come to think of it he did why
that will be holt the lawyers act
said orms grimly i had some trouble
with him and i know how he works
what is the answer sleazy asked
really puzzled

  bill couldnt hold you to the agree-
ment on your say-so alone i imagine
wreston but now that he has your
signed statement he can however
you will know shortly here comes
holt now and he means business
well ill be-ditched  exclaimed
sleazy and he meant it orms got
out of his chair to leave but when
sleazy asked him to remain he sat down
again

  holt a scrawny individual clothed
in a frayed frock coat and wearing a
silk hat of ancient vintage was ap-
proaching arms swinging violently
and heavy watch chain bobbing up and
down following in his wake came a
number of hangers-on probably divin-
ing his errand standing directly in
front of sleazy he asked formally
are you mr john weston

  sleazy nodded assent crook as he
was he felt his - gorge rising at har-
neys summary action

  then holt continued represent-
ing my client william harney admin-
istrator of the estate of one thomas
harney deceased i now make a de-
mand on you for one half of the net
proceeds of certain moneys now in the
form shape and manner of a cube of
gold which cube is now in the safe of
the palatial hotel and at the same time
i tender you fifteen hundred dollars
the same being one-half of the net pro-
ceeds of the estate of the said thomas
harney deceased-all of which is in
accordance with a certain agreement
entered upon between you and the said
thomas harney and evidenced by a
statement in writing signed by you
which i have in my possession

  its getting rather dark now
judge said sleazy and i cant see
that fifteen-hundred tender you spoke
the gift beaers



of aforesaid would you mind plac-
ing the said sum in the palm of my
right hand 

  the tender i mentioned sir is a
fiction of law said the lawyer hastily
inasmuch as half the value of the
gold now in your possession at least
constructively amounts to more than
the sum tendered the latter will be de-
ducted from the former your answer

      

sir

   wre said sleazy biting off each
word according to the stathooks in
such cases made and provided includ-
ing tort mayhem and trespass on the
case and between ourselves severally
and jointly-for i see the whole town
is here now-you go tell bill harney
he will never get a dog-gone cent from
me and you tell him for me afore-
said as aforesaid and in toto judas-
judasprudence that i can lick him as
small as i am and you tell him also
and again that if smoky weston had
his gun writh him he would shoot the
said bill harney at three hundred
paces through the lobe of his left ear
you heard him threaten my client
mr orms i call you to witness that
you heard him shouted the lawryer

  i couldnt testify that i did
drawled orms flies in the dining
room are making so much racket fight-
ing over a lump of sugar that i cant
hear anything else

   i couldnt either came eph bliss
voice from out the crowd all i could
hear was the echo of holts voice
the lawyer turned to sleazy again
and said angrily

  in a word weston do i understand
you to deny your obligation in this
matter 

  in two words holt-you do
very well sir we shall see to-
morrow 

   thats right judge its pretty dark
now step off with the right foot go-
ing down the steps and haul the door
to-or three the hinges are rusty and
need oiling

  frowning the lawyer hastened away
and the crowd gradually dispersed
sleazy lit a cigarette and smoked on
in silence for a time presently he

laid a hand on the hotel mans knee
and said in a troubled voice

  i need your advice more than ever
nowr mr orms what would you ad-
vise me to do do you think bill
harney can hold me to the agreement
i made with tom

  under the circumstances i think
so if i were you i would remove
the gold from the hotel to-night if
you wish i will rent you a box at the
bank and you can store it there we
can remove it from the hotel safe after
the crowrd gets off the street

  that is very kind o you mr
orms returned sleazy ill do as
you suggest of course but i dont
understand yet why i ought to move it
unless i miss my guess you will
know to-morrow orms said crypti-
cally and sleazy was forced to be
content

  when the clock in front of the jew-
elry store across the street from the
palatial marked the hour of one sleazy
and orms went to the bank the street
was completely deserted orms un-
locked the door and after revolving
the combination on the safe for a mo-
ment swung the vault door open piled
atop of one another on a shelf in the
rear of the vault sleazy saw a num-
ber of black-japanned boxes some with
names printed across the fronts but
the most without lettering orms took
down one of the latter and sleazy
placed the brick therein

   ill tell the cashier about this matter
in the morning remarked orms as
he placed the box in its original posi-
tion he will send you a rental bill
within a few days he then closed
the vault and accompanied sleazy back
to the hotel when saying good night
he chuckled

  now let the learned lawyer take
such steps as seem to him to be proper
in the premises

   you are pretty well up in that stuff
arent you mr orms sleazy re-
marked

  ive had a reason to be returned
orms switching off the lights in the
hotel lobby

  sleazy piled off to bed he lay in


the popular magazine

deep thought for a long time finally
he grinned in the darkness and ad-
justed his head on the pillow

  its just bullhead luck i know he
muttered to himself but it should
work like a charm oh you naughty
judge holt

  then he heard a wagon scrunching
along the gravel underneath his win-
dow he got out of bed and peered
through the curtain the carriage
stopped and -mary the waitress and
sparks got out orms joined them
and for some time the three carried
on an animated conversation inter-
spersed with bursts of laughter

  thats a funny combination mur-
mured sleazy that fellow sparks is
one of the foot-racers i saw practicing
to-night well they seem to be hav-
ing a good time about something i
wonder how greyson is coming on

  then yawning he sought his bed and
slept the sleep of the just

  it was late the following morning
when the ex-jockey appeared below
stairs to his surprise holt was in
the lobby as sleazy looked at him
with curiosity the lawyer advanced
and with a gesture that had something
theatrical about it handed him a legal-
appearing document

  greetings judge sleazy observed
ah what have we here what say-
eth the little billit-dux  shame on
you judge and so early in the morn-
ing

  orms who was behind the desk
laughed holt isnt playing any fa-
vorites this morning weston he de-
clared ive got one of those things
too

  thats an injunction said the law-
yer shortly it forbids you weston
and mr orms or the agent or agents
of either from removing a certain
package or parcel from the safe of
the palatial to wit a cube of gold
and this he added presenting sleazy
with another document is the bill in
the action of harney versus wteston
for an accounting

  the injunction seems to be de-pro-
pos judge but why bill me harney
retained you not me i am going to

hire a good lawyer at once where
can i find one mr orms

  there arent any nearer than cam-
bridge answered orms innocently
weve never had a good one in this
town

  sleazy laughed then said to holt
have no fear judge i would no
more think of removing that brick
from the safe now than i would of
letting bill harney get any part of it
i always respcct the law mr orms
if you see me attempting to open that
door i authorize you to call the judge
at once

  you cant weston the hotel man
asserted with a fleeting wink i have
locked the compartment and have given
the key to mr holt i will take no
chances

  you had better not declared holt
going toward the door

  among those scattered around the
lobby the jockey observed greyson
talking with the two men he had seen
in the dining room tine evening before
he nodded to greyson who bowed
coldly in return and went for his
breakfast

  when the door closed behind sleazy
morris cohen asked 

  whats all this to-do about grey-
son 

  greyson explained telling of the pu-
tative westons arrival in fairlawn and
relating the conversation weston had
with the hotel clerk when he had
concluded morris remarked 

  weston must be on the up and up
then maybe a fellow like that would
tickle the pasteboards a bit if he was
properly approached would you ask
him greyson when he comes out
and will we split his money three ways
or go every man for his lonesome
sure ill ask him said greyson
quickly but about splitting his money
-i dont think that will pay a fellow
like him who haggles about bus fare
and hotel rates wouldnt be liable to
lose much money in a poker game
thats right chimed in ike mor-
ris has me in over my head mid auction
pinochle now and maybe i should get
the gift bejcrecrs



my money back from this here wes-
ton

  it is so ordered said greyson
when sleazy returned greyson
called him over and suggested the
game the jockey hesitated and
asked 

  what limit 

  say all jacks and a fifty-cent ante
morris urged hurriedly

  sleazy laughed and shook his head
in negation

  thats no game for a grown man
he asserted we teethe children on
that in my country but make it reg-
ular draw sky limit and ill dally for
a few revolving days

  that suits us better still morris
said lets adjourn to our room
they played until far into the night
the cohens lost steadily they could
not understand why finally ike
sprang from his seat in a burst of an-
ger throwing the cards on the floor

  s enough he cried never be-
fore did i see such a game ven i deal
and morris gets a hand he dont get
a bet and ven morris deals and i get
a hand i dont get a bet-but ven
veston deals or greyson deals i get
maybe a good hand and lots of action
but i lose and morris loses and veston
vins and greyson vins 

  sleazy looked at him in mock sur-
prise and jerked out

  why the way you talk i am jus-
tified in believing that you brothers are
playing partners  ho  ho  the devil
must be in the cards to-night

  thats vy im q-vitting ike roared
i cant make oud vich is vich

  well so long craftsmen sleazy
said getting to his feet maybe some
other time we will play again i just
dote on poker

  maybe ve vill-nod said ike bit-
terly looking after him

  greyson patted ike on the back and
laughed

  cheer up ike our speed boy will
be here to-morrow and in a few days
well blow the cover off the town
should ve not returned ike
mournfully morris and me vill haf
to go to work again as it is now

ve vill haf to go mid the nest egg for
our share of the zittel bet

  how much have you up on him now
greyson  asked morris

four thousand morris but i ex-
pect shortly to place a great deal more
when greyson was going downstairs
to the palatial barber shop the follow-
ing day he encountered sleazy coming

up-

  how much bill greyson whis-
pered

  three-fifty and you bob

  four hundred fiat greyson re-
turned handing sleazy twenty-five dol-
lars that squares us on the cohen
thing and they passed on their sep-
arate ways

 the up train on the following
morning brought zittel the speed boy
to fairlawn waiting for him at the
station was a conveyance from the pa-
latial livery driven by austin-or
rather mills as zittel a rangy
anaemic fellow descended to the plat-
form ike cohen beckoned to him from
some distance away following ikes
pointed finger zittel went around to
the back of the station cohen shak-
ing hands directed him to get in the
conveyance and the driver would take
him to a previously made rendezvous
to meet greyson

  zittel started at the name and
asked

  whats this fellows name-again
ike 

  greyson robert is the fiist name
i think do you know him 

  i knew of a guy by that name but
he was doing highbrow stuff is this
fellow traveling with a small flossy
fellow looking like money from head-
quarters 

  no-vorking alone

  that wouldnt be my man then
when do i run and how 

  greyson vill tell you all about that
get in the wagon now

  dont say wagon ike i dont like
the sound of that woid shivered zittel
say hack or something like that it
sounds better

  as mills got out to let zittel in the
latters jaw dropped in sheer amaze-
ment mills however with a signifi-
cant pressure on the others arm
quickly boosted him to the seat and
clucking to the horse drovfc on when
a corner of the road hid them from
cohens view zittel exclaimed

  tickle me with a feather frank i
want to laugh but cant what are
you doing here 

  i am going to run too zit and at
the present writing win

  then what am i doing here
search me greyson will tell you
in a few minutes but as long as we
are here together chock-a-block lets
see if wre cant do a little figuring for
mills zittel and company im pretty

well heeled myself at present and-

  stop frank before you tempt me
an i fall answer me one question is
this greyson a malmartite 

  mills nodded assent

  then its all off between us big
john the boss of my ward is a mem-
ber too and theres a couple of in-
dictments an one or two other things
hangin over my head im sorry
frank but i got to be on the level
its too bad at that for my mouth is
waterin an i can smell oodles of
money

  they rode on in silence for a time
at length well out from the town they
came to a stretch of road as level as
a billiard table and well shaded by trees
that formed an arch overhead a horse
attached to buggy was tied to a fence
by the roadside and greyson some dis-
tance away with his coat removed and
shirt sleeves rolled back was measur-
ing off a course with a steel tape mills
pulled up and zittel said with -a sigh
its him all right i was hopin
against hope but its no use though
it cuts me like a knife frank ive got
to be on the level

  its tough i know zit returned
mills with heartfelt sympathy but we
are caught where we cant wiggle
greyson sauntered up and eyed zit-
tel sternly

  i thought i knew you he said sig-

nificantly you are one of coffeys
henchmen is zittel your right name 
yes mr greyson

  who hired you zittel 

  the cohens mr greyson

  who are you working for zittel
  you mr greyson

  very well i see you are a bright
fellow nowr we will get down to cases
in this coming race zittel you finish
just behind mills you understand
dont you  not in front of or even
with mills-but just behind

  mills laughed and said

  thats just where he ought to fin-
ish mr greyson we are old pals
and last sifmmer we worked down
through jersey together i am a step
faster in the hundred than him when
we both are in training

  are you in training now zittel
asked greyson how fast can you
step the century right here 

  ive been workin out for the past
twro weeks zittel said intendin to
do a little gypin on my own account
if nothin better turned up in the mean-
time im train tired now but i ought
to be able to pump it in ten-one

  good  greyson said both of you
fellows will have to show me some real
running now you will find spiked
shoes in the wagon there get them
on and turn me in as low a card as
you are able i have a lot of money
wagered on this coming race and ex-
pect to have more i also have a split-
second timepiece the best made and
you fellows can take it from me im
not going to give you any the best of
it in this trial heat

  the runners divested themselves of
superfluous clothing and donned the
running shoes

  greyson marked the start by drawing
a line across the roadway with a piece
of stick he informed the speed- boys
that he would drop a handkerchief for
the starting signal after placing them
on the line he walked a distance to-
ward the finish in deep thought and
then retraced his steps when he had
come to the runners again he said
there is a hundred in it c o d
boys for the man who finishes first
the gift cbeacrecrs



and another hundred to be split be-
tween you if the winner beats ten-two
that inducement should take a kink
or two out of your leg muscles on
your marks again

  when greyson was out of earshot
mills whispered out of the corner of
his mouth

  the second hundred is gone zit
the road is too cuppy

  nay nay frank returned the
other greyson cant see the line he
drew from the finish we will move
up ten feet and start from there

  its a go move up now before
he turns we will split the whole thing
fifty-fifty and ill lay you ten even i
can trim you at that

  thats a bet crouch low on the
mark now so that he wont notice the
difference make that ten twenty if
you like you can beat me at a hun-
dred but never at any shorter dis-
tance

  a bet get off flying zit

  greyson now arrived at the finish
turned to see his speed boys in position
to start facing them he held the
handkerchief out at a right angle to
his body and before releasing his fin-
gers pressed the stem of his stop

watch

  now they will have to go some to
get the added hundred he muttered
w ith a grim smile

  but go they did like greyhounds
slipped from the leash the speed boys
came down the course with the perfect
mechanical action so characteristic of
the ideal runner as one man they
came on heads erect chests out and
arms working with the rhythm of pis-
tons at the finish zittel literally
threw himself across the line to win by
a scant head greyson purposely
slowing the action stopped his watch
then he held it up in surprise it reg-
istered ten seconds fiat

  greyson looked alternately from one
to the other with suspicion

  this is almost too good to be true
he remarked slowly

  its the track mr greyson zittel
jerked out it is so springy under
foot we couldnt help running fast he

stooped and gathering a handful of
surface dirt examined it closely
what is this stuff anyway  he
asked i never saw it before

  that is shale dust greyson an-
swered relieved that probably ac-
counts for the time you made

  and mills observed the track at
the fair grounds is made with the same
stuff i was there last night and if
anything it is faster than this road
here that race of ours is in al-
ready

  here is your money boys grey-
son chuckled after mills wins i
shall do the handsome by you both
now then zittel lets see your service
on a few questions imagine you are
on the witness stand and ike cohen is
cross-examining you you ought to
feel at home there i surmise ques-
tion 

  do you know this greyson

  no i thought i did but he isnt
the same man zittel responded
quickly

  mills w

  no i never heard of him can he
run

  when greyson timed you to-day
how fast did you run

  ten-two but i was tired
good ejaculated greyson i like
that it shows good judgment ques-
tion  what did greyson say to you
after the trial 

  dont say trial ike say test
greyson said theres two hundred
in it for you zittel after the race
and five per cent of the winnings 
hm  not so good declared grey-
son dryly but his eye twinkling how-
ever the two hundred goes and the
five per cent will be split between you
and mills he is on a straight hiring
but i will waive that one more ques-
tion zittel and you may step down
is this greyson on the up and up
right as a church ike i never
met a man i liked better at first sight
greyson laughed and patted the wit-
ness on the back saying you will
do zittel and the last wras very nice
of you look me up when you get
back to town and ill put you in the


the popular magazine

way of making some money in the
meantime think up some stall to use in
fairlawn and keep in good shape so
that the cohens will be disposed to bet
heavily on you we will get back to
the burg now

  and as for you mills greyson
continued immediately after you ar-
rived here with zittel i sent you on to
the next town to purchase some ciga-
rettes and when you returned zittel
and i were seated in the carriage i
drove here talking that story goes
for both of you you understand

  the speed boys nodded and getting
into their conveyance drove off grey-
son smoked for a time meditatively
and then unhitching his horse fol-
lowed

  as his carriage vanished around a
bend in the road there was the sound
of bushes crackling and from the
fringe of wood that bordered the course
jeff orms appeared taking a tape
from his pocket he measured care-
fully the distance from the actual start-
ing place of the sped boys back to the
line greyson had drawn then he mut-
tered to himself

  ninety-eight yards roughly in ten-
one eh it wont do greyson  it wont
do at all austin will have to step
faster than that to win i wonder now
what the other fellow is doing here
seems to me his rear elevation was
familiar sorry i couldnt catch the
conversation thought there would be
something doing when austin came to
town the old old game

  then plunging into the undergrowth
he struck out across lots toward the
village

iv

  it was now monday and the orange
county fair was to open on the mor-
row to -continue for the three follow-
ing days the palatial hotel was filled
almost to suffocation and late-arriving
guests were compelled to sleep on cots
stretched along the several corridors
strangers were everywhere in fact and
the clarion came out with a special
edition devoted to the manifold attrac-
tions of the occasion

  jeff orms had caused to be erected
in the lobby of the palatial a bulletin
board conspicuously posted on this
was the list of entrants for the foot
race and greyson and morris cohen
stood before it engaged in a whispered
conversation cohen held in his hand a
list of the runners who had recently
competed at cambridge comparing
this list with the one on the board he
remarked

  as far as i can see there are no
sleepers here greyson the lists are
the same with the addition of austin
the plug who ha been chasing wirth
home so often for the past few days
zittel and this crazy fellow sparks
regarding him mary was saying at
the table this noon that austin and
wirth had worked him up to the pitch
of betting his money you had better
take all he offers i think

  ill page him at once greyson an-
swered he was on the porch a few
minutes ago and some townspeople
were kidding him along let us go out
and ill see what i can do with him
as they came on the porch they
saw sparks in the center of a crowd
that was gyrating about heckling him
the runner had a roll of bills in his
tightly clutched fingers and was defy-
ing the gathering to bet eph bliss
laughing with great enjoyment was
leaning against a pillar watching the
show

  what is going on eph  asked
morris

  its sparks grinned bliss they
say he has all the money he got for
his quarry land with him and he is
taking all bets look he has caught
my eye now

  hey  eph sparks called out
usent i now to beat wirth running
when we were boys

  sure you used returned bliss but
ill bet you ten right now you dont
win at the fair

  put it up  shouted sparks burst-
ing through the press come in the
hotel and put the money in jeff orms
hands and ill bet you as much more
as you like the same way

  the crowd pushing and jostling fol-
the gift bejirecrs



lowed sparks and bliss to the lobby
orms who was seated behind the rail-
ing talking to the clerk got to his feet
when the room filled so quickly

  whats all this he cried the
fair starts to-morrow not to-night out
on the porch you fellows and give
the guests breathing room what is
the matter now sparks 

  bliss and i want you to hold a bet
for us mr orms do you want to
bet more eph 

  bliss replied in the negative they
placed the money and bliss walked
away orms was remonstrating with
sparks telling him that he stood no
chance of winning when greyson ap-
proached and with a wink to orms
said

  i happened to overhear your con-
versation outside mr sparks ill be
glad to accommodate you on any wager
you may care to make that you do not
win at the fair how much shall we
say 

  this much sparks said throwing
a sheaf of bills on the counter

  one moment sparks broke in
orms this is a lot of money to
invest in such an uncertain thing as a
foot race be advised by me and dont
do it

  thats my business mr orms
sparks retorted and if you dont want
to hold the wager we can easily find
some one else who will

  all right sparks ill hold it orms
replied with finality im not your
guardian have it your own way
greyson with a sly laugh remarked
evenly

of course sparks i am betting that
you dont win-taking the field against
you as it were that is understood 
sure wirth can beat all the others
i guess

  very well here is my money mr
orms greyson said depositing an
equal amount to that of sparks

  while orms was putting the wager
money in the safe greyson sought out
morris cohen who had stated that he
would be found at the bar ike had
joined his brother in the meantime
approaching them greyson said

  ib p

  the money is up and this is the
landlords birthday boys if you dont
mind ill have your share now

  sure ve vill gif yofu a check at
vonce ike declared reaching in his
pocket for his check book how much
do you say greyson

  no check ike but money grey-
son bit off thats what i gave orms
-money

  ike laughed

  then ve vill not take your say-so
greyson but jeffs ve vill get the
correct amount from him

  that suits me ike you fellows
go to the case and buy some cigars
ill ask him while you are there
allowing the cohens a start of a few
moments greyson went to the desk
orms was seated chuckling over an
article in the clarion with his mem-
orandum book and pencil in his hand
greyson calling to the hotel man said
i want to verify my wagers on the
foot race mr orms how much have
i bet all told 

  seven thousand dollars returned
orms promptly

  thanks that is as i make it let
us have some cigars give the cohens
some of those specials of yours i
am quite certain they will find them
better than they usually smoke

  none of those for me ike laughed
gif me stogies instead jeff they vill
last longer then the three conspira-
tors adjourned to a table in the rear
room of the cafe as ike counted out
thirty-five hundred dollars he re-
marked 

  should zittel make his feet go
round now like an electric fan i
shouldnt hate him none the more
he should win easily greyson de-
clared

  if he dont ike morris said we
will have to go back to the machines
again teamwofk it will be ike you
and me and the kid brother

  the cohens went to their room and
greyson glancing at his shoes pro-
ceeded  to the bootblack stand eph
bliss was just ahead of him with a
muslin bag containing change for the
stand as greyson climbed into a chair


the popular magazine

he saw bliss after putting the money
in the till take a seat near by and light
a cigar greyson nodded to him and
bliss said with a smile i saw you get
a lot of sparks money mr greyson
you are lucky

  several bootblacks were busily pol-
ishing away and there was consider-
able clatter in the room greyson felt
a nudge on his arm sleazy was sit-
ting in the next chair

  how goes it bob  the jockey whis-
pered spilling the words from the cor-
ner of his mouth

  a copper-riveted name-woven-on-
the-selvage cinch billy its a shame
to take the money and with you 
ive still got my health the brick
and a lawsuit on my hands however
i have an appointment with my
come-on in fifteen minutes and i  as
great opes 

  who is it inquired greyson with
interest

  one jeff orms the jockey said
getting down to the floor

  as sleazy reached the door he
grinned greyson was whistling a few
bars of youll get all thats coming
to you

  if i am any judge i will the
jockey breathed but friend grey-
son i fear yours will come with reverse
spin now for jeff

  climbing the stairs he knocked on
the door of orms room upon the
command to enter he turned the knob
to meet eph bliss hurrying out as-
suming a look of concern he walked
in find seated himself orms who wras
smoking swung around in his chair
with a look of inquiry after a pause
that wtas becoming awkward the jockey
blurted out

  i reckon im up against it mr
orms

  how is that weston  the hotel
man asked kindly

  bill harney will be able to outstay
me im afraid i went over to cam-
bridge yesterday to see the lawyer as
you suggested he says that the trial
of the action harney against weston
cant be reached until the next session
of the county court in march and i

cant afford to wait that long the
truth of the matter is that aside from
the gold in the brick i am broke
you have been a pretty liberal
spender for a fact orms said how-
ever it will be all right for you to stay
on here if you wish ill be glad
to carry you what did the lawyer
say about the injunction

  i didnt tell him about our remov-
ing the gold the night before the in-
junction was served mr orms i got
thinking that maybe on account of me
being a stranger here and bill harney
an old-timer the jury would find for
him anyhow and so i determined to
have a talk with you about something
i had in mind

  yes orms said tentatively

  of course if tom harney was alive
he would be welcome to half my pile
but bill is another person my mind
is made up about him but i dont
like to be under obligations to anybody
im uneasylike when i cant pay what
i owe now you have been very
decent to me advising me what to do
in my difficulties and nobody could
ever say jack weston was ungrateful
the jockey fidgeted about for a time
as if at a loss to know how to express
what he wished to say then he con-
tinued 

 when i came to fairlawn mr
orms all i figured i owned in that
brick w-as ten thousand dollars if you
will give that amount for it the brick
is yours-and you make ten

  hm i wrould have to think about
that and injunctions are bad things
to meddle with

  sleazy laughed understanding and
remarked

  when i was- talking with the lawyer
i asked him what could have been done
to us if we had removed the gold be-
fore the injunction was served he
read it all over again and replied
absolutely nothing then he added
winking at me  its too bad you didnt
you could have disposed of it then
and i take it there are no ropes tying
you to fairlawn to await the next
term of court do you know mr
orms i think he is a good lawyer
the gift beacrecrs



  thats what i thought the hotel
man laughed but about buying the 
brick-i dont know

  why not mr orms  dont you
believe it is real gold sleazy inquired
quickly

  well im rather inclined to wes-
ton but-

  the jockey laughed again and said
frankly

  i see how it is and i dont blame
you a bit do you give it any test you
like mr orms-weigh it measure it
or try it in any way that occurs to you
and if it isnt worth twenty thousand
dollars the government has cheated me
thats all

  the hotel man drummed on the table
for a time turning the proposition over
in his mind sleazy watched him
covertly at length he returned
slowly

  that is a bargain weston we will
bring frank locke the fairlawn jew-
eler to the bank and have him test
it and if he says the brick is gold i
will buy it gladly at the price you
state is that satisfactory to you
certainly but could you give me
action on it i met this man greyson
at the bootblack stand just before i
came here and he told me he had a
sure winner at the races to-morrow

i would like to get a sizable bet on
that horse

  so thats it  orms said half to
himself

  whats it asked the jockey

  oh nothing in particular what is
the name of the horse greyson gave
you 

  he didnt to-morrow he said in
front of the grand stand

  hm  he told me the same thing
a few days ago i guess greyson is
one of those to-morrow fellows wes-
ton i would steer clear of him if
i were you

  sleazy eyed the hotel man atten-
tively he saw a semblance of sarcas-
tic smile around the corners of the
others mouth construing this to his
owfi satisfaction the jockey said
evenly

  i am obliged to you mr orms

ill take your advice i think what
horse do you like on to-morrows
card 

  swallow in the free-for-all bet
on him after the first heat his price
will be better then he is a slow starter
-i hear and my information is re-
liable

  now i am more than anxious to
get hold of some real money at once
sleazy laughed could you arrange
to have the test made to-night

  i think so locke hasnt closed his
store yet ill see him at once you
meet us at the rear door of the bank
to-night at one weston there will
be people on the street till all hours
and if bill harney learns we have gone
to the bank he will be suspicious the
gold is there holt could get a second
injunction as easily as the first one
orms went on his errand and the
jockey to his room once inside
sleazy bolted the door and drew the
window curtains then from a false
bottom in one of his grips he removed
the mahogany casket greyson had given
him from this he drew forth several
bottles containing icids of different
kinds from the bottle marked ni-
tric he filled a smaller bottle having a
peculiar cone-shaped attachment on the
neck going to the washstand he held
this in a vertical position over the bowl
the acid ran from the bottle freely
but when held at any lesser angle not
a drop escaped filling this bottle for
a second time he thrust it in his left-
hand coat pocket

  so far so good he muttered

  from another compartment of the
casket he removed several pieces of
genuine gold of various shapes some
evidently cut from the corners of a
cube and others from the edges these
he placed in his right-hand coat pocket

  all set for the test he said now
for the stall

  removing the watch which he ordi-
narily carried from the pocket of his
soft shirt he substituted another hav-
ing a swivel attached to the stem to
this swivel he joined his wtatch chain
and bending over his bed slightly he
gave a jerk of his torso the watch


the popular magazine

promptly fell from his pocket and
slight as was the shock the crystal
flew off and the works dropped from
the case placing these carefully back
in their former positions sleazy lit a
cigarette and smoked it to the end
blowing out successive rings presently
he exclaimed

  if the markings on the brick are
still plain i should be able to carry
it through one thing is certain jeff
orms doesnt suspect me

  when the clock in front of lockes
jewelry store marked twelve-fifty-five
sleazy arose and crept furtively down
the stairs and out of the palatial go-
ing through an alley to the rear of the
bank he met orms and locke at the
door the hotel man with a nod of
greeting opened the door and they
passed inside in silence their foot-
steps on the tiled floor seemed in their
loudness to be unreal to the jockey and
he wondered if they could be heard
outside by chance pedestrians

  orms introduced the jeweler and as
they shook hands sleazy noticed with
satisfaction that locke was visibly
nervous he kept glancing about as
if he expected to be caught in the act
of doing something clandestine un-
der his arm he carried wrapped in
paper a number of different articles
which when unpacked proved to be a
troy-weight scales an alcohol lamp with
a bellows attached and a jewelers
saw from a pocket of his coat he
produced a bottle of acid and a clay
retort having abbreviated handles look-
ing like thongs

  orms opened the vault and directed
the jockey to bring out the gold saying
that in order to avoid any semblance
of violating the injunction he would
not touch it until it would have passed
into his ownership sleazy did so and
noted that the markings of gold on
one surface put there by greyson were
quite distinct sleazy placed the brick
with this side underneath on a flat-
topped desk inside the office partition

  locke adjusting his scales weighed
the cube and remarked

  an ounce of pure gold is worth
twenty dollars and sixty-seven cents

this cube accordingly should be worth
exactly twenty thousand dollars-if it
is pure gold which i shall determine
at once

  he placed the alcohol lamp on the
desk lit it and then attached the bel-
lows this done he took his saw and
removed a transverse section of the
cube at one corner then he paused
to observe

  before melting this piece of gold i
have just removed i shall apply nitric
acid to the surface of the cube pure
gold is unaffected by this reagent while
brass copper and other minerals used
as alloys invariably discolor usually
turning green

  with a glass dauber he flowed the
acid on the surface of the brick sleazy
apparently an interested spectator bent
over the desk slightly and asked

  can i assist you in any way mr
locke

  as he spoke his watch sprang from
his pocket and crashed to the floor
the crystal broke into a thousand
pieces and the mechanism swept from
the case separated the parts rolling
in many different directions with an
exclamation of dismay sleazy affected
to stoop but was forestalled by both
orms and locke

  while they were on hands and knees
the jockey turned the brick and deftly
poured the nitric acid from the bottle
which he took from his pocket on the
markings thereon it was the work of
an instant also to substitute for the
piece of gold locke had cut another
of similar shape from his coat when
the spoil retrievers stood erect he was
facing them with a wry grimace
locke whose quest had been more
fruitful than the hotel mans with a
professional scrutiny of the fragments
declared 

  i am sorry mr weston this was
a very fine watch but it is broken be-
yond repair and orms remarked
that comes from carrying a watch in
the pocket of a soft shirt ive had
the same thing happen to me

  its my own fault returned the
jockey shrugging his shoulders it
serves me right for being so careless
the gift bearers



i wonder if anybody outside heard it
-fall 

  they listened a moment but all was
quiet then the jeweler taking the
piece of gold sleazy had substituted
placed it in the retort and working
the bellows blew it into a molten mass
after various tests with this he turned
to orms and said

  it is absolutely pure gold

  i reckon the rest of it is too said
sleazy peering at the brick i dont
see any of the green showing you
spoke about

  locke examined the brick his head
nodding affirmatively

  its all mint pure gold mr orms
he asserted you may safely take my
word for it

  im perfectly satisfied with your
tests the hotel man responded

  he disappeared in the vault and re-
turned shortly with a roll of bills which
he counted into the jockeys hand

  thats correct sleazy said with an
inward sigh of relief then for want
of something better to remark he
added you had the money handy i
see

  there is nothing like having ready
money orms responded big bar-
gains come unexpectedly i find

  that is true in this case at any
rate the jeweler laughed im sorry
mr weston you didnt come to see me
first

  if i had two bricks instead of one
i would have sleazy said positively
i am obliged to you mr locke and
i want you to take this for your trou-
ble and he gave the jeweler two
twenty-dollar bills

  locke thanked him and after a few
moments of desultory conversation
orms replaced the brick and closed the
vault door when they had come out
of doors the jeweler said good night
and went home returning to the hotel
with orms the jockey went to his room
at once

  oh boy he exclaimed throwing
himself in a chair and greyson calls
that kind of work finesse poor bob
i judge he must be up against the

cushion i wonder now-i think ill
tip him off at that to-morrow ill be
ahead of the game no matter how things
break the horses name is swallow

v

  sleazy attended the opening of the
fair with free mind riding to the
grounds with orms as the hotel man
was one of the officials he was privi-
leged to go to the judges stand ac-
cordingly the jockey left him just inside
the gate recalling experiences of for-
mer days when he worked just such
assemblages in devious wavs from
shillaberin for other shows to op-
erating games of chance of his own at
which the chance was taken by the
players alone he threaded his way with
an interest that surprised himself
through the crowd

  the horses were now scoring for the
first race making his way toward the
grand stand sleazy encountered grey-
son in the company of eph bliss at
the gate with fingers on the lapel of
his coat the malmarte signal he passed
the time of day with them greyson
allowing bliss to pass with the crowd
through the gate stopped a moment

  what is it billy  he asked anxi-
ously

  watch your step bob the jockey
counseled orfiis is suspicious of you
and bliss is his man swallow is the
name of the horse you were going to
give him but didnt bliss is coming
back now so long

  thanks billy greyson said grate-
fully then he joined bliss

  i thought you got lost in the crowd
and was coming back to hunt you up
bliss remarked

  it isnt that eph i just happened
to recall that i promised to give mr
orms a winner on to-days card
where can i find him 

  in the judges stand want me to
deliver a message for you

  i wish you would greyson got
out his pencil and scribbled a note
here he said take this to him if
you dont mind


the pcpuljcr magazine

  out of greysons sight bliss read
the note it said 

  swallow is the name of my friends horse
he should win sure

  hm that is certainly curious

bliss muttered with a puzzled frown

  when bliss came to the stand orms

was wratching the horses round the far

turn of the track with his glasses bliss

called to him and tossed up the paper

if there is any answer jeff ill wait

here for it bliss said

  glancing at the note orms uttered

an exclamation of surprise he stood

in thought for a moment then called

down to bliss

  find sam doak the constable for

me at once and tell him to come here

  there was a note of alarm in orms

voice that gave speed to bliss legs

as soon as bliss had departed orms

stepped to the telephone booth and

called the bank the cashier answered

  hello jones orms said this is

orms speaking get that cube of gold

out of my box at once and express

it insured for twenty thousand dollars

to the assay office in new york i

want a valuation placed on it dont

let bill harney know of it under any

circumstances and send it at once it

is very important

  all right mr orms the cashier

returned ill get it off on the four-

forty-seven this afternoon ill take it

to the station myself

  as orms came from the booth doak

the constable was coming up the stairs

the hotel man drew him aside and

asked

  sam do you know this weston wrho
is stopping at the palatial

  by sight jeff he is that friend
of bill harneys isnt he

  that is the fellow he is here on
the grounds some place have some
one watch him continually until i tell
you to stop if he attempts to leave
fairlawn arrest him at once but dont
use eph bliss he is working for me
you understand

  yes but law is law mr orms
doaks said doubtfully what charge
shall i arrest him on if it becomes
necessary what has he done

  never mind that sam if he at-
tempts to leave towrn have the man
who is guarding him pick a fight with
weston and throw them both in the
lockup i shall square it with you and
your man later

  all right mr orms laughed the
constable but that is a new way for
holding a man on me how did you
happen to think of that

ill tell you some other time savn
get on the job now like a good fellow
and keep a still tongue in your head
just as you say mr orms ill
sick happy flith on him

  you couldnt pick a better man
orms returned taking up his glasses
again

  observing that the first heat of the
free-for-all race was about to be called
sleazy repaired to the back of the
grand stand where pools on the races
were being sold he paused at the
outskirts of the crowd until he heard
swallows name called making his
way through the press he heard some
one at his elbow bidding on swallow
and turned to see the speed boy mills
a hint was enough for the jockey he
bought swallow freely the horses
price was constantly receding grey-
son and eph bliss were wagering also

  when mills turned to go out the
jockey followed him

  who gave you this horse frank
and what do you know about him 
sleazy asked

  the driver billy he has been
rooming with me for the past week
over the livery stable swallow is
in who do you suppose owns him
sleazy shook his head from side to
side

  jeff orms really but he is entered
under the drivers name hey wait a
moment where are you going billy 

i want to tell-

  to some secluded bosky dell
frank if i can find one my head
has gone hot and my feet cold i must
think and sleazy hurried away to
throw himself full length on the sward
at the uttermost bounds on the grounds
the sun was hot so presentlyhe moved
to the shade of a tree and drawing
the gift bejcrecrs



his hat well down over his eyes he
gave himself up to serious reflection

  he had given greyson the horse
swallow and greyson of course had
passed the tip along to the owner
orms hence orms would connect
him with greyson and orms suspected
greyson now he recalled that he had
not approved of orms eye from the
first a nervous shiver ran over his
frame he was a boob to have come
to fairlawn on any such mission in the
first place when he didnt need the
money what should he do why
get out ef town at once of course
lets see what would jeff do have
the brick tested again of course and

in the meantime-

  taking it easy weston

  his train of thoughts thus broken
the jockey raised his head to see in
front of him a broad-shouldered thick-
chested fellow with a pugnacious face
whom he had observed from time to
time during the past few days in the
company of  the fairlawn constable
eying him narrowly sleazy said in a
querulous way

  i got tired of the crowd and came
here-to be alone

  the crowd bores me too the fel-
low responded so i guess ill keep
you company

  there is a bigger and more shady
tree yonder the jockey remarked
pointedly

  i like this one better weston
then you can have it ill go to
the other

now that i look again the other
is nicer the fellow declared evenly

  please yourself this is a free coun-
try

  i heard a judge say that once but
he said some people seemed to con-
found liberty with license did you
ever-make that mistake weston
not that i remember now do you
recall that i ever did 

  no the other answered hesitat-
ingly its just that you might i guess
as far as i am concerned everything
will be all right as long as you stick
around

  the jockey laughed elatedly

  do you know bill-i always call
every one i like bill--i always did say
you were a fine fellow which do you
smoke-cigs or cigars  i carry both
cigs hello there is swallow four
lengths ahead on the stretch turn he
lost the first heat but i guess he will
win this one and the race

  ive got a bet on him and i hope
so but how does that answer come
to you

  i saw you and mr greyson and a
few more strangers betting on him-
and then eph bliss that made a
quorum spell wise johnny and go
the head of the class drawled bill

  i get you bill but why eph
bliss

  jeff orms is on the judges stand
so he cant bet himself

  sleazy arose and patted bill on the
shoulders with a laugh

  i believe you are right he said
jeff gave me the tip on swallow him-
self jeff likes me bill

  i know that so much in fact that
he is uneasy when you are out of his
sight weston

  im commencing to feel the same
way about you bill have you been
up for the draft yet no then when
you do i hope you pass a fine physical
examination

  thanks offered bill dryly and
nowt that i know you like me so much
ill stay with you till the cows come
home

  in my part of the country those
animals go to roost at sundown the
jockey observed meaningly is it the
same here 

  scarcely that was a way of speak-
ing on my part like the tender the law-
yer made you on the steps of the pala-
tial shall we go now weston we
will cash in on those swallow bets i
can use the money thats coming to me
you never need to be short when
im in town bill the jockey said sig-
nificantly ill loan you any amount
you say right now

  bill laughed and replied

  not now weston maybe later on
orms has had his glasses on us for
the last ten minutes


the cpocpullr magazine

  any time you say sleazy asserted
then passing his arm through  bills
they wandered about the rest of the
afternoon like bosom pals

  after a late supper at the palatial
sleazy wishing to be alone went to his
room for a long time ill at ease he
smoked one cigarette a-fter another
finally he threw himself on the bed
only to toss and turn in succession
he heard the clock in the hall strike
eleven-twelve-and one with an im-
precation he sprang to his feet and
rolled up his window curtain directly
underneath in the flare of an arc light
was bill the jockey cupped his hands
around his mouth and called down in a
hoarse whisper

  its one oclock bill time for all
decent citizens to be in bed

  i am going directly weston bills
vcice floated back i was afraid you
might walk in your sleep but now that
i know you are awake im going home
ill see you in the morning so long
and turning on his heel he walked
away

  sleazy noticed now that the rope to
be used in the event of fire was gone
from his room with a start he drew
a chair softly to the door and stealth-
ily he opened the transom peering
out he saw eph bliss easing himself
into an armchair at the end of the cor-
ridor he watched him for a time
bliss with an alert look was gazing
straight down the hall the jockey got
down silently and flung out his arms
with a despairing gesture

  kismet he jerked out i dont
know what that is but they always say
it in circumstances like these at the
end of the third act

  on the two following days sleazy
and bill saw the sights of the fair to-
gether and bill saw his friend safely
to bed each night on friday morn-
ing however the last day of the fes-
tivities bill did not report for duty
and sleazy became perturbed he put
out a few guarded inquiries as to bills
whereabouts but to no purpose no
one had seen him

  fearing a trap of some sort the
jockey determined to go to the fair

grounds as usual numerous hacks
many of them pressed into service for
the occasion were circling about in
front of the palatial soliciting cus-
tomers for the down trip the jockey
climbed into the front seat of the first
one that passed the driver was bill
harney

  whats your tax down bill
sleazy demanded pulling a handful of
change from his pocket

  ten cents said harney shortly
pay when you get out

  if its all the same ill pay now
bill by the time i get down judge
holt is liable to meet me with a paper
or two having seals as big as bock-
beer signs for the purpose of fasten-
ing a mechanics lien or something on
my watch and stickpin

  suit yourself said harney taking
the coin

  that is better than being suited
lawyers are expensive

  i got mine on speculation said
harney dryly he gets his fee out
of the proceeds of the suit

  ha ha  laughed the jockey im
glad to know that i never liked him
from the first

  harney spat over the dashboard
viciously and returned

  have no fear holt will win
when i laugh ha ha bill that
means hope when i want to express
fear i cackle ho ho  

  harney thought over this a while
and replied threateningly

  if that brick is moved you are liable
to get into a lot of trouble

  many a true word is said in jest
bill sleazy remarked sadly hello
here we are so soon how fast the
time flies in pleasant conversation
let me out here bill i see a fellow
i know and hopping blithely to the
earth sleazy hastened to join his erst-
while guardian bill

  the latter mustered a rueful smile
as the jockey approached sleazy
gazed at him with an interrogative lift
of his eyebrows and said

  ha thou recreant one  wthere hast
thou been 

  dont joke weston bill returned
the gift beicrecrs



soberly i came down here early to
see the sheriff i stalled it off as long
as i could but it had to come then
he shook his head in sorrow from side
to side

  you were decent enough at any
rate bill sleazy managed to say
when does it come off
to-morrow at ten a m-unless he
said slowly a certain sum of money
is forthcoming in the meantime
how much bill

   three hundred will do

   here is the money

   thanks weston ill go see the
wife now she will be relieved we
have lived there a long time now
you were saying asked sleazy
puzzled

   that we were having trouble about
the mortgage on our place its all right
now however and im so grateful to
you for this loan weston that im
not going to bother you any more
completely mystified sleazy ran over
the situation nor could he come to
any satisfactory conclusion he knew
that in effect the money he had just
given the other was a bribe he had
read that from bills demeanor was
bill acting in good faith toward him 
he would see

   that is very nice of you bill
good-by he said extending his hand

   bill grasped it warmly then with
a sly smile he walked away when
he had gone some distance he paused
to say to himself why did sam
-toak call me off i wonder whats
rt all about anyway  i was a fathead
not to have touched weston for a cou-
ple of hundred more he would have
stood for that easily

   as sleazy stood looking after bill
 eph bliss happened to pass by sleazy
 hailed him who is that fellow eph
 who is standing with his back to us 
 asked the jockey indicating his former
 companion

  thats happy flith weston he
came to town a long time ago with jeff
orms bliss laughed he is called
happy because he has such a nice
disposition then bliss resumed his
journey

  happy eh threw out sleazy
anybody who can pick up money as
easily as flith ought to be happy
well apparently he was free for the
present he shrugged his shoulders
taught by long experience to take good
or bad fortune as it came he refused
to borrow trouble so he purchased
a ticket and entered the fair grounds

  once inside he was worming his
way through the crowd when he heard
some one calling weston it was
jeff orms seated behind his driving
horse

  get in the hotel man said heart-
ily and come along to the judges
stand with me the foot race will be
run in a few minutes i think the run-
ners will show us some fast time

  nothing loath sleazy accepted the
invitation when they arrived at the
judges stand it seemed to sleazy that
all the people in the grounds were
packed around the finish the grand
stand wras so filled with spectators that
standing room was at a premium and
the overflow crowd had pushed out on
the track to gather in sweltering masses
at each side

  the hotel man and sleazy passed up
the stairs to join the officials these
were grouped at the railing talking to-
gether desultorily and watching the
runners limber out in front attend-
ants were placing into position a series
of ropes to afford separate lanes for
each runner this was a matter of
surprise to the jockey as such arrange-
ments were usually reserved for im-
portant athletic meets he divined at
once that some one was taking pre-
cautions against fouling and pocketing

  directly across from him at the fin-
ish line sleazy observed greyson talk-
ing with the two cohens greyson
catching his eye smiled reassuringly
the cohens sleazy thought had gone
rather white in the face and he won-
dered which way greyson had ribbed
them on the coming race he felt that
they were interested in some manner

  the gong over his head pealed and
the runners came to the stand to draw
for positions as they approached he
marked mills wirth and the fellow


the popular magazine

sparks the others he had not seen
before as zittel breezed down sleazy
caught his breath a real runner and
a speed boy if i am any judge he
said to himself i wonder what he
is doing here  i have seen him some
place before i am certain

  as the runners were ordered to re-
port to the starter orms remarked to
sleazy

  a likely looking bunch weston
  very which one do you favor
  i rather favor sparks	seems

a good-natured sort of fellow and
sleazy suddenly recalled the meeting
under his window of orms with sparks
and mary the waitress

  at the fifty-yard mark mills and
sparks were running neck and neck
zittel was a yard behind and the rest
of the field straggled out in the rear
approaching the tape zittel threw an
eye over his shoulder to call a warning
shout to mills he was too late how-
ever although mills redoubled his
efforts sparks beat him to the tape by
a step and keeping on disappeared in
the crowd beyond

  ten seconds flat nice running in-
deed said orms in sleazys ear then
he cried hello mr greyson over
there seems thunderstruck at the re-
sult  he wagered freely on wirth or
possibly austin

  a fool and his money are easily
parted said sleazy evenly mr
greyson should have stuck by his live
stock

  he was said orms sententiously
was what mr orms askedthe
jockey innocently

  stuck by his live stock the hotel
man said with a laugh well the fair
is over let us get back to the pala-
tial i presume you will be leaving
us shortly 

  to-night said sleazy chancing it
i shall see you thn before you
go orms said casually and the jockey
breathed a sigh of relief

  afterthe finish of the race greyson
and the cohens looked at one another
in dumb stupefaction finally grey-
son managed to say

   we lost boys we have been ribbed
 good and plenty

   not boys  snapped ike looking
 after him infants in arms ve was
 morris

   sleazy and orms in the meantime
 were getting into the hotel mans car-
 riage tied alongside wras another
 horse hitched to a buggy sleazy
 glanced at this to see sparks and mary
 the waitress seated therein mary had
 her arm around the runners neck the
 jockey nudged orms and remarked

   the last time i saw those two in a
 carriage they were keeping rather late
 hours

   nobody has a better right they
 are married orms answered

   tlin it seems to me that a fellow
 having all the money sparks got for
 his stone land should be able to support
 his wife sleazy said

   orms gave him a fleeting wink as
 he replied

   that land wras supposed to be sold
 -supposed i said weston-the day
 after the speed boy austin blew into
 fairlawn at any rate they will have
 money enough to start housekeeping
 now- i shall see to that

   sleazy understood and laughed nor
 did he wonder at the use of the word
 speed boy and yet it wfas to this
 man he had sold his gold brick i
 guess i must be a smarter guy than i
 thought he said to himself

   the nine-thirty train outbound from
 fairlawn was at the station sleazy
 and greyson wrere occupying the same
 seat and the adjoining one faced to-
 ward them contained the speed boys
 mills and zittel owing to the un-
 wonted number of passengers extra
 cars were being attached and there was
  a considerable delay

   jeff orms coming along the station
 platform espied sleazy through the
 open window and stopped to shake
 hands

   do you knowt weston he said
 i got suspicious of you and your gold
 brick when greyson gave me the name
 of my own horse swallowr as winner
 of the free-for-all for i knew you must
the gift befltrecrs



have told him i want to apologize for
my seeming distrust i however even
sent your brick on for assay to new
york of course the report came back
that it was all right and worth exactly
what you said-twenty thousand dol-
lars

  whats that exclaimed sleazy and
greyson as one man

  pure gold of- hello you there

too greyson he broke off looking in
the window and as i live there
are austin and zittel the speed boys
well well all together eh 

  at the sound of orms voice zittel
bent forward in his seat and thrust his
head through the window after a mo-
ment he said

  i thought i knew that voice  hello
fixer dont you remember me
sure i do now zittel i couldnt
place you though when i saw you and
austin showing greyson your speed
outside the town lets see zittel you
were with me and the old g  j bunch
werent you  how is the graft zit-
tel 

  punk fixer  zittel responded and
the train pulled out

  who the devil is this fellow zit-
tel  demanded sleazy

  his name is wiggins he used to
be the fixer for us when i followed
the old g  j circus the first year i
was out and a first-class man he was
too he dropped out years ago and
nobody knew what became of him
well ill be honus-wagnered
ejaculated sleazy whats the mat-
ter bob  easy man easy dont
so hard take it

  the brick  gasped greyson si-
lents brick all gold you remember
billy i told you he went out the day
he died with twenty thousand dollars
and it was gone when he returned
what a dolt i was he turned the
money into the brick and then wanted
me to get it into his brothers hands
so that his brother would believe he
wras on the level and i didnt and
ive been broke a hundred times since
and had all that gold in my trunk
then he burst into laughter that had
something hysterical in it

  i see how it is laughed sleazy in
great good humor if that brick
didnt happen to be gold id be in jail
now as it is im out and happy and
in ten thousand dollars on it fine
you blooming jackass you lucky
stiff hissed greyson of course in
our settlement i get credit for ten
thousand dollars that brick was
mine you know

  of course-not greyson the
jockey lisped you traded me the
brick for getting you mills the speed
boy there right greyson 

  greyson nodded his head in assent
now about those bets bob i see
you have a pencil there in your pocket
get it out like a good fellow and go
to work as for me i can figure out
what i owe you in my head it is
nothing

  so greyson drewt the following ac-
count 

won

from the cohen brothers on zittel 
from the cohen brothers  poker

game  

 total 

lost

bet to sleazy that he couldnt sell

 brick 

bet to sleazy that i could sell foot

money paid to mills and zittel 

money owed to mills and zittel 

 total 

 out 

  isnt it wonderful greyson ex-
claimed what bullhead luck will do

sometimes now here----

  meaning me i suppose bob the
jockey laughed but then you know
a blind pig will garner an acorn once
in a while

  that is just it i fancy then
greyson muttered half aloud

   gift bearers all

  i dont make that said sleazy it
was brother went to night school not
me however if you are trying to say
that fixer wiggins has ribbed us to
a fare-you-well i guess youre aboard
of the right hoss

right billy said greyson sadly
tears and temperament

by ellis parker butler
author of  up liberty hily etc

like a spoiled baby the wife herein gets everything she wants by crying for it and
each of her weeps was more ambitious than the last her husband could do nothing
except give in but an irish politician of the good old school proved equal to the task

for the first four years of her
married life mrs targrove was
normal enough to cause allyn
targrove little annoyance she
had her occasional periods of weeps
when she shut herself in her room and
shed tears as a fountain sheds water
but these were occasioned by such
things as a gown that should have
turned out well but did not or a cook
who should have been a daughter of
temperance but was a maudlin patron
of the products of the whisky trust sit-
ting in the middle of the kitchen floor
and whetting a murderous butcher
knife on the sole of her shoe little
things like these upset young house-
keepers so allyn would kiss his poor
anna feel sorry for her and pet her
the more she still loved allyn with
young love and her selfish egotism had
not reached full growth

  the pettings she got during those
early years helped to spoil her no
doubt and in her fifth married year
she began to have weeps because of
allyn he was-and all honor to him
for it-grave and sedate he had the
targrove family history to live up to
and the targrove family millions to
conserve in honor

  many said he looked more like a pro-
fessor than a business man but that
was stating it loosely and the word was
used because allyn targrove was the
only old-family man of wealth in river-
bank what he looked like was an
old-family man of wealth his theory
of what his own life should be- may
be set down thus to live with
honor to avoid diminishing the luster

                          

of the targrove name to die highly
respected he was a thoughtful man
who had never had occasion to think

  in riverbank whatever we might
think of other men we thought noble
things of allyn targrove to use a
golf term-quite unknown in river-
bank then-he never pressed he
was far and away the most powerful
man in riverbank employing more la-
bor paying more wagesr sitting on
more boards of directors than any other
man and owning more of the towns
vitals but he never used his power
he was an example of comely re-
straint even when it came to charitable
giving his name was always well
down toward the middle of the lists
as if to prove that in all things where
a targrove sat was the head of the
table

  for these reasons of character
annas weeps annoyed allyn tar-
grove exceedingly he felt they were
not right he never refused her the
money for the best hat in riverbank
nor when she advanced in knowing-
ness the best hat in chicago he was
calm when she wanted the best five hats
in chicago and he let her have them
but when she wanted the twenty most
expensive hats in chicago or-having
got them and feeling a slight dissatis-
faction with them-jerked them from
their twenty boxes and tore them to
shreds with stifled shrieks of anger
he was apt to raise his eyebrows in
surprise then she would throw her-
self on the bed and weep and accuse
him of wanton cruelty

  in a vague way he felt that the ac-
tears and temperament



cusation was unjust he never went
quite as far as saying so being a gen-
tleman and a targrove but he would
go so far as to say if i were you
anna dear i would try to be calmer
naturally enough this made her furi-
ous it would make any woman furi-
ous-any woman like anna targrove
it would make any tears-and-tempera-
ment woman furious justly so

  allyn targrove bore the tears and
temperament with stoic fortitude
after all anna was a targrove by
marriage of course but there wras an
unwritten law  once a targrove and
however a targrove always a tar-
grove  it is delightful to see these
little charming traits of the life of
english nobility rooted in our-taw soil
the trouble however must have been
that anna was by nature plebeian she
lacked the excellent aristocratic qual-
ity of circumambulation that going
around in circles to an eternally same
beginning that alone makes aristocracy
possible she retained the democratic
instinct for progress with her one
thing had to lead to another and al-
though allyn discharged pat hogan
who had been a boy on the targrove
place and was now a young man there
and knew every hair in the coats of
the targrove horses anna was not sat-
isfied she made allyn have the tar-
grove oak cut down and allyn was
forced by the harmlessness of the oak
to conclude that the only reason she
wanted the fine old tree felled was that
he did not want it felled but down
it went

  down went the old oak because
anna in her progress had passed from
the weeps to what pat hogan would
have called high strikes it was re-
ported in riverbank that her hysterics
were something awful my dear and
so they were shrieks then she
would tear her waist from her bosom
and throw herself on the floor and
kick the floor in a most un-targrove
style of frenzy and she would
shriek and kick until allyn said you
may have it my dear you may have
it  no matter what the thing was

above all a targrove must avoid scan-
dal

  above all this teary temperamental
lady dreaded scandal herself she was
if i may say so like a good old family
musket by nature she was an ex-
ploder had she not been a targrove
she would have been a splendid town
trouble maker making scandal for her-
self being a targrove and having to
explode she exploded from the wrong
end of the musket and peppered allyn
full of the powder of distress

 by the time they were married
twenty years she had allyn well under
control and was making good use of
the control pat hogan said something
quite near the truth when he said
shes a she-divil but i could turn
her into an angel that would eat out
of me hand pat would have listened
to her one minute and then he would
have used one blow of kis fist having
felled her he would i am sorry to say
have kicked her in the end she would
have been a reasonable creature or a
corpse understand please that i do
not approve his method i am merely
mentioning it because after twenty
years of weeps and high strikes it
was pat hogan cured her

  give me a german philosopher for
dissecting the human-what is the word
i want-and putting it on wonderful
but quite useless charts but give me
the irishman for going direct to the
vital root of a matter it is to be con-
sidered of course that pat hogan re-
tained some resentment from being dis-
charged on a whim not that he was
not all the better for having been dis-
charged if ever a man was driven to
fame and fortune pat hogan was-
and to fatness too-foe by the time
anna targrove was forty-five pat was
forty-three and a fat outspoken well-
to-do general contractor getting his full
share of anything the city had to give
in the way of contracts and seeing
the right aldermen every time he had
a twinkle in his eye and he was the
honestest man in riverbank barring the
grafting which was admittedly a cus-
tom of the country

  it was a pleasure to do business with


the popular magazine

pat hogan either as an alderman a
day laborer a fellow politician or in
mere business his word was good
of course he was a democrat-any
irishman not a democrat being as rare
as the great auk--but he did not claim
to control his party he was just wan
iv thim but he was a decidedly
powerful wan iv thim and there was
never a conference that pat hogan
was not asked to

  the greenbackers did not have to
be reckoned with in elections because
they were a withering shrub the
deriiocrats and the republicans split
things nicely it being understood that
the one should have the city and the
other the county and the two solid
little rings understood each other and
worked together like dovetailed edges
the big men of the democrats-mur-
phy flannahan pat hogan doolitig
and carter-would wink an eye when
they spoke of those republican rascals
hentz buddmeyer wright lawyer
martin and val pierce they played
the game of politics according to their
lights and were happy and well fed
it was a nice little family party

  when the cards of the game had
been dealt ten times or so with the
ace of state senatorship falling to
hentz each time it was conceded that
hentz was the political big light of the
district he was so accepted before
each election there were violently par-
tisan primaries tickets were nominated
on both sides campaign money col-
lected and partly spent on the elec-
tions and the voters worked themselves
into frenzies hardly less hysterical than
mrs targroves

  every one was always in doubt re-
garding the result of the election--ex-
cept the ten big men men sat up until
after midnight to get the final returns
and-oddly enough-the democrats al-
ways carried the town and the repub-
licans always carried the count and
hentz went back to the state senate
unless some democratic candidate
offended murphy or flannahan or pat
hogan or dooling or carter then
some republican miraculously ran
ahead of his ticket the same with

the republican candidates the way
to run a part is to run it

  by the time -anna targrove was
forty-five she had quite forgotten the
existence of pat hogan but it was
pat gave allyn targrove five full
years of freedom from tears and tem-
perament

  well i dont see why i cant
anna targrove said you couldnt
-not alone-but if you ever showed
the least willingness to please me in
any way whatever you would be state
senator and then governor and then
real senator

  my dear said allyn gently but
with cold fear in his heart i have

never cared to go into politics-

  no you never cared and thats
all you care wrhat i want doesnt
matter to you little you care what

- and i only ask you to-- oh

i wish i had married a man oh i
wish i had my life to live over again

im so-im so-

  she began to weep wiping her eyes
with her lace-edged handkerchief and
crying oh suddenly as she put her
hands to her temples and began walk-
ing the floor

  allyn watched her sadly as she
walked up and down going through the
working-up stages of her temperamen-
tal orgy and she stopped before him
her words coming in torrents until she
grasped the waist of her dress and tore
it to shreds and grasped the hair of
her head and tore out handfuls until
she looked like a fury and readied her
climax by throwing herself face down-
ward on the floor screaming and beat-
ing the floor with the toes of her boots
anna  he said sternly

  then she beat her forehead on he
floor she had never done that before
and it frightened him the floor was
carpeted but she dug her nails into the
carpet and pounded the floor with her
head shrieking all the while her head
hit her hand covered with a doen glit-
tering rings and the blood ran from the
cut she stopped and glared insanely
up at allyn her breath coming in great
gasps and her whole body trembling
she was hideous-too hideous to look
tears and temperament

 

upon-and he turned his face away
hiding his eyes with his hands

  stop he cried anna stop ill
do what you want 

  she collapsed or seemed to with
her cheek to the carpet with dry sobs
and spasmodic tremblings and he raised
her and helped her to the bed

  oh allyn if only when i want
things--

  yes yes dear ill do what you
want ill see murphy to-morrow-

  to-day allyn

  yes yes dear ill see him to-
day

  send nettie to me she said smil-
ing weakly my forehead-is it very
bad allyn if only i could control
myself  i am all nerves allyn i dont
know what i am doing when i act so

something i cant control- you

are so good-i-send me nettie allyn
please

  it is one of the miracles of man that
he bent over her and kissed her and
begged her to take a long rest and a
bromide as soon as he was out of
the room she slipped from the bed and
examined her face minutely in her mir-
ror feeling the small cut gently she
ran a forefinger across one eyebrow
which was a little dusty and then
viewed herself again at a somewhat
greater distance from the mirror

  a senators wife she smiled and
then found a silken dressing robe and
drew it on and arranged herself com-
fortably on the bed to await netties
coming it was quite the greatest bat-
tle she had won-this forcing a tar-
grove into politics

  when allyn targrove found mur-
phy-which he did by sending one of
his clerks for him-murphy came to
the targrove office

  well mr targrove and what can
we do for ye  he asked taking a chair
without being asked

  sit down murphy said allyn as
if to indicate that men did not usually
sit in his presence without being asked
to do so murphy i have been think-
ing over conditions in this town county
and district and i dont approve of all
i see

  it was not annas husband speaking
it was the great man the fine citizen
the man of power

  im with ye there mr targrove
said murphy heartily but with his
small piglike eyes viewing allyn un-
easily  the way them republicans
are lootin th county treasry is out-
rageous im-

  just so said targrove one
thing and another is far from sweet
murphy i have decided to go into poli-
tics i mean to succeed hentz as state
senator

  do ye now  said murphy for all
the surprise he showed he might have
been expecting this for years well
yell make a good senator mr tar-
grove it will cost some money but
thatll not be bothering you im think-
in of course its as a democrat youll
be running of course

  he was thinking rapidly for he did
not like this idea he knew allyn tar-
grove  all riverbank knew allyn tar-
grove this man targrove if he went
into politics-if he went into anything
-would be big he would be big he
would be worse than big because he
was so innocently big he was the
sort of man who would expect to be
big because of his family record his
wealth and his self for a season he
would be at sea on strange wtaters of
course and things could be so managed
that hentz would beat him for the sen-
atorship this year but there would be
another term and another term and still
other terms once in politics this soft-
handed targrove would be something
to be dealt with and it was an infernal
nuisance when all the combinations
were so nicely arranged and wrorking
so pleasantly

  it can be arranged said murphy
again musingly oh yes and a
splendid thing for the cmunity twill
be to have a man like you mr tar-
grove takin an intrest in things the

campaign fund-

  in all such matters i shall be liberal
i understand some things you may
think i do not politics is a practical
matter i understand that

  curse ye ill bet ye do thought


the popular magazine

murphy aloud he said im heart-
ily glad ye are cornin into th game
giving- intentionally the impression that
money did count for something after
all with murphy youll want me
to manage a bit for ye  of course
i know well ye did not ask me here
for nothin there are four we cannot
do without-pat hogan flannahan
dooling and carter they have th
party in their pockets as ye might say
a conference now as if ye had said
nothin to me ye understand

 at my home said targrove
promptly you could manage it for
this evening

  i was thinkin of the room back of
jerry timms saloon said murphy
with a shade of reluctance we come
together there most times

  at my home said mr targrove
firmly at eight-thirty thank you 
he gave murphy his hand murphy
sought out pat hogan at once and to
him expressed his curseful opinion of
targrove it was all up with the sweet
way things had been going he said with

proper profanity and-

  dont fret do not fret ye mur-
phy urged pat hogan  tis day-
light til the sun goes down as me
ould mother was always sayin

  but dang ye hes big said mur-
phy may the grave gulp me if hes
not big enough to be bigger than all
of us and swallow us and do for us
and he is all of that too agreed
pat hogan

  he is a mighty man said murphy
we are like children beside him
agreed pat hogan

  theyll flock to him theyll go
mad over him hell flip us away like
a grain of wheat from his thumb
saint tweed of new yorruk what a
boss hell be 

  even worse than all that agreed
pat hogan

  so whats to be done paddy 
nawthin said pat hogan not
a dang thing not a dang thing until
i get me wits about me confer as
he bids us

  me and you flannahan dooling
and carter-

  and not carter said pat hogan
ill have no more to do with that man
carter - hes a liar and ye know it
hes a cheat and ye are aware of it
five hundred dollars orourke gave
him to buy votes with last aldermanic
election and he spent no more than
two hundred th thief hes not wor-
thy the name of honest citizen ill
have no carter 

  omit carter said murphy sooth-
insly-

  then i will confer said pat
hogan

  and confer he did the four big
men ojt the democratic party met at
mr targroves gate and went in to-
gether anna targrove was in a gown
that had never suffered from tears and
temperament and she had-knowing
the political stomach-set the dining-
room table with beer and sandwiches in
plenty she received the big men in
the parlor and led them into the li-
brary she was beautiful and she was
keyed high because these were the men
who would lead her to des moines and
to washington she was effusive to
mr murphy like a dear sister to mr
dooling and like a first cousin to mr
flannahan pat hogan twenty years
older than when he was last in the
house wandered around the room tak-
ing note of the changes he paused
before the revolving bookcase in the
center of the room

  this is a new jug yeve got here
maam he said

  priceless breathed anna tar-
grove taking the vase from the top of
the revolving case and turning it in
her hand peachblow mr hogan
the most prized of my possessions i
saw it at the exposition and loved it
but it was so very expensive mr tar-
grove let me have it most reluctantly
ill bet ye clawed the floor and
yelled like an indian to get it pat
hogan said to himself its a pretty
toy he said to her carelessly i dare
say ye strove hard t keep yer husband
out of the dirty pot of-politics maam
i urged him to do his part in the
government of his state she said
sweetly and pat hogan knew what that
teaks an temperament



meant yelped like a coyote ill war-
rant  he said to himself

  the conference lasted two hours
mrs targrove sitting in the library
while the men sat at the table it de-
veloped into a most serious affair

  well and good then said murphy
as he arose from the table well con-
fer again this night week and arrange
the preliminaries with ye mr tar-
grove and so it was about to be
agreed when pat hogan interrupted

  with hentz and his gang of thiev-
ing black republicans added unto us
he threw in

  and what th divil do we want-

murphy began angrily

  if we could persuade hentz to re-
tire on his laurels mind ye murphy
said pat hogan and murphy caught
his wink

  right he said for he was astute
well have the big five here with us
to-night a week good night t ye
senator

  mr targrove smiled

thank you-i hope so he said
and anna went with them to the door

 now what th divil hogan-

murphy began when they were out-
side and the door was closed

  like a lot of scared school children
ye were said hogan disdainfully
were ye frightened of th plush por-
tieres or what murphy twas as good
as a dollar show t see ye tryin t stick
our yer little pinky finger whilst ye
was drinkin th beer a swell lot of
high-society gintlemin yell all be after
ye have associated with th aristocracy
a bit more not wan of ye spat on
th carpet a man would think ye had
never learned barroom manners at all
no nonsense ordered murphy
shut up pat tis more serious even
than i feared hes a big big man
he is so grinned hogan but th
biggest man in th wurrld needs only
a few more spades of earth to bury
him ill be askin val pierce-the
republican hog-t th conference
youll be attendin to th rest

  it was so agreed the news that
allyn targrove wras going into politics
gave the republican five no less con-
b p

sternation than it had given the demo-
cratic big men they were all flabber-
gasted they were lost dethroned
done for and they knew it

  allyn targrove was not exactly
happy himself he felt soiled like a
man who has journeyed three days and
three nights on a soft-coal railroad
but there was anna she had never
been happier never more affectionate
but the tears and temperament were
just beneath the eager glitter of her
eyes every moment and she watched
allyn closely she was ready at the
slightest step backward on his part to
beat her forehead against the uncar-
peted floor of the upper hall

  oh mrs targrove politics is
such a dirty business im that sorry
mr targrove is going into it said
nettie playing ignorance of the knowl-
edge that mrs targrove had wept and
screamed her husband into it if you
knew  they tell me such things 

  nonsense nettie said anna
with low men yes mr targrove
will not need to come in contact with
the rough element im sure

  the whole business is a rough ele-
ment maam ventured nettie because
pat plogan had told her to so venture
dirty saloon-haunting drinking fel-
lows-and you cant get on ydthout
them

  mr targrove will be able to i
think said anna he will raise the
tone i shall have a little to say per-
haps

  she meant she would have a great
deal to say as it turned out she did
not say a great deal after all the
next conference began auspiciously
the beer was opened early and the
ten men around the table including
mr targrove-for mr carter was not
there-bent their heads together and
talked straight politics mr hentz
state senator for many terms good-
naturedly declined to refuse renomina-
tion and smoked one of mr tar-
groves good cigars both these things
had been expected

  at that ye may beat us out this
first election hentz agreed murphy

  we will murph said val pierce


the popular magazine

he was a lank wiry man he had
been sheriff of the county six times
he looked consumptive because of the
high color whisky gave his cheek bones
and because of the stoop in his shoul-
ders he was in fact muscle and
wire with lungs like an ox he had
an ugly scar over one eye and was
not now sheriff having been tempo-
rarily dropped from the running be-
cause of a brawl for which he had not
been indicted for murder only because
he was one of the five big ones of the
republican party in riverbank county
youre dam right well win he re-
iterated

  hish  theres a lady in th libry
cautioned pat hogan

  i did not put her there said val
iierce roughly them that dont like
my talk dont have to stay where theyll

hear it i say youre d--d right well

win if that liar carter dont go back
on his word

  pat hogan arose and leaned his two
fat fists on the table he glared at
val pierce and his chin protruded
like a weapon

  and that yell take back he said
with cold anger no man can call a
man a liar when he is not here and
im his friend be you pierce or the
divil take it back

  murphy opened his mouth in amaze-
ment

  ill take nothing back said val
pierce carter is a liar and born and

bred a liar-

  the beer bottle pat hogan threw
missed val pierce by an inch and went
thumping and bumping into the library
beyond spilling beer on the rugs and
floor but the miss did not matter much
for pat hogan threw himself across
the table and grasped val pierce by
the throat and struggled across the
table upsetting bottles and scattering
them to the floor then pierce shook
him loose but pat hogans fat fist
reached out and caught the republican
 the cheek and they clinched and
swearing and yowling struggled and
slipped and fell into the library

  the eight men shouted at them but
they broke apart and beat each other

brutally with cruel unpracticed fists
the blood ran from pat hogans nose
and infuriated him he was like a
mad bull charging his enemy and maul-
ing him and being mauled in turn mrs
targrove screamed she retreated out
of the mens way and they fell over
her chair and leaped up and fought
again biting and kicking she backed
against the wall her hands over her
ears she was frightened-frightened
for the first time in her selfish little
life she had reason to be frightened
for there was murder in the way the
two men fought and val pierce had
already killed his man in a similar
brawl

  it was a strange hideous thing to
have happened in a quiet aristocratic
home on willow avenue most of all
in the home of a targrove the eight
men shouted and swore and tried to
pull the two crazed fighters apart and
then swayed against the glazed book-
cases here and there sending the glass
clattering in pieces to the floor a bar-
room brawl

  push me aginst it grunted pat
hogan in val pierces ear as he pre-
tended to bite his jugular vein now 

  for the revolving bookcase and the
peachblow vase were the climax of the
fight as arranged with val pierce by
pat hogan

  mrs targroves eyes grew black
with horror as she saw them sway to-
ward the revolving case and allyn tar-
groves eyes flashed anger he uttered
an oath-a genuine barroom oath-and
jumped forward pat hogan his arm
around val pierces neck glanced back-
ward to make sure he would crash into
the revolving case and saw allyn tar-
grove coming his eyes glowed with
the light of inspiration such inspira-
tion as comes seldom to mortal man
such inspiration as poets feel when pen-
ning an immortal line and he cast val
pierce from him and lowered his head
and charged at allyn targrove as a
bull charges catching him full in the
belt with his hard head and sending
him reeling against the revolving case
which tottered swayed sent the peach-
blow vase reeling to the floor and de-
tears ant temperament



was when he opened his eyes on the
couch that he would leave politics alone
forever

ye done yer part well val said
pat hogan as the nine swung open the
door of jerrys saloon except ye for-
got t draw a knife on me like i tould
ye for an amachoor performance
twas not so bad th quarrel was well
planned an based on reasonable
grounds for theres nawthin an irish-
man resints like an attack on an absint

frind and-

he paused at the door to jerrys
back room and turned

come away from here he said dis-
gustedly well go acrost t mikes
place

whats wrong asked murphy
ill not come in yonder said pat
hogan that liar and crook of a car-
ter is there

struction and then as if it too was
in the conspiracy fell forward upon
allyn targrove of the old-family tar-
groves and quenched him temporarily
he went out with an oath

  the battle paused while they raised
the case and lifted allyn targrove can-
didate for state-senatorship honors and
clean politician and placed him on a
couch and still anna targrove stood
against the wall big-eyed and horror-
stricken she was too frightened to
move too frightened to breathe

  for five years thereafter she was too
frightened at what her tears and tem-
perament had brought about and too
fearful of the imminent danger of news
of the desecration that had threatened
the targrove home and name to so
much as ask allyn targrove for a
paper of pins except in proper wifely
meekness the only thing she asked
mysteria the mind reader

            by e albert apple

        author of  the plans of corregidor 

 from the first mysteria was a knock-out and  hung em on the
 chandeliers as the enthusiastic managers said of her drawing
 capacity-but she proved too impartial in her second sight

out through the middle west
following the harvest belt with
the shrewdness of a circus route
man came one of the original
wise men of the east marmaduke slo-
cum with a sure-fire and beautiful
graft

 marmaduke was known in every
booking office from u b o to or-
pheum time as the best ballyhoo
man freak manager illusion exploiter
and general faker in the business he
hadnt had a failure since the dime-
museum days

  one glance at marmaduke and any
vaudeville manager would crowd him
in on the bill his was a personality
and atmosphere that accompanies suc-
cess in the show business he wore
black string ties a cowboy hvat spats
and a mississippi congressmans coat
talked in headlines quoted fake sta-
tistics by the mile and had a repertoire
of three hundred as fine adjectives as
ever pulled crowd into a side show

  he sat now in the managers office
of a big-time chicago vaudeville the-
ater and swapped strange tales with his
fellow in crime

  it was a beautiful graft declared
marmaduke chuckling and slapping fat
hands on his knees my own idea
too lecture on new york the wicked-
est city in the world only took three
of us-myself to deliver the uplift lec-
ture a sniper to bill the show and an
advance man to operate between he
put his collar on backward blew into
frcgtown looked up the local pastor
im a retired divine from the south

was the line he put out just travelin
round fer my health always look up
fellow clerics i was over in kansas
city come next tuesday week saw a
wonderful thing there-lecture on
new york the wickedest city in the
world itd have a grand moral effect
if you could get it here the sniper
follows along in a few days and makes
a dicker with the revrend sunday
school to get a half of one per cent
of the gate in disguise then i come
in with a phony lecture an two hundred
lantern slides you oughta heard it
here we have a night scene from the
mulberry street police court three
days later this young girls body was
found floating in the east river her
mother a seamstress in a small wis-
consin village was notified et cetery
et cetery best thing since they started
esau with his writhing rattling rattle-
snakes

  if i were you suggested the house
manager shrewdly id take that lec-
ture right into new york theyd eat
it up

  marmaduke shook his head stub-
bornly

  too much talkin i been eatin
cough drops an throat lozenges till i
feel like a corner drug store i want
to get back in some legitimate graft-
managin a mind reader say i know
all the best codes an have some new
bunk of my own up my sleeve the
mob always falls for second-sight stuff
but i cant find the right woman went
through gypsies an street carnivals an
side-street palm readers like a red-hot
myste<RIJ3f THE MINT> rejder



cinder through a newspaper most of
em say haint an them things an
id get laughed off besides i got ideas
on this thing i want some one thatll
pass as an egyptian princess or a
hindu priestess or a seventh daughter
of a seventh daughter theres a lot
in the looks shes got to know her
grammar an walk like a head waiter
if i get the right kind i can buffalo the
audiences so annie eva fake will have
to work for three cents a month

  the house manager drummed on his
desk nervously pulled at his ear sud-
denly slapped his knee

  i know the very person you wrant
he announced with quiet jubilation
shes stage-struck been hanging
around my office for a month i tried
her out one morning she cant act she
cant sing shed look like bad news
in a sketch but shes got a voice that
makes you think of black cats and talk-
ing with the dead with green eyes as
big as overcoat buttons and wild blond
hair that shoots out albino- in every
direction like a bonfire if you dont
like the props you can keep her cov-
ered with a sheet velma the veiled
seeress thatd be a good line

  well bill her as mysteria the mind
reader approved the great marma-
duke with satisfaction the names
been on my mind for weeks your
description of this bird sounds like just
what i want

  mysteria the mind reader was a
knock-out from the first--hung em
on the chandeliers as enthusiastic
managers referred to the way she drew
business

 women went wild about her and
would have given up face powder for
the taboo private interviews there
were special ladies matinees and inves-
tigating committees from local-college
faculties or city halls

  and its well worth while to show
you how she worked-she got four
hundred and fifty dollars a week for it
maybe you can become a mind reader
yourself

  it was all done in code but a code
so elaborate and handled with aston-

ishing swiftness as wtonderful as gen-
uine second-sight work

  evening the impatient crowd has
sat restlessly through the succession of
cheap acts craftily slipped in by the

centrate mysteria shouts marma-
duke

  i dont get this clearly mysteria
hurries on picking cherries out of the
air there seems to be something
around her oh yes money  she and
her husband are about to be very for-
tunate some investment theyve al-
most forgotten but warn them against
an invention i see some one around
them some man friend who is not
just wthat you think

  the gentleman interrupts marma-
duke wants to know if hell have any
more children

  i regret to tell the gentleman that
he will have no more children-but his
wife will have five

  in the roar that follows the gentle-
man is glad to forget his other daugh-
ter and marmaduke is well up the
aisle

  ah what here

  dollar bill

  give the number

  eighty-three million seven hundred
and ninety-six thousand five hundred
and four

  is that right lady 

  the lady agrees returns the bill to
her purse and now the audience is
buzzing like a beehive marmaduke
had watched purse after purse as he
opened them having mysteria call out
handkerchiefs keys powder puff and
the like waiting for one with a dollar
bill when he found it he palmed the
bill opened up one of his own read
these many minutes and mysteria-
knowing the number-repeated it to
the complete mystification of the house

  among other stunts she described a
whole row of people in detail earlier
in the evening marmaduke had come
from back stage and standing behind
the curtains of a box looked this row
over for some ten minutes memoriz-
ing occupants for transference to mys-
teria before their act

  questions were written on paper
handed to marmaduke and transmitted
to the stage by oral code or pads
wtere passed about questions written
torn off and retained and marmaduke

 read them with the help of a carbon
 paper in the middle of the pad

  the code was the wonderful part
 of the act they had practiced three
 months steadily night and day before
 mysterias first public performance

   working fast was another essential
 -surprise mystify people then shift
 their attention to the next question in
 another part of the theater before they
 had time for analysis

   from the beginning mysteria the
 mind reader was a riot two years
 slipped by her name was a byword
 wherever newspapers were delivered
 those who hadnt seen her had talked
 with some one who had or read about
 her wonderful work dream books
 bearing her name appeared and sold
 into the hundreds of thousands the
 unending mob of superstitious open to
 easy conviction susceptible to clever
 trickery swallowed her-hook line and
 sinker

   everything would have been all right
 but marmaduke slocum-gazing at the
 conquered worlds that lay about him
 like fallen pears-grew ambitious

   the cause of marmadukes ambition
 was the discovery that his hat no longer
 covered his bald spot it was a decided
 shock-much as when a father hears
 his son refer to him as the old man
 for the first time he walked through
 nine cigarettes up in one of the fly
 galleries thinking it over now and then
 stopping to watch the sceneshifting
 and darting about of performers below

   so he was getting old  why hadnt
 he hung onto some of his money hed
 made plenty of it there was sixty-
 forty ross so named after his inex-
 orable rule for dividing net receipts
 he and ross had started together with
 barnum now ross had a big picture
 house in louisville there were scores
 of them men hed trotted with in har-
 ness frorrf time to time all well heeled
 as the sun of their declining years
 drooped into the hills of eternity

   slocum brightest of the lot had
 saved nothing

why ive drunk up more than the
whole bunch of em together ever saw 
- he muttered furiously see here mar-
mysteria the mind reader



maduke you better curb your ways or
one of these mornings you wake up in
an old peoples home

  he decided to keep his eyes open
eyes open much wider when looking
about in behalf of a conscience as elas-
tic as marmaduke slocums

  in pittsburgh opportunity in the
shape of one ten-strike penny
looked him up at the theater penny
was one of the greatest fakers in the
show business-also outside bloated
paste-faced but decidedly prosperous
he laid down his cards to marmaduke
and stepped back triumphantly

  i wouldnt handle your proposition
with counterfeit money declared
marmaduke slowly then paused as his
hand rested on his bald spot

  penny followed up the opening

quickly

  safe as an asbestos curtain i got
it all worked out

  at that reflected marmaduke i
believe we could put it over and there
are crookeder things-the pretzel busi-
ness for instance we divide fifty-
fifty eh

  fifty-fifty  do you think the girl
would fall in with it

  mysteria  answered marmaduke
say leave it to me shes shallow
got a mind deep like a coat of tan
shes in a trance most of the time sits
around dopy and eats butterscotch
everything that happens is strange to
her-no matter how often it happens
all she worries about is how to spend
the salary i give her  awful-lookin
purple and green clothes-and more
butterscotch if her conscience ever
bothers her it must be worrying be-
cause im takin two of the five hun-
dred iron men the treasurer pays us
everv saturday night there she is

  		v	

now hi come here miss mysteria
i want you should meet mr penny
mysteria hesitated openly and almost
shrank back startled penny was dis-
sipated looking enough to scare any
woman

  shake hands encouraged marma-
duke he hasnt got any horns

  its a nice day suggested mysteria
in compromise

  so i read in the japanese news-
papers retorted penny with an oily
wheedling servile smile

  this mr penny went on marma-
duke has a swell business proposition
to make you-as its a sure winner
and theres big money in it we want
to talk private can we go to your
dressing room

  mysteria led the way the men sat
on trunks after she had moved two
small mountains of multicolored plum-
age and she perched on the edge of
a chair by her make-up shelf

  its this way explained penny
marmaduke here is getting old
youve only got a few more years of
this stuff ahead of you then the peo-
plell tire of you an youll find it hard
gettin bookins you both have worked
hard an deserve to clean up while the
cleanins good i have-er-a propo-
sition along that line

  mysteria produced a hunk of butter-
scotch from somewhere and began re-
moving the paper wrapper penny
watched her alertly sizing her up toy-
ing with a big wart on his fat neck

  talents such as you have he went
on it is my opinion shouldnt be hid
under no bushel while youre tellin
some one where to find lost rings an
husbands might as well find somethin
for vourself youre booked into lex-
ington week after next and if you make
your second-sight powers work over-
time i think you can locate some buried
treasure

  this treasure is buried in old socks
and savings banks and a little exercise
out in the big bad world would do it
good the point is this  youve played
lexington four years straight and
youve rung the bell every time they
never caught you up on nothin that
was a swell stunt you pulled off tellin
the woman shed find her watch in stall
number sixteen out to the race track
course marmaduke here happened to
find the watch but they didnt know
that theyr think its the spirits or the
devil or whatever guides you when
youre in this hoakum thing you call a
trance lexington is plumb nuts about
you if you told em new york was

light theyre just itching to invest

teria the hard chewing calms my
nerves well mr bunk as long as

  wonderful wonderful cackled
ten-strike penny bright girl here
marmaduke she knows which side

first for her business is business
suppose you both have dinner with me

-er-uncomfortable if mislaid well

duke here knows me

  id loan you my last nickel penny
marmaduke supported warmly me
an mysteria here are both grateful
you let us in on this we can float
it for you all right theyll fall like
dead leaves for the advice of mys-
teria the mind reader the element
of superstition is one of the most fun-
damental features of modern civiliza-
tion veneer it all you want to but
as soon as it comes to money or poker
or love affairs or strayed ones they all
begin to watch for signs and omens
i knew a professor of atheism or some-
thing who carried a buckeye in his
pocket for rheumatism even myself
i fall for that old superstition of the
stage-bad luck if any one whistles in
your dressing room well probably
land suckers in lexington youd never
dream of superstition is like lightning
-never know where itll strike next
penny got busy with telegraph
blanks and three days later an elderly
widow with a son the size of a fox
hound arrived in lexington and took
lodgings for an indefinite period at a
respectable rooming house

  almost directly she missed a cameo
locket of pink coral and advertised two
hundred dollars reward and no ques-
tions asked the size of the reward
looked to the new-spapers like a good
human-interest story and they took it
up it developed that the locket was
an heirloom and the widowed lady was
all broken up over its loss

  whos this mysteria the mind
reader that i hear everybody talking
about  she queried innocently one
evening

  the landlady shook a whiu head
wise with age

  magic  black art they say shes
the real thing done some wonderful
things here been coming for years
most folks think shes a spiritualist
the landlady became violently seized
with an inspiration

  why dont you go ask her about
your locket

  no no widowed lady didnt believe
in fortune tellers of any kind all
mysteria the mind reader



right landlady would go herself go
she did

  the lady wants to know something
about some jewelry-a locket chanted
mysteria your locket you are ask-
ing but my control says- it isnt

yours-some one who lives with you
i see an elderly w oman shes lost some
one very dear to her there is a child
around her she will find her locket
in the grass under a park bench where
she was sitting the day she lost it i
get a call- and so on

  the landlady accompanied the widow
to the park bench the locket was dis-
covered  two hundred dollars reward
was paid-supposedly-to mysteria

  came the psychological night

  the theater was jammed people
sat on extra chairs in the aisles and
stood at the back the house lights
were switched on and marmaduke
stepped forth from the wings he was
in great spirits to-night gleeful at the
smooth running of the scheme to date
and in his introductory eulogy of mys-
teria the mind reader peeress who
defied investigation of public science
and clergy he called forth from old
pigeonholes in his brain all the dazzling
adjectives that had accumulated there
in circus days when marmaduke slo-
cum was with barnuni spieling be-
fore the side shows

  finally the oratory ended with the
gorgeousness of a falling skyrocket
and as marmaduke gestured low and
bowed to the left mysteria the mind
reader swept out she nodded haugh-
tily but graciously and licked her lips
the house figured it was nervous tem-
perament but marmaduke from long
experience recognized it as butter-
scotch

  the investigating committee blind-
folded her and examined her chair and
hair for invisible wires or wireless and
marmaduke began passing through the
audience

  this gentleman called marma-
duke and passed up the aisle they
had rehearsed it many times she was
to tell him he was thinking of making
an investment pit hole oil stocks
yes by all means take it the stock

would rise twenty-nine points on the
morrow and go to eighteen hundred
within two months

  eagerly hungrily as he catfooted up
the aisle his back to the stage mar-
maduke listened for the magic words
that were destined to open the coffers
of fortune

but now something was going wrong
mysteria the mind reader gifted
seeress and psychicest of the psychic
was silent as a ritz waiter tipped five
cents

  this gentleman  repeated marma-
duke sharply

  mysteria began to sputter finally
she spoke and marmadukes heart
bounded to the roof of his mouth as
he clenched his hands

  you are thinking of an investment
chanted the seeress pit hole oil
stocks i see trouble about them do
not invest they are dangerous

  marmaduke slocum and ten-strike
penny found mysteria in her dressing
room in hysterics so full of words
they knew not where to begin emitting
they stood very erect puffing cigars and
glaring at her finally penny growled
disgustedly

  you had em goin everything was
cornin your way yours to play super-
stition for under the wire-an you
muffed it

  i couldnt help it sobbed mysteria
two minutes before i went on every-
thing was all right and then as i go
downstairs a black cat jumps in front
of me im scared to death of them
they mean bad luck sure i used to
hear the darkies down south talk about
it when i was a little girl this cat
scairt me-made me get stage fright
and cold feet on the whole business a
black cat-bad luck 

  i was right about superstition any-
way comforted marmaduke as he and
penny tramped softly through the
stage entrance i was right about it
we all got it an you never know when
itll show up

  yeh agreed penny shortly with
a grunt the doctor took some of his
own medicine by mistake

delieve me hereafter whenever i meet

     a chap who is digging a ditch in the street
   ill bring up my hand and salute

 for i have been learning in sap and bayou
 how hard you must work and how much you must know
 to be a good shovel recruit

 my hands are all blisters my muscles are lame
 from digging the sand and revetting the same
 in a properand soldierly style

 and all the night long as i lie in my bunk
 i dream about dirt by the ton or the chunk

   and sand by the linear mile

 i used to think trenches were simple and plain
 requiring no actual use of the brain

   but i was mistaken thats clear

 from what ive observed if you build them correct
 you need to be carpenter drain architect
 and plumber and mine engineer

 so were getting plenty of drill from the start
 till we learn every phase of the business by heart
 and we know all the hooks and the crooks

for when were commanding our men at the front
weve got to know all of this trench-digging stunt
without any help from the books

 i talk about parados wattling fascine

 and think that in time i will know what they mean
   though at present im hazy i guess 

perhaps when ive dug out a dugout or two
ill learn why im doing the things that i do

   and accumulate sense more or less

 and meantime im drilling with shovel and pick
 in sand that is heavy and mud that is thick
 constructing traverse and redoubt

and doing my sunday-school darndest to cope
with all the instructions ill learn them i hope

the lapses of larry loman

   by edgar wallace
   author of the man who knew etc
   ii-the affair of the stokehole

larry loman of the criminal
intelligence department was
called to a conference at head-
quarters and went with a cer-
tain sense of disappointment and irri-
tation though there was no reason for
a display of either of those emotions
for both his chief and the secretary of
state responsible for his department
had nothing but encouragement for
him

  you are not going to smash the
crime trust in a day said the chief
commissioner for special services

  i suppose there is no doubt about
there being a crime trust asked the
minister dubiously it seems such an
extremely melodramatic idea the sort
of thing one reads in sensational
stories

  it is a very good idea from the
criminals point of view said the com-
missioner quietly he has no worry
he is well supported whether he is
in prison or out he is always excel-
lently defended and if he is convicted
his unknown employers will take his
case to the court of criminal appeal-
if there is the slightest chance of a
sentence being reduced or a trial being
quashed the man who brought to-
gether all these expert criminals--and
the trust has no use for any other-
was a genius could anything be
neater than to run a forging plant in
a nursing home where all the rooms
except two or three were occupied by
genuine patients and all the staff ex-
cept the principal and a few of his
friends were genuine nurses and doc-
tors how are things shaping
larry

  larry loman his elbows  the

table his face between his hands
shook his head

  we have settled the forgeries he
said a little hopelessly but the other
departments of the trust are in full
swing and very successfully so

  for example- said the chief

commissioner

  the kidnaping and holding to ran-
som of lord frethermores heir

  i wanted to see you about that
said the minister do you think it is
the work of the trust 

  i am certain of it said larry em-
phatically look at the price they are
asking-sixty thousand pounds  no-
body but the trust would dare do it
nobody but the trust has the organi-
zation which would enable them to
carry out a scheme of that importance

  there is terrible trouble about the
kidnaping said the minister i have
brought you here to take you off the
trust and put you on to that

  larry laughed you can safely re-
tain me on the trust work he said
dryly all the bad crimes that will
be committed in this country during the
next twelve months will bear the in-
delible hall mark of that organization
you know the circumstances of the
kidnaping asked the commissioner

  larry nodded the boy was out
with his nurse in regents park the
nurse found herself in conversation
with a lady who suddenly turned faint
and had to be assisted to one of the
garden chairs when the nurse looked
round the child had gone and a motor
car was seen driving off in the adjoin-
ing roadway no number of the car
seems to have been taken by the time


the popular magazine

the nurse had found a policeman the
fainting lady had also disappeared
i lord frethermore is distracted
said the minister he has seen me
twice this morning he had a letter
from the gang here it is

  he passed the epistle across the
table it was typewritten on thick note-
paper and ran 

  i am holding your son to ransom and am
demanding three hundred thousand francs
for his release the money must be paid in
thousand-franc notes and delivered to a mes-
senger who will be a perfectly innocent
agent in the matter the method of the
boys restoration will be sent to you if you
advertise your agreement in the times

the kkight of industry

  the trust said larry confidently
they have used that signature before
from what i have heard the gentleman
who is at the head of the business at-
tends his board meetings in complete
armor with lowered visor

  theatrical nonsense growled the
minister

  it is neither theatrical nor nonsensi-
cal said larry calmly in the first
place he is protected against a chance
pistol shot from a traitor or a hidden
policeman and he is so completely dis-
guised that neither his face nor his
figure is observable i will take this
letter if i may he folded it up and
put it in his pocket i have an ap-
pointment with my specialist

 how is the memory trouble 
larry made a grimace i havent
had a recurrence for over a week
who is your doctor asked the
minister grayborn a clever fel-
low a man who has won the first
place in his profession by sheer indus-
try ten years ago a struggling prac-
titioner up to his eyes in debt through
an extravagant wife to-day i sup-
pose he is making more money than
any other man in his profession the
fees he charges me are prodigious-
prodigious 

  you are not making larry very
happy smiled the commissioner but
larry was incapable of further de-
pression that morning

  he was ushered into the consulting
room and the specialist without delay

wtent through the formal examination
which sir george grayborn always
gave to his patients

  i think youre all right said the
doctor you have had no further sud-
den lapses of memory 

  none said larry

  avoid excitement i know it is a
foolish thingto ask you but remember
that any undue excitement will pro-
duce that extraordinary lapse and blot
out hours of memory from your life
amnesia is a queer disease

  dont i know it said larry rue-
fully it is a nightmare to me every
time i realize that all the things that
happen to me after four may be com-
pletely forgotten until i recover my
memory at eight i live in dread of
that little buzz in the ear which tells
that memory is ringing off 

  wthere are you going this after-
noon  asked the physician suddenly

  nowhere in particular said larry
after a moments thought

  a little social recreation would not
do you any harm said sir george i
am going to a garden party at regent
gardens it is on behalf of the home
for factory girls will you join me
there 

  larry had made no plans for that
afternoon and it was a rule of his life
that when he had no plans he was pre-
pared to be guided by any fortuitous
development that day might bring
forth

  i will join you he said

  the ticket will cost you a guinea
and i will put itm my bill which by
the way will not be heavy he said
looking over his shoulder as he un-
locked a little cupboard behind his desk

  you are a thought reader among
other things sir george

  the physician did not reply he
handed the gilt-edged pasteboard to his
patient

  i will meet you at half past four
he said near the band stand

  dressing for the function larry
came to the conclusion that he might
have done worse than accept the invi-
tation if one of his extraordinary
memory lapses came on he would have
the lapses of larry loman



the advantage of his doctors society
and the observation which sir george
might make and what was no less im-
portant the data he might supply as
to what larry did while in the dubious
enjoyment of one of his periodical fits
of oblivion he dressed himself with
care for larry was something of a
dandy and was one of the best-dressed
men in town from his varnished
boots with their white well-fitting
spats to the top of his glossy silk hat
he might have stood as a model for
the beaus of the world he seldom
went abroad unarmed and now as a
final touch to his toilet he dropped a
revolver into his hip pocket the re-
sult did not please him for the bulge
of the weapon showed under the well-
cut morning coat

  he took out the revolver and re-
placed it with a little browning with
no great improvement he put the
browning on the table it was against
his best instincts to go out without
some kind of weapon and he pulled
open drawer after drawer and finally
selected a short and what was more
to the purpose flat hunting knife in its
sheath in a rough-and-tumble it might
be more useful even than firearms

  he drove to the gardefis and found
as he approached the entrance such
a block of taxicabs and private motor
cars that he descended and walked the
rest of the distance on foot he
crushed through the turnstiles and was
immediately pounced upon by a bevy
of beautiful brigands with tickets for
side shows and badges and flags and
refreshment vouchers

  he parted meekly with his money
and as soon as he could make his way
free of the crowd he wandered to the
part of the garden which he knew
would be unfrequented

  it was a glorious summer day the
hot june sun was tempered by a cool-
ing breeze and in the bosky sidewalks
with their high hedges of flowering
shrubs he found a certain restfulness
and comfort he passed a small tele-
phone box placed there as an inscrip-
tion informed him for the convenience
of visitors and he marveled at the

foresight and intelligence which had
induced the organizers to place this
very necessary connecting link with the
outside world in so quiet and retiring
a spot it would be useful when he
wanted to call his car

  he strolled on slowly for he knew
the path would soon turn him back
to the crush and then suddenly he saw
a girl ahead of him she was dressed
in white and her back was turned to-
ward him she was evidently selling
something for she had a little tray be-
fore her he debated the question as
to whether he would return but curi-
osity got the better of him here evi-r
dently was a kindred soul who also
wished to get free from the madding
throng he was walking past her when
she spoke

  wont you buy a little rose  said
a sweet voice

  he turned round and looked her in
the face and something buzzed in his
ears and memory stopped

  he knew his memory was returning
yet the sensation was as though he was
beginning life at its very commence-
ment and that all existence must date
from this moment he felt a strong
wind in his face and he knew his hands
were grasping something rough and
hard

  then he realized he was sitting on a
stone ledge he looked dowm and
strong as were his nerves he nearly
swooned then he looked back into
the black yawning chasm behind him
how had he got here  in the name
of heaven how had he got here

  he was sitting on the top of a high
chimney stack a hundred and fifty feet
above the level of the ground he
was dressed in his shirt and his trou-
sers he wore neither collar nor coat
his varnished boots were split and
scratched his white spats were black
he looked at his hand it was cov-
ered with soot and he gathered that
his face was in no better state

  he had recovered something of his
presence of mind something of the
coolness which he knew he had dis-
played through all this lapse of hours


the popular magazine

even though the sudden consciousness
of his position had temporarily shaken
his confidence and nerve he crawled
back to the black funnel of the stack
and looked down he had evidently
come up that way for inside the stack
as far as eye could see down were
iron rungs firmly fixed in the masonry

  at the worst he could go down that
way again he thought but even as this
method of escape occurred to him a
thick cloud of smoke billowed up from
the depths he crept round to the
other side of the parapet and what
he found brought comfort appar-
ently the chimney had at some period
been under repair and there was a
scaffolding here and a ladder which ran
at an alarming angle to join a further
ladder which so far as he could see
by lying flat on his face and looking
ever the edge continued to the foot
of the stack he shuddered at the
thought of making the descent by this
method but bracing himself up he
swung his legs over the platform felt
for the rungs of the ladder and began
his descent

  he was halfway down before it oc-
curred to him that some of the sections
of the ladder might not be in place
it evidently had been up for a con-
siderable time and one rung he touched
was so rotten that his foot crashed
through it fifty feet from the
ground he did indeed find that a short
length had either fallen or been pulled
from its place but by letting himself
slowly down till his feet touched the
top of the next section he was able
by grasping the staples which still re-
mained in the brickwork to make the
rest of the descent in safety

  it was not until he had reached the
ground that he realized that all the time
he had been carrying the knife in his
hand he carefully examined the
blade but it afforded him no clew
possibly a careful search of the build-
ings would assist him he was evi-
dently in the yard of a disused fac-
tory rusty old railway lines over-
grown by weeds discarded machine
parts in the same condition and a gen-
eral air of desolation pervaded the

yard which was inclosed by a high
brick wall he looked up at the chim-
ney which wras now sending out thick
smoke somebody must be here he
thought and he moved cautiously if
only he could remember what had hap-
pened in the last few hours

  pie heard the whir of a motor car
and crouching down behind a slag
heap he saw a car carrying three peo-
ple pass along the factory roadway and
disappear behind some low buildings
which he judged were somewhere near
the gate in this supposition he was
right for a little while later he heard
the clang of the gate as it closed

  he waited for five minutes but there
was no further sign of life the
smoke was thinning and was now but
a white tenuous mist that floated from
the top of the chimney he had al-
ready identified the building by a heap
of discarded tins bearing the label of
the boscombe enamel company a
derelict firm that had been out of busi-
ness for many years

  there were a number of sheds all
deserted some of them padlocked and
some windowless he reached wiiat
was evidently the engine house without
being challenged the smoke must
come from the stokehole and to the
stokehole he made his way the fire
doors were hot and the big furnace
was still filled with a red glowing
mass he picked up an iron rake and
poked about the inside and presently
pulled out a small metal bracket of a
familiar shape in its pristine days it
had been part of a telephone trans-
mitter he raked again and drew up
pieces of red-hot wire and the metal
part of a telephone receiver and shook
his head they meant nothing to him

 leading from the stokehole was a
steel door which he pushed and which
yielded under his touch he found
himself in a small room with walls of
whitewashed brick it had been newly
swept and there was a table and chair
wrhich were free from dust

  somebody has been here in the last
half hour said larry to himself and
stepped stealthily forward to the next
door he listened for he thought he
the lapses of lay loman



heard voices he gently pressed the
door and it opened somebody was
speaking within

  ill bet voull be glad to see his nibs
again wont you 

  the reply was so faint that larry
could not hear it

  well said the voice if you are a
good boy theyll let you go to-morrow
an if you ever see me in the street
dont you recognize me dye hear 
because if you do ill cut your throat
dye see what i mean

  larry balanced his knife in his hand
pushed the door open and walked into
the room a man in his shirt sleeves
was confronting a small and tearful
boy who sat upon what was evidently
his bed

  larrys heart gave a thump for he
recognized in the child the heir of the
frethermores the man did not hear
larrys entrance but something in the
boys frightened look-for larry in his
coating of soot was a terrifying sight-
made the man spin round as he did
the detective closed in on him and
dropped the point of his knife against
the lower button of the guards waist-
coat

 hands up said larry and
quick

  the mans hands went up he shot
a sidelong glance at a table and fol-
lowing his eyes larry saw the re-
volver and sprang for it

  i think you know me said the
young man i am mr loman of the
criminal intelligence department and

i	am going to take you into custody
on a charge of kidnaping

  its a cop said the man but
dont be so certain you are going to get
a conviction old friend

  not so much of the old friend 
said larry

  i have seen your prisoner said the
commissioner the next morning and
he has undergone at the hands of two
experienced police officers something
approaching the immoral and repre-
hensible third degree of the lt s a
which we so often condemn but which
is not without its uses would you like

me to reconstruct your remarkable
story 

  i wish you would sir said larry
earnestly i have been puzzling my
brains over the matter and i cannot
for the life of me recall one single in-
stant between half past four in the
afternoon and eight oclock that same
night

  then stand by for a little whole-
some reconstruction said the commis-
sioner i thought it would be an easy
matter because i had taken the pre-
caution of having you shadowed by
one of the best men at scotland yard
but he was unable to tell me a great
deal and i have the most important
part of the story from the fellow you
took in the works you were seen to
go into the shrubbery at twenty-five
minutes to five and you were followed
at a respectful distance by the officer
you were seen to speak to a lady sell-
ing flowers to pass your hand across
your forehead as though you were a
little stunned and then something
seemed to occur to you probably you
recognized the girl and you came strid-
ing back the way you had come and
met sergeant jackson whom you dis-
patched with orders to find sir george
grayborn at the band stand evidently
you were aware that the phase of for-
getfulness was closing in upon you
you then turned back and the sergeant
over his shoulder saw you go into the
telephone box why you went there is
conjectural i suggest that you in-
tended to telephone for your car

  larry nodded he remembered that
he had had that intention

  the rest of the story is told by our
prisoner as far as he witnessed it or
was able to learn the particulars from
those who participated you had no
sooner entered the telephone box than
two men sprang from the shrubbery
and slammed the door shutting you in
you will probably remember if you
saw it in the course of your wander-
ings that it was without windows and
that the interior was specially padded
to make it soundproof

  i noticed that said larry as i
passed the box the first time


the popular magazine

  the moment the door closed on you
you were helpless the other men who
were waiting in the shrubbery came out
lifted the box on their shoulders and
you were passed out of the gate placed
on a waiting motor lorry and driven
off it was a very neat trick and pos-
sibly even if you had not gone in of
your own accord you would have been
lured to thit part of the garden and in-
duced to enter the box

  i suggest that finding yourself sti-
fling you remembered your knife and
cut through the padding and the thin
wood and having secured air vents
you awaked developments you were
taken to the old factory my young
friend and this is where our kidnaping
prisoner offers firsthand testimony

  at a quarter past six in the after-
noon the lorry came in and the box
was carried into the stokehole which
was already filled with an assortment
of shavings wood and coal and you
and your box were thrust in you
must have realized your awful predica-
ment and have set to work desperately
to cut your way out to cscape through
the steel door of the furnace was im-
possible and i suggest that you
squeezed your way along the little tun-
nel which leads to the chimney shaft
and that minus your coat and hat and
all unnecessary impedimenta you
climbed the interior of the stack and
would probably have made a good de-
scent in fact the same descent that
you did make even had you not re-
covered consciousness of the immedi-
ate past i have had the works raided
and there is no doubt that this place

has been hired and fitted up with the
object of carrying out an extensive
scheme of kidnaping frethermores
child says that he had been there and
treated kindly since the day he was
whisked off

  the whole theory fits together
said larry and i have no doubt that
you are right

  i am certain i am right said the
commissioner quietly i myself have
been in the stokehole and have res-
cued-

  he rose and went to a cupboard
opened it and took out a battered and
shapeless object

  your stovepipe hat larry

  larry looked at the relic and laughed
also there were the marks of your
toes against the soot in the interior of
the stack bits of the lock of the tele-
phone box and several other et cet-
eras

  larry was thinking hard

  the girl who sold roses he said
suddenly it was she

 what demanded the commis-
sioner

  something about her face some-
thing that reminded me of-

  the commissioner nodded

  yes she was in it he said quietly
our prisoner said she came back to
the factory and went on her knees to
the rascal in charge of the cremation
and begged him to spare you

  i think when i meet her said
larry-and i know i have met her-
the crime trust will be very nearly on
its last legs

    the next story in this series is called  the cure and will be found in the
popular dated may th

a quick way to reckon time

according to the authority for this story a great many southern darkies
do not mind it very much when they are sent to the penitentiary

a group of them were on their way to the states prison in georgia
             jack asked one of them whut you in foh 

    aw bill mah wife she nagged me to death an i cut her up dey done
sont me down foh three yeahs how long you in foh

jt- oil a walk  the country you should
leave the road and cross the grassy
meadow and finally come into what
knibbs has described as the cool and
sleepy summer woods you will prob-
ably stand still for a moment paying an
unconscious tribute to the green won-
ders about you there is a quality about
the cool stillness the shaded light the
lolty branches arching hitll overhead to
remind you of the sanctity of some ca-
thedral and this is not remarkable
winll one remembers that the model for
the cathedrals groined arches is in the
in i brandies of the ancient kuropean
woods just as the model for the orien-
tal pagoda is found in the spreading
lent ol the tartar nomad

a a

m ost of us if our ancestry were
traced back would prove to be
descended i tom those wandering north-
ern tribes of kurope who came out of
the forest and left the touch of the for-
est on everything they built from the
homely thatched farmhouse to the gar-
goyle-haunted buttresses of xotre
dame you can sec the pointed pine in
the towers with their cone-shaped
roofs and the oak and the elm in the
arches of castle hall and monastery so
when we go back into the woods it

would be strange if some ancestral
memory did not stir now and then
within s to urge us to stay for a while
in the land of cool silence and green
distance and to recall for a little the
careless freedom of the childhood of
the race

a a

yt-so there are other less poetic
thoughts worth remembering in
regard to the forests last winter
when a large number of people in the
east were short of coal we remem-
bered that there was probably enough
water power going to waste in the
united states to do most of our light-
ing and heating for us at the very
least without the forest there can be
no water power save where it is fed
by the eternal snows the river is a
freshet in spring and a dry gully in the
heat of summer unless there are woods
 the hillsides to preserve and distill
the rains so that they flow as rivers the
jear round floods in the springtime
covering the valleys and sweeping away
houses droughts in the summer-this
is the price paid for cutting away the
trees the bare hills of china and the
deserts of syria are memorials to the
ruin caused by the destruction of the
forests

        guard of timberline the tiew
novel by geofge washington
ogden which appears complete  the
next issue of thk popular is a story
of the fight lo preserve the american
forests from the spoilers there is
something hroad and epical about the
theme in a large measure it has been
a political fight and in many cases it
has taken the form of an actual physical
struggle we think that some time in
the future the question of what we did
with our forests will he a much more
important one than what we did about
the tariff ogden has written a big
novel on a big subject he knows what
lie is writing about and he is essentially
a novelist o the outdoors you will
remember ogden as the author of th
fighting sheepman and that fine
epical tale of the oil industry unlucky
men

jo matter what your present occupa-
tion is it has probably been af-
fected more or less by the great war
in europe our entry into the war has
produced something like a business rev-
olution the war brought bigger busi-
ness and bigger profits to most of the
canadian industries and it seems likely
to do the same for us every great war
in the past has been an era of financial
change and has signalized the appear-
ance of new business and new accretions
ot wealth xot all the fortunes in the
present business revival are being made

in mlinitioiis of siilpltiiidirif there
afe other industries entirely new to the
united stales before the war there
wras practically no dye industry in
america germany had fitted herself
by long laboratory experiments to make
dyes for the world and she was mak-
ing them and selling them just at
present american manufacturers are
supplying the home market with dyes
and in a short time they will be supply-
ing a good part of europe

a a

jlle green scarf which starts in
the next issue of thk popular
is a story of big business as affected
by the war it is not a story of ger-
man spies or anything of the kind but
just a tale of modern american busi-
ness men if you read it you will learn
that a lot of the romance and adventure
goes on behind office doors and in lab-
oratories it is by an author new to
the pages of the popular howard

former united states senator mason

 pioneer in pure food and drug legislation father
 of rural free delivery system

   says nuxated iron

increased his power and endurance so much

 that he feels it ought to be made known to
 every nervous run-down anaemic man

 woman and child

 opinions of dr ferdinand king new york physician
  and medical author dr james francis sullivan
  formerly physician of bellevue hospital outdoor
  dept new york and others

- wiiat senator mason says -

   i liave often said i would never recommend
 medicine of any kind i believe that the doctors
 place however after the hardest political cam-
 paign of my life without a chance for a vaca-
 tion i had been starting to court every morn-
 ing with that horrible tired feeling one cannot
 describe i was advised to try nuxated iron
 as a pioneer in the pure food and drug legisla-
 tion i was at first loath to try an advertised
 remedy but alter advising with one of my medi-
 cal friends i gave it a test the results have
 been so beneficial in my own case i made up my
 mind to let my friends know about it and you
 are at liberty to publish this statement if yon
 so desire  am now sixtii-flre years of age anl
 i feel that a remedy which will build up the
 strength and increase the power of endurance of
 a man of mif aie should be made knotrn to every
 -nerroirs run-down anaemic man luoman and
 child

   senator masons statement in regard to nux-
 ated iron was shown to several physicians who
 were requested to give their opinions thereon

former united stales senator wm e
  mason recently elected member of
  the u s congress from illinois

 dr ferdinand king a now york physician and
 medical author said  i heartily indorse senator
 masons statement in regard to nuxated iron
 there can be no vigorous iron men without iron
 pallor means anaemia anainia means iron defi-
 ciency the skin of antemie men and women is
 pale the flesh flabby  the muscles lack tone  the
 brain fags and the memory fails and often they
 become weak nervous despondent and melancholy
 dr james francis sullivan formerly physician of
 bellevue hospital outdoor dept new york and
 the westchester county hospital said senator
 mason is to be commended on handing out this
 statement on nuxated iron for public print there
 are thousands of men and women who need a
 strength and blood builder but do not know what
 to take in my own opinion there is nothing better
 than organic iron-nuxated iron-for enriching the
 blood and helping to increase the strength and en-
 durance of men and women who burn up too rap-
 idly their nervous energy in the strenuous strain
 of the great business competition of the day

 former health commissioner kerr of the city of
 chicago says  from my own experience with
 nuxated iron i feel it is such a valuable remedy
 that it ought to be used in every hospital and pre-
 scribed by every physician in this country

 dr e sauer a boston physician who has studied
 abroad in great european medical institutions said 
 senator mason is right as i have said a hundred
 times over i regard organic iron as the greatest of
 all strength builders iron is absolutely necessary
 to enable your blood to change food into living tis-

 sue without it no
 matter how much
 or what you eat
 your food merely
 passes through you
 without doing you
 any good you dont
 get the strength out
 of it and as a con-
 sequence you be-
 come weak pale and
 sickly looking just
 like a plant trying
 to grow in a soil
 deficient in iron if
 you are not strong
 or well you owe it
 to yourself to make
 the following test 

see how long you
can work or how far
you can walk with-
out becoming tired

nest take two five-
grain tablets of or-
dinary nuxated iron
three times per day
after meals for two
weeks then test
your strength again
and see how much
you have gained i
have seen dozens of
nervous run-down
people who were
ailing all the while
increase their
strength and endur-
ance in from ten to
fourteen days time
while taking iron in the proper form and this after
they had in some cases been going on for months
without getting benefit from anything many an
athlete and prize-fighter has won the day simply be-
cause he knew the secret of great strength and en-
durance which comes from having plenty of iron in
the blood  while many another has gone down in in-
glorious defeat simply for the lack of iron

  note-nuxated iron which was used by senator
mason with such surprising results and which is pre-
scribed and recommended above by physicians is not a
secret remedy but one which is well known to drug-
gists everywhere unlike the older inorganic iron
products it is easily assimilated does not injure the
teeth make them biack nor upset the stomach the
manufacturers guarantee successful and highly satis-
factory results to every purchaser or they will refund
your money it is dispensed by all good druggists

 senator masons championship
 of pure food and drugs legisla-
 tion llis fight for the rural free
 delivery system and his strong
 advocacy of all bills favoring
 labor and tho rights of the masses
 as against trusts and combines
 made him a national figure at
 washington and endeared him to
 the hearts of tho working mall
 and the great masses of people
 throughout the united states
 senator ilason lias the distinction
 of being one of tho real ly big men
 of the nation his strong en-
 dorsement of nuxated iron must
 convince any intelligent thinking
 reader that it must be a prepara-
 tion of very great merit and one
 wliieh the senator feels is bound
 to be of great value to the masses
 of people everywhere otherwise
 he could not alford to lend liis
 name to it especially after his
 strong- advocacy of pure food and
 drugs legislation

 since uxatcd iron has obtained
 such an enormous sale-over three
 million people using it annually-
 other iron preparations are often
 recommended as a suhstituteforit
 tile reader should remember that
 there is a vast difference between
 ordinary metallic iron and the or-
 ganic iron contained in kuxated
 iron therefore always insist 
 having nuxated lion
