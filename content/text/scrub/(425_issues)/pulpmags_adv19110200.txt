it seldom rains in arizona
the narrow valleys that drain
southward into mexico are the
most arid in america but on
the night old nunez pico died a black
cloud rolled over the ragged rim of the ca-
nille mountains dragged itself slowly along
was ripped by the granite teeth collapsed
and fell in a deluge of rain the bare stone
shoulders of the mountain heaved the floods
into the canyons from whose monstrous
throats it came bellowing into the valley
the river-bed was overbrimmed and the
lowland became a sea
 far into the night we sat about the long
table upon which lay the shrouded form of
the old spaniard the solemnity of the
vigil the feeble light and the tumult of the
storm depressed our minds and caused our
speech to be low and infrequent and it was a distinct relief to me when major blanchard said twenty years ago to-night we had just such a storm as this something in the tone of his voice and in the introspective eyes of the old soldier moved me to say major if there is a story waiting to be told it would be kind of you to give it to us now this watch is going to be heavy and long he mused for a moment then said it is hardly a story yet more than an episode it was the finest tragedy i ever witnessed without further urging he began nunez pico after fifteen years of life upon this ranch revisited his early home in

spain and returned bringing with him his only daughter who after her mothers death had been reared and educated in seville it is not surprising that she found little happiness in this isolated valley she was a splendid woman and her superiority of blood and training was at once and universally recognized by the inhabitants of this half-wild land none of the young rancheros was bold enough to lay siege to her heart and the lady isola as she was usually called passed many lonely days tigre palladis was a gambler a robber and many times a homicide he was born to his estate of lawlessness his mother was a spanish-indian half-blood his father an american adventurer of the worst type who was killed while tigre was a babe possibly it was because of his fathers ignominious death that the boy always bore his mothers name the young devil grew into a marvelous physical manhood indeed he was the handsomest animal i ever saw-very tall of an exceedingly powerful build and with a lightness and impetuosity of movement that indicated immense vital force dark of face and dark of heart he was as all who knew him knew yet there was something in his contemptuous defiance of lawful restraint and in his measureless strength and lightning-like energy of action in emergency that aroused enough of hero-worship in the hearts of the half-wild people of the valley to have spared him long and to have shielded him from the vengeance earned by many a desperate deed had he not chanced to meet the lady isola the love that flamed in his volcanic heart did not illuminate his reason it did not counsel patience reformation of character abandonment of lawless ventures and subjugation of his turbulent spirit but seemed rather to multiply his activities and to increase the violence of his temperament had the lady accepted his attentions or even yielded the fine courtesy she gave to the poorest peon upon her fathers ranch it might have been better for her and for him at the last but she seemed both to scorn and to fear him she would neither receive him in her home nor walk abroad when he was in the vicinity i knew nunez pico well his was the loftiest soul i ever hope to find on earth the prayer of his distressed child to be permitted to return to spain moved him deeply
but he refused to believe that danger threatened her and he could not bear to part with her in the simple sincerity of his nature he sought the disturber of his home and pleaded with him to leave his daughter in peace but the passionate idolater would give no promise and swore that his love should yield to no earthly bar however after this interview tigre left the valley and was heard of in mexico pico believed the trouble ended not so the lady isola it was plain that her distress was unabated she clung to the house not venturing into the fine garden that lay between her window and the river forsaking her loved hammock on the wide eastern porch and pacing the long hall with a nervous step in her dilated eyes one could mark the panic of her soul a month after tigres departure i visited pico never before had i seen the garden so beautiful the intense heat of the afternoon failed at sunset and the full moon rose in cloudless beauty beyond the crenelated wall of the canille mountains the air was delicious in its clearness and serenity so great was the temptation to escape the stifling heat still retained by the rooms that isola yielded to her fathers request and mine and came out upon the east porch and sat for an hour listening to our talk but taking no part therein the soft moonlight fell over her like a veil it seemed more to conceal than to reveal her it dimmed the traces of sorrow and softened the unnatural luminosity of her eyes she was very beautiful and as i watched her face from my position in the shadow of the great clematis vine her expression of hopelessness and terror was almost unbearable i was younger then than now and as i said isola pico was very beautiful moving my seat into the light i looked across the silent garden and little shining river to the highlands beyond in the silvery glory the landscape came out like a cameo the garden seemed alert and watching with a thousand eyes beyond the garden the slender river gleamed in its stony bed wasted by the summers heat it was too weak to grieve in the lowland beyond the river a space of alfalfa ran to the first swell of the foot-hills upon the plain at the base of the use a great rock deeply imbedded in the earth and rising fifty feet above the surface was all in shadow but as

the moon overlooked the mountain crest the top of the rock seemed slowly to rise from out the darkness and break into the white flood this movement appeared so real and affirmative that i turned to isola to learn if she had noticed it she did not heed my action but sat with her eyes fixed upon the rock with such a stare as one might have who saw the rending of the solid earth quickly turning i saw that on the top of the rock a man was standing with lifted face and folded arms the pose was grandly pathetic the form looked larger than human in the wan moonlight i was about to break the silence with an exclamation when a mighty voice a noble barytone came rolling across the distance wave upon wave bearing the burden of an old and half-forgotten love-song the god who wrought thee over-sweet in loves old garden long ago gave me the curse of wandering feet the power to know and only know that even god shall not repeat the agony of loving so when the refrain was reached i was thrilled as the singer substituted another name for the one written in the old song and the night was stirred by a burst of passionate melody that will haunt my memory while i live isola love i love thee isola hear my cry the skies are black above me love me or bid me die isola isola love me or let me die as the wonderful voice held the last word at the top of the register without a quaver the lady arose stood unsteadily for a moment then turned and walked proudly to the hallway and disappeared within nunez pico rose and without a word followed his daughter that night i could not sleep and near morning left my room and paced the garden walks until daybreak then drawn by curiosity i crossed the river and came to the great rock at the foot of the rise here i found the trace of a horse coming and going and behind the rock evidence that the horse had stood there for many hours the lady isola came to the breakfast the following morning without a tear-stain
upon her face her features set and cold the look in her proud eyes seemed to say my hours of terror are done i am master of myself she moved about the house the porches and the garden as freely as of old but with a different manner then it was with the languorous grace of one in love with idleness now she moved with the proud militancy of one who asserts dominion and defies aggression i was glad of the changed mien and so i think was pico when on that evening she passed me going down into the garden she seemed to have grown taller so martial was her carriage i sat long in the gathering dusk with little note of passing time when suddenly a womans shriek clear high and long-drawn rose from the garden followed almost instantly by the thunder of galloping hoofs upon the stony bed of the river a plash of water the muffled sound of a falling earth-bank and then the lessening throb of flying feet that died upon the night the shriek the rush of the trampling feet through the garden the vault of the steed over the adobe wall and the uproar of the steel-shod hoofs upon the stones of the river-bed did not occupy five seconds and before i could leap from the porch and rush through the garden shrubbery the beat of the retreating feet sounded faint and far the aroused household acted with desperate energy swift messengers called the assistance of all the neighboring ran-cheros the cinching of saddle-girths the clank of arms the trampling of impatient horses the sharp orders of pico and the headlong incoming of horsemen from the outer night told of stern preparation that boded ill for the frenzied abductor but before the pursuit could be taken up the storm came over the obsidian hills and broke upon the valley with lightning thunder roaring wind and such a downpour of rain that within half an hour the river could not be crossed except by a detour of many miles and then only by leading our horses singly upon a frail swinging bridge intended only for pedestrians however the cloudburst passed as quickly as it came and the trail was taken before midnight despite the obliterating effects of the storm the trace was easy to follow for one had joined us whose fame as a tracker in mountain and desert was supreme in arizona and mexico and when cady rode out taking the trail
 adventure
at a gallop all were content to follow blindly none questioned his skill nor his coolness and courage in the hour of conflict all had heard stories of his almost miraculous feats in the following of horse-thieves and marauding indians to their ruin but few i think were prepared for the ease and certainty with which this man-hunter carried the trail at a speed as high as we dared urge our horses over flinty mesas up slopes of broken lava through thorny fields of cactus and sage-brush across a succession of lateral ravines that now for the first time in many years brought down to the river a hundred roaring streams and on across scrub and chaparral to the south toward the outlaws hoped-for refuge in the mountains of mexico it was a wild ride and there were thirty wild men riding pico half crazed by the horror of his daughters possible fate urging on with brief inflammatory appeals the already excessive ardor of the pursuers cady silent and alert rode a rod or two in advance followed by kenneth picos foreman a gigantic scotchman a violent man of great physical power and energy i rode with pico when the exigencies of the trail permitted the others followed as best they could keep the pace at sunrise we were thirty miles south of the pico ranch and upon the high mesa two miles east of the river here the trail entered but did not cross a deep and rough ravine that ran at right angles to the course hitherto taken by the fleeing desperado cady plunged without hesitation down the steep bank and clung to the lessening trace over bare spaces of slab stone clean-washed by the storm and across acres of boulder-covered bars until the portal of the canyon was reached where the storms of ages had cut a narrow channel to the river before this rock-walled gateway cady halted leaped from his horse and waited until all had come up  dismount men he said the beast is at bay  this canyon he said twists to the right a hundred yards below then opens into a big triangle facing the river the jaws are two hundred yards apart but each jaw is jammed square against the precipitous bank of the river the bank on this side is a basalt bluff twenty feet high the opposite bank is low and a trail leads up a ravine from the water to the obsidian hills tigre knows the trail but he forgot the storm do you hear the roar of the river it is filled with jagged blocks of basalt and the flood is now a regular water-cyclone no horse or man that ever lived could cross it the game is bagged there is a heavy thicket along the bluff on this side of the river and he will be in the brush there will be a fight every man must cover himself as best he can take no chances on tigre palladis shoot anything that moves the woman will be hid dismounted we followed down the gorge until we reached the outlet and noted the heavy wall of brush that hid the river from our view beyond this the rage of the waters made itself manifest in terrible bel-lowings cady said  there may be trouble in the first fifty yards of open ground and every man must make straight to the thicket move rapidly if tigre fires riddle the spot from which the shot comes and run in upon him shoot him down he will not surrender our rush followed and was met by the crack of a winchester ramon aguates a young ranchero threw up his hands spun around upon his toes and fell stone-dead he had hardly touched the ground when another man close by my side sank slowly to his knees gave a little sigh and crumpled up into a shapeless heap tigres second shot was not heard as our volley came at the same instant our second volley cut a wide swath in the foliage at the point where the smoke from the desperados rifle hung and was instantly followed by a womans scream  hold men cried pico we are killing my child cady sprang into the open and raising his right hand cried  tigre give us the lady uninjured and i swear that you shall go and not be followed no answer came and it may be that the rivers voice drowned the call neither did any shot follow not knowing what to expect we crept forward taking the protection of every shrub and stone until we reached and entered the thicket here we recognized our disadvantage in that we dared not fire upon any moving thing until we first ascertained whether it be friend or foe but tigre would know that every sound or motion marked an ene-  tigre and isola  my yet to our amazement no rifle cracked and neither sight nor sound indicated the presence of our desperate quarry at last we came upon the body of the horse the splendid animal had been struck by a number of our bullets and to put it out of its misery its throat had been cut how cool the fellow must have been to conceive and execute the deed of mercy in  a moment of such mortal peril near the body beside an ugly pool of blood we found one of the lady isolas slippers and a few scattered beads from a turquoise necklace the thoroughly ransacked thicket yielded nothing more as we stood upon the rock rim looking down into the boiling water pico cried   he has killed her thrown her body into the river and then drowned himself  i felt this to be true and was about to say so when cady who had been standing apparently lost in thought called to me in sharp tones indicative of great excitement major give me your glass quick i handed to him the large field-glass i carried looking through it at the farther shore for a moment he turned to me and cried as god lives the madman has crossed that water-hell impossible i cried a man would be dashed to pieces in five seconds   nevertheless it is true  he said  look for yourself taking the glass i searched the farther shore and there plainly to be seen were the deeply set footprints of a man in the wet sand at the waters edge and higher upon the rocks of the ravine were the splotched and straggling lines made by the water drained from the wet clothing the outlaws tremendous achievement which under other circumstances would have lifted my admiration to enthusiasm passed from my thought as i marked that his footprints were alone no small tracks were beside his nor were there any traces of a dragged body evidently in ins flight from the grasp of the river tigre had not turned to look for his pursuers nor down the stream for the poor girls body if the hand of murder had given it to the waves a hush of awe and horror fell upon us and many seconds passed before it was broken by cadys low masterful voice pico take two men go down to the mouth of alkali wash and watch for the body all the drift swings in there when the water is high ride fast and you will be in time the major and i will see this hunt to the end come major we can cross two miles above here but it will be six miles as we ride  back we went to our horses leaving four men to care for the dead and at last after many slides and zigzags reached the river at a point where the current was slow cadys horse took the water by a plunge from the crumbling bank and we followed swimming our animals to a narrow shingle at the base of the opposite bluff following this stony passageway a short distance we scaled the hill after a struggle that left a number of our horses useless and after a brief rest fifteen of us rode on we struck the trail two miles from the river at the point where the ravine rose to the level of the mesa and followed it across rugged country-hard upon our horses and harder too it must have been for the indomitable man who crossed it on foot keeping a direct course for the mountains the blood-stains found in many places indicated severe wounds yet the length of his strides and the deep impressions of his feet proved that he had passed at great speed what exhaustless fountain of infernal energy supplied the strength to maintain this reckless waste many times we asked ourselves this question as hour after hour we urged on our flagging horses no animal is equal to man at his best and here i think was natures masterpiece we climbed the first foothills at sunset as night came on with clouds obscuring the moon the pursuit became impossible and we unsaddled our tired horses spread our blankets and slept until daybreak frequently since recovering the trail cady had dismounted and closely examined the footprints of the fleeing man with a look in his eyes that puzzled me it betokened amazement admiration and something akin to pity when we took the saddle at sunrise the pace was forced and within a mile we came to the spot where tigre had passed the night and i was amazed to find that wounded and wearied unto death as he must have been he had with much patient toil gathered from far and near enough of weed-stems and grass-blades to make a soft couch whereon   adventure to pass the night the scant growth upon the waterless mesa betrayed the labor necessary in such gleaning the bed at about the position occupied by the sleepers breast was heavily stained with blood perhaps it was on account of his wounds that he gave such effort to provide a comfortable couch cady looked steadily at the pitiful bed carefully examined the blood-stains then turned to mount his horse muttering   my god i knew it and yet it seems impossible the hunt went remorselessly to the end through beds of cactus that stabbed and stung up slopes of broken lava that tore the horses feet through greasewood wastes rising to the sterile buttresses of the obsidian hills we followed on until i began to wonder if human feet had made this trail at last as the sun was low in the west we entered a canyon leading up into the heart of the mountain range a slender rill issued from it and a dense clump of brush filled the bottom from wall to wall we were following the foot of the basaltic bluff upon our left and were about to enter the thicket when cady suddenly halted and threw up his hand with a gesture so full of meaning that all pulled up and every rifle was thrown forward for instant use after a long pause in which no word was spoken cady signaled for all to dismount as we stood in silence i plainly heard the heavy breathing of some laboring thing and the slight rustling of the brush the sounds slowly approached the branches parted and tigre palladis stepped into the open a dozen rifles covered him in a second and a volley would have instantly followed had not cadys voice sharp and imperious rung out hold men there is no need now the outlaw stood motionless looking straight into the muzzles of the leveled guns his aspect was terribly pathetic the butt of his heavy rifle rested upon the ground his right hand upon its muzzle the torn and disheveled clothing spoke pitifully of the dreadful journey his head was bare the waves of black hair tumbling about his neck his face was shrunken and pallid and the nostrils were updrawn as we often see them in the article of death the lips were apart like those of a runner at the end of a desperate race but the jaws were locked and grim his eyes were glorious i once joined in a lion hunt in upper nubia a great male lion many times wounded was surrounded in a copse of mimosa brush with twenty guns leveled we stood waiting while the beaters hurled fragments of stone into the cover instantly the branches parted and with bristling mane and grand uplifted head the desert king came forth for a moment he stood in his defiant attitude gazing at the threatening guns then the royal mane fell the great eyes blenched the huge head sank and the fierce beast turned and slunk into the copse i recalled this nubian episode as i now stood looking upon this hunted thing but this was not a lion-it did not blench there was a fearful silence no one seemed to know what to do or say at last cadys voice broke the silence the low measured tones vibrating with feeling   tigre god knows i should like to save you if the lady isola- his words were abruptly broken off by kenneth the big scotchman roughly pushed him aside fiercely crying   save that bloody brute hold up your hands you cowardly murderer what we then saw was a most wonderful thing the outlaws face glowed with such radiancy as comes to men only in moments of ineffable joy with electrical swiftness the heavy rifle was whisked backward whirled with a swish over his right shoulder and hurled forward with the rest-sistless force of a cannon-shot i heard the flutter as the weapon spun in the air like a revolving wheel the crunch of the splintered ribs and the sickening smash as the body of kenneth was slammed back against the canyon wall as a wind-gust slams a door then came a spurt of smoke from a dozen rifles and the jar of the volley the combined blow of the bullets shook the outlaws breast as though he had been struck with a heavy club and a great red splotch flared out upon his bosom the light slowly faded from his dauntless eyes and feebly turning like one who walks in his sleep he passed within the copse an instant later we heard the fall of a heavy body and then out rang a cry a shriek of frenzied agony a womans wail carrying in its tones such horror and despair as to chill the blood within my heart i turned to cady and the expression upon his white and drawn face appalled me his hands shook as they slowly relaxed dropping his  two on trinity  rifle upon the ground in a low voice trembling with emotion he cried great god i knew it we shot her at the river and he swam with her through that water-hell for two days he carried her mangled body before our horses i knew why his footprints were so deep i knew for whom that couch of grass was made at last he knew she was dying and he came out to be killed god of heaven what manner of man was this rushing into the brush i found the body of palladis lying upon the back with arms outspread the dying woman had crawled to his side her arms were about his head her lips upon his face and as she kissed him she cried with a passion that should have mocked the power of death   oh tigre tigre i will tell you now  feebly she drew her lips to his ear and whispered something i could not hear her arms tightened about his head there was a slight tremor of the slender body-and the lady isola pico was dead major blanchard rose and stepping to the table lifted the covering from the face of his old friend he looked long and steadily upon the placid features of the dead as he replaced the veil he said in the cemetery at old nogales there stands a beautiful monument of pink onyx bearing the simple inscription tigre and isola nunez pico was the noblest man i ever knew   two on trinity by frank lillie pollock i in all the seas there are few more beautiful spots none more lonely than trinity island it lies in the i--i high longitudes and the low latitudes and is a mere horseshoe of coral rising out of fathomless black water overgrown with plume-like cocoanut palms and a hundred long pacific leagues from other land and from the beaten roads of ocean traffic beyond the occasion smoke-trail on the sky of a distant war-ship or a misguided tramp steamer navigation never comes near trinity island nevertheless years ago a great naval power saw fit to seize upon the spot for a coaling-station perhaps the excellent anchorage in the   adventure lagoon tempted to this step at any rate a flagstaff was planted sheds were put up for the good australian anthracite and provision was made for a resident keeper most of the coal is still there the flag still flies and the keeper is visited by a gunboat once in four or five months but the same keeper seldom sees many visits of the ship coulson accepted the berth because he had played the prodigal son in melbourne and sydney and had come to the end of even his husks he knew it would be lonely but he did not think he would mind he would have time for meditation and for reading he had always had a great idea of improving his mind and he packed in his chest a history of europe in seventeen volumes green cloth gilt which he had got from a man who owed him thirty pounds it was a ten days run from sydney they set down his chest in the galvanized-iron house on the beach and coulson saw the steamer evaporate into a smudge of smoke on the glittering horizon turning to look round he could see almost the whole extent of his domain the clustered palms rustled unceasingly in the wind with the flagstaff standing bare among them and the ugly heaps of coal below the surf circled him rhythmically with its monotonous s-sflcrash s-sh-crash sky and sea were as empty and shining as twin silver mirrors and between the double immensities the island seemed like a speck under the glaring lens of a great microscope thus began the strangest period of coul-sons life at first he found it as peaceful and pleasant as he had anticipated he bathed in the surf he fished from a canoe he looked for pearls he read his history of europe  to the middle of the first volume and then marked the place in case he should ever want to come back to it the atmosphere of the island was not favorable to hard reading but he discovered that there was a mild amusement to be derived from solitaire games of euchre and seven-up his right hand against his left he played checkers in the same way and tried chess but gave it up it was too much like trying to lift oneself by ones boot-straps it was a foregone conclusion that this could not last only a saint or an idiot can endure solitude it is said and coulson was neither he had been there about a month when the sudden sense of his hideous isolation struck him like a thunderbolt from a clear sky a vivid picture flashed through his mind of the roaring streets of sydney of the theaters the cafes the bars where he met a friend at every turn and as he looked over the cloudless circle of untroubled sea a sick horror of the place came upon him an overpowering terror of the sky and the water of everything that was so beautiful and so unhuman so that he crept back trembling into his little bungalow with the sweat streaming down his face for a time-he could never have told how long-coulson scarcely ate or slept he tramped the beaches he paddled far out to sea trying mechanically to find relief in fatigue and finding none all day the great blue circles glared at him unwinkingly mockingly he hated them at night the blues were merely three shades darker and fired with incandescent planets and he loathed them and day and night the merciless pulse of the surf beat like a swinging pendulum in his brain he could never get beyond hearing of that sound it was the very voice of the solitude at moments it seemed that he could endure no more and he would fling himself down and sob and curse in rage and loneliness but this period of torment wore itself out his nerves became dulled and coulson regained a little of his old equanimity it was not the same however the almost narcotic peace of the first days was gone and he found himself sinking into a black melancholia never had he been so conscious with a strange terror of the omnipotent forces around him the wind in the palms seemed to murmur threats or warnings sky and sea were full of menace and he watched the revolution of the days with suspicion he felt certain that disastrous events of some sort were about to take place and his heart was filled with a sullen bitterness against the men who had exiled him on this reef to be the plaything of these invisible powers this state of nervous expectancy lasted for weeks but nothing happened now and again to relieve the strain he resumed his games of cards his right hand against his left and it was through this amusement that he came to his great discovery in these highly introspective games he always identified himself with his left hand the cards he dealt to the right he considered as those of his opponent and he could not  two on trinity  help being struck by the regularity with which he beat himself he tried checkers with the same result luck and skill greater than his own seemed to direct the fall of the cards and the movement of the men against him and so it was that coulson came by degrees to realize that he was not alone on trinity island who his invisible opponent was on the other side of the table he could not guess but he understood clearly that there was nothing supernatural about him it was a man very like himself-indeed he always thought of him simply as the man-and coulson recognized rather vaguely that it was in some way his own fault that he could not enter into closer relations with him but the mere intangible presence of the man afforded coulson extraordinary pleasure he knew by some instinct when he was present and when absent he talked to him and though he received no audible answers he felt that he was understood at last the greatly-desired consummation took place-he was able to see him what he looked like coulson could hardly have said for he did not pay much attention to either the mans appearance or dress in fact he had a confused idea that if he had met him anywhere but on this dreary island he would not have been able to see him at all but this did not matter it was with the mind of the man that coulson was chiefly concerned and he no longer wondered that he had been beaten in every game when such a brain was against him they talked together at length or rather the stranger talked and coulson listened with growing admiration of the commanding forces of intellect and will that the man displayed as yet he knew nothing of the newcomers history but he detected in his friend a bitterness against the world equal to his own and he divined the existence of a vendetta that must end in a day of terrible reckoning the man was not a man to sit down tamely under injustice the supply gunboat arrived and its captain was apparently surprised to find coulson healthy and moderately cheerful though disinclined to talk much during the vessels brief stay in the harbor the man disappeared coulson easily understood that he preferred to remain for the present unseen and he said nothing to the crew of the gunboat on the subject the steamer went back to the world again the man returned from his hiding-place and after this the relations of the two prisoners became more confidential the stranger had been in every part of the world where coulson had been and he seemed to know everything that coulson had particularly wished to know a curious fact was that all this information was communicated in a way that made coulson feel that he had learned it all at some previous time and afterward forgotten it but their conversation turned continually back to one subject -to the undeserved sufferings endured by both of them and to the idea of retaliation by degrees he learned his companions history like himself the man had endured ill-fortune in the southern seas he had been persecuted by cabals and cliques of powerful enemies he had been kidnapped he had been imprisoned and finally escaping he had fled to this loneliest part of the pacific to mature his schemes for a triumphant return to the world reflecting with indignation upon this tale coulson recognized its similarity to his own experience he too he seemed to remember had been persecuted all his life he too had been imprisoned upon trinity island surely by no will of his own he too had suffered injustice of every sort he was the worlds creditor and as he meditated his bitterness grew to a quiet but fiercely burning heat of anger against the powers that had cut him off from all the desirable things of life and marooned him upon this ghastly rock in the deep seas the two men discussed these things and revolved plans of action it would have suited coulsons spirit to return to london or sydney and strew the streets with dynamite or poison the water-mains but these places were far away so the outer world reposed in quiet unconscious that an island in the centra pacific was fizzing and hissing with vengeance like a lighted bomb then came a novel disturbance across the water from the west boomed a sound as of distant thunder out of the spotless horizon it was the war-ships of the australian squadron at target-practise under the skyline and a little later a faint haze of smoke arose like a far-away sea-fight coulson listened to the noise and hated it there out of sight was the enemy strong with his brutal ironclads every one of which coulson would gladly have seen at the bottom of the pacific all day long   adventure the sound came at intervals that night he saw search-lights flashing across the sky like a northern aurora and early in the morning there was a long streak of smoke in the south which the fleet left as it steamed down toward auckland this interruption of his quiet strangely disturbed coulson but an odd chance turned it to his advantage on the following day he went out in his canoe to fish going farther out to sea than usual he espied a great reddish object floating awash with the waves it looked very like a sea-serpent and he paddled toward it on a nearer inspection he recognized it at once it was a whitehead torpedo undoubtedly lost from a battle-ship during torpedo-practise and drifting dead and derelict with its propelling gear run down being without its war head it was temporarily as harmless as a log and coulson took a hitch of a line a around it and towed it to the island the discovery of this torpedo raised in him a multitude of excited imaginings from that day he had a deadly weapon at hand and the man suggested to him many plans for its use he might sail far out to sea signal some passing steamer with a flare by night and contrive to attach the torpedo to her side or he might wait for the very unlikely event of a ship approaching the island but in the end it seemed best to commence his operations by waiting for the supply-ship and sending her to the bottom of the lagoon with celerity and precision in the absence of the percussion apparatus there would be some difficulty about exploding the torpedo but coulson with much labor drilled a hole into the powder chamber and attached a fuse enclosed in a rubber tube to protect it from wet then there was nothing to do but wait it was nearly a month before the gunboat was due and there had been no ships in sight since the departure of the ironclads when late one afternoon a trail of smoke appeared on the sky in the east it grew and approached though slowly and in time the hull rose above the water an hour later coulson made her out distinctly with his glass she was one of those jerry-built ocean tramps constructed by the mile and cut off in suitable lengths and by her painfully slow movements she was having trouble in her engine-room she passed the island within a mile and had begun to increase the distance a little when she suddenly stopped a cloud of steam escaping from her waste-pipe coulson had watched her with intense interest from the moment she came into view and the man was at his shoulder when she stopped coulson put down his glass calmly he knew that his enemy had been delivered into his hands the equatorial darkness shut down like a sudden curtain and the steamers lights twinkled like smoky stars across the water an hour after sunset they went down to the beach where the canoe lay attached the torpedo to a towline and the man got into the little craft and paddled out of the lagoon with the great red cigar in his wake coulson remained ashore he understood that his companion was the right person to carry the business through but though he stood on the beach he seemed to follow the progress of the canoe as if he had been aboard her he could even feel the shock of the waves and the successive impulses of the paddle-strokes as the man grim and silent in the stern forced the craft forward he could see the steamers lights growing brighter he heard presently the sound of voices and the clinking of hammers and then he saw the tall black sides just ahead towering up through the blue gloom slowly the canoe approached the ships overhanging stern she was high in the water so that a great part of her rudder showed above the surface and the man drew in the torpedo and made it fast coulson watched him with agonized suspense as he fumbled for matches to light the fuse and at that moment there was a sharp jingle of bells from the vessels interior a tremor shook her and the water boiled suddenly underneath the canoe collapsed and coulson found himself unexpectedly incomprehensibly precipitated into cool water struggling to grasp the canoe in the midst of foam and a horrible suction that was drawing him irresistibly downward a moment later there was nothing to be seen above the water but a dozen crimson threads drifting up through the froth and there was an irregular note in the pulsation of the propeller the mate leaning over the stern signaled to the bridge stop her he called something has fouled the screw the great todescans secret thrust by agnes egerton castle authors of the pride they had their time and we may say they were don lewis of madrid is now the sole remaining master of the

whether captains of fortune or town gulls were wont daily to foregather intent as much upon the gleaning of foreign news as upon the savory promise of a good dinner for the common room of the bolt-in-tun was rarely devoid of some new great man fresh from oversea experience and full of tales as a hen is of clucks here might you at all times reckon upon the diversion of tall stories of bohemia or eldorado of castiles splendor or cruelty of border onsets and leaguers of outfalls and camisadoes in portugal or muscovy of boardings wrecks and discoveries about the spanish main- admirable and much-admired adventures which nevertheless seemed to have left their hero none the wealthier save in fine-chased outlandish oaths but this day the last of september in the year  forty-fourth of queen elizabeths reign the ruffling community at the tun -old and young all lovers of a blade-was too deeply engrossed in the topic of the london hour o have much interest to spare for travelers tales yet the latest oracle of them all a man tall gray-bearded of freebooting manner and conscious truculence of mien was not only well prepared as his attitude testified to fill his post with due relish but unlike many of his kind bore evidence of having really countered many hard knocks of fate one hollow orbit a gash that had shorn his weather-beaten countenance of the best part of an ear not to speak of a left hand reduced to one finger and the thumb-each memento of adventure might in its turn have served for fitting introduction to some tall story for the moment he sat in moody silence his single eye roaming fierce and wary from one to the other of the eager faces about him-watching for the chance it seemed of springing upon the talk and holding it as his own from time to time he lifted the ale pot to his lips with that mutilated hand that yet showed menace in its pinch at length a scanty stock of patience seemed on a sudden to fail him for he raised a voice that drew every eye suddenly full upon him vincent again quoth he by the curse of mahound and who may this vincent be that ye all should be gathering in   adventure t thought like so many rats to-day round his carcass let us be talking of living men my springalls and let the dead go rot for by your laments i take it that hes dead in his bed even as any old woman-this same gallant vincentio saviolo for an instant there was that pause around the table which marks some monstrous pronouncement then a sudden clamor among the huffing crowd a scraping of boots and spurs as sundry started to their feet a mouthing of oaths a jingling of cans as others turned upon their bench to confront the blasphemer it required all mine hosts persuasiveness to quell the rising threat-aided no doubt by the steadiness of the adventurers single orb that looked with such mastery out of the tanned visage i pray you masters no tumult here and on this day and pray you good captain strongitharm you should know that the name of vincent saviolo the great master of fence who died but yestereve is one we speak here with respect where shall he be mourned more than at thebolt-in-tun which has sounded to his tread daily these twenty years but you are from foreign parts captain and have not known him twas the tallest man of his hands at all manner of weapons but above all at rapier play asserted a gallant from the end of the table and made in dumb show with his two forefingers extended the sketch of a pass with sword and dagger the subtlest arbiter in all matters of honorable difficulty cried another older and grave the encomium was capped by a youth with a court air about him a most noted favorite look you of her majesty her grace liked above all things to be heard tripping italian with the gallant signor ah her grace knows a right proper man added he and smiled as one who has his reason for saying so aye aye commented mine host genially glad to see the vexed question like to be settled by wag of tongue only and master vincent was likewise a friend of my good lord of pembroke and ill tell you more interposed a raffish blade from the friars much bedizened if somewhat out at elbows one who first put a rapier in master will shakespeares hand-one wrho was himself the butcher of a silk button oh rare as mer-cutio hath it in the play captain strongitharms little fierce eye which had mellowed under something like amusement suddenly became fixed upon the doorway here come two as goodly youths he asserted into space as i have seen since i landed but body o me wrhence do our honest english lads get knowledge of these foreign antics in my time an elbow in the stomach wras the way to settle precedence if the portal wras scant for two aha now exclaimed the gallant who was of the court these same antics as you call them are as a point of honor with all scholars of our lamented master saviolo and all the more punctiliously observed by yonder pair that from the friends they were yesterday they have become rivals to-day say you so  called out eagerly a young gull from the other side of the table how so fair sir why tis the sole talk in pauls walk this morning have you never heard robert beckett and dick wyatt are by signor vincentios dying wish expressed to my lord of pembroke himself to contend for the reversion of the masters honors in the friars aye and of the mastership itself at the academy all glances were turned toward the door to gaze upon the two who had assumed so sudden an importance in the ruffling world the question of courteous precedence had been settled and the shorter of the newcomers advanced into the room with a slow step and an air of gravity that seemed to sit uneasily upon his comely sanguine countenance a goodly youth broad-shouldered sinewy his bright brown eyes seemed made to match a flashing smile master robert beckett a student at the temple-good kentish stock sir murmured mine host into strongitharms split ear and behind him sir his friend master wyatt a tall galliard commented the adventurer though less of a gentleman than your templar aye good sir assented the other still under his voice your perspicacity has hit in the gold twas a mere city prentice-till some good dame marked him for her heir and dying left him rich master vincents two best scholars sir traveler here interposed a typical pauls man with long tooth and ragged lip fixing on the veteran an aggressive stare and speaking loud as one in hopes of stirring up  the great todeseans secret thrust  the drooping spirit of fight these are the lads to take up with you for the fame of saviolos academy under the insolent look the old mans blood was fired again he struck the table with his sound hand  good lack  he cried testily  saviolo saviolo ive a surfeit of the name as the words rang out master beckett halted and faced the speaker then with measured action he unhooked his rapier and clapped it still sheathed on the table not brutally mark you but with that nice hint of declared hostility as learned in the inner room of saviolos academy where the more recondite points of honorable quarreling were studied after which he sat down in silence half facing this contemner of the revered master silence had fallen even the drawer hung in the doorway to watch progress a gleam of new appreciation appeared in the veterans solitary orb for a while he gazed upon the templar then slowly smiling raised his tankard and saluted twas right gallantly done young sir he said donlewis pacheco de narvaez -spanish pronounced with exaggerated lisp-don lewis who follows the footsteps of the great carranza mirror of cavalier perfection never put the countercheck quarrelsome with better grace you mind me of him fair youth he went on paternally hast traveled doubtless nay ill swear thou hast met him none but your castilliano say i to open a difference with the right martial scorn sir retorted beckett with some harshness giving his beaver as he spoke a bellicose dent with his knuckles i claim no travels and therefore no spanish schooling nor have i known of a brighter mirror of honorable bearing than master vincent saviolo whose loss we are lamenting why tis as the burthen of a song and this the young man interrupted of a sudden overboiling i am ready to maintain with disputation and eke with my body against any soldado or captain who will walk well crowed for a cockerel fair sir since crowing there must be yet mark me somewhat too loud at first point of quarrel hast come to the challenge already-and upon a lie circumstantial only and as for thy retort it lacks first element nor have i known say you how couldst thou know hast not traveled cockayne is fair enough-tis not the world how old are you boy thinkest thou because thou hast achieved fair london skill in thy rapier couldst already have the whole art and mystery of fence under that saucy cap- which same thou mayest as well remove at this stage lad for i will not fight thee nay then sir twere fitter not to dispute when there is no readiness to prove the retort given in a tone of doggedness was capped dryly enough aye tis easy for april to challenge december time was look you when i would have met this saviolo in proper wrangle and disputation aye i would have confuted his passes with suitable blade logic wilt fight me for thy teachers sake he stretched out his left hand as he spoke and laid it not unkindly but with some authority on master becketts arm ere the lad could fling off the touch he caught sight of the maimed stumps and reddened aye went on the old soldier resignedly  that was my dagger hand a halbert at the infall of the pamplona palisadoes tis gone fit for naught but the holding of a pipe or the ringing of a coin and without your dagger these days your rapiers best strokes in counter-time are naught to such as me your broad bilbo-he jerked his thumb toward the basket-hilt that hung behind him on the wall-is your only thigh companion plain cut and thrust and the less occasion for it the healthier for in all fighting-as one of your mastery fair sir full well knows-he who trusts long to mere defense waits but to be hit tis the onslaught wins the duello and to what manner of onslaught think you master will this timber lead me against thy lusty legs  he hoisted himself from the bench thrusting his figure into a burlesque attitude of fence and it became plain to all that his right leg was naught but a wooden stump a murmur ran through the room followed by a general shout of laughter the old man struck at the wood with the knife he was brandishing and lumbered back to his bench then after surveying the piteous makeshift for the missing limb with an air of melancholy philosophy he turned his shrewd eye once more on the youths abashed face time was he repeated between a sigh and a laugh i be now but a hulk towed into harbor at last from long journeys unfit for fresh cruises but what though a   adventure man may be no more for jaunty quarrels yet he may speak ho there thomas the drawer bring a quart of burnt sack and put me a toast in it and place it me by my young friends elbow nay sir he added with a kind of paternal authority but you shall have a nooning cup with me oh sir cried beckett and his lips trembled upon words of regret that failed to form themselves the drawer had returned with the brimming tankard the roast crab bobbing a little brown island in the frothing amber of the burnt sack the young templar seized the cup and pledging the donor with his frank glance raised the draft to his lips then removing his rapier from the table further doffed his cap with pretty deference dick wyatt who had watched his rivals behavior fruitlessly racking his brain in search of some right proper cavaliero sally of his own here followed the example if more awkwardly and sat down on the other side strongitharm looked from one to the other with benevolent interest and so you two boys are rivals for the great prize the glances of the two young men met blue eyes and brown flashed a second like blades then upon a common thought were veiled with dropped lids and both boyish faces colored deep it was the masters wish said beckett then he could not choose between us wyatt tossed his fair curls with sudden defiance  twill be a rare sight master traveler quoth he with not unbecoming arrogance trial in the friars at rapier single rapier and dagger rapier and cloak the case of rapiers on the scaffold under my lord pembrokes ordering ah and under her graces own eyes we have six months to to be ready against the match and again the young eyes met captain strongitharm cast round the table a glance of triumph in spite of the counter-interest he was at last the leader of the meeting he chuckled in his beard cleared his throat and took the lead that was his due having heard you sirs there even comes to me a regret that i knew not this master vincent it was soon after the great year of cadiz that i sailed from home god no doubt made him a good man since the youth of england loved him so greatly nathless what know you of other lands where cunning at tricks of point and edge is as common as potency at ale-potting among us what know ye of lands where the long rapier is the true staff of life for hark ye in these days your signor your don and your mounseer finds a commodity of secret foynes better equipment in a walk through the town than the best-lined pouch no gallant worth looking at that has not killed his man beyond seas every captain of fortune and eke every private gentleman if he weathers the thirtieth year unscathed must needs be indeed a master sword aye believe ir e he who would set up as a master let him have met abundance of cunning blades-not scores but hundreds more to learn every year north and south if it be not in antwerp then in milan or madrid - now where in england- i marvel greatly sir put in a gallant huffily preparing to rise  at hearing an englishman extol the foreigners valor over his countrymans the veterans eye lighted with a flash he was about to make a scathing reply but checked himself and resumed his didactic tone valor we speak of fencers skill not of the soldiers fight natural wherein who should chronicle it better than i captain strongitharm our english do excel at push of pike and swash of good backsword we speak of the duello it has rules of bearing galore-aye and surprises endless as on any chessboard and no man may say that he has encompassed them all great he may be even as your dead vincent-till a greater be found eager the circle now hung on the words none more eager than the two young rivals who had edged along the bench till they pressed the speaker on either side brown eyes sparkling white teeth flashing beckett flung a breathless question into the first pause who then most experienced captain since-dropping his voice in melancholy loyalty-since our vincent is no more reckon you the true master of these days the fine old wreck of venture was now fully launched upon the waters of garrulity he turned his single eye toward the rafters as if he could see painted thereon some vivid images of memory ah who shall say he went on with gusto  not i till i have seen all those who  the great todescans secret thrust  would be called masters brought together in one pit and matched as cocks are in battle royal aye the talk is now of the peerless narvaez of madrid yet have i known others as magnificently spoke of there is petty jean the burgonian look you- and the seigneur st didier of provence and we hear of caizo the neapolitan and tappa milanese-and of mynheer joachim best famed as the great almayne -and i have known meister eisenkopf alias mastro capoferro of bologna-a valiant valiant they are all valiant as cocks on their own ground ever when i hear of a new mighty peck-and-spur i marvel what would happen of the last could they both meet on the same dunghill i knew one especially of late-and body o me-were i a youth again with limbs and eyes and blood fit for prowess were i one of those that are ever readier with proof by stoccado than with word argument with slap of cloak at the face than with sweep of plumed hat- he struck beckett on the shoulder with the mutilated hand in friendly mockery to emphasize his words and at the same time not to leave the eager boy on the right out of his amenity gave wyatt a sly thrust of his wooden leg under the table then he proceeded were i one of your wild cats say i tis not to don lewis nor to thibault of antwerp nor yet to cavalcabo of rome that i would hie me -though cavalcabo was a man ere he was slit to the heart by one fabricius a danish gentleman all about a matter of wager in fencing argument to none of these but to one like maistre todescan of geneva now it was singular to note how at this point both the scholars flung a furtive glance toward each other arrested midway and modestly drooped again upon their can singular too the abstract air they assumed and the tone of indifference in which dick wyatt presently asked and what countryman was he worthy captain the veteran who lost in fond introspection had been twirling his tankard to stir up the last drop of sugar tilted it finally smacked his lips and was off would i could say of such a man-queller he is an englishman but no they call him todescan ho ho i once met a corporal in piedmont they called espingola who was the longsword man of a german  company now-an he and my todescan were not within the same skin-but tis no part of an old soldiers work to rake up tales so todescan from provence and a huguenot-let him have it so i say anyhow he is a great man in geneva provost-of-arms trainer of the town companies accepted citizen    aye aye those long-head burghers ever thinking of their ravening neighbors in the mountains of savoy have gaged the worth of such a man espingola was a good rogue stuffed with fighting tricks as a brush is with bristles and the simplest of them worth a jews eye    todescan sings psalms hath no variety in his swearing and holds an even prospect of not dying in his boots after all and the youth of geneva sucks knowledge out of him as a weasel sucks an egg but added the speaker slyly as he marked the changing visage of the young templar rest ye merry masters they are little likely to cross the silver sea to contest it with saviolos scholars for the succession of saviolos honors beckett rose suddenly i cry you mercy captain he said taking up his rapier from the wall and slinging it briskly back to its carriages as if moved by a mighty haste i wrould we could invite you to a friendly bout on the scaffold but since it can not be-bellona having marked you too often for her owrn-wrhy then give you good den signor strongitharm the captain rose upon his stump made an elaborate congee and stood with good-humored mien watching the young man salute his comrade and stride out of the door in right dapper deportment when the last inch of the smartly cocked rapier scabbard neatly draping a fold of the cloak had disappeared round the corner he himself called for his bilbo and cape and as he flung the patched folds with noble gesture about his old shoulders he found dick wyatt at his elbow ah fare ye well young sir said he genially shall ye take advice then till your locks are blanched and rare like these never believe you have that skill not only in your rapier play but in any art military which is not some day to be caught in a trap now i mind me being in genoa the year of the great barbary sailing there was mighty talk of a new-fangle kind of fire-pot and-  adventure  but nay good captain let me entreat you yet to one moment more of rapier-talk an it please you i would fain attend you on your walk home and as the clank of the lusty young spurred heel presently rang out past the open windows of the tavern punctuated by the thud of the voyagers wooden stump on the cobblestones of fleet lane the lingerers within the room could hear a boyish voice tammering upon the outlandish name todescan-todescan of geneva-todescan of geneva ii thou art a traitor and a miscreant too good to be so and too bad to live    with a foul traitors name stuff i thy throat   what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove shakespeare richard ii it was the eleventh of december by english reckoning-the twenty-second according to the new gregorian calendar used in foreign lands-that dick wyatt at a turning of the road by the elbow of a hill came in sight of the goal of his three months journeying reining in his nag he gazed there was geneva it rose in the distance from the plain severe within its bastioned walls a few spires faintly gilt by the parting rays of the sun fast sinking behind the farther chain of low hills there was something in the spring of the cathedral on its eminence above the black clustering roofs which brought back to his mind with a transient pang of yearning the outline of pauls on ludgate heights away in far england in the forefront the rhone bounded and roared foaming in its southward race beyond the grim city spread the dark waters and the silence of lake leman beyond again through the clear frosty air against a darkening sky towered the still gold and rosy snows of savoy the sight impressive enough was specially welcome at the end of a days ride through bitter weather and sore rough ways as the traveler gazed with eyes of satisfaction not unmixed with awe a distant boom rolled through the still air many experiences had dick wyatt gone through since he had left his peaceful island among others the disastrous one of closed town-gates at fall of night he spurred his tired mount therefore and it wras with but a few minutes to spare that he reached the porte de cornevin and found himself inside the staid stronghold of calvinism before being granted free entrance he wras suspiciously questioned by the sergeant of the burgher guard on his character religion and the purpose of his journeying-an examination which he passed with some difficulty for french was still unready to his tongue so soon however as it transpired that his business was with one maitre todescan the sour visage relaxed he was not only admitted but sped on-any friend of worthy master todescan provost of the town companies must be welcome in geneva and so all in the uncertain light of a wintry orange afterglow the last comer to the town found his way through the winding streets past the old castle of st ger-vais by the pont aux mariniers over the thundering rhone as it rushes out of the lake across the isle towrard the steep rising grand rue wherein-so had said the burgher sergeant-dwelt the great provost-at-arms at the sign of the roy david just a pistol-shot short of st germain church dick wyatt after the manner of men haunted by a fixed purpose paid little heed to aught but what fell in with the main tenor of his thoughts he marveled not at the prosperity of the noble free city at the orderly sober throng the breath of peace that pervaded the place-unlike those airs of furtive merriment snatched between spells of disaster which marked the wrar-ridden towns he had recently passed through he took scarce note of the houses wondrous tall showing at almost every floor a glow of fire or lamp that met you like a smile of welcome but rather he marveled how a man of martial renown such as the great todescan could find congenial dwelling among people where psalming and grave converse rather than the ringing of spurs and the cocking of beavers seemed the chief assertion of manliness and it made his heart leap for all his weariness as he halted at length before the roy david suddenly to hear above the bustle of a hostelry at supper-time the rousing clank of iron the stamp of foot the sharp cries which tell of the fencing hour the sounds proceeded from a rowr of windows on the first floor lighted redly and wide open in spite of the great cold  so todescan at last   with an eager presentiment of all that he the great todescans secret thrust  -well-prepared scholar if ever there was one-was soon to learn under those projecting gables dick wyatt entered the inn little did he dream how fast his knowledge would grow that very night mine host of the roy david appraised the newcomer with one look of an experienced eye aye-faith there is still accommodation though my house is all but full and you would have speech with master todescan and faith i thought as much though what there is in our todescan that you all should thus-and another englishman too but i for one have no call to grumble    and i may make bold to guess further my gentleman that you desire speech of todescan even before sight of supper eh said i truly and without more ado the traveler was conducted up a winding stairway to the door of the fencing-room twas a long low beam-ceiled gallery covering the whole depth of the house from high street to back lane lit with four oil lamps bare of all furniture but for a couple of forms and an arm-rack in the corner the last lesson of the day was over a heavy-looking youth had just drawn on his doublet and was adjusting its points ever and anon wiping his face and the back of his neck spite the icy blast pouring through the windows  maitre todescan cried mine host from the threshold all professional cheeriness again i bring an english admirer-one too mark you that can not wait another hour before saluting you what a man you are aha no doubt you would as usual partake of supper together i leave you but the time to toss that basket of trout into the pan and to carbonade a rib of that veal-say i well aye and a pitcher of the white wine of morges-eh i know i know without waiting for reply he retired leaving dick wyatt face to face with his great man the first impression was curiously unpleasant and dick was seized with an unexpected revulsion-a sense of resentment as against something unnatural every master of the blade he had known in his days ruffian at heart though he might be had borne about him the note of joviality but here was a saturnine visage with a vengeance  an unformed thought quickly took possession of the englishmans mind in practise with such a one cunning strokes of fence would assume a new purpose would savor more of cruelty and treachery than of skill as a fact maitre todescans face displayed anything but cordiality at that moment it was with the air of him who finds his time trespassed upon at a decidedly inopportune moment that he turned upon the visitor looking deeply at him with an engaging glibness cultivated on repeated occasions the youth fell to explaining his presence for a while todescan listened in silence then suddenly seemed to make up his mind to more graciousness a smile found its way to his lips without however reaching the eyes that remained filled as with some dark and absorbing speculation he was honored he would-on the morrow-offer his humble services to the gentleman now he must go forth he had charge to-night of the burgher guards watch but to-morrow  he bowed there came a furtive look into the close-set eyes it was happy for the stranger that he had just saved the hour of the setting of the watch the days were of the shortest had he encountered any noticeable experience on his approach to geneva which road had his been from the bern side ah from the north he stood musing for a moment well he must even crave the young masters leave- until the morrow he spoke with a conscious air which betrayed the tardy grafting of courtly manners upon an original stock of camp brutality and dick wyatt escorted down-stairs politely but firmly shaken off at the kitchen door as he watched the fencing-master wrap himself up scientifically in his great cloak and stride out into the night had a fantastic impression as one who has just passed by an unknown personal danger in some dudgeon with lingering regrets for the merry taverns of pauls chains oh how far they seemed he consumed his trout and drank his thin wine by himself and soon after the melancholy drone of curfew having sounded from a neighboring tower he wended his way dejectedly to the bare and very cold room allotted to him just below the eaves but under the combined influence of bodily chill overfatigue and mental annoyance it seemed as though the soothing of sleep  adventure were not to be granted that night after a few hours of angry tossing the youth made up his mind to defy the curfew laws struck the flint and once more lit the small length of tallow allotted to him geneva at last    three months since he had started from england but a few days after that tavern meeting which had fired his young blood and throughout the burden of his thoughts had been todescan- todescan of geneva a long and tedious way it had been with more than one unpleasant adventure laid by the heels at cologne through some pernicious fever hindered almost at every step by his ignorance of tongues of travel    but the goal was reached geneva at last wrapped in his traveling-cloak he began to rehearse the tale of his fencing knowledge in preparation of the morrows ordeal when he should face foiled rapier in hand the king of them all as captain strongitharm had dubbed this todescan of geneva after the manner of men enamored living in dreams of their lady of poets haunted by rhymes and lilts and metaphors of misers with thoughts ever circling round their treasures madmen all in their degree so this youth on whom the meretricious newfangled rapier had cast her spell had grown mad-mad as any lover rhymester or har-pagon fencing-mad even as the martius portrayed by marston no uncommon occurrence about these years not of ladys eyebrows or instep not of dimples by rosy lips ran his fevered thoughts but of nattiest tricks with edge and point of undiscovered wards of the swift blades and of the deadly masters of swordland the few inches of candle supplied by the roy david came abruptly to an end the long unsnuffed wick collapsed drowned its flame with a sizzle and left him once more in darkness dick wyatt was in that state of nocturnal lucidity of mind in which it seems verily as if sleep would never be known again in life he remained as he was sitting up in bed gazing at some particular bright star that between two gables peered into the blackness of his room in time the star progressed out of sight and he had nothing left but to hearken to the all-pervading silence that singular silence of an enclosed town buried in slumber on a night of frost when not even a prowling animal is about into the stillness the tower-cloclc of a neighboring church dropped the stroke of one the grave note reverberated with an odd emphasis the pulsing vibrations hung lingering upon the air as if in warning strangely the reminder of the hour appeared to break a spell at first to the musing listener it was only as if that sense of death-like hush had departed true he could hear nothing yet he felt as if in the world around were sounds that ought to be heard presently he realized that there was indeed something astir under the silent scintillation of the stars filled with an unaccountable sense of surprise he sprang out of bed and standing tiptoe in the darkness strained his ear to catch he knew not what a moment later he had pushed open the casement and thrust his head into the cold night a rumor without very faint intermittent indefinable into the midst of it suddenly springing human sounds a sharp cry pain or rage a call and then a shot harquebus or pistol another silence again and now a clang that made the woodwork rattle all was as clear to his minds eye as if he saw a culverin on the rampart had spoken it was fight it was a dead-of-night assault on the sleeping town the news began to pour like water from open sluices through the main ways drums sharp and panting ran north and west checkering the night one came drubbing up the high street and dick bent out of his window to peer down nothing to be seen but a denser shadow in the dark a faint whiteness-the skin of the drum but out of the murk rose the cry thrown out between the taps strangled words from a throat out of all breath to arms to arms i to the tertasse- the gate is taken the savoyards right and left casements clattered back heads were thrust forth with much exchange of exclamation half-dressed men many in naught but shoes and shirts came hastening out of their houses halbert or matchlock in hand feverishly concerting as they scurried toward the west ramparts whence the clamor upwelled and presently over all the great bell of the cathedral threw the clang and drone of the tocsin lamentable making the windows the very rafters shiver as if with terror in the dark some new treachery of the ever-treach-erous ligue party-the ferocious mercenaries of the duke of savoy the sack of the town    twas a fearsome the great todescans secret thrust  thing to contemplate-les savoyards awestruck voices cried the tidings from window to window dick wyatt understood but one thing and a new spirit awoke in him he thrust his feet into his list shoes-no time to pull on long boots-buckled his sword over a still unfastened doublet and groped his way down the black stairs into the street the house door was open his host loading a harquebus on the steps by the light of a lantern which the half-clad handmaid held up shouted something to him as he passed out-something he could not understand he found himself swiftly caught by the ever-increasing stream flowing toward the lower town men moved like shadows here and there a lantern made a narrow circle of light more shirts vaguely white in the all but complete darkness were to be met than doublets or cloaks many a foot went bare to save that priceless minute of time at the rampart that might decide between success or massacre with jaws firmly set on the thought of the coming death-struggle aye and on the thought of children and women none found breath to spare for words a halt was called at last at the entrance squat thick-pillared of some monstrous cavern-or so it seemed to dick pungent into the crisp air spread the smell of apples onions straw    ah the market hall a man sprang into the midst of them out of the black his voice rang a soldiers voice accustomed to command back to the bastion de rive every man every man i say the attack at the tertasse is but a feint the enemy is at the rive gate that is where men are wanted back he ran flinging out his arms and the whole posse turned before him as the flock before the sheep-dog the light of a lantern fell upon a harsh thin face upon gleaming small eyes twas todescan the provost dick wyatts soul leaped to the splendid mastery of the soldier in the emergency here was the champion in his right place here the leader for him here a gorgeous chance to take his first lesson from the terrible blade upon the very spring of this elation fell a sudden chilling doubt the last of the crowd had moved lustily up the narrow street once more but todescan had stopped short and writh a stride to one side and a swift glance from right to left he had dived down an alley after a seconds hesitation moved by uneasy curiosity wyatt bounded forward in his wake found the mouth of the entry and noiselessly followed in pursuit the alley narrow winding and all but closed from the skies by overhanging eaves was pitch-dark but the rapid assured footsteps in front guided him and he was able to thread his way at a turn of the lane a vague lifting of the gloom told of a more open space and against the lighter background the black bulk of his man became perceptible a vague yet overpowering suspicion caused dick wyatt to remain concealed todescan had halted his steel cap catching the glint of starlight revealed furtive movements as of one peering and hearkening against the faintly luminous sky a crenelated outline cut high above told the nature of the place-an inner patrolway at the foot of the town walls the night all around was now alive with rumor but this spot still held silence and emptiness with a dart like a serpent todescan suddenly stooped and from under a pile of stones as far as the listener could judge dragged forth some heavy object wyatt watched held by the horrid suspicion that gripped him ever more sicken-ingly todescan was fiercely busy there came a thud as though the unknown thing that was so heavy and clanked on the cobbles as it moved were being thrust against a door and now out of the darkness danced the red sparkle of flint and steel a faint point sprang and remained aglow thereafter more sparkle and then a steady fizzle wyatt wtas no soldier but he knew the quick-match and the little hissing fire-snake whispered of dire treachery with his evil glimmer it kindled lurid understanding in his brain an unguarded postern in the ramparts a traitor behind it a petard to blow the breach the young mans blood rose in fury he drew his sword his cry rang out incoherently oh base and murderous treachery hold rogue traitor renegade rogue help there o sweet jesu the english words could be but sounds to the knave but their clamor was eloquent todescan started wheeled round his blade leaped forth the scintillation of the match cast the merest trembling gleam yet he recognized the youth and cursing him bias-  adventure phemously for an english fool opposed his headlong attack with contemptuous yet vindictive mastery for a single moment that yet seemed in its tension to pass the bounds of time as wyatt found himself under the glare- felt rather than seen-of those sinister eyes that from the first had struck a chill to his soul the full realization of his madness swept upon him he was challenging to the death the worlds greatest swordsman all his own science served but to emphasize his sense of appalling helplessness but even at the first meeting of blades the misgiving vanished his spirit rose to exaltation stimulated by the very feeling of his opponents superb authority his sword seemed to be less combated than taken possession of stimulated too by the low chuckle that todescan gave the utter scorn of it-so might a demon laugh in the dark exulting in the power of his own soul upon a singular trick of the imagination as in the flash of a vision he was once more in the old fencing-room of pauls chains in the friars-there rose the great yellow windows looking thamesward the paneled walls the hacked pillars-and there over the point of his own foiled rapier the kindly keen face of his revered master of saviolo the mirror of chivalrous courtesy hark to his voice admonitory yet encouraging   eh la point in line figlio mio ever in line and ever lower than the wrist lower-lower good lad thumb down and up with the little finger elbow out nearly straight so-and i promise thee neer a blade in the world shall surprise thy ward as if in obedience he swiftly fell into the well-practised expectant guard even as he did so there was a jerk-it was almost like an exclamation of wonder and disappointment-in the steel that pressed on his own and dick wyatt was back again fighting for his life the genevan cobblestones under his feet the glimmer of the quick-match and its steady hiss-frightful menace-warning him to haste he gripped the ground in his soft shoes a blessing it was he had not waited to don the great boots he set his teeth never for one breathing-space did the terrible long-blade release his own he felt it gliding seeking to bind fiercely caressing-the deadly spring behind a tigers crouch-felt the invincible unknown thrust ready against the first weakening and that weakening was coming apace it was all he could do to hold his opposition as a kind of spell cast by the fingers of steel and the superhuman flexibility of his opponents wrist a palsy was creeping up his outstretched arm and one twitch of relaxation he knew and he was sped now whether from the depth of his own need or whether the spirit of the master were hovering over a beloved scholar in his dire extremity-who shall say-certain it was that the very tones of saviolo were now recalling to wyatts brain a favorite axiom of the fence-school  chi para busca- chi lira tocca he who parries only seeketh he who thrusts finds it was to the youth as if a flame had been lit in his soul why wait in anguish to pariy a coming secret thrust when he could still himself strike up he sprang brain and eye wrist and nimble feet in magnificent concert to his dying day dick swore that for the instant he saw in the dark even to the dreadful grin on the face opposite to him his ear strained to the same marvel of keenness caught the sound of a catching breath-not his own exultant he thrust out went saviolos favorite botta lunga sopramano it was on the very dart of todescans stroke which leaped out like a bolt from ambush-but one splinter of a second too late todescans own pass the fierce jerky binding the incredible turn of the wrist inward the infallible estocade that was to have driven the point irremediably under the armpit and let free the overweening soul that dared oppose him in earnest there was a sinister grating of steel and the edge of the menacing blade glided harmless by wyatts side but his own rapier driven straight heart-high went home todescan caught on the start of his own lunge actually ran upon the point at any other moment the horrible ease with which his steel traversed living flesh would have sickened dick wyatt out now there was nothing but fierce leaping triumph in his blood the great gaunt figure had stopped dead-short a broken curse a groan ending in a long sigh and the provost of geneva fell at the feet of the bewildered london apprentice whose bright blade was now black to within a foot of the hilt  master vincent saviolo-have thanks  the great todescans secret thrust  cried the youth and waved the victorious weapon at the stars even as he did so a drop falling from it glittered a dreadful red in the light of the quick-match my god he called out upon a new thought flung the good sword from him and was down on his knees tearing like one possessed at the last inch of the burning rope the urgency of the peril for he had no mind to see the fruits of his great combat thrown away lent a desperate sureness to his effort in another instant he had sprung up again and was stamping the last spark under foot then he stood and breathed deeply feeling dazed almost as in a dream hemmed in by the rumors this little square under the bastion was still wrapped in stillness-a stillness that suddenly grew awful to dick as he thought of the dead man it was the first time he had sped a soul in the cant of rufflers this was his first man yonder black heap-that was he who had been todescan a name dick had never spoken but with bated breath the sight of torches bobbing at the far depth of the wall lane the sound of running steps and voices uplifted startled him from his mood with a sudden vividness he saw his own peril to be found alone with the corpse of the honored provost near the telltale petard and the remains of the quick-match he a stranger just arrived in the city without a single friend without even speech to explain or defend himself-his doom as spy traitor and murderer would be trebly sealed he hastily picked up his rapier and made a wildcat spring up the steps that led to the battlements reaching the black shelter of the platform only just in time there although prudence urged a noiseless flight along the walls to some farther quarter of the town where unnoticed he might mix with the throng he was fain to sit down and gather strength for shaking knees and laboring heart refused service he dropped on the sill of an empty gun embrasure and listened within the walls the steps and voices were drawing near the spot where the body lay outward beyond the moat stretched the fields under the starlight frogs were croaking with strange persistence all at once the lane below him was filled with new sounds exclamations hurried steps a clang as of a falling pike impelled by a desperate curiosity he crept back to the edge of the platform and looked down  luridly illumined by the glare of torches he could see a party of disheveled anxiousfaced burghers a score or so of them armed with harquebus or halbert clustered together one rushed cursing from the petard at the postern to the body of todescan another was shaking his fist upward as to some unseen enemy dick was preparing to crawl to some safer hiding-place when it was borne in upon him to his utter astonishment that the slayer of the town provost was already vindicated little french had he true but his wits were sharpened by danger and deed and by his knowledge of the truth in this matter one who seemed to be the leader of the party was speaking emphasizing his words by vindictive thumps of his clinched hand on his palm he sent us to the bastion de rives- there was no enemy there that was his treachery todescan has betrayed us- but god has avenged  and deep-mouthed thrice repeated came the words todescan the traitor dick wyatt straightened himself with a long sigh of relief yet he deemed it still best play to withdraw unseen from the neighborhood of these hard-pressed excited men stealthily he wiped his blade and in disgust flung the bloody kerchief over the wall into the ditch instantly he was struck by the singular cessation of the obtrusive frog-croaking he paused a moment wondering then as though the throwing of a kerchief had been an expected signal from the darkness without a muffled call came up the wall eh is it you at last espingolal are you ready   at once one of the words evoked the memory of old strongitharm a corporal in piedmont they called espingola-had said the old man of travels and he thrust his head through the embrasure and peered into the moat yonder in sooth huddled at the foot of the rampart-in their black armor darker shadows upon the gloom- lay a party of the savoyards boyish dick forgot his wise resolution all thoughts of safety of self-preservation evaporated he sheathed his rapier and rushed back boldly to the platforms edge ho there my men he shouted in sturdy english to the party that was even then hastily moving on here here the enemy is yonder  adventure all torches were lifted all heads looked up in astonishment he pointed and waved vehemently and summoned a scrap of their language to his tongue lennemi vennemil la-la rapidly the burghers lined the parapet those outside who had expected a secret ally to beckon from the breach were confronted by defenders stealth and silence were of no further avail the savoyards up-sprang the harquebusade began the story of the escalade of geneva has become matter of history widespread in all protestant countries has been the bitter tale of that night surprise treacherously planned in the midst of proclaimed peace and all who heard of it know how nigh the vile plan came to fruition  how narrow for one panting hour remained the margin between victorious repulse and annihilation what nameless orgies of blood lust and rapine wrere by the dukes explicit orders to follow on the shout of the city is taken once indeed that cry of terror was actually raised to strike ice-cold to many an innocent heart and no doubt it would have been justified had all the concerted measures of assailants without and confederates within come to their expected issue -of which the most pregnant was the blowing up of the forgotten little postern under the bastion de oye but as yet dick wyatt knew naught of all this toward the fourth hour of the morning when the last gun on the south walls had vomited its last shot at the retreating enemy when the savoyard army had vanished into the darkness whence it had sprung the young man sitting on a heap of rubbish exhausted dazed with fight had not yet plumbed the mystery of the nights monstrous doings he had had a glut of sword work not indeed of the subtle fencing tricks of his dreams but of furious strokes by mere fighting mans instinct all in the light of nature here falling on morion or corselet there roughly warding a push of pike the struggle was over but about him turmoil was still seething the whole town was in the street yet in the midst of the throng he wras in solitude each in the crowd was moved to exultation or thanksgiving to lament or solicitude for friend and kin but he had no friend among them none thought of dropping him a word of kindness by the light of one of those street fires that had been kindled wherever possible until the opening of the blessed eye of day he was sullenly attending to sundry slight wounds that now had begun to stiffen and smart a morose depression gathered upon him a hand wtas clapped on his shoulder why dick wyatt hast also come to geneva he had not heard the beloved tongue from a true english mouth these weary months his heart leaped he sprang up oh marvel no less a man than master beckett master beckett torn in attire and powder-stained mocking yet with a tender gleam in the eye their hands met i have looked for thee dick among the dead the maimed and the sound and here art thou at last  how now-yet you knew me not here  nay an hour ago i never dreamed of dick wyatt but down yonder at the tertasse gate where the croaking frogs were made at last to choose between jump the wall again or take our steel there wras one burgher-a tall man by the mass but yet he owed something to the timely help of my rapier  grand mercy saith he you english are rude escrimeurs thus they call a fencer dick we left one on the bastion de loye he hath little french but he drummed right heartily on the black harness of the savoyard an englishmansays i and there being no more work to do i looked for him who had little french lest he want succor or friendly word but never thinking of thee what make you from lombard street dick wyatt aye-and what make you in geneva from the temple master beckett the retort was made smiling gone was melancholy gone too was the rivalry that had burned sore in each heart against the other they stood eye in eye presently they both laughed the same thought was in their minds  so in truth they did speak of another englishman said dick  they spoke sayst thou who spoke  in todescans fence-room said wyatt gravely master beckett mused a moment when came you to geneva friend dick he asked yesterday at nightfall a great astonishment wtrit itself upon the templars countenance the great todescans secret thrust  last night plague on thee dick he went on banteringly as he marked the others enigmatic smile but thou wast in monstrous haste well-come tis fair time to go crack a quart for a morning draft or so at least twould be in london todescan he chuckled i have news for thee dick but come arm in arm they made their way to the nearest tavern and there seated at a retired table with a stoup of warm wine and a white loaf between them resumed converse twas venturesome of thee dick to come seeking knowledge so far quoth beckett you came as far methinks was the good-humored retort dick wyatt had never felt himself a match for his rival in words but at this game of friendly mockery he held to-day the highest card in reserve aye so said the templar lightly but with me the enterprise was less i have a gift of tongues-and friends in the university twas easy but since start you did twas a fault not to have started sooner-i do assure thee he added with meaning  i left on this quest it comes nigh three months since and then with gusto did he relate the story of a long pilgrimage of fence marvelous were the names falling sonorously from his tongue every master mentioned by captain strongitharm and some others to boot but it was anent his stay in this very city that he waxed most eloquent todescan traitor or no had proved the archmaster the demigod of the blade aye dick twas pity thou earnest not sooner canst scarce now learn the thunderbolt of todescan this invisible sudden death that laughs at plate or gorget canst indeed never learn it-save of course from me when the time is ripe save from you master beckett yes diccon save from me the secret died to-night todescan was killed on the walls master beckett not unnaturally attributed to disappointment the silence in which his rival received the news dick wyatt was reflectively rubbing his chin for one brief instant he had burned to cap by an obvious crushing retort his friends ill-concealed exultation but he now resolutely folded his lips upon his secret-telling himself that in becketts own phrase the time was not yet ripe since they were yet to meet in friendly contest of skill he would reserve the story of the momentous duel until the moment of victory-for of a surety on the day of trial he would be met again by this thunderbolt of todescan and how could he doubt now that he must prove victorious on the lesser as on the greater issue assuming all the air of one who knows he has been checkmated he changed the drift of the talk ill some three months later on the very morning of their return to london dick and master beckett together sought the bolt-in-tun they passed through its portals-this time with never one of your elaborate tricks of courtesy as to precedence but the taller with his arm on the others shoulder-and found the old place humming as on the day when last they had seen it with the talk of a death-a death of far other importance even than that of master vincent englands great queen had passed away ill tilled was her place by a little ungainly scot the comrades were greeted with a shout twas six months since they had been seen in ludgate queries assailed them on every side but by tacit agreement they kept their own counsel true englishmen whose prowess wtas so soon to be tested in loyal public contest they had no mind for boasting of knowledge acquired after the fashion of your tavern-haunting gull but at length so much leaked out they had been preparing each after his own fancy for the great day of my lord of pembrokes prize-playing in honor of saviolo it was beckett dropped the information -a trifle loftily perhaps from the height of his traveled experience he thought to impress his stay-at-home friends the announcement was met first by silence in wthich eyebrows were raised and glances exchanged then out broke a hubbub-banter mockery condolence poor lads these long six months preparing and here was one wtho knewt from knowledge certain that public prize-playing would never more be seen in merry england the one who knew from whitehall he spake his new majesty loathed swordsmens shows and forbade them he could not look on a blade without shudder nay  adventure if he had to knight a man he must needs avert his eyes so doing dick and the templar stared at each other were the friendly rivals glad or sorry they scarce knew dick took a deep breath and now from the head of the table-his place by rights it seemed to have become- up spoke captain strongitharm from the moment he had recognized the young men he had remained watching and listening in unwonted silence his single eye was more commanding than ever he tapped the table with his two fingers and there fell a stillness in the room he spoke of kings and of her who was gone of mary of scotland and of many instances he had known at home and abroad of men like the new king james her son frighted for life before their birth by a womans terror then from jamies horror of a drawn blade came he to talk of fight and prize-playing and the like-thence to his darling theme the great masters of the sword alive or dead aye young masters you may have had your snippets of travel but had ye known the tall men the great days there was cavalcabo mark you the mighty italian but he is dust now the nearest to him in subtilty was eisenkopf of mainz in the palatinate he for all his high-dutch name was from the south also capoferro was he  now the eisenkopf had a certain thrust he called pigliajilo-- i know the trick said beckett over his can captain strongitharm raised an eyebrow yet to my mind he went on unheeding neer so great a man at the rapier- that is for the single duello-as petty jean in paris he it was devised the botte de nevers-  aye -from the templar again  petty john taught it well but he teaches at lyons now the captains eye rolled a little redly upon the fair cool youth twasscarce wholesome for one of so few years to know so much to be so sure of speech he must be set down ha but only when a man has measured blades with thibault of antwerp thibault the heritor of carranzas own science all by mathematical logic squares and tangents to the circumference-he kept his eye severely upon beckett as the young man showed signs of opening his mouth again-or eke with meister joachim of strasburg on the rhine whose lesson was rhythmic and required for its mastery the lilt of fife and taber-i mind me of a plaguy round-cut he would engineer on your extended arm that he had christened estramasson de man-chette it would do for you by neat rapier-slicing what the spanish dogs halbert did for this hand at the palisado of pamplona- saving your experience good captain interrupted beckett demurely you mistake estramasson is the sieur thibaults own device by rule geometrical i have practised both with him and with master joachim the veterans gathering testiness exploded he rapped out a parcel of rare outlandish oaths and spluttered the name of todescan todescan to his mind the very angel-the very devil of the sword who had not faced todescan of geneva knew naught of finality in fencing tode-scans noted thrust- here once again was master becketts moment to insert with pardonable pride the story of his acquired gains in far geneva he parted his lips to speak his brown eyes sparkling his frank smile flashing but subtly in a delicate insinuating voice that dropped into the brief moment of silence allowed by captain strongitharms pause for breath dick wyatt forestalled him todescan aye-of geneva and his noted thrust at the armpit on a binding of the blade thus- he made a spiral movement with his extended wrist and glanced for one instant slily at becketts amazed face todescan of geneva-twas i killed him yea  -and this was addressed more specially to captain strongitharm -ran him up to the hilts with master vincents own punta riversa  looking for trouble gemg some real stories from the life of a master adventurer k boynton editors note-captain george b boynton is not the creation of a writers imagination his exploits have many times been actionized but the man himself is real and still living though now settled in quiet city life after half a century of thrilling activity even yet more than one foreign power takes pains to keep carefully informed of his exact whereabouts for he has been one of those who as revolutionist filibuster blockade-runner counselor of south american dictators soldier of fortune has a hundred times shown himself an elusive element to be reckoned with in the great game of world-politics he has served all told under eighteen flags-in europe the west indies the caribbean north and south america the china seas-everywhere and anywhere that mankind was at war and there was promise of excitement and adventure his life has furnished much material for fiction but now for the first time captain boynton tells his own story its truth attested alike by internal evidence and affidavit and fiction pales beside it for several months adventure will publish adventures each complete in itself from the career of this master adventurer europe running the austrian blockade fter settling up with nickell on the don carlos expedition i devoted myself for a few months to legitimate commerce dividing my time between london and paris where i opened a branch of my mercantile and shipping house at  rue vivienne just before the franco-prussian war began i bought three cargoes of wines at bordeaux sent them to london and sold them later at a good profit during the brief war which ended in the capitulation of the french at sedan september   i had three ships busy with honest cargoes but i did not get a chance to do any contraband running until just before its close the austrian army was then being rearmed with an improved rifle and thousands of the old guns were stored in the arsenal at vienna nickell had bought a lot of them at a bargain but austria would not release them without a guarantee that they would not be used against germany i wras led to believe i could sell five thousand of these rifles to the committee of safety at bordeaux so i bought that number from nickell and with an order for their delivery went to triest in mylittle steamer the leckwith charles lever the novelist was then the british consul at triest where he died a year or two later on the pretense that the arms were for japan and that i would be able to establish that fact within a few days i secured the   adventure removal of the guns from vienna to the triest arsenal a few hundred yards from the dock however to get them over that short distance and then to get away with them was a problem that puzzled me i was mulling over it one day in a cafe when a maudlin young englishman who was sitting at the table with me pulled out a passport all plastered with red seals and wax in the old continental fashion the instant i saw it an inspiration seized me i became the most jovial of companions and plied the englishman with wine until he fell sound asleep then i took the passport from his pocket and hustled off to the arsenal i had been assiduously cultivating the officers there and was delighted to find in charge of the guard the young lieutenant with whom i was best acquainted i told him i would have the order for the release of the rifles within an hour and proceeded to celebrate by getting him into the same state in which i had found the convenient englishman i sent word to lorensen sailing master of the leckwith to get up a full head of steam and engaged a dozen big wagons to be at the arsenal in an hour i arrived with the wagons waved the gaudy passport in front of the young officers face and without trying to read it he told me to go ahead we made quick work of getting the boxed arms to the ship and under her hatches for the guard was changed at four oclock and my sleepy young friend would be succeeded by an officer who was sober and in his right mind we were not quite fast enough however for just as we were pulling out the new officer of the guard came running down the dock shouting that he wanted to seethe order for the release of the arms as he was well out of arms reach i made a fussy effort to hand him the passport then i opened it out and showed it to him all the while explaining that it was all right he went away shaking his head and i anticipated trouble at the fort at the entrance to the harbor at the head of the adriatic as the channel through which we had to run was narrow the fort occupied a commanding position and had high walls from the waters edge with a free bastion high up sure enough a shot whizzed across our bows immediately i swung the ship in and before they saw i was not going to come to anchor as they had supposed we were so close under the walls that they could not bring their guns to bear on us it was only a very few minutes however until they could reach us with their seaward guns and they let go at us without any delay the second shot took a bite out of the mainmast and it looked as though they had found our range and would smash us in a jiffy but the brave little ship was tearing through the water at her top speed and as she was going directly away from them was hard to hit shells splashed uncomfortably close to us for a few minutes but save for one shot that carried away some of the gingerbread work on the stern we were not struck again and were soon out of reach of anything like accurate aim the arms were rushed to bordeaux and turned over to the committee of safety only a few days before the battle of sedan i was sufficiently enthusiastic in the cause of france to land them without a proper guarantee of payment and in fact they never were paid for everything was turmoil so after waiting a few days i placed the bill for the arms with an attorney and hurried on to london en route for venezuela where i expected to find more excitement i placed the leckwith and my ships in the hands of nickell  co for charter and took the first steamer for new york south america among venezuelan revolutions the first word that reached me on my arrival in new york near the end of september  was that my wife who had sailed ahead of me was seriously ill at her old home in illinois i went to her at once and remained at her side until the end three weeks later when i returned to new york after the funeral i was greatly depressed and was in a mood for anything that offered excitement a few days later i met frank francis lay norton knowing each other by reputation we soon became friends later we became partners in some of the most gloriously exciting exploits in which i have been fortunate enough to participate norton was a natural born pirate and he looked the part he was then about forty years old five feet eight inches tall thin and wiry and possessed of remarkable looking for trouble  strength his eyes hair beard and mustache were as black as coal you could feel his eyes looking through you and would almost lose a realizing sense of what was in your mind it was not hypnotism or mental or physical dominance but he could almost read your most secret thoughts he was perfectly irreligious cynical and coldblooded under the most severe tests a slight twitching of his eyes was his only sign of excitement he was daring to the supreme degree but never foolishly reckless and i dont believe he ever experienced the sensation of fear he was too as he needed to be almost a dead-shot in off-hand firing with rifle or pistol and an expert swordsman when i first met him he was wild about the china sea where he had spent several thrilling years and made several fortunes but i had heard so much of venezuela and of guzman blanco that my heart was set on going there before i undertook to explore any other strange lands the upshot of our many discussions was that i sent norton to london to take command of the leck-with until i was ready to join him when it was agreed we should go out in the yacht to his beloved china sea after nortons departure i bought the small fore-and-aft schooner-yacht juliette fitted her out at new london conn for a six months cruise and started for bermuda to test her seaworthiness with lars loren-sen as sailing-master formerly of the leck-with and a brave and loyal norseman guzman blanco was not at st thomas so we went on to curasao always a revolutionary rendezvous and there in the latter part of december i met guzman and general pul-gar his chief of staff guzman after many exciting political and military ups and downs was planning an invasion of venezuela against the monagas faction then in power after he had studied me asked all sorts of questions and apparently satisfied himself that i could be relied on guzman told me in a general way of his plans and asked me to secure for him  old remington rifles and  cartridges and deliver them as quickly as possible at curasao some two months later i arrived at curasao where instead of guzman blanco i found general ortega who was with guzman when i first met him and seemed to be fully in ms confidence ortega handed me a note bearing what purported to be the signature of guzman which directed me to deliver the cargo at a place to be indicated by ortega and stated that payment for it would be made on my cabin table i showed the signature to two men who knew guzman well and both pronounced it genuine i had no suspicion that anything was wrong and took this precaution simply as a matter of ordinary business sense ortega directed me to deliver the cargo at tucacas point about one hundred miles west of la guayra and on arriving ortega went ashore and returned with a request that i order off the hatches and start the unloading of the cargo in my boats and then go ashore with him and get my money this was not in accord with my contract with guzman or with the note ortega had handed me but i had great confidence in guzman and did not wish to offend him as soon as the unloading was well under way i went ashore with ortega we climbed the bluff and walked half a mile inland to a mud-thatched hut before which a sentry was pacing ortega gave the countersign and we stepped inside to find general pul-gar who was chief of staff for guzman when i was introduced to him wrapped in a chin-chora and smoking in a hammock he explained evasively that he was there instead of guzman but when i asked him for my money he smiled and straightened up i told ortega to deliver that message to you he said but there is no use mincing words and i may as well tell you that you are my prisoner your cargo is being taken care of and will be put to a very different purpose from that which you expected as i have said you are my prisoner but i have an offer to make you it cant make much difference to you whether you serve guzman or me if you will join my forces i will make you a colonel and give you command of a battalion and when the revolution is over i will pay you for your rifles just as guzman agreed to do you seem to forget i replied that i have a contract with general guzman well you dont appear to be in a very good position just now to carry it out do you he asked i again inquired where guzman was but a shrug of the shoulders was the only answer i could get to questions along that line not knowing so much about venezuelan revolutions then as i did later i could not fathom  adventure this strange situation to my entire satisfaction but it was my guess that in some way pulgar had become arrayed against guzman and it turned out that i was right i told pulgar that i would give him an answer in the morning and spent the night with ortega under guard i tried to draw him out but evidently according to orders he would not even talk about the weather  at sunrise we went to see pulgar when asked for my decision i inquired what the result would be if his revolution failed then i am sorry my dear captain but you will lose your cargo while i will lose my life which is of infinitely more importance to me but the revolution will not fail he vehemently declared as though impressed by his confidence i announced that i would accept his offer with a mental reservation to escape at the first opportunity for i did not propose to fight against guzman that is excellent he said with the suggestion of a bow after coffee i went with him to inspect his troops he had about  men many of whom were already armed with the rifles i had brought in and they were strung across the narrow arm of the peninsula in a line almost as ragged as their clothes i was formally given command of a battalion of  men and an indian servant who i afterward found had orders to shoot me if i attempted to escape was assigned to me i accompanied pulgar back to his headquarters where i was given an old sword and the tarnished shoulder-straps of a colonel these constituting my uniform now that you have allied yourself with my forces he then said you will have no use for your ship you will therefore write a note to the officer in charge directing him to proceed to curasao and await orders she will be safe there and with a quizzical smile you will be safe here as there was nothing else for me to do i complied with it at once it was cutting off my one only forlorn hope of rescue but the adventure was getting into my blood and to tell the truth i rather liked the idea of being left to my own resources amid such strange surroundings i had been trying for about a week to whip my lazy ignorant troops into some sort of shape when word was brought in one morning that the enemy was approaching we had no advance guard out though i had tried to induce pulgar to post one and a few minutes after the scouts had been driven in the action became general with the forces apparently about evenly matched in numbers instead of allowing me to lead my battalion pulgar ordered me to remain with him on a little knoll in the rear from which he made a pretense of directing his forces he could have accomplished much more in front for what his men needed was a leader not a director they were fighting in indian fashion with every man shooting indiscriminately from behind a tree or log and they paid no attention to commands i will say for them though that they fought hard and stubbornly but they were gradually driven back and pulgar who had a terrible temper was furious all at once the opposing troops were largely reenforced and came with a rush which quickly converted our orderly retreat into a rout pulgar cursing like a madman dashed into the disorganized mass of his liberty-loving louts with ortega and the rest of his staff at his heels i was left alone and was hesitating as to what i should do when my indian servant tugged at my trousers-leg follow me colonel he said i know where there is a boat he started off at the run and covered ground so fast that i had to gallop my horse to keep up with him he led the way to the beach near where my cargo had been landed and pushed a native boat from under a clump of mangrove trees we jumped ir and shoved off in a hurry for ortega and several of his men had just appeared on the bluff above and were making for us there were no oars in the boat but we pulled a board loose from the bottom and used it as a paddle a strong current from the east swept us clear of the peninsula and out to sea but i was not alarmed for i figured that we would soon be in the path of coasting vessels scattered rifle patter reached us for a long time indicating that my former comrades in arms were being ignominiously chased around in a way that must have been most discouraging to pulgar toward the middle of the afternoon as we were trying to work in toward the land the indian let our paddle get away from him which left us entirely at the mercy of the elements we drifted around for three days and looking for trouble  nights without so much as a glimpse of a distant sail and without an ounce of food or a mouthful of water save only such as we were able to suck out of our clothes after a providential rain the second night on the morning of the fourth day a fog lifted and close to us was a fleet of fishermen from the island of oruba twenty miles to the westward of curasao they took us to their island and after we had rested and eaten for two days a fishing-boat took us to curasao there i learned from consul faxon what had happened in venezeula guzmans plans had worked out more rapidly than he anticipated and he landed in venezuela early in february at the head of a small force but with a large army waiting for him with only slight resistance he entered caracas and proclaimed himself dictator his victory was so easily achieved and was so largely a personal one that he did not give to pulgar the reward to which he considered himself entitled and pulgar immediately started a new revolution when i told faxon how i had been imposed on and impressed into pulgars service he advised me to tell guzman the whole story i went on the next steamer which also carried a letter from faxon in which he told guzman the precautions i had taken to verify the signature to the order ortega had given me i called on guzman after i knew he had received faxons letter and was welcomed with marked cordiality tell me your whole story he said but let me assure you it is believed before it is told his face took on an ugly look when i told him how ortega had tricked me with the forged order and he interrupted me to say that he had sent an officer to curasao to await the juliette and direct me to deliver the arms at la guayra this officers failure to get to me in advance of ortega had not been satisfactorily explained and had guzman said been severely punished it was evident that he suspected collusion between his agent and ortega when i had finished guzman told me he wras surrounded by men whom he either suspected or hesitated to trust he wanted a man whom he could rely on implicitly to watch for evidences of treachery among those around him and he was kind enough to say he thought i was the man he had been looking for he asked me to remain in car- acas for an indefinite time to mix freely with his followers and ascertain who could be trusted i accepted his invitation gladly and a part of the time that i was in caracas i spent at the yellow house the residence of the president as his guest guzman was the handsomest man i have ever known tall and as straight as a sword with long black beard and dark eyes sharp as needles he was magnetic and winning to the last degree and every inch a ruler of men without the faintest notion as to what fear meant during the nearly twenty years that he was absolute ruler of venezuela his temper was the thing most dreaded through all the land i have seen grizzled generals descended from the best families of old spain turn almost white at the sign of his anger himself a pure castilian he regarded the native venezuelans as a vastly inferior race thereby furnishing another illustration of his good judgment and there was much of contempt in his attitude toward them many times when they had incurred his displeasure by a display of cowardice or some other fault i have heard him abuse a quailing crowd of the highest officers in the venezuelan army in language much more vigorous and profane than an american policeman would use to a gang of hoodlums you are not wrorth a- he would always tell them in conclusion except in proportion to the amount of foreign blood that is in you yet until the day when he was treacherously overthrown to the great loss of venezuela no criticism of his was ever resented nor was there ever a whisper of protest the people knew their master not more than ten days after my arrival in caracas guzman asked me to be in his private sala at ten oclock the next morning to meet an old friend at the appointed hour the governor of the casa publica came in with a few officers escorting none other than general vicento pulgar who had put to his service my cargo of arms pulgar was in full uniform and bore himself like a hero his manner was almost contemptuous and his expression was one of amused curiosity rather than fear guzman made him a courtly bow and extended his hand which pulgar reluctantly accepted this is an unexpected pleasure guzman said  adventure  i dare say it is to you general but here i am at your service i hope you are here as a friend  whatever general guzman desires must necessarily be accepted as an accomplished fact guzman turned to the governor and asked him the occasion for the call the governor replied that they had brought general pulgar as a prisoner of war prisoner exclaimed guzman with profound astonishment my friend general pulgar a prisoner if that is the purpose of your visit you may retire after the officers had departed guzman turned to pulgar with a more serious air you will be my guest in caracas until such time as i need you elsewhere he said i will be pleased to receive a call from you every day pulgar bowed no other parole was necessary that was guzmans way of doing things and it was well understood especially by men of intellect like pulgar no firmer hand than guzmans ever ruled but it was ordinarily encased in a velvet glove his bare hand displayed only when extreme conditions demanded was a sign of terror as pulgar was leaving he stopped and congratulated me on my safe trip to caracas i thanked him with the same politeness neither of us alluded to his seizure of my arms or to my enforced service with him pulgar and i subsequently became good friends i congratulated guzman on his diplomacy and his shrewd effort to turn a powerful enemy into a useful friend though i doubted that he would succeed if i and mygood adviser captain boynton can not pull the claws of general pulgar we will have to take the consequences he said from that i understood that i was to keep close watch on pulgar and report daily which i did everything that i saw and heard indicated that guzmans diplomacy would fail pulgar told his friends openly that while guzman seemed very friendly he was not deceived and would kill him at the first opportunity well hell have plenty of opportunity said guzman with a laugh when i reported this to him there was a reception at the yellow house a few nights later pulgar was invited and was present guzman soon found an opportunity to engage him in conversation i have already found that being president of venezuela has its objectionable features sighed guzman after they had chatted for a few minutes one has to listen to so many ridiculous tales for instance i have heard many foolish stories about you one of them being an alleged threat to kill me the first time you have a chance i dont know about the others but i did say that replied pulgar guzman shrugged his shoulders as though wearied how often he responded we say we are going to do things which we may think we will do but which we never do do whenever i get an opportunity that a gentleman can take advantage of i intend to kill you general guzman said pulgar still smiling let that be the understanding then answered guzman as he walked away without displaying the slightest concern the very next day guzman sent pulgar an invitation to come to the palace at three oclock and go driving with him contrary to his custom he ordered that no guards accompany them they had not gone a quarter of a mile when one of the front wheels came off and both of them were thrown out in a heap as they disentangled themselves pulgar drew a revolver but it was not well out of his pocket before guzman had him covered with his pistol ah you were prepared for me i see general said pulgar i am always prepared for friends and enemies alike replied guzman they put up their weapons and walked back to the palace i am sorry our ride was so short said guzman it was long enough was pulgars reply to convert an enemy into a friend in that case it has been truly delightful responded guzman they shook hands and that was the end of the pulgar revolution in the caribbean a betrayal and a vengeance had been with guzman blanco for about a year after he proclaimed himself dictator of venezuela february   when i began to grow restless again looking for trouble  this was in no sense due to any fault i had to find with guzman he had treated me with every mark of friendship and had proved time and again that i possessed his entire confidence but under his strong hand things were settling down to a humdrum and with my whole nature clamoring for a change to more strenuous scenes i put the situation up to guzman and secured his permission to go away on the promise that i would return within six months i summoned the juliette from curagao and set sail for england for the double purpose of securing a cargo of arms with which to add to the joy of living in central america and of looking up frank norton who had so well planted within me the germ of his china sea insanity that it was taking root with the good little ship heeled over to the steady trade winds that fanned my dusky cheeks lovingly as i fancied in my enthusiasm and with the waters that are nowhere else so blue murmuring a welcome back to them i was again a rover of the sea and my exultant soul joined in the lyric chorus of the rigging we stopped at st thomas that haven of thieves blacklegs and revolutionists and there i met general baez brother and minister of war to buenaventura baez the president of santo domingo and one of the most interesting characters the romantic west indies have produced it will be of interest to americans that in the latter part of  when he happened to be president instead of exile he signed two treaties with president grant one was for the cession of samana bay which probably is the most beautiful harbor in the west indies and was wanted by our navy department for years before these treaties were signed and for many years afterward the other was for the annexation of the whole island of santo domingo to the united states the people of santo domingo approved both of these conventions at an election decreed by baez in february  and held under the guns of an american warship but the united states senate refused to ratify either treaty president grant believed strongly in this annexation wherein he showed his farsightedness and a commission which he sent to the island reported in the spring of  in favor of the treaty but sentiment in the senate was decidedly against it and the measure was not pressed  the defeat of grants annexation project gave pimental and cabral an excuse for starting a new revolution and they were beginning to show their hand when i ran into general baez at st thomas he knew of my association with guzman blanco and at once approached me with a proposition that i go to santo domingo to aid his brother in the troubles he foresaw i told him that if i could get an extension of leave from guzman i would consider any practical plan that promised excitement we went on to london where i learned that norton was in the mediterranean with the leckwith impatiently carrying general cargoes i left word for him with nickell  son that i expected soon to be ready to go out east with him took on a cargo of arms and headed for costa rica wrhere i had information that a revolution was hatching against general tomaso guardia who had recently come into power for this trip i remember i took the name of captain john f kinnear we had some trouble in getting away for the british government was still dead-set against filibustering and in the hope of removing all suspicion i gave our destination as kingston jamaica though i had no idea of stopping there i gave the ship a new set of papers showing british registry and was of course flying the british flag we ran into bad weather in the caribbean and wrere forced to put in at kingston after all leaking badly the ship was so opened up in fact that she had to be recalked and have a few new planks which necessitated putting her in dry-dock and taking out our cargo i had the work hurried with all possible speed for the mail ship from england wras due in nine days after our arrival and i was fearful that she would bring an order for our detention which as a matter of fact she did as i learned years afterward when the repairs were completed the governor of the island refused to allow us to reload our cargo as he had an intimation that the ship was not what she pretended to be this hint it developed later came from jimmy donovan a sea lawyer whom i had shipped at the last minute in the hurry of getting away from london he made what is known on the sea as a pier-head jump on the fourth day i prevailed on the governor to allow us to take on our cargo but he insisted that the oo adventure ship must be held with both anchors down until further orders i decided that we would go out that night knowing me as wrell as he did lorensen laughed incredulously thinking i was joking for the channel through the harbor wras shaped like the letter s and commanded by a fort which could as he said blow us out of the water without half trying just the same i said wre are going to sea or to hell to-night all right captain but it will be to hell if i am any judge was the quiet reply of the game lorensen than whom a braver or better seaman never walked a deck during the evening he greased all of the blocks so wre could start on our problematical journey without any noise the moon went down at midnight and before it was out of sight we had one anchor up with a muffled capstan we were getting up the other when the harbor policeman came along a few bank of england notes blinded him and we got under way with two of the ships boats towing us and the tide helping us along evidently the fort had orders to look out for us but we caught them napping apparently for we were almost past it when we were hailed and ordered to stop the next minute without giving us a decent chance to heave to even had we been so inclined they whanged away at us the second shot went clear through us just below the waterway and lorensen who was with me at the wheel exclaimed grimly here we go captain but he was mistaken for in the darkness their gunnery was not up to the standard of british marksmanship for which i have a wholesome respect they kept at it hard enough but all of their shots went wild except for one that punched a hole in the port bulwarks forward though from the way the shells whistled i have no doubt our canvas would have been punctured many times had it been up we were soon under cover of the myrtle bank hotel and after that two ships protected us until we were far enough away so that only a chance shot could reach us at daylight i had the carpenter at work fixing up the little damage the fort had done us and it was well that we wrere quick about it for during the afternoon we met the old warship bellerophon we were preparing to salute her when she stopped and hove us to with a blank shot i dont think i have ever been more surprised for there wras no wireless telegraph in those days and i could not conceive how she had got word that we were suspected of filibustering while i was racking my brain for some solution of the problem lorensen ran forward leaned out over the side and came back and reported that there was a blue shirt under the bobstay that explained it for in those days it was an unwritten law in the british navy that when a sailor on a merchant ship had any pronounced complaint to make regarding either his owtn treatment or general conditions on the vessel he would hang a shirt in the chains under the bowsprit where it would not be seen by the officers unless they were looking for it as a signal to any warship they met that there was something wrong on board whenever and wherever a warship saw a shirt fluttering under the bobstay the vessel was held up and carefully investigated i suspected at once that it was jimmy donovan who had hung out the shirt and i had him bucked and gagged and stowed away in the hold then i made an entry on the log which showed that he had been left in the hospital at kingston with pernicious fever by that time the lieutenant from the bellerophon was alongside when he came aboard i assumed a look of injured innocence and profound surprise he ordered me to muster the crew aft and called for my papers to my great satisfaction he merely glanced at the certificate of registry which was forged and centered his attention on the crew-list the men answered to their names as he called them off when he came to donovan i explained that he had been taken sick at kingston and left there and produced the log which satisfied him j who among you has any complaint to make  he asked of the men there was no response and he repeated the question  dont be afraid  he encouraged them the bellerophon will protect you if you have any complaint to make step out and make it we will see that you get fair play and if necessary take you on board no one moved and after waiting some time the lieutenant turned to me with the remark that everything seemed to be all right i told him i had heard of no complaints from any of the men and asked why they had stood us up why there is a shirt out fomard he looking for trouble  explained i suggested that perhaps some of the crew had been washing hearing my remark a quick-witted fellow named bill johnson who had shipped on my first trip with the juliette stepped out and said he had wtashed his shirt that morning and hung it in the chains to dry without knowing that it meant anything ive been a sailor for a good many years but that is one signal i never heard of before he said is that true bill asked the lieutenant with what seemed like just a shade of suspicion it is sir replied bill with the steady gaze of an honest man he is a true bill all right i told the young officer as i shot the grizzled sailor a grateful look that meant a raise in wages he is the oldest man on the ship and one of the best that shirt signal is a new one on me too and i thought i knew all the signs of the sea very good sir he replied it is quite evidently a mistake he then returned to the bcllerophon which answered our salute and we squared away for costa rica my mind was free from any further fear of capture for a stiff breeze was singing over our quarter and i knew by the time the old worship could get to kingston and start after us again we would be well out of reach as soon as she was hull down i mustered the crew aft and complimented bill on his ready wit and rewarded it he was with me for a good many years of service after that and was never known by any other name than true bill i then reminded the men that in accordance with my invariable rule when running contraband i had told all of them the exact nature of our voyage before wre wrere cut of sight of land and had offered to set ashore any who did not wish to undertake it while those who stayed with me were to receive double pay and a bonus out of the profits in addition in consideration of the hazardous and strenuous nature of the trip therefore i told them the treachery of donovan has not only endangered your extra pay and bonus but also placed your freedom in jeopardy as he was one of your number i will turn him over to you for such punishment as you think his case deserves i of course reserve the right to review your verdict but i do not believe you will be too lenient with him in your judgment the crew welcomed this announcement with cheers which could not be regarded as a good omen for the traitor and a court-martial was organized with the bosn at the head of it donovan confessed when he was brought before the court whereupon it was unanimously and speedily decided that he should run the gauntlet and be marooned this verdict i approved for i believed it to be none too severe the crew prepared for the first ceremony by knotting a lot of ropes-ends and tarring them until they were as hard as iron hut flexible they then formed in a double line running the full length of the ship and as donovan ran down the middle of it they laid on so well that he was leaving a trail of blood before he tumbled in a heap at the end he was then placed in the brig and kept there until we came to a small island off the costa rican coast on which he was landed with enough water and provisions to last him a couple of weeks or more and a flag that he could use to signal any vessel coming his way there was not a great deal of travel down that way in those days and he may still be there doing a repetition of the robinson crusoe act though the island w-as not very large and the boats crew reported that they saw no goats donovan was helpless from fear and begged for mercy but that was something our cargo did not contain the arms we carried were sold to the revolutionists in costa rica being paid for partly in cash and partly in coffee which i sold at curasao from there i returned to venezuela and reported to guzman blanco after having been away only about four months after guzmans successful campaign against the rebel pulido in which i served on the staff i received another letter from baez urging me to come to santo domingo the same mail brought a letter from baez to guzman asking him to grant me leave of absence for a few months to enter his service guzman was flattered by this request and with his permission  went to santo domingo city in the spring of  on the juliette o  adventure the west indies a revolution and an escape president baez of santo domingo was short and thin and had a washed-out look as though his sldn had been faded by chemicals instead of by a three-quarters admixture of white blood he had large full eyes that were shifty and insincere he was clever but superficial cunning and treacherous had i seen him before i went to his cursed country to reorganize his army and aid in putting down the growing revolutionary sentiment i would have remained in venezuela or gone elsewhere in search of adventure for he looked a coward and provoked distrust i had heard of him only as a good fighter but that reputation i became convinced soon after my first visit to the  palace had been earned for him by ms former friends and supporters and was in no sense the work of his own sword at least so far as recent years were concerned the army was in reality not much more than an unorganized body of densely ignorant natives who as practically the only compensation for their supposed loyalty were allowed to carry guns which they did not know how to use i taught them how to march without getting in each others way how to handle their arms without shooting themselves and as much discipline as they were amenable to but i fear my efforts did not go much beyond that even though they did effect a decided improvement the revolutionary spirit seemingly having subsided with the improvement in the army i took the juliette to halifax n s in the summer of  to have her decks strengthened and mounted with rapid-fire guns we returned early in the fall to find that the smoldering revolution had burst into flame and that a large force was marching on santo domingo city the president and his brother were vehemently but vainly advising each other to be brave when i reached the palace  what shall we do what shall we do  demanded the president as i entered the door it strikes me that it might be a good scheme to fight i replied with no attempt to conceal my disgust at their attitude yes yes but where  queried the trembling chief executive go out and meet them i advised  they probably will not be looking for us as i judge that would be a departure from the established santo domingan method of warfare and we may be able to take them at a disadvantage no no urged the panic-stricken minister of war let us wait until they get into the city and then bombard them with your guns which would mean i said killing four or five of your own people to every one of the enemy i am not used to that way of fighting they told me there were about  men in the attacking force we had more than  men under arms the city had no defenses worthy the name and i insisted that the thing to do was to go outside and fight it out in the open the president who had apparently regained a little of his nerve agreed with me and against the continued objections of his brother we went out to meet the attacking army general baez commanded our center and right while i commanded our left flank with the firing of the first gun he began to give way before a force that was inferior in both numbers and discipline and fell back so rapidly that before i realized it my command was flanked and almost cut off with the sea on one side of us and the enemy on two others and rapidly closing up the fourth my men fought surprisingly well until they suddenly discovered that they were almost surrounded when they promptly went into a panic most of them dropped their guns and ran for the city with an activity that i had not dreamed they were capable of while nearly all the others in regular south american fashion about-faced and joined the rebels on the spot in a few minutes i was captured along with about a hundred men who were so numbed by fear that they could neither run nor fight and had not enough discretion to join the enemy i was furious over the cowardice of baez and put up the hardest fight i was capable of with the satisfaction of putting six or eight blacks on a permanent peace basis but with my revolver empty and my sword broken i was overwhelmed by the inky cloud general baez galloped back to the city and he and his bewildered brother the president had barely time to board a small schooner and sail for curasao before the capital was in the hands of the rebels general ganier looking for trouble  daton a tool of pimental and cabral was at once proclaimed president and hailed by the populace with the customary acclaim instead of being killed at once as i had expected i was taken to a small fort on a hill near the town where on the altogether false charge that i had fomented trouble and brought on civil war i was tried by drumhead court-martial and sentenced to be shot at sunrise the verdict was of course dictated by revenge and execution of it was delayed because they wished to gloat over me for a while this was a little the most serious predicament i had ever been in and with the idea of taking every chance that was open to me rather than with any distinct hope that it would be answered i gave the grand hailing-sign of a powerful secret order which i had joined while in caracas i thought i saw a sergeant raise his eyes but as he gave no further sign i concluded that if there had been any movement it had been one of surprise and not of recognition i was placed in a large sala with windows opening on the courtyard and blank walls on the three other sides the windows were barred and after satisfying myself that they were secure and that there was no way of escape i lay down and smoked reflecting that if my time had come there was no way of interfering with the program scheduled for the break of day the soldiers were drinking and celebrating their victory with shouts and songs which lessened in volume and vehemence as the night wore on but two sentries who paced back and forth in front of my room and met under one of the windows religiously kept sober now and then a drunken coterie would press their dirty faces against the bars to hurl at me denunciatory bursts of spanish eloquence to which i vigorously replied but these enlivening visits grew less and less frequent as the consumption of tafia rum increased along about three oclock just as i had about made up my mind that in a couple of hours i should be due to start on an indefinite exploration i heard a short scuffle at each end of the path the sentries were patrolling and a gurgling noise as though a man were choking the next moment lo-rensens voice came softly through the door are you in there captain i assured him that i was stand away from the door he said and i obeyed the order with pleasurable alacrity three blows with a log of crutch mahogany taken from a pile in the courtyard smashed in the door lorensen seized my arm and led by the sergeant who had after all recognized the sign i had made we climbed down a declivity back of the fort and made our way to the shore where two boats were waiting for us the smashing in of the door of my prison aroused the drowsy guard and we were hardly well out of the fort before there was a beating of drums and loud shouts from the few half-sober officers they finally mustered a detachment which was sent in pursuit of us but they were not in a condition to move rapidly and did not reach the shore until we were a considerable distance away from it they fired a few shots in the general direction of the sea but as we were in no danger of being hit we did not raise a gun when we got out to the juliette i heard the story of my deliverance the sergeant whose name was alexandro had understood my signal he went into the city as soon as he could get away from the fort and by persistent questioning of the natives finally ascertained that i was in command of the american ship lying in the harbor for i had not hoisted the santo domingan flag on the juliette he then rowed out to the ship and after telling lorensen what had happened through a member of the crew who could speak spanish offered to lead a rescuing party to the place where i was confined he said it would be comparatively easy to get me away as only a small body of troops had been left at the fort-the supply ot rum in the city being much larger-and they would be helpless from drink by that time lorensen being a member of the same order could well understand why a white man would take the deep personal interest in my welfare which alexandro had manifested but he was suspicious that the negro was seeking to lead him into a trap he decided however to take no chances so after warning alexandro that he would be the first man killed if he attempted any treachery he went ashore with sixteen well-armed men six of whom were left with the boats while the others proceeded to the old fort they surprised the two sen-  adventure tries at the opposite ends of their beat throttled them and as the surest means of preventing an outcry cut their throats which accounted for the gurgling noise i had heard then they broke in the door of the sala and were obliged to make enough noise to arouse the guard such are the obligations of a great secret order as soon as it was day i sailed close in and bombarded the fort where my execution was to have taken place there was a great helter-skeltering of rum-soaked braves but some did not get away and the crumbling walls buried them then we headed for venezuela after an experience that had paid me only in excitement several years later i met general baez again in murphys hotel at st thomas but did not see him until he took a good-natured shot at me the bullet smashed a pile of dishes on the arm of a waiter ten feet away from me and from the start he made possibly he is running yet around the hills back of charlotte amalia at caracas i found guzman had been elected president he was inaugurating public improvements and induced me to go upon a wonderful journey of exploration up the orinoco through the unmapped interior of venezuela after a six months river journey of  miles we reached manaos brazil on the amazon that great river and the orinoco having a common source from manaos we sailed to rio janeiro and from there to england on the elbe commanded by captain moir commander of the trent when mason and slidell were taken off on the way i wrote a full report to guzman promising to return within a few years at london i joined frank norton to start for the china sea other adventures of captain boynton will appear in the next number the flies in amber by robert duim first mentioned this story on the sourdough beach to the crowd of us miners that had landed there before the stampede the line of talk we had under way drew it out we had been arguing about that sentiment you find in the north-the miners hate of any creature with a white skin who lives domestically with an indian lots of such outcasts-squaw-men-fished and traded in the creeks about there and our oratory was bitter in a country like alaska our hard life along with the indians shiftless ease sometimes makes you think that a struggle is on to see which race will cl the flies in amber  come out on top yet we know just how good a siwash is hes a hero at facing danger has christian honesty till we corrupt him and weve all fought his battles against the blows and sneers of chechawkos our respect for him in his place is as big as our hate of him out of it for a squaws father and brothers are beasts too when a white man rules their shack the beach knew that i had been gail cressets partner and had found him in a bad way some winters before in a valley of the tordriilo mountains which rise out of the kuskokwim tundras six hundred miles inland from sourdough but no details how or why out of respect for gail and the other person concerned i had never told everything but as both wrere then out of alaska for good their interests couldnt be prejudiced by a clean breast gail at that time was a clean-skinned boy of twenty born in alaska who had taken his medicine with starving rations and wintering alone he hired out for the summer as horse-rustier to a scientific outfit going to explore the kuskokwim their cayuses fought mudholes and mosquitoes for two months till one morning in late august a pinto mare back-trailed from camp gail started to track her and though no man was cuter to the tricks of the tundra it fooled him as it has others as wise lost he was and with no gun he prowled about three weeks the yellow moss sucking away strength and courage sour blueberries cheating him with hopes of surviving till he felt he was starving not being hungry any more specks would float before his eyes which he knew wrere caribou prancing in the distance and he would wave a hand at them and laugh as a man does when hes flattered one day he came out of the timber across four miles of moss and ponds rose the foothills in a string of shiny black cones and there perched in a valley over the gray thumb of a glacier coming down from the big peaks behind was a cabin with smoke rising from it on he crawled over the stones of the river boiling out of the ice to find the shack new and fitted up for three prospectors but empty staring empty still he got at a pan of bread on a bench brewed tea and when he felt himself again explored about outside he saw footprints in the moss and followed them back along the shelf above where the glacier is just a hell of gravel cones and soon the sight of a human figure stopped him as he ran it was a woman bending over in a ragged coat in one hand she held a narrow white band in the other a thick disk always facing the ice so that gail saw only her back she walked slowly toward him from the edge of a pond every moment she stooped paying out the tape-line measuring the moss yard by yard and when she reached the boulder by his side she stood up straight and bareheaded her black hair scattered over her shoulders and shading her eyes gazed out on the glacier throwing forward an arm as if to choose some object there gail choked his wonder and remarked in his quiet way that he guessed that his carcass was the first shed ever saved the life of she dropped her reel and grewr stiff to the muscles of her neck she told him to go away get out quick but he had begun his hard luck story so she listened and lie saw the fear die away from her eyes till she cut in and said no pity here and sighed when he was done she brightened up then you must be a scientist so you can tell me how fast do glaciers move gail gave her that queer gentle smile of his and said she had him bad but that hed heard them say-nodding to his outfit down in the timber-that some glaciers move thirty feet a day some forty and faster in the middle ive been measuring she went on pointing to a boulder that hung at a ticklish angle from a cone of ice that rock out yonder was thirty feet nearer the mountain yesterday and that would mean that by next march the bodies- look y here whose bodies cut in he solemnly my husband and my father are buried in that glacier dowrn in the ice like flies in amber she told him flies in amber and im waiting here for the ice to give up its dead-until they come out at the moraine -so i can give them a decent burial i will wait forever if i must gail stared at her and whistled being such a savage then with a warmth in his heart he never felt before he seized her hand and said poor girl and asked her why the men fell in she told him how the three of them had prospected along the face of the range how flies had killed their horses forcing them to camp till snow o adventure came and they could draw enough grub on hand-sleds to reach the tanana but the day the cabin was finished the two men left her without a word she tracked them up the glacier to the edge of a crevice there the snow was all beaten down and no tracks went farther they was good friends the boy asked frowning-had had no words between them prospectors dont fall like rocks into crevices what reason had they to quit you they took no grub if theyve left you here to starve by god- no no she told him quickly theres a years grub for three in the cabin but their guns are with them bad enough without that too said gail thoughtful and you was the last seen them alive what suspicions have you she studied him awhile and answered i couldnt tell you why they went up there to die even if i knew dont ask me never never talk of this again i beg you  and she began to cry gail started to speak but she was hitting back toward the cabin and he followed her gail knew nothing of good women having seen none and with the buckskin-trousered sort that sell whisky from sled and saddle he had never improved his chances yet what you might call instinct told him that the girls weathered little face was pure and he must treat her like she was his sister he did though for a week they hardly spoke she put him off when he tried to cheer her seeming so taken up with thought of the dead she cooked and gail built himself a bed and shelter with logs and slabs left over from the dead mens carpentering he knew that before they sledded out they must live as if they were alone on the moon seeing no eyes but their own each hearing the pitch of no other voice he knew his veins were young and his blood warm that she was young too and in distress but he was the sort that thought more than he ever said and at first he fell in the ice-what she knew about it and did no more than wonder how the men wouldnt tell so as they ate or playing piquet by the slush-lamp at nights they would just remark on their tally or how low the sour- dough was in the box and if she softened as she looked across the table at gail and those high cheek-bones and that snow-tanned skin of his she never showed it by one blush nor did gail let on so he said how the widows peak on her rumpled forehead where the hair grew low seemed each day to belong to a different woman whom he must learn to know and respect and be decent to all over again he had never been in love he was only half sure what love was but what man needs to be taught so he began to be happy just thinking of the wait with her till snow came it seemed that two young ones like them couldnt help being drawn together all his life up to date became a blank-the fake stampedes hed all but died on rows with squaw-men-and he forgot the mystery why her folks died and overlooked her loyalty to them and what shed said about staying near the glacier till the bodies should come out only for fear of scurvy he would have looked forward to living there with her the long winter through though he knew that the white darkness and the dark snow and the stillness like the inside of a glacier cave arent good for the minds of two strong men but he never even saw the chance of this since with no guns and no fresh meat scurvy was sure to take them so he built sleds and snow-shoes for the trip out and hauled wood from the timber to keep the stove going meantime october had come the first snow sugared the hills melting fast so that they looked like polished jet it was a night about the middle of the month that gail saw the first sign of her sorrows letting up their hands did no more than touch over the cards after supper gail said hers burned him and she was slow in drawing back her fingers out of his and turned her head away that was all but he jumped up excited and walked up and clown the floor some photographs had been tacked in a sort of oval to the logs over the red blankets of her box-board bed one he had always noted was of a big siwash buck he stopped before them and only half knowing what was in his mind he said  good face that siwash has you think so she answered him and her voice seemed to come from miles and miles away i think so too the flies in amber  and this old white man he went on picking out the picture of an old miner with gray hair seems like an old-timer and then quite forgetting himself he was a squaw-man eh  he asked her he was my father she answered him steadily catching his eyes gail came to and hated himself trembling and all hot he thought he might as well have struck her he was clean out of his skin but all he could say was my father runs the store at hope city i never seen my mother but she was white and decent gail says that never in his life had he spoken her name before- you know his kind-their mothers are the only straight women they know theyd as soon cut off their hands as speak of them ordinarily but he had injured the girls own flesh and blood so it was up to him to lay his own as bare by way of what you might call penance what-is-a-squaw-man she asked him slowly seeing his eyes wet i only came north this spring gail thought a minute then turned his back to look at the pictures he said a monster a leper- but he didnt finish hed said enough he heard the cabin door close turning around he saw that she was gone he ran after her she stumbling like a shadow through the gravel hills of the moraine where the ice ends you know the sort of place-as if it were a piece of the world made by god with his left hand and so ugly he abandoned it like one of these big crocodiles of before the flood only more gigantic all sunk in and shriveled as if by sickness with boulders big as a house breaking through the coarse skin and soon they were swallowed up by cliffs of dirty ice where gravels rattle down into round blue ponds as they would if shot from a rifle she led him to the pot-hole where the river was bom spouting up from under the ice-foot the color of coffee fighting against boulders all polished and white that would seem to crash down when you looked at them and there she stopped in a little fringe of dead grass she stooped and leaned out over the hole you want to drown yourself gail shouted over the roar grabbing her arm and dragging her back as she was losing balance she muttered something gail didnt exactly hear but it was like some persons not mattering who or what but she loved him loved him then more distinctly yes drown myself you dont mean that he said and took her in his arms and stumbled up through the cones away from the pot-hole forgive me in the name of god forgive me begged gail setting her down for driving you to it for what i said about your father but she said no no not drown myself its not for father i-i-only wanted to see where theyd come out in march wasnt that the place  yes said he relieved but you wont never see their bodies with us hitting for the tanana over the first snow you know we have no guns and that means scurvy scurvy she muttered ill risk that ive told you ill wait for them till i die- more than ever now he thought a minute i cant leave you here alone he said you got to sled it out with me whether you want to or not hear me she hid her head in her hands and shivered youve got me at your mercy she answered spare me spare me in the name of the dead the dead is dead for good he told her all at once feeling strong and dizzy about his heart then  girl he whispered taking her hand in his i love you aready you saved my life from starving now i save yourn she struggled from him youre cursed with the hard thoughts of this land she cried  once dead always dead you think and the body doesnt matter i dont believe it he looked her in the eye  youve never wintered alone in the north hevyou he asked its hell men get a worse thing than scurvy  i will never love you she said  leave me go out alone you see never having loved before gail had never been thrown down the sting of it was new to him and he felt the smart so he said between his teeth alone in here god in his heaven cant keep us apart she cried out that she loathed him-for gail to leave her there o adventure that hurt the savage in him just too much so he struck back  you aint told me yet the whole truth about how them bodies died he said quiet-like from way down in his stomach youre the last seen them alive theres law even in this land you stay in here and scurvy or no i stay here too she saw those brown eyes of his shake and her mouth took in one long breath oh oh she gasped  you think i killed them i  then what for else did you try to drown yourself he said when i asked you about your husband she looked him in the eye and told him that he had the reason wrong and i dont mean it he laughed you know i dont but if you had killed them id love you just the same then he sobered and said itll be a devilish winter with you half crazy for these dead ones pretending your love for me is hate with me burning for you-and the cold and stillness settling on our minds god cant hold us to account for what we do but she had run away back toward the cabin from there on the moraine you can see the river twist away in tangles and small coils on its big bed where the boulders are round and white and stained with a moss thats red as blood then twist to where the woods touch the tundra and are purple like a cloud gail stood awhile then looked up the dumb ice avenue growing white and still under the night cloud and the steeples of the hills that rose clean from the black drift through air cold and heady as it is in autumn looked down on him and his heart pounded on flushing him hot with love and shame curse me for speaking that wtay he said aloud forgive me girli love you so we got to live it out the best we can and keep a hold upon ourselves but he was thinking too of that winter sky so like brass it seems you can sound it with a stone and the one cloud on it no bigger than your hand that doesnt move once in a month you dont act and think then as if you wrere on earth you dont think you are on earth the threads in your brain stretch till they break-and you dont know what you do your partner takes a spare spoonful of sugar and you flare up and maybe-wtell only listen snow fell to stay before november gail held himself in better than he anticipated and her seeming devotion to a memory defied his living love he couldnt persuade her to sled out and when he wrould ask forgiveness for calling her a murderess she fled away from him there wtas no more touching of hands things went on as before she tried to drown herself he got to be simply happy again at being in her presence over the meals and at cards it grew to be january there lay the cabin a dot in the white darkness on the dark snow the jet hills white and fluffy the hellish moraine soft and rumpled like a bedspread the pot-hole frozen as if it were a mound of slag glass clean and even the glacier swept back to the big mountains wthere it hung on cliffs that seemed to be lace from window curtains though three sheer miles high and snow whipping in smoke from the top so the cold and stillness covered them like an ocean as may be at the north pole on the planet jupiter and though the sky wras brass and from ten to three oclock the sun burned a curve through it low over the mean timber in the south gail felt no need to throw a stone at it he got todoubt all he had heard-and knew himself-of the strain of winter on your mind of sure scurvy without fresh meat though every morning he searched his legs for the stains that are its first signs and exercised regularly hauling wood often taking the girl with him living seemed to have got on a dead center of course it couldnt last it was the dead center of a boys top asleep-quietest before it breaks loose and reels crazy thats always the way with the winter madness like the skin stains it gets into you when you think its the last thing likely in the world and the longest calm leads to the fiercest outburst some telling little things happened which gail ought to have noticed and didnt first he began to worry again over why the girl had tried to kill herself then the mystery of how her folks got in the glacier kept him awrake nights-reckoning the day when theyd come out if the ice moved at the rate of thirty feet which she said once she had proved it did he would count over the few times their names had been mentioned one day while checking over the grub-sacks he saw a tag hanging the flies in amber  to each one written in a queer hand each letter straggly and separated from the next one he screwed up courage and asked her if it was her husbands writing no she answered him my fathers my husband couldnt write then he saw one bag lying apart from the others-a little sack of rice under the bench which as gail did no cooking he hadnt noticed before he started to put it with the grub-pile but she said dont leave it there why asked gail father poisoned it for killing sables she told him but-but he couldnt get any poisoned it said gail sometimes he got the idea that no bodies were in the glacier he forgot to look every day for scurvy signs and felt logy often he had a tight feeling around his head and when she spoke it seemed that they were two persons in the dark their voices coming from miles and miles though the slush-lamp was lighted their card score which ran on from day to day they grew to set too much store by and once when they argued who was ahead the girl started to cry the kick of the top was coming she would sit all day sewing buckskin when he asked her what for she said that she was making mitts for him and though he told her the dead men had left plenty she kept right on she would ask him how he liked her bread whether he wanted more fat in the beans helped him first and seemed to starve herself at last one change in her did worry him once going with the sleds down to timber he saw her scratching the inch-deep frost from the celluloid window of the cabin watching him from inside he waited behind a rock in a while she came out all muffled up and started shoeing it up the valley then out on the glacier toward where the men had gone in he said he felt that no power on earth could hold him down on the tundra he came back early some distance from the cabin he saw her rubbing out her tracks in the snow and when she sighted him she ran past into the shack hiding her head and wouldnt play cards that night but next morning he touched bedrock when he looked at his legs there was the brown splotch on the calf-scurvy that woke him up he saw that to keep alive and healthy must count more than human love and homage to the dead he seemed to be falling out of a dream he said that the love of life hit him strong and sudden as it does when youre camping on a river bar in spring and discover floods are on you but the ailment dulled him and that day he put off telling the girl about it and started for the timber again she watched him through the window frost and he hung behind the rock again she came out on snow-shoes and headed up the glacier a quick feeling took gail so fierce he couldnt choke it and he followed her up past the pond where they had first met out on the ice to where the boulder had been balanced which of course had vanished long ago she was cleaning the snow from a yellow rock full of queer square holes when he came up behind her and then she dug in the glacier as if looking for a crevice he blurted out that he had scurvy and that so must she how they must hit right out for the tanana or said gail we wont be accountable to god for what we do you aint been for several days she only trembled and closed the lids of her blue eyes  every day youve followed me she whispered hoarsely oh you are cruel cruel youre about to give in to me about ready girl he said then shouted by heaven youve got to and with that she fell all of a heap in the snow she sobbed his name his full name-gabriel and as he leaned over her she cried that she loved him that she saw now she had loved him all along was sure now that the bodies would never come out of the ice and they would leave for the tanana tomorrow he took her in his arms unwound the muffler from her face and kissed her kissed her there in the cold their lips all cold i guess-kissed her everywhere she was laughing as they shoed back to the cabin she told gail that it had been a fight all along to keep caring for the dead because she thought she ought to she said he didnt know women or he should have seen that her very coldness meant she loved him-though she didnt know it herself you fool she laughed i dont know how the next hours passed io adventure with them such happiness is no business of mine i know that such happiness isnt right for winter in the white darkness on the dark snow gail told me- oh we only talked of what was ahead of us in the world and gail was honorable so i believe him next morning he hit out early to bring kindlings from the timber for they were to travel to the tanana all above tree-line leaving the next day after he ran ahead of his sled singing the air was warmer the brass faded from the sky which was full of lambs-tail clouds in there storms are rare but terrible when they come for snow generally falls at night almost through starlight gail was thinking of the dead mens foresight in building the cabin sheltered by the hills when near the edge of a small pond a root caught a thong of his shoe so that he stumbled and fell rising to his feet he felt his hand slip over something in the snow smooth as if greased he pulled it out-a red leather blank-book or diary you might say he opened it and started to read turning from page to page soon his face lighted up the old mans journal he said aloud her fathers and then he read some entries like roan lost four hours killed a bull moose horns in velvet  chelthan away all night hunting whos chelthan he asked and then he saw another entry his eyes and hands grew stiff as ice he swore as he read it the second time i give him the pizened rice this morning bat the man smelt it ill have his life yet gail clapped the book into his pocket and hiked back to the cabin as if the devil were behind him he found the girl outside the door loading a sled and took a grip on himself i found this here down on the tundra he said breathless guess you know it too ily fathers she said quick give it here  and tried to take it from his hands i ken read the handwriting he said with a chill in his voice i see how he tried to poison sable shaking all over she asked him what right he had to read it  who a better girl he said than i who love his daughter let me have it was all she answered closing her wide eyes and holding out her hand he made no move just looked gently at her and shook his head why aint you told me in all these months girl why aint you told me last night he asked his throat filling i wouldnt hev loved you any the less we could a borne the stain together girl why aint you told me that the old man killed your husband  i didnt know she cried i wasnt sure i only suspected father hated him -yes from the day last june we ran away and were married i was waiting for the bodies to make sure-to clear my father couldnt you put two and two together said gail showing her the entries in the diary as their white breaths mingled when she had read them gail said chelthan-funny name was your husband a swede i figure it he was lured up the glacier and in the fight they both fell in she did not answer him why should your old man kill him he said gently you aint told me yet wait said the girl catching her breath wait if you love me gail- love me-dont ask me yet not till weve started on the way home he took her in his arms and carried her into the cabin not feeling how all her limbs were trembling and laid her on her bed he walked the floor a while his head down between his shoulders looking now and then at the pictures nailed there above her girl he said its all over and were saved starting to-morrow its a case of marry at the first sky-pilot-or a claim-recorders office would do eh girl she turned her back to him on the bed burying her head lets get rid of these he said leaning over her sight of them only brings to mind what has near ruined us both but now is buried and forgotten and with that he ripped the several photos including those of her father and the siwash from the logs first he tore up the father and the pieces fell on the bed into her hair but the picture of the indian stuck in his hand it turned him into stone his face grew darker than the snow outside as his lips the flies in amber  moved over and over reading what was written on the back of it chelthan my husband siwash leper he yelled grinding his teeth she rose up and stretched out her arms to him she begged him to have mercy to have mercy on her for gail to have mercy- to kill her if he must he only backed off from the bed as you might from a cage of snakes tearing the photo into little bits with his strong fingers and then ground them into the floor with his heel your old man was dead right i should have done the same he said from down in the cellar of his soul i should have killed him too she called gails name rising to seize him about the waist he shook her off the girl laughed and cried all at once how could i know youd hate-fatherd hate-me for marrying chelthan howd i know what a despised crime it is and when i first learned from father and he wouldnt speak to me of course i stood by chelthan i saw we just came in here to get rid of him but id never believe that fatherd kill him till i saw the body and then-she choked-when you told me -after id begun to love you-what- what a monster i was-of course i wanted to kill myself-in quick shame-they still had souls and were my flesh-and in love for you-so strong i hated you why didnt you kill yourself gail sneered i wish you had she looked into his eyes a minute wrhere the whites had grown bluish and bulgy and fell sobbing on his feet twisting herself about his ankles he watched her a while and then untangled his legs from her and stepped over and awtay as you might out of a quicksand i told you what you was said gail careless-like youre dirtier than any squaw-man for youre a woman keep in your pest-house here dont you follow me  she lay there her long hair spread out on the floor from the black point of her widows peak she lay still having fainted gail stopped at the door where he said that something seemed to burst inside his head girl good-by he told her very slowly i guess the madness has got me too it aint my fault now what i do either girl and he said he felt of his eyes and found them all wet he closed the door softly and sumi into his snow-shoes up to then hed held himself in now he broke loose it was snowing and in the north that change from the clear cold suffocates you he hit up the valley on the run past where he once had seen her measuring and dashed out on the glacier he didnt know where he was going nor why but he steered straight for the place where she confessed she loved him he was sure where it was but couldnt find the rock-the yellow rock covered with square holes you remember he couldnt understand either how he found his way so easily and felt so safe in the storm his mind was clear as ice he started down the glacier counting his strides out loud four five six -six feet to a step you know he must have missed the yellow rock long ago the ice couldnt have moved it so far in one day eight nine - and just then the snow boiled down from about his head and the moon jumped out bright making the mountain look like a lighted castle and there was the yellow rock about a step in front of him he calculated faster than he could help he said something like this  that rocks moved fifty feet in a day out here in the middle where the ice flows faster and weve been figuring on thirty-wrong all along at that rate it would mean the bodies- and he reckoned like lightning-the bodies should be out at the pot-hole now he cut down to the moraine wallowing through the fresh snow sliding over the gravel cliffs across the solid ponds at the frozen hill where the river had boiled up he scraped the snow from the top the ice was clear and he could look clean through it he saw the thing the siwash just as she said-like a fly in amber he lay face up an arm crooked over his head as if to wrard off a blow and the legs curved together as a dead fish rests frozen in a pond the face-gail said its teeth showed in the cat-snarl you give when a man sneaks behind you and runs cold fingers down your back but the fingers here were steel and the grin so much the happier for touching the neck was a sort of scarlet globe and l  adventure on the surface of it like a flaw in a big ruby the shiny end of a dirk handle he looked harder way down slowly coming out of the moraine was a hand a white hand stiff like it was made of ivory reaching out to the knife and blood then the storm shut in and he grabbed his head again for hewas seeing red he swore the body moved was alive and fighting to get up at him-this beast that had grafted like a fungus on the body of the girl he loved let gail at him first he must have dug with his finger-nails or knife down through the rotting ice for he remembers yanking it by the feet ripping it out of the case it fitted so nicely next he knew he was blind and choking fighting for air like a rat in a pit-crazy to rise and breathe he must trample what was under him and so fighting and stamping he struggled up through the snow youve never killed a man-no never lost your temper shot at him and missed -yes well then you know how you feel on the rebound youre as meek as you were angry as scared and pitiful as you were dancing-red and gail had the wintermadness hadnt he and a grudge that may well make a monster of a man for good he remembers sitting in the snow looking at the body and thinking now im even i done my job-the duty o my nature and the old coward stuck you from behind too you cuss poor fool you knew no better and youjooked like a good siwash -i done this for you girl for you god help me but i love you  you see gail was still mad to talk like that but could he help it ive never been in love i dont know how crazy it can make you a queer thing-love he started to crawl back to her in the cabin up out of the snow-cones he was weak as broth and the blizzard was spouting drifts cutting his neck in sheets of snow before he got to the edge of the moraine the drowsiness strangled him and he lost hold upon his head it must have been before the wjlw storm broke that i saw the light of their cabin from down on the tundra when that science outfit had reached hope city again they reported having lost gail i was working in the store for his father and so got their dog-team we knew that when gail couldnt find that outfit hed hit for the mountains and whatever of him was left would lie along the face of the hills-to be found by hitting northeast from the head of the south fork it was a bad trip alone breaking trail and two of the dogs died which is neither here nor there somehow i knew it was his cabin before i opened the door i found the girl still senseless on the floor when i brought her to it was pitiful the things she said stumbling to the window pointing out and wailing gails name i hunted an hour before i found him and was nearly all night bringing him to i try to forget the next few days before we hit out for the tanana gail and the girl would talk to me as if their hearts would break but not a word to each other i learned all- perhaps i wouldnt have acted as i did if id been wise at first they both looked like creatures hid in a cave-ive seldom seen beings farther gone from scurvy the storm cleared the third day and i shot a caribou you know how meat cleans the blood and a new face clears the foolishness from two wintering alone in the white darkness on the dark snow but no miner will tell you that all gails coarse work was foolish ought i to reconcile them i guess not gail was my partner and the living taint was still with us but maybe no degradation is too low not to have its redemption and if your hands be put to blood doing of the ugly job may win it-i dont know happiness is hard to choke when youve suffered for it each hardly moved from his sled the three weeks going out till we hit the tanana camps the first night living in the recorders tent i saw gail and her talking that was enough for me i took a job of burning up on the creeks and lit out when i came back in the spring the recorder said theyd left for down river almost at once i had never told him after the break-up the first steamer from st michaels brought me a letter i opened it before i knew it was from her perhaps i would have anyway it said that she and gail were leaving for the states for good because they couldnt face any of us in the north any more  gail seems to be losing his memory of all that happened should i remind him i cantl well if he does-but in the states they may look at things differently and sometimes i still think of gail as my partner synopsis james parrish learning of a sunken spanish treasure-ship near the straits of magellan is shanghaied by carrol and other rascals on to the shantung a trading-schooner operated by twelve chinamen and one white woman with lichee her little son they undertake the quest for the treasure and in lima peru are joined by carmen who seeks vengeance on carrol for murdering her husband and torturing her to gain the treasure partly through jerry top a half-simple native castaway the treasure is found but several of the chinamen are killed from ambush by carrol and his party who have reached the scene in the calliope parrish burns the calliope and two of the enemy are drowned to save lichee captured and threatened by carrol parrish takes his place and guides them to the treasure he escapes and his pursuer is killed by jili one of the chinamen chapter xxiii the white flag again j the hold of the shantung each in its redwood packing-case were twelve coffins of american manufacture already engraved with the names of those who were some time or other expected to occupy them your chinaman can not bear the thought of being buried at sea or permanently in a foreign land and indeed to be absolutely sure of resting one day in chinese soil he would cheerfully curtail the full measure of his days those coffins for which there were now occupants were hoisted to the deck and the afternoon was passed in soldering their leaden linings hermetically over our dead screwing down the lids and slipping the coffins again into their packing-cases the shantungs cabin was then once more made to serve as a receiving-vault and the coffins ranged lengthwise along the walls the center of the cabin being kept open as usual for meals games of cards navigation and all of its thousand and one other uses while we were carrying changs coffin into the cabin two shots were fired at us from the island one splintered diagonally into the deck and one flew wide so having stowed the bodies we got up the shantungs anchor and moved her perhaps a quarter of a mile or as far as the width of the fiord would permit farther out from the landing and also erected a flimsy screen of canvas that could be shifted from side to side according to how the ship lay on the rising or falling tide and behind which we could move about unseen the screen of course offered no obstacle to a bullet but we agreed that men with a limited supply of ammunition would not waste it on a wall of canvas in the wild hope of hitting some one who might be at a particular point behind it furthermore the added distance between us and the shore precluded the idea of any desperate man swimming off to us in the night only jerry top a native of the region who could bask naked in the midst of a drizzle with the mercury at  for all the world like a lizard in the sun could have accomplished so tremendous a feat of natation had it not been for the desperate men ashore of whom he stood in mortal terror he would i think have tried it at this time ce  adventure for the mans likes and dislikes had already turned topsy-turvy he was now as sick of ship life as formerly he had been of that on shore and he babbled continually and very lovingly of terra firma of moist hollows among the wet rocks of raw seagulls of occasional feasts upon the putrid blubber of a stranded whale he told us that he had a ton or more of whale buried on the island and that if he could not come at it soon he feared it would pass its prime the clothes too that he was made to wear aboard ship fretted him cruelly he was as sorry to remain aboard as he had been rejoiced to come early the next morning carrol presented himself on the landing bearing a white flag and after a somewhat heated discussion between jili and ah fing was brought off in the boat he carried himself with commendable bravado but it was evident that hunger pricked him and that he was really sick with the cold in his head jim said he to me that was an awful thing you did to todd dont give me the credit of it said i though i dare say it was no more than he deserved so it wasnt you he said well im glad it wasnt nice to think that a white man had done it i suppose youll be surprised to hear that ive come on an errand of mercy ah good morning lichee morning said lichee and grinned its about blake said carrol and he seated himself heavily on the deck and leaned against the mainmast excuse me-but and he smiled ruefully ive been up all night with him but we cant do anything for him ive come to ask you in common charity to take him aboard youve got medicines havent you and whisky hed have a chance here what ails the man said bessie  at shouldnt ail him  i suppose its pneumonia said carrol it began with a heavy cold and now hes delirious and burning up with fever bessie pointed to the closed door of the cabin in there mister carrol she said are five dead men who were kinder to me than brothers now you ask me to take one of the men that murdered them aboard the ship and nurse him back to health and strength ill tell you what well do for you mister carrol well take him aboard and well nurse him if he dies-well and good if he doesnt die-if he recovers- well then just as soon as hes well enough and strong enough to understand whats happening well hang him as high as he can be hoisted on the end of a rope and you can put that in your pipe and smoke it jim said carrol have you no influence among these heathen  not enough said i to turn their human natures upside down any more than my own those dead men in there were like brothers to me carrol and i can find it in my heart to think of this blakes plight with positive satisfaction god for give me its a hard world said carrol and blakes blood is on your head jim not mine i guess theres little room left on youi head for anybody elses blood mister carrol said bessie tartly and now if youve said your say i guess youd better be moving he rose to his feet staggering a little but with a show of temper all right he said all right but answer me this-where do you all come in here you are to be sure and very snug to be sure-but the treasures with us and youre no nearer to it than you were before you ever heard of it so if at any time you have any reasonable overtures just let us know carrol said i we have discussed that subject already among ourselves under two heads it was first proposed to go ashore and hunt you people down like so many quail from rock to rock from gully to gully from your first hiding-place to your last and there exterminate you but the vote went against that plan and the present idea is to leave you severely alone- carrol laughed sneeringly you better said he -to leave you severely alone i went on until one by one you have gone where blake is going and by the same road how long can you people hold on to your miserable lives-on that barren rock will the green beech stems burn even supposing that there is a dry match left among you how long can you eat raw gull if the rain holds off you will die of thirst and if the rain falls-and indeed i felt a drop not yellow men and gold  a minute ago-you are as well able to stand showers of corrosive sublimate he compressed his lips tightly but still sneering jim said he i dont know a bolder talker than yourself when youve got your friends to back you but yesterday when you were visiting us you kept a civiler and less bloodthirsty tongue in your head i crimsoned to my eyes with shame for what the man said was perfectly true but with me said he its different and among friends or enemies youll find me the same when i tell you to your faces-his face became gradually frenzied with rage-that im going to cut the heart out of every mothers son of you i mean it and as for the mothers daughters among you-ask that spanish thing there what i did to her mister carrol said bessie quietly among chinamen a white flag protects its bearer as surely as an army but the amount of honor that an outcast woman can claim is so small and valueless to her that if you dont get out of this ship in about three shakes of a lambs tail-ill fix you and ill fix you good her temper had risen and she glared into the mans face and walked slowly toward him her arms akimbo and her chin thrust sharply forward and up carrol clenched his right hand he was brave and no mistake for he must have known that he had but to strike the woman to be literally torn to pieces the next instant- and i think he meant to strike her jilis crooked knife was already flashing in his hand clean once more and sharp i sprang between bessie and carrol carrol said i certain things have been said to you that you may as well put in your pipe and smoke my god man think of todd he must have done so for his face changed on the instant from crimson to ash i guess youre right jim he said mildly a moment more and he had gone over the side and was being ferried ashore chapter xxiv terms well as the saying is we sat down to wait and felt pretty sure of our affair before carrol had stepped from the boat to  the landing the rain was once more descending in torrents you may lay it against me that i was not unduly moved with the thought of human beings succumbing inevitably to exposure and so near at hand but i was not the island and its transient inhabitants seemed very far off do you for instance when you read of a terrible famine in distant india really take the matter to heart i think not for it is only a rare and a very morbid imagination that can picture sufferings beyond the seas with sufficient vividness to be troubled by them can you not pass a city hospital with laughter and jest are you in the least affected though you fling them a thought perhaps by the sufferings that are going on within you do not hear the screams nor smell the ether nor feel the passing of souls if all the worlds death-beds and tortures came near enough you yourself would die of pain but a brick wall the roof of a house the width of a street keep you in blissful ignorance how much more then the width of a fiord and the rocky heights of an island it was harder to sit down among our own dead in the cabin to eat a meal than to think of blake in his last throes and after a meal or two that feeling of wretched discomfort passed and i grew used to leaning against changs coffin and watching a deal of fan-tan eat up my resources have i said that i was made to gamble furiously aboard the shantung alas it is so and having not a penny of my own in the world i was a constant recipient of forced loans our stakes it is true were wondrous small but the excitement was as great as among men playing for thousands at checkers and backgammon i could hold my own and i was beginning to see the inner workings of fan-tan chess however was not a contest but a series of presents from me to the adversary though i once pushed lichee very close for a rubber bessie played cards with astonishing good luck and very little skill carmen played well and unluckily but the only heavy winners among us were poor chang who was dead and lichee the child played with real genius and it was a great feather in the cap of any one who could worst him he knew every card in the pack at whist he seemed to know by intuition after a lead or two exactly what hands were held by the various players i adventure the meanings and values of cards and their combinations were far easier to him than his own baby talk english or chinese neither did he win with the unnecessary vivacity or lose with the dismalness of your amateur give the child a pack of cards and he was a jack hamlin sometimes for sport and without stakes he would play me a game of piquet announcing beforehand that he intended to cheat but watch as i might i could never catch him at it and he would half close his black sloe eyes and roar at my ignorance and stupidity for two days and nights it rained and sleeted and the wind howled and we passed the time with games and cards and conversation we even had a great candy-pull got up by carmen for lichees benefit and made a great mess in the galley boiling down molasses and pulling it till it was white sprinkling our hands with flour so that the sticky mass should not adhere and all this merry-making was to pass the time that our enemies should take in dying well now that its all over that is perhaps a horrible thought but even if we had sat in solemn rows twiddling our thumbs it would not have helped in any way and as a matter of fact while we were trying to amuse time away none of our enemies died but blake and his death had come upon him while carrol was being ferried to the shore the third day broke overcast but rainless during the night jerry top had left us being sick to death of schooner life but whether he swam off to the island or to the mainland wte never knew probably it was to the latter since it was nearer and not populated by people likely to do him harm he left the clothes with which we had supplied him lying on the deck and departed the shantung almost as naked as he had come to her-but not quite for we found that he had taken one hairbrush belonging to bessie lichees clasp-knife and a jar of strawberry jam for my part i wish him well and hope that whenever he tires of shore life he will spy a vessel in the offing and vice versa about nine oclock of the third day carrol once more waving the whiteflag was seen on the landing and on the brink of the cliffs far above him we perceived the rest of the gang kelsey brandreth and another whose name turned out to be swigot these three sat upon the edge of the cliff at a point where it was more than perpendicular and their legs hanging into space resembled three small boys on a very high wall and it seemed to me that in thus disregarding the perilous altitude they showed something of the desperation to which they must have been brought by the cold and the rain but we kept carrol a long time waiting and decided at last to bring him off to the schooner only because we had been pent up so long that we were eager for diversion even of a disagreeable nature furthermore we thought that by a close look at carrol we could estimate how long the business of waiting might be expected to endure but it was evident at first glance that carrols deposits of adipose were serving him in good stead they formed a kind of granary of reserved strength and nutrition upon which he could draw white he was --very thinner and had a grave drawn look but his eye sparkled with intelligence and determination and whatever his inmost estimate of the situation he had neither the expression nor the bearing of a beaten man he chose to present himself as the herald of the stronger party as indeed he was in one way for the treasure now as always the real sinews of war remained for the present on his side of the quarrel and he chose to be sharp with us for having kept him waiting if you hadnt sent for me when you did said he arrogantly i would have refused to treat with you at all treat with us said bessie and why not said he i am at this moment more times a millionaire in terms of bullion than any man in the world i am in a position to treat with an emperor let alone with a scrubby ships company whose only assets are a couple of stoves and a cock-roachy schooner now then i am prepared to offer you a handsome sum to land me and my friends safely in rio and in addition a handsome bonus for handling the treasure i am authorized to offer virgin gold to the amount of fifty thousand dollars and suppose said i that we refuse this munificent offer row quickly ashore and take possession of this treasure which by every ethical right belongs to us and sail away leaving you and your friends to think the matter over jim said he if youd acted on that idea a few days ago instead of sitting down yellow men and gold  to starve us out i wont deny that you could have worked it since you outnumber us two to one and have plenty of weapons but you preferred apparently not to face any active or dangerous isue and now few and weak though we are the games in our hands dont think we spent the opportunity you gave us twiddling our thumbs no sir we worked like mules and bit by bit we dug out every sliver of the treasure and most of the gems i guess and we transplanted em digging by day and carrying by night until the whole mass of it lies on the cliff yonder where the boys are sitting and dangling their legs thank you kindly said i for your trouble and it seems to me youve only saved us much time and labor but he shook his head gently and smiled pityingly in my face the advantages of our position he said softly would be obvious to any one but a nincompoop doubtless i said but you will certainly have to explain them to me why jim said he we four survivors of the late calliope are in desperate straits i admit that were half starved were chilled to the bone and though weve kept going on nerve and excitement we cant keep it up forever nor indeed for very long perhaps you think were good-tempered about the way things have gone against us from the start perhaps you think were gi inning and bearing our misfortunes like the good christians that we-arent no we re feeling pretty-savage and resentful if you want the truth if weve got to perish miserably on that damned rock well and good but our last death-rattle isnt going to enrich anybody because we intend if you people wont listen to reason to throw every grain of the treasure from the cliff into the fiord and the waters there as i know that have sounded them are a hun-hundred fathoms deep now maybe youve got a healthier view of the situation i must admit that the new turn in the affair threw us into a very considerable consternation the chinamen burst into full council all talking at once and at the top of their lungs and bessie too mingled with them haranguing almost shouting and stamping her foot what are they saying jim asked carrol  i wish i knewt said i  but whatever it is theyll come to a decision pretty quick  the hubbub ceased as suddenly as it had begun and bessie came forward as spokesman we want to know mister carrol said she about how much you think the stuff foots up to weve no scales on the island said he so its impossible to make any kind of an estimate especially of the gems but theres enough to make me and my friends feel pretty wealthy well said bessie our feeling is this we feel that your offer of fifty thousand dollars is mighty generous and we dont want to be outdone so we make you just the same offer fifty thousand dollars to be divided among the four of you and a safe passage to rio what exclaimed carrol why the stuffs worth millions and millions and you offer us fifty thousand dollars worth-when the whole of its ours-our si that for your offer he cried and he spat upon the deck mister carrol said bessie were as able to pay for our fancies as you are you may take this offer or leave it and youve got five minutes to make up your mind take it and well keep our end of the contract faithfully leave it and by the living god five minutes from now the boys go ashore to hunt down those friends of yours from their perch if they chuck the treasure overboard well and good theyve got sand but i think mister carrol theyll run like whipped sheep jili-ah fing-ho lee-get your guns out boys and get a bead on those black birds on the cliff yonder the chinamen sprang to the work and poking their rifles here and there through the canvas screen that had been rigged to keep our actions hidden prepared to make it hot for the men on the cliff who in utter ignorance of what was brewing continued to kick their legs idly in space carrol sprang to his feet livid is this how you respect a flag of truce he cried  may god strike me dead theres no decency left among men mister carrol cried bessie the flag affects only you nobodys raising a hand against you as for those skunks up yonder -theres nothing to protect them except the long range-four-five-six hundred yards i adventure i call it-and that wont cover them long its murder carrol screamed this at the top of his voice hoping i think to warn his friends but if his cry did reach them it passed unheeded try that again said bessie and well call the truce off-and youll last about five seconds now then my buck take our proposition or leave it but i cant said carrol resolutely without consulting with my friends im only one vote among four oh well said bessie if thats all the influence youve got up yonder and you the boss the fount of wisdom i guess wed better open fire and have done with the business she turned to the chinamen jili- she said hold on said carrol you guarantee us fifty thousand and a safe passage to rio fifty thousand said bessie and a safe passage-unless you try any dirty work carrols face was a study resolute villain i think he was capable of flinging the offer in our faces and dying a martyr to his own stubbornness but it must be that at this moment the inklings of some future desperate plan came to him for suddenly and with considerable meekness i accept said he for myself and for my friends well and good said bessie and now said he put me ashore and ill tell the boys for answer bessie fetched the megaphone and thrust it into his hands from the moment you accepted the proposition said she were responsible for your safe passage to rio and were not going to let you run the risk of going ashore now then phone those men that youve made a satisfactory arrangement-you neednt state the terms or you might get yourself prematurely disliked tell them to come at once to the landing and well send for them and by the way theyve got a rifle tell them to throw that into the fiord-so that i can see them do it carrol rolled a wicked and baleful eye but he put the megaphone presently to his mouth and gave his comrades their directions for a few moments they appeared to consult then one-kelsey it was-rose to his feet raised the rifle high above his head held it thus in full view for a second or two and flung it from him it seemed a long time falling turned over slowly and entered the water without any sound or splash that could be detected from the schooner the three men then turned and disappeared making for the head of the fissure that conducted to the landing well said carrol shrugging his broad fat shoulders thats over now for gods sake give me something to eat and a drink and let me dry out at the stove jili said bessie look after mr carrol the way in which jili did this must have astonished that desperate adventurer jili drove into the mans brawny legs jerked them from under him and pitched him heavily upon the deck then falling upon him with ropes ah fing and ho lee had in a moment so bound him that he could move no more than his fingers and toes look in his hip-pocket said bessie i thought so a sawed-off colt take the cartridges out of it and give it to lichee to play with take that knife too that he wears in his belt he sports that so openly that i guess hes got another hidden find that it was as bessie said the man had a second knife in reserve and his face became apoplectic with fury when this last resource was taken from him foam appeared on his lips and rolling his head until he could see bessie -your soul to - he cried you - you - you - jili said bessie if that sewer of a mouth starts to run again get your sail-needle and take a couple of stitches in it carrol i said ive enough humanity in me to advise you to be careful youve spoken as a man has no right to speak to a woman were she satans mother try it again and your lips will be sewed together like the lips of a wound the stitches to be taken out at meal-time behave yourself and you will be treated reasonably well he made no answer at all and presently was carried into the galley placed near the stove to dry and fed by hand like a baby not long afterward kelsey brandreth and swigot came over the side and three more forlorn meek spiritless sheep i have never had the pleasure to see and they took to the idea of being bound with ropes as peacefully as tired men take to soft beds at the close of the long day two small penknives one vicious clasp- yellow men and gold  knife and a revolver whose mainspring turned out to be broken were found about them and in kelseys watch-pocket a small bottle labeled spirits of lavender bessie was about to heave this overboard but carmen begged for it saying that it was a well-known and harmless remedy for insomnia and that she stood in great need of something of the kind i think she spoke in good faith but said bessie how do you know its what the label says carmen uncorked the bottle and sniffed at the contents then broke suddenly into one of her rare and animated smiles you tell by that-a smell said she and she recorked the bottle and thrust it into her bosom  its my hands she said nodding brightly they keep-a me awake they have a what-you-call-him rheumatism i suggested and she nodded its this cold damp climate i said you poor soul yes she said here it is too fraish for my poor bone chapter xxv carmen gives advice how often during the next days of appalling labor for all hands did i envy carrol kelsey brandreth and swigot in comfortable bondage each with a pillow to his head reclining in the warm galley and resting from wickedness standing and contemplating the great mass of treasure on the cliff for the first time was i think the most delightful and thrilling occupation upon which i was ever engaged and i could have spent a month turning over the pieces admiring this admirable golden bowl battered as it was or piecing together the ancient peruvian wainscoting and laying it in order like the parts of a picture-puzzle upon some level space of sand or i could have looked by the hour into the heart of one ice-green emerald and by the hour into the heart of the next or i could turn away from the glistening tarnished heap losing my vision in the distances of the snow-capped mountains and flying hand in hand with the imagination to the active centers of civilization there to see myself play the nabob the philanthropist the friend of the poor my yacht should be white and tall upon the blue waters of long island sound my houses should stand wherever skies are bluest and nature is most grateful to the helping hand i imagined in terms of hundred-acre lawns and marble stables or better and less personally i dreamed that i should do something noble with my money of great good to the many enduring and free from taint though just what that should be i was admittedly unable to specify in short like every other natural man in this world i wanted the pleasure and the ease and the picturesqueness of great wealth without any of the labor i wanted to sit upon the cliff and play with the museum pieces of the treasure and guess the value they would bring in the market but after one hour of it exactly i did not want to be one of the pack-mules that must carry the stuff like so much coal and help store it aboard the shanking do you know that sixty pounds of gold is no easier to carry than sixty pounds of offal and is heavier upon the shoulders of a man than the whole of his sins but such is the fact and when you get under your load for the twentieth time in one day and the straps of your pannier settle themselves into the raw furrows on your shoulders and when after a heavy stumble the sixty pounds hits you a concentrated jarring bump upon the spine then indeed you begin to understand the woes of the rich and the woes of the rich are just as woful as the woes of the man who dynamites them and this having moved upon my own shoulders more than a ton of bullion in two days time i myself am prepared to certify laying if requested my right hand truthfully upon the book when at last it came to moving the silver-and this was of problematical value owing to the depths to which it was bitten by tarnish and destroyed i struck work cold as was the wind and the drizzle i stripped off my coat and shirt and instructed jili wrho ever since i had gone as an exchange for lichee had been very tender with me and thoughtful of my comfort as a committee of one to examine my shoulders he reported them unfit for work and  though at a pinch i might have carried one more load consisting of nothing less valu-  adventure able than koh-i-noors i was invalided to guard duty over our four precious rascals in the galley hitherto i had only taken my turn at this but for the whole of the last day during which we lay anchored in the fiord i kept the necessary eye on them and played the bugbear generally the four now well fed and warmed began to take life very easily and to joke with their jailors but that the least opportunity would fill them once more with the old nick was not to be doubted during that last day for instance carrol proposed if i would set them free and arm them to make me sole master of three parts of the treasure to murder the chinamen was the merest detail of the plan  and although he opened the matter jocosely i could see that he was not altogether sure as to whether i was to be tempted or not having heard him out to the end however i laughed in his face and he laughed back  you treated me so faithfully and honorably in frisco said i that i feel sure you would do the same now if i set you free all you have to do is to give your word to be believed by any one aboard this ship why man i dont believe-i honestly dont-that you ever so much as kept a promise given by yourself-to yourself suppose that yours had been the successful party how many of them would you have allowed to survive to tell the tale and ill give you others a piece of mighty good advice its this-when you go ashore at rio with your share of the fifty thousand thats to be handed over to you keep an eye on carrol here hell want the whole of it and hell get it-if you dont watch out  parrish dont think much of you do e said kelsey and i dunnos i blame im its a long rolling road to rio said brandreth cheerfully and between here and there the oceans deep and maybe well all roll on the bottom together i dreamed last night said swigot that the- ship blew up and while i was in the air the ropes that bound me burst asunder and i fell flop into the water and was just striking out for shore when i gets all tangled up in the chinks pig-tails and is dragged under on the level jim said carrol what do you think the treasures worth  well said i i toted the smallest share of anybody from the cliff to the boat and i calculate roughly that that share was about twenty-eight hundred pounds of gold-thats more than a million dollais just what i carried alone some of the boys made as many trips as i did and carried about a hundred pounds each time to my sixty then there are the emeralds and things and the good lord only knows what theyre worth when i was in the land of the free said kelsey pathetically emeralds was high u and thus we argued and estimated inini just as in a cafe four men may sit about a table and guess by the hour as to the fortune of mr vanderbilt or mr rockefeller starting upon guessed premises and arriving of course nowhere it was wonderful to see how cheerful a topic to these four men wras that of the millions that they had all but secured for themselves so every family loves to dwell upon the gold mine that should have made it rich or upon the timber lands sold at the wrong time by the unprophetic grandfather and so i fancy the civilized world over the most toothsome of all gossip where men are met together is that of un-boundable wealth and if it were not for heavy gold light women and fast horses civilized man would soon lose the use of his tongue a figure blocked the galley door and a shadow fell among us conversing carmen was on her rounds fifty times a day she would thus steal silently upon the prisoners stand a while in the frame of the door look her fill upon carrol in his fallen fortunes and steal as quietly away but on this occasion she spoke it is better she said that fat man be kill before he do mischief you think he mind them rope not so much and she snapped her distorted little fingers you keep faith with heem but nobody keep faith with me when i say i come along and not want any gol you promise me that man for myself now you not give heem me but i tell you i creep in here some fine night when nobody on the look and then i have my little fling with heem she gazed for a long time into carrols yellow men and gold  face and he went white under the stare of her great accusing stag-eyes if i not kill heem she said that ver bad when he break loose and cut your heart out you not like hear me say i tole you so that man poison just lak snake he wear that-a rope cause it suit heem but he not have to she turned and went as suddenly and as silently as she had come but her few words had blunted the edge of cheerful conversation and carrol in particular was badly scared by them i tell you he said i dont like it i was promised a safe passage to rio and i submitted to be bound i demand either that these ropes come off or that i be guarded night and day i tell you it gives me the chills to think of that revengeful hussy creeping in here some night and cutting my throat you may be quite sure said i that anything of that kind will certainly be prevented quite sures not sure enough said he well said i its the nearest sure you can be in this world and to think said he in the tone of one who has missed the short end of a hundred-to-one shot at the races that i could have killed her one time in lima just as well as not could have had the business hushed up and never need have had this hanging over me i tell you its- unpleasant not to put it stronger the next day dawned with watery sunshine and capricious breezes we got up the anchor and stood down the fiord for the open stretches of beagle channel and about ten oclock had left the scenes of our desperate adventures behind looking astern the great white blotches of the headland dwindled and ran together until they resembled once more a saucy schooner under full sail and dwindled and shrank to a spot to a pinhead and vanished at last from our eyes forever of the various emotions displayed at this time bessies was the most odd for she was moved suddenly to tears and clasped lichee to her heart and fondled him and finally pushed him away from her and ran into the cabin and sat for many hours among the coffins of the dead chapter xxvi at sea again to run out of beagle channel turn the corner so to speak and follow up the eastern coast of south america embraced but the first principles of navigation eliminating a perilous repassage of magellan or the dangerous gales and seas of cape horn we were now so rich that it mattered little in what port of the civilized world we should first anchor let it only be the nearest and easiest to reach and one from which trustworthy steamers sailed or trains ran but the troubles which such a course promised to prevent were inflicted upon us in other ways our venture was predestined to trouble where navigation should have been easy it was made difiicult by fog and in comparison to chang jili was no great sailor instead of incurring dangers on the side of boldness he incurred them by caution and procrastination and instead of feeling his way northward through the fog he stood day after day straight out to sea we weathered a very wicked fifty-hour gale that never so much as lifted a corner of the fog we came within an ace of running down an uncharted island and we sprang aleak forward which though not an actual menace obliged us to keep the pumps pretty active and when at last fine blue sea-weather put in a tardy appearance and our minds were at rest as to the ships position nature not yet ready to let us go scot free visited us with the scurvy labor that was almost unendurable and long continuance on a narrow salty and not particularly nutritious diet had its usual results especially the labor for those who had worked the hardest were the first to fall sick while those who had not worked at all escaped the passengers or prisoners continued in excellent health and spirits with the exception of carrol and whatever it was that ailed him it was not the scurvy he seemed to suffer more from general languor and loss of appetite than from anything specific and complained that his whole skeleton was outlined in aches the women had no touch of the scurvy nor had lichee and my own case of it was more in the nature of a threat than a development but the chinamen for what reason i do  adventure not know unless it was that they had endured such cruel labors displayed no power whatever to resist the disease irregular red blotches splotched their emaciated yellow faces their bones ached their gums bled depression exhaustion and a disgust of themselves marked them they were paying an awful price for riches it seemed positively wicked not to put the well men to work but it was a risk that we dared not run for the chinamen though they continued dejectedly to sail the shantung were in no condition immensely superior though they were numerically to handle a spirited mutiny with any certainty so obvious was this that kelsey brandreth and swigot begged like so many children to be freed from their bonds and put to work a dozen times a day they volunteered for work their eyes gleaming and glistening and when denied it was really comical to see how ill they bore the disappointment one thing was certain we must crack on all sail and make for the nearest fresh vegetables and to that intent we hauled our wind and steered for port pazoo in the gulf of san matias none of us had ever heard of the place it was not sure we should find there what we sought and as the saying is we were merely taking a chance on it it was the nearest named settlement that our charts gave and the wind blowing strongly and with every appearance of steadiness from the southeast had not a little to do with the decision shortly after wre had made our landfall ah fing died and was sealed in his coffin and laid by the side of his friends and comrades who had gone before but in spite of this sad ending to a cheerful useful and laborious life the effect of sighting land could not but cheer us to the marrow it looked a green fertile country and it served like some potent drug to arrest the course of the scurvy else must ah fings death have been followed by others for very sick men are often like sheep about dying together they hold out for a while then one takes the plunge and the others make haste to follow of all our ships company carrol alone was not cheered and revivified by the sight erf land for two days he had refused food and he had all the appearance of a very sick man- perhaps he realized that any desperate plan he may have formed of rising and taking the schooner at sea was over and that his game was up he spoke if at all very quietly and soberly he seemed to think there was a possibility of his dying and he was so meek as to express regret for the life he had led and the deeds he had done if he died he said he wished his share of the fifty thousand to go to a charity which he named in los angeles a charity he said that his own mother rest her soul had founded i think that in all the seven seas you could not have lighted on a more christian-spoken man in the expression of his face calm gentle and tolerant and in the quiet colorless words of his mouth with their occasional quaint sanctimonious turns he was the most vivid illustration nay illumination of that ancient saw when the devil is sick the devil a saint would be when the devil is well the devil a saint is he a pleasant human note coming as it did from so evil a man was the pathetic concern exhibited by kelsey for his fallen leader and brandreth and swigot seemed to have a real tenderness and affection for him yet god alone knows what he may ever have done to deserve it at their hands or anothers we came at last to anchor off the umbrageous little red-roofed settlement called port pazoo and learned within the next twenty minutes in the person of don philip emanuel esquada that the diminutive place maintained a customs and quarantine chapter xxvii don philip emanuel esquada there was nothing spanish about the little man but his name for he was a vermonter by birth as he made haste to explain and a dentist by education he had taken a spanish name to advance the more quickly politically and had assumed all the prerogatives of a bona fide physician a profession more lucrative in port pazoo than dentistry the little creature had a bright eye a dancing step and a prodigious mustache he was a veritable windbag for loquacity and yet a man that rang kind and honest especially to so poor a judge of physiognomy as myself yellow men and gold  youve got sick aboard said he in his quick chirping voice of a dickie-bird what ails them-scurvy ill dose em all round and send you out a boat-load of salad any other sick one case dont know what it is-eh mysterious-i see ill have a look at him were obliged to keep him in confinement doctor said i mutinous-something of that sort he interrupted i see well not that exactly and i was for giving a certain truthful if not complete account of the situation but don philip had not been born with the faculty of listening-at least to me i see-i see he said now where is he pretty woman that your wife your- no i shouted nothing of the kind   i see-i see  he said  pretty-plump - affectionate - good-natured - big eyes now about this mutineer in the galley- eh have the goodness to point him out carrol had rolled over on his face and was now moaning and breathing very heavily looks like stomach-ache - roll over my man-glarey eyes-just put out your tongue - phew white as chalk - pulse - hum hum-regular enough at the moment -but weak-very weak how long have you been feeling bad any fever thats bad ever been this way before plenty of fat left -if i know whats the matter with you my man water moaned carrol i stepped out of the galley to fetch him adipperful and when i returned the doctor was kneeling beside him and pressing his ear to him here and there as if to listen to the workings of his heart and lungs but in those few moments a change had come over both carrol and the doctor the doctors loquacity had left him and carrol had in each cheek a spot of color heres the water said i and by the lord harry doctor your man looks better already better said the doctor not much -hes not better look here - he rose from his knees and whispered in my ear its incipient yellow fever im afraid the little mans voice shook it hasnt reached the virulent contagious stage- but its on the verge did you see his tongue now you must see what arrange- ments can be made to quarantine him from the others we must put him ashore i said not much you mustnt said he what do we keep a quarantine for but said i i never heard of yellow fever coming on this way-and hanging off so long why the mans been complaining for weeks there are twenty forms of yellow fever said the doctor this is one of them and by the way if youll muster the crew ill - he seemed unaccountably agitated and i attributed this to his personal fear of taking the fever from carrol ill-he said-ill dose them all round tell them to go into the forecastle and lie down in their bunks ive some strong specific here and its best to rest after taking it it wasnt very difficult to persuade the chinamen to lie down they were very tired poor fellows sick and listless jili especially looked to be at deaths door they drank a tumbler apiece of the medicine the doctor had mixed for them made no complaint of its taste which he said they would find bitter and disagreeable and one and all turned their faces to the wall and lay like dead men now boys said the doctor that medicine will begin to burn presently but dont mind-that only shows its working now mr parrish ive mixed a glass for you too no no i said a little fresh salad will fix me theres not anything really the matter with me jili turned his face towtard us attempted to smile and rubbing his abdomen with one hand  him burn all same fire he said thats right-thats right said the doctor the more it burns now the quicker it will stop burning he seemed unduly agitated and in a great hurry to get on deck into the open air its too close for me he said down here i followed him up the ladder bessie holding lichee by one hand was waiting for us have you given them some medicine doctor she asked yes-yes he said hastily but i must ask you to make that child scarce youve a case of yellow fever aboard-the man carrol-better go into the cabin until  adventure weve made arrangements for disinfection and so forth excuse me mr parrish i must send my boat ashore for a supply of vegetables he gave an order to the men who had rowed him out and they cast loose and pushed away toward the landing now then said the doctor ill have another look at carrol   this time i did not accompany him into the galley but stood idly looking at the distant town longing to stroll about its shady streets and to eat myself sick with its fresh fruits presently i heard what sounded like a groan i turned-and saw the face of jili half out of the forecastle hatchway his chin was turned forward and up and his eyes were frightfully rolling a steady humming sound of moaning and groaning seemed to pass him coming from the forecastle and spreading into the open air jilis thin hands clutched the edge of the hatchway and he seemed to be making semi-conscious efforts to drag himself upon the deck then as i looked his head rolled farther and farther back his hands relaxed their hold and he fell suddenly out of sight i sprang into the galley to call the doctor but before i could speak his name i was thrown violently to the floor beaten about the head and bound hand and foot and chucked into a corner carrol stood over me smiling wonderful man the doctor he said cures me puts the chinks out of their pain and now look at him i heard the sounds that accompany sea-sickness and turning my head saw the little doctor bending over double and convulsed by nausea r luckily said carrol he kept his nerve until hed done the trick brandreth go and batten down the forecastle hatch the chinks ought to be quiet enough by now but you never can tell swigot you and kelsey take some of these rope-ends and make the women fast as for me- my god i eatt jim-jim he said it takes a nerve to starve yourself sick he burst out laughing and you thought i had the yellow fever did you buck up there doctor you played your part to perfection i give you a mark of ten as the boys say all this while he was ransacking the galley for food and cramming such as he found into his ravenous mouth and so jim said he you wouldnt take your medicine like a man you were so - fond of those yellow friends of yours that i thought youd like to go with them wherever theyve gone was it poison you gave them i faltered was it poison and he slapped his thighs as if an excellent joke had been passed  and what would we give them- soothing sirup  god i moaned and then i am afraid i cried a little what between horror and fear for i could not but think that my own end wras near at hand and almost i wished that i had drunk of the poison lest a worse fate befall presently kelsey poked his head in at the door kelsey sir said he to report that the ladies has been secured ah said carrol and they sent me their love i calculate well not bess sir said kelsey but little spanish-she said to say as how she was always all yours well said carrol since alls shipshape i guess we better get up the hook and make sail cheer up doctor-theres a million of gold belonging to you on this ship and that ought to be heavy enough to keep food on your stomach jim-he turned at the door dont look so silly- youll be well treated oull even have those ropes taken off when we are out of sight of land an hour later the shantung was standing once more for open sea carrol came into the galley and cut the ropes which bound me youre wanted on deck said he why said i to help throw the dead overboard said he the forecastles all cluttered up with them and sos the cabin   bessie i half asked still showing fight said he my god man youre not in love with the woman are you because if you are-well -if i dont begin to feel sorry for you when are you going to finish with me i asked why this is my plan he said in a confidential tone and youll agree its a good one were going to lay a course for rio and some time between now and landfall we shall expect you to make yourself scarce yellow men and gold -thats all god knows ive enough murders on my conscience to last me and i dont want another so jim any time you dont like your company you can either get a prescription from the doctor or-jump thank you i said and meanwhile said he you will be free daytimes to go and come as you like to eat with us and to steep your sense of the picturesque in such bacchanalian scenes as are liable to occur from time to time boys will be boys said he and now let us bury the dead chapter xxviii waiting since i was allowed to come and go as i pleased i passed the rest of the day with the women and lichee in the cabin they were no longer bound but had been forbidden the deck under pain of death it being the intention i suppose to reduce them to quiet submission by this and other bullying methods and woful as was my own perspective fate i am happy to think that at this time my thoughts were mostly for them i was to die before very long by my own hand according to carrols calculations but bessie and carmen were to furnish sport before their necks were wrung for them and dreadful as that thought must have been to them yet i think it was more dreadful to me and i was resolved that when the time came when the first violence was offered to one or the other i would choose that moment for my enforced act of suicide but it should not be a meek and sheepish finale man of peace that i was i was determined to go warlikely out of the world with blood upon my hands i tell you said carmen for to kill that man long time ago you not do it an now i say i tol you so  we were fools i said and now what become of us woman i ask now look here said bessie her face haggard and white with grief but the luster and shining quality of her eyes undimmed one thing at a time were not threatened at the moment and wont be as long as this wind holds for gods sake lets have no post-mortems or ante-mortems lets either get together and think a way out or lets pass these last hours cheerfully i think sometimes said carmen i run out and jump into the water i think of that too said bessie but so long as they dont hurt lichee im going to hold on to life as hard as i can-no matter what happens what difference does it make im low enough by all human rules and im ready to step lower-yes smiling-if only theres an off chance that theyll sicken of me and not hurt the boy and put us ashore somewhere theres no chance they do that said carmen not me they let us go-we tell on them pretty quick they not let that happen no said bessie its just a pipe-dream -but my little boy-he cant hurt them- he cant bear witness against them- he couldnt could he jim not legally i said but dont you worry about him bessie-were full grown and can stand anything and must i dare say but there must be a white spot in every man and i believe that carrols got a speck of a one honestly i think he wont hurt the boy the cabin floor was strongly pitched to port owing to the deep keeling of the shantung its angle was as a barometer of danger or safety let it but keep its pitch indefinitely and the women were indefinitely safe for our captors would need every man among them to sail the ship but let the wind fall and the cabin floor swing back to the level then i made sure other matters would at once occupy their minds but all that afternoon of waiting and thinking out desperate and futile stratagems the boards maintained their sharp slant only varying it with the pitch and roll of the vessel but toward sundown the general angle began sensibly to diminish and it was evident that the wind had begun to fall winds falling jim said bessie yes bessie i said well she controlled her voice with some difficulty dear old jim weve been good pals youve liked me in spite of the black marks and ive liked you god knows how much carmen rose walked to the cabin port and stood looking out upon the sea in a corner -that same occupied by chang in his coffin-lichee lay sleeping and curled into a ball jim said bessie weve all got to die  adventure some time-and the thing i mind most about whats going to happen to me is-oh well-that you should be alive to know about it bessie i said bessie dear-im a weakling god knows-but if thats all thats worrying you the first hand that is laid on you is the signal im waiting for i step out of the wrorld then bess-but not alone i hope having lived so long without my just share of strength and manliness it may be that at the last the lord will make me strong for a minute or two i have been thinking about it hard all day-how best to go at it and all that-and i think that if im very quick and very sudden maybe i can get my thumbs into carrols eyes and kill him before the rest can brush me off anyway that is how i shall try to-to enter my final protest-that is unless i can snatch a weapon from one of them jim said she would you rather i died fighting-or is it really nothing to you one way or the other  bessie i said and i took her hand in mine its so much to me that almost i think i would but if your boy is to be let off at last-why then my dear-then i think you mustnt die she bowed her head gravely then caught my hand to her lips and kissed it god help us all said she chapter xxix spirits of lavender with the falling of night there came a dead calm lichee still slept in his corner while bessie and carmen and i sat in silence-and waited it grew darker and darker but still our captors gave no sign at last however we heard steps upon the deck without and presently the cabin door was thrust sharply ajar and carrol carrying a lantern appeared in the opening  what said he  no lights tactful but cheerless well my hearties how goes it  he strode in and having thrust the lantern almost into our white faces and laughed he stood it with a clatter upon the table now then said he light up and set the table weve had a hard day of it and were going to have a bang-up dinner and pass the time with laughter and song hows the ship fixed for drinkables theres water said bessie and whisky and red wine-spanish red--  spanish red  exclaimed carrol smacking his lips where is it in the wine-locker said bessie under the lower berth in the port stateroom-in there and she nodded in the direction of the closed stateroom door heres the key she unslung it from her neck and held it out to him you know where the stuff is said carrol i appoint you cup-bearer put out a dozen bottles bessie flung the key on the floor now my dearest dear said carrol dont be a fool carmen leaned over suddenly and picked up the key i get him she said thats right said carrol heartily theres a sensible girl she knows wthich side her breads buttered and he turned on his heel and strolled out bessie turned coldly to carmen after all your hot talk about what youd do to carrol-youre a pretty weak sister i must say but carmen smiled-almost laughed and she bent down and whispered so that both bessie and i could hear there is one chance she said only laugh-an be gay an set that table a chance i exclaimed  better i not say a thing said carmen but look-i smile-almos i am happy i ask you if you hopes for paradise you set that-a table-an leave my little plan all to me bessie said i this is a straw but whats good enough for one drowning person ought to be good enough for another lets set the table  that is fine said carmen  that is fine  and she unlocked the stateroom door and went in shutting it after her presently we heard her striking a match half an hour later the table was set the cabin lamps shone brightly upon the white cloth and there came swigot and the doctor the latter looking much the worse for wear bearing smoking dishes from the galley carrol came in next and last of all brandreth and kelsey the latter had wet and slicked down his sparse hairs for the occasion and brandreth had gone so far as to shave his beard yellow men and gold  carrol seated himself at the head of the table forcing bessie to sit at his right hand lichee his eyes heavy with sleep came next to his mother then kelsey brandreth myself the doctor and swigot the place at carrols left was for carmen but she did not at once take it i am waiter she said i pass them dishes and pass that wine one by one we served ourselves from a tureen of bean soup that carmen laughing noisily handed the rounds of the table then stepping to a kind of sideboard that had been rigged she took from it a bottle of wine wrapped in a napkin and went once more the round of the table filling the mens glasses good girl said carrol and now my happy family-heres luck he tossed off his glass of wine at one gulp and held it out to carmen to be refilled warmed by the generous liquor he laughed aloud and catching carmen playfully round the waist drew her on to his knee she giggled resisted but went to him willingly enough as it seemed that wine smells funny to me said the little doctor were you speaking to me i said coldly i didnt taste it nor i said he its gone bad swigot rose suddenly from his place i feel kind er giddy he said its the smell of the lamps he went out into the fresh air funny said kelsey i feel sort of giddy-ive got a gripe in me stummick from her perch on carrols knee carmen smiled toward the speaker maybe she said you take one two drop spirit of lavender you feel better you not remember you have little bottle label spirit of lavender  kelsey rose to his feet with a sharp cry of terror and anguish whats the matter cried carrol sharply the matter cried kelsey my god -my god the woman has poisoned us and we are all dead men is that true cried carrol in an awful voice he rose unsteadily casting carmen violently from him true she said it is as true as roy cunningham look down from heaven know -you have drunk an you an you an now your dam soul go howling into hell carrol caught up the empty bottle of wine by the neck and swinging it over his shoulder hurled it with frightful velocity into the womans face she dropped with a sound of shattered glass and- go first he shouted and the next second i had felled him with the chair upon which i had been sitting and snatching a blunt knife from the table forced it somehow through his right eye into his brain then i rose still howling like a wild beast with fury and indignation but there was no need of any further effort kelsey and brandreth were in convulsions on the floor swigot had not come back and was undoubtedly suffering his last throes like a poisoned rat in some corner of the ship the doctor alone who had not touched the wine sat stiffly in his place he wras blue with fear bessie holding lichee by the hand had backed against the wall carmen had not moved gradually the horrid sounds that came from my throat ceased and i ran to bessie sobbing aloud as a child runs to its nurse buck up jim she said buck up were not out of the woods yet never mind-there you look out for lichee and ill clean the slate she darted around the table and caught the little doctor by the shoulders and dragged him from his chair now my little bomb she cried youve burst once on this ship and done quite some damage but youll never burst again overboard you go and she began to force him toward the cabin door they disappeared struggling violently the strong deep-chested woman and the weak spindle-shanked man one wild cry rang in my ears a moment later bessie breathing hard stood once more beside me jim she said its all over now and unless you and lichee and i play each other false-wthy alls well the moneys ours now-and there ought to be bright days coming to us all lichee you monkey you be fine rich melican man some day and jim-jim- here bessie broke dowrn and sobbed and i catching her in my arms had at that moment no memory of any other woman the end gy olaxton clarke hen the blue racer pride of the grand pacific by whose coinings and goings dwellers on the plains set their clocks roared into the freight division yards at shallow creek the hand of the fireman was on the lever and the engineer a limp huddle of blue jeans and grime lay on the floor of the cab five minutes later strong hands had borne the body into the agents little parlor and the white-faced fireman was telling his story to a sympathetic circle there he sat said the fireman with his head outen the winder same as usual an as natral as life an i never suspicioned anything was wrong till he hit the seven degree on the big trestle at the forks without checkin her a notch or shovin a spoonful of air on the shoes when i grabbed him he jest went all together like a busted balloon heart failure i guess hed been talkin of layin off a while with a pain in his side this two weeks he was a good man was denis hag-arty said one of the bystanders he was said stevens the division superintendent as good a man as ever poured oil into a cup but deniss virtues aint going to get the blue racer into wylie on schedule whove you got can take her through he added sharply turning to the master mechanic eben burt dick toft burt replied shortly only man id trust her to pulled in half an hour ago and up at the roundhouse now turning in his engine what-old faithful said stevens  i reckon youre right hell kick at going out again kick he wouldnt kick if i told him to shove his head into the fire   the wipers were busy on his engine when dick toft thick-set black-bearded and mahogany-visaged left the roundhouse and butted into burt who gave him curt orders to take number  on to wylie to a younger or more ambitious man the opportunity of pulling a lever on the fastest flyer on the continent would have been compensation enough for foregoing bed and board but dick was growing old and ambition had sickened on that dreadful night when the detectives came hunting for his son now a fugitive and an outcast and had died outright when a year later he laid his daughter the pride of his heart beside the wife who was now little more than a memory a lonely self-centered man was dick looking the world square in the eye without malice or envy but without friendliness and living out his life in boardinghouse and engine-cab without a grumble and without a hope but careless as he was of his own ad- kvj the ends of justice  vancement one compensating virtue like granite bedrock underlay the barren levels of his life-a dog-like loyalty to his masters and a rigid unswerving adherence to what he held to be his duty eben burt had not exaggerated dick toft had thrust his head into the fire before at the word of his superiors in the great strike when every wheel on the system was tied hard and fast by half a dozen words on a slip of yellow paper he alone stood by the company ran his engine through a yelling mob without the quiver of an eyelash went down with her in the ruins of dry run trestle and was carried back to be pieced together by the company surgeon uncomplaining and looking for no reward two years later when the fires were licking up the grass-lands between south bend and the magpie in hundred-acre mouthfuls number  special east two hundred thousand dollars worth between pilot and tail-lamps with dick toft in the cab halted abreast of a small slough with two walls of flame arching the track ahead and another half a mile wide galloping like a race-horse to cut off her retreat the train crew broke for water but dick a spanner in his fist and words of wrath upon his lips held his fireman to his shovel and brought his train through with the paint curling on the cars and the rails fairly buckling under the drivers he wrent into hospital looking like a singed cat and came out a week later to turn down the hand of his recreant conductor who had thought more of saving his own skin than the property of the company old faithful he was called from one end of the division to the other and the men while they respected him for his devotion regarded it tolerantly as a mild form of mania so dick trudged back by the side  of his superior and swung himself up the side of the huge shining machine which throbbed with impatience at the delay like a thing animate be careful dick said stevens as he hung on the engine step but not too- careful you know the old man grunted and the flyer swept through the packed freight-yards and out into the gathering dusk on the plains with twenty minutes to wipe off and a forty-mile tangent ahead of him old faithful opened her out and let her hum even to his seasoned experience there was a sense of exhilaration in the swift movement and the smooth following of that string of dark-blue cars an agreeable variation from the rattle and bump of the freights he had been hauling over the same track so many years it was late fall and the sting of coming winter was in the wind that whipped the cab windows dick thrust out his head and let it beat upon his forehead it was full twenty hours since he last kicked the sheet off and he was tired-dog-tired but the company wanted him and there was no protest even in his mind presently the stars popped out clear and unwinking and the moon lifted herself full-faced above a ridge of scrub poplar making the twin lines of steel shine like silver ribbons at the long curve which sweeps the base of dead squaw hill dick checked her up a notch and looked at his watch five minutes of the deficit wiped off he held out the dial to the fireman good business roared the other well do it all right all right and he bent again over his shovel but alas for mans calculations as the blue racer leaped out upon the long tangent a red light zigzagged frantically across the track a hundred yards ahead and with something very like an oath dick shut her off and threw the air hard whats up he asked sharply as the man with the lantern came running up he did not notice two figures which rose up from the right of way and closed in on his train the man sprang swiftly up the steps into the gangway and a pair of forty-fives covered engineer and fireman  hands up  he said with a coarse laugh thats what under certain circumstances the interior of a forty-five revolver looks as big as the inside of a tomato-can and the bravest realizes that he had best obey orders so two pairs of hands were promptly raised aloft the fireman was white with fear but on the face of old faithful was a black scowl of wrath the intruder was short of stature and strongly built the upper part of his face was hidden by a mask and the lower covered by a coarse black beard and mustache from the angle of the right nostril to the  adventure lobe of the ear a puckered white scar cut the cheek horizontally as he faced the engineer he uttered a slight exclamation and his arm dropped half way to his side but with an oath he steadied the muzzle back on the breast of the blue jumper no monkey business with me he said roughly the eyes of old faithful were glued on the unsightly scar a brave sight this for the eyes of the man that begot you james toft he said when black murphy split your face with the ax in dalys i would to god he had struck six inches higher the other laughed uneasily i wasnt reckoning on meeting you an thats the naked truth  he said i havent been keepin tab on the compnys circulars this while back an didnt know my daddyd got promotion wheres denis  denis hagarty died in this cab two hours ago the old man said sternly well dont you be a-fool an do the same thing the son replied meaningly for full five minutes father and son looked into each others eyes while the fireman stared helplessly from one to the other then from back of the tender came the sound of a pistol-shot and a cry of agony you murderous dogs said the engineer fiercely  what was that  reckon somebodys got hurt the other responded you keep still the brutal laugh which accompanied the words the insolent note of command pricked the old mans courage like a spur the half-veiled face with its sneering lip and unsightly brand of evil painted clear against the night by the light streaming from the half-opened door of the furnace filled him with a loathing unspeakable with a swift indrawing of breath and a gritting of teeth he ducked down and sideways and leaped in on his son a bullet starred the plating between the gauges but before the graceless villain could draw trigger again a knotted fist went fairly home among the black bristles on his chin and james toft dropped in a heap striking his head against the tender and knocking out what little sense his fathers blow had left in him the bell-rope-quick dick snarled and snatching the spare hank from the fireman he bent over the prostrate form in another minute the arms and legs of the unconscious train-robber were held in a close-embracing hempen spiral with swift untrembling fingers the engineer stripped off his jumper and plucking the mask from the white face at his feet bound it about his own eyes the broad-brimmed hat and heavy guns lay in the gangway where his son had fallen and he picked them up his eyes shone strangely through the holes in the black crape and the fireman trembled  what are you going to do  he asked in a voice scarcely audible above the drumming of the imprisoned steam my duty replied old faithful bide you here he said no more but dropped down the side of his engine and crunched his way back along the ballast as he came abreast of the tender two masked men leaped from the express-car and came toward him looking past them he could see the conductor standing by the forward sleeper hands above his head a thread of smoke hung in the door of the express-car little more than an arms-length away one of the men addressed him why in-dont you obey orders jim he demanded sharply what are you here for  this said dick curtly he laid the muzzles of his guns against the breasts before him and pulled the triggers both men went down one man limp and silent the other with a horrid writhe and yell true to his upbringing he tried a shot as he fell and ripped a furrow in dicks beard but before he could fire again the engineers cowhide boot took him square on the jaw and when he touched ground he was practically a dead man from the interior of the express-car came the shattering sound of an explosion half a dozen boards cracked and broke outwards and a whirl of pungent smoke bellied out into the frosty air dick tore the mask from his face and yelled at the conductor come here you blamed fool he cried are you going to stand there all night   bewildered the other advanced his hands were still in the air but he dropped them as he recognized the engineer you he gasped looking helplessly from the sturdy menacing figure to the sprawling forms on the ballast the ends of justice  pull your wits together bill haney dick cried impatiently are there any others back there  haney shook his head just them two he said they went through the cars first and put the fear of god on my passengers then they brought me forward and you-how did they pull you up is the track blocked with a hand to his cap he leaned outwards and peered ahead red light the engineer responded curtly but the man that showed it will never swing lantern again is he dead haney asked not yet was the grim reply he lies on the floor of my cab with a good rope about his arms and legs it will be around his neck before long-god help me a spasm of agony mastered in a moment distorted the old mans features do ye know him the conductor inquired staring hard the answer was long in coming the steel-gray eyes under the penthouse brows stared steadily down the string of lighted coaches he is my own son the engineer said at last holy heaven haney cried recoiling before a tragedy so much grimmer than he had dreamed of and-and what are you going to do my duty answered old faithful sternly he goes into the hands of the sheriff at south bend words of sympathy protest advice rose to haneys lips but died against the granite wall of the others resolution and he followed him meekly as he clambered into the express-car and made a hasty examination the explosion had severely wrenched the safe but the door still held fast at the farther end of the car the body of the messenger lay stretched there was a bullet-hole in the center of his forehead and it needed no expert in gunshot-wounds to tell that he must have died almost on his feet when the two dropped out on the ballast again the heads of excited passengers were poking out of the coach windows and several scared train-hands were making their way forward get the bodies into the car haney and herd your passengers dick said shortly i wait for no one weve lost time enough already he turned his back on the scene of his  exploit and tramped back to his engine and the company of his doomed son the blue racer sped onward wffjf through the night back in the cars the passengers discussed a testimonial and an address forward the engineer sat on his leathern seat and stared grimly ahead mile after mile the giant wheels devoured but his eyes never wandered from track and gauge to the log-like figure beneath him the fireman feverishly shoveling coal glanced furtively at it now and again but the father not at all presently consciousness returned james toft shivered sighed and opened his eyes there was a roar like thunder in his ears a hot blast beat upon him from the open door of the furnace and a yard away a coal-grimed sweaty face shone in the white radiance had he awakened in hell he uttered a faint cry and strove to move his cramped limbs but the coils were wound and the knots tied by a cunning hand and he was powerless then memory came and he knew what had happened and where he lay he had played his cards badly and the game had gone against him but he might yet save his own stake father he cried there was no response and he repeated the cry twice with a sort of whining insistence the fireman timidly touched the old mans elbow hes speakin to you he said dye think i didnt hear him the engineer answered in a hard voice he is no son of mine tell him that i will have no truck with him tell him that at south bend he goes into the hands of the sheriff to deal with as the law says bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh he may be- more shame for me-but i do my duty duty sneered the son maybe if youd thought less of what you call your duty id a been different dick answered no word and the other twisted his head round to the fireman here you he gasped you seem a decent kind feel in my vest pocket and take out what you find there the fireman glanced at his superior and reading neither protest nor consent on the graven mask complied and took out a small oblong case of cheap frayed leather open it said the bound man and the  adventure fireman again obeyed inside was the tintype of a girl barely in her teens a round-faced lass with curly hair hanging on her shoulders give it to him james toft cried fiercely hold it up before his eyes if he wont take it let him look at the picture of his dead girl that ive carried about with me good days and bad days for ten years and wouldnt part with it for all the gold in the safe back yonder she cared about me if no one else ever did let her speak for me the fireman held out the portrait and the engineer took it mechanically from his hand as he gazed on the features of his dead child a mist gathered before his eyes and on the face of the mist moved the shadows of the past a heavy tear cut the grime on the lined face and the fireman a sympathetic man with children of his own saw and swept a blue sleeve across his eyes dick snapped the case shut and handed it back to his subordinate put it where you found it he said let him have something good about him for the time he has to live  dye mean to say youre goin to give me up  the son cried brokenly the father made no reply and the other searching his face with the half-pitiful half-defiant look of a trapped animal saw no softening of the grim lines no relenting in the steady steely eyes only the knuckles of the hand upon the lever were white with the strength of its grip -you the son cried fiercely - you for an unnatural father may every curse-  the fireman laid a heavy hand upon his mouth and he groaned and fell silent dully staring at the squat image of fate perched above him and counting the rhythmical hammering of the great drivers on the rail-joints as they swept him onward to the scaffold three miles from the horseshoe dick thrust into his pocket pulled out knife and tobacco and carefully shredded a pipeful while the fireman watched him wondering he filled the old briar which lay on the sill of the cab window laid the plug and the knife still open on the seat behind him and looked at his watch thirty-five minutes to make up he said and well have to lose a couple more in the cut in the horseshoe  the fireman queried he looked at the shining blade on the seat then back at the engineer and the eyes of the two men met in a long steady stare in the horseshoe dick repeated raising his voice there was half a ton of rock on the track last week and i cant take no chances with a trainload of passengers ill have to slow her down he turned away his face and the fireman bent to his shovel again the cut aint moren half a mile away he said with great distinctness dick nodded shut off steam and with his hand on the air-lever thrust head and shoulders out of the window the fireman leaned across the prostrate figure and picked up the knife when he replaced it two newly severed ends of plaited rope lay on the floor lively now he said you wont get another chanct this is the horseshoe the air hissed like a serpent and the flyer trembled throughout her length as the shoes closed on the wheels james toft shook himself free from the coils slipped past the fireman swung around the edge of the cab and was gone with a well-simulated yell of surprise the fireman beat his fist on dicks leg hes away he cried hes escaped escaped  repeated the engineer avoiding the others eyes got clean off continued the fireman speaking with great rapidity of utterance he must have worked them ropes loose and lay there watching his chanct it come when you slowed an he took it slipped past me like a ghost afore i could ketch him thank god said dick in his beard he looked at the rope on the floor and his gaze dwelt on the severed ends with a sudden impulse he held out his hand and the fireman gripped it hard reckon he may do better for this lesson the latter said with a half sob then he too looked at the tell-tale rope guess this aint much good to nobody now he said and kicked it out into the darkness he bullet went out through the open window at my elbow and doubtless it startled the fish at the top of the water in the moonlight out there in the bay of panama the smoke floated up from the muzzle of the mannleicher till it struck the ceiling of jimmie hopes lounging-den and then it umbrellaed out till it mingled with dense blue vapor ascending from the cigars and cigarettes of the twenty adventurers filibusters beachcombers and other human rag-tags and bob-tails gathered in the place not a man stirred no one said anything bob cespinoza playing chess with gold-tooth naegel advanced the queen after glancing up yet they say the tropics get your nerves the man who held the mannleicher that had let out the splurging roar was a bit unsteady on his legs and was very white as he looked around expecting some one to fall but he was an englishman arrived that day he handed the piece he had accidentally discharged to jimmie hope who had been showing him his collection bits from various revolutions he had had a hand in and jimmie instead of hanging it up once more looked at it with a grim smile and passed his cognac bottle to the englishman saying to me half-dolefully half-quizzically if that had killed you captain it would have been the biggest joke in panama oh it would would it said i hows that jimmie asked one of the boys jimmie hope leaned back against the table drew up one knee and broke the piece then held it up to the light see what it is smooth as the cheek of a yucateco baby an old-fashioned belgian nigger-killer mighty nearly open at both ends that old smooth-bore has been through one war a coup detat with some shooting and several other occasions when it might have been used and yet never dreaming it was loaded i hung it up there with the very load in it that i put in it twelve years ago-see the copper shell and that nick on the welt-when i first handed it to one of the smooth-bore her-manos haw-haw-he-he i seen them guys laughed mctighe say was that you that had em jimmie id like to hear the straight of it well they are so tangled up with the history of a president or two still kicking that you fellows wont mind if i skip a name now and then i landed in new york by way of antwerp one day with forty-two cases of mausers and all that goes with them down in the pelvic regions of the same ship that brought me they were invoiced as angles meaning small structural steel parts and they were sure enough structural when we got through with them- the best republic-builders i ever saw i got them through customs and over to brooklyn to storage alongside the erie basin where a schooner by the name of the fortuna lay freshly scraped and dressed as if for a wedding general mena-mena- the fellow that ran carteret through for  nr  adventure writing tekel-upharsin after his name on the register of the hotel du monde in paris-had given me the  gold in havana to do the work with and he was to have the schooner and men ready i did not know who was the candidate and would not know till willemstadt it was a january night and cold and wet the men came aboard in fives and sixes up to the number of ninety nearly all recruits off the park benches and about midnight we were ready to ease out into the stream i had given orders to let go when i heard voices up the dock and running feet everybody was below all lights were out and i jumped to the plank a machete in my hand stop abie stop please dont make it i heard some one say out of breath from the sounds there was one man chasing another down the dock  i mil make it vy not answered the first man then the second man caught him and tried to hold him  let me go joey i have got to make it a soocide   please not to do it abie but abie jumped and pulled joey with him instead of hitting the water they landed about eight feet down on the tarpaulins lines and bitts of the port quarter of the fortuna and kicking and fighting rolled over and over on the deck the mate did the proper thing he threw a tarpaulin over them to smother the noise and dropped them down the hatch it sounded too much like a piece of shanghai to suit a quiet home-loving filibuster like me a fuss like that would have brought a watchman or a policeman in no time i did not have any time to investigate just then and it was only when we were safe beyond scotland light about daylight that i went below to see who our two recruits were i dont often get a good laugh but i did that morning still half rolled in the tarpaulin they were fast in each others arms asleep like the babes in the wood nature had been too strong for all their fears but to avoid being stolen away from each other they had tied their suspenders together in impossible knots  here you wake up i yelled at them tickling their noses with a frayed ropes-end they were two little red-headed smooth faced much freckled russian jews just such as you can find in regiments in rutgers park both were dressed in their best of light checked suits and a flower much mussed and withered was in ones lapel  what are your names wake up answer me the one in the green suit was hit with the trembles and tried to crawl under the tarpaulin but i yanked him back by his heels the other rolled his eyes scared to death but he could talk  oh gentleman oh mister pirate please not to hurt joey  joey who  joseph berkintowitz my brutter  whats your name  abraham berkintowitz please and i am his brutter  oh each is the others brother how nice say what did you mean by jumping on this boat last night just as we were sailing  oh and please make it not to be mad mister pirate him and me was to my vedding and ven i comes by getting her vedding dowry six hundred dollars is it her fadder he makes me a note by tree fifty and my brutter was so sad for me he makes it a soocide but ve fell across ven ve make a fall down at the vatter and ve fall over on you mister pirate  im not a pirate i am a soldier this ship is loaded with men going to war and now that you are here you must go along  ve go to varl ve dont vant to look at it  you are not to look at it you are going to help with the chores on battle days  battle battle abie and me got to be varriors and get shooted ill make it a resignation if abie dont  but you cant resign we didnt ask you to jump on this ship we didnt know you didnt want to go along and be heroes and fight bleed and die for liberty glory and bags full of gold  how much gold does a warrior get if he bleeds but dont die  he asked  that gave me a glimmer of an idea to have some fun and of all the ideas i ever had there was never one that i ought not the smooth-bore hermanos  to have forgotten and buried in the dead past quick however the only man who can do without experience is a prophet captain duncan the master of the fortum had been on a shindy with me about two years before when general torres y pesces had paid him three million and ninety dollars to escape to curacao the three million was in paper money of the torres government and the ninety dollars was in gold and silver duncan still had the three million dollars in his ships box and we had had a laugh over it the night before  lieutenant connel find captain duncan and say to him that general hope wants to see him i shouted up the hatch in a few minutes duncan stuck his head over and i told him in spanish what i wanted  now you berkintowitz fellows said i i am going to enlist you and give you your first months pay if you dont i make you walk the plank we cant feed you on a dangerous trip like this  please mister ve vont eat much  down came duncan marching with the ships box in his arms and an armed guard of four men i administered the oath of allegiance and then commanded the sergeant to open the treasury and pay them he opened the box and there lay the packets of green yellow and red ten-thousand five-thousand and one-thousand-dollar bills the berkintowitz who had been so silent and retiring till that moment came to life with a great joy on his freckled face with great gravity i took two one-thousand-dollar bills and gave one to each  your wages will be doubled for active service i said duncan nearly died from swallowing snickers mixed with tobacco-juice the guard marched away and the brothers began to come out of their trance they grabbed each other and did a regular yiddisher dance  hey hey cut that out cut that out i yelled at them they had gathered something of the conduct expected of them from the men of the guard and the way they tried to be a company of two front and salute was rich i got them berthed forward got those noisy suits off of them and put the sergeant to drilling them as soon as we struck the gulf stream then every day duncan and i used to lie back under the awning and wratch connel sitting in his hammock trying to teach them foot movements and the manual of arms laugh by gypsum it was the funniest performance i ever saw they could not have kept step if they had had only one leg apiece their idea of a gun wtas something to parade with like a flag on a stick though both was perfect on parade rest one day later on as we lay becalmed off greater abaco i thought i would have a little target practise the bosun rowed out in the dinghy about two hundred yards and set up a board and box target my experience has been that nearly every other tramp or roustabout on the docks or the streets of any american city is a drilled man ill go up against anything south of key west with any kind of a bunch i can pull together north of it our men all made a fair showing using the winchesters out of duncans cabin as i did not want to open the cases below i thought i would try joey and abie say do you know i pretty nearly had to break every rib they had even to get them to take hold of a gun with a load in it finally with duncan standing by with a belaying-pin behind him and with me holding a bayonet at his stomach we got joey to try a shot he leaned against the rail pretended to squint along the barrel and just about the time he had both eyes shut and the butt carelessly scrouged up in his neck he pulled trigger i got the gun as it wras going overboard and joey flew end over end and lit on the main hatch slowly he got up with one eye banged shut and his nose bleeding rummaging around in the front of his undershirt with his fingers he pulled out the thousand-dollar bill of torres money and held it out to me  take it mister take it der percentage is too strong for me well sir nothing would make them take hold of a gun again until connel happened to think of telling them that the kick was caused by the rifling in the barrel and that a smooth-bore would be just the thing he hauled out a couple of the several old mannleichers we had and showed them what he meant that satisfied them that was what i equipped them with that is how the smooth-bore brothers got their name linearly forgot to tell you about the  adventure sunburn the third day out it got hot and when i got peeled down to undershirt and thin cotton high-collared blouse i was myself again so were all the others of the bunch except abie and joey they did have sense enough to keep their hats on but the first morning they took their coats and collars off and by night their necks were raw with sunburn the next day they turned their shirt collars in for a kind of low necked effect so that the shirts would not rub the burns before night their chests and shoulders were sights to see and then abie fixed up an invention that nearly split that crew in two when he came on deck he found an old parasol tied it to a long stick fastened that along his back-bone and came on deck with no shirt on at all we got through the windward passage at night and five days later sighted point mike we stood along the coast to the east and about daybreak a fishing-boat came alongside with mena-menas nephew a little yellow hunchback with a major-generals commission signed by his uncle he told us we were to land far up in cristobal lagoon and if he knew the selection for presidential candidate he did not tell me following the fishing-boat we made the inlet at dawn and before sun-up were anchored in fresh water between two strips of islands thick with trees fresh though the water was it backed up or went out with the tide and by noon the fortuna was as nicely squatted in the mud as anything you ever saw-just like an old duck of war hatching out a hell-brood in the hot sun we had to keep quiet for we did not know who might come cruising around in there before night when we could get farther inland and hit hard ground just as the sun was coming up i walked forward to see how she rode and there stood the smooth-bore hermanos holding hands and watching the steaming water and the stinking jungle within half a stones throw  oh abie look by the parrot fowl cried joey  oh yes see the monkeys vat a gladness they make it answered abie gleefully  abie it is a country like central park only worse commented joey the monkeys looking for shell-fish left by the outgoing tide were frisking about the drooping limbs just over several rough logs in the mud and reeds suddenly three of them dropped in a bunch and instantly there were wild screams of terror from the whole monkey crew the logs had waked up into so many able-bodied and active alligators one big mouth got two of the monkeys and the third monkey was shared literally torn in half by the other two big gators loud as the monkeys screeched the brothers went them one better they tried to run to look to hide and to talk and yell murder all at once and ended up clasped in each others arms dancing up and down on the deck sobbing like two frightened children the mate grabbed them and shoved them below to stop their noise about two hours later the st kitts nigger steward brought me a letter jennerill hoap complamennty preezentatings dear ser-this indenture witniset that me  a berkintowitz cancils the contract asaid and returns payment made you diden told us you half them here r we wooden half come j berkintowitz we doan know the dade thanking you in advance when i got through laughing i wrote them a nice little note refusing to cancel the contract returned the two thouand-dollar bills and put in two for ten thousand each as a bonus we were floating at eight that evening and by dawn the next morning we were made fast along a jut of rock some miles inland and began to get the angles ashore the brothers worked like good fellows till one of them venturing twenty feet from the gang got in front of a red black and yellow land-crab and it scuttled for cover going over one of his feet he let out one yell and a string of yiddish prayers and dived for the ship his brother after him it cost me another twenty thousand of torres paper money to get them back on the job when the work was all done the rest of my command showed up-one hundred and sixteen whites and blacks commanded by three generals and divided into infantry cavalry and artillery the same being the ten thousand men mena-mena had promised me the nearest town was ayoilo ten miles away and we decided to attack it the next day i looked over the bunch dismounted all the cavalry and all but one of the generals and cradled the extra stands the smooth-bore hermanos  on their horses backs before i said good-by to duncan i said to him say captain we have been pretty good friends and i want to offer you a little token of my esteem heres a set of poker-chips a friend of mine in new york gave me and could you let me have about a million of that keepsake torres money i may want to choke these two yiddishers before i get through duncan was tickled to death with the exchange and i sure would never have let go of that poker-set if i could have packed it i was a little afraid of some of the boys joshing the brothers and putting them wise so i took them out and said to them  now boys to-day you begin to fight  vy dont you try to make it a peace first suggested abie  no we begin the war now here are your two guns see ive put loads in them dont shoot at anything or anybody until your commanding officer tells you to and then shoot to kill  oh abie he speaks to us to make a murder oh i cant do it i cant make it said joey beginning to weep now looky here said i getting hot under the collar  i am getting tired of you two ill do the murder if you dont brace up we are going to attack a cityito-day and if we capture it and you do your share of the fighting i will give you fifty thousand dollars each for a minute they were paralyzed then abie began to grin at joey and joey at abie and they picked up their old smooth-bores and marched back to camp in single file abie remarking  ve got to be brave to-day joey and make it a heroicness if ve never do it again emi about noon we topped a little hill ktjgj and there lay the little white-walled red-tile-roofed village of ayoilo i had picked up forty men and four horses from four plantations and had learned that there were two companies of government troops on station there i deployed my men when in range and was just about to send a messenger into town to demand surrender when the rifles began to pop around an old canning factory on the side of town nearest to us and a few bullets whistled through the green overhead the smooth-bore brothers immediately fell down and began to try to dig dog holes in the ground so i leaned over and let them have a few nips of my quirt the yells they let out were soul-splitting our boys were opening up in fine style and i was about to leave the two little scamps to shift for themselves when suddenly it occurred to me to remark that if either one of them got killed i would give the other one hundred thousand dollars life insurance joey was up on his feet at once kicking abie in the ribs and yelling come on abie come on ve got the percentage on our side come on you little coward look at the nerve on me i looked back a few minutes later and they were coming ahead but though a mile from the enemy they were charging bayonets jabbing sticking and reviling imaginary dying federals there was no reserve to the canning factory and as soon as we got the range and the steel-jacketed pills began to ricochet from the stone walls a white flag went up in a jiffy and we rode into town at high noon i was sitting in the doorway of the best fonda waiting for the reports on captured munitions and other things when i saw coming across the little plaza a pathetic sight-two thorn-torn besmoked members of my army-abie and joey they marched up proudly and i noticed that abie had one leg bandaged above the knee with real blood showing through and that there was blood on his bayonet and on joeys hands they came to attention and saluted finely and i looked on them with a more than pleased smile well what can i do for you boys you seem to have been in the fight all right oh dont say it gentleman responded abie with a proud glance that belied his modest words  ve thought maybe you had forgot to make something on us    well i guess i did forget i said with a laugh as i reached for my roll of torres official treasury stationery  here you are -fifty thousand each they were just about to march away to some place where they could express their joy when i called them back say abie better have the doctor fix that up for you over in the hospital maybe there isa bullet in there   oh no no it was not by bullets joey sticked me in accidents  adventure it is no use for me to try to tell you the fun i had out of chose two little chaps in the next month after they had got a line on the percentage of mortality they didnt mind a fight we took twelve towns without the loss of a man and they began to like war they picked up spanish faster than i ever saw men pick up a language and as the army got bigger and our requisitioned supplies increased i put them to looking after the accounting and administration of the commissary i have often wished since that i had just one commissary clerk as good as either of them i kept them wtell supplied with silver so that they would not have to flash any of those phony notes i only had about a hundred thousand left when we captured our second provincial capital and i was thinking about taking them into my confidence and trying to get them to exchange nine hundred thousand or so they held for a couple of twenty-dollar gold pieces when suddenly one night after we had captured boca del tocas they went into a gambling-house and got pitched out of a second-story window for trying to cash one of the notes in a game it seemed funny that neither one came around to see me and i concluded that they had put the blame on some peculiar peevishness of the gamekeeper which they being strangers in a strange land did not understand i ought to have known better i suppose anyhow i was getting a little bit too busy to bother much about them with five thousand men to handle and old ladriz trembling in carrido in his palace as we drew steadily nearer at boca del tocas we heard the news that instead of general ramirez our candidate being on the way from the west with another body of men ladriz had arrested him the second day after we had landed and when he had him in jail had fixed up a compromise with him ladriz was to keep the presidency for two years carvalho the vice-president was to be kicked out and exiled and ramirez was to be made vice-president with the ways greased to have him succeed to the presidential chair they had forgotten mena-mena and me and our republic-builders to date we were doing so nicely that i told mena-mena we might just as well go on and clean out the lot and make mena-mena president himself the only thing we needed was a force to capture puerto del nogales the one good port just as near to us now as the capital if we had control of the customhouse and could also land arms there to equip our recruits it would be all over but the shouting half the republic was ours every day he held the army in the capital ladriz weakened his hold on the people he must attack us and we could afford to wait it was the end of march before they tried it they had even taken poor old general torres out of his chair in his peaceful patio and put the good old warrior on a horse to command the army moving on us from the north ramirez the dog took command of the other wing a thousand men could hold my entrenched camp on the hill in the south side of town and i decided to take the others and go to meet torres i expected not only to turn him back but to take over most of his men then i could go after ramirez- chase him straight into the capital and maybe capture him before he could get there then it would be all over the night we moved out of town i was riding up to the head of the column when i saw two men in each others arms it was the brothers one had been ordered with us without my knowledge and they were saying farewell the next day i saw it was abie who was with me to uphold the honor of rivington street well its a good barrel that dont have one rotten apple we got in touch with torres the second evening the cunning old fox had me flanked before daylight and opened up as the sun showed with gatlings handled by englishmen who had come on for some fun from puerto del nogales by noon it was a rear-guard action and i had lost four hundred men early in the day i had swung my reserve around on a hill to meet his flanking and i got a sight of abie he was right in the front of the fight pushing on to glory it actually took my breath for a minute- iwas never more astonished in all my life and i couldnt help feeling a little bad when we struck the cristobal river and i got my men across safe and prepared to hold the ford during the night to find that among the four hundred back there was a berkintowitz and that somewhere up in little old new york a bride who had been the smooth-bore hermanos  robbed of her husband on their wedding night was now a widow when i rode into town all in good order it seemed to me that there was a terrible change in the place it took me about two minutes to find out that mena-mena had decided to go out to meet ladriz fearing i would get too much glory out of whipping torres he had made half a days march as if he were parading riding at the head of the army with a band some of ladriz scouting cavalry had swooped down and carried off mena-mena his staff and the band the army had returned mena-mena was not much missed but it was soon plain that in boca del tocas i could run a revolution much better without a candidate than i could without a band connel and i sat down in the cafe de angeles that night and it took a quart for me before i could laugh it was funny though from a military point of view i had the best army the best record the best position but i couldnt and wouldnt be president nor would i make overtures to an old traitor like ramirez no general with me was big enough there was nothing to do but hold fast and whip all comers right where i was until something happened the something happened quick enough the next day it was reported that torres was marching on puerto del nogales in four days he had captured the port taken possession of the custom-house sent an envoy to the united states representing his provisional government and was marching on the capital leaving a famous european soldier whose name nobody seemed to get in charge of the port and the custom-house torres was after the presidency what a fix that left me in you can see without smoked glasses i could not march on the capital and take it without a candidate no matter how strong i was i could not back up torres without being asked and connel and i used up all the whisky in boca trying to figure out who was going to pay us and our men for our visit to the republic none of us were that fond of travel and out-door life that we cared to sit around till a new president was installed and then be deported as dangerous to the public welfare the native part of my army melted into thin air the first two nights after the news reached us i was standing in front of the cafe de angeles one night waiting for the hill to come around so i could climb it and go to bed when i saw somebody i knew tramping down the street with a mannleicher on his shoulder it was joey i had clean forgot to tell him about abie then i remembered it was queer that he had not been around to ask i called him over  say joey you know your brother abie  yes gentleman  well i forgot to tell you he got killed in that fight the other night  and please that is too bad aint it you would have thought we were talking about my brother instead of his you could have put all the sorrow he showed into a chorus-girls sigh i looked at him dumbfounded for a minute then he began to fiddle and shuffle around a little bit and finally he said you dont make it to say anything about the insurance money genral  oh is that what you are thinking about well here you are joey and i pulled out the last hundred thousand of those phony bills and passed them over he thanked me and saluted fairly well then went on i had cleared the wires behind me as i advanced and the next morning i got a shock over them my operator called me and said the port wanted to talk to me at the wire he explained that the cable was working from the port east to esperanza and esperanza was wiring west to me  when the deuce did that start i asked  why somebody has been sending cipher messages to the port for several days they were on your blanks i thought it was you  great hellcats no but lets see what this is and what do you think greetings from general torres and an invitation to me to fight for the liberation of the republic from the tyrants that oppressed it and an offer of the post of third in command of his army we talked back and forth for a while he told me he was going to move on the capital in the morning-that his second in command was a very able soldier statesman and financier and he was going to leave him in command of the port i was to leave connel in command at boca del  adventure tocas travel to the port take over the customs money pay the army get up the artillery and put the three gunboats there in commission so as to hold the entire coast while he made a clean sweep inland he wanted his second in command relieved as soon as possible as that generals strategic and diplomatic services would be needed in the siege of the capital old torres was still raving about this man when the wires went bad and the talk ended boys i will never forget the morning i arrived in puerto del nogales i had a guard of twenty men including joey who had begged to be taken along from the hill above the town i could see twenty or thirty vessels in the harbor they had been held out by the blockage but now had got in discharged and were loading the freight yards were piled with incoming merchandise the custom-house was doing more business than a county fair outside the town i was met by a big mounted escort whose officer was all deference and who said he had orders to conduct me direct to the general in command as the garrison was drawn up in the plaza to receive me i asked ham the name of the general he tried to tell me but it evidently pained him as we rode into the square the guns began to boom and the band to play and there in the center was the general with his staff and he was certainly the most brilliant bird of plumage i ever saw he was about as big as a minute but he sat on the back of a giant white draught-horse his pants were blue and red he wore a brass german helmet his dress coat was solid gold as i approached after the salute and we came face to face may i never see a bottle again if my superior officer wasnt little abie berkintowitz now boys we all know too much about dignity south of the rio grande for any one to suppose that i let on though i almost fell out of my saddle behind me some one was weeping with pure joy that was joey i thought it was because abie was not dead i still had something to learn it was two hours before i got him alone in a room of the casa municipal and then i turned on him you little rascal said i how the devil did you pull this off what license have you got to be a general he almost got down on his knees to explain to me that he had not been cap- tured at all-that he had started to run away when the fight began only he had taken the wrong direction and run straight into torres army he thought he might as well pretend to be somebody as nobody since everybody around was pretending anyhow so he pretended he was a great russian general and torres believed him without thinking he tried to send a telegram to joey and when it went through and torres found the wires were open he made him a colonel in charge of communications when he put them on a business footing according to new york ideas torres was so pleased that he gave him the second place in the army made him minister of finance in his provisional government and put him in charge of the custom-house  and please you should ought to see vat a business i make it he concluded i found he had been in communication with joey all the time and the cipher had been roman letters for yiddish words it had been his idea to have me join with torres why so he could rejoin with joey well he made joey a general before sunset and the next day the news came that torres had had a bloodless victory and was president he wanted his prize strategist and statesman to come at once general berkintowitz arranged to have the custom accounts turned over to me in two days by a strange coincidence the mail steamer was sailing at that hour for france and joey was to go back to new york via europe he said a pathetic good-by to both me and abie and his last act was to hand me his old smooth-bore as a keepsake after we had gone a little way up the dock abie cried out that he must run back and kiss joey once again he would join me in the casa municipal in a few minutes i strolled on up the street and into the square i saw two porters lugging a box into the casa municipal and when i entered the commandants office there sat the box on the table i sat down to wait the cathedral bells struck noon an hour passed no sign of the minister of finance the second in command of the army the receiver of customs at puerto del nogales the french steamer was now hull-down on the horizon a sudden terrible thought grabbed me i ran to that box and threw it open first was a packet-the customs sheets i looked at the control sheet a samaritan of the riverine  credit of over eleven hundred thousand dollars gold underneath was a letter from major-general a berkintowitz first he resigned then he explained that when he found the torres money wras no good he and joey could not sleep of nights till they laid a plan to make it good he deserted to torres to give the old man the idea to be president and how to do it joey had staid only to get the last hundred thousand the promised insurance the only reason he had induced torres to have me come to take charge of the customs was that i having paid over the phony money would surely be the last to charge him with dishonesty if he changed the torres paper money for torres gold customs receipts gentlemen under that letter was the pile of notes i had bought from duncan for a poker-set and the balance was figured to a penny at the prevailing rate of exchange the rest had gone to france in joeys boxes of course i had to take one of the gunboats and get myself over to curasao before torres called for the money to pay the army i thought id heard the last of those fellows until this old smooth-bore went off to-night there hangs the other one   jimmie took down the old piece broke it and out flew a nicked ball-cartridge and neither one ever fired a shot a samarit the rive randolph bedford n the wild burning sheep-walk of central-eastern australia watered by the mighty darling and sundry smaller and deceitful streams where the winter is a flood where the summer is a furnace and the sun and the baked dust and the parched gums are of a uniform dull red and where the early spring is as delicate as its sister seasons are fierce the samaritan of the riverine lived in the body and there he lives in the memory even unto this day but the people of the rivers did not generally know him as the samaritan nor do they his real name was stephen been the wags styled him the has been  adventure he was over seventy years of age erect as a gum-bole strong almost as a man thirty years his junior and withal gentle as a child for his feet were very near the grave and already there were whisperingly chanted in his ears the forewords of the wonderful song that all men shall one day dying hear and that the new-born have not yet forgotten the world had dealt with him more cruelly than it does with its beasts for he was merely a man and a dull one which is an animal of no fixed commercial value this simple soul had been intended to pass through the furnace of the world unsullied here was a childs heart in a mans body and everything had seemed to combine to degrade the mind of the man to the level of the beast when stephen been was arrested in a suburb of london long ago when the last century was young he might have been described on the charge-list thus a clod eighteen years old at any rate the law recognized that he was a clod and immediately set about breaking him in twain as a preliminary to fertilizing the barren soil of his mind the poor shivering frightened animal had stolen half a sheep value five shillings and the law sentenced him to seven years penal servitude to square the accounts debit one-half sheep five shillings received payment with thanks seven years transportation if the law had made out the account in a businesslike manner that is the way it would have read so the clod with a number of other clods and a fair sprinkling of genuine criminals was embarked for botany bay to serve his sentence botany bay was not the clods destination by the way port jackson was the particular hell he was bound for but the knowledge of australian geography held by english state officials at that time was limited if that voyage did not make of the clod a fiend it was not his fault the genuine criminals just referred to were bad enough the marines and the crew were worse an earlier voyage of this very ship had lasted nearly two years for the trans- port had taken out a cargo of female convicts on that occasion and now it had been entrusted with the conveyance of mostly first offenders whose chief crimes had been poverty and hunger and whom the state alleged it intended to reform and the states methods of reformation were the lash the chain the tube-gag the collar the scaffold in a word its instrument was the executioner its example was blood that orgie was forty years old and strengthened by its experiences when stephen been landed at sydney cove being stupid he was very quiet and his jailers mistaking his stupidity for stubbornness brought him up for punishment on the paltriest of excuses they would flog the mule out of him said they and instead they flogged a devil in so he became an animal and as he passed from the lower vegetable state he had been born in to the higher life of the carnivora he was made what the system called a dangerous felon he attempted to escape seven years were added to his first sentence-his floggings were more frequent then hobart town and maria island the aggravated hells of convictdom followed just before his additional sentence had expired a member of the clods gang-a hybrid creature half convict half convicts jailer proposed that the gang should escape in a body the gang acted on his suggestion and attempted to break jail mr hybrid sold them to the commandant of the station and all of them were captured more floggings more jail for the animal-clod the law limited the term of imprisonment then passed on him but it did not specify the number of lashes he was to receive the commandant could attend to that trivial question and to do him the justice due to a zealous government official the commandant did the informer was at that time about twenty-four years of age he had yet to serve five years of his sentence for forgery but the crown granted him a free pardon as the reward of his treachery and he left tasmania for the mainland stephen been returned to his cell in hobart jail and received the first of his new series of floggings he did not feel the strokes he was repeating to himself-as if he could forget it-the oath he had sworn to kill the informer he did not flinch from the flogger for he thought of his revenge and revenge is the kindest liniment a samaritan of the riverine for wrong so at last the most meritorious convict system had made the inoffensive clod first an animal now a devil in  he was discharged from hobart jail after serving twenty-four years in a hell that could have been made only by man twenty-four years of a life that might have been made a source of good to the living thrown away in expiation of an alleged crime that had long been dead the name of the hybrid informer was abel shaw he went to australia as stated and when gold was discovered at bendigo he went to the field and was allowed to mine for he held a free pardon his claim wras one of the lucky holes-the informers fortune was assured from the hour in  stephen been also reached bendigo and stepped into a new world his intention was to raise himself into a respectability he had never known in the days of his innocence and to do this only money was necessary for the one-time clod saw now that respectability is merely accumulated money in its most portable form he had never borne the appearance of a typical criminal and as the police inspection was lax owing to the smallness of the force he was allowed to secure a claim unquestioned in three days he had bottomed with what trembling eagerness he washed his first pan of dirt the result of his labor with the pick and the shovel and the cradle and the dish meant more than gold to him good- they meant peace bad-they were the prophets of a return to the old life but the results were good the clod-animal poured the water from the dish very carefully and saw seven water-worn pebbles which he took up on the point of his clasp-knife and felt anxiously with his tongue then he began to tremble and to flush hot and cold and at last the tears came he had found gold more he had found hope for over a fortnight he won at the rate of upwards of three ounces a day fortune as if to atone for his twenty-four years in perdition courted him and gave him gold the ring of the pick was gold the sweat of his brow which had been agony at maria island was wealth at old bendigo and then the determination to kill the informer came back to him and blotted out all his visions of happiness he had been planning what he would do with the money of course he would go back to his own little village in devonshire provided of course that he could escape the vigilance of the police and when he reached england he would play the banker to his family and all of his old friends his people should never toil again happiness should be theirs for the rest of their days and all the old daddies who had mumbled their kind-hearted commonplaces over him as a boy-worn old figures whose joints had been curved and gnarled by the bitterness of their unproductive labor clods who had wrought to make the master rich-the master whose clay they were-should have their pipes alight and their glasses filled for ever and ever so the poor heart that wanted to buy love at any price or to steal it if need be builded his castles and day-dreamed between the pick-strokes all the people he intended to benefit were long since dead and freed at last from the dread of starvation which had accompanied them as a shadow through all their cheerless songless lives but stephen did not consider that death might have spoiled his plans he had suffered so much and yet had lived and he thought it must be terribly difficult to die and so he planned lovingly for the few people who had given him a kind word or look in the days of his cloddishness-planned to requite them as their misery deserved-not with the measure of man but with the measure of love brimful and running over but a product of the old half-forgotten hell shaw the informer to wit stepped in and blasted all these unselfish intentions stephen been met hia enemy in a busy street or rather track of the camp some months after he began to win a fortune the samaritan-to-be forgot all his dreams of benevolence to the dwellers in the little english village he had left so long ago within the space of a thought he sprang at the informer closed with him and bore him to the ground and there deliberately began to strangle him a trooper probably for the first time in the history of the world was at hand and he promptly struck stephen been with the blunt edge of his sword and towed him to the large hut with many intermissions in the slabs thereof which served as a jail final result-the informer was regarded as a martyr who had done his duty to society and had been undeservedly pun-  adventure ished therefor and been was once again sentenced-to two years imprisonment a few months after his sentence had expired he fell in with his enemy again this time at woods point a little more gold-winning another assault another sentence this time for five years and when that sentence had expired he found himself with only a few pounds as capital-his gold had been deposited with a man who was shortly after detected robbing a sluice-box and all the metal in the possession of the thief was handed to the robbed company as being their property said stephen been as he left beechworth jail in  and shook his impotent hand at its heavy blue-stone walls ill kill the dog next time-ill kill you if i live long enough ii but he did not stay long in the country of gold the metal meant men and the presence of men meant police and the law even to find his enemy and wreak a just vengeance on him was not inducement to brave these terrors he saw that only in comparative solitude could he find peace wherefore he shouldered his swag and stepped bravely north-an indescribably pathetic old man of fifty-five the system had done one good turn for him truly the torture of its rigorous discipline had brought the sorrow that whitens the hair and furrows the face it had made his heart old before his heart had known youth but it had also developed in him wonderful physical endurance-it had deadened his body to pain made it indifferent to hunger converted him into a perpetually adaptable creature to all however rapidly changing conditions of existence and as he trudged along the rough track his heart began to beat with youth as it had never beaten before he had never felt love except that dull half-awakening to human sympathy in old bendigo in  and now the million scents and voices of the eternally beautiful bush told him that such pure attractions as it could offer were the especial property of such as he ting-a-ling said the bell-bird and the swag was heavy no more tweet-tweet said the minah and the jail and the informer were forgotten north farther north through the giant granite ranges through the valleys of the murray and into the plains of the west he traveled flying from man always going deeper into the heart of the great wild whose message of peace had been breathed to him three hundred miles nearer the sea at the stations in his track he never asked for the usual ration of flour and mutton he demanded it and paid for it and then tramped to his lonely camp a mile removed from even the horse-paddock this sullen reserve lasted long after the murrumbidgee had become a daily sight to him and the speed of the current heralding its junction with the mighty murray showed longer and stronger in the eddies at the bends there venturing near to a homestead unusually early in the day a horseman rode up to him and inquired if he wanted work yes sir said stephen been humbly pulling at his hat as if he were still a number and not a man i want a man to load wool and to take charge of a barge to echuca of course stephen been accepted and a new era began for him he fulfilled his contract satisfactorily and made many trips on the river which he began to love as he loved children and all things that were young and were not men he could not read and yet he was the best freight clerk the rivers ever had two tons of wire for burrabogie said the carrier at echuca and a case of whisky for mungadal and so on and stephen been could have told you all his freight before he was out of port a day he used to run over the names of the stations on the river just for the pleasure of feeling his importance as a freight clerk you might find him a dozen times a day chanting the euphony of the station nomenclature thus  groongal pevensey mungadal eli elwah burrabogie illillawta albemarle terry-walka ulonga to infinity and then it was a new life his importance as steersman of the barge the quiet green leaf-tinted water the sobbing of the engine of the towing steamer as it breasted the current-all had the charm of novelty and the appreciation of newness which is surely gods best gift to the adventurous man with a soul by-and-by he became a property-holder the boss liked the strong old man who a samaritan of the riverine  could work without a word who never used the usual language of the river and the shearing-shed-the boss could curse fluently by the way and the super was exceedingly profane and blastiferous and who could be trusted alone with a barge-load in a  strange port because he never drank so one day being present at the sale of a river navigating companys fleet the boss having previously sounded his bargeman on the subject purchased the tilpa a side-wheel steamer ordinarily used for trading purposes and her attendant giant the bunyip barge then he arranged instalment terms with the ex-convict and been entered on his new line of ship owning on the strength of being a shipowner he secured long credit with several firms for the supply of miscellaneous stores and started from echuca one summer night with steamer and barge laden almost hulldown with everything that the inhabitants of the west might require-sheep shears and moleskins fencing-wire and onions boots saddles and tobacco-a floating store it was a happy life from the beginning he managed to pay for the barge he opened a bank-account he was respected men called him captain been he had never to leave the beloved rivers most of his dealings with the stations lying on the three thousand miles of water were on the credit system and here his absolute dearth of education told much against him however his faultless memory and a unique method of bookkeeping invented by himself and consisting chiefly of sundry knife-cuts on the starboard paddle-box enabled him to collect at least seventy-five per cent of his money that and one hundred per cent profit considered left him very much on the right side of the ledger he would sell his stock at the head of the darling and then load with wool for echuca to return with stores on the next fresh the life drew from him all sourness he became the samaritan of the rivers the tilpa up or down trip continually carried men who wanted to work their passage and who evidently translated that phrase as meaning the consumption of as much tucker as the cook could prepare and be the end of their stage at brewarrina or bourke or tilpa or louth or wilcannia or menindie they left with half a pint of whisky in their stomachs and a shilling or two in their pockets and some tobacco and rations in their swags did not bathurst the educated loafer of the rivers get three pounds of captain been by telling a story of an asthmatic mother and did he not a year afterwards tell me that been was the samaritan of the riverine and wherefore is not this history written the loafers who sponged on him loved this simple old man who knew of nothing but the rivers and would talk of them for hours you know that bend near crismus island he would say theres two of the cunningest water-hens you ever see-i believe they know the tilpa now why theyve been there this five years an whenever we passes there they flies around to the sterns much as to say lets see if its the dear old tilpa or that puffing billy the saddler whats always firin rifles at us i believe they can read the name of my boat too and then he would repeat that only boast of his to the effect that he could take the tilpa what was drawing four-feet-seven over a four-foot-six bar and he could steer her from dunlop to albemarle blindfold- yes he could oh ye might stare and yer might say no but he could if it comes to that hed give you a passage an prove he could do it blindfold-there his friends loved him and he knew no enemy there was in his nature a stubborn good which even the great penal system had been unable to destroy from fort bourke to the campaspe he was known and he was honored and yet most men knew his history his moments of sadness were few he felt fiercely revengeful when he thought of the informer but the memory of his wrong was beginning to fade in his prosperity only when he saw children playing he realized what he had lost and their voices were as the touch of a hand on his old loveless heart if he could have stolen one of those curly-haired babies at culpaulin or dunlop i believe he would have done it but  brought him the love he craved for sjgf near easter island the tilpa stop-iifn ped in the early moonlight to  wood-up and the gentlemen of the river who worked their passages wrestled languidly with the ax on the rottenest and therefore the most easily cut and the worst fuel they could find in the center of a space embayed in the  adventure shore by the island a solitary travelers fire gleamed fitfully the traveler was extremely disgusted with his situation he had been intended by nature to be the most gregarious of men and circumstances had made him an ishmael on the track this was his second night away from home and the prospect of the road which had seemed to him free and independent and glamoured with the romance of the bush was now very very dreary therefore when he saw the tilpa moored to the bank and all hands from captain to cook cutting wood for the engine he walked over to the workers wishing to lend a hand and too proud to risk a snub so he stood by while they worked and would very probably not have spoken to them but for the fact that he saw a tall spare magnificent old man bowing under the weight of a dead branch ill take that daddy he said daddy stephen been staggered with amazement and the weight fell on the travelers shoulders when the work was finished the captain almost forced the young man to accompany him to the little saloon where they drank a tot of whisky each he questioned the young fellow in a kindly inquisitive manner which proved his interest and little by little he found that the travelers name was george garth that he had quarreled with his father whom he said he did not like and there was an end to the matter he had set out from louth two days before to walk until he met something to do and then the captain insisted on garths remaining aboard and he sent one of the gentlemen who were working their passage for the swag by the new chums fire then he installed his friend in the best berth on the wheel-deck and saw garth worn out with his unusual tramp fall asleep as the tilpa steamed down the moonlit river that word daddy from such a man had given stephen been the son of his loveless dreams and won the samaritan forever next day garth asked to be given something to do and the old man who had very hazy ideas on the subjest suggested that he ought to take stock and garth did so and placed the tilpas financial condition in such a light that the samaritan thought his knife- notch style of bookkeeping might not be absolutely perfect after all he broached the subject to the mate in the wheelhouse that evening seems to me jim said he that the young man mights well stay  an look after the bills -be a whats it supercargo said the mate shortly yes thats it assented stephen been wont do makin any more oles in the paddle-box thats a fact if you chop it much more therell be no starbd sponson at all bime-by youll have a ship made of holes and so george garth became supercargo and the trade with the young women at the stations increased amazingly and the old man found the young one more valuable than he had dreamed and loved him more dearly with the birth of each successive day the affection was mutual the old man was lovable and then they had so much in common both loved the river-that was everything and been showed the supercargo the wonderful water-hens in the bend near christmas island and told numberless stories of driving the steamer full speed ahead when the river was dangerously low because the banks were streets of fire and of shooting the punt rope at wilcannia when the stream was in flood-he sang in his rough vocabulary the epic of the river men and when they passed a tortoise paddling and spluttering in an insanity of fear of the smoking bulk of the steamer been would remark that the terrapin was very like an old jew lizard he had known at fort bourke in  and that there jew lizard-he was a terror for santypedes an such like an he once et half a pound o shin o beef at a siftin he did for his part garth was in paradise the preliminary work of setting affairs in order being ended he had nothing to do while the boat was between stopping places and so he roamed over the steamer at his will now in the wheelhouse now on a sponson then in the bows with the first streak of the day the steamers whistle ran along the river reaches and as she steamed away the nude figure of the supercargo appeared on a paddle-box-he dropped a bucket into the foaming wheel-wash drew it up and drenched himself with the contents and after that by the time he was dressed the steamer a samaritan of the riverine  woke the life of the river before the sun had touched it and the mallards started for the days flight for they were unreasoning creatures and flew on a straight line ahead of the steamer too foolish to think of getting out of the way and the ghostly cockatoos fled daily before the tilpa westward when the summer was waning for they intended to winter in the murray at eight oclock the bell sounded breakfast and garth joined the captain and his mate in the saloon which was about the size of a fairly large packing-case and after that smoke-ho and a revel in the careless knowledge that the next homestead would not be sighted till the afternoon it is a fine life this innocent exisence of the rivers it is a paradise for whoever has a soul and souls were owned by been the captain and his supercargo garth but discord came to the paradise one day in june of  when the river was lowest and the tilpa and her laden barge passed dunlop on the last upward trip for the season the super of the station hailed the steamer and came aboard he wanted only a few trifling things he said but he delayed the tilpa half an hour and in his desultory conversation with the captain told him that coruna the next station eastward had changed hands the new owner he remarked wtas mr garth a j p and no end of a swell the captain retailed the news to the supercargo later on and wtas amazed at the confusion of the young man you ought to know all about it i suppose dad said garth at last this mr garth is my father and weve never agreed -thats why i left him thats why i dont want to see him again till im independent these remarks of course resulted only in making been all the more curious and by judicious pumping he learned all the facts garth senior was very unscrupulous he had done shady things in stock deals and mining transactions garth junior objected and the old man had told him to clear out with his honesty and not come back again unless his honesty brought him enough to live on and therefore garth junior had cleared youre a white man commented been when the young fellow had concluded well let him see that honesty does pay-  i avent much longer to live and the crafts yours when i go no no talk now-ive said it and i wouldnt go back on my word for no man they stopped at coruna to canvass the new owner before some other trading river-tramp secured the business captain been now quite an experienced diplomat in his way sent a message by the mate requesting mr garth j p to honor the steamer with his presence and five minutes after a white-haired old gentleman stepped on the tilpas deck he wras mr garth he started violently as the supercargo came forward saying how are you father he did not start when the supercargo introduced him to captain been he merely said  glad to meet you captain i hope we shall be able to do business together but stephen been as he took his customers proffered hand felt sick with long-thwarted revenge for mr john garth j p and the informer of the old maria island were one man ill the shock to the samaritan had been very great there in the new life of fairness and clean hands and free goings out and untrammeled comings in the corpse of the convict-time had come to resurrection for several hours following the departure of the informer wrho had left the tilpa without any idea of her captains identity he sat in the little cabin next the wheelhouse with his arms folded and his head fallen on his breast the supercargo looked in once or twice to ask where the steamer was to tie up and wras told to steam easy till i tell you the dusk crept over the river and the great sponson and bow lamps were lighted and the cook rang the bell for supper but the captain still sat in the cabin on the wtheel-deck arid told his friendly querists that he was all right- never better-leave him alone he sat there and thought until he was almost mad at nine oclock the mate went to him and insisted on being heard the night was very dark the river wras dangerously low the stream was sown with snags hadnt they better tie up stephen been aroused himself by great effort rose and went into the wheelhouse there he went over the rough chart-which was rolled up in a great box and was almost  adventure as long as the river itself-and told them to tie up in the next bend his voice hollow as the voice of the dying made mate and supercargo look at him surprisedly they saw that the face was not the face of the samaritan always clean-shaven it had resumed the expression of the hunted convict at bay its lines had hardened the lips seemed to have become thin and sneering and cruel the eyes were shot with yellow gleams of revengeful madness the mouth was half open in a horribly hungry fashion the eye-teeth standing conspicuously in the bare and livid gums were like the fangs of the wild dog you are ill dad said the supercargo pityingly no im not answered been i lifted a big weight to-day an ive strained my back the mate suggested a sweating bath in a wet sheet but stephen been refused all the remedies of the river and without waiting to see the beloved tilpa snug for the night turned in in the darkness there came to him strange old shapes he hoped he had forgotten-the ghosts of the gang who attempted the escape for which abel shaw had sold them to the commandant there came the ghost of young hitchins-the boy who had in the frenzy of recapture killed the constable who had attempted his arrest the boy who had in the awful desperation of his gallows-death uttered blasphemies that made even the executioner shudder there came the shape of peter wells who died on the triangles during his punishment as ringleader of the escape there came to him others-sad shapes saying hesitatingly that the time for justice had arrived noisy blasphemous shapes calling on him in the name of his manhood and of his oath to avenge their stripes and the greatness of their old-time misery some were cold and half apathetic some despairing some hot with the white heat of long-nursed wrong but all of them commanded him to do the one deed-to slay their common enemy and as if they had been so many men and he were indeed their captain too he had told them that justice should be done and had waved them aside as if they interfered with his thoughts then the shapes left him to decide on the manner of garths death all sorts of schemes mostly impractica- ble suggested themselves to him he would decoy the informer into the dry wastes in the backblocks of the river kill his horse and leave him to die of thirst he would invite him aboard the steamer and leap into the river with him he would lock him in the cabin and shoot him these and a hundred other plans worked in his brain he rose early the next morning still undecided on the manner of garths death- still determined to exact full payment of the revenge owing him however for that week at least he could do nothing he must mature his scheme the tilpa resumed her journey up-stream with her captain in the same undecided frame of mind three days after they had reached brewarrina the river fell alarmingly and the tilpa was forced to remain tied up at the wharf until the next fresh during this period of enforced idleness the captain came to a conclusion as to the way the death sentence passed by the ghosts of the murdered on the informer should be carried out the accepted plan was grotesquely horrible -the jury of dead felons by their foreman stephen been had both found the verdict and imposed the expiation garth the owner of coruna was sentenced to be dressed in the old canary costume then to be tied up and flogged to death the labor of decoying and binding him was easy to the samaritans diplomacy and the samaritans strength and revenge would make his arm tireless of the scourge until the end a fine revenge truly the samaritan felt almost happy as he thought over it the fresh did not arrive until august and then it was small and carried them only a score of miles west of louth the mate and supercargo worried and fretted under the delay they cursed the river which was not much more than a chain of pools they stamped the deck because september was very close at hand ere this they should have been half way back from echuca ready to sell out the store to the shearers and to get the earliest bales of the clip and beat the hated saddler and the warrego on the down-stream journey stephen been smiled calmly at the delay there was plenty of time he said he did not care if the barge went down-stream empty-let the saddler have the wool--what did he care a few homestead lessees a samaritan of the riverine  -men with a paltry ten thousand sheep or so-had cut out early and the clip of these small men came to the tilpa and filled the barge fairly well and this fact served to cheer the supercargo and the mate they would not be able to trade very much because the store was almost empty but they could get wool-loading in early so that they would be ready to race to the market on the rise when it did come but they felt uneasy for all that simply because all the life of the stream seemed uneasy also the rats began to leave the river and scurry up the banks and on to the plains every day saw an exodus of rabbits and then there came that leaden hush of everything which precedes any unusual occurrence in nature the river did not seem to ripple as it struck the floats of the tilpas wheels and the ducks flew away from their natural home the screaming cockatoos screamed no more and flew south instead of west as usual the gum leaves murmured not the air was heavy with suppressed fear-even the birds of the month the parakeets which were merely animated shrieks in a dress of emerald and crimson flying athwart the gold of the sun were strangely mute the whole earth seemed to hold its breath so that it might not sigh the apprehension which filled it and stephen been noting these signs stretched a wire cable from the towing-frame of the tilpa to the great eucalypt growing in the billabong inside the southern bank and the engine rusted by its long rest drove the steamer to an opening in the tree-fringe just abeam of the anchoring gum they prepared in short with the impudent daring of man for a standing fight with an inundation they saw no man belonging to the land they were as much alone as if the river had been a trackless sea no news of the flood had come to them they blamed bourke for not having sent warnings but bourke itself was wrestling despairingly with the water giant the founders of the town have built it in the shorter parallel of a horseshoe bend just where the river can do its greatest most destructive work while the people of the tilpa grew sick with anxiety bourke was up to its arm-pits in water-bourke was disheveled and drunken with the flood it came to the tilpa in a wall of water and wreckage-a wall of water that broke and reformed and fell upon itself with the sound of thunder a wall that tore patriarchal trees from their roots and hurled them along like matches a wall that hissed like a great serpent and gathered and crushed the face of the world in its constricting folds it came with the battering-rams of trees of wreckage covered with snakes and other creeping things huddled together like friends their venom sapped by fear as the tilpa and her barge rose with the flood the crew hauled on the cable and started the engines and so by-and-by drew the steamer and her charge up to the tree which the mate said would stand forty floods but at three oclock the next morning when the rain was falling in sheets the mate recanted the fastening of the cable disappeared the water crept into the limbs of the tree and shook it till it groaned and still they held on in mid-current the water was black with timber and living trees rafts of debris carrying hopeless animals-opossums swooning with fear bears wailing like little children lost in the streets of a great city at four oclock they heard a steamers whistle shrieking above the roar of the water and a few minutes later a wool-laden barge shot past them then followed a steamer her red lights tinging the water as with blood her stack vomiting sparks the men on the tilpa could see that one wheel had been carried away by the battering of wreckage very probably the rudder had gone also and she was attempting to steer out of the current with the remaining wheel it was the warrego she had ridden from louth on the face of the flood the warrego disappeared then came more wreckage the flood drew back for an effort advanced again and passed triumphant carrying with it the tilpas barge and  worth of the seasons clip just after daylight the savior eucalypt was torn from the soil stephen been sprang to the towing-frame and cut the cable with two lightning strokes of the axe and the tilpa went full speed ahead steering south on to the plain which was now a sea any one of these logs that came down with the current like stones from a sling would sink the steamer in an instant and they tried to make for the dead water but it took time to leave the current its force was so great that the helm answered spas-  adventure modically and between the spasms the engine drove the steamer down the stream with a frightful velocity they wrere not caught by the dreaded wreckage-they caught it finally at eleven oclock they  reached the still water covering a treeless plain and there they anchored that plain although the samaritan knew it not covered corona station they breakfasted at noon and the captain was unusually jolly the loss of the barge did not matter much he thought with a curious smile on his face he wouldnt want it any more but he was sorry for the boys sake all the same during the afternoon the wreckage became larger it was not confined to tree and river debris now fence-rails boxes furniture and to show how far the water could penetrate a cradle came bobbing and turning into the haven of the steamer they found that the cradle by virtue of its shape was an ark of this deluge the rescued being mostly snakes and tarantulas and scorpions and centipedes and all the insect horrors and creeping things which no living man may imagine at four oclock a hut came down escaped from the current careered wildly in the eddies and then collapsed with a noise like the discharge of artillery against a tree which had so far been too strong for the flood then a minute later another hut swimming high out of the water ran down in midstream and then abeam of the tilpa suddenly shot athwart the current and collided with the same tree but it did not go to pieces a projection in the timber wedged it in the tree fork and there it stood exposing its bulk to the swirl of the deluge stephen been and the mate and garth looked at the arrested shanty expecting it to break up suddenly the captain exclaimed - if there aint a man on the thing  quite as suddenly he lowered the dingey one of the two only boats of the tilpa sprang into her and pulled for the wreck before anybody fairly understood his intention he had become a samaritan again he had forgotten his revenge at the sight of a man in danger he had left a haven for the jaws of death the man on the hut was still now he had been waving his arms to the tilpa until he saw the boat put off to his rescue the samaritan pulled to the wreckage as if his own existence depended on his speed his struggle to keep the broadside on to the boiling current was almost titanic but at last he reached the lee of the anchored hut and after fastening the dingey to a projecting spar swung himself into the tree the castaway greeted him with a cry of joy stephen been clambered on to the hut and straddled the ridge-pole so that he was face to face with the man who had suffered the perilous voyage on the quaking building and then the samaritan been became the convict again his face was transfigured -he looked at the wretch whose eyes were so close to his as a terrier might look at a rat his face expressed an awful joy-the happiness of the strong courageous devil who finds a coward devil in his grasp the informer noted that sudden change and in the space of a thought recognized his old enemy and shrieked aloud so ive got you said stephen been very slowly enjoying to the full shaws accession of fear i knew id get you sometime and then with the snarl of a wolf dye remember little hutchins an peter wells you dirty liar do yer dye remember bendigo and woods point an youre a swell now are you an a squatter an a j p an all-an yeve got a son whod drown yer if he knew what yare and ive been playin a lone and-all me life through you you dog through you the informer opened his mouth to shriek for mercy but the roar of the water drowned his voice and the grip of the captain on his wrist made him dumb im goin to leave ye here said been again an its an easier death than i meant for yer-its an easier death than theyd agree to-theyll ave ter content themselves-with it he spoke of them as if they were indeed men and not impotent shadows the informer made no answer-he was dumb with terror so good-by to yer   concluded the captain may ye go to the hell ye sent those boys ter an may ye meet em there he ceased and swung himself from the roof but ere his foot touched the tree the informer mad with fear caught his wrists in a grip of steel and screamed aloud above the artillery of the flood a samaritan of the riverine  the struggle was very brief stephen been wrestled with his enemy on the swaying hut for a moment and freeing himself reached the tree and looked down for a foothold in the boat but that struggle had given them both to death the swaying of the hut had loosed the spar and spar and boat had darted off with the current the convict gnashed his teeth in rage and climbed higher into the tree to signal for the other dingey to his surprise it was not more than a dozen lengths away-the mate and the supercargo had seen the struggle and had hastened with their assistance they steered the boat under the gum and called to stephen been to drop in itll hold only one more safely advised the supercargo stephen been prepared to take the jump and seeing him the informer shrieked again then the supercargo looked to the figure on the hut and recognized  the blood-eyed foam-flecked wild animal in the coverings of man-his father still he did not falter theres only room for one he repeated to the man whom he respected jump dad been hesitated-the expression of affection had half killed the wolf in him the informer began to cry and pray and blaspheme by turns his big round face working convulsively jump dad said the supercargo jump quick-we cant hold on here much longer stephen been had decided the wolf was altogether dead the samaritan breathed again ill wait till nex time he said take this snivellin vermin though he aint good enough to sit in the boat with you george even in that awful moment george garth wondered at the words and the expression of dying hatred but he had no time to think just then a crying shivering bundle fell through the air and into the boat and the dingey headed for the steamer the mate calling to the captain to hold on a little longer but before they could reach him the great gum tree went down and the hut with stephen been perched on its roof drifted with the boiling current they got away from their moorings and had the engines going in a marvelously short time but the hut was not then in sight the darkness did not end the search all through the night the tilpa was a blaze of red lights tramping up and down the water-road one moment staggering painfully up-hill against the swift stream the next shooting like an arrow from a bow with the current and the whistle shrieking at every pile of wreckage at dawn they spoke of him as dead yet they persevered in the search they intended to find his body if they tramped the river as long as philip vanderdecken cruised off table mountain and at ten oclock they found him and he was yet alive the house had collapsed against a heap of debris and the timber had pinned him by the waist during the night the pile had largely increased and the great wreight almost cut him in two yet he had survived the awful experience his feet had been frozen in the icy water his middle had been crushed by the weight of the floor-wreck and still the wonderful vitality the convict system had developed in him had strengthened him to triumph he did know them as they hailed his discovery with cries of pity and affection as they dug him clear of the debris as they tenderly lifted his bruised body and dangling useless limbs from wreck to raft and from raft to the steamer-ark he heard only the fearful chorus of the flood-the rushing of great waters and the clarion song of the new-born at its antiphon in the afternoon he awoke to find himself in his own berth with the supercargo bending anxiously over him oh dad dad said the young man youre all right aint you you dont feel any pain stephen been smiled  im not all right george but i aint feelin any pain my backs broke-thats what it is and then he dozed again as the lamps wtere lighted he asked if the river had gone down not enough to be safe out of the dead water the mate told him but they could get a boat ashore in the back-wash easily then stephen been cried fiercely let him go ashore then put the vermin ashore im the last of them all-dont let him see me dead and wondering they obeyed him the supercargo quite at a loss to account for the hatred of his father told garth senior that  adventure he must quit the steamer and a deck-hand rowed the pariah to the edge of the flood near to a point where the sight of a slush-lamp said very plainly i am the cheer of a man at nine the samaritan made his will in a style peculiarly his own he i u called into the cabin the cook the engineer the deck-hands and the gentlemen of leisure who had in the search for him probably for the first time in their lives become energetic and there verbally transferred the tilpa and her trade to the mate and the supercargo yeve all been called as witnesses that this day the twenty-seventh of september eighteen seventy-nine ive given the tilpa an two barges at echooky an the book debts an trade an all to jim drake an george garth so help me gawd and they all said they witnessed the bequest and the ceremony was over only drake and the supercargo were to watch the sick man that night and when the cabin was cleared of the others he lay on his pillow quite exhausted they suggested sending to louth for a doctor but he said a doctor could do him no good-he was cast right enough and so they fed his flickering strength with brandy despite his exhaustion he insisted on giving them full particulars of the trade in this way there was a man on burrabogie who owed twenty-six shillings in seventy-four-nex time youre on the bidgee collect it-i dont recklect his name but yere bound to find im-he was a little cove with a wart under his ear and a ginger beard when yere up that way too leave a bag o loolies with the super at benduck es got a lot of babies an  one of em useter cotton ter me quite reglar an alwus give a nip to the puntman at wilcannia and hell drop the rope for yer any time at night he fell into a half sleep towards midnight and the watchers turned the lamp-light low the change of light seemed to awaken him but although he spoke again he did not regard their presence up at crismus island theres the cunningest water-hens you ever see and when the old tilpa- and again- yer can drive this yer tilpa over a four-foot-six bar an she draws four- foot-seven and yet again--the saddler ill beat her to echooky blindfold at two oclock in the morning he awoke out of the present to the memories of his old life-the little devonshire village maria island norfolk the beautiful hell of the pacific of the boy hitchins of peter wells of old bendigo and then as he came to the association with the supercargo he made garths tears well anew that vermin cant be yer father said the samaritan and then he added for i love you george my bo  he lay there with his brain strangely active thinking and sorrowing for the life that had known nor wife nor child nor friend-for of even the love george garth held for him he was as uncertain as a girl with her first sweetheart-sorrowing for his wrongs a little but glad to know the long journey was to end at last he had known only the embraces of the gyves and the caresses of the floggers lash and the memories made him break into words anew ive had a hard life he said a hard life its been an only me an gawd knows it-only me an gawd after that he lay very still for the night and most of a day and when he awoke again the flood had retreated to the river and the tilpa was stranded on the plain like her captain she would never move again in that hour before the dawn when the wind laden with the death-fog springs from the river the samaritan spoke with a material tongue for the last time only me an gawd knows it-only me an gawd and as the first rose spire of the dawn leaped from the land-rim and tinged the stranded steamer and the haggard earth with light stephen been received his absolute pardon in the new joy of the world reprieved for yet another day the watchers seemed to hear the song of the new-born swelling triumphant dixie pasha thomas p byron he faith of an arab is endless i so they believed him for he had a pale luster in his eye that  might have been the fire of the desert moonlight on the nights that he had watched and prayed alone in the mountains and his voice had a deep tremulous sob that made the flesh of men quiver and their hearts to burn these were his words i bear the name of the prophet and i am a hadgi of the brotherhood of the der-kaoua for seven years have i lived alone in abstinence and prayer on the mountain called the ksar of the spirits where many among you have seen me there i have spoken with allah who is the one god and with mohammed who is his prophet i bring to the children of islam the message that they shall repent from their sins and smite the roumi and drive him from the land even as far as ain-sefra where they must tarry until allah the one god and mohammed his prophet make known their further will through me-mohammed jeb-bour such is the command of the most high and in his name i proclaim the holy war there is no god but god and mohammed is his prophet it was in the month of ramadan of the thirteen-hundred and twenty-sixth year of the hegira that mohammed jebbour preached the jehad in the oasis of bou- denib by the river guir in the heart of morocco the moors believed for it was written that a prophet should come out of the wilderness to lead islam to its own again and his words fanned to a blaze the fanaticism and lust for spoil that smoldered in their breasts so the word went through the desert on the wings of the sirocco and the oases sent their men to bou-denib-even from the farthest ksars of tafilet and all who heard believed for mohammed jebbour was an orator and they gave him gold and fast camels with silken palanquins and stallions whose manes and tails swept the ground and they raked the desert over for beauty for his harem-and  bel-hakk  the holy one was well paid for the seven years of fast that he had spent in the djebel-roh praying to allah for the sins and sons of islam the news came to the outlying oasis of oudaghir and the ouled abdul kerin stalwart desert-robbers who preyed on the caravans of all-even the roumi and the phantom touareg sent a hundred men on swift meharis to fight for the true faith and for spoil and these pushing haughtily through the faithful to the very feet of the hadgi heard and believed also among them was a very tall very black negro whose face was scarred by four deep   adventure scratches that ran the length of it just missing both eyes and as this one heard the passionate sob of mohammed jebbours voice and saw the moonlight in his eye his imagination blazed within him and set strange little pulses to beating in his throat and the roof of his mouth-just as would have happened had he listened to the words of a haytian voodoo-doctor or a west coast gree-gree man or an exhorter at a georgia camp-meeting then he went forth from the mosque and lay under the palms by the oued guir and dreamed and presently he gathered the men of oudaghir about him and spoke to them long and eloquently and when the dawn broke they were gone and their caravan was like a string of black ants on the flaming eastern horizon surely what was written was written and allah and mohammed had settled the thing once and for all and the scar-faced negro was as fanatical a believer as any but one can not forget ten years in the twenty-fifth u s infantry- even in the great sahara this was in the days when one french column was at casablanca and another marched on fey from northern oran and still another advanced on bou-denib from colomb-bechar where ends the railway that some day will reach to tomboctou ii an advance-guard had seized the wells at daybreak and given the ait-usilt warning and at ten both wells and the pools in the oued were sucked dry all the moisture of the poor little oasis had been but a drop in the bucket for such a host-six thousand men the horses of the cavalry and the countless camels of the caravan that bore their provender and munitions of war by noon the ait-usilt had swept the village clean of their belongings and their tiny caravan had commenced to creep away to where the oasis of their brothers the beni-garfa lay in a tremulous green blur against the sand-dunes that were flung across the horizon like a polished string of flashing topaz there they could find water and refuge until the plague had passed by and the wells had filled again a company of zouaves guarded the water and were encamped beside the dried riverbed a half-mile or so from the deserted ksar and from time to time they sent the camel water-corps with a load of moisture to the column that crept by a mile distant like a great party-colored snake whose brilliant maculations were blending to a uniform shade in the sudden dusk the bright uniforms of the chasseurs and the zouaves ceased to flash likewise the white turbans of the spahis and the coats of the horses and the machine-guns strapped on the camels and the small cannon and the auto-mitrailleuse that snorted through sand axle-deep and over rocky hammada even the hues of the tricolor blended and the snake became bronze-all bronze the hue of mens faces and the fine desert sand that floated about them like a veil of delicate texture the zouaves began to light their campfires for their orders were to hold the wells until morning when they would procure a last supply of water before deserting them an hour before they had thoroughly patrolled the ksar and found it vacant and its inhabitants were plain to be seen miles away-a poverty-stricken band of weeping women squalling children and unwarlike men there was little danger for the scouting cavalry had reported that there were no bodies of arabs in the sparsely-inhabited country that they were traversing but their guides did notknow that beyond the shoulder of the mountains that lay to the south a hundred men waited in the naked desert  regardez mon capita ine said a sous-officier of the zouaves to his superior look there is an arab who comes from the ksar the captain looked in lazy curiosity a tall black-faced man wrapped in a white liaik had walked slowly down to the edge of the river and looked curiously at the camp of the zouaves and at the column beyond which had stopped and was making its camp for the night a sentry stopped the man when he would have crossed the oued you can not pass here he said contemptuously the mans bulk and his scarred face were formidable but who would have dreamed of danger from a single arab when a column of six thousand troops lay only a mile away when the tents of a company of zouaves lay just beyond the oued the sentry did not dixie pasha  think that already the darkness was blotting out the ksar-which was tiny but a labyrinth-and that beyond that lay the great refuge the great hiding-place the desert the arab smiled and made as if to turn with a swift movement he seized the end of the musket and wriggling aside from the thrust tore it from the sentrys hands turned it about and drove it through his breast with a single motion the other sentinel shouted and would have fired but the arab was upon him with a bound the soldier threw up his weapon in defense and the bayonets locked the negro forced him backward jerked his weapon free and a sudden left-handed thrust sent the blade out six inches behind the zouaves back the assassin planted his foot on the dead mans breast and drew the bayonet forth seized the other gun and leaped away balls whistled about his ears twenty zouaves sprang in pursuit but a sharp command brought them back the officer was furious why didnt you kill him-the rest of you he demanded while they gazed in consternation on their slain comrades it had suddenly become entirely dark and he redoubled the guard shoot every thing that moves was his last command it wtas incredible-two sentries killed within fifty yards of the camp and the murderer had escaped well to-morrow there would be reprisal for a squadron of spahis or chasseurs dafrique would be sent to beni-garfa where the assassin had undoubtedly fled there was no moon but the night was clear with the soft luster of the stars the milky way shone like an incandescent ribbon of gauze stretched across the sky and the shooting-stars fell like rockets all about the horizon the long line of camp-fires of the column glowed like splashes of vermilion on the murk of the earth their light was reassuring yet the sentinels of the zouaves were uneasy it was the desert mysterious threatening and ravenous that seemed to draw up closer and shut them in with horrors that waited just beyond the circle of light it was after midnight when a sentry thought that he saw something move in the dry bed of the oued he watched it a moment and then raised his gun but a hand was slapped over his mouth his head was jerked backwards a razor-edged sec-quin was drawn softly across his throat and he fell back into a pair of arms that laid him carefully on the ground it is a very simple thing for a twain that have worked together before but some one bungled a bit somewhere for one zouave managed to let off his gun the hubbub of screams and occasional shots that came faintly to the ears of the column lasted but a few moments and ceased altogether just as a zouave weaponless and breathless burst in gasping of an attack the drums rolled the call to arms and the column quickly formed but the expected attack did not come although the first zouave was followed by a dozen corroborative others the spahis circling quickly about came to the camp by the river it was silent and the fires were extinguished the rest of the zouaves were there and a dozen or so of arabs to boot but not many the attack had been too sudden and overwhelming also there were a few rifles that had been overlooked but not many of these either it was a stunning blow a company of zouaves wiped out in five minutes within a mile of the main column the next day the punitive expedition went through beni-garfa with fire and sword of course the people there were not the assassins but they must have known and should have told and a lesson was never amiss among the children of the prophet it was a man of genius who planned that attack said the french general he has modern guns and plenty of ammunition we shall find him at bou-denib with mohammed jebbour in the meantime the men of oud-aghir were dreaming while the negro harangued them in his broken arabic he had been a marvel to them when he first came amongst them as a slave he had been a marvel since and now he was thrice a marvel that he had planned this wonderful coup and won for them the weapons of their dreams and sam ames once of the twenty-fifth u s infantry and more recently an outlaw in the republic of liberia looked on the eagle-eyed hook-nosed sons of the desert that gathered about him  adventure with their bayoneted rifles and his chest swelled with joy he had found the soldiers of his dreams so he drilled them and drilled them and drilled them relentlessly under a sun that would have turned to molten metal the spinal column of a white man never soldiers toiled like these in the long days that he kept them at a tiny oasis behind he djebel and filled them with his own fierce ambitions and presently they were letter-perfect ran to ranks like madmen at his shout went through the manual with dash and precision aligned the while straight as a string maneuvered marched in fours formed in a square fired in volleys went through the bayonet-drill and lunged with the terrible left-handed thrust with wrhich he had killed the zouave at the wells of ait-usilt there were eighty of them that had the new weapons and one morning when he had drilled them he paused flashed a proud glance upon their gleaming eyes and bayonets and shouted a single word bou-denib bou-denib they roared back hoarsely and the march began the others following with the camels they never took the bayonets from their guns did these soldiers sam ames loved cold steel so-and intended to use it on the day that the spahis of mohammed jebbour smote the roumi presently as he listened to the measured swish of their feet in the sand out of pure exultation sam ames began to sing it was a song that he had sung to them a thousand times before and not one among them but knew its meaningless words by heart for there was that within it that made them grip their weapons hard and filled their breast with tumult like the words of mohammed jebbour so presently one took up the words in his harsh guttural voice and then another and another until the whole of the eighty chanted it forth mangling the words and tune but getting the fire and the rhythm of the thing something caught in sam ames throat and a mist passed before his eyes there is no god but god and mohammed is his prophet he muttered under his breath and then he marched straighter and prouder than ever his soldiers were singing his song ill all the spahis of mohammed jebbour rode in fantasia on the narrow plain that lay between a hill which dominated all the country and the oued guir which separated it from the palmeraie and town of bou-denib the hadgi himself green-turbaned and white-robed mounted on a milk-white stallion and surrounded by the sheiks reviewed them as they rode about like men of quicksilver in seemingly inextricable confusion firing their long fusils throwing them high in the air and catching them again with their long white robes flying a dozen feet behind them grazing each other continually yet never colliding at the end of the plain they gathered and swept down in a cloud and stopped suddenly with a great shout pulling their horses back upon their haunches the heart of the hadgi swelled with belief in his own prophecies could the roumi stand against spahis such as these again they wheeled and rode away and circled about again but this time a body of them whirled past the flank of the hill look said a sheik to the hadgi a caravan is coming more spahis shrunk to lilliputian size and distinct though tremulous of outline in the palpitating heat a body of footmen were approaching behind them were others with camels there was the beating of drum and the chant of a song the fantasia swept out and around them yet still they came on the drums beating the song swelling louder the sun glittering on their weapons mohammed jebbour saw that it was a company of men marching regularly in the order of the roumi suddenly at a shout from their leader they swung out and advanced in a single line to within twenty feet of the hadgi and the sheiks their leader shouted another command the song ceased and they halted aligned straight as a string heads on high rigid of body a third time their chief roared a command and eighty muskets came forward as one in rattling salute to the hadgi and from eighty throats boomed out in unison the creed of islam there is no god but god and mohammed is his prophet dixie pasha  the wondering arabs pressed close on their heels but the soldiers of the line stood like rocks mohammed jebbour stretched forth both hands and there was silence he stared in wonder at the huge negro before him at his scarred face and jet-black skin who are you he demanded we are men of oudaghir come to fight the roumi your speech is not that of a moor whence come you i come from a country of unbelievers that lies across the great salt water i was a soldier there i came to the desert from the fever country of the black men that lies far beyond sus i was a soldier there too first i was a slave in oudaghir with four others i escaped we were chained together by the neck and a lion killed the four others one by one at the end i killed the lion then they took me back to oudaghir and made me free for they saw that i was protected of allah there be men of oudaghir here who knew me when i was a slave are you a true believer asked mohammed jebbour amazed there is no god but god and mohammed is his prophet when i became a true believer they gave me the name of mohammed xnd you wish to fight the roumi we wish to fight the roumi i and these men of oudaghir have taken these weapons from a company of the roumi that we slew at the wells of ait-usilt- a murmur went through the crowd they had heard of the exploit at ait-usilt these men of oudaghir obey me as their sheik went on the negro i have taught them to fight after the fashion of the nas-rani you shall see he shouted a command and the arabs gave them room as they began to maneuver they went through the manual of arms like automatons worked by a machine then they marched and wheeled and threw themselves into a square with fixed bayonets while mohammed jebbour and the sheiks rode slowly about the wall of bristling steel that met them everywhere then the negro from the center shouted hoarsely and they divided into two bodies rushed upon each other fiercely with a shout of dickshi dickshi and their bayonets locked and clashed the eyes of mohammed jebbour kindled and his tremulous voice was deep it is plain that ye are good spahis he said the men of oudaghir shall be my bodyguard they shall fight under my eye and they shall throw about me that wall of steel on the day that we smite the roumi and you-you shall be their sheik and a pasha peace be with you thus mohammed of oudaghir became pasha of the bodyguard of the hadgi mohammed jebbour who led the jehad and he was honored among the sheiks and holy men but the eighty that he led called him always dixie pasha-dickshi pasha to be exact for the song that he and they sang and they themselves were called by all the faithful the left-handed eighty of dickshi pasha and their leader drilled them and drilled them and drilled them while the other spahis rode in fantasia and sharpened their lances and simitars and loaded their long fusils with round stones and scraps of iron cunningly piecing out their scanty powder with fine black sand against the coming of the roumi but dixie pasha-no wonder his heart swelled within him and he dreamed dreams eighty spahis-eighty giants-who fought to obey his slightest command who sang his song who drilled like men of steel all day in the grilling sun and each one of them had a modern rifle with a bayonet on the end of it and a belt full of cartridges surely the name of dixie pasha was to be written in great letters on the sands of bou-denib it was kismet and presently the roumi came iv his guides had told him that the hill at the end of the little plain beyond the river dominated bou-denib and the surrounding country and it was there that the french general had determined to plant his six-pounders to bombard the town it was there also that mohammed jebbour in the midst of his sheiks and the eighty watched the approach of the column the whole battlefield was spread beneath them like a great panorama illustrated by tiny movable puppets the incredible clearness of the desert air rendered every detail and every movement patent although the actors were dwarfed to miniature as if they were beheld through the wrong end of a telescope  adventure on the town side the hill dropped abruptly to the narrow plain beyond lay the river like a sheet of quicksilver and then bou-denib half-hidden behind the motionless fronds of the palmeraie its blue-washed walls and house-tops crowded with women and children even a couple of priests could be seen on the minaret of the mosque but not a sound came to the hill in the other direction the french column advanced in the form of a rectangle the caravans had been left behind the infantry formed the lines within were the cavalry and artillery a crowd of arabs hung on either flank and kept up a continual harassing each puff of smoke when a gun was fired rose like a tiny white cloud all day the french had been kept so continually on the alert that their nerves were worn to a raw edge no one knew how many men mohammed jebbour had and the desert as far as they could see was swarming with them and lives were cheap in the desert- mohammedan lives were doubly cheap at times the arabs took advantage of a rise of ground to make a frantic charge and were swept back by the volleys of the infantry soon the pops of the firing began to come to the hadgis ear as they drew nearer the french could see him too plainly as he stood high on the crest of the hill in his green turban and snow-white haik he was within range and dixie pasha who knew it wondered why they did not open fire for the sun was sinking and in a few moments it would be dark and too late he knew that the attack was to take place when it grew dark enough to get to close quarters without being swept down by the volleys but the french were old hands at this sort of business they too were waiting for the darkness to come-to administer a crushing blow that is the hadgi on the hill yonder thee general had said just before the arabs start to charge shell it and sweep in with mitrailleuse when the enemy break and retreat let the cavalry follow them around both sides of the hill and let the infantry support them the hill is very difficult of descent on the other side the guides say and if he waits there a few moments longer we will get him but dixie pasha had a keen eye and he knew the warfare of the roumi when they trained the machine-guns and six-pounders on the hill he threw his men around the hadgi and the sheiks and hustled them over the summit at the same moment the cry of allah il allah  thundered from the plain below and the thousands of arabs swept forward in a universal charge but they were not met by volleys this time the infantry opened up and the machine-guns began to rattle when the arabs were only a hundred yards away they swept the floor of the desert clear in a moment and then the infantry poured a volley into the arabs that completed the work and the spahis and chasseurs dafrique rode out and cut down the few that had got to close quarters but the bulk of the arabs had broken and fled under the -withering hail of the machine-guns shells were bursting on the hill-top too but the men of dixie pasha with the hadgi in their midst were picking their way with difficulty down its precipitous farther side a company or two of the foreign legion took the lull on one side of it the spahis swept at a trot followed closely by the zouaves and legionaries on the other side the chasseurs dafrique pursued the algerian tirailleurs at their heels it grew totally dark with the suddenness of the desert the stars came out and a thread of moon swung over the minaret of the mosque dimly outlined against the sky the arabs had seen the hadgi himself flee in the last gleams of light and never drew rein until they had splashed through the oued and were gathered on the farther shore and dixie pasha with his eighty men thrown about the hadgi and his sheiks reached the foot of the hill just as the two wings of french troops came curving around its flanks they met out beyond him in the center of the plain between him and bou-denib he was caught between them like a grain of corn between two millstones but first the millstones were to grind each other a bit the spahis galloped up in the darkness the sound of their hoofs was like far-muttering thunder but only their white turbans were visible at a distance of fifty yards the chasseurs and tirailleurs were waiting and the last poured a volley into them and then the chasseurs were out to meet the charge with drawn swords they in their turn were riddled by the blast of a volley from the zouaves and legionaries and it was only when the cavalry gasped under the dixie pasha  steel that they realized the horrible mistake and recognized each other for friends on both sides the infantry had pressed forward at their heels and the whole plain was lighted with the flashes of continual fusillades the same cry echoed from everywhere at once we are friends you are firing on us- the spahis-upon us the chasseurs-upon us the legionaries stop firing stop firing s the firing ceased and they drew back and stared at each other officers and men screaming questions and answers all at once where is the enemy they demanded the marabout-has he reached the town  quick commands that rang out from the foot of the hill were their answer and a volley swept a lane through them as a bowl clears an alley of ten-pins again the cry of stop firing arose and the soldiers sprang in a disorderly mass toward those who they thought had made this new blunder another volley met them a hoarse chant arose and the next instant a body of men were upon them singing as they charged with fixed bayonets again the french fell back screaming that they were friends they could not believe otherwise arabs firing in volleys and fighting with bayonets it was incredible an american negro of the foreign legion sprang before the advancing square who yoh-all he cried who yoh-all dat sing dixie   a bayonet through his breast was his answer and the french understanding at last leaped upon them with screams of rage these were the men who had slain the zouaves at the wells of ait-usilt their leader was a renegade who had planned the attack and who had taught them to fire in volley and to fight with bayonets  the arabs met them with a wall of bristling steel and the march of the eighty across the plain was begun they had only three hundred yards to go to gain the river but it must be cut through the mass of humanity before them with the bayonet they were in the square formation that dixie pasha had taught them the hadgi and the sheiks were in the middle and the same single idea dominated each breast the hadgi must be carried in safety to bou-denib that he might lead the faithful to victory on the morrow the french infantry leaped on them and died on the left-handed bayonet thrusts the cavalry rode at them over friend and foe and horses and riders went down slashed to ribbons the barrier of steel was always there and it ripped its way through them as a circle-saw rips through a log and the eighty stamped their dead foes under foot and climbed over them steadily toward the river cutting their way through flesh and blood bone and sinew leaving a trail of crushed humanity in their wake they all knew that it would be but a moment before the host beyond the river would understand and come charging to their rescue and yet-could they last that moment two soldiers stood in the place of every one that wras cut down the arabs ceased to sing and panted as they fought holding their formation with utmost difficulty for the enemy never relaxed his deadly compression but cursed and tore at them and dragged them forth with their naked hands while the bayonets and sabers clashed against each other in their bodies yet always the square was a square and always the hadgi was in the center of it and always it moved onward as they shrieked their cries of allah il allah and dickshi dickshi while they drove their bayonets home with their terrible left-handed thrusts but the square and the eighty shrank and shrank and shrank-like a snowball under a july sun  dixie pashas head was gaping under a saber-cut his breast and legs were slashed yet he felt a wild thrill of joy as his men under his hoarse commands kept their formation and protected the hadgi and he fought with superhuman strength heedless of his wounds they were hemmed in by a world of enemies that was crushing them in ever-tightening constrictions and then- from the oued came a fierce yell of allah il allah as the arabs charged to their rescue in a body the french met them with a straggling fire the more recently arrived infantry which had still maintained its formation riddled them with volleys and drove them back but the first furious charge had carried them to the heart of the tumult where the remnant of the eighty still guarded the hadgi and when the arabs o adventure fell back across the oued they carried the square with them mohammed jebbour was there and unharmed at least a dozen of the eighty were there and dixie pasha was there as they splashed into the water he fell and was caught up by two of his men one of them sobbed deep in his throat they carried him across the river on their arms he heard the gurgling of the water and the irregular firing of the french who had ceased to pursue on the edge of the oued above the minaret of the mosque he could see the moon pared down to a fragment of its glorious self as was he-as were his spahis no they were still there for they were singing his song as they carried him- the song that had made him a soldier when he was known as the blackest nigger in new orleans it sounded something like this am sufern landt ah tek mah standt andt luff am dhoi am dickshi yes they were there and to-morrow when he was rested they would smite the roumi for the hadgi was saved and they would get more guns-and cannon-and he-sam ames-would drill them all-all the thousands of mohammed jebbour and their army would sweep- but he was very tired and must rest now so dixie pasha closed his eyes when the square was sucked back in the backwater of the charge the french had fired until they judged the enemy were safe beyond the walls of the town then orders rang out sharply and they ran about seeking their commands and the jumble became an orderly body of troops again suddenly they all fell silent for across the water they could hear the arabs singing an air that dwindled away amongst the palms and maze of the streets of bou-denib it came faint and hoarse and defiant through the soft desert night what a terrible war-song said an officer what soldiers said another hark how the music carries said the first you can hear them singing it yet yes they were singing it yet for the fragment of the eighty knew that dixie pasha was in paradise with allah and mohammed and the bulk of his spahis and they were singing his song as they carried his body to its tomb the following morning at daybreak a shell tore a hole in the minaret of the mosque and then another and another the faithful their hearts full of fanaticism and greed for spoil charged forth across the plain where dixie pasha and his left-handed eighty had died the shells burst among them as they huddled together the machine-guns swept them down like meadow-grass before the scythe and when thousands of them lay dead and the shells had shattered the town they submitted themselves mohammed jebbour had disappeared so they sat down to wait until another holy one might bring the message from allah and mohammed to destroy the nasrani for the patience and faith of an arab are endless bynami q hudson maxim editors note-the name of hudson maxim author of the accompanying series of dynamite stories is perhaps the most distinguished in the development of high explosives and kindred inventions first to make smokeless powder in the united states he has worked with dynamite maximite stabilite and motorite with torpedoes and rams with projectiles and armor-plate with automatic guns and detonating fuses as a veritable familiar of these grim agents of destruction long the most famous inventor in his field he has gathered many an anecdote of explosion though some of these stories make saturnine sport of death they are unique in their crisp dramatic quality and adventure is fortunate in giving them to its readers the singular good fortune of an english gentleman t so happened that during a tour of inspection seven of us were together going over the works on entering the guncotton dry-house i noticed a strong odor of nitric acid out of here-quick i cried the place is going to blow up there were perhaps a hundred pounds of dry guncotton in the room at the time spread out in pans as was afterward learned the foreman being in a hurry for the guncotton had turned live steam into the pipes instead of circulating hot water through them as instructed we were barely out of the room when the guncotton burned with a flash wrecking the building and setting fire to the fragments i was just congratulating myself that no one had been injured by the explosion when it was discovered that one of the party the englishman the even tenor of whose way nothing could accelerate or disturb who feared nothing had not quite made up his mind in time to get out of the room before the flash occurred on seeing him emerge at last from the zone of destruction i was horror-stricken for apparently every hair had been burned from his head and face while shreds of skin hung from his hands and cheeks and brow the dark portions of his eyes even were white under the influence of the dreadful shock he had undergone nevertheless the englishmans usual phlegmatic manner was wholly unruffled and he spoke in his conventional voice hardly tinged with enthusiasm i say mr maxim you know its not often one has the chance to witness what actually occurs by jove living bombs an american reporter who was with the japanese during the manchurian campaign told me the following story column after column of japanese had assaulted a russian position the capture of which was exceedingly desirable column after column of the brave little fellows were swept down by the unerring gun-fire  adventure of the russians but each time a few japanese would scale the works and go over them only to be slain by the russians inside there was a lull for a short space and the reporter thought as doubtless did the russians that the japanese had given up the task when suddenly a troop of perhaps a hundred japanese rushed forward without arms in a widely scattered line onward they flew toward the russian camp and as they went up there was a blaze of the russian rifles and half the japanese column disappeared with a flash and a tremendous report they had explodedi each of them had been loaded with an infernal machine hung across his breast and across his back upon his shoulders so that when struck by a bullet he would explode and hurl death and destruction all around him the russians were so astounded so paralyzed by the spectacle and by the unexpectedness of it that they ceased firing while the remaining living bombs scaled the ramparts and leaped in among their enemies who instantly vacated the place flying like rats from a sinking ship dynamites freak a contractor who does business up in new york state told me the following story a carload of nitro-gelatin dynamite had been shipped to him but was held up in a freight-house for a day or two before delivery one night there was an alarm of fire looking out he wras astounded to see that it was the freight-house burning knowing that his carload of dynamite would be sure to explode he started to run to the scene in all haste to warn the firemen and others to keep far away from the inevitable explosion when suddenly there was a great burst of flame which shot high into the sky and flared out bright and wild in all directions sending up an enormous column of smoke but this fierce combustion lasted only a few minutes and then subsided he knew that his dynamite had burned up and curiously enough without exploding he met the fire-chief after the conflagration and they spoke of the fire the chief remarked that there must have been some very combustible freight on one of the cars burned he said that when the fire first started the firemen played a full stream of water on this car but it did not do any good the car burned so fast and so fiercely that they had to rush away for their lives or they would have been consumed by the intense heat and he wondered what it could be that would burn so savagely when told that it was a carload of dynamite he felt like a man who discovers the next day that he had walked along the edge of a high precipice at night although dynamite in such quantities as a carload would be almost certain to explode sometimes even that quantity will take fire and burn up completely without exploding while at other times a single stick of dynamite when ignited will detonate the dog that ate dynamite in the early nineties i was experimenting with a new fulminate compound as a detonator for fuses in high-explosive projectiles the compound consisted of fulminate of mercury gelatinated with guncotton one of my workmen had a pup of a miscellaneous breed which would eat anything under the sun that he could masticate one day his master gave him about half a pound of this fulminate compound another of the workmen put some metallic sodium and dry fulminate into a gelatin capsule stuck this into the end of a quintuple dynamite cap wrapped the whole thing in a piece of meat and calling the dog out into the field made him stand up and speak for it then he dropped it into the dogs throat and it was swallowed at a gulp the next instant the latter workmans own dog which he prized very highly came upon the scene and entered into a very brisk wrestling-bout with the dog that had been charged before he could call him away there was a terrific explosion and both dogs instantly vanished from this vale of tears the race with death among the many dynamite-plants that hang upon the verdant hills of new jersey there is one which stands somewhat apart from the railroad and the dynamite has to be carted to the station over dynamite stories  the highway at one point the highway passes close to the edge of a precipice of considerable height at the bottom of whose abrupt ragged sides nestles a pleasant villa owned by a wealthy new york business man i had just paid a visit to this factory of explosives and was walking leisurely along the road at a distance of perhaps a hundred yards ahead of me there was one of the dynamite wagons moving two tons of dynamite to the railroad the driver had recently purchased a couple of fresh horses which he pronounced a spanking pair they were rather restive and shied at everything they saw but the driver was a brave fellow and a strong one and he had no fear of being unable to control them all at once under the impulse of a gust of wind a newspaper flared up in front of them quick as a flash they bolted rushing headlong the bits held firmly between their teeth while the high-piled load of dynamite swayed from side to side menacingly as the wagon took the short curves of the road at this instant the foreman of the dyna-mite-works flashed by driving a pair of horses to an empty wagon he had observed the plight of the driver of the dynamite wagon and was lashing his horses in a mad pursuit although the foremans team was inferior still his wagon was empty and he was soon neck and neck with the runaway horses for several hundred yards it was a close race neither one achieving any appreciable advantage over the other nearer and nearer were they coming to the precipice which yawned iust where the road turned sharply to the right still on and on they flew when in a moment of advantage the foreman leaped from his wagon full upon the neck and head of the nigh horse of the runaway pair and brought the team to a standstill within less than fifty feet of the precipice and directly over the villa i have mentioned had not this driver possessed both the presence of mind and the athletic qualifications necessary coupled with great daring that load of dynamite must inevitably have gone over the precipice as the horses struck the curve little the peaceful occupants of the villa under the hill imagined what a calamity at that fearful moment overhung them the loaded chinaman during the russo-japanese war a certain officer of the czar who was an impatient overbearing person and a great martinet had a chinese servant whom he treated with the utmost harshness one of his favorite methods of inflicting punishment for offenses was to order the chinaman to leave his presence and as the fellow went to give him a hard kick the chinaman aired his grievances one day to a japanese spy whom he took to be a brother chinaman the jap suggested padding the seat of the chinamans trousers to prevent further contusions and this was done the padding being furnished by the jap a rubber hot-water bag was filled with nitroglycerin and percussion caps were placed in positions where they would be exploded by any sudden blow the unfortunate chinaman was wholly unaware of the nature of the padding at the next meeting of the russian with his servant the poor oriental inadvertently spilled some tea upon the officers new uniform the enraged master proceeded to dismiss the chinaman from his presence in the usual way but with somewhat more precipitation one of the officers legs was blown off one arm was crushed to pulp four ribs were broken and it was more than a day before he was restored to consciousness when he did come to he found himself a prisoner in a japanese hospital having been left behind by the retreating russians as to the chinaman himself poor fellow he never knew that he had been loaded between the tiers the cold-storage plant of a dynamite-factory blew up and sent a rain of large stones over the countryside to an astonishing distance in a dynamite-magazine half a mile away there was piled tier on tier of high explosives one of the flying stones descended through the steel roof of this magazine as if opposed by nothing stronger than paper it dropped between two of the piles of boxed high explosives and penetrated the floor the diameter of that stone as they found when they dug it out of the floor was just eleven inches the space between the tiers was just fourteen inches   adventure the only way was once called in as an expert to visit a dynamite-plant where a new form of high explosive was being manufactured instead of the ordinary nitroglycerin dynamite this consisted of a mixture of chlorate of potash sulphur charcoal and paraffin wax the inventor of it had concocted the reassuring name xx safety dynamite unfortunately this safety mixture went off unexpectedly with no apparent cause and drove a crowbar deftly through the head of one of the workmen this unscheduled performance awakened the apprehension of the president of the company who was also the chief backer and he grew suspicious as to the exact amount of safety in the mixture on that account i was summoned and the president himself accompanied me to inspect the plant when we were close to the factory a sudden explosion occurred which shook the earth for miles and a tremendous pall of smoke instantly covered the sky going on after a moment of stunned pause we found that the site of the plant was now one vast crater around which lay a litter of debris a number of men had been in the factory at the time of the catastrophe now the sole survivor was walking busily about the crater with a basket on his arm picking up bits of something from the ground here and there as he observed us he spoke casually i cant find much of the boys i guess youll have to plow this ground if you want to bury em the bomb and the train one of the most anxious moments that i ever experienced was during some experiments in throwing aerial torpedoes from a four-inch cannon at maxim these torpedoes were about four feet in length charged with a very powerful high explosive and armed with a detonating fuse we had successfully fired several of them into a sand-butt where they exploded with great violence there were six of them five had been fired and the sixth was loaded into the gun ready to be discharged when a passenger train hove in sight and was passing us about a thousand feet away when the gun was fired we had no idea of there being any danger to the train as its position was at right-angles to the line of fire and each of the preceding projectiles had behaved so well but this time the torpedo glanced from the sand-butt and went after that train we stood paralyzed with dread as we saw it pass over the train close to the roof of a car and strike in the swamp just beyond it perhaps a couple of hundred feet behind the track an inverted cone of black earth shot up followed by a dull sound in imagination we had witnessed a frightful catastrophe the wreck of a passenger train with fearful loss of life and all the horror of our own resultant predicament now that the danger was past the even tenor of our way did take on a new relish what objects we are after all of the mercy of chance patriots self-doomed during the russo-japanese war more than one of the czars warships disappeared without leaving a trace i received the following narrative somewhat indirectly and for that reason i do not dare to vouch for its truth its origin as i was given to understand was a japanese officer who revealed the facts while in a mood more confidential than is customary among his kind this officer held a command at the time on board a torpedo-boat in the flotilla there was a torpedo-boat that carried neither guns or torpedoes for that matter air-compressors and every mechanical device not absolutely essential to the navigation of the craft had been removed to lighten it it was then loaded with the most deadly explosives to the fullest capacity that it could carry at high speed next a call was issued for volunteers to make up the small crew necessary for navigating the boat the japanese officer declared that ten times the number required offered themselves despite the fact that they were wrell aware that those who voyaged in this vessel went to certain death the flotilla was steaming slowly along a short distance out at sea from port arthur in the dead of night when the huge gray bulk of a russian warship loomed up in the dark just in front the dynamite-laden torpedo-boat which in itself constituted an enormous floating mine made a dash dynamite stories  head-on then veered abruptly just as she went alongside at that instant the doomed japanese crew sprang their mine the explosion blew in the whole side of the huge warship and hurled her decks and guns high in air she went down in fragments like a rain of stones the patriotic death of the japanese was accomplished in the same moment such bravery in the service of their country may have been equaled in history but certainly it has never been excelled breaking his nerve just back upon the hills that rise up from the southern shores of lake hopatcong there is one of the most important dynamite-works in the country james wentworth began his labors there first as an errand-boy at the age of twelve soon after the works started it was his brag that he had grown up with the works but that he had never gone up with them when by some freak of chance a packing-house or a nitroglycerin apparatus would be blown to the four winds of heaven spraying wreckage of men and timber over the whole celestial concave jim had no lack of courage he had worked in every department of the business had made nitroglycerin nitro-gelatin and had become one of the most skilful dyna-mite-packers as he did piece-wrork he made money rapidly one day at a church strawberry festival he was drawn into the vortex of that swirling passion-love-and married the young wife importuned him to give up the dynamite business as he had already laid up sufficient money to start him in another field yielding to her wishes he gave notice that his resignation was to take effect at the end of two weeks on the third day of the period of his notice on the advent of the noon-hour he was seized with an uncontrollable impulse to take his dinner-pail and himself out of the packing-house where he was working he said afterward that he got to thinking suppose this packing-house should blow up what would become of susie-to say nothing of his own dispersion he went to the top of a little knoll to eat his dinner in full view of the packing-house continuing his pessimistic reflections the place began to look suspicious for the first time in his life he felt fear on a sudden that packing-house became a white dazzling ball of flame and he was knocked down by the concussion he told the superintendent that the three days he had served on his notice must suffice he had lost his nerve flying squid lay in harbor  i j she had been doing it too long  i the masters of prowling harbor i craft had fallen mechanically into the habit of saluting with the friendliness of old neighbors henry had made himself hopelessly unpopular with his superior officers by entirely unnecessary discoveries as to the growth of sea-weed on the schooners sides the mental barometric pressure of captain julius moses was low he looked with a gloomy eye at the log wherein mr william bowsun set forth continually and faithfully with no attempt to disguise a great truth by puerile variety of wording  frates scares so ends this day frates were scares because business was scares business was scares because the ant-heap of uncle sams and john bulls and jean crapauds and john chinos was at one of its chronic stages when each monomaniac ant had labored frantically at carrying rubbish into the hill till no ant wanted anything that any other ant had the ant that made shoes had made more shoes than there were feet the ant that made combs had underestimated entirely the preponderating majority of bald-headed ants the iron-mongering ant had produced more frying-pans than there were omelets even the financier ant had attained the feat of producing more stock certificates than there were fools that sort of thing is known by the human ants as business depression or financial stringency then financiers who have worked on the simple ethics that sufficient for the day is to skin through it fail to skin through and their golden hides are hung up as trophies by wiser financiers banks discover with ever-fresh amazement that when depositors stop bringing money there is no money and they count their securities and find them insecurities then the flying squid and other engines of human commerce sit idle and the engineers of the engines have time to listen to words of wisdom captain julius moses of the flying squid read everything that was printed undismayed by the amount of it hoping to get a great light on why frates were scares henerys literary success  unfortunately financial experts and newspapers use the occult form of speech so justly popular with persons who write sonnets furthermore it was discouraging when he found an excellent explanation to pick up the next paper and find an explanation still more excellent but entirely different bill bowsun shook his ornately carved but somewhat square head disapprovingly when captain moses laid before him the anthology of wisdom whats that there law of supply and demand as theyre talkin about he grumbled where is it here be we waitin for freight were a demand aint we why dont that there law bring that there supply o freight  captain moses struck by this clear point of view pulled his little beard and considered ill tell you why said he brightening  here it is bill this paper says that supply always in-ex-or-ably follows demand-no that aint it here it is this other paper here it says that demand follows supply you see now dont you oh yes i see i see responded mr bowsun its easy if the wind didnt blow the flying squids sails wouldnt be no use and if the flying squid didnt have sails the blowin of the wind wouldnt be no use i know one thing though that feller as said that supply only follers demand he never seen henery and i know another thing that other feller as said demand follers supply let him tell me why there aint a demand for fleas captain moses mused its a deep subject bill its deep i cant rightly explain it but its got something to do with financial stuff listen to this mr bowsuns eyes fixed themselves rigidly in the direction of the wide blue skies while captain moses read a long article in which a lately talented financier whose bank had failed declared that the salvation of the human race depended on an elastic currency when he concluded he looked expectantly at the mate that large marine vertebrate continued to search the zenith with the earnestness of a zoologist looking for a flock of angels captain moses waited hopefully knowing from experience that in this attitude mr bowsun often gave birth to a great clear thought slowly the mate brought his eyes back to earth at last with a visible effort as of one unscrewing something with main strength i wonder said he how long itd take that feller to get somethin real off his mind that aint a bad idee though that there elastic currency-a sort of money near as i can make out that can be in our own pants pockets and in the other fellers at the same time that feller ought to build a ship that could be in two ports to once take my adwice capn moses take my adwice and dont waste time readin them sort o yarns them bankers knowts even less than them newspapers and them newspapers knows even less than them bankers and that said mr bowsun pausing to reflect long and deeply  seems almost unpossible too but its so and the only one as knows less nor both of em is the guvment captain moses sidled off mr bowsun was prone to become discursive on the subject of the government though he based his reasoning less on wide study than on his personal recollection of an injustice once perpetrated by a constable he had built up a complete political philosophy on it despite the united thought of newspapers financiers governments and the captain of the flying squid the financial stringency and the schooner continued in statu quo the commander discharged the crew and spent most of his time ashore searching vainly for a non-existent something that a non-existent somebody might wish to send to a non-existent somewhere mr bowsun left aboard and unable to distract his mind by teaching sailors the way they should go devoted much thought to henry he had daily inspirations as to ships work he discovered two tasks where only one had been before all day long he surrounded henry with tender solicitude undeterred by the fact that he wras openly ungrateful mr bowsuns paternal care was the more distasteful because henry had laid in a stock of fishing-tackle in order as he explained in an incautious moment to mr bowsun to pass the time away it harrowed him that mr bowsun relieved him so entirely of the necessity he lowered his lines surreptitiously only to find them strangely missing when he went to inspect them he could not forbear uttering a rebuke fishin said mr bowsun thoughtfully taking hold of henrys ear fishin is  adventure cruel henery cruel you dont ketch no fish and you mess up the deck with bait its cruel youre awful kind-hearted all at once squealed henry how about bein cruel to me ah henery replied mr bowsun with a kindly smile thats different nobody as lias your interests at heart should be afraid of any amount of croolty to make a man out o you a nice thing youd grow up to be continued he feeling absent-mindedly for henrys other ear if we didnt bring you up right lord lord whats a ear compared with a good charik-ter-or even a dozen ears maybe said henry viciously as he fled if they was ears like yours that looks like fenders but you leave mine alone the incident made excessive tension in an already strained situation and it was a real relief to mr bowsun when captain moses came on board in the midst of his immediately subsequent sufferings henry comforted himself slightly with the reflection that it was two against one and when his course of instruction in discipline was finished he fled below to plan darkly at first his offended thoughts revolved only vast and tragic vengeances such as had been wreaked by his most pleasing heroes amid the applause of nations but his cooler mind remembered that he had to consider not only the deserts of captain moses and bill bowsun but the important interests of another person that person being named henry moses these considerations brought a nobler purpose in their train he would slip away without a word of farewell vanish without a word of reproach his heart almost lost its bitterness when he pictured the awakening upbraiding consciences of the erring men he thought with something akin to a great compassion how they would yield to horror when they missed him in the morning and how passionately their grief would increase when they found that they had to get their own breakfast henry had a stern temperament yet he felt an unwonted tenderness for the two mariners sleeping in calm unconsciousness of the blow that was about to fall snore away snore away he muttered as he tiptoed around gathering his possessions snore away youll snore different when you wake up it did not require many minutes for him to pack henry was of a large reasonableness as to the requirements of the toilet a scarlet necktie a shirt a comb and four of his latest learners hand-books on piracy sufficed him light in baggage and mind he crept to the deck and gained the wharf he paused just long enough to shake a fist at the schooner then the form of a dauntless youth evidently one accustomed to danger and privation might have been seen swinging from the deserted waterside toward the beating heart of the great city ii on the third evening thereafter the form of a youth evidently one who had been through dangers and privations might have been seen wandering at random through the beating heart of the great city henry moses had found the great city to be only a flying squid on a large and dirty scale full of bill bowsuns harboring an invincible ignorance and an obstinate animosity against talent he had offered his services in almost every branch of human endeavor and they had been declined with almost breathless haste the only thing for which the beating heart of the city beat at all warmly was his money henrys eye gazing misanthropically at the abodes of avarice was arrested by a brilliantly lighted entrance into which many people were crowding on a placard alongside he saw the words admission free he made his way in at once without troubling himself to scan the less important remarks that followed announcing that miss alma grool would deliver an address on the wrongs of civilization miss alma grool was a devoted righter of wrongs she was an anti-militarist a dress-reformer an anti-vivisectionist a prohibitionist a mothers helper an anti-cremationist a hydropath an ibsenist a socialist an anti-x-rayist and a vegetarian she upheld the baconian theory of shakespeare and the righteousness of a tax on dogs she was a spiritualist and a spelling reformer she opposed the germ theory of disease and the nude in art miss grool was a flattish lady except in breadth and thickness her tall form was a convincing refutation of the geometrical maxim that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points she was so henerys literary success  entirely modern that she referred to last year as the superstitious past she always carried an umbrella as in all other professions the financial stringency had caused a business depression in the righting of wrongs persons who had been lavishing money cheerfully to enable her to fight race-suicide or vaccination discovered suddenly that in finance investing and divesting are synonymous terms miss grool found herself forced to add some new wrongs to her repertoire and her lecture on the wrongs of civilization was to launch them her placard which stated that admission was free did not mention that a collection would be taken up inside after the lecture many previous experiences had told her that persons who have wrongs are willing to pay attention but not money henry was incensed when he discovered what the free admission admitted him to his first just impulse was to walk out his second impulse was to take a nap a shuffling of feet awakened him from a gratifying dream of captain moses and mr bowsun sobbing bitterly in each others arms on the lonely deck of the flying squid he perceived without regret that he had slumbered throughout the entire lecture and that the sordid audience was hurrying to escape the collection-box but miss grool had posted collectors at all the exits henry moses was entirely free from the weakness of liberality he observed that the collectors were large and disquietingly successful glancing around him with the keen eye of the trained navigator he spied a neglected side-door hurried through it and discovered too late that it led into a room full of people before he could retreat he found himself face to face with miss alma grool herself holding a levee of admirers and fellow-righters miss grool pounced on all strangers who ventured within pouncing distance and her pouncing distance was kan-garooian she pounced on henry during the next ten minutes he was mentally hove to in a conversational fog from which he emerged to hear his own voice recounting to miss grool the sad history of his life it was not a true history but it was very interesting henry never had read byron but he could have done so with the instant appreciation of a kindred soul he poured forth a simple artless tale of great wrongs on the seven seas that evoked gratified grief from miss grool and her colleagues poor boy said miss grool i will take up your case just let me have the names of the villains henrys prudence bitted the champing jaws of his pegasus the names of the flying squid and her commanders were his secrets of state he created a captain and mate instantly and invented a steamship to fit his story adding hastily that the vessel had sailed to lisbon let em go said he magnanimously all i want is to earn a honest living earning a living is ignoble pronounced an advanced disciple with baggy trousers and a tightly buttoned frock coat mankind should work not for a gross living but an ideal i got to eat said henry briefly earthling sighed a fat lady in a green dress trimmed with pink miss grool raised her hand come to my hearth said she alma grool will be your friend she hurried henry to her hearth which was a hearth-less flat and as soon as she had him safe she produced pen and paper and declared herself ready henry gazed at her unsympathetically i-we-can make a splendid series of articles about the wrongs of sailors said miss grool persuasively they would advert- miss grool coughed help to reform the ship business think of the good you will do henrys face assumed the cold suspicion of a codfish examining a poorly baited hook and expressed decided disapprobation miss grool accustomed to angling for philanthropists much warier fish than codfish hastily put a new bait on there will be some money in it she hinted i dont want to get in no trouble said henry i dont want my name to get out nor i dont want to give the names of the captains and ships that i had trouble with they might try to get me back because i run away and so im what they call a deserter at sea miss grool had not felt the least desire to destroy henrys value as an asset by giving his name to a world of predatory reporters she intended to monopolize the wrongs of sailors herself she assented graciously to the young mariners conditions  adventure the newspapers viewed miss grool as a precious utility they used her impartially as a subject for attack and cartoon or as a valued contributor according to the fitful fever of their circulation her offer of a series of articles about the wrongs of sailors was seized eagerly by a newspaper that had the largest circulation on earth but was hard beset by others that had it also when henry saw the first article illustrated with intrepid fancy and crowned with volcanic ranges of head-line type his artistic soul responded to the call he thrilled miss grool with tales of cruelty and crime vengeance inspired him where imagination faltered and though he invented ever new characters and ships he impressed on each of his sea-villains some noteworthy and treasured characteristic of captain julius moses or mr william bowsun ill those two ignorant of treachery had spent harrowing days seeking the lost they searched public institutions not neglecting even an old ladieshome and the colored orphan asylum while mr bowsun showed especial enthusiasm about madhouses finally in an ill-starred moment they had offered rewards in all the papers and thereafter their lives were blighted day and night by the clamorous arrival of small boys dragged to the flying squid by hopeful captors who insisted indignantly on being paid for their trouble while the furious youths expressed themselves in terse pointed words after five long days full of trouble they rested on the flying squid during a blessed interval that was unbroken temporarily by the arrival of new boys captain moses idly scanning a newspaper spoke pathetically of henry calling to mind many shining qualities that he had overlooked in the days of the past even mr bowsun stifled within himself the still small voice of candor and ventured on the cautious statement that henry probably meant well suddenly captain moses stared hard at a headline his mouth opened bill said he and gulped bill listen to this heres something about ships its written by a chap no-i guess its a she-named grool and he-she says that the facts are from a young sailor its about cruelty at sea rubbish growled mr bowsun what does people as write and print know about the sea yes but said captain moses hear this his voice rose passionately as he read a few paragraphs that had a strange effect on mr bowsun its a lie roared he let me see that there paper it dont mention your name answered captain moses you let me see bellowed mr bowsun captain moses had been reading some succeeding lines and seemed suddenly reluctant mr bowsun snatched the paper and plodded slowly down the column why heres something about you too he remarked ignoring his superiors outstretched hand he read with careful clearness the cap-tain of the schoo-ner was a lit-tle man with a small brown beard and he spent most of his time-keep-ing his hair combed and his-beard nice-and-trim he talked soft-and low but he was a crim- in-al at heart his-mate- mr bowsun stopped reading aloud and tried to peruse the rest in modest silence captain moses seized the paper and continued with something faintly like satisfaction  -was just the opposite in all except wickedness he used to pull sailors ears out by the roots he was very ignorant and very big and dirty captain moses looked up and said lightly thats you bill what makes ye think that demanded mr bowsun captain moses coughed he leaped hastily to the next paragraph reading a description of the vessel that fitted the flying squid too well to be denied the two looked at each other and said with one voice henry half an hour later they were in the office of the newspaper striving to express themselves in fitting terms a smiling editor listened with kindly toleration i dont know who you are he comforted them when they had exhausted themselves temporarily but i dont see what grievance you have we didnt mention any names you know now for instance did you ever pull a sailors ear out  no roared mr bowsun its a lie or did you knock a man overboard with a punch from a binnacle or a hawe-pipe or whatever it was continued the affable editor henerys literary success  no its all lies lies from beginning to end declared captain moses breathing hard there you are then said the journalist if you want to claim that this article means you why just say so and well send for the police and you can settle it in court and if you didnt do these things like making a poor boy polish brass-work till he got bright green all over from blood-poisoning why then this article doesnt mean you and i wouldnt let it annoy me you know annoy usgasped mr bowsun dont you tell me im annoyed annoyed why thats a insult come away bill come away exclaimed captain moses with somber dignity well go to this miss gruel and get hold of henry thats right gentlemen said the editor with sudden enthusiasm you see her and if you get away with her you let me have your pictures and ill print em on the first page captain moses and bill bowsun earnestly implored the editor to make a certain journey then they tracked miss grools address to its lair in the directory and bearded her in her den as they entered the den they felt sure that they spied the manly form of henry moses vanishing into a rear den but all their indignation was unavailing to extract anything from miss grool at last mr bowsuns precariously sustained patience gave way and he burst forth wistfully i wish you was a man dont let that interfere replied miss grool politely im equal to any man equal to any man repeated mr bowsun backing to the door as if he were choking for fresh air  equal to any man miss porridge leastwise puddin youre equal to a whole ships crew o men and them the most aggrawatin kind as the door closed behind them their alert ears heard a faint snigger that was the unmistakable snigger of henry moses wait till we get hold on him announced bill bowsun lets hurry to the police and get our names in the paper inquired captain moses itd ruin us and what could we do let him alone for a while and well think up something for the time being hes safe thats one comfort ive been real worried about henry bill me im worried a whole lot more about him now responded mr bowsun malevolently iv during the next days henrys fancy made increasing flights and the articles pictured so many utterly lost villains with so many distinctly personal attributes of captain moses and his mate that self-respect forbade them from reading newspapers in each others presence in privacy however they read every line of miss grools articles until at last mr bowsun began to have grave fears that he would lose his mind about this time henry emerging from the apartment house for recreation after his literary labors dodged back only just in time to escape the grip of two immense hairy hands he escaped to the flat and peered from the window to see the immense and hairy owner of the hands waiting patiently below with his eyes fixed on the door an hour later the avenging mr bowsun was waiting still dusk came and mr bowsun was immovable a fixed part of the municipal scenery waiting with the implacable patience of a heart that treasures up a wrong henrys mind dwelling on the waiting avenger lacked its wonted spring that evening when miss grool sat down to continue the sad story of his young life his flow of invention ceased spasmodically he refrained from telling her about the vigil below but she discovered it herself when she happened to glance from the window thats the man that came to see me with another man-a little one she said i wonder what hes doing here hes been hangin around for a couple of days said henry instantly awake to opportunity  maybe hes mad on account of the things youre writing they were angry those two reflected miss grool aloud thats true-so angry they didnt even tell me who they were i wonder whether he means harm henry shook his head gravely as one who does not know but fears the worst miss grool was not a timid creature but when an hour passed and mr bowsun still remained at anchor in the offing she called up the police on the telephone mr bowsuns first intimation of disturb-  adventure ance came from behind in the form of a club applied smartly to his legs with the injunction to move on mr bowsun obeyed instantly but too literally he moved on the policeman the city census was in imminent danger of being reduced by one when a second policeman arrived mr bowsun explained hurriedly that it would take at least three to arrest him bill bowsuns mental arithmetic was poor it required five and each of the five thought that the prisoner was a freak of nature with oaken mauls for hands bill bowsun himself needed repairs but his wrath was so much greater than his pain that he succeeded in climbing half way over the desk in the station house in his effort to speak to the police lieutenant when that official demanded his name altogether he behaved so impatiently that at last the entire police garrison became vexed and deposited him in a cell without insisting on the ceremony of recording his pedi-gree a night in cool solitude restored mr bowsuns mind to its normal lucidity when he was haled forth in the morning he gave his name as john smith landsman a deep device to keep his identity secret from a prying government later in the tragic day he had to listen to a police court justice who spoke with extraordinary freedom and then outwardly a dead calm but inwardly a hurricane he hoisted from his hold a roll of cherished bills and paid a fine that left him financially dismasted captain moses had spent a grievous night searching for his mate and partner it was a moral mustard on the raw surface of his anguish when he beheld mr bowsuns dismantled condition and heard his story united by a great passion they conversed brokenly of the great disasters that they longed to purvey to miss grool and to henry it was a merciful thought of an otherwise thoughtless providence that sent them something to change their train of reflections providences agent had a dark richly-colored face of mahogany and bow legs in hull he was modeled like mr bowsun with a broad bluff bow and immense beam and counter but he had a merry eye that rolled with gleeful recollection of jokes past and with gleeful anticipation of jokes to come whereas mr bowsuns fine eye looked fixedly into gloom ship ahoy roared he rolling to the gangway this is the a b hawser master retired tumble up ye lubbers tumble up captain moses and mr bowsun tumbled up and led their guest into the cabin where captain moses produced a bottle and glasses no thank you said hawser master firmly he held out his glass and looked at it with surprise when he found that captain moses had poured liquor into it with a sigh he drank it off and settled himself to listen while captain moses and mr bowsun told him the tale of their griefs at certain passionate scenes he shook with feeling that he tried to suppress he shook for a decidedly long period after they had concluded well well said he funny how-no never mind drop henry for a while and lets get down to business ive got a cargo for ye shipmates-not common cargo either freight and passengers and me- ill go along im going along as a matter of business but and he shook again and slapped bill bowsun joyfully on the back ding me id go along even if i had to pay my passage just to-to see something whats the something inquired mr bowsun viewing mr hawser pessimistically your face bill when you see the passengers roared mr hawser slapping mr bowsuns back with a stroke like a deck-hatch falling the mate edged away he and captain moses looked questioningly at their merry friend retired he however seemed suddenly far away he was sitting in deep reflection his eye fixed thoughtfully at his empty glass captain moses reached for the bottle fill it up good capn moses said mr bowsun with solicitous hospitality fill it up good sos capn hawser wont have to pass his glass so ofen captain hawser drained the glass he smacked his lips he drew forth a handkerchief not quite half as large as a mainsail and wiped his mouth then a sudden thought appeared to strike him what did you mean by that remark just now bill he demanded mean asked bill mean why capn hawser i only meant to give ye rum as fast as you can drink it least- henerys literary success  ways concluded bill warned by captain hawsers disapproving glance that something was wrong leastways of course not as fast as that as fast as we could give it ye dont ye see what bill meant capn hawser interposed captain moses helpfully was that no matter how much rum you-no he didnt mean that neither of course here hold out your glass and ill show you what he meant  no thank ye  answered captain hawser stubbornly he held out his glass and cried hold enough at frequent intervals till the law of liquids prevented the glass from holding any more now said he after testing the liquor carefully now that bill has explained what he meant by saying something that might have meant something different ill tell ye about this cargo and you can say if ye want it or not but i guess you want it why capn gaffers that sails the cockatoo steamer he told me yesterday that freights was that scarce that hed take a cargo of artesian wells if he could get it the cockatoo said bill dont look as if she could carry anything much heavier well continued captain hawser the cockatoo wont get this cargo anyway now these passengers theyre not common passengers theyre worse yes sir theyre worse theyre the finest lot of assorted chandlery in the way of cranks that ever came together in any place excepting a lunatic asylum why some of em bill are worse cranks than even you each one of em believes in a different kind of crankery all his own and the only thing they ever managed to agree on was this trip theyre going down to the antilles where the head-crank owns an island and theyre going to start a colony there and invite all the cranks that itll hold to come down and live there when theyve fixed things up and theyve hired me to fit em out and be a sort of a nurse to em till they get settled and im hiring you to take the happy family and their stuff down there moses old boy the head-crank hes got piles of money itll pay you well but its hustle hustle hustle shipmates ship a crew haul down the bay and anchor and ill be sending the freight all aboard by day after to-morrow captain moses nodded brought pen and ink and they drew up the papers then a b hawser master retired looked long and earnestly at bill bowsun slapped his back before mr bowsun could dodge and escaped to the deck v the days that followed were so full of labor that neither captain or mate of the flying squid had time to brood over the malicious articles that continued to flow from the brain of henry moses and the pen of alma grool but whenever opportunity offered they cheered each other with gorgeous word-pictures of their intentions if they ever got hold of the erring youth at last the holds were filled with the provisions clothing implements seeds books portable houses typewriters and printing presses destined for the colony now for them passengers said mr bowsun  the sooner we get em aboard the sooner well get rid on em again thats not the right spirit bill captain hawser rebuked him its a bad spirit and un-christian you wont get any improvement out of the vyage if you look at it in that way bill and i was hoping that the passengers would do you a lot of good theres the lady i was telling you about bill that eats everything raw see what the flying squid would save if you and capn moses and the crew would only be willing to learn you wouldnt have to carry a cook mr bowsun grunted and then theres the boss of the gang nutt thats got a hundred thousand million dollars or so continued captain hawser cheerily you make friends wuth him bill and hell never get tired telling you how fine it is to be poor take that man around moses and introduce him to your crew and theyll refuse to take any wages see if they dont yes growled bill then why dont he give his money away ah responded captain hawser there you go again you know wiiat i told you bill he says money is such a curse that he wouldnt think of passing it on well said bill morosely let him stay away from me if he dont ill curse him and not with money neither in this unsympathetic mood mr bow-  adventure sun and captain moses paid only formal attention to the passengers when captain hawser brought them alongside in a tug about dusk their appearance justified mr bowsuns gloomiest prognostications they were only few in number but they filled the flying squid with shrill sounds and obtrusive personality and within five minutes they had succeeded in sitting or standing on every cable and rope that mr bowsuns men were trying to haul he wiped his brow with his sleeve and rushed frantically at a lady in smoked glasses who was reposing in the middle of a loop of the main-sheet scat miss he yelled sheer off the sheet quick or youll be aloft think of it he growled to captain hawser who helped him pick her up and disentangle her barely in time to save her from a skyward trip feet first i told her as plain as could be and she just stood there and never tried to move and that there nutt capn hawser ill run aboard him if he dont go below listen to him givin orders as if he was the skipper captain hawser beheld the signs of gathering epic grief in mr william bowsun with a skill that only chicken-breeders or pig-drovers could have appreciated justly he gathered his flock and half drove half led it below ive got em busy settling their belongings bill he reported when he emerged now you get all ready to sail i got one more run to make ashore for some others that couldnt get ready before this and i didnt have time to tell em the name of the ship or where she was so ill have to go and get em well be aboard before turn of tide to-night and the minute we come back you can start he reached his broad arm forth fondly and shook bill from bow to maintop with an affectionate blow on the back ill eat on deck said bill to captain moses when the dinner call sounded and youd better do the same it wouldnt be polite to them down there replied captain moses longingly  itd be less polite to go down-leastways so far as i be concerned announced mr bowsun briefly that there nutt- all right bill all right answered captain moses ill send your dinner up and ill eat with em-unless unless bill and he laid his hand in friendly pressure on the mates arm unless you should need me you could send me word about five minutes after dinners served you know bill i dont want you to have everything to attend to all alone oh i wont need you replied bill with a generosity that struck captain moses as hypocritical if not heartless he sighed and pulled his little beard as he went below left to himself mr bowsun exhorted his crew feverishly and had the flying squid ready for sea long before the lights of the returning tug came in sight ship ahoy bellowed the voice of a b hawser master retired lend a hand here he tumbled on deck and rolled to bills side i want you to meet the passengers bill said he his arm swung fondly at mr bowsun but found only empty air for his friend had side-stepped with unexpected agility mr hawser clutched him and dragged him to the side here they are bill he whispered with a strange quiver in his voice here they are the light fell on a form that came over the side from the tugs deck it was the form of a tall fiattish lady behind her urged by strong arms came a smaller form that showed signs of a sudden coyness and reluctance dont faint bill dont faint shouted captain hawser bursting into a glad roar sudden joy sometimes acts that way he turned to the side and snatched the small form welcome aboard the flying squid  he said breathlessly miss grool mr bowsun mr bowrsun mr henry moses but mr bowysun wtas busy already with mr henry moses can a man be true  m winifred graham  jfuthor of the vision at the savoy synopsis maldio the progressive and beloved young ruler of the small european kingdom of lam-basa is poisoned by count bistoff at the orders of maldios stepmother queen horatia so that her own son the puppet gisdel may rule bistoff secretly loyal to maldio only drugs him and later revives and rescues him from the tomb along with dugdale an english secret agent buried alive for claiming maldio was not really dead maldio demanding a respite from kingly cares before claiming his throne goes to england and secretly marries loti the girl he loves his identity being known only to her meanwhile gisdel has become infatuated with caroline de lisle ail actress thereby enraging liis mother the queen discovers the tomb is empty suspects bistofi and sends zavair to summon him bistofi makes excuses zavair reports having seen dugdale alive at bistoffs home chapter xxx the palace of a thousand fears mavair had dealt the queen a crushing blow which momentarily scattered her senses in low confidential tones she gasped out trembling questions could he swear to the man did he feel completely convinced the face was dugdales and no other you see she added this means that count bistofi whom i trusted implicitly is a traitor my reason can scarcely grasp such depths of perfidy we can bear the animosity of foes but when a friend turns to rend the hand which ever showed him kindness then indeed the vengeance of heaven should fall on the vile judas of to-day zavair thought of horatias many dark deeds long years of tyranny rose up in the mind of this man who knew of her secret cruelty he could not wonder that a so-called friend should prove false what had she ever done to win loyalty or affection the silent brigade and their impassive chief served the queen in deadly fear they were true because to be otherwise meant death he answered the burning questions put to him in nervous accents yes he could swear to what he had seen and count bistoffs refusal to answer the royal summons spoke for itself undoubtedly the court physician was a traitor the distracted woman put both hands to her head she felt as if her brain were bursting i must be left to think she murmured you may withdraw zavair but hold yourself in readiness to fulfil immediately any orders received within the next few hours i must hold counsel with the king keep all your men together throughout the night fully armed yes your majesty   adventure the queen held out her shaking hand and kneeling zavair touched it lightly with his lips rising without another word he silently retired carrying in his heart the full knowledge of the deadly fear which assailed that stricken figure bent with grief as the door closed horatia opened her desk and drew out a large portrait of count bistoff she gazed fiercely at the speaking features depicted with their most pleasing smile  put not your trust in any child of man  she muttered between clenched teeth  no man is true not even he who breathed devotion who whispered flattery outwardly swearing to fulfil my every wish and desire-even to the planning of mal-dios death what can it all mean if dugdale lives is it possible maldio himself has been taken from the tomb and revived by bistoffs skill she looked wildly round the room and her ears were intently alert to every sound the gentle murmur of the evening breeze stirring the curtains appeared as the warning voice of phantom visitors the palace became haunted by a thousand fears by some strange trick of fancy it developed into a mausoleum containing the spirits of horatias victims not only maldio and the english spy returned to convict the guilty woman of hideous atrocities forms from the past long-forgotten tortured blood-drenched faces materialized in the suffocating atmosphere horatia gasped for breath the very jewels on her neck were heavy as the chains once binding the prisoners whose fate she had secretly decided she turned deadly cold then hot as fire as she tried to steady her brain to see clearly but still the dreaded specters of her tortured fancy confronted her in the luxurious and familiar room i shall go mad she told herself if i stay here alone i must have speech with gisdel he must know at once that bistoff has failed us and that dugdale lives possibly a serious situation may bring him to a better mind and rouse the latent good in him sometimes the young see further than the old he spoke of danger he knew instinctively there was trouble ahead in the hour of tribulation he will stand by his mother comforting herself with this thought she hurried to gisdeps room and knocked cau- tiously on the door receiving no answer she shook the handle and finding it locked against her rapped loudly on the oak paneling once more she listened but no movement within showed that the sleeper heard he must be awake but he is sulky because he especially asked me not to disturb him she thought he little guesses all i have to tell bending down she spoke in a penetrating voice gisdel she called gisdel open the door it is i your mother we are in danger come quickly  but the words were greeted by deaf ears -or else the room was empty this thought flashed through the queens mind as she tried to force the lock she had suspected he might be joining mademoiselle de lisle after the theater but as yet she had not realized the lateness of the hour as she flung the whole weight of her body against the strongly-fastened door a serv- ant appeared summoned by the unusual commotion in the wide tapestry-decked corridor horatia bade him fetch men to break open the door i fear he is unwell i can get no answer the servant hesitated looking distinctly uncomfortable tell me she added sharply has his majesty left the palace the servant knew well what it meant to displease the queen he had little fear of gisdels wrath since i can but speak the truth he answered humblyyou have judged rightly most gracious queen his majesty drove away half an hour ago from a side entrance the hard line of horatias mouth might have been molded in iron as she listened to the words enough she said go below and order my carriage immediately if your words are correct i shall not forget to reward you have no fear of the kings displeasure you are under my protection a sigh of relief escaped the man as his tall figure vanished down the long corridor in a moment horatia decided how to act she would go herself and fetch gisdel from caroline de lisles house she would tell him that in his official capacity he was instantly required she would also have a can a man be true  word with the brazen woman who was compassing her sons downfall hurriedly the indignant and fear-stricken mother veiled her face in thickly patterned lace the ample draperies of a magnificent cloak completely hid the queens ponderous figure giving no indication of the bitter wo it harbored beneath dazzling folds with stately tread horatia descended the wide staircase her chin held high at a haughty angle her fists clenched she felt she was going forth to war starting out to fight for her only son loved wildly despite his many faults her ladies-in-waiting watched with startled eyes the departure of the queen on this errand of mystery they guessed something unusual had occurred they suspected she was about to follow king gisdel as she reached the open door one of the many attendants in the gorgeous livery of lambasas royal house stepped forward and handed horatia a note on a gold salver instantly she saw it was in bistoffs writing with trembling hands she broke the seal for a moment she could not see the letters as they danced before her eyes the message had no formal opening or courteous ending but the words were written clearly across the counts stamped note-paper this is to warn you that king maldio lives and will shortly return to claim his crown he knows you plotted his death be advised and fly the country with your son before the people rise up and tear you in pieces diarmid bistoff no word of sympathy or regret merely save yourself if you can-the end is at hand the queen tottered slightly then crushing the sheet in nervous fingers moved forward like one dazed and entered the royal carriage the coachman whipped up his horses and drove away at full speed to the brightly illuminated residence wrhere mademoiselle de lisle entertained her birthday guests chapter xxxi carolines king tn buoyant spirits king gisdel sought the radiant star of the stage he came into her presence with glowing eyes that silently spoke his appreciation of her beauty never had caroline appeared more lovely than on this great birthday-night her exquisite figure showed off to perfection a shimmering gown created for her by the most celebrated dress-artist in vienna her wonderfully molded neck and arms gleamed with jewels while a tiara of gems crowned her masses of dark hair every movement expressed the grace which had made her famous as a dancer gisdel basking in the light of her charms felt as if caroline and caroline alone comprised the whole world his kingdom his power home ties and bonds of blood were as nothing compared with this wonderful woman her magnetic personality dominated him with strong hypnotic force he lived only to do her will if she had demanded his whole fortune he felt he would have laid it at her feet never in the past had she held him in so powerful a spell he was no longer master of his own actions the magic of carolines smile bewitched him her whispered words of thanks thrilled him to the core as she pointed to the diamond heart and emerald necklace showing up the pure tints of her naturally fair skin though her lips were rouged she was otherwise guiltless of paint and powder nature having endowed her with a magnificent complexion you must let me present my guests she murmured they are all terribly excited at the prospect of bowing the knee to your majesty she spoke in softly seductive accents but a very keen observer might have traced an underlying note of sarcasm in the murmured words i am in your hands answered gisdel devouring her with infatuated eyes tonight i wish to be as one of you pray let your guests know that all formality is waived i am only carolines king as such i rule or rather am ruled by her to-morrow i shall again be the sovereign of lambasa this evening i am only myself these gracious words of condescension were noised abroad by carolines diplomatic tongue and gisdel was treated merely as a guest of distinction and not as a reigning monarch whose influence might well have sobered the revelries in store many of those assembled at the gorgeous supper had already dined well a fact re-  adventure vealed by their noisy merriment the table was shaped like a horseshoe-for luck caroline declared two large throne-like chairs had been placed at the head for the king and hostess an archway of tall palms waving above these important figures as if especially to distinguish them from the common fry by each plate a double frame held as a gift a portrait of caroline and gisdel the former in dancing dress the latter in coronation robes at the back of the dainty folding case the elaborate menu revealed its appetizing list in the center of the table a tall birthday-cake resembling a wedding-cake in every particular towered upwards in banks of snowy sugar to the vast amusement of the guests twenty colored candles burned their silent watch around the edifice in representation presumably of carolines age well her intimates knew she was nearer thirty if the truth were told and the whispered word passed from mouth to mouth a cunning trick to hoodwink the king so she is adopting the pose of youth to gisdel the scene proved entrancing the shouts of laughter the jests hurled to and fro across the table the atmosphere of bohemian festivity bewildered and enthralled merely to watch caroline was a revelation she remained in touch with all her guests even far away at the end of the horseshoe her laughter rang through the room like rippling music her bright sallies flew like lightning while the words whispered only for gisdels ear were strangely sweet and subtle i am going to make a speech she told him  i mean to propose your health this feast is really yours and they will not be happy unless we have the kings toast gisdel flushed pleasurably already the wine had mounted to his head making him almost as noisy and demonstrative as the surrounding company i dare say you think it is a very great thing to be a king he replied but really i believe you people have a far better time if you came to one of the state banquets at the palace you would be bored to death never the sound of a laugh and nobody speaks above a monotone i assure you i sometimes feel inclined to go to sleep or yawn my head off of course it is all the fault of my mother she insists upon retaining the old stiff regime anything like levity would paralyze her with horror caroline smiled sympathetically i often think of the queen she said and her futile efforts to banish me from lam-basa but for my king and his bold decree that i should be tolerated in the capital i might now be languishing in paris an exile from my native land ah me that would have been a loss for lambasa she acted a kind of mock despair before capping her words with a shout of laughter spontaneous as the mirth of a child rushing out of school gisdel pressed her hand under the table you are like fire he whispered you set me in a flame are you a witch caroline your beauty torments me-i wish you were less beautiful what is that large white ornament quivering on a wire at the top of the cake he bent forward screwing up his eyes for he had always been short-sighted for a moment the hostess hesitated then replied lightly it is a moth to signify night supposed to be hovering over the twenty candles which mark my age a pretty idea-is it not you see i am still something of a child gisdel looked at her sharply with a sudden flash of intelligence i believe he said you meant the moth for me if so you were not far wrong you know i have singed my wings already caroline shook her head and refilled his glass it is time for the speeches she said now we shall be really merry-we shall swim in wine she rose to her feet and a burst of applause greeted the action ladies and gentlemen fill your glasses she cried i rise to propose the toast of the king a wild clapping of hands greeted the words gisdel heard the sound as in a dream he was gazing in mad adoration at the vivacious and smiling speaker king gisdel continued the silvery voice  is with us to-night as a friend he has come privately to prove that despite his illustrious birth and the slavery of a high position he is just a man at heart ready to befriend a woman who dances for her bread carolines words were spoken with dra- can a man be true  matic intensity her flashing eyes looked down on gisdel large lustrous and captivating in their soft radiance-their halfhidden fire yes she repeated it is as my champion he is here and i am proud of his presence i could repeat his generous deeds till daylight but he would never forgive me- and certainly never honor us again with his presence a ripple of laughter broke the tension the guests were glad that caroline had turned to a lighter vein i should like she added to make this feast an annual one-to meet here year after year until my age-candles were too many to burn but since the future is veiled let us think only of the moment let us drink as if this draft were the very elixir of life with warm hearts beating right loyally we toast our most noble and beloved guest king gisdel your admiring subjects wish you well long may you reign as monarch of this land from the lips of all who taste to-night the wine from your royal cellars i give this token of never-dying love and esteem she bent and boldly kissed gisdel on the forehead the unexpected salute sent a rush of crimson to his beaming face and simultaneously his startled eyes caught sight of a tall figure wrapped in a long cloak appearing like a ghost at the far end of the room the waiters and guests thought the newcomer must be a late arrival bidden to the feast but gisdel instantly recognized the shaded cloak with its costly trimmings well he knew the face that was hid beneath those disguising folds of heavily patterned lace in a moment he paled and drew back confused the newcomer advanced slowly toward caroline and the king then as the frantic applause died down and the glasses once more were lowered horatia drew aside her veil and stood glaring at mademoiselle de llsle with a look of fierce hatred and scorn caroline caught her breath but years of training on the stage and her ever-ready wit came instantly to her aid the queen she cried in a loud voice of triumph she has come to join us ladies and gentlemen-the health of the queen  chapter xxxii like an ox to tiie slaughter the look on queen horatias face as mademoiselle de llsle spoke the daring words so paralyzed the assembly that they feared to raise their glasses and drink the toast a sudden hush fell as if indeed some spectral form from another world had appeared to strike terror in the hearts of the guests throughout the length and breadth of the land the queen was cordially hated among carolines friends at the gaily decked table were some of the fiercest revolutionary spirits in lambasa for the king they felt nothing but contemptuous pity but toward the queen they bore a long-nursed and bitter grudge at her door they laid the grievances of overtaxation and unjust rule well they knew that maldios reforms had been hotly contested by his stepmother and in certain circles a growing suspicion as to the cause of his death was secretly rumored those who realized bistoff was on the side of horatias enemies concluded he had possibly discovered some foul play and daily the feeling against the queen grew more vindictive now this tyrannical woman this proud partner of her late husbands throne stood facing a female foe who had boldly appropriated the affections of the king the curious eyes at the table watching caroline and the uninvited intruder grew large with wonder dread and painful anticipation the gay evening had changed suddenly to one of tension and dread tragedy lurked in the air though carolines bold lips still smiled a satirical welcome to the queen-mother who had sought to banish her forever from lambasa the recent news had played havoc with horatias nerves her face was livid with fury her eyes glowed red and bloodshot like balls of fire her voice rose in the sudden hush trembling with passion revealing the frantic agitation which disturbed her mind gisdel she said ignoring caroline and turning to her son i have come for you you are required at the palace on urgent business nothing but the gravest news would have brought me beneath the roof of that low and impudent creature she indicated the dancer with a move- o adventure ment of her hand still keeping her eyes fixed on gisdel as if he alone occupied the crowded room the stinging words of open insult were greeted with a murmur of disapproval but only a streak of scarlet suddenly visible on carolines delicately molded cheeks revealed that she heard gisdel set his lips he felt he could have struck his mother on the mouth for her cruel taunt here he was the guest of the woman he loved and the queen forgetting what she owed to her position throwing aside all conventionality had tracked him in a mad fit of jealousy to spoil his pleasure and revile caroline openly before her friends he never credited for one moment the plea of urgent business or grave news that of course was a very transparent excuse for depriving him of mademoiselle de lisles society on this her birthday-night horatia had overstepped all limits forcing herself upon this company to make him an open laughing-stock in the eyes of his subjects he could picture their merriment if he rose and left at her command  tied to his mothers apron-strings-that was what they would say and caroline-how she would despise him should he fail to defend her from the queens spite he rose and addressed his mother in an angry tone knowing instinctively that the wine gave him artificial courage i must decline to be disturbed he said grandly and i am surprised at this uncalled-for intrusion unless you apologize to my hostess for your abusive language i will know the reason why i am king and as such i command you to retire and to seek some way by which you can wipe out this offense against good taste an insult to mademoiselle de lisle is an insult to the throne the words were received by shouts of bravo   bursting from the guests in unexpected unison instantly they took the cue from the king and turned in uproarious disapproval upon the haughty figure of the royal peace-breaker some disrespectful utterances were hurled in horatias direction and as she caught the evil mutterings her blood rose and her brain grew dizzy with its weight of passion god help you gisdel she cried if you stand by that woman and let me go alone you are lost forever-you have courted your own downfall i give up the game i leave you to your fate i your mother must hand you over to these devils who hold you in their clutches you think you are surrounded with friends poor duped fool you do not see the gates of hell closing upon you caroline winced at the words and stretching out protesting hands swayed as if about to fall but the action was merely the subtle movement of a dancer who could make her pliable body respond at will to her theatrical desires gisdel put his arm about her believing that by its support she was snatched from the borderland of insensibility then she spoke and her marvelous voice clear melodious intense startled the queen into a fresh realization of the actresss magnetic power we are devils she cried her eyes sweeping the long table with a look that appeared to comprise individually each man and woman present the queen has said it and the queen can not lie perhaps that is why she has joined us this evening it is a suitable abode for one whose red crimes are the talk of europe and the scandal of our land the terrible words turned gisdel cold suddenly he feared for his mother his arms fell to his side as he flashed a look of anger at the woman who dared to throw down the gauntlet in return and openly revile a royal personage in his presence horatia saw the swift change but the hostess fired by much wine and intoxicated by success had overstepped the mark and did not mean to spare her enemy yes continued caroline and if my love for our king has caused his mother pangs of jealous pain it is as nothing to the untold agonies she has inflicted for years upon suffering humanity the speaker hurled the words at horatia and leaving her throne-like chair stood at the comer of the table within an inch of the queen-mother as gisdel watched these women face to face a horrible fear possessed him wildly he asked his conscience how the evening would end-the evening of revelry which he had planned with so much pleasure he longed to move between them and lead his mother away but terror rooted him to the spot he could not even speak his tongue felt paralyzed and his lips were stiff and dry can a man be true have you anything more to say asked the queen drawing her skirts aside as if the nearness of the dancer defiled her royal garments  it is strange that a lowborn gutter virago like yourself should be so intimately acquainted with the life history of one whose private affairs can not possibly have reached your ears i hope these vile slanders will go far to show the king what he gains by honoring his inferiors and joining their drunken revels no words of mine will be needed now to prove to him what you are you have revealed your true self-you who trap the simple ones with your wiles and prey upon them like a human vampire i saw the brazen embrace you gave him as i entered this atmosphere of vice the kiss was uninvited by which you sullied the royal forehead you who talk of crimes to me seek to wreck the kings manhood with your fair speech you induced him to join this low company who flatter openly and in secret seek to destroy their sovereign you caroline de lisle snared my son you lured him to this house of ruin and he went after you like an ox to the slaughter let my final words sink deep into your heart for they are bible words and fit your case  she hath cast down many wounded yea many strong men have been slain by her her house is the way to hell going down to the chambers of death this last loudly uttered insult reached the far corners of the room and the stinging words went home with cruel intensity maddening the woman exposed to the calumny of the indignant queen a wild shrill laugh an insane laugh of uncontrollable rage broke from caroline your final words she shrieked beside herself with passion to sink deeply into my heart i give you in return o queen something to sink into your heart-something equally bitter with quick agile hand mademoiselle de lisle snatched a knife from the table and plunged it to the hilt in horatias breast chapter xxxiii maldio lives with a groan of agony the queens heavy form sank to the ground caroline staggered back as if for the moment she hardly realized her deed the startled assembly leaped to their feet and crowded round the fallen figure with varying expressions of loathing and disgust gisdel pushed his way to his mothers side wading in her blood he bent down and raised her head two faint words came from her gasping lips words he believed to be an illusion of the dying brain maldio lives as if by some strange witchcraft that last whispered acknowledgment came echoing through the open windows from the street below the town criers were shouting exultantly the news which once rumored spread like wildfire through the capital king maldio rescucd from the tomb king maldio to return the royal vault empty king maldio yet lives the sight of the dead queen and the cries of an excited mob in the thoroughfare which an hour since had been empty and deserted fired the revolutionary spirit of carolines assembled guests the assassination and the red vision of horatias blood appeared to intoxicate them more violently than the recent champagne and cognac which flowed like water the flushed faces grew vicious and menacing as they gathered round the dancers royal victim and a low hissing sound burst from a chorus of lips a tallwarlike singer from the opera with massive chest and bull-like neck kicked the body with an oath spitting on the blood-stained garments he was a strong believer in the queens treachery to her stepson and dared not hope the amazing cries from the street could hold a grain of truth in his loud resonant voice he addressed the multitude revenge the murder of maldio he cried death to king gisdel her partner in crime as the words broke on gisdels ears his very lips grew blue letting the queens head fall violently to the ground he sprang from his kneeling position and took refuge behind caroline hearing the shout of approbation which greeted the murderous suggestion in a moment those who had hailed him friend were thirsting for his blood his chattering teeth and cowering attitude as he clung for protection to mademoiselle de lisles skirts filled their dazed minds with contempt and loathing save me caroline-save me he whispered so softly that she alone could hear the plea quickly she looked from the livid face of  adventure the queens corpse to the sullen glowering eyes of her guests she knew only too well the fury in their hearts the fierce hatred they bore the dead woman and the pitiless scorn in which they held her worthless son one thing at a time replied mademoiselle de llsle in her wonderful voice which vibrated now with passionate emotion remove this vile woman who insulted me hurl her body into the courtyard it shall not contaminate these walls she pointed to a distant window opening to a balcony the men advancing upon the king were quick to obey her command in a moment they crowded round horatia roughly raising the body and bearing it away down the long room followed by a throng of women who moved unsteadily crowding to the window they pressed forward to see this further outrage to the dead queen your chance whispered caroline edging gisdel to a small side door hung with heavy strings of beads  hide in the hall cupboard behind the coats-you know where i mean quick-they are mad for blood gisdel knew the door well it was papered over and flush with the wall he took one wild terrified glance at the backs of his enemies hearing horatia fall with a thud upon the stone path below then sick and half stunned he flew for his life creeping behind a long sable cloak of carolines in the far corner of the dark recess shaking with fear he sank to the ground in a huddled heap giving himself up for lost he could hear his would-be assassins now maddened by drink and the lust of blood rushing from room to room to find the missing king caroline unable to control this first outbreak of revolution roused into action by her deed gave ready permission for the house to be searched sure in her heart they would not discover king gisdels hiding-place afraid to thwart their wild desires she joined in the man-hunt pretending to lend her aid he must be near she declared hotly the hall door is bolted so he can not have really escaped he slipped away when you were obeying my commands he probably ran up-stairs i was looking at the balcony -i should have guarded him better it was clear the intoxicated crew intended searching every nook and corner they peered into recesses opened cupboards crept beneath sofas and behind curtains as each effort proved unavailing they grew exasperated some ransacked the salon shaking out the delicate draperies lest they conceal the shivering king others mounted to the rose-colored bedchambers dress-closets and bathrooms even the box-room was fully investigated and the large trunks opened at last the disappointed seekers turned on caroline in sudden suspicion you are untrue to the cause cried the accusing voice of the operatic hercules you have enabled your lover to escape you intentionally withheld from us the honor of killing a traitor who sought to ruin the country maldio loved gisdel like his mother plotted for the crown alive or dead maldio was their victim caroline shook her head have i not with my own hand stabbed the queen to the heart she answered reproachfully i-and i alone claim to be the savior of lambasa this night i have stamped out the crudest life which ever darkened a so-called civilized nation yet you say  caroline is untrue see- stretching out her stained fingers-i am red to the wrist in horatias blood i have dragged the name of gisdel through the mire you think i love him take these- and these-and these she tore from neck breast and arms the jewels the king had given her hurling them dramatically at the feet of her accusers a shade of shame passed over the face of the singer who had voiced the general opinion pardon great caroline he pleaded  but since you are so mighty can not your wit rise to discover where the king hides she pressed her fists to her brow then as if seized by a sudden thought answered quickly the cellars of course i had forgotten the cellars he has taken refuge there go search below and i will keep watch at the head of the stairs and call instantly should i hear him move above the whole company appeared dominated by carolines will she insisted they should all descend to the vault-like cellars where she knew they would grope about in semidarkness seeing the king in every shadow as the last obeyed her wish and vanished underground she turned with light step and flew to the secret door in the wall of the can a man be true  gaily papered hall touching the spring she let in a ray of light no sign of gisdel till she whispered softly follow me-dont speak wrap yourself in my sable cloak as gisdel obeyed she ripped a frill of chiffon from her skirt and flung it over his head swift as lightning she unbolted the door leading to the street the strange figure of the shivering monarch passed out- and now the dawn was breaking the queens carriage still stood at the door gisdel sprang into it gasping the word home to the amazed coachman who recognized the kings voice beneath his disguise the gold domes of the palace were tipped with rosy light as gisdel approached he pulled himself together sufficiently to give another order stop at the sentry-box he gasped the troops must be called out at once the queen has been murdered the carriage drew up promptly gisdel did not wait for the footman to pen the door in a moment he had sprung to the pavement then a strange sight greeted his bloodshot eyes the palace was surrounded by soldiers and the distant sound of firing reached his ear to his intense surprise bistoff rode up on a white charger and the king saw he was fully armed i regret that i have to place you under arrest your majesty he said  what does it mean  cried gisdel white to the lips has every one gone mad what does it mean i say  civil war answered the court physician with his most military air and few are found loyal to their king but you-you are on our side gasped the terrified youth no answered diarmid bistoff unhesitatingly i am on the side of maldio- the-thinker chapter xxxiv the old home loti and maldio had said their good-by to red tower since the king could no longer blind his eyes to the call of duty it became increasingly urgent for him to return to his country and restore peace count bistoffs letters and telegrams implored him to delay no longer for the hour was drawing near when the nation must learn that their beloved thinker still lived to serve lambasa given back from the tomb as if by a miracle when the fateful hour came to make a final decision and to answer bistoffs entreaty by an arranged code maldio looked long and searchingly into the tear-dimmed eyes of his girl-wife loti he said when i see your sorrowful face and feel the force of my love for you i am almost tempted to disappoint my deliverer and write to bistoff that i will never set foot in lambasa again sometimes i feel it would be better to remain dead and buried to all my subjects and put aside the vainglory of a throne for peace for love and quiet living the temptation is strong-it comes upon me in weak moments when i feel your arms about my neck lotis heart stopped beating and in that brief second of breathless joy she saw him given forever into her keeping divorced from the burden of royalty-no longer a king but merely the man and the husband the one being who made the world for her a paradise of love then horrified by the overwhelming flood of selfish desire she stamped out that wild human longing calling into power the brave spirit which ruled her true being she knew she had everything to lose yet her higher nature warned her that if she failed to spur him to action the coming years would be ever darkened by shadows of regret now her eyes were no longer dim in the moment of victory they met his questioning gaze with the light of undaunted courage if i were to hold you back she whispered the day of remorse would follow i should be ashamed to look my king in the face knowing i had dragged him down feeling he must regard me as the evil genius of his youth you would not be the maldio i trusted and adored if you failed to fulfil the call of a great destiny though the parting is bitter-the very thought of it seems to me as a living death-i am ready for the blow i shall wait-like the wife of a soldier with my heart in the fray i shall be ready to join you in any capacity the moment you bid me come i only pray that as soon as it is possible you will let me be near you even though our love must take the form of a secret intrigue i would  adventure come as a servant in your palace sooner than live away from you in luxury her spirited words put fresh heart into her bridegroom and from that moment he shook off his rising depression and warmed to the task before him loti felt impressed by the businesslike manner in which the preparations for departure were made maldios methods were those of speed and despatch the very smallest detail in regard to giving up red tower he personally supervised while all financial arrangements for her comfort and the support of her father were put into the hands of an able lawyer of irreproachable reputation of course i shall go back to cambridge and do what i can to cheer my father she said i suppose i had better tell him who mr kingsley really is it will be a great shock of course but i could not stand the strain of parrying questions and keeping up the fiction that my husband was some stranger unknown to him of course the world will soon ring with the wonderful story of your return and father must know first with his horror of morganatic marriages i fear i shall have a difficult task in trying to reconcile him to the inevitable to make it easier for loti maldio went straight to his desk and wrote a long affectionate letter to the professor in which he swore to remain true to his english bride until the hour of death he begged forgiveness for the deception played upon one who as a parent had every right to share their confidence fully explaining the very exceptional circumstances he begged lotis father to regard this strange situation as sufficient excuse and warned the old man that his daughters return was but temporary as he should make arrangements for her to live in lambasa directly he was sure of his crown the good-by in a london station seemed to the bride like some weird dream her brain could hardly grasp the fact that maldio was returning to his high position to her he was just the love of her youth the simple light-hearted boyish companion of a blissful honeymoon those days at yew-ton now appeared strangely distant and vision-like-with one dark blot the awful night of a cruel bogus arrest despite her inward agony she determined to show a smiling face to the last maldio should remember her as never anything but stanch brave unfaltering as he took her in his arms in the reserved compartment and pressed a last long kiss upon lips which quivered against her will he whispered words of courage and the sure hope of future reunion loti clung to him her face pale her heart steadfast in its resolve not to break down shall i come with you as far as the boat she whispered a wild longing to put off the evil hour of parting prompting this sudden desire he shook his head no darling i could not endure the thought of your traveling back alone-it would make it harder for me you have good time now to catch your train to cambridge you will feel happier in familiar surroundings the old home will help you to bear up the doors of the train were already being closed and maldio watched the trembling figure alight wonderfully handsome he looked as he leaned through the open window for a last clasp of the dear hand a last word a last passionate meeting of languishing eyes good-by my heart my wife my queen he murmured as the engines shrill whistle sounded the dread moment of departure loti tried to answer but she could not speak for the choking sensation in her throat as maldio vanished from view loti moved away blinded by a rush of long-checked tears she felt glad his last words were-my queen they filled her with momentary comfort holding some vague significance for deep down in her heart lay the ever-unspoken dread and haunting specter-of a future queen v marthas excitement knew no bounds as she prepared for mrs - kingsley ample funds enabled her greatly to increase the comfort of college view inwardly the professor asked himself what this return meant fearfully contemplating the early absence of the bridegroom the mystery still held for him the taint of something underhand surely all these secret dealings must spell the future ruin of lotis happiness had she possibly been tricked into some marriage which was no marriage at all was she the tool of some can a man be true  wealthy and unscrupulous deceiver these questions were still uppermost in his mind as he waited on the platform to meet his daughter so engrossed wtas he with these nervous speculations that the train came well into the station before he was aware of its approach a moment later loti beautifully dressed in an immaculate traveling costume and fashionable hat sprang out with all her old childish energy and flung her arms round his neck father she cried father the feel of her wtarm cheek the sight of her young beauty wrarmed him like a sudden burst of sunshine yes she was the same loti who had vanished away so suddenly from the quiet little home and a great wave of startling pleasure swept through the dazed mind of the troubled man every one had a smile and a word of welcome for the bride and many were the hats raised in cheerful acknowledgment of her presence as she drove through the familiar streets as if by mutual consent both father and daughter avoided the subject of the wadding speaking only of commonplace matters martha beaming and excited waited at the door of college view how small it looked how pitifully small compared to red tower it seemed to have shrunk to minute proportions during lotis absence the professor fumbled for the fare ill pay she said opening a gold chain-bag which hung from her wrist inside lay some loose silver against the letter to his father-in-law written by king maldio of lambasa chapter xxxv confession f i he professor drew a chair forward as if loti were a stranger and begged her to be seated you must be tired after your journey he said in a formal voice the girls quick eyes noted the many additions supplied by thoughtful hands in response to a written command from red tower that no expense should be spared in making the professor comfortable the shabby room appeared quite luxurious now with its spotless new curtains and recovered furniture as loti poured out her fathers tea she wondered when he would speak of her marriage he took the cup from her with a murmured thank you and added in the dreamy voice she knew so wrell are you happy little girl why did you shut me out why did you try to break my heart the low halting words revealed all the deep suffering inflicted by her silence in a moment she was on her knees at his feet holding both his hands in her warm clasp and gazing with all her soul into the tired drawn face of the aged man oh father she whispered how cruel you must have thought me but indeed i longed to tell you all when you hear my story you will understand the grave issues and the many difficulties did you really think i left you for a stranger you had never seen did you believe it possible i could so soon forget maldio the professor shivered had she taken leave of her senses i hope you will not talk of maldio do not dwell upon an old and impossible love-affair naturally i feel terribly anxious about your future it looks as if your bridegroom were in some way ashamed of us that he has not returned with you here if he is under the impression you are not as well born as himself let him come to me -let him come to me the old man repeated the words with unexpected fervor a weird almost vindictive light leaped into the usually mild eyes would to god i were his equal in birth said loti and her breath came quickly the magnus family can boast a long line of ancestors but that is not enough you have always spoken in horror of royal blood father as if by some uncanny instinct you knew your daughter would one day become the morgantic wife of a king professor magnus started violently and his face grew ashen i-i cant grasp what you mean child the wife of a king how could that be the only royal person you ever knew died in lambasa some time before your wedding with mr kingsley loti put her arms round the agitated figure and in quick impressive tones poured forth her wonderful story the letter written unmistakably by maldio was eagerly spread out before the professors  adventure astonished gaze in wondering silence he read the eloquent message sent to reassure him the written promise that no other woman should ever share the life given back from the tomb for a while the old man appeared too overcome for speech as he caught loti to his breast and held her there strained to his heart she knew at least he forgave however deeply he suffered at last his voice returned very feebly he murmured  has king maldio actually sailed is it not possible i could have a word with him before he goes loti shook her head he is on the sea now she answered he could not delay can you write to the king asked her father eagerly  i wish to send him a letter at once his attitude was one of tension as leaning forward he put the short sharp question his voice was no longer dreamy or absent-minded it seemed as if his faculties were almost painfully roused loti had never seen him so alert or keenly interested in any subject unconnected with science oh yes she answered quickly we can write to him under cover of count bistoffs name i know it will be a great relief to maldio if you send him a kind word the professor sat with his hands clasped tightly together now he seemed far away again and loti knew instinctively he had forgotten her presence his lips were moving-he was muttering to himself words she tried to catch without avail father said loti tapping him on the shoulder tell me your thoughts dont you feel well he caught the note of fear in her voice i was thinking he said of the long ago i forgot you were there my child i was living again in the old days before you were born contemplating the long arm of coincidence-the strange twisted paths of what men call fate i am trying to accustom myself to these startling truths my loti is allied to royal blood the royal blood that in my eyes spells the ruin of happiness but it is her own doing-she has chosen her destiny god grant that by a miracle she may be saved from misery as sure as i am speaking to you now lambasa will claim a queen and maldio will be forced to seek a partner for his throne the old man rose no sympathy rang in his voice as he spoke the cruel prophecy instead a look of triumph glowed in his eyes where are you going father asked loti as he moved to the door to my room i must be alone dont follow me i must be alone puzzled by the strangeness of his manner loti dared not follow instead of going to his room the professor mounted slowly to a loft at the top of the house he paused on the threshold and stood staring at trunks and lumber as if uncertain which way to turn then with a little cry he fell upon a long iron case and drew a bunch of keys from his pocket chapter xxxvi a letter to king maldio through the narrow window of the loft the setting sun sent faint gold rays to shine upon the professors bent figure the kindly light made a halo round the silver head and pierced the dark recesses of the mysterious iron box to loti it was familiar only from the outside for she had never been allowed to open the lid on which the word private had been pasted long ago both martha and her young mistress knew well the dusty iron case was precious in the eyes of its owner once when a small fire broke out on the ground floor of college view before he gave a thought to his own safety the professor had hurried to the loft to make sure of rescuing the box which held his most valued papers now his eyes sought eagerly for a faded pile of legal-looking documents fastened together with sealed tape as he drew them forth he bit his lips and stifled a sigh that was almost a sob for a moment he held them up and read the words clearly written on the outside of the paper yellow now with age to be destroyed at my death unless ere i breathe my last i change my present opinion and with my own lips tell loti to read the contents always the fear he muttered always the fear that in the end i would make it known god help me if i am acting wrongly he broke the tape and scattered the secret papers on the floor sorting them can a man be true  with care and scanning each in turn with an expression of sorrowful disgust poor loti he murmured poor injured child of destiny how you must suffer in the future god help you to bear your fate with the look of a martyr going to the stake the professor holding the papers to his heart slowly left the shadowy room which had given up its strange treasure from the old iron box the stealthy feet made no sound as they descended the stairs and entered the comfortable bedchamber with its wealth of roses clambering round the casement at the open window with knitted brow and set lips he wrote with the neatness of a copy-book his letter to king maldio it was a long and intensely interesting epistle more than once before its conclusion the professor rose and paced the room when eventually he signed his name with a fantastic flourish he was shaking from head to foot as if seized by a fit of ague sealing the important document with his signet ring he rang for martha she came quickly in answer to the summons  send miss loti to me at once martha paused hoping he would make some further remark but he kept his eyes on the blotting-paper a little disappointed she hurried away with the message as loti came in with the light step of girlhood the professor realized that as yet she could not grasp the appalling position in which she was placed i want to address this envelope to the king of lambasa he said i suppose it must go to him through count bistoff please tell me exactly what to write i shall send it registered by to-nights post loti looked doubtfully at the bulky package i am enclosing a few papers of interest replied the old man and his voice sounded far away while his mystic eyes gazed suddenly into space if he likes to throw them aside he must do so and i think he will be the loser of course he would read anything you were kind enough to send declared loti  i suppose-i may not see the letter  professor magnus pointed to the seal no he replied in a voice of resolute determination inwardly he added to himself you shut me out of your confidence this is retaliation besides it is better for you not to know let maldio act as he sees fit let maldio be the judge you-you have not said anything unkind to maldio she whispered pressing her soft cheek against her fathers wrinkled face i cant imagine myself angry or vindictive towards him even if he treated me cruelly and that i know is impossible he does so want to make me happy the professor avoided lotis eyes whatever occurs in the future he said if you appeared happier than any woman living i should still shudder to think you had condescended to become a morganatic wife how would you feel if a royal wedding were announced late in life perhaps and you were forced to stand aside like a woman who has loved without the right to claim a husbands protection he did not put the question harshly it seemed rather that he spoke his fears aloud -that his hatred of thrones prompted the awful fancy loti soothed him with cheering words maldio would be true-maldio was so different from other men he had tasted death he was like gold tried by the fire they need have no fear with bent head drooping shoulders and unconvinced heart the professor walked slowly to the post-office he would entrust the guarded missive to no hand but his own and his air was even more preoccupied than usual as he passed close to intimate friends without acknowledging their salutations when he returned professor magnus usually so careless with articles of value or money locked away the registration-slip which chronicled the sending of that large bulky envelope to lambasa though loti tried throughout the evening to draw from him some hint of the letters contents she found him absolutely secretive on the subject that night when she retired to the little white room of her girlhood she realized the true meaning of the word loneliness though golden memories crowded her brain the absence of her bridegroom filled her heart with restless sorrow her feverish longing for a sight of his face for the sound of his voice became almost unbearable and eventually salt tears washed her into a realm of heavy slumber  adventure chapter xxxvii all in good time as every moment tookmaldio farther away from england the old ties of home seemed calling more forcibly and binding about his heart the cords of duty though his love for loti was strong he knew that before her happiness or his own he must consider the welfare of his country already those former schemes by which he had sought to save the nation from the merciless methods of the past were growing and expanding in his brain he was truly  maldio the thinker as he sat watching the restless movement of the sea while he wove fresh ideas for the well-being of his people now and again he almost fancied his wife stood at his side murmuring wrords of approval she knew all the ambitions of his heart he could rely on her sympathy and trust to her silence his deeply meditative manner prevented those who strolled by from disturbing his reverie though many curious eyes sought that silent figure with puzzled expressions and questioning thoughts they knew the face instinctively for at the time of mal-dios death his portrait had appeared in various papers throughout europe the natives of lambasa are strangely alike remarked an especially interested observer that young man bears a strong resemblance to the late king he may be related to the royal house traveling incognito i would not care to go to his country now for some bad rioting is expected and it looks as if queen horatia may be forced to retire into exile at any moment serve her right came the quick answer if all the scandal about her is true the sooner she is hounded out the better for everybody the boat was nearing the quay and a sudden search for rugs and bags prevented further conversation the friends who had discussed maldio followed just behind him as the passengers walked single file across the gangway a crowd of newspaper boys accosted the arrivals as they emerged from the great steamer shouting in piercing accents assassination of queen horatia stabbed to death by a dancer tragedy of the kings supper-party revolutionary meth- ods adopted king gisdel imprisoned rumors of king maldios return from the tomb amazing treachery at court journals were eagerly purchased and the situation in lambasa dicussed on all sides the two friends wratched maldio as he snatched a copy from the grimy hands of a yelling street arab and bent to scan the words did you see how white that young fellow turned they remarked exchanging glances as soon as maldio could escape from the rush at the custom-house he hurried to a reserved seat in the express and devoured the contents of a pile of papers graphically the scene of gisdels supper at the residence of mademoiselle de llsle wtas described-the throwing of horatias body from the window and the fortunate escape of the king wtho would otherwise have shared his mothers death at the time of going to press the revolutionaries doubtless for purposes of their own have spread abroad a wild report that maldio the thinker is yet alive the coffin in which he was undoubtedly buried has been tampered with and is now lying empty in the chancel of the cathedral diarmid bistofi the court physician has sworn that he himself rescued the young monarch alive on the eve of his burial and has revealed a secret passage from the vault to his residence the villa monastero the people are mad with joy at the possibility of finding the rumor true though it will never be fully credited until maldio himself reappears to quiet the kingdom and remount his throne as the king read the words eagerly he heard a telegraph boy calling his name- kingsley hailing him maldio opened a message even before he learned its import he caught the signature bistoff meeting you at frontier with large military escort victorious party warmly desire your return and trust your majesty will give the royal consent to a new scheme of government the joy of the inhabitants at the news of your continued existence is indescribable your brother desires to abdicate but is to be kept prisoner until your wishes are known dugdale has testified to the late queens treachery and all her confidential guards and ministers are under arrest as the train started with a shrill whistle and sped through the summer land stretching to the frontier of his kingdom maldios thoughts were plunged in a new channel the news of queen horatias violent death turned him sick full well he knew she de- can a man be true  served her fate yet he shuddered as he pictured her guilty fears when the truth dawned upon her that retribution was at hand poor gisdel he said how she made him suffer through her very love and ambition for a favored son at least he was innocent of plotting my death-bistoff knows that-and i shall certainly force him to clear my step-brothers character  the hours seemed long and tedious before the frontier was reached then a startling surprise awaited the travelers by the world-renowned express suddenly heads were thrust from the windows of every compartment and eyes gazed curiously at the red-carpeted platform lined with soldiers and decorated with palms and flags a gray-haired man in uniform none other than the now famous count bistoff advanced to the saloon carriage from which a boy-like figure sprang with outstretched hands king maldio greeted the loyal subject to whom he owed his life after a few brief words of welcome bistoff informed him that a dressing-room had been prepared in which the travel-stained monarch could change from civilian garb into the resplendent uniform of the kings own regiment i felt sure your majesty would wish to be so attired for your triumphal entry into the capital said bistoff who himself guarded a case of priceless orders in which lay the great diamond star that had been buried with maldios supposed corpse  the town is being decked as if for a royal wedding even when your majesty selects a queen there will not be such rejoicing as now the battle-cry has been suddenly silenced it is the cry of life now-long live king maldio the mention of a new queen the wife of the reinstated king sent a momentary shadow over maldios face there will be no royal wedding he answered looking diarmid fully in the eyes already i am bound for life to a morganatic bride bistoff started and bit his lip with sudden vexation then restraining his disappointment he murmured softly  the kings will be done but it is not in the blood of maldio the thinker to neglect his duty to the throne to the state to heaven itself all in good time your most gracious majesty all in good time the words sank like lead into maldios heart loti-his loti-seemed like the dream-inhabitant of another world far so far away chapter xxxviii a royal prisoner many and deep were the emotions of the reinstated king as he made his triumphal entry into the capital never had a human crowd cheered any living man as this mortal from the tomb their shouts of joy were almost as the roar of thunder reaching the listening ears of gisdel imprisoned in the palace and guarded by soldiers once his own subjects in moody silence he sat picturing the scene he had heard something from a talkative servant who appeared to take a certain cruel delight in supplying the eagerly-asked-for information gisdel drank in every word with feverish dread he dared not think of his own punishment should those in power refuse to believe he was unacquainted with his mothers hideous deeds what if he should have to suffer for her crimes the terrifying verdict of carolines supper guests still rang in his ears-death to king gisdel he knew well the romantic temperament of lambasas populace how they would worship the king whom they had followed weeping to the grave hearts must beat wildly that day with uncontrollable joy and eyes be dimmed by tears of unspeakable gladness maldios return had checked the outbreak of revolution putting an end to civil war through the length and breadth of the land a great wave of loyalty spread upon wings of rejoicing while every country learning the news would marvel at the wonderful fortune and thrilling romance of this amazing resurrection gisdel remembering the stiff form in the coffin shuddered to think he must face his brother again he knew maldio would have followed the career of failure which alone marked the history of king gisdels short reign he saw now to the full his own limitations laying them at the door of his dead mother she was responsible and she alone for the weakness of his policy for his lack of understanding she had kept him at her side like a baby training him to selfish ease any width of view or  adventure effort at advancement met with her instant disapproval and speedy check gisdel was to be always under her thumb the tool of her will the child forced to obey her desires however cruel vain and meaningless as he passed lonely hours of contemplation he looked deeply into his heart examining the weak spots in his nature marking without pity each lamentable error from early childhood to the present hour he wondered if he would ever have a chance as a man and not as a prince or reigning monarch to redeem those years mademoiselle de lisle in that moment of brutal assault upon the queen had taught him an unforgettable lesson he saw still in his dreams the woman he had loved striking that deadly blow which had changed his blind infatuation to cold horror a feverish desire for freedom possessed the restless prisoner though he was permitted the comforts due his rank the very idea of incarceration maddened him if only he could get away and forever shake the dust of lambasa from his feet when night fell he grew still more depressed and hearing a strange booming sound asked nervously what it might mean those are the salutes being let off in honor of his majesty king maldio replied the servant who waited upon prince gisdel at dinner the city is en fete the prisoner made no remark he felt he could not bear to hear of the nations rejoicing at his fall and maldios return leaving his food untasted gisdel moved to a sofa and flinging himself down closed the eyes that ached from sleepless nights and fruitless vigils just as he vaguely wondered whether by any painless process he could put an end to this weary existence he heard the tramping of feet outside on the polished floor of the wtide passage he sprang up suddenly paralyzed with fear possibly the soldiers were coming to remove him from these passably comfortable quarters to some prison cell perhaps the country had demanded his death and he was to be led out and shot under cover of the night a thousand dread alarms seized his brain and like a child afraid of the dark he cowered away in the far corner of the room covering his face with his hands the sentry outside moved away to enable the new-comers to unbolt the door a flash of light from the brilliantly illuminated passage streamed in gisdel pulling himself together with a sudden sense of shame at his own cowardice stepped forward unsteadily as he did so the door closed again and he found himself face to face and alone with the brother wiio had been lowered before his very eyes into the cathedral vault-the brother queen horatia sought to destroy that gisdel might reign just for a moment the trembling prisoner turned cold with superstitious dread he asked himself whether maldio were really there or whether this were merely a trick of his over-excited and troubled mind the tall youthful figure in its handsome uniform advanced and took gisdel by the hand the firm friendly clasp suddenly fired the ex-kings frozen blood with a gasp of wonder he stammered a halting question maldio is it really you  no mistaking the warm human touch there was nothing ghostly in maldios smile so sweetly forgiving and full of unspoken encouragement my poor gisdel he said drawing his stepbrother nearer the kindly tone and conciliatory manner affected gisdel more deeply than all the harshness he had recently endured falling forward into maldios arms his vitality ebbed away in the throes of an emotional faint maldio picked up the puny form and laid it on the sofa i will not summon help he said  gisdel is despised enough already he tried to master his sense of contemptuous scorn telling himself that the son horatia loved was as much her victim as was the stepson she hated at last gisdel opened ms eyes let me abdicate he murmured it is all i ask in pity give me my freedom- say that i may go to some land of peace i require no princely state no hampering title i never wanted to be king now i do not even want to be a prince maldio raised the limp figure before either he said a trifle sternly you must learn to be a man to be concluded he that prepareth the way radoslav atsanoff he apostle was what the people were calling father boyan the comitaji who had abandoned his little church and his fat deaconry in vodena to muddle the swineherds and charcoalmen with his notions of human rights and freedom a gospel of fire and sword he was preaching throughout macedonia and he had so far managed to eel his way through all the nets of the turkish police the standing reward of iooo pounds offered by the sublime porte for his head had been accumulating interest at the ottoman bank for the past twenty-five months the rascal was well-nigh ubiquitous every one knew of him but somehow or other nobody seemed to know him but news does leak out in spite of the best precautions somebody had blabbed and enver pasha of tetino had it on reliable information that the macedono-adrian-opolitan revolutionary committee was planning a winter congress to be held some time in january for the purpose of deciding upon the advisability of an early spring uprising how it reached the ears of the police no one perhaps will ever know definitely but enver pashas entire machinery of sentries and spies was set in motion and the thousand-fingered hand of the ottoman police reached out ravenously for the master organizer who was said to be preparing to begin the canvass of the tetino district rumors had it even that he was hiding in the city that identical third week of november late sunday night november th enver pashas chief assistant selim ef-fendi otherwise known in tetino as the tipsy bloodhound saw a suspicious-looking peasant attempting to cross the cordon of police that girdled the city with the assistance of his zaptieh osman selim effendi overpowered the peasant tied and gagged him a search of his clothes made selim the possessor of the following message hand-printed in good bulgarian to robespierre in poliany-from the den of lions greeting he that prepareth the way will gurgle over a cup of coffee in stankos inn in livady village on tuesday afternoon next to meet you for obvious reasons with tidings from the great on high of a priests cassock and a flowing beard nor turk nor moslem ever is afeared to selim effendi the meaning was plain what conceited idiot in poliany had assumed the revolutionary pseudonym of robespierre selim knew little and cared  j  adventure less he that prepareth the way however could refer to but one person and if i could intercept his way the effendi thought i would be richer by exactly  pounds and who knows but that enver pashas own boots might be none too big for me the arrangements for the rendezvous were precision itself stankos inn livady tuesday afternoon the apostles disguise being a priests cassock and a flowing beard so much was plain another thing equally plain was that tetino did actually hold the apostle selim effendi was thinking hard three courses were open to him he might apprise enver pasha of his find-and be sent at once on a special mission to salonica while the pasha turned tetino upside dowrn captured the apostle and kept the  pounds or he might try to catch the apostle himself on his way to dobridol but this was uncertain and would also involve the cooperation of more allies than selim effendi cared to share the money writh or else he that prepareth the way could be trusted to see his way clear to livady and then find in stankos inn a trap waiting for him in the form say of a dealer in ikons or else a merchant or an american missionary the choice was a minor matter to selims mind there was no question about the relative merits of the three courses in order to follow the third course however it was necessary that the identity of robespierre should be established and the letter forwarded to its destination without exciting any suspicion the captured peasant was stolidly stubborn during the first fifteen minutes of selim effendis argumentation down in the cellar of the tetino jail but the tipsy bloodhound was a past master in the art of exquisite torture and by the time the third beech-splinter had been hammered under the finger-nails of the captives left hand his right hand had traced upon a blood-stained scrap of paper the name of the poliany schoolmaster having copied the letter selim carefully resealed it and putting it into another envelope directed it to the onbashi at poliany with instructions that it be left secretly on dascal zoeffs desk in the schoolhouse and that the onbashi make certain of it that zoeff got it also that zoeff be not interfered with in any wtay for the length of a week  much rather would i have you go with it osman he turned to his zaptieh but if you were missing to-morrow id have to answer questions and i care little what happens tuesday once we get to livady for wre shall meet our man-you can trust apostle boyan to make his way through the tetino sen try-watches then he turned to the peasant there are some christian curs that give the wrong name but after the beech-splinter i always try the hot olive oil and there is quicksilver a-plenty to dance up and down your ear-drums and burning charcoal to make your soles sizzle this cellar i lock and i unlock do you hear you giaour in a couple of days ill know whether you have been lying to me or not then you may learn to know some things that your mother never taught you  monday passed as usual but on tuesday morning enver pasha did not see selim effendi kick the konak gates open as was his custom with osman managing to rush in after him just in time to escape being hit by the gate as it slammed to off on a spree again like as not drunk as a seaman enver pasha remarked and thought little about it ii livady is a village at the foot of the payak mountains about five hours ride on muleback from tetino the road from the city zigzags along the bank of the vardar river which here spreads its bed lazily and sprawls over the entire valley making the country a rich rice-growing region but also one abounding in boggy swamps and treacherous morasses its close proximity to the payak mountains made the village a favorite rendezvous of insurgents who found the mountain crags as hospitable as the fens of the vardar in offering hiding-holes to the enemies of islam but there was no branch organization of the revolutionary committee in livady maybe the primitive life of the natives and their low level of intelligence could account for the fact their humble poverty and their superstitious character made hard any attempt to instill new ideas or inspire a spirit of opposition to the established order they were mostly charcoalmen their skinny mules grunting under huge loads of charred timber formed an integral part he that prepareth the way  of the tetino landscape on market-days mules and bullocks were the only automobiles to be had in livady there was scarcely one horse in the whole village the mountainside was dotted with smoking charcoal-hills that looked at night like a hundred monstrous slumbering fireflies charred as it were for ages all physiognomies had gloomed from tanned youth one graduated to tawny manhood before attaining to that midnight ebony that marked the neck of the charcoal patriarch a foggy glum sullen day it was the city merchant wrapped in furs with a shawl around his ears in regular tetino fashion nodded sociably at each peasant he met pacing the muddy road beside his mule and cursing the weather by all the saints in the greek calendar stopped his horse every little while to chat with some of the char-coalmen that looked more intelligent the unsuspecting way in which the peasants answered his inquiries about livady and recent church doings in the village assured selim effendi of the complete success of his disguise his man osman also on horseback played his part of zaptieh-servant irreproachably another half-hours ride brought the two men to the main street of livady in front of the village livery-stable and within shouting distance of stankos inn selim effendi dismounted now osman he turned to the zaptieh here is your chance if we catch that rascal youll be an iuzbashi in a week with enough gold jingling in your pockets to make anybody dance to your music three elbow-lengths tall osman and as for girth neither a grasshopper nor a hog gray eyes dark hair had french tailored clothes when last seen in salonica the time when he fooled azni pashas entire police force but no one outside the revolutionary organization knows exactly how the apostle looks so keep your eyes open for a priests cassock and a flowing beard-those are his own words osman of a priests cassock and a flowing beard nor turk nor moslem ever is afeared ill be on the watch for him at the inn but you sort of look after the horses like a real zaptieh-servant and scan the face of each that passes down the street and then turning toward the cafe barber shop in stankos courtyard he yelled at the zaptieh in regular city-merchant style dont you let my horse starve either do you hear give him plenty of oats and have him ready to start back in a couple of hours i must be back in tetino by sundown and come over to stankos by-and-by i may need you wake up you flat-footed zany why are you staring at me like an ox at a painted door  stankos was not a pretentious cafe even for a village of livadys size a squarish box of brick and pine boards in front of the inn proper it might have reminded one of a gatemans lodge at a salonica palace one side was given over to stankos coffee-place and bar-counter combined and behind it was a door connecting with a sleep-ing-room for the innkeeper and his help the corner on the other side of stankos bar was occupied by the barber-shop end of the establishment an old armchair with the back sawed off and hinged to the seat the top part being attached to a rope which could be pulled and regulated by means of a pulley fastened to the wall served just as well as a salonica leather-covered hy-draulic-power contraption and if the mirror was fly-specked the razor at least was never dull and there was always lather enough on hand to shave a grizzly some sentimental chromos of french or italian descent pasted on the walls lent some color to the whitewashed interior and in one corner an ikon of st george killing the dragon added the finishing touch of art cigarette-box etiquettes were glued in rows over the smoking divan and on the low tabourets in front were earthen ash-trays boxes of matches and empty wine-bottles a mangal piled high with charcoal glowed in the center of the shop and its sparks were a welcome sight on such an afternoon stanko the innkeeper was tending his coffee-pot by the fire and greeted the fur-clad city merchant with the typical village cafejis bow st demeter bless your liver this afternoon traveler may you stay here long and like it your livady is colder than ice to-day selim grumbled by way of response  get me a hot brandy and some prespa wine i am three-quarters frozen stanko keeps no traveler waiting so help me st petka you shall have it all in a twinkle and the innkeeper stepped down through the trap-door to where he kept his liquors  adventure selim was no mohammedan teetotaler he gulped down his brandy with as much zest and as little water as any christian toper in all tetino and got drunk as often his desire to justify an irrepressible craving had taken the form of a sort of fixed idea that brandy cleared his brain when he wanted to be alert and snappy in his movements and this fixed idea persisted in spite of abundant proof of many a sad experience to the contrary so when stanko returned from his cellar selim effendi for a moment forgot the object of his journey to livady having shaken himself up a little bit the effendi looked about the place a younker evidently stankos apprentice in the ton-sorial art was lathering some ones face apparently dozing on the divan however his face turned toward the window was a priest in a cassock the beard was flowing enough at the sound of selims voice the priest had sleepily turned toward him and half-opened his eyes then turned back and dropped into a doze again ill not in selim effendis most optimistic dreams had it occurred to him that he wtould stumble upon the apostle napping the moment he entered stankos precincts now the tipsy bloodhound was no fool and he knew that apostle boyan had equally little claim to membership in the category of idiots that a man wrho knew himself to be so fiercely hounded should be so reckless as to indulge in the luxury of a public nap was hard to explain on any other supposition than perhaps complete physical and mental exhaustion but was he really asleep for the one hasty glance the apparently dozing priest had given him before resuming his slumbers was far too keen and intelligent for a man just disturbed in his nap the entire situation flashed on selim the apostle wtas on the watch for his man from poliany and was simulating sleepiness in order to avoid unnecessary and undesirable conversations with other parties evidently he had full faith in the completeness of his incognito the turkish police might be on the lookout for him in tetino in places like dedov rid and poliany wrhere comitajis were plenty but not in a char-coal-hole like livady you ubiquitous rascal selim thought if you only knew that your messenger is starving in my cellar this minute and that a copy of your letter to robespierre is in my pocket he sat dowrn on the divan next to the priestly-clad figure and absorbing stankos intoxicants to thaw his blood beat his brains to hatch out some scheme of making sure of the apostle selim effendi had come to livady in the guise of an ikon-dealer the choice of this particular form of disguise had suggested itself by the disguise dictated by the apostle himself in his letter to the poliany schoolmaster for it seemed to him that an ikon-dealer had natural claims on the attention of a man in cassock and once he could get at his man without exciting suspicion he could trust his twelve-shot-straight revolver and the steel grip of osmans paw a plan was slowly assuming definite shape in his mind-a plan that appealed to selims sense of humor besides being safe and effective he had stanko move the mangal to the corner of the room nearer the barber shop where he could look into the street and seating himself a la urque on a cushion in front of it went on sipping at his brandy and looking out of the lowt grimy window then his eyes turned to the st george killing the dragon wrhich beautified the corner diagonally opposite innkeeper he asked who is that half-naked bully thats trying to tickle a lizard with his goad in your picture over there half-naked bully tickling a lizard good lord deliver us poor sinners stanko began crossing himself piously  be you a catholic or an unbeliever traveler that you dont recognize st george and the dragon st george of all saints sir oh it is st george killing the dragon eh well now innkeeper i meant no harm by my question but my eyes are giving out and i just couldnt tell what it stood for the st georges i sell to be sure are a different matter you can tell my st georges at a hundred paces so tis an ikon-pedler you be traveler stanko inquired an ikon-merchant right you have it my brother is the archdeacon of the st panteleimon monastery in the holy athos his hermits paint those ikons between midnight and sunrise and every blessed one is blessed with holy-water from the fountain he that prepareth the way  of st panteleimon under the altar i sell them but only to good christians to priests and deacons and pious innkeepers as i may chance to find one in a weeks journeying our ikons are sanctified and if an unbeliever or a rascal touches them wo betide the house where the holy ikon has been thus insulted why innkeeper my st georges are almost alive and the dragon spits real fire if you touch him during lent with greasy hands it would burn your lingers  virgin mary and holy st calliope have mercy on our souls and deliver us from fires everlasting stanko was a pious idiot and made use of a wide acquaintance with the celestial community in his exclamations you are a good christian innkeeper stanko is your name  stanko is my name traveler well here comes my zaptieh-servant now then you armenian tortoise where have you been lolling all this while didnt i tell you that there was a pious innkeeper here that wanted one of our real live st georges wtith the fire-spitting dragons hurry up and bring a couple of them over here and have him choose the one he likes best the reclining figure in the cassock hardly stirred during this speech of sclims yes stanko the effendi continued if you wish to find out whether a man is cheating you just get him to touch the dragons tongue with his third finger and watch it blister my ikons never lie fact is i cant sell you any no matter how much money you may offer for it until you have touched the dragon yourself while chanting the gospody pomiluy of the holy liturgy if it doesnt burn you you can have it free for nothing and without cost what the st george ikon why yes provided you do your share in an experiment i am going to try the door opened and osman walked in noisily with a package bulging out from under his coat selim noticed the napping priest suddenly turn around and shoot a glance at the new-comer and then continue his snoring stanko grinned at selim effendi and nodded toward the dozing figure a priests son is the devils grandson nowadays traveler god alone knows where he has been last night said he came from tetino where he had been visiting some sick parishioners and then he said he was going on a pilgrimage to the great on  high well i dont know about that-and far be it from me merchant to speak ill of a priest in cassock the virgin mary bless my sinful heart well thats what i was coming to stanko the effendi continued he relieved the servant of his package then beckoning to the innkeeper to sit down selim effendi moved his cushion closer to him and began whispering in his ear here is what i think stanko when i was at st panteleimons last time my brother archdeacon azarias told me look out wherever you go brother the evil one is abroad the evil one says i yes he answered  the very satan himself the lord has given him leave to travel all over macedonia in the garb of a priest and see whomsoever he can snare the lord wishes to find out how many of his servants can tell each other from the devil pretty hard thing to do with some of them brother thats what my brother the archdeacon told me by st onuphry and by st sophrony and have you seen him anywhere in your travels stanko was crossing himself and mumbling the gospody pomiluy shhhl selim effendi cautioned not so loud i asked my brother the archdeacon and how can i recognize him shall  try my dragon on him and blister his fingers  by no means says he the st georges are no good except for mortal men but i had a dream last night and my brother the archdeacon said i saw the holy parchment of st panteleimon curl up on the thirty-third page i opened the book first thing after liturgy and this is what i read by his beard shalt thou know him the evil one that keepeth awake in the night and sleepeth in the daytime with the owl by his beard and his cassock shalt thou know him thou shalt bind his feet and his eyes shalt thou put to confusion and his beard shalt thou pluck and cast away for a sleeping servant is unto the lord an abomination whatever that means brother my brother the archdeacon says  whatever that means i have not pondered yet well stanko the effendi continued you feel where the wind is blowing i have been watching him over there on the smoking-divan and if he doesnt answer the holy book of st panteleimon to an iota now innkeeper as you are a christian and an honest man help me capture  adventure the devil and the st george is yours for nothing holy st john of rylo traveler i must go and fix up some tilings in the inn-excuse me if you dont stanko-selim ignored his remark-if you dont help your inn will be accursed from this day forth and forever more for the devil damns every spot that he lays his head upon  good lord and virgin mary have mercy on our souls what do you want me to do kind brother of the archdeacon  talk about something else and get me some strong hempen rope and a dish of red pepper then when i try to bind him if he should put up a fight you just throw the red pepper in his eyes and my zaptieh will be on hand to give him all he wants and listen innkeeper-selim spoke aloud for effect-get me some cucumber pickles while you are about it in a second traveler the lord have mercy stanko answered a raucous voice from the barber chair scolded at the apprentice steady you green-haired little monkey steady what do you think you are about -plucking a rooster or sheep-shearing just dare scratch me and ill skin your hide for you and then as stanko returned innkeeper youve got to do it yourself i am not going to let that puppy scratch at my face another minute there there customer the innkeeper answered he is doing his best i cant shave you myself because my right thumb is sore ivan dont you cut the customer else ill pack you off to your father again  selim effendi barely glanced at the splenetic city man in the barber chair but the effendis eyes were fixed on the napping priest who was beginning to get restless it was not a mere matter of overpowering him that was easy enough with osman on hand but selim effendi wished to capture his man and get away without any ones being the wiser he had reasons for moving in the dark his very expedition to livady undertaken as it was without enver pashas knowledge was a plain breach of tetino police regulations which only a spectacular move-like walking in the konak first thing wednesday morning with the apostle tied and bound-could atone for moreover selim did not know the political leanings of his superstitious innkeeper or for that matter of the city man in the chair it was safer to make an ally of stanko in a holy war against the devil than risk having him as an enemy in a plot to catch the apostle once he had his man tied and helpless he could afford to assert his police authority before the napping man in cassock had had a chance to realize what was happening one quick blow on the part of osman had pinned him to the divan and while the innkeeper dashed a handful of red pepper into his face selim efftndi bound him hand and foot with his long rope at the cry of the prisoner the city man in the chair made a sudden jerk and the apprentice almost slashed off his ear ivan had overheard part of his masters conversation with the ikon-dealer which partly accounted for his nervousness for the lad was as superstitious as his master the city man did not interfere it would have done no good anyway he wras alone against a lot of religious fanatics or did he have reasons of his own for not caring to mix in in macedonia people often have reasons for minding their owm business now hurry up he snapped at the apprentice do you think i am going to camp in this chair tend to your shaving  na zdravie sir good-luck to you murmured ivan the apprentice as he wiped his customers neck with a hot towel i dont mean any harm sir but one gets nervous sometimes the shaved man tossed a piaster on the chair and turned toward the other side of the room it was a spectacle the man in cassock was on the floor sneezing and cursing in his impotence the three men laughed derisively at him ivan looked from a distance the devil had terrors for his superstitious heart even when a captive here lad selim cried to the apprentice dont be afraid-he cant bite you now pull his beard and see it come off if you pull it loose youll marry into a rich family ivan approached hesitated a moment then made for the man on the floor and the next moment the impetus of his own lurch backwards sent him toppling over with the mass of hair in his hands the prisoners face was smooth there was barely one days growth of beard on it ha selim exclaimed there we have he that prepareth the way  him plucked and peppered let me have his feathers ivan now then devil effendi weve got you where we want you -eh stanko the lord is too high and the czar is too far they say the innkeeper sagely reflected but whod have thought ikon-dealer that i was born to see the very devil right in my own cafe  such is life stanko of a priests cassock and a devils beard what ikon-dealer ever is afeared  -if he has a brother like my brother the archdeacon how long till sunset innkeeper the city man inquired stanko consulted his timepiece four hours traveler you are going somewhere sir selim inquired anxious to have as few people as possible around while he examined his prisoners pockets yes i must be in tetino by sundown let me go i tell you madman the man in cassock was protesting what in gods name do you take me for  in gods name we take you for the devil selim derisively explained but in my own name i take you for a shoveler in the den of lions for one that has dealings with some great on high do you ever remember your love-letters devil effendi oh-ho thats who i am eh he looked at his captor in amazement then the steely eye of the city man caught his and the prisoner grasped the unspoken message a mere shoveler more or less did not matter but he that prepareth he way could not be spared so thats who i am repeated the poliany schoolmaster so thats who you are retorted the effendi and this is what you have he pulled out of an inside pocket from under the victims shirt a bundle of papers and some sealing-wax dont look at these papers innkeeper selim cautioned theyll give you bad dreams you are going to tetino soon friend he turned to the city man who was apparently hesitating near the doorway yes must be going pretty soon the latter answered  gulbenk effendi is waiting for me in tetino to close a deal in rice selim effendi offered the rice-merchant a glass of brandy the latter merely touched it with his lips you also are going back this evening there was no question in his voice but selim answered yes as soon as  have made heads or tails of this devilish scribble in his papers so you really think you have the devil there  ivan go and get me another bottle of stanimuka wine selim ordered the apprentice stanko had gone to the inn proper to look after the wants of a peasant who was to stay overnight the devil he is for these cattle he explained but my name being selim effendi of tetino you can guess who this man is the capturing of this man wras worth some original maneuvering it will be a sensation in the konak to-morrow morning when selim effendi kicks the iron gates open and walks in with the trophy-what  it will be a sensation yes well good road to you effendi allah take care of you and the devil will look after your baggage iv selim was losing patience for the third time did you see your man from poliany or didnt you but the prisoner did not look up i could open that clam-shell mouth of yours on short notice but when i do i wrant to be your whole audience there has been hardly any one here to-day but who knows what a rabble of charcoal devils will be around here by sundown slowly the minutes passed as the effendi was struggling with the meaningless jargon of his victims papers he turned to his zaptieh in a low voice what do you think osman id rather be through with the farce and have this thing tied to the post next to that low peasant in our cellar that idiotic innkeeper may catch on to our game and i dont know his persuasion on matters political besides -that rice-merchant we should have held on to him i wyas foolish to blab so much i want to try my monkey-wrench argument with this devil and see whether it will loosen his jaw ho you little one we are going ivan loaded up with half a dozen bottles of brandy and prespa vintage and the effendi and osman dragged out the man in cassock  i wonder whether that schoolmaster of  adventure his from poliany is coming here after all ill wager you the onbashi never delivered the apostles letter as i ordered him what do you think osman the onbashi did deliver it dont you worry it was almost the first time the prisoner had spoken you fool answer my questions when you are the one asked and selims boot dug into his prisoners stomach they were just outside the gate when the innkeeper appeared from the other side of the courtyard hola stanko can you guess what i am going to do with him take him straight to my bishop in tetino and have him branded as the devil in public then send an account of it all to the patriarch in constantinople theyll make me an archdeacon for it and maybe an abbot if they do ill take you over to my monastery to look after the winery-what but the st georges stanko inquired i did not wish to open the package in the devils presence but you will find them there on the divan theyll pay for your brandy and prespa bottles st onuphry and st sophrony preserve you and st panteleimon multiply your children na dobur put zbogom the effendi replied in peasant fashion and stanko entered the cafe the others turned down the street towards the livery-stable where is your horse effendi osman noticed the empty stall the moment he entered the stable a folded piece of paper was nailed on the stall-bar selim snatched it and the same hand-printed sort of message in bulgarian greeted his eyes to the devil in stankos inn care of archdeacon ananiass brother from the den of lions--greeting he that prepareth the way sent you a message last sunday by a man who never returned yours is not a cowards heart robespierre fear not it was a wise whim of mine to change my disguise i knew you without being recognized myself but the little fool that shaved me took too long a time to it else the effendi would have found us together that brats slow bungling caused your capture but fear not my robespierre the ikon-dealer will never take you to the bishop you are worth nothing to him and selim effendi wont have enver pasha laugh at his story it is not cowardice that makes me desert you i am too much needed now keep your mouth locked and may your papers be never deciphered by selim and his like i leave you in your captors pocket but fear not nobody wants you you are useless baggage now and thats your safety i have bartered my two-mule carriage for the effendis horse a fine animal it will carry me where bloodhounds cant even sniff me of a rice-merchant with a shaven beard nor turk nor moslem ever is afeared selim effendi reread the message nonplused but only for a moment then he stuck the letter in front of the poliany schoolmasters nose  read it you crafty fox read this and see if you havent found your match whod have ever thought that rice-merchant was your man oh no you are not the apostle you are just plain robespierre of poliany that is if i am idiotic enough to believe what the real robespierre of poliany has written on this rag of paper but you wont eel out this time by any such trickery when i hang you upside down in my cellar youll tell me a different story robespierre of poliany did not reply his surprise at the apostles daring letter was second only to his amazement at the turks wrong interpretation of it of one thing at least he felt sure-he that prepareth the way was safe robespierres spirits rose and the efficient way in which he met selims threats made the latter waver a little who cculd tell but that the letter in his hands was actually penned by the apostle which one was the real bird if the thief of his horse were the real apostle he had gone to poliany the nearest insurgent center where assistance could be obtained selim had heard too much of the apostles trickeries to believe in the final way in which the writer of the letter consigned the prisoner of stankos inn to the kindness of destiny however even in case his first interpretation of the message was the correct one still the schoolmaster of poliany could have all the better reason for rousing up a relief party in poliany to save the captured apostle if only the onbashi there could be stirred into action selim effendi thought longingly of the tetino telegraph-office he wished the apostolic baggage were safely caged in his tetino cellar it was fast thinking and the conclusion reached wras a bold one osman selim shouted to the zaptieh mount your horse and gallop the life out of him straight to poliany rouse the onbashi to turn the whole village downside up and capture that rice-merchant also describe this man to him and let us see he that prepareth the way  whether you and i have been chasing a swarm of bees or a cloud of beetles i shall drive right back to the city with this baggage and wait for you and your news in my jail-cellar off with you osman think of the stake and dont lose a minute but hardly had osman vanished down the road when selim effendi realized the complexity of his situation for inside of two minutes he discovered the immediate reason for the rice-merchants making away with his horse one of the two mules that was to drive him and his prisoner to tetino was lame and would not budge an inch it was growing gloomier every minute a thick pulpy fog was settling all around mud-bespattered peasants with their charcoal-laden donkeys kept passing down the street all bound for tetino to sleep in the city and be on time bright and early for the wednesday bazaar on the morrow a couple of them stopped for a moment or two in front of the stable and stared at the puzzled police magistrate in a flash the turk had reached a decision he jumped at one of the peasants whose donkey looked the sturdier of the two here you come with me the charcoal was accordingly dumped on the street the rice-merchants mule and the peasants were mated to tug the rickety carriage and the charcoal-pedler turned driver the latter needed only to look from the barrel of selims long revolver to the bound figure of the man in cassock right inside the door to lose any idea of opposition which may have at first suggested itself to his peasant brain the turk lined his conveyance with stankos bottles and then a mohammedan fancy suggested a move characteristic of his failing for the humorous here you priest listen to me wasnt there a bishop once that rode into jerusalem on the back of an ass there was in his voice the scornful note of pretended ignorance the poliany schoolmaster did not look up you dont answer cur you charcoal dirt cant you talk either once i heard the priest chant something about that effendi well this time well have the devil himself riding into tetino on your donkeys back and the charcoalman had to assist the effendi while the latter piled the bulky frame of his prisoner on the donkeys back and fastened him on like a load of livady charcoal for the first time dascal zoeff of poliany loudly proclaimed his identity but the turk would not listen i dont want to hear another word from you till we enter my cellar shut up and he pulled out a dirty greasy rag from inside the stable and gagged his helpless victim now off with you as fast as you can drive right straight to tetino he yelled to the charcoalman ill hold this revolver pointed at your neck so dont you dare play any dirty games on me the peasants donkey announced the departure of the improvised train in shrill plaintive whinnies v  so you are a charcoal-pedler eh the team was at the outskirts of the village  my face would give me the lie if i said nay effendi the peasant spoke in the payak dialect a mixture of bulgarian and vlakh which the effendi understood but did not speak a tawny charcoalman he was his sooty smoky face plastered with the carbon dirt of a hundred charred pine-trees bore but a distant resemblance to a human countenance a black greasy sheepskin kalpak covered the major part of his cranium sunken beneath his singed eyebrows a pair of glassy orbs blinked with the colorless stupidity that only five centuries of thraldom can stamp upon the physiognomy of a race he was taciturn and conversed readily only with his donkey the rickety patter of the carriage disposed the effendi for the taste of stankos vintages bottle after bottle dropped by the roadside the last bottle would have followed its predecessors but the revolver slipped by the roadside instead without the turks being any the wiser the brandy and the prespa wine were a stupefying combination selim could think of nothing but tetino and his tongue rattled continually listen here look how is it now how is it-far to tetino is it far to tetino -tetino look you or ill blow your brains out for you and the effendi brandished the empty brandy-bottle the charcoalman noted the weapon and answered in his payak drawl  adventure three turns a down-you-go and there you be effendi twilight fell over the vardar valley and in less than an hour the evening fog was so impenetrable that the driver could see hardly more of the effendi than a pair of alcohol-glowing eyeballs the turnpike was deserted and the turk was drunk enver pashas guards were nowhere to be seen it was too raw a night for sentry-watches get up there get up just a little while longer brother the charcoalman yelled to his donkey and before selim could open his eyes the carriage had turned to the left from the tetino road and was creaking down a lane across muddy pastures and ricefields and past the bog-marshes of the vardar river the mismated team had some trouble in pulling the carriage in concord a mudhole that almost upset the carriage roused the drunken turk and he yelled at the peasant hey there you ill blow out your brains how is it-far to tetino  one more turn the down-you-go and there youll lie effendi the moslem grunted and relapsed into taciturnity cheer up my donkey cheer up my brother the driver called to his donkey except for an occasional nasal grunt the gagged schoolmaster on the donkeys back called no attention to his location pretty soon the loose-jointed carriage began pattering down a rather steep incline through the fog the brandy-dimmed orbs of selim effendi saw a flash of water some hundred elbow-lengths below look out there he yelled down there you ill blow out your brains see how it flickers whats that-hidden treas-ure-lights hidden frogs eyes the driver laughed back thats the down-you-go i was talking about  it didnt shine that way to me this morning when i came from tetino-tetino- how-is it far to tetino  dont suppose it did get up my donkey cheer up my brother were almost there and the peasant lashed the rice-merchants mule the charcoalmans donkey did not seem to like his comrades company as a result the improvised team had no definite policy in their work get up there bellowed the driver splash-splash went the team and the carriage seemed to sink all of a sudden into a quicksand quagmire look out you charcoal devil are you bogging me ill blow out your brains for you and the intoxicated turk jammed the empty bottle against the peasants neck is this tetino--or vardar river both are pretty close effendi but this is just a mud-pool haw there i or some little time the driver busied himself with the carriage wheels hammering at one in particular then he jumped to his seat again lashed the mule savagely and let go the team plunged ahead and the carriage sailed a thousand elbow-lengths into the fen then suddenly without any warning whatever something snapped the left front wheel splashed into the marsh the rig lost equilibrium and the turk yawped hey you charcoal devil there we are my donkey here we are my brother the driver yelled and there was a new ring in his voice he jumped on to the carriage-pole cursing and shouting in turns but not for very long the peasant with the mud-bespattered face and the colorless blinking eyes had unharnessed the team mounted the rice-mer-chants mule and was leading away his own donkey with the human baggage loaded thereon before the inebriate could realize what was happening the carriage began filling up with clammy creepy fen-mire that gripped selims feet in an icy clutch and shook him from his brandy-stupor the moslem leaped from his seat with an oath and aimed his empty wine-bottle at the dark figures in the mist but empty bottles do not pop cool your head effendi cool your head and warm your feet the voice was a little way off to the left and it was no longer payak dialect that the charcoalman spoke but pure bulgarian the bulgarian of selims two messages you are half-an-hours swim from dry land and another two hours walk from a living soul after we are gone it is almost freezing now effendi but the evil one doesnt bother folks in cold weather hey there you charcoalman youll grease the rope for this dont slander the trade selim i am a priest by training a revolutionist by faith the strangler  and an apostle by profession you remember that old priest in vodena whom you roasted on a spit like a lamb-chop that was my father-god rest his soul that was the story that greeted me when i came home from the seminary and those two girls the daughters of stephan the miller in novoselo and the carpenters bride of two months in ridovy yours is a long long story selim effendi and here is the last chapter you couldnt read those papers in the schoolmasters pocket here is something to satisfy your curiosity selim on the fifteenth of january in novoselo a congress will decide to light the fuse that will blow to smithereens your whole government but my brother-in-freedom is groaning on my donkeys back a cold nightmare to you effendi and may the charcoalmen bless me for ridding the land of another bloodsucker and the two figures vanished into the fog the wheel-rims had sunk out of sight the turk stared wildly around he could see nobody hear nobody far away in the distance his eyes could catch the faintest glimmer of what he imagined was tetino all around him wtas that glassy creepy serpentine ice-glaze of the treacherous livady morass and the carriage slowly sank sank he strangler paul etriem a young man whose clean-cut features and well-groomed figure clipped him sharply from among the riffraff of the lower quarter of the city picked his way deliberately among the loiterers of washington street and turned in with an air of leisurely consideration at a squalid corner saioon it was an unpromising place for such a man to quench his thirst half a dozen ragged loungers slouched about the musty ill-lighted barroom scowling suspiciously at each other or making flabby advances toward the white-aproned mixer of fancy beverages with the hazy idea apparently of scraping up enough courage to attempt  adventure to work him for a drink on credit-the credit of washington street where every second man was a thief or worse the newcomer skirted the ranks of these practical-minded philosophers and approached the bar with something of an effort he swung a gladstone bag up in front of him and let it settle with a thud on the rosewood barrier a glass of half-and-half he requested inspecting the bartender through two keen level and half-amused eyes he emptied his glass deliberately unconscious of the fact or indifferent to it that the room was still and that a dozen coarsely wrrapped packages of emotions-mostly crude ungentle emotions-wre watching him greedily then he unsnapped the clasp of the gladstone bag and took from it something-a long stoutly sewted sack of heavy duck sodden with its burden of metal disks- disks that chinked and rubbed jovially together giving out strange music the silence that had settled over the room remained unbroken but the air quivered and thrilled with pent and explosive lusts and passions the sack was full of gold and more sacks like it could be seen in the gladstone bag stacked trimly together or elbowing for room with packages of bank-notes no wonder the grip wtas heavy here was a load for a strong man to try his muscles upon-and one worth carrying  a rockefeller or a morgan might have stooped to pit his strength against the inertia of this burden for it constituted a millionaires ransom the bartender came roughly out of his stupor you fool he cried you-you- fool what do you mean coming in here with all them beans on you are you trying to give this house a bad name-want to get your wooden head split open in front of our bar and have the police nail us up what-what in- he paused panting with anger words- even the coarse bitter words of the quarter below the dead-line-failed to ease his burning sense of injustice the young man of the gladstone bag smiled a calm impersonal smile he had taken a coin from the top of the open sack now he replaced the sack and closed the grip he even seemed oblivious to the fact that the room had filled suddenly as if the tropic heat of mens greed had caused a rising of the moral atmosphere so that other creatures of the street had been sucked in stevedores and shanty-boatmen americans jews greeks and even chinamen- they skulked close to him licking parched ashy lips and the creator of all this excitement paid his bill counted his change and then apparently as a matter of routine slipped a magazine pistol from his side pocket and examined it critically the little flat hammer was drawn down like the head of a viper and the safety lever stuck straight back apparently satisfied by this inspection the young man turned and wtalked toward the door occasional stupid or sullen figures barred his way but an instants smiling regard from those ironical gray eyes cleared the path as if by magic a moment later the room was empty-empty save for the score or so of white-faced rat-eyed vags and floaters by the eternal the bartender blasphemed hoarsely  that knobs got the gall of a brass hippopotamus come in here with all that agony on him-and i wouldnt like to be the gent to try to lift it neither that grin of hisd throw a cold wave into the pit of hell itself a few of the loiterers in the saloon recovering more quickly than their fellows from the stupor of the moment had hurried out into the street after the departed visitor he was gone however at any rate only one person succeeded in keeping within sight of him and that one was not proclaiming the fact even in a stage whisper blondie doyle with his eyes glowing like the eyes of some night-hunting beast of prey stood unobtrusively in the shadow of a row of warehouses blondie hadnt followed the stranger from the saloon-he knew a trick worth a dozen of that he had preceded him having melted from the room while his companions were crowding toward the storm-center blondie never lost his head never yielded to impulses of mere curiosity or wonder he needed his head in his business and thanks to his adroit use of foresight and of a sort of constructive imagination that was natural to him blondie had been safely hidden when the man with the satchel emerged moreover he had taken up his hiding- the strangler  place in the right quarter for the stranger came directly toward him after dodging into the unlightcd alley which blondie had chosen as his probable path of exit in a moment he passed walking swiftly and very quietly and went on up the gap cut between rows of warehouses of course the others had been too late to see him disappear into this gloomy crevice-blondie had foreseen that too lie waited till the soft-footed pedestrian had advanced almost into the edge of the muffling blanket of darkness then slid out of the friendly doorway that had sheltered him blondie was working with the ease and adroitness of one who knows his trade by feel as well as by sight he need not keep behind sheltering projections for the man ahead neither paused nor turned blondie gained upon him till he wras within a dozen paces and held this distance for half a block ahead the alley was flat and bare there would be something to hide presently and the strangler waited for an arcaway a little farther along there appeared the sunken entrance to a deserted basement blondie knewr the place as well as he knew his own strong fingers and in an instant he had lessened the gap between himself and the man with the gladstone bag running easily and without a sound although he had left the saloon too early to see the pistol which the other carried he knew perfectly well that the man with the grip was armed every one who came below the dead-line was armed for a moment he paused studying at close hand the details of the figure before him he noted that the bag had grown no lighter the man who carried it was breathing hard and even as blondie threw himself forward he saw the other swing his burden heavily from liis right hand to his left men had been garroted recently in dark side streets of the town-gaily dressed theater-goers whose diamonds twinkled red and green in the rays of distant street lights business men carrying wallets or steel cash-boxes blondie remembered some of them as he leaped upon the man with the gladstone bag-none of them had come into his hands so easily as had this present victim his left forearm crossed the others throat and a hand was locked behind his head there was a strangling sob-which being a familiar sound in the garroters business produced no effect upon blondie he merely drew the struggling figure nearer striking upward as he did so with his knee he had frequently found this blow over the kidneys a decidedly sedative application in such cases and then as he grunted a little and drew himself closer to his prisoner something happened it came very quickly and one event melted into another with such perplexing rapidity that the garroter lost all knowledge of sequence a hand gripped his wrist and twisted it forcibly around till the whole arm was strained and tense as a fiddle-string blondie felt the stab of millions of needles along the tortured nerve-fibers and then after an evanescent impression of lightness and flight he fell with a great jar and was lying pinned by his still imprisoned arm something-probably a knee-was pressed mercilessly into the hollow of his neck and against the bone of his jaw almost before blondie knew that he was on the ground he was twisted over face down and both arms were being pried up toward his shoulder-blades he grunted with pain but the man who wtas kneeling upon him merely gave his wrists an extra shove and proceeded to bind them tightly together next the garroters ankles were roped and presently blondie transformed into a long and uncouth bundle wras rolled with his face toward the distant silver-white strip that represented the sky in the shadow of the narrow unlighted way he could just make out the calmly scrutinizing face of his captor the young man of the satchel next moment the latter spoke you came nearer making it than i intended to let you my man he commented grimly you certainly know how to administer a very efficient choking- although your hold lacks science now i could teach you-but well talk of that another time you arent hurt anywhere are you this question seemed to blondie doyle so utterly ridiculous so absolutely and gratuitously silly that he merely continued to stare into the hard smiling eyes that looked into his own it was as if he should ask a victim from whom he had just taken by his  adventure own peculiar methods of finance a roll of bills or a diamond stud whether he were having a good time his companion seemed to understand blondies point of view for he laughed and continued it isnt that i give a continental about you as an individual he explained coolly id have broken your neck and thought nothing of it if i hadnt needed you-but well talk this over in my quarters just lie still a bit will you he got up and stood looking at blondie then stooped quickly and lifted him in his arms quite easily in spite of the stranglers one hundred and eighty-odd pounds of brawn  ill just leave you in this cellar entrance while i attend to a little business he said speaking more to himself than to blondie ill be back directly this was gratifying news to the garroter who had the pleasure of being deposited in the areaway he had chosen for his victim for a moment he could see the lithe figure of his mysterious captor framed in the murky light of the upper alley then he was alone in spite of the fact that blondie had reasons for not caring to await his captors return he was unable to budge the knots that bound him he writhed about and strained and twisted cursing in the meantime with all the earnestness of a devout brahman singing incantations he was still fighting a useless battle some twenty minutes later when he heard a sound that made him pause in puffing blasphemous wonder it was the hum of a motor-car which evidently was feeling its way toward him through the gloom of the midnight presently it stopped and a moment later the same lithe figure which had disappeared up the stairs came bounding down them and again blondie was gathered into a pair of terrible arms-arms such as he had never dreamed of scrapper and ex-ringman though he was easys the word my boy the young man laughed as he clambered back to the street level a taxicab with its red and green guard-lights casting weird daubs of color into the strange corners of the neighborhood stood beside the strip of rotting soggy boards that represented a sidewalk the driver jumped down and opened the door as the strange pair approached you can follow the main streets if he makes a rumpus ill quiet him the man who carried blondie commented throw up my grip will you larry  the garroter would have liked to nudge himself just to be sure he was awake he saw the chauffeur stagger toward the door carrying the gladstone bag that had baited him blondie doyle into this trap the thing was deposited on the floor of the cab the driver fastened the door whose curtain was pulled low and next instant there was the whir and grind of machinery thrown into gear and he felt himself being borne swiftly through the darkness toward his unknown destination ii for a while the cab lurched as it crept forward but gradually it gained speed and blondie decided the chauffeur had made his way into better-lighted streets and that the underworld had been left behind he felt a decided reluctance toward anything in the way of an outcry or alarm for even if he had forgotten the sinister comment of his companion to the driver he realized that he was not exactly in a strategic position for any such move truly the police might succeed in stopping the cab and making an investigation but blondie felt not the slightest desire to be investigated so he leaned stolidly back against the cushions glancing from time to time at the blotch of white that stood for the face of his captor after what he estimated as half on hours ride the machine swerved beneath him slowed down and stopped the door was opened and the young man beside blondie jumped out keep your eye on my friend for a moment he requested the driver as he grasped the heavy bag and stepped upon the walk with it blondie saw that the cab had stopped outside an old-fashioned stone house one of a row of similar buildings under the narrow porch a light glimmered casting feeble rays upon wide stone steps he saw the man with the grip pass rapidly up these steps admit himself with a key and disappear the strangler  he was out again next moment and was standing beside the cab im going to free your feet he told blondie but id advise you not to make the mistake of trying to get away the strangler imagined that the chauffeur must have been paid in advance or that some regular understanding in regard to pay existed between him and this eccentric person who was now leading him blondie doyle up a flight of stone stairs for he heard the regular cicada-like hum of the receding machine for the first time in his life there came into this strong mans consciousness a vague troubling half-realized sensation of fear-he was alone with a person whose like he had never encountered he knew the terrible strength of that hand which rested lightly on his arm but there was a subtle impression of moral power of dominant wili-force in the others mere silent presence that cowed blondie and forced him to stumble along sullenly and without a definite thought of flight or resistance the door of the stone house opened and closed the air was wonderfully cool and sweet within-the heated dusty city seemed to have recedcd into an infinitely distant past so that the strangler might have been on one of the planets something clicked and he stood blinking in the yellow light of an overhead lamp he saw that he was standing in a broad reception-hall and then he wras pushed forward and through an open doorway the lights here were turned on and blondie uttered an exclamation-something white with great dark holes for eyes and with its wonderfully perfect teeth gleaming at him in a sardonic grin faced him from under a glass cover nearly level with his face the man beside blondie smiled  theyre harmless when they get to that stage my friend he commented have a chair- ill remove your bonds after weve reached an agreement the stranglers glance took in other details of the room bookcases and reading-tables of circassian walnut a microscope and some instruments on a table of white enamel and plate glass some curious crooked-bladed swords on the wall-and then his eyes were drawn to his captors face the young man of the gladstone bag sat opposite him smiling almost benevolently ill wager its some time since you had as interesting an evening as this he said genially not that im running down your ordinary devices for passing the time -if youre the man im looking for you have not lived the life of a church warden hitherto but i think this has been a little unusual now let me ask you a question do you want to earn some money-more money than you probably ever saw before blondies eyes narrowed he was beginning to grow accustomed to the unusual and the mention of money and of a chance of acquiring some of it thoroughly stilled and poised his thoughts he stared intently at the speaker ill tell you what i want you to do the latter continued and you can decide whether you care to take the risks in a small house standing by itself in the north part of town at an address wrhich i will furnish you later an old gentleman lives alone except for a cat the old man and i worked together once at the project of making artificial diamonds of commercial size we didnt succeed but one of the byproducts of our work wtas a discovery that was worth infinitely more to the world and perhaps to us we made rubber synthetically pure perfect rubber with all the qualities of the tree-grown product he paused for a moment to watch the effcct of this statement on the strangler but blondie was far from being impressed he stared back indifferently and with an amused shrug of disgust the young man continued rubber is worth more from the viewpoint of political economy than diamonds and i imagine this process is wrorth more in money than one for turning out perfect stones would be however thats neither here nor there my part of the work was largely that of a superintendent in a factory i had the general theory and i had worked out many of the details i hired professor hueber to help me with the myriads of formulae that must be tested and retained or rejected it was trying nerve-wrecking work and at times the old man showed signs of giving out a weeks rest usually put him on his feet again however he worked at this for two years and then late one night he sent a messenger to my house to tell me that he had finished- that quite by accident he had found the  adventure missing element and that the specimen of gum which he wtas sending had come out of his retort not more than half an hour before he told me that he was exhausted and that he would retire at once and asked me to come to the laboratory at ten the next morn- ing j  the young man paused to open a drawer from which he took a square of a dark red substance which he held up in front of blondie doyle it wtas a pliable and elastic solid which seemed to the strangler not a w-hit different from any other square piece of rubber this is what he sent me the speaker continued and from laboratory tests i have corroborated the old mans statement this rubber grew in a retort instead of a tree and the secret of making it is worth millions you may be sure that i went to the laboratory at ten next morning but at first the house seemed to be deserted after i had knocked the third time a window was cautiously lifted above-stairs and some one dropped a cylinder of paper out on the steps beside me i picked it up and found that it was a note addressed to me in a peculiarly irregular hand i read it through twice-and then i realized that the old scientist had lost his reason the strain ending in sudden and unexpected success had completely maddened him he stated that he had worked out the formulae and had put them together with my manuscripts which detailed the preliminary work into a receptacle in the house and had contrived a series of electrical connections so that from any point in his laboratory or living-rooms he could press a button which would ignite and utterly destroy the whole accumulation of material he had blundered upon the perfecting link in the chain and it was his to do with as he pleased he would wager it against my share in the work if i could obtain the manuscript it was mine but if he caught me within the house he would set off his infernal machine and put the discovery forever beyond my reach again the young man paused and sat watching blondie his eyes with their hint of glacial ice and of uncompromising determination narrowed and fierce what i wrant is a man with the courage and the skill to enter this house at night and get these papers he will have this great advantage over me that if he is caught at the work he will be taken for an ordinary burglar-and the manuscript will not suffer he must be one built and trained for the business cool even in danger and defeat alert and strong and determined and for this service i will pay ten thousand dollars without a proviso or hitch he will receive the money in any shape he desires to take it in and will be free to spend it openly without danger of protest or molestation now then do you want it   he slid close to blondie and shot out this last question with such force that the strangler blinked there was little considering to be done however blondie had followed the young mans narrative closely enough to be able to understand what was required from him it was in his line and he knew that he could do it if it could be done you can deal me in he said speaking gruffly and for the first time since he had been captured one thing i wants to ask boss supposn i tries my best and doesnt find the stuff-what then does i get the coin or the boot-toe the scientist laughed do your best and youll not fail he predicted i can tell you just vhere to look but if anything goes wrong you wont lose your reward the gods of this world have dealt bountifully with me and i deal bountifully with those wrho try honestly to serve me i believe you are my man i fished for big fish the sight of so much money scared out the little fellows and you wrho had the courage to follow into so forbidding a country should have both the courage and the ability to succeed very easily against this old man he was smiling into blondies face and the strangler felt his heart slow down and then start to sprint-there was something almost terrifying in that smile ill where blondie crouched in the shadow of a hedge in the outskirts of the city he might have been again plunged into his own underworld of gloom and darkness about him however scattered cottages wrere set in squares of lawn and garden and the fragrance of a bank of roses came to him heavy and stifling as with the sodden breath of the night the strangler  it was that deadest of all dead and lifeless periods two oclock in the morning somewhere near at hand a rooster flopped his wings and crowed raucously id like to have a hind leg of you fried the strangler grumbled as he finished unlacing the second of his shoes and pulled it off with a jerk i could pretty near get it down raw with the feathers on thats the old bucks house all right ill go in by that half window-the pantry or maybe a bathroom he straightened up and walked across the dewy turf pausing below the open window just long enough to look back and to listen for any sound from within or without the world was as still as it could have been before the first sunrise however and with an easy movement blondie reached up hooked his hands over the sill and lifted himself till he was staring into the darkness of the room beyond cautiously he slid through and felt the cool touch of polished wood beneath his bare feet in his earlier years before he became a garroter blondie had done work of this kind the memory of old times came to him now and he worked with the poise and mastery of a thorough tradesman he found the door and let himself into a corridor then felt his way forward touching doors on each side and stopping at the end of the passage to consider he had kept his turnings and advances straight in mind and knew exactly where he was in relation to the outer lines of the building also he knew where he was according to a sketch which his employer had drawn for him he listened attentively again then grasped the knob of the door before him drew it firmly toward him and turned it quickly to avoid any chance squeaks or quavers with the same swift motion he shoved the door open and was standing inside the room at the end of the passage straggling blue rays from a distant arc light were reflected from rows of bottles and scattered articles of glass and metal on benches about the wall and by this uncertain light blondie made out that he had entered a large room fitted up as a laboratory from it there opened at the side farthest from the strangler a smaller room toward this he headed this is going to be chicken-pie for me he mumbled ten thousand plunks-say ill buy a buzz-wagon n ill ride around below the line n show em how to hit her up ill- cheered almost intoxicated by thoughts of his own coming grandeur blondie was nevertheless alert enough to hear a stealthy sound near him he whirled jerking up one arm automatically to fend off a possible blow aimed at his head or face at the same instant he became conscious of something tightening about his chest binding one arm firmly to his side and biting and burning into his flesh till he cried out in agony he realized that a noose had settled over him and that he was being lifted from the floor next moment the room was filled with blinding blue light and as the strangler spun slowly about like some great bird trussed before a fire he saw a tall old man dancing about in imminent danger of falling from a gallery near the ceiling so ho my bird-my fish-my dainty gazelle i have you fast and safe at the first shot dont pluck at the rope my beauty for its made of steel fibers carefully tempered ill let you down after ive looked you over blondie caught fleeting glimpses of him stalking along the gallery and down the narrow stairs at the end then the old man was standing beside him he was a tall lean white-haired old man garbed in some nondescript night-garment in two pieces and bound about the waist with a doubled strand of cord the strangler took in these details one at a time as he slowed to a standstill and hung swaying his captor was looking him over with his head tipped back and his thin high-bridged nose apparently ready to peck at blondie like an eagles beak what did you come here for the old man demanded suddenly blondie stared at him with a sort of fascination that bound his tongue and held him almost hypnotized the feeling had come over him that the old man was a dream that this whole night of vicissitudes and misadventures was a series of very evil nightmares caused by dope in his drink or too much free lunch a glint of anger kindled in the old mans eyes and he whirled about and strode away he refuses to talk the strangler heard him muttering well i have a cure for that-he shall experience the exquisite torture  o adventure the words buzzed about in blondies throbbing head like a lonely bee in a barrel leaving him just where he had been before- half suffocated by the binding weight about his chest and wholly stupefied by the totality of his surroundings he saw the old man skim up the narrow stairs and appear directly over him on the gallery he heard the clink of glass then his captor was peering over at him duck your head my stubborn beauty he shrilled angrily if this stuff goes in your eyes you will never again behold the light in this mortal existence duck- duck-- blondie had just sense enough to tip his head as far forward as the strain of his position would allow and next moment something splashed against the exposed back of his neck instantly there seemed to be a superheated iron searing and corroding the tissues blondie threw his free hand back and another drop splashed upon that when he brought it around with a wild sweep of his arm a purple blotch had appeared it puffed up as the garroter looked and stabbing pains shot through his arm and shoulder he seemed to be in some infernal machine with two white-hot poles scorching him reason was quickened by his extremity and he realized that he must do something to appease the wrath of his mad captor or he would be consumed alive by this terrible caustic i beg he cried come down and ill talk-i didnt mean to keep mum but you got me hoodooed he heard the old man chuckling with satisfaction as he sped back along the gallery and down the steps and desperately his mind went groping about for a means of still further pacifying him if only he could entice him near enough to lay his one free hand on him blondies jaws ground with sudden rage and he felt the trammeled blood boiling up into his head for a moment things turned red then the old man was peering curiously into his face now then he said briskly before i ask you to talk let me warn you that you got off easily this time the next- he held up a long slim needle-like piece of steel which glistened in the blue light-the next time wte have any trouble i will make just one thrust into you with this my pipkin and the haunts that have known you will know you no more forever this needle is inoculated with the virus of anthrax my infant-anthrax malignant pustule my beauty youll die a beautiful death-and one false answer will bring all this beatitude into your life he paused apparently to let the full terror of this statement sink into blondies consciousness the strangler watched him fearfully eying the infected needle for brief intervals then letting his glance wander back-which it did of its own free will-to the white lean forbidding face of the mad scientist he noticed that there was a patch of rust near the end of the needle as if it had been dipped into some thick liquid and allowed to dry slowly blondie was densely ignorant on the subject of bacteriology but something grimly assuring in the old mans presence convinced him that life for blondie doyle now hung by a veritable spider-web if only he could lay hold of that long lean neck- what did you come in here for the old man demanded  i came in for money or jewelry or whatever i could find blondie told him he felt the others eyes drilling into the recesses of his being but as he was merely lying now not openly defying his captor he felt that he was safe jewtelry the old man scoffed do i look like the kind to wear jewelry i never saw you afore blondie assured him earnestly you cn believe me boss i wouldnt have set foot in this blasted house if id ha kncwed you was here let me down i  go away now-fer gawds sake let me down afore i smothers with the weight of this noose most of this speech seemed to have passed over his companions head the old man stood with his lean chin in his hand his elbow resting against the pit of his stomach he was studying blondie as he might have studied a strange crystal gradually a film seemed to gather over his eyes and he swayed a little as he stood peering at his prisoner blondie felt his flesh quivering-a little more and he would topple within reach evidently the old man was going into some kind of fit the stranglers arm knotted spasmodically and he stared straight at his captor again the old man swayed toward him blondie hardly realized that his own body jerked to meet the other as his free arm shot out there was a scream as of some the strangler  one awakening from an ugly dream and that lean figure so near his own danced back out of reach then swtooped down upon him blondie saw the old mans uplifted arm descend felt the stab of the needle through his shoulder and in his mad terror he struck out with all the power his position would allow him his maul-like fist caught the scientist  the point of the chin and the old man toppled backward at the same instant the stranglers strained senses gave way and felty blackness filled his mind and seemed to puff out into the room he hadnt fainted he blondie doyle was as conscious of himself as he had ever been in his life but that isolating blackness seemed to have severed him by an infinite distance from the rest of the universe through this cloud he seemed to hear steps running heard as from another world a door open then all was silent ejvsg when his eyes opened he was lying ejswll on the floor staring up at a tube which gave out a blue-green radiance he turned slightly and groaned-his whole body ached and throbbed and he saw that some one had bandaged his hand and felt a pad pressing against the back of his neck he remembered the old mans terrible threat and the stab of the needle through his shoulder and sat up suddenly with a scream some one behind him spoke quietly  youd best lie down for a while youve been under quite a strain and youve two bad acid burns ive dressed them and you wont suffer much inconvenience from them youve laid the professor out as limp as hell be at the last day-lie still while i see what i can do for him but the needle blondie raved the old bloat said it was poison n he got me in the shoulder afore i could land on him fer gawds sake mister do something fer me afore i swells up and busts his needle was as harmless as any other needle the voice behind blondie assured him the speaker came over and stood above him-it was the young man of the gladstone bag serene and gentle as if he were playing dominoes he was always a little off on such things but i sterilized all of these playthings of his before he barred me from the house ill cut the puncture open and clean it out with permanganate presently but you do not need to worry blondie turned as the other left him rolling painfully until he could see the opposite side of the room the old man was lying on a blanket his white hair and colorless skin livid and ghastly in the blue light of the laboratory be-be you sure he aint dead boss blondie demanded hoarsely forgetting for a moment his own troubles hes not dead although you gave him a bad tumble for a few moments the strangler lay watching the pair gradually a tinge of color came into the old mans face and his hands twitched then with a long sigh he turned his head and opened his eyes staring for a while at the silent figure above him suddenly he sprang up and held out his hand joyously why danny boy he cried i must have gone to sleep at my bench is it morning surely it is oh my friend my friend ive had such dreams-but weve won danny weve won the great prize listen it was glucose that did it quite by accident-in desperation you might say-i tried it i meant to have sent you some of the gum as it came from the retort but i must have fallen asleep the young man of the gladstone bag smiled you sent me the gum professor he said gently and i came and found you -sleeping i brought a man with me in case there was any little cleaning up to be done about the place you have finished your work my friend and you must go for a long vacation he led the old man over to a chair and watched him sink into it iv the scent of dewy rose-gardens came to blondie as he limped across the lawn and dropped down beside the hedge to put on his shoes he paused to take from the inner pocket of his coat a letter written on stiff linen paper and tucked into an open envelope he had had it read to him knew that it was addressed to the president of the citizens national bank and that it authorized that gentleman to see that the accompanying check for ten thousand dollars was paid to the bearer without question io adventure for the first time in ten hours a grin spread itself over the stranglers face hes the limit he growled admiration and fear and wonder in his guttural tone used me fer bait sent me ahead to keep the old bloat busy sos he could swipe the stuff hisself n he had it afore me n old knobs come to the last round say i earned the money all right all right the old oyster cooked me to a t where he got at it but aint i the doctor though whod ha thought a crack like that on the mug would ha jarred the cobwebs outn his noodle i ought to put in a bill fer curin him he folded the check and the letter and put them back carefully into his pocket stooped pulled one shoe into place then drew out the envelope and repeated the process of examining its contents in the name of ham howm i goin to spend it he demanded slowly say blondieyoure agoin to travel youre agoin to see the world only first youll get a buzz-wagon n youll make em all climb posts n hydrants down below the line youve got money my boy-youre rich he stuffed the envelope back and caught up the other shoe in a sudden frenzy then he settled back with a groan the bank dont open till ten oclock he reminded himself disconsolately with an elephant hunter in africa ahzed jordan hite men had not cared to venture among the wander- obos little was known of them  but this little was enough it pertained to the tribes wildness and its stealthy ways of fighting on the rare occasions when a man of another tribe so far forgot himself in chasing game as to enter a wanderobo forest he would find everything serene there would be no unusual sound or movement the stillness of the woods broken only by the singing of birds and perhaps by the cries of animals would cause him to believe that he was far from the haunts of ma  but suddenly seemingly from nowhere would come a poisoned arrow then another and another so it was that the forests and sweeping plains of the wanderobo country on the highlands of german east africa six thousand feet above the sea had been free from white invasion it was ideal for hunting every kind of game stalked its own prey in the scrub and belts of woodland in the high grass elephants grazed quietly for me the elephants had a special interest since at that time there were no german regulations to prevent a man from shooting a sufficient number of the animals on a single hunt to gain a small fortune from the ivory i had been on a long cattle-trading trek among the lumbwa and wras indulging in a bit of civilization in the towns along the uganda railway but growing tired of this i made up my mind to go on an elephant hunt in wanderobo land the project involved no great risk on my part because while the wanderobos knew with an elephant hunter in africa  no other white man they knew me a year before i had come upon a band of them and had been able to win their favor by killing a lion which had carried off a wanderobo girl i had hunted with them and had learned their peculiar dialect a rather musical jargon not unlike that of the lumbwa which i knew well with as little delay as possible after deciding upon the trip for ivory i left the railway and in ten days was in camp with twenty carriers on a grassy slope reaching away from the magor river in a dense wood a little way up the stream were some huts made by bending the tops of saplings to the ground and covering them with grass and sticks and so concealed in the underbrush as to be impossible to see until one was close upon them these constituted a temporary wanderobo village because of the necessity of drawing to within twenty-five or thirty yards of game before they could kill it with their arrows the wanderobos wrere almost always hungry so i fared forth each morning after the dew was off the grass to provide meat not only for my own men but also for my savage friends whom i expected to help me in my elephant hunt always on these tramps i searched for tracks of the big animals that were my special quest and one forenoon i found them the grass was much trampled and showed long streaks where the elephants had passed through when i entered the wanderobo village that afternoon i sent my boy for the chief and informed him that many elephants were grazing along the ronganda hills this news caused excitement the wanderobos had not seen the tracks themselves because the lumbwa their deadly enemies were known to hunt among these hills and on this account my friends had kept away but they were eager of course for information about the elephants the moran or warriors clad in monkey-skins and armed with spears and arrows gathered around me to convince them absolutely of the presence of the herd i sent my boy back to camp for a saucer and a small tin of kerosene when he had returned and had handed me these articles i drew back from the group of savages to perform a little witchcraft watch me i exclaimed into this saucer i am about to pour some water i will touch the water with fire if the elephants are still within our reach the water  will blaze up if it does not blaze the elephants have gone and we will have to be satisfied with poorer meat we will see to the kerosene i then applied a match when the wanderobos craning their necks saw the flame they raised their voices in a shout of joy i motioned to the chief and witch-doctor and we three withdrew to make our plans it was arranged that four men start at dawn to locate the herd these runners came in the morning to my camp and shivering in my tent door i gave them instructions and watched them disappear in the half-light around the hill a little later all the other warriors gathered about my tent and we went on a hunt for zebra and antelope to provide the wtomen and children with meat while the men were hunting elephants upon our return in the evening we found the runners already back with the information that many elephants were feeding only eight miles away the wanderobo warriors scattered to make preparations for the hunt withdrawing into the thick bush out of sight of the women and children who it is believed by this tribe render the poison harmless if they come too near when it is being smeared upon the arrows but the women were not idle they were clutching handfuls of grass throwing it into the air and chanting weirdly oesenie sirreon engail o great spirit bring us fortune the news that elephants were to be hunted had been carried by runners to every wanderobo village within twenty miles and all night warriors kept coming in in the morning about one hundred and fifty of them had assembled a strange collection of savages who jumped and yelled half-crazy from eating as part of the preparations for the killing leaves of the culie or morie a bush which produces an intoxicating juice we delayed our start until forenoon not intending to attack the elephants that day but to go into camp and be ready for the hunt at dawn keeping a sharp lookout for wandering lumbwa we established ourselves after a march of three hours on a hillside and sent four men ahead to see where the herd was moving i went out to procure meat for the big party and in the course of the day dropped three antelopes and two water-buck a sufficient supply of food for all meanwhile the runners had returned and re-  adventure ported that there were about two hundred elephants in the herd including many bulls and that one of these the leader was very large with tusks about six feet long this meant nine feet when the ivory was taken out since the lip covers about six inches and two feet and a half are in the head there was a feast that night around a huge fire the tnoran leaped and shouted breaking the silence of the night with the doleful sound of the elephant-hunt song and appearing with the flickering firelight shining upon their dark bodies more like strange demons than human beings at last they ceased the ceremonies quiet came disturbed only by the occasional deep-throated growl of a lion stalking its prey and now and then by the dismal cry of a hyena in the hills but after a while my rest was interrupted by a fresh outbreak of noise among the wanderobos and i arose to see what the savages were about they had thrown more fuel upon the fire and labersonie the chief tall and very old stood in its light with the moran gathered around him at attention he was giving them a shauri or talk and i crept up quietly to listen el moran my warriors the old chief was saying to-morrow we hunt the beast which gives us all we require plenty of meat food for our wives and children a skin that makes good sandals and ivory which we can sell for cows and oxen and so have milk for our children when sickness comes now the elephants must be slain only by men with strong arms and without fear perhaps some of you are afraid if this is so there is time to return to the women menutukie this is your first time with the great animal of the forest your father was a hunter when he and i were moran together but perhaps his son has not the courage of the warrior who is gone who met his death through the terror of the bush the buffalo perhaps you would like to climb a good tree and watch how warriors kill the forest king menutukie became greatly excited at these words leaping into the air and wildly shaking his bow i think there was a half smile on labersonies face for he was in the habit of thus inspiring his warriors on the n ght before a foray and evidently was a master of the art as some of his moran became so frenzied that others had tcold them i felt that the coming hunt would be a good one but feared that the loud and continued shouting might alarm the elephants the grass was wet and the air chilly when we started at sunrise toward the herd three moran had been sent out an hour earlier to ascertain whether the elephants had shifted during the night the close proximity of the latter was indicated after a tramp of an hour or so by the sudden appearance of a rhino which tore out of the bush and maddened with fear of the elephants the rhinos mortal enemy was ready to attack and trample any moving thing in his way lumberingly but swiftly he was bearing down upon us yet i did not want to take the chance of startling the elephants by a shot this somewhat trying situation was relieved by some moran who rushed at the rhino with their spears and succeeded in turning him to the right we reached the top of a high hill called the soiat and there we came upon the men who had gone out in advance they pointed down the slope to a stretch of level ground where just visible above the tall grass i saw the big backs and heads of the grazing herd the elephants were feeding slowly toward a belt of forest in which after their mornings grazing they would lean against trunks of trees until the noonday heat had passed knowing that the wanderobos will never attack elephants in the open i called a halt we rested and watched the herd disappear beneath the branches then we made ready for the onslaught each warrior streaked his face with a black powder prepared from burnt wood by the wtitch doctor to render him invisible to the elephants old labersonie sent some men across the level to the edge of the forest where i was told two saplings would be bent together into an arch through which everybody must pass in order to please engai the spirit we had arranged that two companies of twenty men each should take positions on either side of the elephants that i and twenty men should line up where the animals were likely to leave the forest and that the remainder of the party should circle around the herd and drive it toward us we separated and quickly took our stations for a while we waited then i heard a faint crashing steadily becoming louder in a moment i could distinguish the differ- with an elephant hunter in africa  ent sounds-the cracking of small trees the roars of the bulls the shrill cries of the cows the yeliing of the savages suddenly the elephants broke into sight ears extended and trunks uplifted they came ponderously but rapidly and directly toward us i knew that i should have to do good shooting to escape alive from the stampede and i lost no time the reports of my rifle promptly adding to the din of yells and roars at the first shot i dropped a big bull but still they came on i shot another and then another of the leaders of the herd but those behind swerved round the prostrate ones and still came swinging on frenzied by the savage cries behind them i thought they would never turn and saw myself trampled beneath their feet but suddenly a big bull waving his trunk like a signal swerved to the left the mob followed and for a moment we were safe mongaso mongaso the men of my party shouted this was their name for me but i had no ears for it just then being too intent on a bull which had left the herd and was still bearing down upon us my first shot hit him in the trunk and he did not stop i fired again the bullet reached the mark this time and the great beast swayed and sank meanwhile the warriors who had driven ths herd out of the forest had jumped in among them they were shooting arrows in all directions dodging eluding the big bodies almost by inches it looked as if their superstition about the black powder with which they streaked their faces must be correct for no other men could have mingled in that stampede and come out alive but in a moment their stock of arrows wras exhausted and they crouched in the grass as the mob thundered past them now they gathered round me shouting my name again and telling of the number of elephants killed and together we started to search for bodies in the grass in each there were numerous arrows and some showed wounds where imbedded arrows had been pulled out by the elephants themselves with their trunks the chief sent runners to bring the women and children and gave orders to cut up the meat for a big feast when the final tally of dead elephants was made i found that they numbered eighteen bulls and twelve cows the next day at camp i sent my men back for the ivory the largest pair of tusks weighed two hundred and ninety-one pounds and altogether i had about eighteen hundred pounds of ivory which at the rate of about three dollars a pound meant that i should realize a substantial profit when i reached the trading-posts along the uganda railway ii my next elephant hunt was for  pleasure although not so much for my own pleasure as that of a gentleman from the netherlands whom i happened to meet at the outpost of ikona in german east africa and who had plenty of money and desired excitement we started with a good outfit and a few carriers my dutch friend having never before been on a real hunt in the bush found the march over the hills and plains through scrub and forest somewhat laborious but he was game enough and we arrived in six days at the beautiful alama river here we camped and after resting for a day started early in the morning to meet the elephants it was not long before we came upon the first detachment of the herd about one hundred bulls cows and calves wrere grazing in the elephant grass my companion who had talked bravely about what he would do with his rifle when he saw an elephant now began to ask questions about the safety of shooting into the herd i paid no attention to him being too busy aiming at a fine bull but the dutchmans nervousness may have interfered with the accuracy of my own shot at all events it was a poor one and the elephant was merely wounded at the sound of the shot the others of the mob raised their heads in quick alarm and closed quickly around the wounded bull now the stampede began with trunks and tails raised the elephants swerved away from us i had  opportunity to get another good shot but my dutch companion was more courageous now and was keen to continue the hunt we had moved along a slope for about twto miles when i perceived by the waving of the grass that we were close to another herd they did not get our wind and i was able to creep up close the dutchman following with hesitating steps a big bull happened to be nearer than  adventure any of the others and kneeling for careful aim i fired once more for some reason my aim was bad the bull lifted his trunk in astonishment evidently hit but not much hurt then he swung around and came rushing toward us an impressive spectacle the biggest animal of the bush in rage there was something fine about his onrush but it evidently was not to the liking of the dutchman for he flung my  express rifle to the ground-a proceeding which annoyed me greatly-and took to his heels the charge of the bull straight toward me was so unexpected that i had no time for further shooting the raging beast towered above me his trunk raised like a huge club his driving tusks and small eyes which seemed to blaze with fury making a picture of violent death which is still vivid in my memory in desperation i threw myself to one side and to the ground then i began to crawl so heavy was the grass that rapid movement was impossible and after forcing myself along for a few yards on my hands and knees i lay still hardly breathing thrashing about trampling the grass waving his trunk and bellowing loudly the bull came so close that i could have hit his big legs with a stick i felt that this was my last hunt-a step or two in my direction would have brought his feet upon my body and i knew that if he should scent me it would be the end but miracles i am glad to be able to say sometimes happen the wind favored me and i wras concealed completely in the grass with a movement as sudden as his onrush the bull swung around and went crashing back toward the herd rising i pushed my way back to where i had been forced to drop my rifle in my flight on hands and knees and aiming quickly took a shot at the retreating beast hoping that this wrould cause him to swing again so that i could hit him in the head the bullet struck him in the flank but only served to hasten him on his way i now sat down to get my breath and to wipe the perspiration from my fevered brow and in a few moments i saw the round face of the dutchman peering at me cautiously through the grass needing a vent for my wrought-up feelings i promptly poured a hot volley of words into my companion for casting away my cherished rifle and taking to his heels to tell the truth however i did not blame him much he explained half humorously that he had not been able to control the motions of his legs and said that he did not believe he could have faced the charge of that elephant for a thousand pounds the big bull come so quick he exclaimed but the flush of the hunt was now upon him and with protestations that the next time he would try to stand his ground he readily agreed to follow the herd with me so we started off again and after about a mile of hard going through the thick undergrowth once more saw the elephant mob the animals were grazing on a long slope just above us a short distance to our right was a mass of tangled bushes which i knew marked a swamp we stole up slowly and quietly to get within easy gunshot of our quarry but they must have got our wind for suddenly each trunk was thrown up almost with the precision of soldiers handling arms then all together the mob stampeded and came thundering down the slope head-on toward us the bulls in advance as usual and the cows hurrying along their calves by pushing and half lifting the small elephants with their tusks only for an instant i watched the spectacle i knew that this stampede could not be stopped by bullets- there were too many elephants and they were charging too directly come on come on i shouted to the dutchman well have to run for it follow me i made for the swamp with my friend -clutching the rifle desperately this time- bringing up the rear in excellent form once he stumbled and i thought for an instant that our race was finished but he recovered himself somehow and we waded on thi grass being only about up to our armpits we could see all too vividly the advancing mob what was more important the elephants could see us and the bulls in front had their trunks suspended for blows that would knock us many feet if we could not reach the refuge of the swamp before the beasts reached us i was beginning to despair of this we had struck a rise in the ground which made our progress slower with the tangled grass about our feet it was like a flight in a nightmare when one tries to run and can not but in a moment the ground sloped down again and we made more speed the bel-lowings of the elephants had become a roar when we finally reached the marsh plunged with an elephant hunter in africa  into the mud and water and here up to our waists in ooze watched the mob go careering by not until the last extended tail had disappeared did we drag ourselves out and begin our weary tramp back to camp the cook had an excellent supper almost ready and after we had done it ample justice the gentleman from the netherlands smoking his pipe in front of the tent in the cool and quiet evening of the highland wilderness expressed an opinion to the effect that an elephant hunt was a great experience but that one was sufficient for a lifetime ill ospj after conveying my friend safely ggq back to the post of the german government at ikona i took another peep at civilization in the towns along the railroad and then looked about for a real huntsman to accompany me on an expedition for ivory for the market i found my man he was a big englishman an ex-member of the kings guards and a soldier of fortune who was ready for adventure of any kind we started from old kisumu a trading-post on the eastern shore of lake victoria nyanza our vessel was an arab dhow and our fellow passengers a choice collection of arabs east indians and swahalis all bound across the lake to hunt and trade buffeted by adverse winds we were ten days on the big inland sea of africa and the supply of provisions began to run low for the purpose of stocking up again the old arab captain cast anchor off the island of lusinga and signaled to the natives to send out canoes but for some reason the latter paid no attention driven by necessity a number of swahalis plunged off the dkoiv to swim ashore all of them reaching it in safety except the last who among the reeds uttered a frenzied shriek what this meant we knew only too well-a crocodile had seized the swimmer with a long knife in his mouth an arab jumped overboard to the rescue-a brave deed but unfortunately the rescuer was too late with our equipment wet from incessant rains we at last landed at shirati hired some sixty native carriers and pushed on without delay we passed through ikona where i had met the huntsman from the netherlands and camped some miles farther on near a wasire village which was surrounded by a high cactus hedge to keep off lions especially plentiful in this locality only for a day we tarried here pushing on in the gray light of dawn lions prowled around us doing good service in keeping our carriers close up with us and we shot a lion and a lioness obtaining two fine skins in addition my partner dropped a rhino which had caused the porters to cast down their loads and speed for the nearest mimosa trees in four days we came upon the fresh spoor of elephants-the ground almost bare of grass and the trees stripped clean of bark we camped near a pool of water to which the elephants evidently came to drink and the same morning found the herd it was divided into three mobs the biggest numbering about one hundred animals and the other two about fifty each the large mob was made up chiefly of cows and calves with only eight or ten bulls among them but these were all good tuskers the second mob were mostly young bulls with tusks weighing under fifty pounds the third detachment was composed of full-grown bulls it was the one we wanted the animals were facing us flapping their ears busily to keep off the flies and incidentally giving us a fine view of their ivory my partner and i each selected a fine bull took aim and mine dropped with a shot through the head my partner however was not so lucky he hit only the trunk the elephant gave vent to a squeal of pain and rage the others threw up their trunks with the same soldier-like precision that i had noticed when hunting with the dutchman and took flight we pursued them firing as we went and passing a young bull which was quite dead we came up with two big ones groggy from wounds dropped them and pushed on long shadows were beginning to reach eastward from the hills when we remembered that we had gone since early morning without food or water estimating the camp to be about fifteen miles behind us i proposed that we try to refresh ourselves with sleep and then look for a spring-a quest of more importance than any hunt for ivory since water was not easy to find on these semi-arid highlands and both of us had become extremely thirsty but my partner being keen to get back to camp would not listen to my suggestion after about nine miles of one of the hard-  adventure est tramps of my life we lighted a fire and threw ourselves on the ground in utter weariness i felt my tongue thickening from thirst sleep or rest being impossible i climbed a rise to obtain a view of the country in the starlight at a great distance i made out a faint glow could it be our camp descending the hill at once i roused my partner from a half stupor lighting firebrands as a safe-guard against some hungry lion or leopard that might feel inclined to leap upon us in the darkness we resumed the weary tramp for an hour or so we feared that the glow ahead was from a grass fire started by wandering savages but finally we could make out dark forms passing to and fro against the light and knew that it was our own fire and that the boys were waiting for us all the next day we lounged about the camp while our carriers brought in the ivory but the following morning we again took up the pursuit of the elephant herd for two weeks we hovered about it dropping a bull here and there and killing about twenty lions and leopards for their skins after obtaining the ivory from eighteen bull elephants and eight cows we trekked back to shirati sold the ivory to the traders and counted up our profits a statement as to these will convey an idea of the commercial side of ivory hunting the expenses must first be reckoned on the three months trip in question these were as follows the german government tax of  rupees  on each elephant shot  rupees wages of  porters at  rupees a month for three months  wages of cook at  rupees a month   wages of two gunbearers at  rupees a month  backsheesh   provisions ammunition presents to natives tax on one rhino and two buffalo at  rupees each tax on fifty antelopes at  rupees each tax on fifteen gazelles at one rupee each total the profits were ivory of  bull elephants ivory of  cows government bounty on  lions at  rupees each bounty on  leopards at  rupees each proceeds from sale of  lion-skins proceeds from sale of  leopard-skins  rupees iso    is  rupees   rupees          rupees less expense  net profit  rupees  it will be seen from this that the monetary returns from an elephant hunt of three months were not inconsiderable but such profits can be realized no more from ivory hunting in east africa within a year both the british and german governments have awakened to the danger of the extinction of the elephants within their domains and have made regulations forbidding the shooting by a single hunter of more than two elephants a year but the traveler can still see an occasional lion from the car windows on the uganda railway and leopards invade the henhouses of the farmers with immense reaches of virgin territory the country will remain for a long time to come a paradise for hunters of big game the ijcoth g mewtcaia hf puele roths under the cold heaven of the north are usually between men it is the great love of man for man which obtains born as it is out

cabin twenty miles out of dawson on the great linder-man trail they were in the queens service in the north and the year was ninety-nine these things mean much to those who know the sergeant bending over the book which lay across his knees was angry anger peered as plainly from the dark seams of his face as it showed in the curl of his close-cropped iron-gray mustache and in the song of the pen that traveled with staccato jerks across the wide page he wras a scotchman dour and curt exiled for twenty years at an obscure station among the headwaters of the mackenzie and now the terror of those who came lawless and gold-mad into alaska in the queens books at home he was john mcfer-gus but here men called him mac he was known in every mining-camp from fort selkirk to dawson and criminals when they heard his name started with instinctive fear mcfergus was surly of speech and manner but the young man as he glanced  up occasionally from his work to steal a furtive look at the others face realized for the first time how much he loved him presently the sergeant grunted and the other looking up met the boring steel of a pair of eyes so youre goin eh said mcfergus not unkindly how soon he added after a moment in a week i expect returned the other lowering his gaze the scotchmans pen resumed its song a minute passed then he continued i cant understand it charlie-no i dont seem to see it at all but i guess its because its so different with me there was a break in the usual reserve of the sergeant he seldom spoke to his subordinates at any length save to give instructions ive seen a lot of them just like you-chaps that would quit all kinds of jobs fer women but hang it charlie this is different youre in the service man in the service-the queens service --and youre with me with me mcfergus -my right-hand man i reckon theres a hundred chaps up to dawson right now whod sell their souls to the devil in a second fer the job youre throwin away an as game a lot as ever pulled a trigger mcfergus paused charlie graves said never a word once more the pen began its song and the young man studying the wrinkles in the others boot fell to musing his thoughts traveled back past his cache past lost river and thence down to jean valesques little road-house she would be waiting the girl at the road-house- jeans daughter he could see her now- the lips the eyes the hair the hands u i adventure another week and he would join her he had given his promise he had sealed the troth with a kiss women resumed mac presentlywomen and in the north at that-ye wouldnt leave the north would ye think of it man cooped up in a road-house afraid to hit the trail-you might not come back shell say therell be kids an a terrible hankering fer the trail fer the dogs fer a record run through a blizzard fer a fight curse you boy cant you see ive talked to a lot of them itll be worse for you- lots worse youve been used to it all the time-to the trail to an occasional scrap to the worst men in alaska to the drag of the snow-shoes-and then a rest a warm warm bunk an good grub a-plenty but i reckon its no use who is she good straight youre- right mac returned the young man gravely there was a noise outside the cabin the door opened it was pierre the indian runner from the fort his face was stiff with the cold he grunted stolidly as he produced a piece of crumpled paper i guess somethings the matter muttered mcfergus as he surveyed the indian kind of winded eh you must a piked some presently the sergeant gave a long-drawn whistle its from the old man he said speaking to graves red curtis has turned up hes hidin in fetzgers cabin just a piece below our cache get him alive or dead says the old man send graves the sergeant paused through his yellow teeth came a reflective oath then he went on theres a big reward up aint there along in the thousands wait theres two rewards up-one for red an one for that side-kicker of his bond again the sergeants thumb followed the lines of the note as he perused it once more and as he read he swore youre goin to quit in a week eh he went on fetzgers shanty is eighty miles up the north trail lets see you ought to be back inside of five days thatll give you two days to rest up charlie graves sat silent a half-smile played around the corners of his mouth send graves was the word from the fort it wrould be his last capture his last fight in the queens service he reflected- his last and his greatest if he succeeded his name would live long in the yukon country for on red curtiss head there long had been a price curtis wras a claim-jumper murderer renegade talked of from seattle to behring straits and demi-god in the eyes of the lawless gambling stealing killing-with his daring reenforced by luck which was the marvel of all alaska eluding the police with patient vigilance turning up in dawson when reported at bay in thief river and justice slow but quite as patient trailed him like a hound well queried mcfergus im on said graves rising graves urged his dog-team into the trail and swung along behind his sledge his face fringed with the flaps of his great parka cap wore a happy look and his thoughts speeding now onward to fetzgers cabin and now along the back trail to the little road-house and a girl mingled joy writh sorrow for this was his last assignment in the service he called to his dogs and sent the tip of his long lash stinging among them and the animals knew from the bite of the rawhide that they must make a record run the trail was well packed and hard the load on the sledge wras trifling for graves traveled with swiftness and the runners speeding over the ice-veneer of the trail gave forth a merry sound like the singing voice of a cutlass he could reach the shanty by the next evening reflecting on the past and looking forward into the future the man felt strange misgivings at conflict under his arctic shirt he fell to musing on the words of mcfergus perhaps mac was right after all perhaps his love for the girl wtould not prove stronger than his passion for the trail for active service his love had been threefold embracing mcfergus the capture of criminals and trials of endurance a year ago he would have scoffed at any other love but that was before jean val-esque had sent to the states for his daughter mcfergus had never loved nor the old man at the fort nor the rest that wras why they laughed their little quizzical angering laughs when they heard men in alaska soon forget what a woman is they see only the creatures in the concert-halls and gambling-houses of dawson-females but not feminine mac had asked with a the troth  grin if the girl were good whether she wrere straight reflected graves he had told him with an oath that she was instinct told him that she was good the instinct he had brought from the south twilight falling swiftly closed in upon the short day there was a menace in the wind that came in angry crescendo out of the north and graves drew his parka cap closer as the sting of driving snow-flakes cut his features spring was coming on he had not looked for a storm but to stop meant deeper snow in the morning and slower going-and charlie graves must travel fast the long night wore on by morning the team was staggering through great drifts making slow headway and giving little desperate wearied worn-out yelps the driver calculated that forty miles of the trail lay behind evening would see them at the cabin and then-a smile fought with the cold that numbed his features and in his heart was gladness the snow on the trail was getting deeper and the wind stung like a needle as it blew in the distance clouds of snow raced madly instinct kept the dogs in the trail and beside it snow-shrouded pines towering high and specterlike seemed to nag at the procession as it staggered onward graves fighting fatigue felt strange thoughts harassing him his mind kept wandering back to the girl jean valesques daughter in a week he would join her he panted and the small smile struggled once more with his stiffened lips came presently the face of mcfergus displacing the other and now he saw them side by side both beckoning him both calling he had been with mac for many years and knew that the old man loved him then there came another thought as he swung wearily from foot to foot he was breaking the greatest tie in all the north-the bond which ties the strong he was breaking the troth of men toward evening the wind howled out of the north like an animal but the play of the lash-tip kept trace and harness taut all day graves had fought the weariness which dragged behind knowing that if he faltered the malamoots would bolt or lie down to die in their weariness all day the vision of red curtis hovered before him-with blue-gray eyes the curl of cunning lips the arrogant chin the long red hair a handsome face graves intent on the vision forgot ache of muscle and fatigue of mind soon there came an appalling slowness of limb to answer the demands of the tyrant will the reindeer thongs of his snow-shoes cutting his swollen feet sent sharp surges of pain throbbing through them sometimes the dogs wrould fall in the deep drifts their feet painfully trapped in the harness and then the driver would stumble forward to their aid cursing them he passed the cache without stopping for food it was a race with cold and weakness all day the fear of losing urged him on relentless pains bored his feet and lash-arm and latterly there came a mind-weariness that was far worse than pain of body at last graves eye discerned a black speck far off across the white and slowly the speck grew blurring intermittently as snow-clouds swept the landscape it was fetzgers cabin there was a sudden marshaling of strength and graves forgetful of weariness was glad with the prospect of battle graves swore when he stopped at the door of the cabin his oath was fervent thanksgiving prayerful coming from the heart the words came slowly came with a strange snarl half human half bestial through closed teeth and running slaver the man-flame in graves was flickering low men in alaska are not always human when the trail is long they become beasts the door of the shanty swung open without noise at graves touch it was almost dark and graves fumbling for a match shivered with the fear that red curtis might be gone the match sputtered and then flamed bright a man lay on the bunk sleeping he stood for a second hesitating regarding him in the dim light-the murderer the renegade the prey of justice but the under dog graves was conscious of the combat within him as though he were watching it from a distance it was a conflict between beast and man only a second and he was resolved curtis he cried sharply there was a movement on the bunk a break in the slow rhythm of the breathing curtis he called again and added after a pause its graves-of the queens service the eyes opened and fell upon the face of  adventure graves just as the match flickering in a draft from the door went out but curtis had seen the face and recognized it graves standing in the darkness heard a muffled cry unhuman like the noise of an animal neither man could see but the lust of battle calls upon instinct in places where vision fails and as the man leaped from the bunk graves sprang forward to meet him there wtas the clutch of straining hands the gasp of quick intakes of breath the stamp of pawing feet upon the floor and then the snap of steel as the handcuffs closed with a click over the wrists and now graves collapsed in a faint across the renegade for even the beast-flame was flickering low again and again he tried to rise and to ward off the kicks of his handcuffed prisoner at length the flame flared brighter staggering to his feet charlie graves of the queens service struck a match and then wtith sheer tyranny of will forced his tired hands to bind the prisoner with strips of raw-hide it was daylight when graves fcsggj opened his eyes consciousness of  bodily pain and soreness of joints brought recollection and his eyes sought the figure on the floor curtis was gazing at him out of strange frightened bloodshot eyes at length words came faltering through bloodless lips i guess ive got it graves he began writh a little laugh the other understood and bending over the shaking figure raised the lips the gums were livid with great swollen blotches fringing the teeth my god he exclaimed scurvy eh queried red curtis i reckon it is all right returned the other quietly felt it cornin on said curtis pains in the back an legs-kind of all in fer about a week thats why i couldnt mix it up - when the-was it last night no the night before say got any potatoes or lemons nothing but dried salmon returned graves the sergeants shanty is eighty miles back he added never mind said the other its gone too far anyhow i guess red curtis has led you fellers your last chase but say graves i was a heller while i lasted wasnt i what did they think about me back there graves was silent there was something in the claim-jumpers coolness that compelled admiration after a while he returned  alive or dead was the word the gray eyes of the dying man were fixed hungrily on the others lips as they shaped themselves for the words while the look of old-time hauteur dominated the pinched features there was another pause longer than before presently curtis spoke say graves you wont leave me here to die all alone will you its been a holy fright the last week i was glad you came-glad you wont go away will you charlie charlie graves of the queens service started a strange look had glimmered forth from the gray eyes and the inner pattern of the famous criminal which the other was busy piecing out underwent rapid changes he looked away queer emotions checked him he sat repeating the words you wont go away will you charlie-repeating them slowly hardly comprehending it took a long while for their meaning to become patent all the while the sunken eyes were fixed on him he knew but he dared not meet them the girl came into graves mind-the girl back at jean valesques road-house she would be waiting for him the time was near he had promised had given his troth had sealed it with a kiss he thought of old valesque and of mac mac would be waiting in all these years his right-hand man had never failed him had never failed to return to the cabin at the appointed time and besides there was little salmon left in the canvas bag and the cache wras twenty miles away red curtis might die in an hour to-day to-morrow-but again he might linger for a week men with scurvy die like cats graves knew he had kept death-vigils before and the promise-the troth no-he could not stay but this wras curtis-red curtis this was different surely he would die soon-to-day perhaps curtis he mused red curtis murderer claim-jumper renegade the greatest in all alaska matchless presently graves muttered i reckon i can stick around red old man then began a lonesome vigil beside the dying man graves placed him upon the bunk on one side of the shanty and sat gazing at the wall of the cabin a day passed another dragged itself slowly by two of the troth  the malamoots were dead and graves cut the rest out of harness and told them to mush in ten hours they would reach mc-ferguss cabin graves could not see them die and there was not enough grub for them and him the dogs bolted up the back trail and graves returned to the death-watch sometimes looking up he would catch the eyes of the other the two seldom spoke men are silent when they wait for death graves nibbled sparingly at the thin strips of salmon that remained calculating how long they and the man on the bunk would last sometimes the man with the scurvy would wander off into delirium laughing wildly talking of fights and poker-games and women then would come a iucid interval and now these last were far apart when they came he would ask the watcher if he were there begging him not to go away graves almost famished maddened by the talk of the dying man and by the eyes that stared and stared felt his own mind wander days passed dragging themselves out slowly to interminable length until he lost all count of them and still the man on the bunk lived and talked and laughed and stared now he could stay no longer graves often told himself for the girl was waiting and then curtis would beg him with tears and trembling not to leave him and he stayed as graves sat cowering in a corner of the cabin he thought and thought it came back to him-the face of the sergeant the look in his eyes when he told him he was going to quit the service and then curtis would laugh deliriously from the bunk and the keeper of the long vigil prayed that he would die and cursed him for living once there came a day when curtis talked for hours of dawson city with its poker its faro its whisky its women he raved about a girl fondling the air with ghastly words of affection words that came uncertain and muffled from black lips words that made graves blood run cold he called her by name and tears rolled down his cheeks as he called graves leaned forward listening intently but the delirious words were only half-formed and though he bent over the dying figure until his ear almost touched the lips he listened vainly sometimes curtis would raise himself on his elbow gesticulate wildly and demand her picture and graves himself half delir- ious and frightened into momentary consciousness by the unearthly yells and eyes shivering with a great fear could only stare in frightened fascination while the other fumbled at the wall of the cabin a new light came at length into the eyes of the criminal and graves knew that this day would be his last he beckoned graves to his side while whispered words dribbled weakly from his wasted lips a thin hand stole falteringly across the front of his heavy winter shirt its here its here he muttered faintly after a while the hand drew out of the bosom a little cardboard the lips moved but there was no sound for death had come graves peered at the picture on the cardboard trembling as he looked he knew the eyes the lips the hair it was the girl at jean valesques road-house a mighty surge of pain gathering at graves heart swept his frame and sang through his half-closed teeth like a tempest seizing the picture he crushed it between his fingers my god my god he moaned and out of his eyes burned slowly the hottest of tears i told mac she wras straight-told him she wras good he remembered now how mac and the rest had smiled whenever he had spoken of her swiftly knotting the thongs of his snow-shoes he swung into the back trail while the sun casting a cold glamour upon the snows chilled him like a poison two men one tossing in half delirium and the other treading very softly whenever he had to cross the room were listening to the patient tick of the little clock on the shelf so it had been for many days sometimes the sergeant would gaze long and anxiously while dream-images indexed themselves on the white face often too the figure would try vainly to raise itself and would break into unintelligible combinations of words latterly this had happened at much longer intervals until one day when charlie graves opened his eyes the strange look was gone hello mac came to the hungry ears of the old scotchman charlie he returned laying his great hand on the others what day is it friday  then you found me yesterday   adventure two weeks ago yesterday returned the sergeant after it was time for you to blow back i hiked down the trail every day tryin to spot you the seventh day i stumbled across you stickin out of a drift i reckoned for a while that youd sure pass em in a feller came past yesterday an brought word about red i guess the rewards yours all right  a smile hovered faintly on graves lips but left them suddenly when the sergeant went on youve got to get well quick now old valesques girl is waitin fer you the sergeant paused not noting the others change of expression after a moment he resumed an i want to take back the things i said about her it was pretty low-down of me i made some wild guesses when i said em an i hadnt ought to done it but i hated to lose ye i learned different later on shes the gamest there is but wait till i tell you while you was hikin down to fetzgers shack on a hunt fer red who should turn up in these parts but his side-kicker bob bond he stopped for a snack back there at the road-house old man valesque had run up to dawson an the girl was there alone she knew him in a second the young devil tried to love her up and the girl springs a game that wins me over in a second she jerked out a gun an with the powder-devil starin straight at bond she asks him to turn his back to her or get bit bond was wise an done as he was told in a second she has her snow-shoes on now she says you mush an never mind rubberin around im here all right coinin right along if you try to turn your noodle this way the sbootin-iron talks forward hike late that night they landed here her an bond the next day the runner from the fort blowed in an took brother bond along theres a thousand bones in it for your girl during mcferguss recital charlie graves lay silent with stoic cast of countenance mcfergus had calculated that his story would set the young man on fire he had been treasuring it impatiently until this day well the sergeant demanded puzzled and disappointed aint you satisfied eh what do you want anyhow i tell you shes the gamest there is-you can take that for a tip if you marry her you wont have to quit the service man and still the young man was silent the picture he had destroyed confronted him also he could hear the delirious love-phrases as they fell weakly from the lips of red curtis then did she say anything -the girl  say anything returned the scotchman what could she say i jollied her right about a sartain young officer in the queens service an she blushed real pretty she was mighty tickled about the way she got bond-said youd be awful glad dont you tumble she did it for you-for you sabe  did she say so questioned the man on the bunk say so roared the sergeant do i have to have an iceberg fall my way with the exception of a little personal grudge she owred the bond-curtis combination it was for you-to show you she was a game one like the married wife of a queens service man ought to be did she know curtis demanded graves the infernal red-head stopped at the old mans road-house a year ago an claim-jumped a picture of hers that was settin on a shelf it got her hot it was the only one she had ffujs the clock in the cabin had ticked ilmsii out a day three days a week graves had recovered rapidly hearing all day in fancy the ripple of a girls laughter and the quiet crooning of a voice at night he saw the lines and curves and colors of her face and all the while his heart beat loudly and now the clock ticking impatiently had measured the lapse of a fortnight as charlie graves stood knotting the thongs of his snow-shoes mcfergus stood silently by youve made the luckiest strike in all alasky said the old man an you wont have to quit the service either he added graves strode out into the snows he was keeping his double troth and his path lay toward the light that hung shimmering in the south inthe noon the moon u horace hazeltine half hidden in the dusky shadows of the great rooms farthest corner the tall lean white-haired old gentleman stooping swung feebly flush the heavy metal door of the small fire-proof safe and secured it by a twirl of its nickeled knob the bent shrunken figure in the shabby leather armchair before the fireplace disregarded and unheeded watched him furtively he had come of late old peter hemming eldest survivor of a long line of honorable but parsimonious connecticut landowners to ignore his imbecile brother in many matters for henrys mental weakness had developed within recent years into a derangement and his always meager understanding had grown seriously warped peter saw no reason therefore why this evenings transfer of jeweled family heirlooms precious plate and hoarded currency from the ancient brass-bound padlocked chest to the new repository of combination-guarded steel should hold for that clouded twisted mind the smallest measure of interest much more likely indeed to arouse those dull wits from their lethargic contemplation of the dimly glowing coals before which it was henrys habit to sit hour after hour were the tidings peter now conveyed as coming forward he paused at his brothers side its snowing-snowing hard i say its snowing-snowing hard the head of the seated old man bald of crown and parchment-yellow like his vacant wrinkled face swayed slowly back and forth in signal that he understood the iterated sentences and the moons at the full he croaked in return iterating too the moons at the full in the earlier stages of his dementia henry hemming had been inclined to craft at these seasons there was more than one ugly waif word afloat among the neighbors which had to do with his acts of cunning at such times but in recent years the moons had waxed and waned without exerting any perceptible ill influence upon the crippled intellect yet he never failed to note the passing of this lunar phase its a march blizzard peter told him its been raging since three oclock and the drifts are already high if it keeps on the roads will be impassable before morning he repeated each sentence and his brothers old head swayed again understandingly the moons at the full he said once   adventure more this time he added and its cold dead cold peter agreed with him his own fingers were numb the room was very chill he pulled an old-fashioned bell-cord and presently just as he had seated himself in the leathern chair opposite his brothers turned up the lamp adjusted his spectacles and spread out the newspaper that had come in the evening mail-just too as the antique hall clock in the passage in solemn tone tolled the hour of nine a hunchbacked servitor old like his masters appeared in the doorway the house is a tomb abijah said peter a little querulously put more coal in the furnace and open the drafts the night is bitter then for a half-hour and more the long somber room was silent save for the ceaseless whirl of the snow against the window-panes the intermittent protest of the wind-lashed sashes and the occasional rustle of the newspaper as peter hemming turned its pages henry meanwhile his faded eyes dim as the dying coals on wrhich they rested sat crouching dumb and motionless like a carven gnome it was the habit of the brothers to rise as the clock struck ten and mount the winding low-treaded colonial stairway to their second-floor bedchambers night after night the practise was invariable until the signal was given peter read his paper without comment and henry never moved never spoke but to-night to the astonishment of the elder of the two men the crouching figure across the hearth stirred before the clock-stroke stirred indeed fully twenty minutes in advance of the accustomed hour for stirring and stirred in a quite unusual and alarming manner it was the sharpness of the sound made by his withered hands dropping with sudden clutch upon his chair-arms that drew peters eyes from the printed column he had been engrossed in and caused him precipitately to drop his paper into his lap henry was sitting up very straight straighter of back indeed than peter remembered ever to have seen him yet with his naked yellowish head perkingly slanted and listeningly alert his eyes wontedly expressionless seemed strangely enough to have taken on an undreamed-of luster and as the startled brother stared the cup of his amazement was brimmed to overflowing by a sharply penetrating hissing sort of whisper listen its the wind said peter soothingly though his heart fluttered its the wind he had heard nothing else but henry irritably shook his head listeni he hissed again and peter holding his breath strained his ears to him the stillness now seemed abysmal the wind had passed the snow no longer smote the panes theyre at the door henry cried suddenly springing from his chair keep em out keep em out and he shuffled into the shadows of the rooms end to peter it was but another distressing racking and unlooked for turn of the life-old infirmity the moon as he had been reminded was at the full he rose sadly and started to follow it must be his mission now to pacify all his years it seemed to him had been given up to ministering to this feeble-minded one he moved totteringly nervously unbraced only to stumble the next instant to a halt checked by the sudden clangor of the door-bell echoing brazenly through the silent house in panic he laid a shaking hand on the back of henrys vacated chair and paused there white and apprehensive while abijahs old feet scraped across the hall-while the chain-bolt rattled and the great lock clicked to the turning key the invading rush of icy air seemed to freeze his thin blood a shiver ran through him as vainly he strove to gather the sense of the ensuing dialogue which penetrated to him in a vague jumble at length still disturbed still perplexed he heard the door slammed against the blast and then-approaching footsteps instinctively he peered once more with apprehension into the gloom of the rooms end henry dumbly cowering there beside the safe was half lost amid the shadows and peter tense though he was with questioning suspense sighed his scant measure of relief at the same instant abijah with some apology of manner reluctantly admitted two fur-wrapped snow-encrusted figures- a man and a woman who clung dependently to his arm the man had removed his cap revealing sandy hair and a florid tempest-whipped face the woman was thickly veiled and to the veil there still clung splotches of snow or the frost of her frozen breath in the noon of the moon  peter recovering his self-command with the revelation of their presence took a step forward his attitude courtly yet reserved inquisitorial i hope you wont think this an imposition it wtas the woman who spoke first her voice was low and there was an elusive suggestion of the foreigner in her accent  but i must have shelter i am ill and-  she paused as if for breath and the man took up the appeal the motors stalled sir he was evidently her chauffeur  weve been limping through drifts the past two hours and--- im quite willing to pay you anything the woman broke in your servant seemed disinclined--- the interruption came this time from the old gentleman i do not keep a public house he said a little proudly  i do not entr -tain strangers my servant understands chat but in all humanity sir wta vr plea her hand busy now in an effort to raiie her veil i am an ill woman humanity repeated peter hemming in tone less austere is another matter you spoke of payment he turned to the man and you he asked i can go on was the reply theres nothing the matter with me but you see mrs-the ladys all in sir ill come back and fetch her in the morning when the roads is broken the snows about stopped already very well then it was at once a signal of consent and of dismissal he was in haste to conclude the interview nervous as he had been all the while lest that cowering imbecile in the corner should humiliate him by sudden word or action to abijah who had stood waiting he made a gesture and the old servitor understanding plucked at the sleeve of the chauffeurs fur coat for the woman peter pushed forward a chair be seated madam he said but before obeying she turned to her companion my satchel frederick she reminded him while abijah and the chauffeur were out of the room on her errand and just as having loosened her veil and turned it partially back over her motoring hood she exposed a somewhat sallow but nevertheless strikingly handsome face of the brunette type there occurred an incident which set poor peter hemmings old heart to rapid uneven nervous pumping for turning uneasily to enquire again as to henrys whereabouts and conduct he was startled to discover that he had crept stealthily forward and was standing just behind him standing there a dwarfish horrid little figure his wizened face evilly distorted his eyes still abnormally bright he was peering with sinister intentness upon the strange visitor it was evident however that still busy with her veil she had not yet observed him and peter in desperate hope of distracting him ventured upon a shrilly whispered command to return to his chair but the wrhisper not only failed of effect on henry who still stared immovable but served to attract the attention of the woman her gaze lifted and met that of her observer and for just a moment peter indulged a compensating hope that alarmed by the spectacle she might even yet decline the hospitality she had so craved and which he had so grudgingly granted to his surprise however she evinced no sign of uneasiness she seemed indeed scarcely interested and the old gentleman with some reluctance accorded her a meed of admiration for what seemed to him a superb exhibition of self-control he thought of this afterward when abijah had shown her to the seldom occupied ground-floor guest-chamber across the hall when the lights were out for the night and the house quiet and henry having at length been calmed was snug in bed in the room adjoining his own he thought of it as he lay wakeful in his great four-poster and reviewed the evenings episode it came to him as an odd sequel to henrys singular prescience and subsequent agitation he wondered who the woman was remembering now that she had given no name indeed she had volunteered no information whatever save that she was ill and required shelter whence she came or whither she was going had not been so much as hinted and he had not even thought of inquiring the experience distressed and disquieted him his old brain teemed with a score of conjectures which contended with sleep once he fancied that he heard henry moving in the next room later an echo seemed to reach him from the floor below finally  adventure in dread he rose lighted a candle and went into his brothers chamber but henry was sleeping soundly ii the four men were grouped before the guest-chamber door in the dim gray of the lower hall peter and henry hemming abijah and the chauffeur the nights snow-storm had been succeeded by a steady pelting rainfall the morning was chill and dismal through the panes of the hall transom a pale murky half-light filtered suppose you knock again peter suggested and the chauffeur with some impatience rapped hard and resoundingly a fusillade of blows there was no response  thats the fifth or sixth time the young man declared she cant be there no peter agreed  she cant be there and yet she would scarcely attempt i suppose to face this storm afoot especially since she was expecting you abijah was silent he seemed only half awake the truth was he had been aroused from profound slumber by the chauffeurs noisy ringing of the door-bell henry standing a little back wagged his parchment-like poll and grinned vacantly suppose you try the door peter ventured the chauffeur promptly seized the knob and turned it but the door held  its locked he said but even as he said it he turned sharply with an expression that seemed half alarm half anger and added and locked on the outside the keys here in the lock old peter hemming caught his breath he felt his heart falter and then sink what was that sound he had heard down here in the night why had he thought he heard henry moving about his room just a little while before then unlock it he ordered boldly enough and felt his brothers leering eyes upon his back the door swung inward and peter forgetful of his customary reserve and dignity bent eagerly forward for searching sweep of the revealed interior the bed tossed and in disarray was empty the room was as tenantless as the bed you see cried the chauffeur turning about a demand in his tone you see it was as though he said where is she it is very odd peter returned and abijah looking too and seeing though he said nothing appeared immeasurably perplexed henry did not look indeed he retreated a step and leaned against the newel-post at the stair-foot chuckling low but malignly she couldnt have left the house the chauffeur pursued she wouldnt in this storm i know she wouldnt why should she he stood with his cap on his hands plunged deeply in the pockets of his fur coat his manner had lost its last vestige of deference his attitude was dictatorial perturbed tremulous with apprehension though he was old peter hemming resented the fellows demeanor and all at once his wrinkled lips hardened to a line over his set teeth and his old eyes kindled why should she indeed he snapped why should she without so much as a word of thanks for the shelter my house afforded her that is the question i myself want answered his miser thought had turned suddenly to his possessions he was recalling how he had admitted a total stranger under his roof presumably the stranger was a woman certainly all the indications had pointed to this presumption and yet had they all so pointed most women-indeed who not but the most exceptionally strong-nerved -would have quailed before that hideously satanic stare of henrys but this woman had seen it unmoved might it not have been therefore that this fur-wrapped hooded veiled creature was after all a man -a man of lawless vocation a thief a safe-breaker at the moment the one convincing argument against such a theory-the fact that her chauffeur had returned and was even now demanding information concerning his mistresss whereabouts-was submerged in peters panic of mistrust concerning his hoarded treasures come he demanded clutching the fellows fur sleeve come with me and perhaps we shall see why she or he or whatever it was you brought here sneaked away before the house was astir the young man made no demur he allowed himself to be led across the hall and in the noon of the moon  into the long darksome sitting-room with its heavy ancient furniture its thick faded hangings the coal fire had long ago died out the grate held only gray clinkers and white ashes henry followed more slowly at a distance but abijah with the instinct of the worker went into the guest-chamber later after he had prepared the old mens breakfast he would have to put this room to rights in the middle of the sitting-room floor old peter hemmings hold on the chauffeurs sleeve suddenly relaxed his eager stride ceased gasping he stood still his lips and hollow cheeks white as his snowy hair the door of the new fireproof safe was wide open the polished steel of its lining reflecting the pale light which fell upon it from the near window the floor about it was strewn wtith tarnished silver forks and spoons and other pieces of plate and amid this litter were scattered leather silk-lined jewel-cases open for the most part and empty you see you see he cried at length tremulously his poise but half recovered  it is as i feared the person you brought here was a thief and he laid agitated hands on the young man beside him but the young man shook him off with scarcely an effort let go of me he commanded smiling cynically youre crazy thats what you are why shed no more think of doing that sort of thing than the pope himself would shes got more money and jewels than she knows what to do with youve been robbed my friend but mrs-thats to say the lady i fetched here didnt do it your house has been broken into burglars thats it they frightened her and shes still hiding somewhere in the garret maybe or in the cellar peter listened dazed confused out of the welter of his thoughts at length emerged a question that spurred him to instant action had the thief found the secret drawer -the drawer containing the hoarded currency the thousand-dollar treasury notes forty-three of them another moment and he was on his knees before the open safe his nervous forefinger pressing a spring at the pressure a steel slide receded and an oblong steel panel came into view in its center was a countersunk steel ring palpitantly every nerve tense  he slipped his finger within it-drew out the drawer the bills were there as he deftly restored the aperture to its original masquerade he breathed quickly the jewels could probably be recovered little if any of the silver so far as he could see had been taken he wondered why and wondering he rose the chauffeur was still standing in the rooms center his head bent thoughtfully forward and behind him creeping stealthily upon him his face hideous with murderous craft in his upraised hand an iron grate-bar was henry peter hemming weighted by three score and ten years and further hampered by a whirling succession of emotions to which he was unaccustomed found now in his emergency that he was utterly voiceless found too that he had lost the last ounce of power from his flaccid muscles and so stood gazing in a torturing agony of waiting unable to warn unable to move in the eternity of the ensuing second he could only pray with all the fervor of his spirit that to the man in danger might come even yet a saving impulse and even as the madman was upon him this prayer was answered the chauffeur discovering a gold trinket on the floor almost at his feet all at once stooped down to recover it and the blow aimed with crushing intent at his head fell with deflected and diminished force on his bent back in the struggle which ensued henry hemming although evincing a strength and agility quite marvelous considering his years was easily overpowered his adversary throwing him finally unarmed weak and panting into the depths of his own worn leather chair before the hearth there peter now restored distressed lest liis brother should have been harmed came to him and bending solicitously over him murmured soothingly as might a mother to a hurt child  poor boy poor boy  he crooned comfortingly you are not hurt lad are you tell me do you hear you are not hurt tell me you are not hurt he took one of the imbeciles thin knob-knuckled hands in his own and began to stroke it while the chauffeur smiled sneer-ingly and muttered as he balanced the heavy grate-bar of which he had disarmed him  adventure why-why exclaimed the ministering brother in pained surprise whats this he is hurt his hand is hurt here on the inside theres blood on it poor boy but at that moment there was an almost simultaneous discovery on the part of the chauffeur whose eyes were bent scrutiniz-ingly on the grate-bar that he held good god he cried whats this theres blood here-clotted blood and theres hair too the tall old man rose in dumb alarm and then there entered trembling from the hall the hunchbacked abijah his mouth was open he was staring with wide frightened eyes and holding in his arms as he might have held a baby a white-cased pillow peter saw him first but the younger man quick now to suspect the slightest sound turned too almost instantly mr peter mr peter  the old servitor was stammering look at this mrpeter on the pillow case was a great uneven dark red stain murdered the voice of the chauffeur echoed through the great room murdered and by that fiend  with shaking hand he pointed to the demented henry crouching silent unheeding in the chair by the hearth its her bood on the pillow its her blood and her hair on this old peter hemming swayed backward caught himself and stumbled gropingly for his chair opposite henrys into which he relaxed with a wailing cry he covered his wrinkled face with his wrinkled hands and broke into violent sobbing his tears trickling between his long bony fingers in his struggle with the lunatic the chauffeurs cap had been dislodged and his dark sandy hair set awry now by his own excitedly tormenting hands stood bristling ill show you he raged ill show the lot of you dont you think i cant see that pretended safe-robbery was a blind you had it all fixed thats why i was brought in here i was to be interested so that crazy man could come upon me from behind and brain me but i was too smart for him his hand went to the pocket of his great fur coat and heres something else a locket i found on the floor-her locket some one of you dropped it here in this room murdered and robbed i know i know what a fortune in jewels she had on her when she came here where are they this was the least valuable of the lot he looked about for his cap and found it when he had put it on he turned to abijah who was still standing where he had stopped the pillow dropped to the floor beside him im not sure about you he said sternly i dont believe though that you are in it if you were you wouldnt have brought in that evidence and with a motion of his foot he indicated the pillow im going to trust you anyhow im going to leave these two women-killers in your charge and if you want things to go well with you just be sure not to let em get away im off to stamford now for the police maybe you can find out while im gone where theyve hidden my employers body noisily he stamped towards the door but at the threshold the voice of old peter hemming who all the while up until now had not stirred arrested him stop he cried as hastily he rose from his chair  stop i must speak with you  the old gentlemans eyes were red from weeping and his voice shook with the stress of his emotion the sturdy figure of the excited chauffeur halted and turned quickly  well  he demanded  what have you to say now  nothing here peter answered his tone was abject i wish to speak to you alone i want you to come into the diningroom for a moment sullenly the young man gestured a reluctant consent maybe its a trap he muttered but im not scared of fossils ill risk it in the scantily-furnished wainscoted room to which peter led him he took a place with his back to the wall declining a proffered chair the master of the house stood too one hand resting on the oak table black with age before you go peter began after nervously clearing his throat i have one request to make of you and after that perhaps one plea i can not but admit that appearances-the circumstances indeed- are terribly in favor of your contention but you must concede that until the body is found or some more conclusive evidence of this womans death is adduced we should still have the benefit of the doubt my request is therefore that you accompany me now in a thorough search of the house again the chauffeur sullenly acquiesced in the noon of the moon  i meant to have a look in that room she slept in anyhow he said but when they came to inspect that they found little to aid in a determination the blood-stained pillow seemed to have been the only damning exhibit her clothes were gone every scintilla of her belongings was gone from the traveling-bag she was so particular to have had fetched even to her hairpins and her chauffeur seemed disappointed that foxy servant of yours has done this he growled hes cleaned out the place his guide made no denial he led him to a store-room or large closet which adjoined but the inspection here was no more fruitful the kitchen likewise produced at first no clew-not indeed until the young man on his own initiative approached the cellar door with the intention of descending then chancing to look down he made a discovery on the bare boards was a sanguinary splotch as large as a quarter of a dollar  see  he cried with all the feverish turbulence of a hound that has found ascent see it is down here she was carried and impetuously he rushed down the cellar stairs when peter following perforce more slowly reached the stair-foot conviction was there to meet him the chauffeur was holding a lighted match over a long fresh-turned pile of earth in one of the stone-arched alcoves besides it earth-stained lay the coal-shovel as added testimony to the recentness of the work just what quickly followed in the way of added evidence-how from one corner and another this brawny red-haired nemesis brought forth damning irrefutable dumb testimony old peter hemming never specifically remembered but from a horrid complexity of impressions a blackened bone dragged from amid the cinders of the stone-cold furnace and a strand of hair gore-matted plucked from an ash-bin loomed grimly foremost in his brief after-memory during the unspeakable moments of this condemnatory unfolding while staring in dazed horror his wits had yet been busily conjuring means to save the poor demented perpetrator whom he loved and for whose fate he trembled for his brothers life of course he had no fear his insanity would protect that but he dreaded for him that incarceration worse even it seemed to him than death which exposure of the crime would unquestionably involve and he dreaded too though in secondary place the smirch on the family name yet how were these consequences to be evaded  two courses alone presented themselves and one seemed as difficult of accomplishment as the other this solitary witness must be quieted either by bribery or by death as for abijah he felt no concern in his keeping any secret of the hemmings was inviolate p by the time the chauffeur had exhausted his production of evidence peter had made up his mind he would offer to bay the fellows silence if he failed in this then with the dread alternative he must succeed when they reascended the stairs abijah was in the kitchen perfunctorily preparing breakfast the tragedy had scarcely scratched the surface of his aged stolidity and in the sitting-room to which peter haggard wan pallid as a cadaver now led the way with dragging steps henry monster in miniature slept crumpled in his chair the elder brother in passing bent his eyes upon him for a full second not in horror nor repulsion not even in reprobation but with an expression of all-excusing all-forgiving love and ineffable pity in the far corner opposite the depleted fireproof safe was an antique mahogany secretary and on the straight-backed chair before it peter sank as one wofully weary and as the chauffeur now rid of his heavy fur coat which he had removed the better to prosecute his work in the cellar took the seat he indicated opposite him the old gentleman listlessly as if from sheer nervousness drew partially open a drawer at his right hand at the same moment his eyes roved to the open safe and catching sight for the first time of the bolts protruding from the edge of the heavy steel door he realized that last night in the dusk he could not have fully closed it before throwing off the combination and then there came to him a mental picture of his mad brother his brain in-iquitously distorted by that strange influence of the moon at its noon prowling here in the night betwixt theft and murder murder and theft he even wondered in that second where henry could have hidden the jewels wondered if he could have buried them with parts of the womans corpse and  o adventure decided that in such an event since nothing in the world would ever induce him to disturb that mound in the alcove that they were gone beyond recovery the moment of silence between the two seated men was as though peter who had craved the interview had either not quite gathered what he wished to say or was at a loss for breath with which to say it when however eventually he spoke it was without preliminaries headlong he plunged into his proposal i must buy you off he said bluntly the authorities must not be informed you are not a rich man i will make you rich and i will trust you the fellows face as red now almost from excitement as it had been the night before from cold took on a cynical smile dont you wish you could he sneered i can and i will the old gentleman persisted ill give you anything in reason to save my poor brother from the madhouse and yourself from the chair the other added with the same smile i have no fear for myself well ive a lot of fear for myself said the chauffeur fiankly enough im responsible for that lady your brother put an end to how far do you suppose id get before theyd be after me to explain what became of her  you can-you must get away peter hemming urged vehemently its worth it man it means a fortune for you a life without any more work think of that  oh im thinking all right was the response but i dont see it im not taking any chances for a few measly thousand dollars besides whats the use she and id be traced here and- my denial that you were ever in the house would be enough my denial that you ever asked shelter here-that we ever heard of your mistress or you i am honored and respected in this state no one would doubt my word the chauffeur silently shook his head in dissent come pleaded peter let me give you- and as his hand went tremblingly into the open drawer of the secretary he watched with tense scrutiny the other mans florid face watched with a prayer that he might after all yield with a dread lest he should voice a final refusal it was a long an interminable moment then from the chauffeur came the question what do you call a fortune and peter hemmings sigh was audible his hand came from the drawer empty twenty thousand dollars he said quickly again the red head turned from side to side twenty-five thousand too little but the refusal lacked emphasis thirty thousand in the chauffeurs eyes the light of cupidity began to burn thirty thousand in cashl the old gentleman emphasized he was straining forward his breath was coming quick make it forty and- youll say yes he gasped it it was a tense whisper scarcely audible ill say yes forty thousand the drawer of the secretary closed with a snap of the loaded revolver it contained peter hemming now had no need ill a brief pause ensued of eminent relief for both then the old man rising turned totteringly toward the safe but before he reached it the sharp jingle of approaching sleigh-bells checked him in apprehension and he stood alertly listening with lips parted the younger man hearing the sound rose too and when after having waxed louder it suddenly ceased and was succeeded by the doorbells echoing clangor he reached impulsively for his coat and his face went a shade less florid come now he urged hoarsely i cant wait all day it wont do for me to be seen here you know its probably only a tradesman said peter reassuringly i suppose the back door is closed by the snow-drifts as he stooped to the safe he heard abijah shuffling through the uncarpeted hall his finger was on the secret spring when the creak of the opening house door held him for another second inert held him indeed until loud and insistent voices reaching his ears startled him upright again in swift alarm briskly with short hurrying steps he traversed the room to meet insolent invasion on the threshold for the two burly intruders in rain-soaked garments ignoring in the noon of the moon i his questioning presence bent their searching gaze over his shoulders to where poor henry slumbered in his chair to where with back turned the chauffeur crouched in the shadow of the ancient mahogany secretary having recognized in one of the two the town constable seamed of visage and tawny mustached peter was swept by an unreasoning accession of fear that in some way which he did not stop to question tidings of his brothers crime had got abroad he could now entertain no doubt his effort to save him by financial sacrifice had proved futile at the very moment of fancied success but there was still an alternative henry must be spared at all hazards gentlemen he cried in desperation gentlemen i am at your service i confess fully and freely i-i alone-am responsible the constable turned to him but the other taller and less corpulent paying no heed strode by him responsible echoed the constable responsible for what mr hemming a nervous venerable hand fell agitatedly upon his wet coat-sleeve for the death of the woman the old voice faltered my brother knew nothing of it i assure you he didnt perplexity and pity were mixed in the officers expression he was slow-minded and he had had a stirring morning yonders the fellow were--- he began  but the sentence trailed as he sprang forward to the assistance of his partner who was grappling with the chauffeur for possession of a promptly drawn revolver at these odds the scuffle was brief and peter confused and scarcely believing saw the handcuffs slipped on the fellows wrists i guess he wont make no more trouble for a while the constable volunteered as he readjusted his overcoat itll be ten years or more for him and his woman peter hemming shivered it was evident to him now that the womans murder was still his secret the constable had not understood he wondered why they were arresting the man he supposed they must both have been fleeing from justice when they were overtaken by the snow-storm we got the jewelry mr hemming the constable continued and if youll come up to the court house any time to-day well- the old gentleman stared at him dumbly it was the other officer who interrupted we want you to make an affidavit too he added i suppose it was the old game they worked two years ago in indiana and then you can identify the woman as well the woman gasped peter sure the woman returned the constable come here and ill show you something he led him to a front window wthich overlooked the snow-piled driveway before the house a two-seated sleigh waited in the rain before the door on the front seat was the driver and beside him a female figure wrapped in furs as peter gazed the latter turned her head impatiently towards the house and the old white-haired man cried out in excess of emotion hell identify her all right said the constable to the other as he supported his shaking charge to a chair and then leaning over he explained  clever crooks these two mr hemming the mans one of the smartest safe-crackers in the country and the womans a cracker-jack on fixin up a plant out in indiana they say she did it with such things as false hair beef-blood and veal-bones peters eyes traveled to where his demented brother with chin on chest was still wrapped in peaceful slumber and as he nodded to the constable in token of understanding his wrinkled face lighted with a smile of thanksgiving the mahogany garden hp frank stanton jr chapter i a knife in the dark oaskell bent his head not an instant too soon not a second too late the steel blade of the hen-equen sword swept a whistling arc above him and the heavy hooked tip missed his neck an inch-perhaps two inches his fingers itched to twitch the blue-barreled magazine revolver away from his hip and end this thing twice now within ten minutes some one had stooped down from the stone gallery around the patio and tried to snip his head from his shoulders and though the soft swish of the blade spoke a malice and wickedness that sprang from some most murderous purpose haskell had not the remotest conjecture to offer as to why any one should wish to loll him a stranger in this strange land a month before he had left the mining camps and gone to denver for his vacation only to be handed a telegram from the sen- ior member of the great engineering firm with which he had been under contract since he had left yale a firm that guided all the mining operations devised all the irrigation and lumbering systems and surveyed and superintended all the railroad tramway power-plant dock and warehouse construction for a powerful wall street group with money to invest anywhere in the world that one dollar would make another the telegram had been brief but specific robert haskell hotel oxford denver col mclrnery down with typhoidgo via mexico city vera cruz to progresso yucatan then inland to hacienda of calderon y ortegas family beyond valladolid instructions going by ward line mail john r peters that was all that was enough he had caught the evening train for the land beyond the rio grande and save for the days lost by missing the boat at vera cruz he had traveled with the haste of a kings messenger that was a standing rule among  the mahogany garden  peters men up from the coast to morida and on to valladolid by train slow train the engine of which ate up cords of small wood from piles cut and assembled by maya peons along the right of way on from the sun-smitten cluster of stone stucco and wattle-work houses of valladolid he had traveled slowly and tediously by platform car this meant a little truck about the size of a hand-car with a canopy over it drawn by two galloping mules driven by a squat brawny maya in cotton shirt and pants whose stubby bare great toes turned in whose skin was the color of an old penny whose close-cropped wiry hair was crowned with a straw sombrero wound with green and yellow in whose teeth was clenched a long cruel plaited whip at whose side hung one of the long massive-bladed bent-tipped henequen knives-a formidable figure who was strangely shy and gentle save to the mules-and for them he found more curses threats and poetical phrasings of damnation and opprobrium than haskell had ever heard before at the end of the last mile of the narrow rusted tram-rails the ultimate means of travel wras mule-back the last driver of the last tram had hinted that it was wise to travel by day only but now after nightfall of the second day the white man and his indian guide had ridden up to the gates of the calderon y ortegas hacienda been admitted by a servant who had vanished without a word and now haskell was walking up and down the patio in the moonlight waiting-waiting to see if some unknown assassin with the henequen knife would get him before the problematic host arrived or vice versa he was not greatly alarmed but it wtas not a good wtay to begin on a piece of peters work-to allow himself to be killed or wounded or to be compelled to kill in self-defense some one with whom he had no quarrel so he kept his right hand only near the butt of his revolver there was one advantage he had though the duel had been going on ten minutes at least the unknown second principal was not aware that haskell knew of the danger the first thing haskell had noticed was the fall of a bit of stucco as big as a pea he had glanced up to the arches of the second-floor gallery in time to see a shadowy figure whisk back out of sight a moment later wyhen he had crossed to the other side of the court and was directly under the gallery he had heard the swiftly indrawn breath of some being above him and experience having taught him that the drawing of breath precedes the deliberate blow with a knife he had stooped pretending to have dropped his gauntlet out of the tail of his eye he had seen the downward sweep of the blade drawing from his pocket a little round mirror from a transit he held it in the palm of his left hand in such a way that it could not be seen from above and though he appeared to be looking down and paying no attention to what went on over his head he could see well enough to be in no danger so long as the unknown pursued the tactics of creeping around the galleries and striking when the marked man came within reach below at the time of the second blow all that haskell had seen was an arm and head over the parapet and then the sudden swoop and the blow it had been too quick for him to catch more than a glance in the little mirror but from that head he had caught the gleam of two eyes that shone like the eyes of a cornered mountain cat now he walked into the middle of the patio and carefully surveyed the darkened galleries not a light was there in all the house without the horses stamped in the dust where the indian held them from a distance came the crooning song of the servants in their outlying quarters a native dog barked inquiringly in the same general direction and overhead the moon rode the cloudless purple sky verily outpouring a torrent of radiance suddenly he caught a movement in the shadows back under the arches and could scarcely refrain from putting a steel-jacketed bullet into the spot and then forth into the moonlight there stepped a slender girl haskells heart beat faster at the sight than it had a few minutes before wrhen he had escaped the first blow and he dropped his hand hurriedly from the pistol-butt the thought came-what if he had yielded to impulse and fired at the movement in the shadows the girl appeared in the moonlight under the arch at the head of the broad stone stairway leading down into the patio at the top step she paused and looked down she was taller and slighter than the sturdy  adventure maya women haskell had seen there was a loose curl in her heavy hair and from the point where she had it caught up at the crown of her head and fastened it with the familiar thorn and red flower it fell over her shoulders far below her hips her neck and shoulders were bare on her little feet were the soft maya sandals and her dress was the simple white native tunic falling in straight grecian lines from shoulder to ankle and broidered with a deep hem of the brilliantly colored maya patterns when she turned on the stair so that the moonlight fell full on her face haskell felt a queer little thrill in his throat-it was the type that is the boast of leon-shadowed slumbrous languorous eyes features of the delicacy of the high-caste singalese cream and olive coloring with a little rich red mouth with simple grace she came slowly down the stair and with his spurs jingling on the red tiling of the court haskell crossed to meet her he was absurdly conscious of the layers of dust that lay not only on his clothing but even in the thick yellow brown curls of his head as he swept off his hat and bowed wondering what language she would use buenas tardes senor she said solving the question by addressing him in a quaint spanish with a curious little purl in it haskell was glad that he was not compelled to use the maya which he had begun to acquire from the time he encountered the first yucateco on the steamer from vera cruz he was sorry to note in her manner however not only an absence of the cordiality with which the spanish-american greets a guest but a little constraint a certain chill dignity such as even a chance visiting stranger would not be accorded ordinarily he returned her salutation  good evening senorita i am mr haskell an engineer sent from the united states to this hacienda where letters of instruction await me my preliminary instructions came by telegram i have no letters nor do i know for whom to inquire save some member of the family calderon y ortegas i am ortegas y escalendon senor she said with an added touch of hauteur knowing the custom of a husbands following his own name with that of his wife this told him that she was a niece on the maternal side of the family calderon y ortegas in the recesses of the house somewhere there was a low murmur of hushed voices the girl saw that haskell heard them and a little flush crept into her cheeks while a quick change came over her as she looked at him standing embarrassed and uncertain before her my uncle and his sons are absent from the plantation senor but i bid you welcome pray believe our house is yours she accompanied this many-centuries-old conventional formula with a fleeting smile which seemed to say that though she had been sent to greet him and show him that he was unwelcome she meant to receive him regardless of all considerations haskell felt a warm impulse of gratitude toward her for at the words there was a note of impatience and displeasure in the hushed voices and then silence twice she clapped her little palms together and the servant who had admitted him reappeared took the horses and guide in charge after laying off haskells bags and a sullen old maya woman who had been lurking under the arches led him away to a chamber that opened on the gallery directly at the spot where the unknown knife-wielder must have stood at the time of the delivery of the second blow haskell swept the shadowed spots with cautious eyes but once within the chamber seeing the spotlessly white pallet the little gilt shrine the great earthen bathing-vessel brimming with water he breathed a sigh of relief for he was weary from his long journey and here before him wrere the means to the ends of physical comfort and cleanliness at least he stepped to the door to close it and place the heavy bar across it when the old servant had backed out he saw that the girl was still standing on the stair at the senors pleasure will he attend in the dining-hall she said in her low sweet voice that carried clearly across the broad patio on his acknowledgment she turned and walked slowly away toward the gate where the shadows swallowed her the grace with which she moved the exquisite lines of her arms and throat caused haskell to exclaim to himself but nevertheless when he had bathed and replaced his riding-clothes with white military ducks he drew across his chest the civilian holster designed to carry the heavy pistol under the left arm and examined the wreapon carefully before he put it in its resting-place the mahogany garden  there was a knock at the door cautiously he opened it to find a porter with a much-stamped and counter-stamped envelope addressed to him in care of sr don felipe ramon batista calderon y ortegas he ripped it open the firms draft for five thousand and his letter of instructions dictated by peters himself dear haskell you are permanently to supplant mclrnery in this work and are expected to carry it through to success i am sending my nephew john peters jr who has just finished in berlin to join you and i expect you to break him in if he does not show the proper fitness give me time enough to get another man to you and ship him back without compunction i am sending him to the hot country to get him out of the way of one of trains-bys girls as much as anything i regret to be unable to inform you in detail of your new work mclrnery had it in hand direct from the men of the syndicate who investigated it and he is in no condition to transmit his information however i trust you to get along without it two or three months ago the syndicate acquired from sr don juan rafelo calderon y ortegas the rights to all the hardwood on lands of the extreme southern part of the family estate on a royalty basis and you are to estimate the extent of it select the means of getting it to tide-water prepare the specifications for the needed plant order the same through us and install the needed equipment when it is in operation it will be time to consider placing the work in  charge of a superintendent now my dear haskell i have given you no childs task in this mahogany garden as embrie calls it and i have been opposed sufficiently in my selecting so young a man as you despite the efficiency you displayed in telluride and the copper river valley to be more than anxious that you should allow nothing to interfere with your making a sweeping success both for my own sake and vours remember that every problem you face is yours not mine i wish you unbounded good fortune yours cordially john j peters and the first dash out of the box some one tries to behead me and a pretty girl treats me as if the murder would have been justifiable said haskell puzzling over the strangeness of his reception where nothing that had gone before had conveyed any hint of unpleasantness chapter ii don felipe returns when he stepped forth to the gallery he stopped a moment scrutinized every shadow listened for every sound and then strode along toward the stair keeping well away from the doorways that opened on the arched passageway the sight of a servant bearing a covered dish into a lighted doorway guided him and he followed into a spacious chamber to the right of the head of the stair in the center stood a great table of dark wood roughly polished and evidently hacienda made around it were many chairs also of hand workmanship the walls were bare and on the tiled floor were some simple bright-colored mats in heavy silver candelabra burned a number of candles lighting the table and the earthen bowls of fruit fresh cheese and cold fowl grouped about one end with some bottles of liquors and an oil a on the porous sides of which showed the exuding water the evaporation of which rendered cold the water within the servant stood aside steeped in the awkwardness of unaccustomed service and the door at the farther end of the apartment opened and four women entered one a massive woman of fifty in an unstayed black silk gown heavy old gold bracelets and chain and with bare feet and broad sandals two younger women unmistakably her daughters though of a distinctly mestizo or part indian type clad in the simple maya tunics with a ribbon or bit of jewelry to give a touch of finery and lastly the girl who had received him with concealed interest and amusement haskell noted that in greeting him the mother executed something resembling the courtesy of the empire the first daughter used the maya straight-backed cross-legged bow and the other faltered between the two plainly he read the story of the situation in its minor points knowing the habitual seclusion of their women by the rural gentlemen of spanish-american lands he saw that this appearance was prompted largely by curiosity which could be indulged in the absence of the lords and masters of the casa he had no doubt that before him stood senora calderon y ortegas and her two daughters and he marveled at the difference between them and the niece by reason of the hour he felt sure they had eaten the last meal of the day and appeared again to see what he was like under pretense of keeping him company at his meal haskell noted that the niece did not raise her eyes though her cheeks were flushed as if with anger and she took her place at the table as if in sufferance only this nettled him and relieved his own embarrassment with what savoir faire his age experience  adventure and understanding of latin peoples permitted he took the situation in hand and led the talk to matters of the outside world the things of which secluded women dream hungry dreams his reward was speedy and the stages of the change that came over them were interesting to watch from a stiff dignity that had a strong undercurrent of dislike and enmity they passed to a slight interest then a frank curiosity then questions and naive comment ending in open good-humor through it all the niece sat silent and for the most part with averted eyes plainly she had been rebuked for her welcome to haskell and was very resentful physically fortified by his excellent meal and a glass of satisfactory claret haskell talked on until he made the fatal mistake of a reference to his mission a swift cloud crossed the elder womans dark brow the girls dropped their eyes and fell silent and there was a little impatient movement on the part of the niece that told him he had blundered in a moment they rose and bidding him an almost curt goodnight left the room taking one of the candles the servant lighted haskell to his door and was backing out with his  buenas noches buenas noches senor when haskell called him back see here muchacho do you know what this is twenty pesetas senor answered the man looking at the coins well i want you to take this and to understand that there is plenty more for you if you will work for it i come to this house as a stranger but i am an honest man and i come on honest business with no intentions of harming any one or doing any wrong you know and i know that i am looked on as an intruder as an enemy i do not know why will you tell me why senor is a friend and guest in the casa no harm can come to him answered the maya shuffling his feet and looking anywhere but into haskells eyes the engineer laid a gold piece of the largest denomi-tion on the coins and pushed them toward the man with the tips of his fingers the indian shot him one furtive glance you know that is not true nacion i am not afraid but i do not want to go on in the dark my father and his father worked on this hacienda and i shall work here and with the sacred mercy my children shall work here i can not serve the senor the mans direct and simple expression of loyalty evoked haskells admiration he slowly pocketed the money he had heard that the mayas though a terrible people when roused were brave patient and steadfast you are an honest man nacion good-night the indian turned to go but at the door he hesitated fumbled at the tawdry sacred medallion at his throat and said in a lowered tone the senor should be very careful and go soon or it may be the same things will come to him as to the other caballero what other caballero what do you mean encarnacion stepped quickly to the pallet and drew from its place of concealment a little red morocco photograph-case and gave it to haskell within was the small picture of a very beautiful girl across one corner of which wras written semper fidelis gertrude trainsby it had come from young peters personal belongings the lad was here in advance of him thanks to the lost days at vera cruz apparently he had occupied this very room where wras he now what had befallen him what did the maya mean by the same things which had befallen the youngster as these questions flashed through his mind haskell felt a hot anger rising within him he whirled on the impassive maya this belongs to a young man who was to wtork with me in this country i command you to tell me wthere he is i do not know when was he here don felipe can tell you all-but- senor do not wait till he comes back the man was retreating toward the door as he said this and with the last word he darted out haskell cursed softly under his breath pocketed the little red case inspected the room with the candle to be sure that there were no means of entrance save the door and after barring this went to bed the revolver tied to his right wrist by a thong somewhere about dawn there was a clatter of hoofs in the courtyard and in his subconsciously alert state the noise awoke haskell peering over the transom he could see several horsemen below three in the the mahogany garden  habiliments of haciendados were ascending the stair and four others evidently servants were leading away the horses and mules as nearly as he could make out in the dim light the party had been on a hard ride and before they entered the house the three men thrashed their clothing to get off the dust one of these was squat massive and wore a heavy square black beard the others were younger and slighter men -evidently the master of the house and his sons haskell noted that they were well armed bearing pistols on hip and leaving three carbines leaning against the stone newel at the right of the foot of the stair rapidly he dressed and when silence had fallen over the place he stepped from the room and reconnoitered no one was in sight save the porter squatted by the gate asleep acting on impulse the engineer stepped quickly down to the carbines threw the bolts and drew out the firing-pins then he returned to his room and waited soon the songs of the peons on their way to the henequen fields rose and died away the household servants began to appear and the two daughters came forth on the gallery from a door on the other side of the court next encarnacion came to his door bringing a bowl of fruit and pieces of bread browned through and through and a mug of milk and coffee don felipe is home i see remarked haskell as he ate si senor was the indianssole response and try as he would the engineer could not draw him into conversation when the maya had gone haskell lighted a cigar and began to ponder his best course in the face of the baffling strangeness of all that had happened the question was whether to take the bull by the horns at once or to pursue the policy he had begun the night before when he had pretended not to be aware of the knife-blows he decided to let circumstances guide him and leaving the middle buttons of his jacket unloosed so that he could draw with proper speed if matters came to a sudden climax he strolled forth on the gallery chapter iii more warnings just around the pillars of the corner he beheld a pretty sight holding a parrot on one forefinger senorita ortegas y escalendon stood leaning against the parapet feeding the creature berries from the other hand her hair was bound in heavy braids about her little head and her simple clinging tunic revealed the exquisite lines of her body sufficiently to complete a pose of the utmost grace in her creamy cheeks shone a faint color and her eyes were dancing as she teased the bird at the sound of his step she turned and haskell meant that she should read the admiration in his eyes her lowered lids and heightened color signified that his wish was granted buenos dias senorita he said cheerily good morning senor we hope that you rested well in our house last night haskell said that he had and spoke of the beauty of the morning then with his eyes on her face to catch its most vagrant expression he asked whether the master of the house was among the men who had arrived at dawn her lower lip quivered a trifle her eyes grew shadowed and after a quick glance at him she said as if addressing the bird don felipe is now in the house and may i see him soon to take up my business with him  she put her hand on his arm with a quick detaining protesting gesture and as quickly withdrew it  oh senor you must go away i am so sorry that you came since i have found you here senorita i am very very glad i came he answered putting a purposeful earnestness in his tone i came here in all innocence and honesty supposedly at the wish of don felipe and all concerned and i do not see why i should go away until my business is finished you surprise me by what you say what do you mean child  she shuddered and turned away without answer within one of the rooms on the family side there was a peremptory hand-clap a call in a brutal tone for a servant followed by a savage ill-natured oath the girl shrank as from an imaginary blow and half pointed to the door of the room from which the sounds came encarnacion appeared on winged feet to answer the summons is that don felipe asked haskell in a hardened tone that is the master i beg you i implore you to go she whispered trembling and  adventure coming close to him her eyes on the doorway down the gallery with an assuring protective instinct he put his arm half about her the color flamed into her cheeks she threw back her head and gave him one blazing flash from her eyes as she drew herself erect but before the look that had come on his face at the touch the nearness of her her glance softened her lower lip trembled like that of a hurt child and she whirled away from him and vanished down the corridor leaving him strangely stirred with emotions new and strange to him but not unwelcome little girl he said to himself if this were hell i would stay left alone he leaned against one of the pillars smoking quietly and listening in a little while nacion appeared backing out the door and in a moment don felipe followed his heavy hair and his thick beard were still damp from his bath but his cotton clothing was white fresh and immaculate and there was an air about him that evoked haskells admiration ak senor he cried at sight of the american buenos dias buenos diasl i regret not having been at home when you came my house is yours pray believe me and he advanced to bow courteously smiling with his lips but not with his eyes nor did he offer his hand for which haskell thought the better of him dont speak of it sir your family received me most hospitably and if my instructions had been more definite i should have known how and to whom to send notice of my coming haskell with his right hand never far from the opening in his jacket near the butt of his revolver watched the other narrowly did you have a pleasant journey to the peninsula it is useless to ask farther than that as we are so primitive here that traveling is hard for men used to the easy ways of civilization so you must forgive our humble and comfortless methods of living senor haskell the engineer could scarce repress a smile as he thought of the intended addition of thirty inches of henequen knife to his comforts the night before but he said cordially for years i have been living in camps in outlands and i like the life and contrary to what you say of your district i have enjoyed my two days in it very much and am looking forward to a pleasant stay during the period of my work it shall be our gratification to contribute in every way to your pleasure and entertainment don felipe had a little light in his eyes as he said this that would have been envied by the devil himself of course having lost several days i am anxious to get on the grounds at once now to clear away any misunderstanding i am here as the agent with full authority of the syndicate which has acquired from senor don juan rafelo calderon y ortegas the rights to cut and export the mahogany and other hard woods from certain lands close to the border of the district and if my calculations are correct the nearest part of the tract is not over ten miles to the south i was ordered by telegraph to come to this hacienda and here i found a letter of instructions senor don juan rafelo is your father my father is dead this is a brother there was a hidden significance in his choice of words is the forest near  yes yonder not a league begins the great woodland and it extends on hundreds of miles and there are things hidden away in it which the world never dreams of yes i know the central american forest is comparatively unexplored and though the sun shines fiercely and the rain pours down like a river from the clouds and the trees and vines grow thick some men may pass through parts of it but they will come out knowing little even the maya aborigines fear it well with your help in securing provisions and a guide i shall ride to-day to begin taking care of the part of it assigned to me ah but not to-day senor you have no reason for haste is my hospitality falling so short-- no far from it don felipe but i have lost too much time and i must push on to join young peters my assistant haskells eyes dwelt coldly on the others face peters peters your assistant is now in the mahogany garden  he came here before me have you not seen him don felipe shook his head as if deeply puzzled no senor haskell i have not seen him or heard of him slowly without taking his eyes from the the mahogany garden  yucateco haskell drew out the little red case you surprise me this is his i found it last night in the room in which i slept beyond a fierce gleam in his eyes don felipe gave no sign of being disconcerted strange indeed he said suavely  there was a young gentleman who stopped with us one night wthile i was away and he slept in that room but i did not learn his name or his business he rode on before my return and i do not know where he is for a moment haskell was afraid to speak for his blood was boiling within him but he realized that being single-handed against a rich and powerful haciendado with hundreds of peons at his back and far from communication with the outside world his only hope of avenging anything that had befallen young peters and of saving his own life was to dissemble till he could secure a position of vantage this is most unfortunate for i can not waste time in hunting for him and i need his help at once he is certain to return here to join me and the best that i can do is to have you send him on to my camp no senor you must permit me to send my boys into the forest to look for his party and you can remain here and give us the pleasure of your society meanwhile your kindness overwhelms me but i regret to say that i must ride on to-day can it be arranged that i start at once if the senor will he will said don felipe with a shrug of his shoulders he called to the porter ordered his own and haskells horses and sent an indian maid scurrying to prepare the required provisions he disappeared into his room returning in a little while booted and spurred and by the time haskell had assembled his belongings the horses were waiting looking down from the gallery haskell saw that the party was to be made up of himself the indian who had ridden with him to the hacienda don felipe and two burly mozos armed with the long henequen knives just then nacion appeared haskell saw something flutter from his hand to the tiling and picking it up he reentered his room it was a crumpled green leaf but inside was a tiny note the senor haskell-do not go do not go i shall never see you again for you go to die emalia chapter iv an attack and a rescue titaskells heart seemed to expand j- j- within him it mattered to her whether she did see him again perhaps she wras right but he felt his chances wrere better in the open than in the hacienda so he stood at the head of the stair and bowed low before senora calderon y ortegas as he expressed his gratitude for the pleasure of having been in her house then he descended and mounted keeping a careful eye on don felipe the latter seemed quite merry and saying that they might find a spotted cat in the woods caught up one of the carbines and threw it by the strap across his pommel for a man accustomed to the handling of firearms this wras a strange thing to do any one riding up even with the muzzle was likely to be killed by an accidental discharge but haskell pretending not to see quietly and unhesitatingly took his place beside the haciendado not a foot from the muzzle of the wreapon and so they rode away at the first opportunity haskell looked back and wras sure that a certain figure he saw darting among the bushes that screened the way from the house to the little houses of the peons was that of little emalia and stealing a glance now and then in a few minutes he made out the same figure returning and another a little man mounted on a pony riding swiftly off in a direction that paralleled their course as if he meant to intercept them if don felipe or the mozos noted the little rider they gave no sign the party wras now moving straight south far far distant was an uneven blue line the higher wooded lands to the right and left and behind them stretched uncounted miles of scrub thickets with now and then a full-grown tree the dreary waste broken by the henequen fields the miles of rows of the golden source of the peninsulas vast wrealth haskell had noted that the plants were very much like the century-plant scores of thick fleshy leaves averaging a yard in length growing out from one low thick stem through those leaves he knew ran a fiber which when stripped of the watery pulp made sisal hemp from which the  adventure worlds binder twine for harvesting machines is spun grown and shipped to the united states at a cost of two cents a pound and bringing ten cents a pound after the destruction of the philippine hemp industry the yucatecos-white mestizo and maya-owning the lands the only lands in the world on which the plant could be grown were made millionaires in a few years time not one-twentieth of the land could be cultivated because of the scarcity of labor and that kept up the price after the fifth year a plant would produce for thirty years and it required little attention for the soil was so dry and stony that even the weeds were unenthusiastic not that there was not enough rainfall the trouble was that wrhen the rain fell it went down through the soil at once and collected on the hard-pan floor from ten to a hundred feet below the upper level where it formed subterranean rills brooks swamps and rivers called cenotes a peculiar condition similar to that in certain districts in the belgian congo the american desert and in the jamaican cockpit country here and there dotted about the level plain of the peninsula were holes where the earth had fallen in exposing the underground streams sometimes the hole was a few feet deep sometimes one must descend a fraction of a mile to get water the greater part of an hour passed before the party was beyond the bounds of the last henequen field and out of sight of the last group of laboring peons the trail led straight on into the thicket and haskell noted that the number of large trees was increasing but he dared not take his eyes from matters close at hand from the tail of his eye he must catch the first suspicious movement of don felipes hands once or twice don felipe reined up to scan some tracks in the trail and again he called a halt and commanded silence while he listened as if he heard sounds ahead that alarmed him but he rode on again until they came to a cluster of rocks haskell was forced to ride a little to the front he heard the click of the bolt of the carbine as don felipe threw in a cartridge and as he turned the muzzle was pointed full at his back hate and murder shone in the haciendados eyes as he pulled the trigger but the carbine did not speak there was only the snap of the trigger you dirty murderous cowardly dog cried haskell throwing the blue nose of his gun level writh the yucatecos eyes charging like a dragoon came the first of the two mozos the other could not get around haskells astonished guide who had reined up squarely across the trail seeing the flash of the upraised henequen knife the american swung the pistol at right angles and let three of the bullets from the magazine pour forth before he took his finger from the trigger the terrific impact of heavy steel-jacketed missiles seemed to lift the mozo out of the saddle and he pitched sideways among the rocks while his pony clattered on towrard the forest but don felipe had had time to draw his revolver a shot splintered haskells pommel and burned his thigh another whirred under his ear and then he fired the glittering pistol whirled into the air and don felipe cursing bitterly clapped his left hand to his right forearm where there was a red welling of blood on the white sleeve rearing madly and backing from the flame of the revolver before his eyes the yucatecos horse threw himself and rider behind the guide and his mount it was a stroke of fortune for the hacien-dado this confusion between the two indians and the blocking of haskells line of fire he saw it and seizing the reins whirled his horse and sped down the trail the mozo followed suit and the best that haskell could do was to send don felipes horse to his knees the rider was off as the horse fell up behind the mozo and out of sight untouched though haskell sent the last of nine shots after them well back on the trail could be heard the drumming of many hoofs and many voices shouting in advance was a lone rider approaching rapidly now he dashed into sight it was the little man haskell had seen riding away from the quarters of the peons he was a cripple with a withered hand and a queer twisted face senor dont wait come quick senor follow me and ride fast he cried reining up and turning under the very nose of haskells horse the engineer stooped and caught up the carbine rode over to don felipes dying horse and lifted the ammunition belts from the saddle then set out after the newcomer and the guide already a hundred feet ahead on the trail toward the forest the mahogany garden  in about ten minutes the three came to a little eminence and the cripple drew rein and pointed back not more than half a mile behind them was a large party of horsemen haskell studied them with his glasses don felipe was leading all the others his right arm bandaged roughly and bound across his chest his two sons close behind him and a dozen mozos from the hacienda mounted on any sort of animal from an antiquated stallion to a female donkey in foal  let me see if i have forgotten the trick said haskell throwing open the carbine replacing the firing-pin throwing the bolt and taking careful aim with the crack of the gun the horse of the second son plunged headlong sending his rider sprawling and the whole column came to a halt this little thing is a wonder said haskell gazing at the neglected piece with admiration as they rode on the trees and the undergrowth grew suddenly more dense they had come to the belt of soil that retained the moisture and the tropical forest was begun save for the stifling closeness of the air it was a relief from the sun to get in under the interlocking arms of the great giants woven together with festoons of creeping plants whose main stems were nearly as large as the trees themselves and whose farthest newest tendrils would be hundreds of feet from the parent root it is a popular idea that the tropical forest always teems with animal life the truth is that there is far less than in the temperate zone save in rare localities the section through which the riders wrere now passing was silent and deserted and after half anlhour the very sound of the horses hoofs seemed to become magnified to something enormous and dreadful the little withered man begun to scan the wayside signs carefully for the trail was growing fainter and at a point where it had branched he had taken the faintest of three paths at last he halted before a veritable wall of creepers and parasitic plants at one side of the trail and moving a part of the whole aside as a curtain signed for haskell to dismount and lead in his horse to his amazement the engineer found himself in an old machete-trimmed pathway now growing shut once more for two hundred feet along this artificial path they made their way and came to a veritable wall of growing tree trunks matted with vines something in the set of it suggested to haskell that it had been purposefully planted like a hedge and he said as much to the cripple who smiled and nodded his head and said cryptically when a man lives in among the trees he must build his walls with them twisting around this trunk stooping under that one and squeezing between another two they passed the living barrier and stood in a great circular place grown up with a thicket to the height of a mans head from the center rose a four-cornered mound at least ninety feet tall and on the truncated topembowered in great trees was a broad stone building with ruined sides carved in beautiful deeply cut designs all along the face of the wall nearest to him was a row of darker stone on which haskell made out successive figures of the central american tiger el iglesia del tigre said the little old cripple making a curious gesticulation with his withered hand haskell knew he was looking for the first time on one of tens of thousands of ruined buildings which dot the country from the gulf of mexico to the lakes of nicaragua bespeaking the life and death of a wonderful people older than the aztecs even older than the toltecs perhaps even more ancient than the colhuans and some say that these stone cities often miles in extent were teeming with the life of a highly civilized people long before the days of babylon or the birth of the first pharaoh chapter v the temple of the tiger the engineer stood gazing at the strength and beauty of the architecture of the ruined building the cripple watched him a moment with pleasure and then said you see but one and a little one senor the white men have found uxmal chichen-itza palenque copan and the other great cities but the others they have not seen there are those through which the senor must travel half the day to pass even without looking ah for they are far greater the trees have growm up to hide them since the great serpent took our people away and the senor might travel through a  adventure city and be within ten steps of a thousand houses and yet see none of them i have passed through such and when a little boy with my father he showed me one of the greatest of all the temples and said that some day he would run away from the hacienda and we would travel to the heart of the forest where there was a city of our people that still lived it was the old familiar evasive legend which one hears throughout the length and breadth of the continent the circumstantial tale that somewhere in the depths of the forest there is a city where some of the ancient race still live cut off from the world by the wilderness suddenly the american realized that the cripple was taking the saddle from his pony and he cried here mozo what are we going to do this is no place to camp-no water the senor does not know said the cripple gently from a hole in the stone seat of el tigre grande runs fine water our horses are tired and no one at the hacienda can find the way here but me let don felipe ride on-let him ride to purgatory-he can not come here out of the door of the old temple ran a little stream and it cascaded in a deeply worn channel down to the level on which they stood the freed pony was even now wending his wray to the little pool formed at the base of the mound how without a hidden pump could that wrater be made to flow from that high point within miles there was no land that wtas as high it could not be a spring all right my man said haskell yielding  by the way what is your name how did you happen to come to my help and what is the meaning- the senor serves himself best by the single question that calls for the single answer said the little man with a queer bow i am juan and my father was pedro juan and my grandfather was juan ramon we have been of the hacienda since the coming of the true religion and the days of the old wars but my mother was from the hacienda ortegas and when their lands were taken away by the governor my mother bade me see to the mother of the little one the mother of senorita emalia inquired haskell  si senor now i lose all things for her how your friend comes here to take away from the mayas their forest and don felipe and his sons ride out with him as they rode out with you is he dead do you know anything juan they rode out they rode back this morning and he is dead or they would not have come back it is as it should be you should have been killed also haskell looked at him aghast i should be killed why don felipe had the papers to say that you would take away our forest no juan not your forest just some of the trees and don felipe has been paid tens of thousands of pesetas to allow me to do it then he lied to us it seemed queer to haskell that don felipe having the absolute power even to life and death over the peons of his remote hacienda should have taken the trouble to explain or lie to them but he put it among the other mysteries of this strange advent ure tell me r ho tried to kill me from the gallery of the house juan ernesto you shot him a while ago and why if you think or did think i should be killed did you ride out to-day and help to save my life because the little one came to me and said the ortegas needed that i should ride ahead of you that i should kill don felipe if necessary and take you to the runaway mayas in the forest whence no man ever comes back to the hacienda even though he starves the senorita told you to kill don felipe if you had to do so to save me si senor would you have done it from where he lay on the grass juan turned so that he displayed his withered arm drawn face misshapen leg when i was in the woods with my father he had run away with me but when i and my brothers were starving we w-ent back and don felipes father beat my father to death before all the hacienda me they tied up and let little don felipe beat me till he was so weary that he wept since that day i have been like this haskell could not repress a shudder and he found himself looking forward to the next time don felipe calderon y ortegas wras within whip-range the mahogany garden  so you are going to take me to the runaways in the woods eh juan since i have business to which to attend suppose i will not go   then i will bring them and we will take you haskell laughed outright at the cool finality of the assertion all right juan we will wait and see taking his observation instruments from his bags haskell parceled them between the three of them and led the way up the steep slope of the mound saying he wanted to make sure of their exact location the red men looked on the lensed brass things as the appurtenances of witchery and handled them with fear the ruined temple haskell found to be far less ruined than he had imagined the walls were of solid masonry about eight feet thick and twenty-five feet high the space they enclosed was about eighty by one hundred all around the walls were the niches in which the wooden beams rotted and gone thousands of years ago had once reposed when they supported the roof there were no rooms but on either side of an altar on which perched a huge stone tiger were the remains of foundations that showed there had been wooden structures within the square from just beneath the tiger ran a two-inch stream of pure cold water-a complete mystery to him an insoluble problem in hydrostatics on both the outer walls and inner panels were inset single stones about a foot square on the face of each of which was carved a different design of curves and dots the indecipherable hieroglyphics of the so-called maya language the written stone-treasured narratives of a people which le plonjeon says will add ten thousand years to the history of humanity when the man is found who can read them aright in the enclosure were a number of large trees one a gigantic hardwood tree at least eight or nine hundred years old and reaching up one hundred and fifty feet in the air buckling on steel climbers haskell spiked his way up the great trunk clinging to the huge ridges of the bark and perching in a crotch near the top looked out over the scene to the north lay the reaches of the wild scrub thicket broken by the white cultivated expanse of the hacienda east west and south swept the forest to the eastward there seemed to be a  dip in the horizon at first he thought it was a low-lying cloud-field there but leveling his glasses he saw that the forest stopped short off-in fact seemed to have a sort of bay in it and that at the outer edge of this was the sea if it was swamp through which a channel could be forced and logs floated to tidewater he knew that it meant much to him he was about to descend thinking what a fort the temple would make when he noticed some moving spots between him and the far hacienda by careful work he made out that it was don felipes party returning not all of them however one son and five men had been left behind in the forest the haciendado had left a sort of patrol while he hurried home to have his wound dressed lay his plans and get reenforcements not to effect a capture once the fugitives were overtaken but to locate them none of them had seen juan at the time of the shooting and haskell realized that the two sons and the other men had ridden after don felipe not when they had discovered juans departure but when they had found the two carbines left behind to be minus their firing-pins that had told them that don felipe was armed with a useless weapon and that haskell was on his guard the natural thing had been to set out post-haste it was a relief to the engineer to think that emalias part in the affair was not discovered to lay her open to abuse perhaps real danger at the hands of her brutal uncle juan had built a fire of dry sticks when haskell descended after making a rough topographical map of the country and was preparing the evening meal careful that no smoke should rise from the cooking the blaze was screened within the temple and they kept it alight till long after dark the indian haskell had brought with him was very silent and apparently dejected all evening while the american sat by the fire listening to the tales of the old mayas which juan had to tell but neither of the others thought anything of the lads behavior and all three lay down to rest confident that where no enemy could find his way in daylight none could come by dark when haskell awoke at daybreak the first thing he noticed was that the indians place was empty calling to juan he ran  adventure to the door of the temple the lad was gone and had taken his horse not only that but he had taken so much of the food that there was not enough left for more than two meals it was plain that he had noted carefully the path through the labyrinth of tree-trunks and filled with fears of the forest being a plantation-bred indian pure and simple he had deserted if he had left early he might have reached the hacienda by midnight if so then don felipe and his men might be at the very door of their hiding-place this minute mounting the tree quickly while juan prepared breakfast haskell surveyed the country nowhere was there a sign of the pursuit but as he studied the trail from the hacienda his heart gave a great leap in an opening a big white horse showed for a moment then came a mule bearing a mozo but the rider of the white horse at the next opening haskell saw it was emalia riding toward the forest in desperate haste chapter vi nunez paola taking a reflector he tried to throw a ray of the rising sun in her direction as the signal-corps man heliographs if the rays reached her she did not make them out for she rode on without heeding some of don felipes men descried him though a half-spent bullet whined through the air below him and a report among the trees to the west located the marksman there was another and closer shot from less than two hundred yards beyond the labyrinth and taking the sheltered side of the tree haskell hurried down not only was their hiding-place discovered but they were surrounded  juan was painfully indifferent about the matter every man must die some time said he with a toss of his head but he agreed with haskell that they could stand siege so long as the food held out and that forty men could not take the mound even by assault save in the hours between sunset and moonrise the temple had but the one entrance and they need defend that and no more as for evacuating and taking flight there was no path except the one by which they had entered and this must be known to the enemy with a heavy heart haskell went about inspecting the outside of the temple from the top of the wall that emalia should imperil herself for his sake was the depressing painful thought though it brought him a great joy to know that her iieart had prompted her to make what was plainly a useless attempt having made certain that the temple could be approached only by the front slope of the mound he descended and helped juan make a barricade for the entrance by great effort they got one of the horses half way up the slope intending to use them for food if need be when a shot from the forest dropped the animal and a sharp fire that followed compelled them to retreat to the temple walls the morning grew on slowly and at last the sun was at the meridian all was still and peaceful a vagrant troop of monkeys passed in the tree-tops at some distance and during the afternoon they heard now and then the deep solemn note of a distant bell el campanerol whispered juan crossing himself and what is el campanero he is a bird of size and his voice is the voice of a bell when the bell rings by day it is for souls that are to pass haskell laughed but a little shiver crept about the back of his neck as the evening drew on there fell a great stillness broken only by a little burst of outcries among some vagrant paroquets in the forest and the dismal sounds of the vultures descended from their vigilant circling aloft to their nights perch in the vicinity of the bones of the horse and man killed the day before the sun dropped slowly to the horizon and then as is the way in those latitudes seemed to shoot down in haste before the onrushing darkness in fifteen minutes it was a transition from broad daylight to velvety black gloom intensified by a miasmatic mist wafted inland from the seaboard haskell took a sheltered position behind the barricade juan crept down the gully worn by the water from the altar of the tiger first fastening in his hair two of the big glow-beetles of the region so that haskell should not mistake him for one of the enemy the keen eyes of the old indian were to be counted upon to detect the first signs of attack gradually his eyes marred by the uses the mahogany garden  of civilization became accustomed to the gloom and haskell found he could make out the trunks of trees and other objects at the base of the mound suddenly there was the scratch of a match in the stillness a point of flame burst out down the slope juan had lighted a clump of dried twigs and was hurrying up the gully as he darted across the open space before the barricade and climbed the front of it to enter a dozen points of flame cut the darkness from the edge of the labyrinth don felipes men had wasted no time the attack was on by the growing light of the fire haskell made out several darting figures among the trees and he fired a howl of pain was the sign of his success their bullets had pattered about the front of the temple juan had not had a close call even again haskell pulled trigger and every human form vanished from sight for a few minutes all was still then came a murmur of voices off to the right in the direction from which the wind was coming a light broke out there they too were lighting a fire now they kindled a second and a third and the terrible truth burst upon the two defenders by firing the dry undergrowth on the windward slope of the mound they meant to shroud the temple in a pillar of fire and either drive out their quarry or cook them alive with an oath haskell ran to the eastern wall and scrambled up the broken stones lying flat he crawtled to the edge two of don felipes men were just lighting another blaze and as he fired they darted for cover one of them falling but rising and dragging a wounded leg from the avidity of the flames it was plain that in five minutes a wall of fire would be beating against the temple that the parasitic plants on the stonework would catch and the interior would follow there was nothing to do but escape down the darkened side sliding back he began to descend but exposed himself for an instant and a shower of bullets cut the smoky air about him a blaze shot up from the other side of the mound they were trapped-completely fully trapped senor the voice came from close at hand as he touched the ground it was not juan speaking-juan was kneeling behind the barricade senor said the voice again haskell whirled it came from the wall within ten feet of him slowly one of the big stones there turned as if on a nicely adjusted pivot and in the narrow opening haskell beheld the dim figure of a beardless old man of powerful frame a shower of sparks and burning fragments fell within the enclosure lighting up the ancicnt carved walls and setting fire to the undergrowth in many places call your mozo and come quickly said the old man juan had no need to be called he had seen the seeming apparition and appeared to understand its exact meaning for he came on a hobbling run and as the stranger stepped aside was the first to dart into the opening in the masonry haskell handed the old man his carbine and darting across the enclosure caught up his bags and belongings and hurried back the barricade was now on fire and the heat was so intense that it was a great relief to gain the cool shelter of the narrow passage in the wall once within the old man followed him and closed the door of stone taking care that it should rest in exact position and thus keep its own secret feeling his way past the fugitives their unknown rescuer took the lead in conducting them along a short level passage then down a flight of steps haskell counted one hundred and sixty of these with two turns to the right he could touch both walls at all times now they appeared to have come to a small subterranean chamber and asking haskell to take hold of his bandero de stomacho he began to feel his way across apparently guiding himself by the jointures of the flagging under foot which he followed with his bare toes haskell heard a sudden rush of water close at hand and was conscious that everything about him was dripping wet may we stop he said his engineering instincts getting the better of him the old man came to a halt and lighting a match haskell held it above his head the dim light disclosed the four walls of a square chamber and at one side was a hewn-stone tank from which came the sound of the water lighting another match the american stepped to the side of it and looked in the mystery of the fountain of the tiger was solved at one end of the tank was the entrance for a stream of water of at least a two-foot  adventure volume-doubtless one of the underground brooks at the other end was the exit with a thin slab of slate that slid up and down to open and close it in the tank floated a sealed earthen vessel as the tank filled it rose and when it reached a certain height the lever to which it was tethered raised the slate slab and let out the water in the tank at the same time the rising water bore up another float that was held in place by two upright guides this float was large enough to carry a stone weighing at least two hundred pounds when the water was let out the weight of the descending stone bore on a rude stone piston in a stone cylinder and the water in the cylinder was driven up through a set of stone piles like tiles to the top of the mound haskell stood dumfounded before this visible evidence of the mechanical ingenuity of the priests of a civilization so long dead that there even is no certain name that it may bear come senor there is no time to spare urged the old man and haskell turned reluctantly away across the chamber was a low doorway and another passage that ran less than three hundred feet due east when it suddenly narrowed the roof lowered and on hands and knees they proceeded a short distance to emerge in the center of a thicket the light of the fire was very strong all about them and now and then they could get glimpses of the besiegers behind them slowly and carefully they made their way from shadow to shadow until they came to an almost impenetrable growth among the trees the old man took juans henequen knife and began to hew the vines the small branches and the entwining parasites haskell marveled at the ease and certainty of stroke from every conceivable angle also they were nearly noiseless and though the three proceeded very slowly and the old man cut incessantly for an hour his arm seemed never to tire or his aim to waver the moon was up and where it filtered through the branches the light was of great help as they drew away from the red glow of the conflagration at last they broke into a sort of glade and across this was an old path which made the way easier some time after midnight they came to another group of ruins in the forest the shapeless remains of three large buildings not raised on mounds and seeking a shelter among the dilapidated walls the old man commanded juan to light a fire sat down and drew from his girdle a cigar of excellent appearance haskell had been waiting for him to speak or offer some explanation for his strange appearance at the critical moment but as he did not seem to be inclined to communicativeness the american asked will you accept my gratitude for your sorely needed help to-night and will you tell me how it happened that you knew of our dilemma  there are many of us who would never have left the haciendas had they continued to be ortegas my older brother is by birth a cacique and when a daughter of the ortegas comes to the forest asking shelter from the cruelty of a calderon and seeking help for her friends no one among us wrould refuse her i was sent to get you away through the passage of which only the caciques know as they know of other things that the oppressors never have learned and never will learn and it was senorita ortegas y esca-lendon that sent you  she has forfeited her life in causing this mans flight from the hacienda and her uncle struck her and planned to beat her strung up in the patio when he returned so she persuaded my nephew to run away from the hacienda and bring her to us a queer softened feeling seemed to smother haskells heart and becloud his eyes  are we on our way to where she is  why should you ask us to show to a stranger the retreats which are our only hope of life until the time when we are strong enough to rise and drive the oppressors from our lands haskell saw the force of the argument and was silent a moment but the senorita-she can not go back what is to become of her  she is welcome to our poor houses in the forest as long as she lives a sudden resolution possessed the american but he did not speak of it instead he asked  where are we going now we shall rest till daylight and then i will lead you to the coast and to a village i know of there a fisherman with a boat can take you to cozumel and you can go home to your own country and not come back to steal our forests we will kill you and all you bring with you if you do  the mahogany garden  haskell stared hard at the stern features illuminated by the glow of the twig fire the snores of juan already asleep forgetful of the days danger and bloodshed were the only sounds for a minute i am not a thief amigo the men who sent me are not thieves we pay the rightful owners their own price for what we take or we do not take it we have paid calderon y ortegas much money and will pay very much more the old man seemed about to speak but checked himself and after gazing at the fire a moment sadly said the words of nunez paola have been spoken they are true and shall stand then he bowed himself by the fire drawing one arm under him across his abdomen and was soon asleep chapter vii two americans shake hands at daybreak the trio was astir and though weak from lack of food pushed on through the dense growth when he was not watching the marvelous woodcraft of the old man in places that seemed impassable haskell was studying the trees about him-mahogany dyewood the several hard gum-bearing trees the tropical cousins of the oak and the beech-hundreds of millions of feet of lumber millions of dollars worth of wealth at last toward noon the way before them began to lighten and they emerged at the edge of the tract which the american had seen from the tree the day before it was a dried salt marsh with a most peculiar consistency of soil the very material that under former conditions would have been turned into bituminous coal it was free from creeping vines but rich in timber especially in mahogany and dyewood around the edge was a path that was traveled with some frequency apparently and in the middle of the afternoon they came within sound of the sea passing over a hummock of rotten trap at one point haskell used the elevation to survey the marsh and he saw what was the occasion for its peculiar nature it was lower than the mean sea-level and in the rainy season would turn into a fresh lake which would force a channel through the sand ridge that separated it from the sea the tide invading the marsh would make it salt until such time as the wind and waves would pack the channel with sand and debris in the beginning of the dry season and the sun would dry up the enclosure for the six months to follow when he had determined this he begged for a halt and taking an observation figured out the position and compared it with his maps this thirty square miles of sublevel timber land was part of his huge task he felt his heart tighten within him when they reached the beach their guide turned northward and after about two miles of tramping over the dunes they came to a cove in which an indian fishing village nestled embowered in palms and plantains within the bar rode a half-dozen fishing-boats of the size in which the daring natives go to sea hundreds of miles as they neared the hamlet they were descried by a swarm of naked children who ran like young partridges haskell was deeply absorbed in some new plans and left juan and nunez paola to make all arrangements with the villagers who gathered to see the strangers he came to with a start just as they were entering the wattle-work hut that was to shelter them   haskell for heavens sake haskell  on a rude settee reclined the figure of a pale fever-burnt young man his neglected beard and matted hair giving his face the look of one insane the engineer turned and stood staring at the unknown under the coiba before the door i dont expect you to know me old chap im jack peters in an instant haskell was grasping the thin extended hand honestly i feel as if i were talking to a dead man great guns boy how did you get here what does this mean  then jack told him the story of which he already had glimmerings he had reached the hacienda only three days before haskell having come by a different route and when he told don felipe his mission the hacien-dado had laughed and refused to credit him jack had shown him the papers which the brother had signed in new york and don felipe had gone into a terrific rage he declared that his brother had had no right to dispose of the timber-rights-that they were the joint property of the whole family peters however was in possession of the search papers obtained from merida which showted that the brother was the sole  adventure trustee of the estate and the bargain legal don felipe then said that none of the interested parties would ever live to see it executed and the following morning had inveigled the youth on the ride of which haskell had heard had shot him through and left him for dead in the forest all he remembered was being borne on the shoulders of indian bearers he came to consciousness in the hamlet under the care of an herb-doctor and was getting well when jack had heard haskells story to the end he sat looking at the little red case which haskell had given him and after a moments silence put out his hand haskell will you shake on our getting that fellow   im with you and we will get him good  said the engineer gripping the thin palm but i tell you boy i feel there is something more behind all this than a mere quarrel between brothers over a trustees rights senor said a grave voice behind them your words are the words of the wise in some things but of the foolish in others take warning and return to your own country it was nunez paola there was a serious gentleness in his tone that gave his utterance unusual importance i-i did not know you understood english exclaimed haskell the old man shrugged his shoulders as he turned away and said i was general hernando ortegas body-servant at oxford fifty years ago-and i wrote his lessons for him silently they watched him as he strode away say haskell said the convalescent in a lowered tone we think we are a smart people up home but i will bet that a lot of these old mayas could give us cards and spades when haskell awoke the next morning after restful slumber and attacked the steaming breakfast juan placed before him he missed the old maya and asked for him juan shook his head he struck inland at daybreak some cakes inside his jacket and he bade me say to you senor that you are commanded finally to take the young senor and go back to your own country and come here no more the little withered man nearly dropped the leaf on which he was serving the fried plantains when haskell made his comment but in a moment the big american laughed ate his breakfast and lighting a cigar said juan go out and tell every able-bodied man you see that i want him to work for me and i will give him five dollars silver a day for a month oh senor senor ask me not this thing they will lash me for lying to them   why hang it i mean it go do as i tell you also if you will stay with me that is your wage-rate from this time on but let me tell you there is going to be more work and fewer fiestas in this corner of the republic than there has ever been before in ten minutes time there was a wildly excited mob of a hundred men before the hut and in the background were the women and children haskell with jack leaning on his arm walked out under the coiba and told them what he wanted he picked out twenty men who could handle axes and sent them into the forest to cut young trees for piles he picked out eight men who were boat-builders and set them to constructing four ten-foot barges half of the others were to get the piles out of the woods to the beach and the other half were detailed as shovelers with the exception of two men who understood carpentry and masonry these he held for further orders in an hours time the ordered work was under way and he was showing the carpenters how to build a pile-driver using a block of granite for the hammer with guiding grooves chiseled in the sides and a big drum windlass on which to draw it up not being ready to use the shovelers yet he led them down the beach to the point where the three had come to tide-water the day before and set them to building a working camp that evening he wrote a long cablegram to the firm and at dawn one of the boats put to sea to carry it to cozumel chapter viii war and engineering one week later jack peters was strong enough to transfer himself down to the working camp and there he found a work under way that made him yell and whoop beginning at low-water mark a double line of piles was being driven inland entirely the mahogany garden  across the beach ridge that barricaded the sea from the dried marsh the rows were twenty feet apart in the firmest part of the ridge the masons and carpenters were building a wooden sluice-gate set in stone blocks its lowest level was low-water mark the shovelers were at work taking out the sand on the landward side of the gate as they had taken out all but a small part on the seaward side to a level three feet below high-water mark do you mean you are really going to try to do a thing like that haskell wait just half an hour and see the tide is coming up now and he left the enthusiastic youngster to marshal more men on the landward work peters watched the tide creep up to near the three-foot sub-level and then he saw haskell coming back taking a shovel from a workman as he came open the gates and lash them cried the engineer and he watched the water narrowly as the gates were made ready then wading in at the edge of the water he threw a narrow channel through the slender sand barrier and saw the first rush of the sea-water through the canal which was still two-thirds choked with sand steadily the speed and volume of the rivulet grew as the tide increased one foot wide two feet wide four feet wide-more and more the sea-water rushing inland dug down and sideways into the sand and a yellow sand-laden boiling flood tumbled into the nearest reaches of the marsh spreading the sand ripped out from between the piling over a wide area then at last the tide was at maximum and began to ebb in half an hour the water that had flowed in with a mad rush came out with decreased volume and by the middle of the afternoon the canal stood revealed two rows of glistening piling with every grain of sand and soil washed out down to low-water level now haskell ordered the gates closed and all cracks sealed for the time being inland the floor of the marsh as far as could be seen was covered with a coating of wet sand that would not interfere with the lumbering in the least when dried but would make a far cleaner and better foundation than the salt peat of the bog when he understood the whole thing the younger man clapped an arm around the elder and said how i would like to see uncle john watching this he would have four joy- spasms a minute it is great haskell it is great he is wondering just about now what i want with twenty saws to work from barges twenty donkey-engines to run them three tow-boats and everything needed to get the lumber in the water trim the logs get them through the canal and tow them in rafts to steamer-side to be heaved inboard didnt you explain how you were going to do it no john peters doesnt want explanations before or after great guns haskell that must mean a forty per cent saving fob nearer sixty jack on thirty miles-let me see- his voice trailed off to a murmured following of his mental calculation till suddenly he clutched haskell by the arm and said almost aghast why man alive that means thirty million dollars about forty million lad when we figure the saving in getting out the timber farther inland by dredging a five-foot canal on from the inland water-mark but we are not through yet lad i thought it wise to put an order for one hundred rifles with three hundred rounds each in the requisition and i am sorry from something i saw last night that i did not order them shipped by special steamer from kingston  you saw something last night yes some time about midnight juan waked me and i ran to the window just in time to see two men drop into the dry side of the canal after inspecting the gate and sneak off inland two white men no two mayas and both were armed -rifle pistol and knife peters whistled significantly and then asked well what are you going to do about it just this i am going to leave you in camp to-morrow and i want you to trench both sides of the ridge to defend the gate and to start a timber stockade north side of the camp-timbers that will stop high-velocity subcaliber bullets have the masons build a tank that will hold a thousand gallons of water and put it under cover then dig a cellar in the sand lined with masonry that will hold three or four boatloads of provisions i am going upshore for provisions all the arms in the village and all the fresh water i can float back  adventure why dont you send a messenger to telegraph the governor if there is going to be any trouble   it would take ten days to get a detachment of regionales here and i would rather have twenty of these fishermen than five hundred of those poor convicts half-dead from fever and homesickness also if it is don felipe that is threatening us his cousin is the governor if it is the mayas from the woods-well the government never has been able to get the best of them and i believe i would rather handle the situation myself it was late the next afternoon when imii haskell had his boats loaded and the sun was creeping down in the west the dozen men he had taken with him were waiting at the waters edge to put off and as he stood talking to the aged headman of the village he called out to the boats to proceed with the exception of the lighter and swifter one the sound of horses hoofs at the rear of the village a party of horsemen riding through the gardens scattering the chickens and children don felipe the mercy of heaven cried the old man haskell threw his hand to his hip his gun was in the boat they had not seen him yet he stepped within the doorway saying lie for me father till i can get to the boat oya you old beggar cried calderon y ortegas riding up and taking a playful slash at the patriarch of the village with a freshly cut withe how does it happen that the vultures have not got you yet where are the boys all are working down the shore with the senor haskell don felipe where are those boats going they are taking my children food and water don felipe call them back before i brain you the old man pretended to call in his cracked voice but it was too feeble to carry to the beach so don felipe roared his own mandates the two were already beyond the reach of his voice and the men in the third that waited for haskell showed signs of fear and gave no indication of putting out the haciendado cursed and threatened dire vengeance stopping only to ask is there a girl here or down there with this-american  no don felipe i have seen no women this year but my own children i hear they are cutting down my timber and are digging in my land what is he trying to do i do not know don felipe but he is building things on the sands by the water i shall go down to see evidently the two spies were not don felipes men thought haskell the senor peters says they will soon have ships here loading timber senor peters do i hear your words a lad of little more than twenty the same don felipe he came to my house wounded and grew well here the haciendado ground his teeth in his rage and turning to his elder son said now do you see what we must do and do at once plainly he feared that his attempt to kill young peters having been open and indefensible if peters or haskell were left alive long enough to get in touch with the american consul at merida the governor would be forced to act peering through the wattle-work haskell could see the son nodding his head in acquiescence it seems that we rode over none too soon now bring us the best you have you old dog for we are hungry and then we will go down where these gringo scoundrels are playing in my sand the party dismounted and haskell counted them quickly-don felipe the son and four mozos the mozos had no firearms and the two white men left their carbines slung in rurale fashion on their horses the son carried his heavy pistol in a saddle holster and don felipe had his holster flap buttoned over the pistol at his belt one of the mozos led the horses under a tree and stood them with their heads together untethered the old man seeing they were about to enter the house and knowing that there was no hiding-place within for haskell was trying to divert them by asking don felipe to choose his fowls from those about haskell determined on a desperate course of action don felipe was within three feet of the doorway with his back turned stepping quickly to his side haskell snatched both holster and pistol from his belt and as the bulky haciendado wheeled to face the the mahogany garden  attack drove his fist with terrific force squarely in the center of the repulsive face hurling him back on the son so that both staggered into the midst of the mozos don felipe slipped to the ground bathed in blood trying to get out the pistol as he ran haskell made for the nearest horse the mozos now close on his heels and through surprise he had gained enough lead to leap into the saddle strike the other horses right and left and send them stampeding he galloped through the village shouting to the third boat to put away and make haste to the camp relieved from the fear of don felipes carbine the men pulled away with a will and haskell turned to note the stage of the pursuit one of the mozos was ahorse and another was coming on with speed afoot drawing the carbine and making sure of the charge he checked his horse and fired once-twice-thrice the first shot stopped the runner in a pile in the dust at the third the mounted mozo reeled in the saddle and the american rode on he could not go down the beach to the camp he could only follow the road toward the hacienda until he found a good spot to enter for a detour that would bring him out on the northern edge of the dried marsh which he could follow back to camp chapter ix a prisoner it was very nearly dark when he reached the path he had followed with juan and nunez paola the previous month and as he turned toward the sea he moved with care twice the horse shied and haskell thought he saw dim blurs of white off among the trees once he drew rein and thought of tethering his horse and proceeding on foot on account of the sound of the horses hoofs but laughing at himself for fearing any enemy in this quarter he started to ride on from out the growth on every hand appeared a dozen white shapes two steel rifle-barrels were thrust in his face and strong hands were laid on his horses bits haskell laughed bitterly  good evening amigos what does this mean he asked buenas tardes senor haskell said a familiar voice we were told not to shoot you but you are riding one of don felipes horses and in the dark many things might happen the speaker felt carefully as he spoke for arms other than the pistol and carbine and then turned the horse in the trail who are you cried haskell why do you hold me up this way if you are enemies of don felipe i have just escaped from him in the village he nearly got me where are you taking me   the fool seeks information of the ignorant senor the wise man takes counsel with his own eyes and ears the triteness of the proverb struck an odd note it precipitated haskells own philosophical resignation to this new and astounding development and he drew out a cigar lighted it and in silence allowed himself to be led inland without further protest for a half-hour they marched with surprisingly little noise and then encountered another body of men at least twenty in number moving in the opposite direction and apparently well armed a signal word was exchanged and the two parties passed another hour of silence then the man leading the horseturned aside by a ceifain white barkless tree and after a few minutw difficult passage through the dense growth two men parting the way before the horse they came into an open space and haskell smelled fresh wood-smoke but could see no fire there was also the sound of running water but there was no stream nor a depressed channel for one the man in advance sounded the peculiar note of the canillan bird twice and it seemed to be answered from directly below them a flaming torch appeared almost under their feet a naked maya boy carried it and haskell saw they were on the edge of a great hole forty feet deep and at least one hundred across the boy had stepped forth from a sort of cave at the bottom by the light of the torch the horse was led down a winding trail from shelf to shelf of the sides and wthen the lower level was reached haskell was asked to dismount and saw the horse led away to a second hole in the earth enter senor said the familiar voice and now by the light of the torch the engineer saw that the leader of his captors was nacion from the hacienda his heart sank within until he noted that the other men were of a far wilder type than the mozos of the hacienda  adventure haskell stepped into the cave and saw that it was a water-worn causeway into the earth you can not pass out this door said nacion pointing to the two men who guarded it haskell made the mental reservation that he certainly would do so the first opportunity that was half-way healthful the old channel turned and a strong blast of wood-smoke struck him just as a great sight was revealed before him opened a huge oblong enclosure more than three hundred feet in its greatest dimension the roof of limestone supported in many places by natural pillars of rock and in the light of the fires that glowed here and there moved hundreds of men women children and dogs close at hand was a chasm and at the bottom roared the underground river plainly this had once been its channel on this level but it had broken through to a new one some fifty feet lower leaving an ideal place of concealment for such a band as this-a band of the wild mayas of the forest and their runaway peon recruits most of them had only rudimentary clothes and no weapons but the crooked henequen knives and the straight woodmans machetes and all of these seemed worn cries heralded the arrival of the party and there was a rush from all sides a wall of gleaming bronze bodies serried rows of curious dark eyes formed on either hand in a twinkling and haskell found himself noting the difference between this reception and that which would have been accorded in the village of american blanket indians on the far side of the big chamber some matted vines and cloths had been combined to make screened chambers and to one of these the engineer was conducted to find himself in the presence of an old but erect and virile man sitting on a tiger-skin a fiat earthen dish of fat by his side with a lighted wick thrust in it he was smoking a thick black cheroot and removed it to bow gravely as haskell entered and his captors retired i am nunez jose senor haskell chief of the itzchen-maya i grieve to see you here my brother was sent to save you from one of our oppressors and lead you to the sea that you might leave our country where you have no right you were told to go and told that you could not despoil our forest our last retreat and yet you would not be warned now we must deal with you-not to punish you for we have no right to do so but to protect ourselves against you and all men from your country you are a prisoner and you can not escape because of the bravery you have shown because of the good heart you have shown to our people you are to be a prisoner until we leave this spot and then you must die we can not let you go free we can not be burdened with guarding you you have brought this on your own head for you were fully warned these are the words of a chief you will go now and food will be given you while the old man had been speaking calmly and without feeling haskell had thought of a number of things to say but when he heard his sentence and saw the logic of it from the tribes point of view he realized that it would be hopeless to enter into any argument or to make any appeal the chances were a thousand to one against him but he must take his respite to find that one chance and with the words of dismissal he bowed gravely and turned to leave the chamber almost as if in a dream the whole situation seemed so unreal the curious crowd without had turned away to its own pursuits it being the time of the preparation of the evening meal and haskell stopped to note a woman rolling some beans in a shallow stone mortar with a stone pestle the size of a large grapefruit  senor said nacions voice it is prayed that you follow me threading their way among the merry family groups the two passed leaving the illuminated portion of the enclosure behind until haskell saw before him against the farther wall more of the screening mats and cloths lifting aside the green curtain of one more or less isolated the mozo bowed in the engineer in an earthen vessel used as a brazier glowed fresh coals and on a flat stone at one side were some fresh cakes the odor of which came pleasantly to his nostrils beside them lay some dried meat and near by a leaf laden with fruit and a cool dripping olla carelessly haskell noted that at one side was a rude pallet of boughs and twigs woven so as to make an excellent bed and over it was thrown what seemed a scrape in soft colors encarnacion stood to attend him and thrusting aside all thoughts of the evil lines in which he had fallen he ate heartily the mahogany garden  almost completed was his meal when a gleam of something among the twigs of the narrow pallet caught his eye and reaching over he drew it forth-a little coral and silver beaded rosary with a medallion engraved with emalia rosanna ortegas y escaiendon  the rosary she had worn as she rode to his help nacion he said breathlessly is this the senorita emalias chamber  it is now for you senor and she the senorita will be with my sister on the cake in his hands he now saw the unmistakable print of her little fingers it seemed that the mouthful he had been about to swallow would choke him and sudden surprising hot tears sprang to his eyes he bent his head lest the mozo should see will you bring her nacion he said huskily and when the indian had gone he stared at the coals while between them and his eyes rose the vision of a queenly haughty slip of a girl poised proudly on the steps of the ancicnt hacienda stair the stair at the portal of her ancestral home a rustle of the vines springing to his feet he faced her and noted beyond her the sister of nacion standing with crossed hands and dropped eyes as becomes the duenna the two approached his eyes bent intently on her face in which the color rose and fled in quick alternation her eyes wavering away but coming back constantly to his as if compelled while her fingers tugged childishly at the seams of the sides of her native riding-garb more than two arms length apart they paused and there was a little silence chapter x love and a plea for life oenorita it is strange that we meet  here but it is the blessing of heaven that i see you again at all it is not enough that i twice owe you my life that you have suffered cruelly at the hands of your own flesh and blood to save a stranger that you have even cut yourself off from your home and come to a life among savages is all that not enough that you should seek to thrust on me your poor little comforts and-and with your own hands do for me what there was no one else to do and you are angry senor she quavered the hurt tears in her eyes angry no you beloved child no -only my heart melted within me you were angry with me do you remember i could not help loving you at once angry as you were and now- she had pressed her hands palm to palm on her breast a look of amazed half-incredulous rapture stole over her face at his words and a slow smile of incomparable sweetness dwelt on her parted lips he faltered and moved toward her his hands outstretched eager inquiry and the adoration of a strong man blended in his face why-why little emalia did you do this for me she yielded herself into his arms with a little sigh that caught in her throat almost like a sob and presently she answered because i too have loved you since i first saw you and it was sweeter than anything i have ever done in my whole life to work for you in a little while some flash of remembrance of conventions cut iito the dream of her love and she drew away from him shamefacedly glancing at the patient figure by the door then she laughed merrily i forgot that i had no one to reprove me but myself now i am yours and i may love you as much as i can love and it is all without wrong or your reproof-is it not wholly good the sweet phrases made his heart thrill it is-it is wholly good he answered with reverent earnestness in the light of fresh twigs placed on the brazier they sat and talked of the present situation he took counsel with her as the american does with his wife and true love and she was amazed and proud beyond utterance but when the whole matter had been reviewed she said you should have gone when i told you you should have gone when nacion told you you should have obeyed nunez paola your compania has no right to take these trees and i am sure of it because i know that whoever gave them to my father my grandfather and his father had no right to do so they belong to the itzchen-maya this forest was your fathers how did  adventure it come into the hands of the calderon y ortegas i do not know my uncles told me that it did-that is all i know but it was not right it belongs to these people here in this emote there is no way for you or no help for you beloved you must die they will soon move on-and i will die with you she smiled as if glad that she might haskell shuddered and thought desperately you say that they will move on where are they going he asked they will soon be insurrecto again she answered almost blithely twice since the great war they have risen and each time they were beaten because they did not have enough arms but now all yucatan is with them except a few rich liacienda-dos and when the mexicans are driven out yucatan will be free again all good yuca-tecos admire the mayas but they are not so brave as the men of the forest or they would give them the money for arms they have surrounded your camp to drive you out take you and senor peters captive and kill you because you are going to take the forests and then they wtill march on valladolid killing the maya-hating liacien-dados and taking their arms and horses but not harming the haciendas of the others they will wipe out calderon y ortegas first of all a great light broke on haskell fear of provoking the mayas was what had caused the cunning don felipe who knew the imminence of a rising to repudiate his brothers contract and to discourage the syndicate as he imagined by doing away with its agents as fast as they came in such a way that the murders could not be laid at his door but would be blamed on the mayas rising with sudden resolve he gathered the girl once more in his arms and said you must remain here i am going to talk of this thing to nunez jose and perhaps-wrell when i come back we shall talk more all but a few of the mayas were asleep and studying them with interest as he picked his way among them haskell reached the chamber in which he had confronted nunez jose and encountered the old chief sitting before the door hardly had the american begun to state his extraordinary mission before the chief raised his hand stopped him and sent two boys scurrying to summon his brother nunez paola and all the elders of the tribe not away stirring up the mayas on the plantations it was an hour perhaps before all were assembled in the chamber seated on the ground around the grease-lamp haskell cast his eyes around the circle and with admiration noted the fine features of many the size and intelligence of their eyes and the wisdom written on their brows what a race their forefathers must have been in their heyday at last nunez jose commanded him to speak saying son of strangers speak to the fathers of my children tell the poor remnant of the family of the great serpent the thoughts of thy white mans mind and the wishes of a heart that we know to be brave and strong there is a certain sort of training which encourages the man trained to use a map or to draw as he speaks or thinks and following this impulse haskell stepped to a smooth spot on the white limestone wall and with a piece of rotten yellow stone began to draw while they watched they saw him create an accurate outline of the hook of the north american continent marking in the wilderness and dotting in the towns in the developed and cultivated region the only words spoken while he worked were little exclamations of comment when it was complete he turned and spoke to them clearly pointing out their location showing how they wrere cut off naturally leading on to the conclusion that by the designs of nature the peninsula and the lands east of the mountains were a region unto themselves-the natural heritage of the maya people at this there was approval from every side he passed to the natural wealth of this region and showed how its greatest wealth the hardwoods and the chicle of the forest could be drawn on forever by careful use if the users did not destroy the forest he then entered into the question of territorial rights of the oppression of the mexicans and the pro-mexican haciendados and of the fate of the maya people if they continued to allow themselves to be forced back into the forest or if they submitted to the peonage system and became absorbed in the great body of mexican economic serfs then he spoke of the aztecs the toltecs the tehuantepecs now crushed the mahogany garden  forever and of the yaquis brave fight for three hundred years the thing to do however was not to fight the mexican and his civilization but to return all mayas to the plane of civilization which they once enjoyed and to make the peninsula a maya land once more guerrilla warfare would not do this ravage and pillage would lead to no good ends there was great wealth in the forest and in the uncleared lands that would grow henequen to raise the whole maya people to eminence-if yucatan were all maya i came to your country believing that i had a right to take these trees that right having come through calderon y ortegas and the right is one which the government would enforce with its troops against don felipe and against you but have i sent for troops to come to fight you on the other hand do you not see that if you take my life the government must take extreme measures or my own more powerful country will do so must i explain to you that the men who sent me may not learn the rights and wrongs of things as i have learned them listen to my plan you are not averse to toil if you are well paid i will provide labor and pay for every maya man who will have it we will work together and from the profits a share shall go to the chiefs of the mayas that will soon make a fund that will allow the mayas to come again to their own there is wealth enough for me to keep faith at the same time with calderon y ortegas in a few days my ships will arrive off the coast even now the first may be there and they will have aboard the arms which you need to carry out your plans of driving back the haciendados who have encroached on your lands without rights those arms you may have but if you kill me you can not get them with all this in mind i ask you will you delay your revolution till you are fitted for it-perhaps many years from this time will you confine your insurrection to the punishment of haciendados who deserve it will you work with me in getting out the wealth of these trees without destroying your forest will you enrich yourselves and will you spare my life  there was no question but that the gathering was greatly impressed there was an uncertain silence and then nunez jose signed to haskell that he had better withdraw while they deliberated just before the engineer reached the door a middle-aged man whose face bore a strong resemblance to that of cromwell said we have heard the words of a white man of a stranger one who is not any part of us and has no interest in this land except to despoil it-will he tell us why we should trust him what sympathy he has with this land haskell turned in the doorway fathers of the itzchen-maya as soon as i may i shall wed the senorita ortegas y escalendon a look of surprise one of pleasure apnar-ently passed around the circle and haskell stepped out he had been pacing up and down before the door but a few minutes when he was summoned within my son said nunez jose return tonight to your camp by the sea to-morrow messengers will start to our people in the west and we will await the fulfilment of your promises encarnacion and ten men will go outside and remain with you till you can give us such arms as you do not need it seemed to haskell that a sudden load had been lifted from his heart and when he left the place and crossed to the chamber where he had left emalia he repressed a boyish desire to run she was sitting by the brazier her wealth of hair about her shoulders and she was just beginning to braid it the vessels in which the meal had been cooked and served were cleaned and set in a neat row and there was such a little air of domestication about the almost bare room that he marveled till he saw that it was the visible expression of the spirit that pervaded her brightly as she smiled at the sight of him there was anxious inquiry in her eyes which his very manner answered as he caught her to him and when he told her the outcome of the conference she merely pressed her face close to him and said  almost would i rather that you were to remain here and die than that you were to leave me in keeping with the other new gp emotions that had come to him haskell was surprised to feel the great tug at his heart-strings when he said good-by to her it was not to be for long- only till he could have a fit abode erected for them and until a boat could be sent to cozumel for a priest  adventure she went with him to the entrance of the cenote and watched as far as she could see and haskell called back to her that he would soon return little knowing of all that must intervene chapter xi the siege the moon was up and riding was not difficult about an hour before dawn they were within the sound of the sea after having passed two bodies of the mayas making their way back to the cenote suddenly from the locality of the camp a dozen quick shots sounded one or two wild yells and then silence with a word to nacion haskell put spurs to his horse and the entire party dashed ahead at reckless speed when they came into the open firing broke out again from the ridge to the north of the camp and bullets whistled around them one of the men gave a cry and his bridle-arm fell limp the fire was returned from the camp and to be sure that the men there did not mistake his arrival for an attack haskell began calling to peters and juan galloping madly ahead as he did so soon they were under shelter among the buildings and saw about them in the moonlight a half dozen men crouched under cover at points of vantage armed with a variety of nondescript weapons haskell noted one horse-pistol of the period of maximilian by george haskell cried peters springing up from behind a log where did you come from i thought you wrere done for sure briefly haskell told him what had happened he spoke in spanish so that the men might hear well we have been having a-of a time here old bluebeard did not come around from that punch you gave him till about midnight i suppose but they had sent at once to the hacienda and to two others up the coast for reenforcements and they are just starting in to clean us out with the first arrivals i suppose we are using all the arms we have and i kept twro men to every weapon telling the others to sneak back to the village as they would be no good as targets here and if they were in the village as neutrals and vowed they were unfriendly to us don felipe might not burn their houses or hurt their women and children the scheme must have worked for juan who sneaked in with them and then back with the news i have told you says that the hacienda people did not molest them i believe we are going to have a regular devil-party as soon as it gets daylight i wish i had had sense enough to foresee this before i left the mayas was haskells comment as he turned away to inspect the defenses to think of this going on here and me letting forty armed men pass me bound inland five miles away there had not been time to get the food and water properly stowed and two of the big water-jars were shattered and another pair were pierced with bullets by the time dawn had begun to show haskell was sure of the plan of his defense and three of the men wrho had come with him were in the growth at the foot of the ridge with the useless horses ready to ride back to the cenote as soon as the moon passed under a cloudbank rising in the south now the moment was come and with a faint rustle of the undergrowth and a noise of hoofs that seemed to haskell far louder than it should have been they were off they had reached the point from which haskell first sawr the sea when a sheet of flame burst out of the piles of trap-rock don felipes forces had been sufficiently augmented for him to throw a line completely around the camp down went twto of the riderless horses and in a moment the cavalcade had wheeled and come careering back when half way one of the men reeled in the saddle and fell into a bush where he lay like a rag spread out to dry the loose horses were running free over the upland and the marsh the two mayas bent low and riding hard made for the camp covered by the fire of haskells men one wtent down with his horse on top of him and the other fell into encarnacions arms the man in the bush was struggling to rise but fell back the engineer throwing down his carbine and ripping off his pistol and belt leaped over the low defenses and running bent and zigzagging reached the bush lifted the man out and came staggering in with him while from right and left on the ridge and from the posts inland at least fifty rifles and pistols crackled merrily when he was safe inside with his burden the mayas sent up a wild yell of pride and exulta- the mahogany garden  tion and there was an answer from the line of the enemy three round cheers and a viva haskell maybe they dont know a good thing when they see it said peters refilling his magazine  but i would rather they had yelled loud enough to reach the cars of nunez jose panted haskell it is getting too bright for any man to try to get through on foot jack and there must be a hundred of them out there we have eighteen men seven rifles and nine pistols and will you look up there in the first light two sailboats could be seen coming down the coast the reflected flash of arms showing among the scores of men that crowded them but see here haskell suppose they do kill us off you know there is such a thing as law in this country after all this will make a big muss no jack i have learned that yucateco haciendados stand by each other all that don felipe will have to prove is that i assaulted him disarmed him and nearly killed him and then that i and my men resisted arrest from an entrenched camp the american state department is accustomed to swallowing tales like that if we were british subjects there would have been a gunboat flying the flag of st george in the offing this very minute well what are we going to do about it fight all day long under the burning sun the little band keeping close under cover fired at every movement of the enemy in the bush and every time a rifle spoke after a half-hours stillness a veritable shower of bullets would hurtle over the camp spat against the defenses and throw up little spurts of sand about only three found human targets one of the men from the village had a wound in the shoulder jack peters had the back of his left hand seared and once when the maya who had ridden back wounded raised from his couch in his delirium a bullet coming through the wattle-work had struck him fairly and he fell back his suffering at an end in the early part of the day it was plain that the attacking party was interested in perfecting the investiture but when they attempted to advance they were driven off the bare ridge to the north and south and gradually the main body massed in the thick cover to landward the low bushes of the dried marsh affording excellent cover utilizing the first darkness two swimmers struck out from camp and assembling driftwood up the beach simultaneously started two chains of fire and then swam back safely this was in accordance with a plan of haskells about two hours after sunset he saw that wthat he had foreseen was coming to pass the increasing fire from the landwrard though it wras doing no harm signified an added activity there and an effort to cover some movement direct all your fire to the right was his order gee responded jack peters insub-ordinately  are you going to lei those fellows down there do as they please  wait and see jack wait and seereplied haskell a little after midnight there were whistles and signal-calls from the bush then some shouted orders and with wild yells the mass of the enemy now assembled in the marsh broke into the open dashing forward for a grand assault ilere they come cried peters with a grcn i guess its good-by old man i e was pumping away with his carbine and suddenly stopped short at the sight of hadiell dashing to the sluice-gate and throwing his weight against the levers the tide was nearly at its full height and with a roar the water poured in on the very ground over which the attack was advancing-great yellow overwhelming waves there were wild shouts of triumph and derision from the defenders cries of fear from the hacienda men those in the rear had time to withdraw but the van was caught among the bushes and their own confusion militated against their escape it was not likely that there would be much loss of life save among those who could not swim but their arms went down out of sight in the water by the light of the fires men could be seen struggling in the yellow swirl in the undergrowth and the two americans forebore to fire on them in their helplessness suddenly little old withered juan gave a shriek of joy he had descried something the others had not seen-a bearded man tangled in some vines with the water rising about him into the water up to his armpits went the little man breasting his way  adventure toward the struggler shouting as he went your cripple is coming don felipe your cripple is coming don felipe don felipe heard and struggled the harder tearing free and striking out for the ridge below the gate as the nearest dryland close after him came the little red demon of vengeance and as the haciendado found a footing and turned to face his erstwhile peon juan struck with his henequen blade and the heavy steel sank deep in the neck of calderon y ortegas now they clinched in a death-struggle and rolled over and over together into deeper and deeper water and neither reappeared the cripples debt was paid from far inland came several long blasts as if from a horn and then a burst of shots the itzchen-maya the itzchen-maya cried encarnacion and the men with him and in a few minutes with a roar of hoofs the crackle of rifles and yells of victory they came into view in every direction the hacienda men were in flight and by moonrise the battle was over as the tide receded the joyous defenders flocked to the canal to catch the hats by the dozen that came floating out evidences of the completeness of the rout at dawn haskell put his men to jjtijjjj work to assemble the wrounded and transport them to the village he found pleasure in the small loss of life and turned away with a shudder when the men brought in two bodies-that of a massive bearded man locked tight in the arms of a little withered one the latter with his thin lips drawn back in a fixed smile look senor look cried nacion pointing up the shore haskell turned and beheld a steamer flying a signal and steaming swiftly down the shore at her peak floated the flag of the syndicates shipping lines and when she dropped anchor and a boat put off from her he was overcome with surprise to see standing in the bow scanning the shore and the signs of battle through binoculars -john j peters sr an hour later as they sat over their camp breakfast and haskell had finished his relation of events with jack peters now and then interposing credit where credit was due peters sr said haskell you remember that i told you i was banking on you personally well i guess i win i knew when i got your requisitions that i would and i made a bet with the president i bet ten per cent of the costs against ten per cent of the net on this deal and since i win i turn it over to you clean this up right now and you will be ahead close to two million stay right here on the job i want a day or twto to attend to a little personal matter- uncle john dont you understand that there is a wedding due oh yes of course of course and while i am about it i may as well tell you this land properly belongs to the ortegas heirs anyhow-the calderon brothers flim-flammed them when ortegas died and the future mrs haskell being the last of the family why i shall want to make a new contract with her as soon as she comes to camp you had better send for her at once it was dusk when nunez paola rode down with emalia and the sister of encarnacion and that evening john j peters sr strolled over to the spot where the two stood looking out at the steamer swinging at anchor miss ortegas he said it just struck me that sea captains have power to perform marriage ceremonies how would you like to go aboard to-morrow morning and have it over with and then spend your honeymoon on the colleen bawn while she lies out there this month you see i need haskell here every day now what do you say she blushed rose-red and turned her face away to hide it against
