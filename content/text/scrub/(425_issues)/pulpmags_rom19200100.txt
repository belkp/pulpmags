tiger lure

by t s stribling
a complete novelette

the united rubber company has
a post at taos a structure in old
spanish mission style built of
cemented shells it was once a
mission i believe then a fort and now a
post it stands naked in a furnace of
sunshine in the center of what the mestizos
are pleased to call their plaza that is a
space of ground some fifty yards wide
beaten perfectly bare and hard by
naked feet instead of beaten dusty by shod
ones beyond the plaza the jungle sets in
like the hair on a womans head glossy
lush and fragrant

  on the down-river side of the post is an
arcade that used to be a cloister but now
the natives rent little trading stalls between
the columns and this forms the village
market an odor of stale fish onions
shrimp and chilli pervades the plaza yet
somehow it is not so very disagreeable it
is a kind of scraped-clean dried-out smell
that one meets anywhere in venezuela

  only three persons were in sight when i
piled my traps off the bolunga a ponder-
ous chinese in a flapping shirt concocted
chilli in one of the stalls near him his
brown arawak wife stretched like a cat on
some bags of beans the girls hips were
nearly vertical while her torso was twisted to
a horizontal with the svelt flexibility of
youth the celestial understood perhaps
a dozen words of her arawak she was
part of his furniture a little more or a little
less dear than his pipe

  the third person in the plaza was a

half-breed called jesu diabolo although
that could hardly have been his name
the first thing one noticed about jesu
was his one good eye and a dirty bluish
flap over the shrunken socket of the
other this flap he evidently meant to
accord in color with his single pale pro-
truding ball it produced a queer effect
that pale eye against his leather-colored
face gleaming at me from the shadow of his
sombrero add to this bow legs and the
wide black mustache of a ranchero and there
stands jesu diabolo insultingly to the life

  when he saw my traps put out of the
bolunga he loitered down inspecting them
with his one eye then he shifted it to my
khaki evidently trying to connect me with
my baggage he removed his sombrero
with a grace of which no misfortune de-
prives a south american

  pardon senor do you sell traps he
inquired in spanish

  i shook my head

  senor americano is not a trapper
himself he asked in surprize

  i trap birds i replied in his tongue

  then we are brothers senor he swept
his broad hat in a bow so low that his
bluish flap hung perpendicularly from his
swart face i am a fur-trapper and a
trader i compose an animal scent setlor
absolute kill- these two words he said
in english with a show of pride-and if i
could serve you-

  i followed his smooth spanish with
aversion at that first sight there was

something so repellent about jesu diabolo
that i felt a nervous impatience to be rid
of the fellow as quickly as possible

  if you would direct me to the alcalde
i suggested it would be more than i can
repay

  jesu diabolo indicated the old mission
with another sweep and bow and to my
distaste preceded me

  the alcalde was a small dapper man who
sat dozing at a baized table in the cool dark
interior of the mission the place was a
hotchpotch near the desk in a small
cabinet was the officina correos or that is
the taos post-office big pear-shaped balls
of caoutchouc heaped in one end of the
room was the warehouse of the rubber
company on the desk before the mayor
were some yellow blanks which represented
the companys office here and there
were a few writs and summonses which he
used in his civil capacity on top of this
litter a carafe of water a flask of spirits
some oranges and a battered guitar gar-
nished the alcaldes desk

  the man himself proved a very friendly
and a very curious uttle body in answer
to a string of brisk questions i told my
name and business offered my passport
and inquired for lodgings with a family who
could speak english

  the alcalde picked up a cigarct stub
from the edge of the table

  the only linguist in taos is senor
monan

  jesu diabolo who had picked up the
guitar and touched its strings now muted
them abruptly

  you do not fancy senor monan would
accept a lodger he commented

  the alcalde seemed amused

  all senor lefever can do is to try is it
not jesu senor monans hacienda seems
to encourage perseverance eh

  he winked at me to mark some unknown
joke took a last puff at his cigaret tossed
away the stub and laughed

  you will waste -your time sc ft or dis-
couraged jesu shifting his one good eye to
me

  the alcalde reached for pen and paper

  ill write a little note of introduction
it may help you present this senor
lefever

  he blotted folded and handed it to me

  jesu plainly disapproved but he took
himself off the corner of the table slung the

guitar cord around his neck and indicated
a willingness to direct me to senor monans
we left the alcalde preparing a drink with
his liquor and oranges and smiling to him-
self

  as we stepped from the gloomv interior
the intense sunshine dazzled my eyes
heat reflected from the plaza filtered
through my khaki with a feeling of vermicu-
lation it was the hour of siesta and every-
thing in the square slept the lithe ara-
wak woman lay motionless face down on
the beans her ponderous chinese owner
sat supine amid his pots and blinked at her
through dozing eyes on the side of the
wall a green lizard slept in an ecstacy of heat
in this land of ascians we trod on our
shadows splotches of ultramarine which
dyed our feel and legs in its color

  jesu lead the way his bare soles made no
sound on the hard paths that meandered
from hut to hut in the jungle we passed
perhaps a dozen thatched cabins here
and there a dog or a child slept of all
taos only we two moved

the half-breed talked at first but
presently swung his guitar about and
began strumming its strings from
simple chords he evolved a plaintive
melody that presently shaded off into the
beat and insistence of negroid music then
he embroidered his theme with spanish
flourish and bolero his aria i think
suggested words for he began singing
softly at first then after a phrase or two his
voice arose to a silver power that astonished
me he appeared to forget that i followed

  a fancy came to me that perhaps he was
singing so loudly and so passionately to
reach the ears of some sleeping girl in one of
the huts the music distressed me it was
too suggestive loo lickerish to be sung by
one man in the presence of another it
gave my distaste for the fellow a greasy
flavor

  after a while the song stopped suddenly
we had come to an open space in the rank
vegetation and now jesu swung his guitar
out of the way and stepped aside to let me
pass

  sefior monan lives yonder he pointed
toward a copse of palms you will see
his house when you pass into the cleared
space he looked at me queerlv then
added i hope senor you catch vour
bird

romance

  i paused hardly knowing whether to
offer pay or not when i made a slight
movement toward my pocket he stiffened
visibly and i let it pass i thanked him
briefly ungraciously perhaps glad to be
rid of him jesu like his song was too
chromatic for a white mans taste

  i moved into the open field with a re-
lieved feeling and paused to look at senor
monans house it was a sprawling se-
quence of adobes sun-washed with walls
punctured here and there by narrow barred
windows the field around about was
planted with aisles of moriche palms
which furnish the natives with wine bread
rope cloth what not

  as i stood observing my prospective
lodgings a queer thing happened i heard
an insect-like drone and something tipped
my sun-helmet i reached up to brush
away some beetle or other and discovered a
little nick in the rim of my helmet i
removed the hat and looked at the place
puzzled

  i still stood with my finger in the nick
when in the distance diabolo began singing
again i listened and looked until his
voice faded to nothing and the vast silence
of the siesta once more comprehended
taos then i walked down a wide palm
aisle toward the adobe

  when i pulled the bronze lions foot in
senor monans iron-grilled door a gong
clashed inside and lost itself in a vibrating
hum after a period of lifelessness came a
shuffling approach from the inside and the
clatter of bars lowered then a panel in
the heavy door slid back and discovered an
ancient shriveled negress with a huge key
which she applied to a corresponding sec-
tion of the grille

   as she opened it i drew out the alcaldes
note to her master to my surprize she
did not even glance at me or my letter but
began exerting her feeble strength to re-
close the iron bars apparently her duty
began and ended with the opening and
shutting of the panels i stepped inside
with a queer sense of swinging aboard a
passing train even then the ancient
appeared not to observe my entrance
which brushed her dirty skirt but contin-
ued automatically relocking the bars

  for a moment i watched her and then
turned to my surroundings the hall was
large cool and poverty-stricken with
time-stained touches here and there remi-

niscent of luxury a portiere of faded silk
half curtained one end of the passage a
painting in a tarnished gilt frame hung from
the wall a rose jar with fresh roses per-
fumed the passage and suggested a woman
two silver-chased dueling swords crossed
above a door which i guessed led into some
ancient salledes amies

   this last surmise was verified by a man
stepping out from under the weapons
holding in his hands a carbine which he
appeared to be cleaning he was a thin
nervous man with a worn-out face in which
burned inquisitorial eyes for a moment
he regarded me with an embarrassing
scrutiny i held out my note a little
awkwardly i am afraid and began an
explanation in english i told him i
wanted to trap birds in taos for an ornitho-
logical institution and that i had been
directed to him as the only english-speaking
citizen in taos

   the senor smiled dryly then deprecated
accepting a guest in what he called his
poverty-stricken ruins he used english
without accent but with that rigid gram-
matical structure noticeable among culti-
vated foreigners

  i insisted that his thick adobe walls
would be a great boon to a man from
northern latitudes if he could spare me a
room

  he interrupted with a gesture it was
not lack of rooms he could offer me a
suite of rooms but-he paused with some
serious objection i believe on his lips but
finally turned it into a fear that i would
find time dull on my hands among his
sprawling adobes i assured him i had
not come to venezuela for distraction then
our conversation drifted to birds and finally
he asked me how i had found my way to the
hacienda i told him a half-breed called
jesu diabolo had guided me

   for some reason this seemed to allay a
faint suspicion of me that still lingered in
the back of my hosts mind he nodded

   yes i heard jesu diabolo singing when
you entered my clearing and from this
distance i thought you were he however
as you did not dodge back into the jungle

i	knew i was mistaken

   when i did not dodge back i accented
mystified

  when you did not dodge back re-
turned the don noncommitally

  he replaced the carbine in a stand of

by t s strblng
l   	romance -

arms a barred window just above the
stand was as narrow as a loop-hole as
he put back the firearm i observed a
maxim silencer affixed to the carbines
muzzle

  then a tentative and ghastly connection
played through my mind between the fact
that jesu had some cause to dodge and the
silencer and the droning buzz that had
nicked my helmet i looked at senor
monan curiously but found a difficulty in
opening the topic a moment later he
led the way for me to make choice of what
rooms i would occupy

ii

i have no object in making of
senor monan a mystery although
for several days he was a mystery to
me but no man i take it can remain
permanently without a confidant men
have been gregarious for too many millions
of years he has communicated his thoughts
ancfc emotions for too many epochs for any
individual in this era of grace to place a seal
upon his heart

  during the evenings senor monan and
i played at cribbage or dominoes and some-
times his daughter lwanna sat in our
games or made lace near us at another
table very slowly the senor began to
unfold himself a little bit at a time until
within perhaps a week of evenings i dis-
covered why he had hesitated to receive me
into his home-an extraordinary thing
amid the uniform hospitality of venezuela

  senor monan-was implicated in some sort
of political trouble in caracas an emeute
an uprising i never understood the details
his followers had lost and now any day he
was expecting arrest and a long imprison-
ment or even severer punishment i had
known that venezuela was one of the most
unquiet of south american states but it
seemed odd in this somnolent village to
find an insurrectionist before this fiasco
it seemed he once held a consulship to
england now he confined himself to
this plantation of moriche walks which
belonged to a friend in caracas and where
he hoped to escape suspicion and elude
arrest

  the senor explained all this with the
detachment of  third person but lwanna
al ter the manner of weeping girls wiped her
black eyes on the least possible corner of

her handkerchief that would serve then
silently went on with her lace-making

  at other times i saw lwanna in the patio
snipping roses for her jar or trying to make
friends with the butterflies an endless
variety of these insects floated over the
adobe into the flower plot heliconias
silver-wings and half a dozen other species
i did not know once i saw her persuade
a brilliant blue morphos to poise on the tip
of her finger and suck a drop of honey

  she was but a child on the dewy side of
sixteen and her face sometimes i think
catholic mothers when praying to the
holy virgin with their tiny ones asleep
beneath their hearts-i think maybe the
grace of our lady of sorrows must be
kissed upon those dawning features i dont
know but standing in my window i have
laid down the snares and gins of my pro-
fession and tried to explain so vivid and so
pure a loveliness

  the avi-fauna of venezuela opened a
larger field to me than i had expected
it contains fifty-odd species of humming-
birds alone one day as i was constructing
some close-meshed cages to receive my
catch of these exquisite little creatures
senor monan and lwanna came into my
workshop

  the girl watched me curiously and finally
asked me how i caught the birds i
explained the different traps snares limes
and nooses as she considered each article
she pressed her full lips together and with a
little shudder declared that they reminded
her of the racks and thumbscrews and
pillories in the museum at caracas and that
she would look at them no more

  she would have left the room but her
father reminded her that she was my
hostess and i her guest she remained a
few moments longer looking about my
shop with such an air of repressed horror
that it embarrassed me in mv work
finally she made some excuse and went out
into the patio

  seflor monan was distressed over the
slight occurrence

  i suppose i am to blame for it he told
me when lwanna was a tiny thing she
wanted a bird and a cage i explained to
her the cruelty-i mean the cruelty it would
have been for pleasure he corrected
tactfullynot cruelty for scientific purposes
i suppose she remembers it then he
added her great grandfather on my

mothers side was simon bolivar some-
how our family have never been able to en-
dure prisons or prisoners 

  with the completion of the cages i
began collecting specimens a remarkable
trapping-ground lay before me in the jungle
around senor monans palm walks birds
were everywhere they ranged from little
tyrant fly-catchers that snapped mosquitoes
along the pathside to flocks of flamingoes
moving in a red line against the green wall
of the distant jungle yellow cassiques and
lavender jays glinted among the palm
crests macaws toucans parrakeets
screamed through the forest yet with this
fullness of life i was strangely unfortunate

   i laid a course of traps extending from the
riotigre some mile and a half back into the
jungle twice a day i made the round-in
the cool mornings and afternoons after
trapping two days without a specimen i
began to wonder seriously what was wrong
with my gins one morning i reset them
very carefully and determined to revisit
them at noon notwithstanding the oppres-
sive heat

so after luncheon during siesta

i slipped away from the sleeping
household and set out for the river

i was almost to the waters edge when i
saw something brilliantly red moving slowly
through the undergrowth i hurried for-
ward as quietly as possible slipping through
lianas bamboo and saw grass when i saw
through an interstice that it was jesu
diabolo carrying in his hand the wings of a
scarlet ibis he was just stepping into a
native bungo to put out into the river but
at my call he looked about and waited

   when he caught sight of me struggling
through the vines he lifted his sombrero

   i was just thinking of you senor

   you ought to be i declared suddenly
understanding the disappearance of my
catch

  how go the birds he asked impu-
dently

   fast enough i returned looking point-
edly at the flaming wings in his hands

  do you catch a great many his
assurance made me angrier even- moment

   more than i collect i snapped

  perhaps something robs your traps
senor he suggested with composure

   looked at the fellow wondering how
much further he would carry his effrontery

 wthat price do you get for ibis wings

 i asked trying to keep the temper out of
 my voice

 he glanced negligently at the beauties
 in his hand

 five pesos

 to me i said smoothly they are
 worth twenty-five pesos and a living
 scarlet ibis is worth a hundred pesos in
 the future my good jesu if you will kindly
 leave my birds in my traps ill pay you
 your five pesos as a bounty or tax or black-
 mail whatever you please to call it-but
 let my birds alone

 i hardly know what i expected jesu
 diabolo to do but he surprized me by
 laughing immoderately until tears dripped
 down the side of his nose from his one good
 eye

 ah you american wits he gasped
 such dry jokes such droll sayings i

 have heard how amusing you were but

 i never thought i n-never d-dreamed-

 he sputtered into laughter again then
 presently sobered and continued

 unfortunately senor it would do you
 no good to pay me blackmail or tariff or tax

 i cut these wings from a bird which i used
 to bait a camoudie trap by this time he
 had become entirely sober and now looked
 at me with his habitual craft suppose
 i go around with you i might suggest
 something a skunk or a sloth or a lynx
 may rob your traps a tree-trap might
 stop them

 now i did not want the fellow with me
 at all but that lying amenity which society
 instills into all of us caused me to stay my
 steps for him and we went on together

 as we pushed our way through the
 steaming undergrowth he told me that for
 some time he had intended to call upon me

 it would be agreeable to you he
 proceeded delicately if i should take the
 liberty of calling	 

 charmed i agreed out of custom

 diabolo turned to look at me with his
 one pale eye

 will you really admit me senor

 why-y-yes i assented in surprize

away some gnats that gathered about his
 dirty flap sefior monan iires at me
point-blank the moment i appear within
range of his mansion he is an unsocial
fellow bah

     the half-breed shrugged his shoulders
   with latin carelessness

     with a crawly feeling i recalled the
   maxim silenccr and the little nick in my
   helmet i wondered if on my first day in
   taos jesu had led me deliberately under
   fire i turned and stared at the mans
   queer face with its detestable bluish flap
   it reminded me of a rattlesnake that had
   moulted everything except an eye-scale

     why is monan so pointed in his dis-
   couragement of your society i inquired
   at last

     the diabolo shrugged again

     merely because i tried to steal his
   daughter sefior that is all it is a custom
   among my mothers people the arawaks
   we steal our wives and a fine custom it
   is sefwr swift dramatic the ambush the
   sudden rush

     you-tried to steal lwanna i cried
   with a slack jaw

      such a voice exclaimed the half-breed
    impatiently i was not trying to steal a
    dog or a pig or a bird wing sefior nothing
    of value he defended sharply

      but lwanra i cried with a sinking
   heart why man shes but a child
   child scoffed jesu madre de dios
   what would you call a woman-one in the
   grave she is sixteen- he whistled
   she ought to be a grandmother

      there was an ophidian fascination in the
    half-breeds face as he went on

      i would be a good husband to the little
    pantheress but no-this proud don-no
    he is angry if i woo her as the arawaks
    and behold he will not allow me to woo her
    as spaniards do if i sing a song in her
    hearing out he jumps with his rifle like a
    jack-in-the-box as to talking through the
    bars of her window i might as well talk to
    the stars he clenched his slender brown
    hands in nervous tension unless-un-
    less-

the sefior explained alt

   his voice retreated to a dry whisper even
in the silence of the sleeping jungle

tt suddenly struck me as i
 stared at him that a serpent
crawling toward a doves nest is
moved by no immoral impulse it acts
from a simple powerful desire without any
complication of conscience to jesu dia-
bolo obtaining lwanna was no more a
queslion of morals than plucking a mango
she was difficult to reach that was all

   yet queer to say his unmorality filled me
with a greater loathing than if he had
shown a comprehending contumacy but
he was as irtnocent as a dagger

  i dont know what-perhaps something
about the pallor of my face my unsteady
breathing suggested to the half-breed that
i sympathized with him in his mania or
perhaps jesu diabolo like senor monan
was a lonely man isolated from his kind by
the ridicule of the village at any rate
through clay-colored lips the indian began
a molten outpouring in my ear

  dios one mistake sefior one little
mistake and a man regrets it forever i
lie awake all night when the moon is full
thinking of what might be if i only had her
if only i had clung to her when i gripped
her in my arms oh she could spit in my
face stab me bum me with fire-

   little dropfs of sweat stood out on jesus
face and moistened the edge of his bluish
flap so that he had to shake off the gnats
his face was gray

   senor he went on and the force of his
heart-beats shook his tones when a man
loses the greatest quarry of all he thinks of
it forever he thinks how he might have
saved his game might have won over
and over i think just how i did it-how i
ought to have done it

  every night as i lie staring into the
moon i creep again- into senor monans
house the sefior is gone but she is there
in the patio cutting flowers oh senor
lifting her white arms this way and that
i creep creep-leap upon her i grip her
in my arms soft writhing a tigers cub
smellingof roses

  oh madre de dios i am drunk i
rush for the outside the old negro
woman blocks my way with an ax then i
make my terrible mistake i lift an arm to
parry the edge like a flash she is out of
my arms gone-gone-gone-into a door

that locks when it slams then another
slamming locking slamming locking-no
end of rooms in the cursed place

  sweat poured off jesu diabolo he
gripped a tembuse vine and shook it in a

furv of despair crying

  fool fool fool to lose her in an
instant the old woman could only have
split a shoulder or a few ribs-

  as i watched his oulburst never have i
felt such violent hatred for any of the
spawn of the earth a furious impulse to
murder him seized me i searched my
pockets with shaking fingers i found my
pocket-knife it was sizable i had it out
i fumbled open the blade

  suddenly jesu who was looking at nu
intently gave a queer laugh then he
laughed more he sat down by the tem-
buse vine and laughed loudly and sardon-
ically

  quite suddenly he checked his uproar and
asked-

   what are you going to trim sefior

   i made no reply

  that was an arawak joke seftor he
explained looking at my knife i am-half
arawak and half spanish this time i
jest like the arawaks about a woman-the
woman sefior loves eh

  he winked his good eye at me with
monstrous effect

  i stared at him with hammering heart

  did you not jest with me about stealing
these wings he inquired placidly very
funny very droll now i give you my
arawak jest about your woman eh
he stood up shrugged took a deep breath
and said now where are the traps
seftor

   his lie was so absurd i thought before i
killed him i would show it io him to his
teeth

  why does senor monan fire on you at
sight jesu diabolo i whipped out

  jesu opened his single pale eye in as-
tonishment

  he doss not shoot senor lefever

  i jerked off mv sun-helmet and thrust it
into his hands

  how came that nick in the straw 
could scarcely keep from leaping on him

  he examined the chipped place with
passing interest ran a finger over the raw
edge then observed carelessly-

  moths senor camphor and ppper are
good

  thats a bullet-hole from sefior monans
carbine jesu diabolo i cried growing
more angry at his flimsy tissue of lies
and you did attempt to kidnap lwanna
how absurd defended the half-breed
he would have the law on me in a moment
kidnap-why i should be garroted

  the sefior has good enough reasons for
keeping away from the law i replied hot-
ly or he would have-

  i know very little of senor monan
declared jesu if he is criminal-is he
criminal

  i could have bit my tongue for giving the
information now i had more incentive
than ever to stab him but for that very
reason-it is difficult to explain-because
my motives were mixed and so in a way
were selfish because i now had two im-
pulses one weighing against lhe other
my vengeance became impossible

  i think jesu sensed the dilemma goring
in my brain for he whistled a phrase of his
detestable song shrugged his shoulder
again and at last made a placating move-
ment and said in a commonplace tone-
if the sefior will show me his snares i
will set my traps and protect him

i marveled at the lightness with
which he came back to easy footing
we stood in the edge of a little savanna
near a pau darco tree in which i had set
a number of fine cat-gut snares the trunk
of the giant with its network of vines and
shoots formed an easy climb i indicated
a tree caught hold of a liana and began
working my way up through the furry
leaves

  odd to say the last of my snares were
unset i reformed their loops with an
irritated thought of monkeys below i
could hear jesu carelessly jingling his traps
or breaking little twigs awaiting my de-
scent after a bit he hushed these slight
noises a thought of treachery fluttered
through my brain i maneuvered for an
opening in the leaves and peered down

  the half-breed knelt intently studying
the choked area around the base of the
pau darco as i looked he pressed apart
some vines and exlubited a few sticks a
handful of withered flowers fallen from a
stalk above and some clods of fresh earth
he lifted oie of the stickswhich some liana
tendril had bound to another in a rude
cross and stirred the clay with it he

by t s str i blinc
squatted stifdying stirring brushing au-
tomatically at the gnats around his flap
with the ibis wings

  by this time i was descending not ten
feet above his head

  what is it i inquired looking down
suspiciously

  nothing senor he jingled his traps
again

  i swung to the ground and reached the
spot he had been examining with vague
distrust i thrust my toe into the fresh
earth and upturned it there exposed lay
the turquoise and ruby body of a peacock
heron

  what sort of scamp are you i
snapped out of temper youve ruined
the feathers now it will do neither of us
any good

  senort the half-breed deprecated my
anger

  at that instant a tremendous black
beetle with formidable trefoil pincers scut-
tled out of the disturbed earth with a dry
rustling

  ah that explains it senor a coroner
beetle he cried whatever robbed your
snares dropped this dead bird and the
beetle buried it a pity to lose it- he
stared at it in a deep reverie-a great
pity-such bright feathers

  with a trappers instinct to leave no
sign he musingly recovered the body with
earth and tossed back the withered blos-
soms and crossed sticks he picked up
his traps again and began climbing the
pau darco

  ill stop this robber for you senor
lefever tomorrow you may expect your
gins full of birds and perhaps some minx
or monkey will be in my trap you take
your game and i mine eh we work well
together

  i nodded and jesu went up as nimbly as
a chinchilla in a short time he came
down wished me luck and took himself off
toward the river

   for some reason i had little heart to go
further on my rounds an unwonted
depression crept over me perhaps it was
a nervous reaction after my anger at any
rate i was disgusted with myself and my
traps indeed all at once my very occu-
ition seemed puerije and ridiculous-a
jjer what difference between me

and the half-breed he pandered to the
vanity of women and i to the intellectual
vanity of men both appeared utterly
futile why this endless empty study of
birds did a slowly accumulating catalog
of facts lead anywhere indeed did mans
whole life and works have any significance
at all the thought stretched out and out

  what excuse had man for all his tremen-
dous pride what real difference was there
between me and jesu diabolo and the
gaudy heron in the mold or even the coro-
ner beetle laying its eggs in the dead meat
were we not all little vital mechanisms
evolved with prodigal purposelessness by
the steaming painted jungle around us

  a prodigious golden note clanged against
my ears it filled the humid air the end-
less aisles of the trees and the wide reach of
the sky with solemn reverberations slow-
ly argently came the sound chime on
chime billows of euphony it suggested
a solemn carillon in gothic spire a solitary
worshiper in the fevered jungle

  the first sound turned me into a keen
ornithologist again i followed the sound
searching everywhere with eyes and ears
for half a mile i stumbled crawled and
climbed then i saw a sight which set my
heart pounding

  on a branch of a brazil tree perched a
snow-white bell-bird or as the natives call
it the arapunga this was the eagerly
sought object of my whole adventure i
did not disturb the singer but marked its
location then with endless labor i re-
traced my steps to the pau darco carried
all of jesus traps to the brazil tree set
them and spread a thick lime on every
limb in my reach after that t dragged
myself home utterly exhausted but filled
with a new professional enthusiasm

ill

that night all night long thoughts
of jesu diabolo scurried through my
brain like rats i lay in a half sleep at
one moment i could see him creeping upon
lwanna while i sweated helpless in the
grip of a nightmare at another time we
would stand quarreling furiously whether
she were woman or child then i would
twitch wide awake with the question still
in my mind

  was senor monans daughter a woman

tiger lure
romance

after all was she-was she some pro-
found interest seemed to balance on the
answer

  at last in hope of shaking off such fan-
cies i got up anc walked across the chill
tiled floor to the window from the patio
a smell of damp earth and flowers drifted
through the bars outside in a faint star-
light two lunar moths spiraled monoton-
ously about each other appearing and van-
ishing in the gloom of a geranium tree for
several minutes i stood inhaling deeply
hoping to induce sleep when a light glowed
in a window across the patio i blinked at
it wondering sleepily who had lighted it
when the shadow of a womans arm crossed
the curtain

  it was odd how that hint of a woman
brought me wide awake alert in an in-
stant indeed i found myself waiting
almost breathlessly for its reappearance

  as i waited i became sure for no reason
in the world that the light came from
lwannas chamber a dozen queries be-
seiged my heart was she ill or lonely or
unhappy that she arose at such an hour
did the languid night tease her into rest-
lessness as it did me or did she keep
some vigil of her faith

  a sudden strange impulse a sympathy-
yes a sympathy moved me to call across
the patio and acquaint the girl with my
own wakefulness i hardly knew what i
would say my heart beat with queer
excitement i drew a trembling breath and
framed her name on my lips at that
moment the candle was snuffed out

  a hazy purple spotch floated before my
eyes where the light had been then i
heard a grating door across the patio softly
open and close

  an extraordinary impulse sent me flying
without second thought to my own bed-
room door which gave upon the court
my hand bungled a nervous interval at the
latch i swung the door open in silent vio-
lence and stepped outside some one half-
crouched in the opposite entry i was well
across the court my heart knocking at my
nbs when i recognized the crooked form of
the negress angela

  so strong upon me was the impression
  wannas passing i came near seizing
  e ancient and demanding where her mis-
  res ad gone when i realized angela was
  one t was the old crone who had opened

the grating it was the shadow of her witn-
ered arm i had marked upon the curtain

  the revulsion set me shivering then
somehow the irony of the tiling brought
relief to my overwrought nerves i laughed
sardonically but the wrinkled creature paid
not the slightest attention to my mirth
then i stood smiling and at last musing on
the hag to whom  had poured my emo-
tion and yet i reflected in her time in
her little flash of youth no doubt my
grimalkin had her quota of lovers dancing
attendance upon her spending white nights
outside her hut perhaps fighting for her
favor-if only they could rise now and see
this huddling rack of bones   

  a morning chill sent a shiver over my
body then i noticed a pale illumination
filled the patio somewhere a cock broke
into a shrill crowing it was too late for
bed again so with a yawn and a somewhat
ironic good morning to angela i set
out for my traps in the breaking dawn

  when i made my way through the palm
walks and reached the edge of the river
i was not surprized in the least to see
jesus bungo lying in the reeds

  as i stood looking at the clumsy boat i
grew ashamed that i had contracted the
slightest partnership with lwannas at-
tempted abductor i promised myself the
next time we met i would break off all
intercourse with him as i thought on it
my wrath grew and i vowed if he over-
stepped the least form i would kill him out-
right it was a queer twist of civilization
that i must wait for some petty second
offense before i could kill him for his first
inflamed attack

  i was chewing on this formality when a
noise ahead brought me up sharply by
way of jungle caution i stepped behind a
huge caladium and stood peering between
the leaves in an effort to locate the
disturbance

  what i saw astounded me jesu dia-
bolo tramped amid the undergrowth bend-
ing low to search the ground and making
short casts back and forth like a hound at
fault apparently he was trailing some-
thing

  for a full minute i stood quite at loss to
account for his actions when i suddenly re-
membered having moved the fellows traps
no doubt he had gone to the pau darco
had missed the traps and according to his



by t s stribling
romance

nature had leaped at the conclusion that
i had stolen them now he was trying to
follow my yesterdays trail and recover his
property	

  his suspicions filled me with disgusted
amusement and at the same time offered
me an opportunity to insult the fellow and
have done with him at once i was on the
eve of discovering myself when he paused
drew an old brass watch from his pocket
and consulted it he stood a moment
chewing his black mustache and calculating
the time painfully then took himself off
toward the river

  i was so surprized at this denouement i
did not hail him at all never before had
i seen an indian carry a watch or pay the
slightest attention to the flight of time i
could not fancy why he should give up
looking for his traps on a certain hour if
there were a mortal unhurried by the few-
ness of minutes to the hour that mortal
surely was jesu diabolo

presently i gave up the slight
conundrum and made my way to
the brazil tree all along the course i
saw signs of jesus reckless search tram-
pled undergrowth crushed clumps even to
the tree where i had placed his traps

  when i observed this i stood smiling at
how close he had come to his quest and yet
had missed it when my ear caught a flut-
tering high up in the boughs my limed
twigs had snared something

  i craned my neck and moved about
under the branches trying to locate my cap-
tive above me the brazil tree stretched
skyward chamber on chamber the nearer
leaves looked dark and polished but far
above they shaded into bluish-green masses
at last i glimpsed the tremulous wings of
my catch they were white wings i
peered more closely almost incredulously
it was a bell-bird-no-yes my heart
began to thump it really was a bell-bird

  i counted the limbs upward to my bird
for a man can get lost in one of those huge
trees as easily as in a skyscraper then i set
about my climb by good fortune a span-
ish arbor made a long reach from the
ground to the first branches and beyond
that my way was easy

  spanish arbor is a species of morning
glory and at this hour its pied goblets
formed a flowery mass just above the first

branches i gripped the vine tested it with
my weight which set all the glories in a
stir then i started up hand over hand

  beneath the first branch i paused a mo-
ment for breath when i observed a con-
tinued stirring in the flowers above me
it was near my trap i paused thinking
perhaps a bush-master or a sloth was in
jesus trunk-trap and i had no stomach
for a nipped finger i climbed on cautious-
ly when out of the blossoms arose a head
a girls head-it was lwanna

  i came within a squeak of loosing all
holds and falling twenty feet to the ground

  the girl stared at me with horror-
widened eyes then slowly she seemed to
recognize me she gave a wavering cry

  oh senor is it you is it you and
she fell to sobbing convulsively with her
arms thrust up awkwardly among the
flowers

  for full ten seconds i hung dazed star-
ing at her listening to her sobs the vine
making slow half-revolutions under my
weight

  scnorita i finally gasped

  s-senor wont you p-please let me
out she swallowed her tears

  let you out i echoed blankly

  senor if you only will i never never
never will turn your birds loose again

  what are you in i cried in amaze-
ment

  oh you know she cried with a de-
spairing face and tried to pull her arms
from the tree

  with a shock i remembered my traps

  you dont mean youre caught i
cried scrambling up on the limb

  si senor she quavered pulling with
an agonized movement

  and she was indeed caught in the trap
her arms were chafed and contusions
ringed her wrists where the teeth bit oh
it was pitiful-pitiful even for a man but
for a woman-such a woman

  what amazed what terrified me was jesu
diabolos infernal cunning the moment
he had seen the dead peacock heron with
the little cross and flowers over its grave
he knew lwanna had biried it from this
he guessed the girl must make the round of
my snares before i did liberating my cap-
tives so he had planned instantly to set his
tree-trap and catch her that was the
secret of his beating about in the jungle

iz

tiger lure
r o mance

like a madman he was searching for
lwanna that was why he had timed
my arrival with his disreputable watch
allowing himself time to escape before my
regular appearance in order to avoid me

  when i thought if on the preceding day
i had not heard the arapunga belling and
had not moved his traps to another tree

    if he had found her   

  i moved down the limb to her slid my
hands down her arms among the flowers
and wrenched open the steel jaws then i
picked her up as if she had been a child

  in my arms the girl seemed to have no
weight at all indeed she seemed scarcely
flesh and blood but all lightness flowers
and perfume and something infinitely dear

  her hair came unbound and fell over my
shoulder and breast in a jetty rose-scented
torrent she was dizzying when i real-
ized what i was doing i found myself ca-
ressing comforting kissing her lips beg-
ging her not to think i had set traps for her

  and with it all something in the back of
my head a fragment of sanity i think
seemed to stand off in profound surprize
for it had discovered that jesu diabolo was
right in his argument after all it was no
child clinging passionately and breathlessly
to me pressing her lips to mine pressing
her bursting heart to mine

  it seemed to me all the loneliness and
craving of my whole life was concentrated
and satisfied in an instant i believe if
heaven should have opened-but there is
no use talking over such things between
men she said she had loved me ever since
i walked to her barred door against the
muzzle of her fathers gun it was foolish
drunken ecstatic talk

  we were almost frightened at the web of
coincidences that had woven our lives to-
gether what if a single strand had
broken if i had not been sent from new
york to taos if her father had not been
exiled from caracas if i had not met jesu
diabolo and the alcade if her father had
aimed an inch truer even if she had not
been caught in the trap it is amazing to
think on what frail chances men and wom-
en meet and mate and people the world

the broad branches of the brazil tree
tempted lwanna and me to stay
aloft long after her arms had recovered
from the bite of the trap the vines made

a natural hammock where we could loll
and watch the butterflies and birds float
in and out among the foliage somewhere
above us a woodpecker gave a long joyful
roll a wild sow followed by four little
striped pigs came grunting under our
retreat

  it was strange that the jungle which
only the day before had seemed a sort of
hideous gorgeous mill grinding out vital
machines now appeared suffused with a
delirious joy of living i think the very
plants had their loves the vines embraced
the trees the winds caressed the grass the
orchid trembled for the bee with lwan-
na in my arms j sensed why blossoms
burst in perfume and fruited

  i found the girl oddly intimate with the
jungle about her near the ground she
pointed out a sort of bane that would keep
ferrets from stealing chickens a little
later an agouti hopped out of the vines at
the base of our brazil tree and she assured
me our sky-scraper must be hollow for
these little animals only lived in hollow
trees by way of experiment i pushed a
stick into the vines where we sat and really
found a cavity up there

  the agouti stared up at us with black in-
quisitive eyes and perhaps decided we
were harmless for it paid no further atten-
tion but nipped grass and girdled a little
sapling quite unconcerned about its audi-
ence presently it left off its play or labor
stared bright-eyed into a thick bank of
ferns after a moment it stamped its hind
foot on the ground popped into the
spanish vines and disappeared

  something alarmed it smiled lwanna

  i glanced into the ferns looking per-
haps for a lynx or a python and indeed
caught the glint of an eye

  i pointed it out and we both looked in
warm carelessness trying to decipher the
rest of the animal against the gloom when
close beside the eye i made out a dirty
bluish flap

  there are no words for the fury that
swept over me i shouted jesu diabolos
name flung myself on the vine and to the
earth when i touched ground i saw him
crashing through the bushes and tangle
i charged after him as i rushed i roared

  you hell-hound you dog of a devil
set a trap for a girl

  thorns stabbed me and broke off in my

flesh i burst through lianas the half-
breed was a brown shadow it seemed he
must get away when his foot turned on an
oozy lily-pad i was nearly eight feet be-
hind he was struggling to get up when i
jumped headlong through a screen of air
vines one hand caught his shirt he tore
loose my other grabbed a flying ankle
he fell full length kicking furiously

  somehow i pushed my head and shoul-
ders up into his threshing legs when i
got my head past his buttock he twisted
up and looked at me i thought the mans
eye would pop out he wriggled beat
squirmed to keep my hand from his neck
i crawled up over him as powerfully as if
i had eaten strychnine when my fingers
closed about his glottis he screamed and
ended in a queer squawk he flung out his
arms seized two handfuls of weeds and
struck me in the face

  instantly a fiery blindness blanketed me
nettles blistered my face and flamed in my
eyes swords darted through my head
for a moment i wasstunned out of action
in that moment he slipped out of my arms
next instant i was up my head in flames
blindly chasing his sounds i stormed
through thorns briars rebounded from
boles always lcould hear his feet just in
front of me then i plunged into water
up to my waist fell down got up dripping
and perforce came to a stand then i
heard jesus voice some little distance
further out pant

  senor how absurd i set a trap for the
sen or it a i did not even know where it was
you put it up the brazil tree yourself
jesu diabolo sat his bttngo some thirty
feet from the bank quite out of danger his
boat drifted gradually in the slow current
you knew she buried that heron you

knew if you-

  the utter futility of upbraiding such a
creature stopped me i looked at him
through clearing eyes

  i am going to kill you jesu diabolo
i said soberly

  why senor he asked almost politely
for setting that trap for spying on
me and miss monan i shouted

  senor does not a man visit his traps
twice a day inquired diabolo with a
certain righteousness of defense

  at that moment i observed something
that looked like the knotty end of a log

drifting down the current in toward where
i stood

  i quietly backed out of the water to
safety among the reeds on the edge of the
river the nose of the cayman sank si-
lently and disappeared

  no change of expression came over jesus
face but his eyes watched the ripple where
the crocodiles snout had disappeared as if
in meditation with some little effort i
tried to show no concern and pulled my
mind back to the last thing jesu had said

  a man may visit his traps twice a day
naturally i agreed grimly but not twice
in one morning

  for some reason my simple assertion
flung jesu into a surprizing transport

  one morning i he yelled one morn-
ing dips rnios the senor has lived in
paradise today-one morning-it is sun-
down this moment

  i stared up and down the yellowing
river it really was sundown

  that is how i forgot the arapunga i had
limed

iv

fdr three long minutes after my formal
request sefior monan sat consuming
his cigaret in silence at last he made a
little movement and flicked the ash

  i suppose you have already asked
lwanna-the american custom i believe

  i agreed wondering how that would af-
fect his spanish code

  he became reflective and i anticipated
lwannas youth as an objection but he
did not mention it

  if you were a venezuelan senor le-
fever he began again i would impress
it upon you that my social standing is
gone if you were a spaniard i would say
that my fortune is confiscated but as you

are an american-

  i got to my feet this could mean only
assent i began to burble a confusion of
thanks and relief when senor monan
stopped me

  as you are an american i must tell
you that i have kilted a man i am a
murderer senor lefever

  i paused blankly he looked at me
searchingly

  ah that does make a difference i see
  not in the least in my desire to marry



tiger lure
rom

your daughter i said but still-a

t looked at my host  could scarcely
believe it but still those burned-out eyes
must have seen many things

  senor monan dropped his stub in the

ash-holdej-

  i knew you would say that if you were
perfectly frank the anglo-saxon world
has a quaint indirection in moral affairs
and an admirable direction in money
matters-the exact opposite of our latin
races for instance if i had made my
money by speculating in stocks and had
driven half a dozen men to suicide you
would feel no such qualms as when i tell
you i cut a man down in the performance
of my duty-my duty mind you

  it does make a difference i admitted
  monan nodded

  because moral indirection conforms to
the genius of your race take your anglo-
saxon marriage customs young men and
young women go about freely together dur-
ing courtship

  i agreed wondering how this could bear
on the topic

  that is because of an assumption the
lover seeks in his sweetheart something
other than sex

  certainly we assume that

  you personally

  i personally sefior monan 

  what

  a man can admire a womanly soul i
stated warmly

  my host pulled down his lips slightly
your adjective suggests sex to me
well a womans soul i corrected
tartly

  neuter gender

  yes-if there be such a thing

  did you ever find yourself reveling in
any mans society on account of his soul
he inquired

  it would have been easy enough for me
to have said yes and for a moment i
thought yes the true answer but when i
tried to lay my finger on some specific in-
stance in my own life i could not do it i
shifted my ground and declared that many
times i had admired a woman for her

intellect

  senor monan paid no attention to this
whatever but finished his own argument
by saying that the spaniard accepts sex

l n c e 

directly as the nexus between men and
women and such being the case the two
sexes are kept apart until marriage

  this discussion at such a time nettled
me it seemed a sort of profanation of
lwanna

  that may be logical i agreed shortly
but i dont care for argument when i
know and feel something is true

  sefior monan made a placating gesture
there was even a look of satisfaction on his
worn face

  pardon me senor lefever for trying
you on these points what you feel and
believe on it will be of vital interest to your
wife and lwanna is all i have on earth
he paused sadly then said i hope you
will be very tender with her sefior le-
fever

  i jumped up and grabbed his hand

  then what you have just said doesnt
represent your heart i cried in great
relief

  only my brain and that doesnt influ-
ence a mans belief he paused then
added a tiger caught one of my goats
last night angela was greatly excited
over it

  i was surprized at this break in the con-
versation when it occurred to me that
there might be a symbolic connection be-
tween the tiger catching the goat and some
man marrying his daughter

  after this our talk shifted to my ap-
proaching wedding this would require
more servants in the house and both senor
monan and i thought it best that i should
go to the village and employ them in order
that my host might not expose himself to
unnecessary publicity then another topic
pressed forward in our conversation-
lwannas dislike for my profession

  for some time we sat talking over this
problem when sefior monan suggested that
instead of collecting specimens i might
write a descriptive ornithology the idea
attracted me ever since boyhood i have
felt the lure of authorship in fact i had
begun two or three abortive romances but
it never occurred to me to write on the fa-
miliar topic of my own occupation when
t told lwanna of my plan her reception of
it removed the last quibble from my mind

  on the sunday after our conversation our
bans of marriage were published by a padre
from ciudad bolivar who made monthly

if
mmmwwzmji romance

visitations to taos the following weeks
were the happiest of my life thanks to
our isolation senor monan disregarded
strict spanish convention and nearly every
day lwanna and i set out into the jungle
armed with camera note-book and binocu-
lars to advance our great work

one morning just as we had started
on an expedition a native woman met
us among the moriche palms and to my
surprize handed me a note written on a
cigaret shuck

   i took it curiously and a second look at
the girl showed me the arawak wife of the
chinese chilli-maker i wondered what
business the celestial could have with me
when at the bottom of the note i saw the
signature-

jesu ercole baveno

   is this from jesu diabolo i inquired
the woman was scrutinizing lwannas
face with such intensity i was forced to
repeat my question and she nodded

  i looked at the shuck again and found
the text almost illegible although the name
was signed with great flourishes

  what does he want i asked bruskly
he wants not to be killed senor
how came he to send you i pro-
ceeded with some curiosity

   i happened to be there senor

  she shifted her polished black eyes
toward lwanna again

  at that moment an oven-bird broke
covert like a young zeppelin not a hundred
yards from us and went booming toward
the river

come on lwanna i cried in excite-
ment a new species-mark him down
the arawak girl hung trotting on our
rear will you kill him senor will you
kill him

   no i cried impatiently tell him as
long as he stays in taos i wont touch his
knavish hide

   but senor argued the girl still trot-
ting he wishes to trap here ilong the
river he knows the runs here but you
stay in the jungle all the time and perhaps
you shoot him

  we can do without him over here i
tossed back as i hurried on

   but senor whimpered the girl jesu
ays he will be a bad half-breed no more

maybe he will catch the tiger that kills
your goats

  i wondered how the news of the tigeps
attack had seeped into the village per-
haps through old angela this gave me a
feeling of discomfort and i was about to
turn on the girl and order her out of the
palm walks when lwanna took the girls
part she said we were happy and we
should not give unhappiness to others

   at that moment i glimpsed the spatulate
bill of my oven-bird stiffly upright among
some creepers i knew three words more
would send it booming off again as i
manipulated my camera i whispered
bruskly to the girl that jesu could trap all
over the place if she would only hold her
tongue and creep off without noise this
last she did very adroitly for i never knew
when she left us

  with lwanna at my elbow the orni-
thology grew like a weed in the springtime
senor monan suggested that i write the
book in english that lwanna turn it into
spanish while he attempted a french and
a portuguese translation thus we hoped
to publish the book simultaneously in
venezuela brazil and the united states
and in three european capitals

  to accomplish this senor monan put
me in touch with several foreign publishers
and so considerable mail accumulated for
me in taos

   i made a number of trips to the village
and the alcalde who was also postmaster
became tremendously interested in my
venture and through this we became good
friends

   i always found him at his baize table
with his official blanks his liquor oranges
and glasses when i entered he would
blow out a delicate smoke ring through
the part in his mustache put his feet down
from the table top push glass and carafe
toward me and exclaim in a long marveling
breath

  drink senor lefever how little did
i fancy i should ever drink with a writer
of books in taos how lonely i was until
you came you may confide in me senor
we are brothers i too am a writer of
books-poems as yet they have never
been published but dona isabella vitellia
who lives on the esplanade in caracas
has done me the honor to compare my
poems favorably with those of mombello

tiger lure
romance cssfflgs

  then he would tell me with shining eyes
of his relations with dona isabella vitellia
 never found out what he meant for me to
confide in him and after a time or two i
looked upon it as rhetorical

  he always had my mail at hand in a neat
package on his desk and there was a cer-
tain uniform frayedness about the seal flaps
which i fancied must be caused by the
long journey from civilization to taos
however i learned the real reason in a very
naive fashion one afternoon when i entered
the post and found the alcalde fairly pal-
pitant with excitement

  senor he cried out on sight of me
make haste quickly you have a great deal
of mail

  i hurried but to my surprize only a
few letters lay on the desk

  i picked up the package puzzled when
the alcalde made an impatient gesture-
why dont you read them

  i wouldnt be impolite i told him
take no notice of your friend here
read this one

  he chose a flimsy envelope of french
design from paris

  i broke it open under the alcalde it was
an outright acceptance of my manuscript
by lestrade  company

  isnt that glorious cried the alcalde
seizing my hand senor you can not
fancy how uneasy i was-getting some one
to print a manuscript is so difficult i
know my own poetry senor the poems

dona isabella vitellia praised so-

  my face doubtless betrayed me for he
broke off staring at me then he clapped
my hand again in the utmost good spirit

  think nothing of it he declared i
grew so impatient for my good friend le-
fever-i too am an author-i know the
pangs you may confide in me but
what do i mean chattering like this-
seized his bottle-this deserves a glorious
round fleres to the fame and fortune
of the ornithology of venezuela-widely
widely may it circulate

  it was impossible to be offended i
believe i even gave him formal permission
to open any future letters of mine that
came under his hands

pir an hour or so we sat drinking and
smoking and talking like schoolboys
only those who have disposed of a first

manuscript can sympathize with our ela-
tion after a bit the alcalde began specu-
lating on my royalties mentioning absurdly
large amounts in the midst of our castle-
building he put his glass down and caught
my arm impulsively

  by the way senor i have a capital
anecdote when you write another book
about the animals of venezuela

  i begged him to believe that i was solely
an ornithologist and my field did not ex-
tend to mammals

  but to a writer like you senor lefever
what is the difference birds or beasts
now listen only this afternoon a negro
named sammu tenko brought a dead tiger
into taos he killed it with a stroke of
his club he is a giant senor this sammu
tenko he brought it in on his back
you should have seen that mottled beauty
hanging over his huge dark shoulders-a
picture

  what did he do with it i inquired

  he gave it to jesu diabolo to skin for
the glands i believe the half-breed is
down at the river now you might go see

  skinning it for the glands i repeated
curiously

  yes to make his animal scent-his lure
the fellow is uncanny at it he can drive
an animal mad one sniff dispels all cau-
tion all timorousness-why i know a
dozen marvelous anecdotes the alcalde
meditated a moment did i ever tell
you how a capvbara stole senor monans
watch out of his pocket one day when he
fell asleep in his moriche walks yes
indeed really you see the senor had
accidentally touched his watch with this
animal scent and- i began to laugh-
senor monangot his lure from jesu of
course

  naturally

 so the senor and jesu were once
friends i observed

  one could hardly say friends the half-
breed trapped on the seitors plantation
because the capybaras gnawed the young
palms they disagreed about-they dis-
agreed- he paused a moment then ob-
served irrelevantly-your future wife is a
lovely girl senor such beauty such breed-
ing if i were a rich author now- he
inhaled deeply of his cigaret and breathed
forth a hazy sigh then said brightly
dont forget to see the tiger	a

by t  s stribling
  i promised and bade the alcalde adios
and as i passed through the heated plaza
i debated languidly the propriety of such
a visit i had little desire to go near jesu
diabolo but taos held such a deadly
monotony and a jaguar was such a novelty
i decided i would go see it at the corner
of the cloister i was about to step into the
path leading to the river when i saw a huge
jet-black negro naked to the waist leaning
on the chinamans counter eating chilli

  above a wide undulating back a thick
neck peaked off into a trivial head the
negro sprawled about the bowl and the
muscles of his black arms swelled and
slumped at each slight lift of the spoon to
his gross mouth as i looked i thoroughly
regretted that i had not seen sammu tenko
march into taos with the tiger on his back

  sin fan the chilli-maker regarded the
voracious belly-god as intently as i under
his flowing shirt the chinamans bulk
spread over his bean bags his eyes
gleamed at sammu tenko like slits of jet
in the yellow expanse of his face

  after a while my prolonged standing de-
manded either conversation or trade i
cast about for a remark and observed that
the chilli-makers stock of beans was run-
ning low

  go was fo long grunted sin fan

  going to leave taos

  i was somewhat surprized i knew
chinese moved about but no one had ever
heard or seen one of them in transit sin
fan and his kind simply appeared and
disappeared

  yes-want chilli

  the flatness of the answer made a pur-
chase imperative i leased my place at
the counter by taking a bowl

  your wifes not in this morning i
pursued with intent to please

  sin fan made a clucking in his enormous
bag of a throat but to my astonishment
tammu tenko snapped his fingers like fire
crackers and bellowed with mirth his
yawping fascinated me what i had said
to amuse him i could not guess i watched
him attentively until he subsided into a
wide grin when he finished his chilli he
straightened with a yawn of comfort patted
his belly ran a huge fist into his pocket
with a-

  quanti sriior

  nada nothing grunted sin fan

deftly hooking in the dish and refilling and
replacing it before the giant

  sammu stared at the bowl then at the
chilli-maker with surprize and delight cari-
catured on his uncouth face

  nada

  nada

nada	

  sin fan returned no answer except a
faint and i thought a sarcastic gesture
toward the bowl with pudgy yellow finger

  with a rumbled gracias and the look
of a grateful dog tenko hunkered once
more about the heaping bowl and fell to
sucking it into his pendulous lips

  his voracity filled me with a faint
nausea i pushed my own chilli aside
what a prodigious animal i attempted
no more conversation with either of them
the three of us differed racially from one
another until we were almost of different
species by what epochs of culture i sur-
passed the negro as for sin fan

  i studied that inscrutable off-shoot of the
worlds oldest civilization was he far
down the road my own race would one day
tread would my great great grandsons
sit as this fat chilli-maker indifferentists
ultimate pacifists husks of dead souls
waiting for extinction

with a shudder i turned from the
grotesque extremes and walked
across the fish-scented plaza toward the
river the river front at taos is a bare
bank piled with hides rubber caripe
copra and the like a number of stakes
extend out into the water where the fisher-
men hitch their boats during high and low
flood the harbor is choked with reeds
and lily-pads which grow faster than the
indolent boatmen can or do cut them out
here and there these water-plants moved
sinuously as a crocodile or a manatee glided
among diem

  for several minutes i squinted my eyes
against the sun-baked scene hunting jesus
camp at last some hundred yards up the
river i saw a thread of smoke climbing the
sky

  when i started for it t meant only to
walk within eye-shot of the half-breeds
concocting see the tiger and return
however when i entered the iungle i found
it difficult to judge the distance of the
smoke through the bamboo tops

tiger lure
  i blundered on until at last i pushed
aside a screen of leaves and stepped un-
expectedly into a little circular opening
there jesu and the aravvak wife of the
chilli-maker lay dozing on a bamboo mat
with their arms about each other at my
entrance neither moved but both lifted
their eyes to me from a fathomless content

  with much embarrassment and many
pardons i attempted to back out again
but the half-breed called

  stay sefior you have come to see the
tiger sit down and look the animal
lure is boiling in the pot you do not dis-
turb me or pechita eh does he carissima
he pressed the girls lithe symmetry
with lazy amorous questioning

  i saw the two were amid their irregular
luua de miel their honeymoon and some-
how i could not repress a certain admira-
tion for a man so unashamed of his loves

  the woman looked at me through half-
open eyes yawned luxuriously and mur-
mured something in arawak

  jesu diabolo laughed pulled her ear
then turned to me with the duty of host
written large upon him he pointed with
his free arm

  there is where sammu tenko hit the
tiger just at the joint back of the head
he broke its neck sefior but did not even
scratch its skin what a giant he is

  i looked at the yellow and black glory
stretched on bamboos at the end of the
oval clearing

  its a wonderful pelt i admired
pechita tells me that i may trap for
the tiger that disturbs senor monans
goats very well i prepare this lure he
is mine then i shall have another pelt
as grand as that probableviente

  i hesitated there was no oven-bird
now to hasten my answer i looked at the
lickerish fellow he had become a bene-
dict in a way and only the night before
the jaguar had renewed his depredations
as for getting it with a rifle one might as
well chase a flicker of sunshine and shadow

  jesu regarded me intently with his pale
protruding eye he pressed the indian girls
form slightly and said

  you can hardly object to my trapping
for it now sefior when men are married
they should forgive each other their
bachelor deeds eh

  a mirthless smile twisted the half-breeds

lips i knew quite well he was thinking
of our chase through the jungle my re-
luctance was unconcealed

  we do need a skilful trapper over

there-

  sefior said jesu disengaging his arm
and lifting himself slightly i understand
now that arawaks are not spaniards i
who am both could not realize that-there
is a line now i understand where
sefiorita monan would be miserable where
pechita is happy the sefiorita with her
softness and her white skin out here in

the jungle-

  the fellows face went that peculiar
ashen gray again his pale eye stared at me

  may i say i was wrong sefior insane-
mad-a dog with the rabies and-shake
your hand

  jesu said i i know that men are
mad mixtures today i am a supremely
happy man and i believe you are too
when our quarrels gone i see no reason
for holding a grudge trap where and
when you like and i wish you luck

  then diabolo patted the girls smooth
coffee-colored skin

one momenta dulce he whispered
they kissed clingingly as if for a lifelong
separation and he arose and took my hand

  and sefior he said you will need
servants at the hacienda for your approach-
ing marriage if you would speak a word
for pechita

  i recalled my commission to hire a girl
then as i looked at the girl the thought
of this lithe pantheress serving lwanna
filled my mind like a picture they would
be worthy the palet of an alma tadema
without more ado i engaged pechita as a
maid for my fiancee

  the girl turned her polished black eyes
on me and somehow they resembled the
eyes in the tigers pelt that lay stretched
on the bamboo

v

none of us at the hacienda i believe
ever quite grew accustomed to pechi-
ta she was a capable maid she kept our
clothes pressed our footgear polished our
study bright with flowers she even as-
sisted lwanna in designing her wedding
gowns

  the trouble was i had selected pechita

by t s stribling
for her comeliness and that out in the
jungle where women look their worst now
that we had the girl inside she was sym-
metrical to a disconcerting degree i say
disconcerting because no ordinary man i
take it feels quite at ease when a venus in
sard fits house-slippers on his feet or brings
morning coffee to his bedside

  i continually had to strangle impulses
to offer her my chair and to retrieve any
little article she dropped it was hard to
remember she was the maid the fact is
i never saw pechita move about the place
but what i heard the ghost of cymbals and
castinets and thought of salomes dance
before herod for the head of john the
baptist

  a trivial incident brought about the
girls discharge one morning i entered the
dining-room and saw pechita taking an
impression of the monan coat of arms by
rubbing charcoal over a paper pressed upon
the design she worked so intently i was
at her shoulder before she observed me
then she started dropped the platter with
a crash and the paper fluttered to the floor
both of us stooped for it and our heads
bumped together in an embarrassing
fashion i handed her the paper and asked
her what she wanted with the impression

  she stammered and finally said that she
loved beautiful things i was surprized
that she admired the escutcheon which was
of severe design i mentioned this

  the simpler the design is said the girl
still embarrassed the more easily i can
tell what makes it beautiful

  i stared at the comely brown creature
astonished at such untaught analysis she
had stated instinctively a major canon of
esthetics in its clearest form i was about
to follow this up with other questions when
i heard a little gasp behind me i turned
and saw lwanna staring at us with quite
a pale face she dismissed the maid with
a gesture

  jean she began in a queer tone
paused then went on what were you say-
ing to-pechita about beauty

  with a tinge of embarrassment i saw
she had given the whole affair a personal
turn it in no way deserved yet i found it
a little difficult to say to my fiancee that i
was not making love to her maid how-
ever i managed to explain it

  lwanna seemed to understand at once

then perhaps three minutes later to my
great surprise she began talking breath-
lessly

  she said she had heard of pechitas con-
duct in the village first living with the
chinaman then with jesu diabolo and
now here she is talking to you about
b-beauty i-i dont see how she can
h-have the b-boldness- here lwanna
began sobbing

  it nonplussed me in the first place i
wondered what gossip had spread such
greasy village news then i was shocked
at the quickness with which lwanna con-
nected pechitas change of husbands and
our conversation concerning beauty

  i reexplained the whole matter very
carefully to my fiancee and this time she
really understood my interview with pe-
chita had been as impersonal as beauty
itself nevertheless that evening pechita
was discharged and on the whole i can not
say that i regretted it

  during the following weeks we had sev-
eral other girls at the hacienda but not one
suited they were either lazy or incom-
petent or both as our wedding day drew
near and as sewing and baking piled up on
these incompetents i think lwanna went
to her father and through him sent me
word to hire pechita again it was odd
how we avoided all reference to the girl
between ourselves

  at the time senor monan delivered the
message we were alone in a goat lot where
old angela milked only the night before
something had killed one of these animals
and my host and i had gone down to look
over the scene the senor stood leaning
against the fence where we had found some
big feline tracks he seemed amused that
lwanna should recall the arawak girl

  the droll part to me is the objection
that lwanna presses against pechitas
morals said i

  most men are ready to condone wo-
men observed my host slyly

  what i mean is i explained the very
thing that makes pechita a good servant is
the fact that she has lived with sin fan
otherwise she would never have developed
that silence and deftness and that sense of
beauty that now makes her invaluable

  this lead us into a long discussion as to
which was the more educative virtue or
vice under senor monans artful sophis-



tiger lure
romance

try i saw a dozen facets of the subject and
reached no conclusion whatever a few
days later pechita once more glided like a
dryad about the hacienda

  during this period i saw nothing of jesu
diabolo i almost wished for him because
pumas or ocelots or some carnivore really
were ravaging the senors goats it grew
to be a sort of habit for me and the sen or
tu go down and look at the tracks left by
the marauders and i believe in his heart
he too thought of jesu diabolo and de-
sired the half-breed back again

one waning afternoon as we returned
to the hacienda after our futile
inspection i found lwanna on the front
steps of the adobe waiting for me in her
hand she held a letter sent to me by the
alcalde it had just come up from taos
by a native boy in fact a very odd
correspondence had sprung up between
me and the agent for the rubber company

  it began by a note penciled on the mar-
gin of one of my incoming letters that
showed me the postmaster had read it
later a quatrain of the alcaldes verse
slipped out of a letter from my brazilian
publisher then bits of village gossip
sifted into my mail as it came through the
post-office at taos after a while these
lengthened into regular epistles at first
lwanna was angry at such liberties but
after a bit she began to look forward to
what the alcalde had to say in reality
i suppose the poor fellow was very lonely
down there among the mestizos caribs and
arawaks

  this particular letter seemed to amuse
lwanna for she was smiling over it when
she handed it to me it began

honored senor

  the village is all agog over your wedding
and well may it be for never again will taos be
honored by the hymenial celebrations of a great
litterateur your maid pechita reports all your
magnificent preparations to jesu and he to me

  sammu tenko came to me today so full of
chilli that positively he was filmed with grease
apparently our giant has replaced pechita with
sin fan yesterday i saw sammu pick up an
enormous pot of boiling chilli in his bare hands
move it ten or fifteen feet for the chinaman and
sip it on the way when he put it down he
slapped his palms together as one doer when one
has handled a too hot poker i do not ask you
to believe this friend of my soul it is quite
impossible but it is true

  there was a great wailing among the mestizos
last night martilino the boy who fished with a
spear was devoured by a cayman at the wharf
the boatmen succeeded in recovering an arm
and a foot dona maria his mother is begging
for money to have a mass said for her son
there is much discussion whether it will cost as
much to get an arm and a foot into heaven as a
whole boy i believe the padre was puzzled
but as their alcalde i silenced them i told them
with god a day was as a thousand years and a
mere toe-nail as a whole boy and that the price
would be the same i believe i am correct

                  your admiring friend

            juan malar alcalde of taos

p s when you receive this letter come to me
and let us talk over life and death j m

  it was near sundown when lwanna and
i finished the alcaldes gossipy letter

  are you going to see him she asked

  i dare say ill drop in some time

  what does he mean by talk over life
and death

  i pinched my sweethearts chin

  what you are to me dona isabella
vitellia is to the alcalde

  i said it lightly enough but lwanna
opened her eyes

  is she a dona there was tragedy in
her tone

  for several minutes we sat discussing the
unfortunate love of the alcalde for another
mans wife against that tragic back-
ground our own love stood in warm belief

  presently lwanna declared it would be
night before we reached the jungle and she
called pechita to bring our tramping boots
when the maid appeared lwanna retired
tc change her footgear and to bring my
flashlight and camera

  i continued on the steps filled with vague
pleasant thoughts such as the evening
brings when i heard a guarded voice call
my name i glanced out through the palm
walks and saw the figure of a man leaning
against a tree

  i was not at all averse now to seeing and
speaking with jesu diabolo in fact i
desired to give him some instructions
however i knew the half-breed was still
afraid to show himself before senor monan
so i arose and walked toward the palms
thinking i would direct him to lay traps
around the goat lot

  as i approached peering through the
dusk mainly i believe to discover
diabolos detestable eye-flap i was sur-
prized to see the expected face melt into
that of the alcalde a few steps nearer i

by t s stribling

  i
r omance

was not only surprized i was perplexed to
see the alcalde labored under some strong
emotion

  what brought you out of your hole
i laughed out of yankee habit to avoid the
emotional

  ah senor he caressed his mustache
put a hand on his hip and dropped into a
romantic attitude what a happy man you
are-the beautiful lwanna-what delicate
sentiftient what poetry

   he cast up his eyes at the fading sky and
sighed deeply

  by this i knew the alcalde had heard
lwannas sympathy that he was in such
amorous despair ordinarily i would have
changed the subject but there was some-
thing in the evening the drift of perfume
through the air the palms the fading
light-i made an awkward effort to sym-
pathize in words i even tried to fancy i
had lost lwanna in an effort to feel with
him i succeeded only too well i be-
came choked instead of eloquent we
english-speaking races have such mala-
droit emotions

   after a bit the alcalde asked me if i had
received his note

  at that moment i assured him and
i meant to come and see you

  i was afraid the boy had lost it or-
my friend drew out his cigaret-case and
offered me one-or had been robbed he
finished

  who should rob my mail-boy in taos

i questioned

  the alcade shrugged and spread his
hands apart one of which held a little cigar-
lighter

  there you are i dont know it is
a mystery ah senor before you came to
taos how monotonous life was nothing
but vain regrets vain longings-

   if the alcalde thought i would hark back
to his lament about dona isabella viteuia
he was mistaken

  but what about the mystery i inter-
posed

  i know it is a mystery that is all
repeated the postmaster eight days ago
a letter was posted in my office at night
so i could not see the writer well natur-
ally any one would have a curiosity about
a man who chooses to come creeping around
at night with his letters why at night
why should he not bring it in the light

si		tiger

of open day if his heart is clean ah
senor lefever no matter how evil you
think of men you err on the side of charity
did the letter concern me in any way

it was directed to the chief of police
in caracas

  there was a certain inflexion in the
alcaldes voice as if he questioned me
delicately concerning my relations with
that official

  dont be alarmed for me senor malar
i smiled i have no quarrel whatever
with the jeje de policia in caracas i am
just what i seem a bird-catcher and
nothing more

  oh i did not mean that at all pro-
tested the alcalde but sefior lefever the
envelope was thin very thin indeed and i
distinctly saw the impression of a coat of
arms on a bit of paper and with it a letter
in barbarous handwriting saying

  in taos in the department of rio tigre
there hides a man who calls himself monan who
is wanted for some crime here is his coat of
arms i know any one who bears a coat of arms
must come from caracas there will be a wed-
ding in the house of this monan on the twen-
tieth of this month it will be easy for officers
to enter among the guests and arrest this senor
monan the writer will guide the officers

i

  the postmaster paused then added
blandly

   i saw that through the envelope it
had no name-perhaps the name was folded
out of sight

  then senor monans retirement is be-
trayed i ejaculated blankly

  i dont know said the alcalde per-
haps the jeje de policia never received that
letter he inhaled a deep breath of smoke
and blew it out thoughtfully our mails
are so uncertain

  i seized the alcaldes hand in a glow of
relief

  seilor i appreciate your friendship
more than i can say

  it is nothing he protested quickly
we intellectuals must stand together
when i looked at that letter i thought
shall i allow a brother authors bridal bed
to be disturbed by the thought of a convict
for a father-in-law shall the hoi polloi
triumph over genius

  then there is no danger-no immediate
danger i said in relief

lure
romance

  none unless the writer has posted some
other communication i thought i would
mention it to you the twentieth comes
on thursday

  well the cats out of the bag anyway

i worried well have to leave here
perhaps well go-but theres no use my

planning-

  you might stay here and finish your
book senor lefever suggested the al-
calde and follow the senor later

  oh i couldnt do that i couldnt
leave lwanna in uncertainty suppose
they should capture her father leave that
child among enemies without a protector
the thought filled me with dismay

  alios dios no ejaculated the alcalde
seizing my hand and gripping it i was
a fool to suggest it i understand-how
well i understand amigo de alma friend of
my soul he paused a moment and then
asked delicately would you mind telling
me what the senor did

   he killed a man i said somberly
enough

  the alcalde shrugged

  bah what a fuss over nothing there
must be some political end to it

  it was a political murder i believe

  i thought so a mere man-we have
too many men at best the fewer the men
the greater the plenty he took my
lapel do you know what i say i say 
the murderer is the real patriot and the
police are the real enemies of a country

  i suppose he meant to pay a sort of com-
pliment to my future father-in-law

  at that moment i heard lwanna calling
from the entrance of the estancia where she
had missed me on her return

  the alcade squeezed my hand

  adios i did not want to disturb the
scnorita with my news if you go i shall
think of you

  he touched his small urban hat and hur-
ried away through the palms

as lwanna came up she glimpsed his
retreating figure and asked me who it was

i told her and she was greatly surprized at
the alcaldes visit she inquired if he had
come to talk of the dona vitellia

  at her innocent question a tenderness
flooded me for the girl i should not tell
her the real reason of the alcaldes visit
she held the purity of a spider-lily sprung
from the bosom of a marsh i took her in

my arms and in my heart i vowed no
matter what befell the monan house
nothing should happen to her she re-
turned my embrace and kisses ardently
and as i felt her soft lips against mine i
knew she was thinking of the alcalde and
the dona vitellia

  after a little pause i said-

  now let us hurry on we want to snap
all the photographs possible tonight

  why tonight she asked curiously
well we dont know how long well be
here

  she looked at me

  you are not thinking of going away
jean

  one never knows i answered im-
personally your father came here from
caracas he may decide to go back-or
somewhere else one never knows

  i tried to put it casually but she must
have caught the worried overtones in my
voice

  i wish he could go back to caracas
jean-my poor father

  she said no more and we moved silently
with our arms about each other toward
the jungle

  by this time day had faded and given
place to a pale moonlight a breeze arose
among the palms and set their leaves a-
clacking for some reason whether for
nerves or cold i can not say i shivered as
the shadows darkened

  the murder to which senor monan con-
fessed had been till now little more than
an abstraction to me with the alcaldes
warning it had crystallized into a grim
enough reality now disquieting thoughts
of pursuing officers clung to my mind i
put them away as illogical i assured
myself the earliest moment pursuers could
arrive was two days distant but the feeling
remained with me perhaps it was not so
much any actual officer that i dreaded as
-i hardly know how to express it-a sense
of guilt sprung up within me the very
crime itself seemed to creep along in the
moonlight behind me

  once or twice i even glanced back through
the hazy palms they lay quite empty i
repeated to myself that we were not crim-
inals till a month ago i had never even
heard of the murder if the officers were
on the trail they would never follow me
an ornithologist nor this innocent girl

by t  s stribling
romance

  i shook my shoulders and attempted to
throw off my apprehensions nevertheless
for the first time since i came to taos i
was filled with misgivings

by this time the last glimmer of day
had faded and the moonlight had
strengthened into brilliancy everywhere
lay dense shadows and placid high lights
ahead of us the jungle arose sheer as a
wall it loomed a black mystery filled
with strange noises that did not add to my
composure

   i had heard those sounds over and over
but tonight the bubbling of the hervi-
dores those strange birds that moan like
the boiling of a kettle brushed my nerves
with a sense of fear even familiar sounds
as the bellowing of alligators from the dis-
tant river and the demoniacal laughter
of a loon filled me with a queer eerieness
only the categorical knowledge that nothing
in the venezuelan wilderness not even the
jaguar or the boa would attack man per-
suaded me to enter

  inside however the place was not so
black as it appeared spangles of light
and shadow lay over the ground like a
leopards skin however the impression
that something followed me persisted to
such an extent that i made some pretext
and paused in the warm dank gloom to
watch the palms and convince myself they
were indeed quite empty we stood in our
covert five perhaps ten minutes the
long walks lay silent in the moonlight
crisscrossed with shadows the only mov-
ing thing i saw was a bat that flickered this
way and that on sudden impossible tacks
its evolutions reminded me of some des-
perate fugitive pursued by invisible fees

  i still watched it when an impression
grew on me that my own pursuer whatever
it was had quitted the moriche walks and
was creeping up behind me through the
jungle so strong it became i glanced
around in the spangled light what i saw
startled me a specter monkey with
enormous eyes stared at me from a low
branch the creature was harmless but
odd to say my apprehension increased
rather than diminished

  however the incident proved that my
whole trouble was nerves no human pur-
suer could shift so suddenly from grove to
jungle my jumpiness was caused no

	tiger

doubt solely from senor monans danger
so i went on at least fortified if not calmed
by this intellectual assurance to the brazil
tree where lwanna and i did most of our
photographic work

  as i have said the brazil tree was
shrouded with vines and night blossoms
filled the warm gloom with a peculiar
sweetness lwanna was a better climber
than i she still retained the agility of
early girlhood she used the vines as
ratlines and i could dimly see her slender
form climbing the perfumed tangle i was
about to hand up the camera to her when
her foot slipped and she would have fallen
if i had not caught her

  i was surprised at the mischance usu-
ally she was as sure-footed as a monkey
still it was nothing we swung up on the
broad first limb and settled ourselves to
wait for a subject worthy our lense

  once we were quiet the jungle noises
stood out plainly in the night far aloft
in our green giant came sleepy whisperings
of birds then a cicada that had been
frightened out of his song by our climb be-
gan a tentative whirring a little later a
mousing owl dropped by us like a shadow
and struck at some prey invisible to us on
the ground

  at some distance away a firefly patrolled
the crest of a fern tree rising and falling
among the fronds brilliant in shadow and
pale in moonlight afar off the loon
laughed again and the alligators bellowed
in rio tigre

  the glooms and sheens of the mysterious
tropical night were filled with a warm green
smell as of a gigantic hothouse its lan-
guid air drifted sweet or spicy or rank of
mold yet through the changing bouquet i
hought there persisted a flavor a tang
that i had known at another time and
place in its stronger gusts i sniffed at it
curiously trying to place it then i would
forget it for other things it was a warm a
fleshly odor oddly insistent instead of
memories it seemed to stir emotions as
it drifted in and out my lungs a feeling of
langour trickled through my body as ener-
vating as too many roses or the dawn of
opium

  as we sat i sensed some kindred emotion
in lwanna i reached out and touched her
arm she was trembling i swung my
camera aside and drew her close

lure
romance

  you are not afraid i whispered

  she lifted her arms about my neck

  ah no amidinorl her voice trembled
it is the night-and the moon see how it
streams down oh it pours through me

  she stretched out -her arms and shud-
dered in a sort of ecstacy

  i have thought on that strange tropical
night some motiving of ancient arboreal
ancestors epochs past revisited our brains
that murmuring moon-shot jungle crooned
over us as some passionate mother over her
babes i held lwanna close couched
among the vines filled with a vast restful-
ness

  as we lay a sloth inched up the spanish
arbor a dull black body amid the glimmer
of the flowers we watched it with dreamy
indifference as it crept topsy-turvy under
the bottom of a limb between us and the
moon presently i saw its prey some sort
of large bird perched like a black ball
i watched them intently sloth and bird
somehow i felt a feeling of fellowship for
the sloth as if his word were not utterly
insulated from my own he was a citizen
of the tree like me

  lwanna stirred in my arms and lifted
herself slightly

  that is a very strange picture she
whispered we ought to take it for our
book

  the thought of our ornithology came to
my mind as unimportant as the rustle of a
leaf it was nothing whatever i caressed
my betrotheds soft body kissed her lips
but she would stir and make the picture
she took the camera and moved to her feet
again her foot slipped and she would have
fallen had i not caught her the noise sent
the sloth swinging silently to the tree-
trunk

  lwanna almost wept over her awkward-
ness

  my slipper feels greased she com-
plained and sat down and took off her
slippers

  i told her to go in stocking feet and
readied to take the slippers

  wheji i touched them my fingers really
felt some sort of grease on their instep soles
it had the same pungent peculiar odor that
i had observed before

  still even this suggested nothing to me
in fact i thought little about it but re-
arranged my position along the limb with

the luxury of a man coming out of sleep
when i heard my companion give a gasp

  i looked at her curiously

lvvannastooped peering downthrough
the gloom when she sensed my
unspoken question she pointed silently
downward with her free arm i looked
with rising apprehension but saw nothing
except the moon-spangled undergrowth
again i thought of officers and again a
brush of unreasonable fear went over me
i moistened my lips and scrutinized every
tree-trunk near-by for a hidden man then
i became aware of a sudden silence fallen
over the jungle

  i turned to lwanna and barely framed
the word-

  where

  wait till it moves again she breathed

  it i repeated staring below and try-
ing to follow her finger

  apparently she was pointing at a blank
patch of spangled moonlight when she
drew a little intake of breath and said-

  there

  and it seemed to me that a patch an un-
defined portion of that moonlight moved
nearer the bole of our tree it was barely
discernible a mere outline gliding along the
mottled ground the outline had the
form of a huge cat

  i felt a shock but a moments reflection
told me that jaguars never stalked human
beings then i sat up on the limb with a
sensation of actual pleasure that i might
see this jungle tragedy i was sharply
excited but not afraid i even hoped that
the denouement might be within hearing if
not within sight of our eyrie

  as i watched my mind became oddly
attentive to details i noted the nervous
flicker of the tip of the carnivores tail the
gradual silent advance then out of the
spangled shadows below appeared two coals
of greenish fire

  as i looked at the lambent eyes i sud-
denly recalled that a cat never looks away
from the game it is stalking it would be
difficult to describe the thrill that went over
me when i realized i was not the spectator
but the protagonist of the drama staged in
this silent jungle i almost stopped breath-
ing as t stared down at the faint mottled
outline and the two greenish coals

   dozen plans flashed through my head

by t s stribling
- romance

should i move i felt sure any movement
would be visited by an immediate charge
from the big cat below if we remained
motionless our fate was even more certain
 whispered the danger to lwanna without
shifting my eyes

  she made some reply but her whisper
faded into silence for at the faint sound
the jaguar had come sharply ahead as
noiselessly as the moving of a shadow a
crawly feeling went over my body at the
same time even in the midst of our immi-
nent danger i suddenly understood and
realized the fantastic deviltry of jesu
diabolo

  he had spread his lure all about the
brazil tree which he knew was our photo-
graphic field the very grease on lwannas
slippers must have been animal scent plast-
ered there by the arawak girl at the bidding
of her lover then if we escaped this the
whole cstancia was to be raided by officers
it was like walking through a phantasma-
goria as i beat my brain for some way
out of our present trap i wondered about
other pitfalls i glanced up the tree-but
any tree-traps set above us to stop our up-
ward flight would be masked

  a sweat broke out on me my fiancee
was on the outside of the limb

  lwanna i whispered slip around
me climb up the tree carefully

  lets both make a start together she
planned hurriedly you go first

  give me the flashlight

  a wild scheme darted through my head
  oh look-climb climb climb

  the monster below made a sudden bound
of horrifying height it was not ten feet
below us i leaped for the branch above
and by good luck caught it as i jerked
up on the limb i heard the rasp of huge
claws in bark then a loud report and a
blinding flare in the night lwanna had
exploded the flashlight

  i looked back as soon as my eyes could
see i made out lwanna on the first branch
staring below the cat was gone

  come on i shouted reaching down
go higher quick get out of my
way i can climb faster than you

  such urgency in her cry sent me scramb-
ling up the trunk i had penetrated a mass
of foliage when suddenly lawnna screamed
my name twice first from a bursting throat
then muffled-strangled

  what is it whats the matter
my mouth was so dry i could hardly
speak lwanna lwanna

  at the silence below a weakness came
over me my legs turned to water i
clung to the limb to keep from falling
then climbed back down sliding from
branch to branch and peered below

  the first limb was empty the whole
tree the ground below was void a vacant
patchwork of moonlight and shadow not
a trace of lwanna or of the tiger was any-
where both might have melted into the
spangled sheen

  then  knew that to save me lwanna
had stood on that first limb and had delib-
erately allowed the monster to reach her
while i climbed to safety

  standing there shaking i called her
name i screamed it out i dont know how
many times between screams i held my
breath and listened open-mouthed i heard
a vagrant breath of night-wand rustle
through the trees and die away in the
clammy stillness

  after a while a physical nausea filled me
i lay down on the limb and closed my eyes
i dont know how long i lay perhaps ten
minutes perhaps an hour i remember i
kept twisting my head from side to side
because a vision of lwanna shrinking be-
fore the tiger tortured my eyes i could
still hear her screaming my name i grew
deathly sick dizzy i almost fell i
clutched the vines with a swimming head
but a moment later i decided i would fall
deliberately a moments stunned thought
however told me i should climb higher as
high as possible and crush myself

  the brazil tree offered dizzy heights i
got myself together like a man weakened
from long sickness i lifted myself very
carefully and took the branch above me i
went up several branches higher then
when i contrasted my own shaking efforts
to reach an easy death with lwannas im-
molation a hideous contempt for myself
burned me

  i stopped climbing i would drop from
where i was my fingers were loosening
when far off through the night i heard the
laughter of a loon

  for some reason its irony brought jesu
diabolo to my mind thought of the half-
breed seemed to rouse some question in my
numb brain some impulse toward action

tiger lure
romance

i scarcely knew what i stood clinging to
the vines trying to think

  what could i do to jesu diabolo

  after painful study my duty clarified
into a very simple thing i felt before i
could have any right to join lwanna i
must first go to jesu diabolos camp and
kill him after that i might come back
to the brazil tree and to the woman who
had called my name

  i lowered myself like a palsied man
the vines where lwanna had stood were
torn and draggled

vi

as i stumbled through the moriche
walks following the path to the
hacienda i heard prolonged shrieks ahead
or me in my mental state i was not
surprized i wras not even curious at the
outcry it seemed but natural for the
whole world to be shrieking for the death of
lwanna

  presently a crooked figure appeared in
the moonlight tottering toward me from the
direction of the monan adobe the
screams grew louder and louder and then
between shrieks i heard a mumbling

  oh holy mother shriek peccavi-
mus shriek

  mother of god shriek dominus
uosotros shriek

  yet so bludgeoned was my brain that it
seemed commonplace- usual that old
angela should totter toward me venting
screams of despair spanish and patristic
latin

  oh senor lefever oh my god the
soldiers have come-for my maestro oh
gentle mary run senor lefever shoot
kill oh-

  i put my hand on the old wenchs shoul-
der and turned her about i remember
repeating several times

  it makes no difference angela
iwanna is dead go back to the casa
lwanna is dead dont shriek so she is
dead dead oh merciful god lwanna
is dead i

  hysterics shook the old woman she
wrung her claws and continued her screech-
ing as she turned back toward the adobe
but such was the hammering in my head as
i hurried toward taos i forgot her before
her outcries died in distance

  my mind was in chaos as i jogged on to
kill jesu diabolo the moonlight looked
reddish as i passed a hut in the jungle a
dog deserted its home and ran yelping into
the undergrowth queer disconnected
flashes went through my brain i remem-
ber thinking this hell on earth was the after-
math of senor monans murder as i ran
past the mission the hoary age of the pile
suddenly shrunk my own life to the beat
of a birds wing i saw myself as i was a
hurrying hating shadow of flesh that would
fade to carrion before morning

  in one of the mission stalls burned a dim
light as i drew near a huge man bearing
an enormous bundle moved out of the shad-
ows and turned toward the river behind
this giant came the ponderous baggy body
of the chilli-maker as the two crept
slowly toward the landing each bearing a
great weight i overhauled and passed them
nobody spoke i recalled for a second
sin fans intention to leave taos now he
was going

  fifty yards further i smelled the damp-
ness of the river i checked my speed and
went on more cautiously to my right as
i turned down the river lay the bamboo
brake which guarded jesus camp the
trail through the brake was more distinct
now than when i had first seen it an
inky path it lay until it lost itself in the
moon-washed bamboo by way of caution
i glanced back before i entered only the
two slow enormous figures were in sight and
they were half-way toward the wharf

  as i entered i heard a sound a pulsing
sound as i threaded the brake it grew and
grew until a gust of furious music beat in
my ears it held the rhythm and timbre of
a viol or cello in the hands of a bacchante
the music whirled and leaped through the
brake with impish zest it conjured up
maenads and corybantes in some walpurgis
night

  the nearer i crept the louder it grew
and presently i heard with it the rhythm of
feet and a womans panting breath another
turn and i saw the half-breed and the ara-
wak girl whirling about each other in a
mad fandango

  i crouched in the shadow of a clump
and watched them as they spun in the
full moon i caught glimpses of their faces
in rapid sequence diabolo wore the
ecstatic smile of a dancer his eye-flap

byt s stribling

 
romance

beat his cheek and there was a flame in
pechitas face she held her heart up to
this brown pan as a tigress might to its
mate he pursued her she eluded now
he caught her in his arms only for her to
wheel away at certain rhythmic inter-
vals she flung her torso back wildly in his
arms and on the upswing spun over his
shoulder then danced away

  both were without weight they were
flickering flames of joy in the moonlight
they were delirious at the monan destruc-
tion and yet somehow through it all they
preserved a sort of innocence-children
dancing around a tortured frog-there is no
explanation for it

  the music was jesus own humming no
viol could have been more vibrant where
he picked up the air or improvisation god
knows perhaps the ruin he had wrought
inspired him

  as i crouched in the bamboo a feeling
almost of peace came over me my pain of
life would soon be over and so would
jesus frothy dance the two of us would
no doubt rest quietly enough beside lwan-
na underground

  i waited till the whirling figures were
quite near me when i stepped into the
moonlight

  the dancers stopped so suddenly that
my eyes swung onward with their rhythm
pechita gave a little gasp jesu stared a
moment his face was in shadow then
he began a bland buenos nochas senor
when i leaped at him the girl shrieked
he reeled back then we went to the ground
struggling in each others arms

  the half-breed fought with the sudden
fury of a cat beating my head with his open
palms latin fashion i think his race does
not know what a fist is for but the hard
cushions of his palms jarred fire into my
eyes and rang like a bell in my ears

  my arms were under his and i kept
struggling to reach up around back of his
shoulders and across his throat for a reverse
nelson with such a leverage i could have
choked him instantly perhaps have broken
his neck

the indian knew nothing of wrestling
his frantic beating told that he
kicked my shins knocked and shoved my
head sweat broke out over him then
just as my fingers clawed up around his

damp neck the arawak girl locked her
hands under my chin and began pulling and
shrieking it brought us to a deadlock
i lunged forward with all my might two
inches more and my fingers would have
met over diabolos gorge the half-breed
writhed and doubled like a worm he butted
me in the face somehow he drew up his
knees and kicked with all his might into
the pit of my stomach

  nausea and spasms of pain shot through
me i flung myself sidewise gripped him
again and wrapped a leg around his he
stretched his neck forward to avoid my
crawling fingers until his eye-flap fanned
my face

  he screamed pechitas name at that
moment my fingers closed about his glottis
with a terrible effort of the muscles under
my grip he wheezed out- knife

  instantly the woman loosened my throat
i gulped a great breath i heard her rush
for a weapon to stab me in the back but
in that interim i flung my whole strength
against the breeds gullet

  he doubled backward his one pale eye
protruding beyond its socket in the moon-
light he made queer gagging noises
his fingers fluttered over my hands as if he
were begging dumbly i hated him because
he begged i prayed i could kill him before
the girl stabbed i prayed god she would
stab straight in not cut across my back
muscles and stop the pressure that was
garrotting her lover

  i heard steps behind me i flung my
last ounce of fury against his throat to kill
before i went when two big fingers pressed
into my clutching hands and opened them
a vise grip took my shoulder and separated
me from jesu diabolo as if we had been
manikins jesu rolled over on his back
with a hard rasping breath

  a terrible despair filled me that my mur-
der was balked when i realized jesu diab-
olo would live i sprang at the prostrate
man from all-fours but bumped head and
shoulders into sammu tenkos big naked
calves which stopped me like pads of rub-
ber i tried to switch around them the
legs moved and blocked me and finally
with a little fillip kicked me a couple of
yards away i gave up hope in my
strength and began begging desperately

  sammu let me to him for gods sake
sammu dont stop me

i

 i g li r lure
r o mance

  i charged again imploring the black man
to let me pass but he swung his hip around
and knocked me sprawling i lay sobbing
and cursing and begging i think i
screamed that jesu had killed lwanna-
i dont know what i said

  presently i saw one hand of the negro
held pechita by her two wrists she still
grasped a knife but it was immobile by
thistime the half-breed was on his knees
and began in a shocking aspirate-

  sammu-sammu-dear friends i will
repay-my souls brother-sammu-all i
have is yours-that madman- he pointed
toward me then choked suddenly and spat
a dark stain in the moonlight

 to my amazement sammu reached
his free arm under diabolos waist and
straightened up shouldering him jesu
caught his breath but said nothing as he
rose in air

  i stopped my babble of curses and looked
at the negro with the trapper on his shoulder
and the girl in his hand the ebony animal
stood a moment then moved quite simply
out of tjie cleared space down the path
jesus legs dragged along the bamboo walls
as they moved up i got up and followed
once i said shakily-

  i-i want to kill him sammu

  but it sounded so puerile i said no more
  after a while jesu said-

  sammu my hearts friend i can walk
now

  the negro moved along silently appar-
ently he did not hear to tell the truth
my own anger and frustration were slipping
into amazement i followed perhaps a
yard behind pechita

  presently jesu said again with a queer
quality coming into his voice-

  sammu if you will put me down we can
get along faster-good sammu

  the negro might have been stone deaf
as he strode on with his wo captives
what he meant to do with them i had not
the slightest idea pechita made no sound
but presently with a wrist movement she
tossed the knife into the bamboos i felt
the impulse that moved her to carry a
knife around sammu tenko was an ab-
surdity every moment my wonder grew
stronger and stronger i was about to
question the negro myself when we passed
out of the brake diabolo i think felt
his legs quit dragging the big canes for he

said with apprehension creeping into his
tones

  sammu what are you going to do
with us sammu where are we going
at the continued silence the indian began
squirming trying to twist off the shoulder
but a moment later he gave a sharp grunt
and lay still and i knew that sammus
black arm had given him a warning squeeze
i saw jesu twist his head trying to locate
himself but his face was toward the sky
and he could see perhaps little more than
the tree-tops on each side

  we really turned up the river-bank the
four of us and in the distance i saw the
bloated form of the chilli-maker pechita
saw him too for suddenly she began swing-
ing against the black hand with all her
might her slight resistance did not cause
the giant even to lean forward or throw his
step out of rhythm she doubled over his
big fist and i saw the gleam of white teeth
as she bit sammu gave a little push with
his fingers her head bobbed back and she
began sobbing out

  sammu sammu wrhat are you go-
ing to do with me let me go sammu

sammu please ple-a-s-e-

  then she tried to kick his legs and begged
between kicks she stared up the river
and grew wilder she screamed implored
in desperate babbling haste at lart she
pushed close to his side and whispered up
sammu sammu look at me

  to my surprise the giant did look around
there was a kind of grin on his pendulous
lips pechita peered up into his eyes

  sammu she whispered shakily let
me go sammu-i-ill be your-woman-
sammu

  i dont know why i trailed on behind the
three god knows all thought of vengeance
was frozen from my heart by the growing
menace of sammus silence i am sure
sin fan had warned him neither to talk
nor to argue one word and without
question he would have fallen victim to
jesus tongue or to pechitas lures

when we reached the wharf the
bellying chinaman received the
girls wrists in his hand then stood
impassive as far as i could see his wide
face looked exactly as it did when i first
saw him sitting by his pots brooding over
his young wife

by t s strbling


romance

  a number of leathern straps lay at his
feet sammu picked up three of these
lowered jesu bound the half-breeds hands
and feet and placed a gag in his mouth
then the negro hesitated the fraction of a
second and looked toward his master
sin fan barely nodded

  i believe at the nodding of that expres-
sionless face i would have done something
to help even jesu diabolo had it been in
my power i drew long breaths and sat
staring at the actors

  from the wharf a series of stakes led
into the river where boatmen moored their
craft as the water rose and fell beyond
these stakes were a sprinkling of reeds in
the moonlight i could see the reeds move
in sinuous ripples as some manatee or croco-
dile browsed among them

  sammu picked up his burden and waded
gingerly to a stake that was perhaps thigh-
deep to an ordinary man here he bound
diabolo in a sitting posture only the
half-breeds head was exposed above the
surface it was a queer sight the gag
across the head was a black mark a high
light on the bluish flap looked like a clean
round hole straight through jesus skull
the good eye stared once i saw it bat

  sammu spattered the water three times
with his palm then waded ashore with a
certain haste

  a sick feeling came over me i looked
away it happened my eyes fell on pechita
the girls face was clayey even to the lips
sin fan watched jesu calmly his oblique
eyes batting at regular intervals

  for a full minute i stared at the china-
man and his recovered woman suddenly
a horrible look came into pechitas face i
thought her eyes would start from her head
i heard a splash in the river then a bub-
bling

  sin fan watched the stakes for upward
of a minute and a half with a nerveless at-
tention then turned and waddled toward
the water leading the girl

  i stopped breathing not knowing what
to expect

  a balandra lay moored at the wharf piled
with pots and a few bags of beans -he drew
the girl aboard and put her aiding the
beans she might have been another bag

  sammu tenko cast off the line stepped
aboard picked up the pole and leaned his

weight against it the balandra moved
away from the wharf into the current
they drifted out into the placid moonlight
the negro poling sin fan sitting motion-
less among his pots and pechita lying limp
across the bean bags as if she were dead

  i sat staring until the boat grew indis-
tinct and finally faded into the luminous
water i sat with even my own thirst for
death deadened

  at last when i gained the courage i
looked around at the boat-stakes they
were quite empty

i do not know how long i sat nor could
i chronicle my thoughts if i would
at length i heard footsteps behind me
some one laid a hand on my shoulder and
i saw it was the alcalde

  he told me senor monan and the soldiers
were inquiring for me at the mission it
seemed the soldiers were of senor monans
political party and had come to escort their
leader into peru in a roundabout way the
alcalde explained that he had redirected
jesus letter to a man in caracas-a man
with whom senor monan had been corre-
sponding as a result monans friends had
come and jesu had directed them to the
hacienda	v

  lwanna was with the party old an-
gela had found the men and had told them
of lwannas supposed death the whole
group then hurried to the brazil tree and
had found the girl where she had fallen into
the hollow bole when the jaguar leaped
like all the cat family the big feline had
given up its game when the first charge
failed

  the men found lwanna stunned from
her fall they were guided in their search
by young capybaras on the inside creaking
their distress

  some two years later when lwanna and
i were writing our birds of brazil we
found a chinaman and a gigantic negro
running a chilli-shop in one of the upper
amazon towns teffe i believe the place
was called however we were never sure
they were the men we had known in taos
they gave no sign of recognition when we
purchased a bowl at their stand opium
had reduced them to mere skeletons of their
former selves

  no woman was with them



tiger lure
the wooing of posie grubb

by jane hicks

yes posie had had a hard life
although she was still in her early
thirties and it was a lonely life
because she made it lonely also
one wondered how much of the hardness
was of her own responsibility for she
was born flowerlike-posie-like with the
blue eyes and exquisite skin that usually
come with dark-red hair like hers

  the grubb of her name was of her
own choosing it carried the suggestion
that that of her life might have been too
nor was she one of those much bewritten
persons who radiate the more cheer the
more trouble they have she did not emit
cheer she emitted the atmosphere of
the kitchen of her south carolina mill
hotel where she spent sixteen of her wak-
ing hours out of seventeen

  that kitchen was dark and smoky and
disorderly because posie had not time she
said to fool with cleaning it up she
did not connect her disposition with her
kitchen though it had a lot to do with it
for posie despite her armor of hardness
was sensitive one might imagine that
could she have spent her waking hours in
a flower garden she would have been gay
almost frivolous

  but it was the kitchen for mrs posie
grubb her boarders sought her there if
they cared to run the risk it involved for
posie didnt have time she said to fool
with being polite she didnt always
cuss a feller out but you could never
tell when she would or why her incon-
sistency was her only consistency the
uncertainty of her was her attraction yes

she had a certain attraction she could be
really pleasant when she felt right good
but apparently that was not often

  one time however was the summer
morning in  when the labor shortage
first made itself felt at whites mill as
tek bullard the mill foreman came and
stood in the doorway leading from the
kitchen to the dining-room posie only
glanced up butsaw that the mans shaggy
gray brows were lower over his eyes than
usual she waited for him to speak

  peeling your spuds eh he asked his
tongue pushing his chew into his cheek

  seems like to me i dont never do
nothin else i says sometimes if i was
to go to heaven-i dont speck to go there
-but if i did and i seen a potato and i

come down town saturday night and of-
fered em more money

  how come he didnt offer link more
too

  did but link said if id give him
more hed stay hed ruther been with
me a long time and lily here and all

  lily was links very black wife and
posie grubbs help she was putting
the breakfast dishes through a greasy gray
water and then touching them lightly with
a soiled gray cloth posie glanced quickly
and almost angrily toward lily

  hed better not be goin takin lily
way from me hard as help is to get
now cant you give him what masseys
offered

  i just stopped by the office to tell mr
white he told me to go ahead and jjet
em back weve got to have men

  whats the matter with massey any-
how posie suddenly asked pushing her
white cap up from over her small sharp
eyes didnt he say nothin bout it yes-
terday here with you all day to way
long in the night you ad orter be shamed
o yourselves playin poker all day sun-
days

  he had no answer for this he let his
chew drop from his cheek on to his tongue
and turning walked slowly through the
bare white-plastered dining-room and
barer hallway out on to the dusty screened
porch for a few minutes he stood think-
ing then opened the door and went back
through the baking sunshine to the mill
posie watched him through the vista of
doorways till he was out of sight then
resumed her scraping it meant nothing
to her that he had come to tell her

  cornin here stoppin me with my
work she grumbled whata i care
bout his men taint none o my busi-
ness i got all i can do to fill their stom-
achs i bet if jim massey comes here
takin my boarders way from me hell
hear from me how many you spose ill
lose

  lily walked airily to the stove for some
hot water and reckoned shed lose ten

  posie grubb did not hesitate to fill black
stomachs as well as white as she expressed
it the white men ate in the dining-room
so much per month on credit the black
ones ate in the kitchen so much per plate
prepaid business was business one

mans money was as good as anothers

all the use i got for menfolks any-
how is to get their money she often said

  and all the use the menfolks had for her
was to have a place convenient to the mill
where they could eat and sleep at least
that was the only way any of them had
thought of her till one saturday evening
about six months before it was when jim
massey was assistant foreman at whites
mill and lived at mrs grubbs

  every one in the camp-that is all the
men and some of the women-walked to
town two miles away every saturday
night to spend and to deposit their money
bullard and massey had come back early
that night about nine oclock as they
came up on the porch they saw through
the glass in the door mrs grubb sitting
at the dining-room table her head on her
arms her shoulders shaking both men
stopped posie grubb crying

  lord no bullard said  taint in
her coughing

  as they opened the door and went in
posie jumped up and went into the dark
kitchen and began rattling the pans
massey was curious and being curious
and also being a man open and straight-
forward he went to satisfy his curiosity
he strode across the hall to the dining-
room doorway

  mrs grubb he called her

  bullard had started toward his room
door but he joined massey as the woman
answered

  what you want im busy i cant
come there you got no business back
here anyhow this time o night mumb-
ling on

  masseys large wide open blue eyes
turned to bullard whose small shrewd
ones seemed to be listening to the unusual
thick quality of the womans voice bul-
lard nodded it was tears

  mrs grubb massey called parting
his long brown mustache are you sick
if you are ill go back to town to get
you some medicine

  no i aint sick

  she came to the kitchen door her
glorious mass of dark-red hair was uncov-
ered and tumbled her cheeks had an
unusual slight flush and her blue service
dress with its sleeves rolled up was be-
coming

no i aint sick she said and i dont

  she turned abruptly back into the dark
kitchen and went outside to the woodpile
the men looked at each other seriously
for a minute then turned and went to their
rooms masseys high heavy woods boots
made less noise than usual going up the
steps almost softly bullard closed his
door each man lighted a fire in his little

by jan

trash burner and sat down by it to think

  they had seen something new they
had seen iosie grubb they had seen her
as a human being with feelings not like
iron but like flesh-flesh that shrank from
hurts and stabs flesh that quivered and
bled at cruellies flesh that grew callous in
self-protection yes she was hard but
she hadnt hardened all the way to the
aching sobbing heart of her she had
hardened outside but not so that human
beings with their sharpness and their
cruelties couldnt hurt her

  and because she was hurt and bleeding
and raw she had let the steely surface of
her break and show her humanity to these
two rough men just because they happened
to come near her at that minute had
they been tough instead of only rough
they would have laughed and forgotten
but pity was aroused in them because
like the stately pines with which they
worked their roughness was only of the
outside and their hearts were strong and
true though with a difference in their
grain

  bullard in his shrewdness and even
against his will followed his pity with a
wonder if she could have had a reason for
her outburst having planned it and exe-
cuted it well and then came a little ad-
miration of the fiber of a woman who
would grit her teeth and go on hoeing her
row when it was as hard and stony as posie
grubbs and mixed with the pity and
the admiration was a subtle enjoyment of
tim grubbs soft game and then be-
cause like all things that grow some feel-
ings are the issue of many elements tek
bullard suddenly found himself wanting
posie grubb

  and up in his room over his trash
burner tom massey with his good heart
and less intricate grain than bullards was
facing the fact that he felt sorry for this
woman an wanted to fight for her damn
it and make the rest a little easier for
her-make her feel that ignorant little chil-
dren were not the only ones whose hands
were not turned against her and whose
faces were not turned from her

  and be it said that not till later did he
think of the expense of a wife for mas-
sey was not extravagant

  so from that winter night massey and
his friend tek bullard had been uncon-
scious rivals for posie grubb the desire

for her was not keen enough in either of
them to drive him to court her or even to
be any different toward her outwardly
but both of thfcm were on the balance
ready to respond to the weight of a pro-
pitious happening or a responsive mood
in mrs grubb a tender mood in her
however seemed to be the remotest possi-
bility for since her damned softness in
front of them men as she called it to her-
self she had been harder and ruder than
ever to them

  she felt sure that they had laughed but
not forgotten and that she had only
brought another hurt on herself it would
have taken a very brave man indeed im-
pelled by an irresistible and fiery force
to ask posie grubb to stop hoeing and
scraping potatoes for the mill force and to
hoe and scrape them for him alone so
it seemed that each man waited rather un-
concernedly for the propitious happening
if anything ever was to disturb his ro-
mantic balance and they waited for six
months or more when the labor situation
became serious

when tek bullard walked back to
the mill that monday morning after
he had gone to tell mrs grubb that he had
no crew he immediately found link dorsey
and increased his wages to twenty-five
cents a day more than massey had offered
him remarking in an offhand way that
that was what he was going to do for every
man working for him then he waited
and sure enough in just a few days he
had all his old crew back and happy

  he chuckled when he heard that the
west carolina would probably have to
shut down on account of labor in a week
or so however the chuckling was on the
other side for massey had the men again
and thus it went battledore and shuttle-
cock but though the two foremen played
their poker in bullards room every sun-
day neither mentioned the labor subject
for several weeks then on sunday the
minute massey strode on to the porch
where bullard was waiting for him bul-
lard rose led the way to his room and had
no sooner closed the door than he opened
his subject

  look here massey weve got to come
to some understanding about this nigger
question

  masseys large eyes stretched in surprize

   well its been fair aint it

  sure its been fair but youve got to
think about moren that wherell it end
these niggers know whats up and theyre
working it for all its worth

  sure theyre working it

  but taint right we cant neither one
o our mills afford to pay labor ten dol-
lars a day but theyll push us to that
bullard argued well have to shut down
or else run at a loss

  my orders are to get em no matter
massey drawled

  bullard thought for a minute his small
eyes squinted till the lashes touched

  tell you what he said well play
for the last shot which one wins can
make these men weve got the last offer
the loser will have to go out o town for
more

  its a go settle it when you say
massey agreed striking the table with the
palm of his hand and lifting a chair lightly
to place

  he swung one leg over the back of it
pulled his hat over his eyes and picked up
the deck as bullard came slowly and de-
liberately to his place opposite

  that night as massey strode home in
the moonlight past the fields of cotton and
tobacco he felt triumphant bullard and
not he had to go labor-hunting he felt
so good that he even grew slightly senti-
mental when he passed a couple of dusky
lovers on the road posie had looked
pretty line that day in a white dress and
she had smiled at him a new way he
didnt know exactly what her smile had
meant but it showed that she felt good
for posie usually fussed at meal-time
either at her boarders in the dining-room
or those in the kitchen or at lily

  he turned and looked back at the white
hotel standing out in the moonlight against
the black swamp he believed yes he be-
lieved hed ask posie to marry him the
next time he saw her he had always
heard that two could live cheaper than
one she could mend his clothes and save
him the price of new ones she was used
to economy he could think of no reason
for crushing his desire for her they were
too old to court like those kids hed just
passed but he believed hed get her

  in his simplicity and his good humor it
did not occur to him that posies smile
had been the outward expression of a re-

the wooing of posie grubb
romance -

vengeful joy because he had had no men
the week ijefore and bullard had with the
consequence that she had had her full
quota of boarders

  as massey passed the negro church he
stopped among the young bucks who al-
ways stood in a large semicircle like a
paling fence about the front door he
saw several mill-hands whom he had not
seen saturday night

  my last chance he thought id
better clean em up

  he made his offer it was enticing
that west carolina mill must be a fine
place to work as massey started on out
from the shadows on the dark side of the
church slouched a man it was link
dorsey

  say capn whats you payin now
  massey told him

  and besides he ended if you work
every day in the week youll get an extra
dollar free on saturday night a bonus
its called

  link was caught massey laughed aloud
to himself as he strode-on luck had cer-
tainly been with him that day

  take it all in all i reckon i afht got
nothin to kick about theres mrs
grubb now thinks the whole worlds
against her i reckon theres a whole lot
in the way you feel about it she specs
everybody to be against her and they are
and hang it all she wont let you tell her
when youre not

  he mused on remembering that satur-
day night six months before hearing again
the hard bitter note in her voice feeling
again the pity and the desire to make
things easier for her ending with the spec-
ulation on the economy of marriage with a
woman with a past like posie grubbs

  such was the tone of his thoughts
through the week he laughed when he
heard that bullard was out of town and
that whites mill was shut down he met
the train saturday night saw bullard get
off with a number of laborers so was on
hand for their game sunday morning as
they talked for a few minutes on the porch
massey stood in line with the vista of
doorways from the kitchen his feet far
apart his hands behind his back he
rocked contentedly and with admirable
balance heel and toe his blue shirt was
ironed his felt hat was brushed his sus-
penders were new for every day of happy

thought since last sunday had strength-
ened his resolve to ask posie todky he
heard her coming

  yes she said as she came through the
hall i just been waitin to see you id
like to know what in the devil ive ever
done to you that you should come over
here and take all my boarders away from
me you been workin to get em for a
month now i reckon youre satisfied
youll take the bread right out o my
mouth i spose next youll try to get all
the white ones i got

  and you wasnt satisfied to take my
boarders but you worked and worked till
you got my help away from me i spose
you think i didnt work hard enough be-
fore gettin up at five oclock in the mom-
in and never stoppin till ten oclock at
night now youve took lily away from
me i spose you want me to work all night
too

  yes you did take her and you neednt
say you didnt she come here tellin me
she didnt have to work no more now
links makin moren i was she reckoned
and i reckon so too makin six timess
much as hes worth just to get him and
lily away from me i know you youre
all alike neednt tell me you got em
for your mill if your mill needed men
why couldnt you go off and get em like
mr bullard done

  no you had to come tryin to break
me up and you pretty near done it too
but you wait ill get you if the lord
dont gimme a chanct the devil will i
dont know which is worse you or tim
grubb-or the old boy himself youll
all work against me every chanct you get
id get the law on you if i could its the
sames stealing from me youd better
go come hangin round here after you
done me thataway

  poor massey was making for the mill
his stride was less buoyant than it had
been when he came but no slower his
balloon had burst a womans sharpness

  you reckon hell be back to dinner
posie asked bullard hed better had
come back here and pay me that fifty
cents after i got enough dinner for him-
if i ever get it ready it likes to work me
to death cookin for you-all men and tryin
to keep your rooms and all you-all think
im just fussin cause im mad but i de-
clare i cant keep on without no help

r o m a n c e

and i cant get a soul to come out here
and help me wages is so high wont
none o these women work its awful
i dont know what were cornin to i
reckon ill have to give it up soon cause

   certny the hotel itll kill me if i
dont

  then wherell we eat us unmarried
men

  i dont care where you eat i know i
dont want you eatin off my grave and
thats what itll be if  keep on

  bullard thought a minute there was
no one else on the porch the only windows
that opened on to it were those of his
own and mrs grubbs bedrooms

   well he began in a low tone scratch-
ing the back of his head you could stand
cookin for one couldnt you how bout
cookin for just me house number four
is vacant

  what you mean you mean me marry
you i wouldnt marry no man on earth
not one of em youre all alike youd
a taken my boarders away too-treated me
just like massey done-if youd a been at
another mill no sir first thing i knowd
youd be walkin off with every cent i
made since i got rid o that other man i
know you you aint thinkin bout me
ml youre thinkin bout is havin some-
body to cook for you so you wont have

  no i aint gunter cook for no man

my names grubb i aint never done
nothin but cook stuff for men to eat
always meat an potatoes i wisht there
wasnt another potato in the whole world
got so much to do now i dont reckon i
ever will get dinner ready got no wood
in the woodbox even got to stop my
other work to chop that and bring it in
and got to get all these rooms done up
tek bullard smoked his cigar-a nice
one it was for he made good money-
and sat thinking as posie went noisily lip
the steps he heard her rushing around
pulling beds away from the wall pushing
them back in a few minutes and going on
to the next room

  shes crazy shell never get another

chance like that he thought as he slid
the band of his cigar nearer the end not
many women coulda held out this week
choppin wood and all maybe another
weekll make her glad to get me she
aint tired enough yet

  meanwhile massey was walking about
the mill-yard slopping to look at the slop-
ing piles but seeing nothing but a pair of
hurt and fighting eyes under a mass of
wonderful auburn hair maybe now shed
listen to him a woman had to have her
say out it beat all the way she always
saw things wrong when he reached the
hotel he passed bullard on the porch and
went through to the kitchen mrs grubb
was not there the unwashed breakfast
dishes were piled on the small pine table
a large pan of potatoes-the symbol of her
drudgery-was on a chair the woodbox
was empty

  massey deliberated for a minute then
he rolled up his clean blue sleeves and he
peeled the potatoes hed done it many a
time for his niother and in lumber-camps
he reckoned he could do it again there
was no hot water because the fire was low
he weflt outside and found enough small
wood to keep it going until he could chop
more just as he was putting it into the
stove posie her housework finished came
hurrying back to the kitchen she stopped

  what-what you doin here get
outer here  dont want- she sat down
on the chair where the potatoes had been
what you doin that for i dont want
you to do that i dont want nobody to
do nothin for me then i wont have to
do- her voice seemed to break

  she got up quickly and began fixing the
drafts of the stove

  i just put some wood in massey said
im gunter chop some now and fill the
box

  no you aint i dont want you to
her voice was thick as on that saturday
night in the winter

  massey went outside and began swing-
ing the ax as only a woodsman can when
he took in his first armful posie turned
and faced him her eyes were red she
was dabbing her nose with the corner of
her apron

  what you doin that for-them pota-
toes and all

  i just thought id help you a little
taint right for a woman to have to work

  howd i take care o myself id like

   twouldnt be so hard if you cooked

she looked only for blows open or covert

  i reckon tek bullards put you up to
this cause he dont wanter have to walk-

  massey rocked on his feet for a minute
looking at her seriously

  i aint workin for nobody but jim
massey he said i want you for my-
self little children aint the only ones
that aint against you 

  you mean you want me to marry you
no sir i wouldnt- marry- in her
pause for a convincing phrase her eyes
fell on the woodbox the peeled potatoes
she looked at him sharply

  you mean it she asked

  he nodded

  well im gunter take you man right

body else done nothin for me and i
reckon-i reckon nobody aint gunter

  now mebbe you dont look at things

like everything else-theyre good or bad
cordin to how you look at em theyre

the dream killers

by mary heaton vorse
a complete novelette

what the matter was he couldnt
imagine for his mind went back
to the days of his boyhood
he saw himself barefoot driv-
ing pigs in the rain talking to a little girl
with eyes as blue as corn flowers and a
crown of red hair haloed by mist he
saw the very gestures with which he had
run his hand through his hair made con-
scious of its wetness because of the damp
standing like strings of pearls on hers
his eyes seemed to him to be smarting
again with the smoke from the peat fire

  he jogged himself awake for the eyes
of his body were looking out through the
translucent air over the sound that today
was as shining as a blue jewel the edges
of things and their surfaces seemed cruelly
hard and mcdermott longed for the soft
outlines of ireland he saw it drenched
with mist and blurred with smoke and he
longed to feel the damp of it

  now this is queer he thought what
can it be that ails me

  the obsession was so strong on him that
his sons as they walked past seemed
strange to him

  they were many years apart in age
dennis the son of his youth lynn the
child of his maturity the space between
them bridged by betty between betty
and dennis were graves-little graves in
raw western towns

  hard living it had been hard for him
and harder for lucy with her irish gaiety
and her irish despair how many years

lay between him and those desolate mea-
ger graves he could see himself and lucy
weeping beside him their black clothes
like blots against the red yawning grave
red like a wound the cemetery itself
was red and raw picked out with black
railings and white crosses he remembered
how he hated the row of arrogant marble
tombs for he was poor and could buy only
a cheap wooden cross to mark the grave
of his child he had sworn then that he
would be rich enough to be buried under
as line a marble as any there well now
he could buy all the tombs and the ceme-
tery too if he was a-minded

  he looked around all this was his-
the green acres that led to the shining
waters of the sound-the great house and
its appendages of greenhouses and garage
and those handsome children who would
think now that the father and mother of
them were irish from the bogs they
looked like something you might read of
in a book mcdermott thought and his
pride was shot with disquiet as he con-
trasted himself as a lad with them

  youre quiet today shayne his
wifes voice drifted to him afar off

  do you ever think of the old days
he returned

  thats a strange thing for you to ask
  how strange for me

  why from your talk its as if you
were born new every day are you grow-
ing old that youre looking all of a sud-
den in the face of the past

the purple night at the stars how is it
the past has come to me like the wind
blowing the smell of flowers

she looked at him curiously

i never saw you like this before i
thought your past was full of what youd
forgotten

he walked down over the lawn and
paused to talk to a gardener
youre the new man im thinking
yes im the one

  weve been looking for a steady man
mr sanders told me so im here only
till you find what you need

  the man looked at him with eyes that
were like pale glancing flames clear and
penetrating and strange he had the face
of a saint and a satyr there was sweet-
ness in his face and goodness wisdom and
sensuality his skin was weathered until
it had the texture of old vellum and as he
talked he worked deftly with his long
powerful fingers

 you work with experience said
shayne you like the work i can tell
that its a pity youre moving on

    ill give

last i did a and now that i have
my back ached yes shayne and see
yet you have fian go on my way

and i have too but use and his
they both glanced to whs n the
dermott sat in the shade she there
and watchful her hands on her knete
had the air of some powerful idol
there was dignity and impressiveness in
her size her eyes rested on her sons with
a fierce tenderness for all she was quiet
there was intensity and power in her
pose

   shes not soft said the new man
shayne walked to the end of the ter-
race he paused before the fountain to
look at the goldfish for he liked the move-
ment of bright sparkling things all the
things in the world that had color on them
pleased him he liked the glitter of jewels
but better he liked swift-moving fish he
had seen plenty of gardeners come and go
and liked to talk with them being a man
of sociability he had a fancy too that he
envied sanders his head gardener his job
when things in the works went wrong
well sanders hed say as he walked

          hat the matter was he couldnt
imagine for his mind went back
to the days of his boyhoj
he saw himself barefoot
ing pigs in the rain talking to a  jt
with eyes as blue as corn flow-
crown of red hair haloed bjj she
saw the very gestures with v   
run his hand through his h 
scious of its wetness beer comi back
standing lke strings j be  
his eyes seemed	

again with the daughter the new man

   hp i naae

  he jogge

of his be threw back his head and
trans

v my daughter is it he replied my
daughter is it that im growing old or
that mary deane is growing young of a
sudden its my wifes sister the young
lady is

  as if drawn by the magnet of their
laughter mary deane approached them
slowly she was gentle and maidenly
and had a look of remoteness and inno-
cence that was like youths heart

  as if drawn by the magnet of their
youth slipped slowly from her her slen-
derness sharpened itself to spareness her
fair skin disclosed itself to be marred by
fine wrinkles she had a smiling mouth
but it was from some inner hard-won
discipline that she smiled her eyes were
young and held no experience

  shayne walked down the terrace again

a complete novel nis and lynn finished their set
and came walking up in their white
j nnels dennis was a dark irishman
iwift moving good looking with flash-
ing eyes and a swift bright smile and the
gaiety of him was often veiled he had
been moving now for some weeks sullen-
faced through life

 shayne stopped the boys some in-
stinct in his heart went out to lynn

  who beat he asked for the sake of
making talk

  i did for once lynn answered

  he was a tall awkward boy and his
pendulous red hands hung helplessly by
his side and his ears stuck out and were
quick to flush red there was about the
youngster something that reminded shayne
of his early days

  did you ever think you uld like to go
to ireland one day he asked at your
age i was an adventurous lad

  there was a question in shaynes voice
he was trying hard to establish the cur-
rent of comprehension between himself
and the lad but his questions plunged
softly into the illimitable depths of lynns
shyness shayne could not reach him
lynn stood there before him stooping over
his ears crimson the half-grown features
of his face vaguely promising good looks
he was a boy that always buttoned his
sweater up wrong there was always
something adrift about his clothes now
a spot of green marred the whiteness
of his flannels his shoe was untied and
his cravat also the boys disorder was
appealing like the loose ends of things

turned to look at mary who was talk-
with the new gardener and her eyes
 smiling as well as her mouth
ary among all of them had stayed
she had only thought shayne to
e shawl about the head of her and
the old country would take her
woman he looked around
an odd thought came to
has this to do with
if the person he called
one else than that mc-
d in the house and as

ti	t-v	t f  him this was no way to

h  l r   m l  have been working too

lined it

in the old country and shayne was the
more thwarted that he had been able to
get no nearer the lad who so reminded
him of his youth he felt lonely and
cold

  betty in white with a silk peach-col-
ored sweater over her arm ran down the
path making toward the boat-landing she
had irish blue eyes with long black lashes
and dark curling chestnut hair she was
as pretty a girl her father thought as
was ever seen on the cover of a magazine
she was his own daughter innocent and
unscrupulous her edges were as clearly
defined as the sail of a yacht against the
blue of the water her cradle song had 
been the purring of high-power motor cars
and she had grown up with the echo
of great guns in her ears

  where are you off to betty he asked

  im going out on the sound

  you seem to be in a hurry

  you guessed it she said

  whats wrong that youre running so
fast

  for a moment he could see anger welling
in her eyes like a bubbling spring it en-
raged her to be stopped in one of her
long-sweeping flights

  its running away from the old woman
i am she said in the brogue that was
the lingua jranca between them with
her clever sleight of hand she changed
him from her enemy to her accomplice
 tis meeting my beau by the edge of
the water that im after doing she
winked at him and left him to be gone
about her own affairs till tea-time

iv

again the memories of the past beat
round his head with soft dark wings
he seemed to be groping in the dark for
some door he was on the edge of some
discovery which forever eluded him the
pergolas the garden the lawns the great
houses receded from him they became as
small as if he saw them reflected in an
eye he heard the past like the humming
of bees like the murmer of distant voices
he jiad turned to those he loved one
after the other for help and for under-
standing and they had only helped him to
see the loneliness of his own heart

  the new gardener was working with the
unhurried sureness of a good worker he

was singing and the words came to shayne
like a wind of the past

  the windy ways of all the world arc calling
to my feet

  shayne found himself taking up the
melody then as in a dream he heard
himself speaking

  i mind the last time i sang that song
the pale flaming eyes of the man were
fixed on shayne

  and when was that he asked hardly
above a breath

  the last time i sang that song shayne
said was thirty-five years ago the day
i parted with my brother neill mcdermott
in the streets of boston and each of us
turned our way and we were to meet in
a months time and never did i hear of
my brother again

  shayne mcdermott look at me said
the man

  neill he cried ive known you all
the time ive known you since your
eyes fell on me well the windy ways
of the world have brought you back to me
neill and have you been walking down
them ever since

  that i have and now that i have
looked into your eyes shayne and see
how fine you are i can go on my way
with my heart at rest down the road
aways is the dutchmans house and his
wife has red cheeks and brings in the
beer to you fresh and foaming come there
with me shayne and well talk for the
afternoon and then fll be on my way
whats this youre saying cried
shayne whats the talk of the dutch-
mans wife handing you beer when theres
my own lucy sitting up on the veranda
waiting to welcome you and servants to
bring us whatever we need

  he raised his hand to wave to lucy
stop said neill wait shayne
listen to my talk shayne mcdermott
leave us talk together and drink together
and then let me go on my road for the
thoughts that i have in my head are dif-
ferent from the thoughts that you have
been thinking and the thoughts of you
might be poison to me and the thoughts
of me might be poison to you for you
have got all i have not and all i have
got you havent and if i was to stay wte

was empty im thinking we might find
that death had emptied my heart shayne
and life had emptied yours youve been
gathering money in the years that lie be-
tween us and its wisdom ivebeen gath-
ering and i know that all any two should
have to say to each other can be said in
the span of the afternoon i warn you
shayne mcdermott no good can come
from me staying with you

  from the old days you could always
talk around me said shayne youve
got different reasons than the daft ones
that you have been giving whats in
you heart neill

  neill looked away his gaunt figure
drooped his eyes would not meet his
brothers

  its your children shayne he said
the eyes of them are hard and shiping
like the jewels you see staring at you mock-
ing from behind glass cases when you are
hungry on the streets

  the red of anger mounted to shaynes
face

  id break the neck of any child of
mine that went back on its own blood
he said

  did you ever hear tell of the touch-
stone neill asked looking away

  if its paste and brass they are i
want to know it and be done with it
cried shayne

  curiosity plucked at lucy mcdermotts
heart she rose ponderously

  mary deane her basket full of roses
came upon them from the opposite direc-
tion

  mary cried shayne lucy tis my
brother neill come back to me the one
i told you i parted with five and thirty
years ago in the streets of boston

the children took him admirably
they were too proud to be ashamed
of what belonged to them they were
romantic and he was a figure of romance
they were irish and their hearts were
warm they were young and the soft
bright monotony of the saturday afternoon
had been as unsatisfying as syrup when
their greetings were over

  come on and lets all drink a toast
said shayne and then yell be sitting
down and telling us the adventures you

have been having walking up and down
the earth and i will be telling you mine
the children can sit and listen and learn
that there is more to me than some one
who call just be signing checks for

them-

at the steps of the house neill paused
what ails you man asked shayne
ive the feeling as if it was a trap
and yet it draws me and dares me
whats the matter with you why its
only a house and i am the master of it
are you so neill asked with mean-
ing

  when i bought and paid for it why
wouldnt i be

  why wouldnt you be indeed maybe
theres a fear in me because i was never
in a big house before ive seen them
big cages the monuments to mens van-
ity houses big as barracks big as orphan
asylums and ive wondered what they was
like and now that i can go in he
paused i dont want to go in i fear the
house of you shayne mcdermott i feel
that it might put the hands of itself on
my heart as it has put its hands on the
hearts of all of ye

  the children stirred uncomfortably and
looked at each other

  shayne mcdermotts eyes sought his
wife

  what nonsense is this youre talking
said mrs mcdermott

  every one in the world sits mourning
beside a graveyard of his dreams and the
graveyard of my heart is already full
said neill there is something in this
house that i know i am going to fight
there is something in this house that
maybe i will fight and slay theres noth-
ing but kindness now between us and
when you can still say that tis time to
say good-by so good-by to all of you
and let me be off before each of us has
learned the truth about each other
man dear said lucy mcdermott
you can not harm us come in and
bide

  dont mind the house said mary
deane you should know that houses
are all alike theres no difference in
houses except in the shape and size of
them

  true for you he answered they are
all alike theyre all traps for the free
hearts of men

r o mance

  lucy mcdermott flung out a laugh like

a gay banner

  youre thinking maybe that you have
brought back such a rich fortune from
your wanderings that we are going to
bolt the door on you well leave the
door open and you can go out from it
when you wish will that satisfy you

  he walked about the place curiously
he walked up and down through the wide
rooms which opened one into another a
curious figure with his long thin overcoat
streaming around him the floor was like
a dark mirror and in its spaces were as-
sembled many rare and costly things for
shayne had a joy in lacquers-the odd
forms and searching colors of the orient
pleased him he loved faded mirrors and
rich needle-work and through these neill
walked shy and suspicious like an animal

  he was very tall and of a powerful build
and spare through hard living his pale
eyes blazed at this and that object and
he stood transfixed in shaynes library
which had been made by a bright young
man and contained as many books
ii fine rich bindings as any mans
library should have for shayne was not
like some men who bad come by riches
suddenly he knew what the tastes were
that should go with a gentlemans life

  samples neill murmured to himself
a case of samples

vi

presently his search was ended and
they had all assembled for tea at
first all of them talked together while
lynn crowded near his uncle and pres-
ently one and another stopped to listen
to neill mcdermott

   tis a great fine land when you walk
from the top to the bottom of it he was
saying theres wide roads and theres
narrow and there was always something
new calling me at the end of every one of
them whiles id come to mountains and
i climbed up the summits of them whiles
id come to the rim of the sea and the seas
themselves didnt stop me for the man
who has nothing there is nothing stops
him theres strange sights to behold in
the far places of the world islands that
rise sheer from the sea like the cruel teeth
of giants and the sea-waters about them
so clear that the vessel you sail in stains

the pale floor of the sea with the shadow
theres hot countries where the thick
sweet air is like syrup and the flowers are
no more rest for your eyes than a red
beating heart wherever you go all
things change the skies of heaven
change from clime to clime ive seen the
sky deep like a well and ive seen it
stretched tight like a blue china bowl
sometimes the stars blaze at night like
the lights of a city and then they hang
distant over your head cold and glitter-
ing

  how did you get to go all over the
earth lynn asked

  i was never afraid to stop working
when the work wasnt to my liking i
begged when the begging went against
the grain i stole

  did you ever get caught

  ive been caught and taken to jail but
not for what i took for i took but what
i needed what i went to jail for was my
religion when i was still beneath the spell
of illusion i wished freedom so i was
often in jail at the time hey one passes
through many a slavery in ones youth
they knew his talk to be madness
they knew that it had no relation to life
as one should live it within the walls of
houses and yet he enmeshed them in the
golden net of his dreams envy awoke in
the hearts of the men desires for strange
adventures in far countries swarmed
about them

  presently he spoke of youth and its dig-
nity and of love and its beauty and as he
did he plunged his strange eyes into those
of bettys

  as he talked he stripped from her one
by one the hard husks of her youth and
her heart bloomed

  dennis heart was bruised he had en-
cased himself in the cynicism and now the
cynicism was broken into pieces

  the minds of all of them fluttered out
in search of forgotten dreams the three
older ones plunged back to the days of
their youth-to their time of achieve-
ment-to the time of struggle of love
and despair the spirit of the young peo-
ple winged forth from the walls that sur-
rounded them under the spell of his talk
it was as if the house walls disintegrated
the house the garage the lawns had a
smug irrelevance in the face of his far-
flung picture of the world where beside

by mary heaton vorse
purple seas the white hands of youth and
love forever sought one another like white
moths

  its a great adventure a great adven-
ture neill said the adventure of liie

  he turned on dennis

  will you have things and possessions
or will you have the adventure you
cant have both

  ill have both said dennis waking
up as if from sleep

  you cant have both for to get money
and keep money takes time and the ad-
venture of life takes all the hours there is
to the day money hems you in it
builds gold walls round you high walls
it blinds the loving eyes to those who look
at you

  he walked to the end of the terrace a
disintegrating prophet leaving the crum-
bling walls of their satisfaction about
them he had opened the gates of the
future and they walked through into the
land of enchantment then he left them
to their thoughts

  it was dinner-time before they missed
him they looked for him far and wide
and they could not find him

  it was lynn who returned with the
word of him flushed with brick-red of
embarrassment

  hes eating with the servants he
said

  eating with the servants whatever
for cried his mother

  lynn blushed a deeper red

  he says theres a girl-the new house-
maid-whos hearts a nest of dreams

vii

the sun had not yet risen the sky
was as empty as eternity the
sound lay like a floor of ice except where
the sky in the east was primrose the color
of the world was gone the gardens of
shayne mcdermott marched down the hill-
side to the water and to the right and to
the left were pastures like gray sheep
the stones clustered together and strag-
gling processions of cypresses climbed the
hills as if they were on their march to
some unknown destination

  the lawns the flowers the shrubs were
drenched with dew no sound no wind
the world waited the sleeping house
turned blank unseeing windows on the

world the sky and sea were like an 
empty shell

 then the great house door opened
quietly and neill mcdermott came out
he walked up and down the terrace his
old overcoat flowing about him as if it
were a vestment of some priesthood of the
road

  i was afraid of you he thought with
his pale eyes fixed on the house yester-
day i feared the walls o ye and at the
sound of my voice and at the words of my
heart and the music of my dreams your
walls fell and crumbled to dust like the
walls of jericho

  music the walls come clattering
down and the spirit walked free i feared
your walls for i thought they might en-
close and trap my heart why do men
stay within you when the hearts of them
strain outward to go speeding along the
highways and the rivers of the earth

  rivers and roads dreams flow down
them out of the houses out from the con-
fining walls and the feet of men must
follow the dreams of their hearts what
for was it that i was afraid o ye mary
deane spoke a true word when she said
that youre alike but for shape and size
it was a fool i was

  one would think there was traps in the
doorway and that the floors of houses
was limed to catch the feet of me i
opened the doors o ye for the people that
live inside o ye-the people that you
thought you own i opened the doors of
the past and the doors of the future they
listened to the call of the purple circling
seas and they minded the song of the high
winds of heaven and the spirit of them
flew out like strong-winged birds beating
down the face of a storm

  why is it you trap us so what is
the magic of your four walls or is it
the roof over the head of us and the
thought you owned i opened the doors of
makes cowards of us or the pattering of
little duties that stuff up the ears of us
the way we cant be hearing the sea calling
or the song of the wind as it drives its
herds of clouds before it across the high
spaces of heaven

  you proud house you big house you
strong house you house made of bricks
and stones and solid mortar the sweat
of men and their strength went to make
you you have as many rooms as i could



the dream killers
romance

sleep the moon through and not sleep in
the same room twice and yet you were
not as strong as my little words as the
little words of my mouth that have neither
form nor shape to them for you too
are a dream you are but a mans silly
vain dream made into bricks and stone
and my dream was stronger than you
roof and four walls

  why should i have feared you why
should you hold in slavery those who have
dreamed you theres slavery in dreams

i	am a slave to a dream but my dream
changes like creation the depths of the
sea are at one end and the heights of the
far heavens at the other the winds of
the world stream down it so why should

i	fear you

  four walls and a roof and those
that are within you keep in slavery ill
deliver them from you ill give them my
secret walls are dust

viii	

the sun was climbing up the heav-
ens and neill mcdermott was sit-
ting in the pasture the cactus flung out
the pale flames of its flowers and on
the ground beside him was lynn

  mind the cactus neill warned him
the way the thorns wont stick you
its a strange grand sight is the cactus
by moonlight in the desert

  the boy did not answer his face was
heavy

  what is it is wrong with you mc-
dermott asked

  nothing that can be helped said the
boy

  theres a way to help most things in
the world for them that has courage
theres other ways to get from one town
to another than by going over the road
my boy though maybe youd not know
them for you hardly know that legs is
made for walking being as you are the
slaves of motor cars and learning from
them every day that theres no way to go
about except by road and a smooth one
at that but ill tell you theres cross-
roads and little wood-roads sweet and
soft where ybur cars cant go where the
wicked gleaming holes of mud lay await
for your wheels will you live all your
life like a velocepede instead of a man
with two legs that could climb up the

  craggy proud mountains of the earth if
he was a-minded to

  lynn listened to him and the music of
the divine discontent of youth sang in his
heart

  youre going back to school soon
his uncle demanded

  tomorrow said lynn

  tell me now do they ever be laughing
at you in school for youve got big
unchancy feet on ye and ugly knuckles
on your wrists

  lynn flushed a sullen red

  they do now oh they do i war-
rant they do maybe its not so forward
in the classes you are the little felleys
maybe recite out of the book beside you
i cant be learning latin said lynn
and why should you be learning
latin answer me that what madness
is there that is in the minds of men that
should be shutting big strong hoys like
this full of brawn and blood with a latin
spelling-book have ye ever thought of
running away from it have you ever
thought of it now

  manys the time said lynn gloomily
  and why are you yet here boy

  i dont know he said flushing again
there seems to be no reason at all

  ill tell you why if you want to know
youre born in a track-minded time and
the little blind roads and all the sweet
little lanes leading through the secret heart
of the forest is unknown to you and
why is it you havent gone and why is it
youre going back to stick your nose in a
book

  the worlds at war and youre the
frame of a man i know whats in your
heart you heard the bugle calling to you
and youre hearing the wind singing in the
vessels rigging the heart of you lynn
mcdermott is heavy within you for
youve a mans work to do in the world
and you know it oh dont you hear the
bugles calling he leaned over toward
him his eyes were like pale leaping
flames his thin face was alight dont
you hear em

  what makes you listen with your head
up like this tis that you hear your own
heart speaking to you you meet the
words of it face to face for the first time
boy whats going to keep you boy
whats to keep you from following the call
of the golden bugles

  the light that had been in lynns face
faded out

  i havent money enough to get away
he said

  youve no money to spend on a railway
ticket and your father as good as a mint

  lynn shook his head

  its never money that has kept me
from the road but maybe youre right
said neill maybe if you havent the price
of a ticket its caught that you be its
sad to be caught like a rat in a trap to
have your dreams spread out to be laughed
at like torn rags on a clothesline but
theres always ways of getting money
one can borrow one can steal boy ive
got it he leaned toward him again

  i have it he cried many fine
clothes youre going to take back with
you sell your clothes to the boys of the
school and then maybe they wont be
laughing at you tell them lynn mc-
dermott is running away to enlist in the
navy and theyll look at you with envy
and with respect and as you go theyll
wring the hand of you and its a different
looking boy you are for theres fires lit
behind your eyes and they come from the
fire in your heart

  lifes calling and beckoning to you
all the great adventures is lined before you
in rows for you to take your pick and
its lucky you are for you can swap the
clothes off your back to make your dreams
come true

the day wore on mrs mcder-
mott sat upon the vine-covered
piazza and near-by sat mary deane the
shadow of the vine hid the fine marks of
years from her face it seemed as if warm
young blood passed quickly through her
veins

  mrs mcdermott looked over the fair
expanse of the gardens autumn flowers
flung their challenging colors to the sun
she had always loved the sabbath calm of
things then she drank long drafts of the
quiet waters of repose while the humming
loom of time paused

  on sunday shayne was home morn-
ings they talked together about the chil-
dren and the future and he gossiped with
her about the works she put week-day
worries from her and floated peacefully

  upon the wide bosom of the waters of life
on sunday she counted over her mercies
as if they were a rosary of the spirit
there would come flooding over her again
that it was a wonderful thing that they
should be so rich that she had everything
money could buy that her children were
growing up handsome ladies and  gentle-
men 

  but today discontent like an envious
wasp buzzed about her she had the
sensation of one who finds a shaking quag-
mire on a familiar road

  her eyes fell upon the long figure of
neill mcdermott sitting in the shadow
of the pergola reading a book his over-
coat dropped about him in odd folds like
a shawl

  when they had been talking together
his eyes had rested upon her with inquiry
and pity and she withstood their disin-
tegrating gaze until as if wrenched from
her what are you looking at me like
that for she asked

  because youre such a fine grand
woman that im sorry for you leading the
life you do

  leading the life i do she cried
havent i everything that money can
buy

  everything that money can buy he
echoed

  everything the heart of a woman can
want then she amended

  all but the bit of work for the hands
of you and the bit of gossip with a friend
to fill the heart o ye

  and although she answered scornfully
all but a washboard to break my back
over and a car instead of a trolley to take
me home it was as if his words had
dropped poison into the cup of her content
it was as if with these words he had
opened secret doors within her that she
had kept closed she looked into the dim
room of her heart where she kept her un-
fulfilled desires for as mcdermotts in-
terests had increased and multiplied with
the years the work of her hands had been
taken from her until sometimes all the
use she had in the world was to be the
leisure that mcdermott had not

  im sorry for you lucy mcdermott
he went on when i am thinking that the
friend of your childhood katherine dolan
should be living two miles from you and
too proud to speak to you

ting on her back-porch peeling vegetables

  youre speaking the truth neill mc-
dermott she said and its a weary
path of years that lies between me and
kate dolan neither one or the other
of us can travel over it

  neill mcdermott walked away lucy
mcdermott sank back in her chair and it
seemed to her that lonely idleness
stretched ahead of her as far as she could
look down the lane of years

x

v ky that is it ails me she thought

   vv yesterday twas shayne today
its me

  wheres shayne she asked aloud
  maybe lies with lynn

  lynns out in his boat and his last day
home from school and all its strange
things are today

  how strange asked mary

  i wish i knew she cried i wish i
could tell you what i mean an how can
i tell you if you cant see it for yourself
is it natural that each one should be off
by himself on a sunday wheres the
music an the talking of sunday afternoon
mary deane you sit dreaming and

every one has gone his own way-

  youre strange yourself lucy

  i know it well and why should i care
all of a sudden whats become of shayne
thats a fueer thing too and me married
to him all the long years i wish shayne
would come when we were first mar-
ried he had a bad dangerous job on a
dam and when the streams above were
swelling and the rains fell on the moun-

tains something told me-and now im
uneasy-in the same way it takes me
back i feel as if the rains were falling
on the mountains and the streams were
swelling

   mary got up

   ill go look for shayne im good at
 finding things-for youd overlook what
 was under your nose

   dennis came out of the house

   the cloud that had been hanging over
 him had lifted he walked along singing
 a half-smile on his lips so absorbed that
 he didnt see his mother he turned to the
 right and made across the terrace to the
 grape arbor by the servants wing

  slowly mrs mcdermott arose she
 walked to the edge of the piazza through
 the leaves of the grape arbor there came a
 glimpse of pink a wonderfully wise look
 came over her face

   oho she said oho she turned
 to mary demanding did you find him
 where was he

   where but in his library-sitting be-
 fore his desk

   sitting before his desk in the library
 is the man crazy sitting before his desk
 of a sunday afternoon is it daft he is
 and whatever was he doing there

   he was sitting with his head in his
 hands  tapped on the window and he
 didnt hear me and the while i looked
 he never budged youd best call him
 yourself lucy

   they went together to the window that
 gave on shaynes library and lucy peered
 through the window the room swam in
 shadow and in the far end sat shayne
 his head in his hands vstaring at some-
 thing

   speak to him said mary

   i cant i feel as if he were far off

 	and i feel as if my voice couldnt carry to
 him

   why fs it that we cant lift up our
 fists and bang them against the window
 i ought to be calling him for do you know
 whats happening this minute its den-
 nis sitting in the grape arbor talking with
 the new housemaid

   no cried mary

   and do you know who the new house-
 maid is tis the niece of kate dolan
 come from ireland and i have shame in
 my heart to call dennis away like she was
 the dust under my feet there goes

betty said mary stealing off across the
lawn

  you said the word-stealing off she is
-and her that always runs out of the
house like a brass band was playing be-
fore her and torches following after
now what can ail her is there an-
other one of us youd think the whole
lot of us had been sleeping with our faces
to the moon

  and dressed in white and walking
along as if she was carrying a candle for
her first communion

  betty her mother called betty
still betty walked on deliberately like
a stately young woman

  neill called mrs mcdermott catch
betty for me i have a word to speak to
her

  he made off after her his thick silvery
hair blowing in the wind and his long coat
flapping about him betty returned and
stood before the older women seeking their
eyes for sympathy mutely begging them
to let her go

  where are you off to so quietly her
mother asked

-	i was just meeting some one

  and since when are you meeting your
friends outside the house like your mother
lived in a tenement and whats the mat-
ter with you that youre impatient

  ill tell you whats the matter cried
betty im going to meet the man im
to marry

  youre what cried her mother

  im going to meet the man im engaged
to said betty

  though she stood quivering as she
awaited the assault of her mothers anger
she had the secret and happy look of one
to whom the meaning of life had been dis-
closed she had been a hard green bud
she had become an unfolding flower

  and who might it be that youre to
marry

  its lawrence

  lawrence cried her mother law-
rence a long-legged boy and him no
more in his head than a red balloon on a
string she tossed her hands in the air
let me hear no more of this talking
you can go and meet your lawrence but
you can take along your aunt and tell him
that youre not going to see him again
until the nonsense is out of your head
thee was no gainsaying her she drove

them before her on the mighty tide of her
indignation

  oh what is it that has come over all
of us her heart cried out

  and here it was that lynn stormed up
on the piazza and threw his arms around
his mother and buried his head upon her
bosom nuzzling into it with a gesture
that she had not seen since he had been a
baby

  and at this unwonted outburst the hid-
den bell of her spirit again tolled warning

xi

they walked along slowly as if in a
funeral procession neill and mary
behind and betty before them bettys
head was bowed her happiness had
slipped from her as if it had been a gar-
ment

  do you think it is right mary deane
said neill to chide flowers for blooming
is it for us to say to a rose you have
bloomed too soon mary deane flowers
and hearts bloom at the moment god set
for them flowers and hearts are beyond
human bidding though theres a way to
stop flowers from blooming-a cruel bitter
way there is to stop them the cold and
dark stops them the cold and dark
withers the bloom of them

  stop said mary deane stop
neill mcdermott blooming and marry-
ing is two different things

  loving and blooming isnt so different
the love of her heart lay sleeping her
heart was a gray chrysalis and then there
burst forth from it a butterfly there was
a shimmer of gold on its wings and do
you know what lucy mcdermott has bid
you do mary deane she bid you go
catch the butterfly in your two clumsy
hands and put it back where it came from
what happens to a butterfly that one would
try to force back into its cast-off shell

  it would die said mary deane

  and so it would what is it ails older
women is it that they are jealous of
young things who would be loving each
other and what is the crime that lawrence
has committed

  hes too young to marry said mary
wringing her hands in despair

  and since when is youth a crime
since when must we murder love to punish -
youth for loving they must be awful



the dream killers
r o m a n c e

folks-lawrences folks-murderers and
thieves im thinkin they must be
indeed not said mary theyre
decent honest folks

  well the boy then is it lackin he
is maybe

  theres nothing the matter with him
said mary deane hes a big lump of a
boy of twenty and only half through his
college all i can tell you is that hes a tall
young boy like another no more fit to be
married than a young robin with a long
neck and round eyes looking over the side
of its nest

  well ill tell you a thing or two about
him said neill hes got the heart of a
man beating inside him and hes looked
out into the wide world and seen the
woman of his heart and he loves her and
maybe mary deane hell never love a
woman again with the same beauty and
strength theres a purity in the heart
of a boy thats as great as the purity of
a girls heart and what is there more beau-
tiful than two young things unfolding their
hearts in the sunshine together why
mary deane its that distinguishes us
from the beasts its that thats made us
man its that thats made us love god
its the fair love of man and maid the
poets of the ages have sung of are we to
read about it only in the books that people
write and when we see it come to us are
we to destroy it

  betty had dropped back and was walk-
ing beside them her head still bent

  look at her now said neill as if a
mourning veil was drawn over her and
what is it the two of you want her to be
waitin for you neednt answer me
mary deane for i know the reasons i
know all the little reasons prudent they
are and wise in a worldly way they are
but there is no divinity to them

  oh what can i do whatcan i do
cried mary deane

  let the two of them talk awhile and
turn your back on them and let the two
of them decide what it is they want to be
after doin think of your own life mary
deane and turn your head away while
the two are talking together a bit it isnt
much to ask of you theres memories in
your eyes what would your life have
been had you married your first love sor-
row and stress and love and life the stream
of it would have poured over you and

swept you with it and how old was
lucy when she married shayne mcder-
mott and they without a cent between
them is it mad-crazy we are to try to
keep the men and women of tomorrow
babies for so long

and what affair is it of yours she
cried and whats bettys love to you
nothing he said and his eyes on the
ground its only i hate to see beauty
murdered before my eye

  betty looked at neill hope was gleam-
ing in her eyes and resolve

  what is to prevent the two of you
takin a script and goin trampin down the
face of the world together and what do
you fear no mary deane let them
make up their minds between the two of
them when youve lived as long as me
you get to know that theres but few things
that count in the world and to satisfy the
sweet fresh love of your heart in the dawn
of your youth is one of them

xii

the two young people stood at a
distance together and neill and
mary deane watched them they seemed
to have stepped into the heart of youth
and presently mary deane found that she
had tears in her eyes

  mary said neill mary whats this
has happened to my heart why is it
that the face of you has kept so sweet and
that you looked to me like a girl as you
came through the rose-garden so that it
was shaynes daughter that i thought you
was

  i dont know she said i cant tell
you neill mcdermott

  mary when you looked on me was it
like you was cornin home to me

  yes neill the strange face of you
wasnt strange to me at all my heart
leaped up and i said to myself there
he is 

  why do you suppose ive been walking
up and down the earth mary why do
you suppose i walked up and down and
could never stop-all the years all the
weary years-and i could find rest no-
wheres but in the heart of you mary
deane and in the blue eyes of you i
found rest

  its many and many a year that i put
womans face out of my heart there was

by mary heaton vorse
 r o m a n c e

a curtain in my heart-where the face of a
woman would rightly be and all the time
it was your face behind it

  the eyes of all the men ive seen they
seemed dull to me and in my sleep i think
ive dreamed of eyes that was like pale
flames	

  mary deane i cant stay longer in
your house but i cant go alone will you
come with me mary deane will you
walk down the windy ways with me will
you put your hand in mine and lead your
life with me tonight when theyre quiet
ill slip out for it would break my heart
to say good-by go with me tonight for
the two of us have waited long enough for
each other and since i cant stay you
must come

xiii

they came up the path through the
garden together and their eyes fell
on lucy mcdermott sitting quiet and re-
doubtable the dying light of the day turn-
ing her face to crimson there was a
menace in her immobility she sat there
as if she were a statue of the everlasting
one could imagine the house crumbling
and the gardens whelmed by the wilder-
ness and yet she would remain unde-
stroyed

  im afraid of her said mary deane
and whats she going to say to us oh
it is the fool shes going to think me
you will tell her nothing said neill
and why should you be afraid of her
mary sure she is your own sister and
ten years older than yourself and fifty
pounds heavier

  i know all that but yet im afraid
you make my heart beat and the tears
stand in my eyes and they cant fall be-
cause of the song in my heart but when
i look at her i feel as if all this might
vanish like the down on the moths
wing

  its true mary deane what you say
the beautiful patterns of mens spirits are
dust in the hands of those who want
things and how can you give to the
blinded eyes the vision of a far-llung
dream so dont yoi be fearing lucy
mcdermott for tis nothing but shayne
mcdermotts old sweetheart she is buried
up in pounds of fat

shes more than that shes a strong

grand woman and one that has loved and
learned much by living said mary

  that i grant you but she is a good
woman and an old woman and a fat
woman so dont be grievin that you
have gone against her and that betty is
cornin back with a song in her heart in-
stead of with tears in her eyes for there
is little lovin there is goin to be in the
world for the next few years and all the
fair brave boys lying dead with their
white faces turned to the sky and the
blood dripping from their hearts love in
these days is as precious as bread we
havent it to waste and squander like we
used to

  you put sweet poison into my heart
said mary why dont you be droppin
some poison into the heart of lucy her-
self you should be throwin some star-
dust into the eyes of her too neill the
way shell be saying god speed to betty
and the way i wont be afraid to lilt my
eyes to her for fear she will think me an
old fool

  at that neill turned his head away

  and what is the matter asked mary
deane

  i look at her and of a sudden the power
goes out of me there she sits you can
unroot the heart of her as little as you can
unroot the heart of youth and i feel mary
deane as if the words of me would be as
idle as a handful of sand thrown by a lad
against the walls of a city

xiv

k v y hatever have you been so
w long for called lucy mcder-
mott ive been waiting for shayne and
all the time you have been gone hes been
a glommering and a glooming and what-
ever at all is it he has been lookin at so
you go call him neill and bring him here
for its as if the minds of the whole lot
of you is as mussed up as beds slept in by
uneasy dreamers and before the night
falls its me has got to straighten them
out again

  as neill made off she glanced up at
mary and mary turned away her head

  im goin daft she thought to herself
or else mary lias got a queer look to her
too

  wherever have you been at shayne

the dream killers
romance

 ltl

she called to her husband for lye been
waitin for you to get dennis for me

  and what is it ails dennis asked
shayne

  hes talkin and whisperin to the new
housemaid under the leaves of the grape
arbor over at the farmers

  and the new housemaid said neill
is the niece of kate dolan that was
shayne was silent a moment and then
said he and whats the matter with that
isnt she the kind of a girl to be helpin
denny along and arent we on the wrong
road at all lucy that we should all be
playin at fine ladies and gentlemen

   is it daft you are that you call a right-
about-face to your oldest son youve
been dazzled by the talk of neill mcder-
mott dreams in her heart visions in
her eyes a pretty face and a few tinkling
words and the reason of men is upset
i know the kind of dreams that nest in the
hearts of blue-eyed hussies she cant
see the good brown eyes of my denny for
the golden dollars that are flying about in
the air about his head

  lucy mcdermott cried neill why
should you think you knew better than me
about it when you never have talked a
word with the child

  and why should you think asked
shayne that dollars would make a maid
blind to the man behind them

  why said mary deane should you
be too proud to have your son marry the
likes of yourself you might take the
pains to find out what at all shes like
and im not afraid to do that cried
lucy mcdermott call her in and see
which of us is right or wrong tell her to
unlatch the door of her heart and then let
the dreams thats in it come fluttering out
like birds if they will

  so in a moment they had sent for her
and in a moment lucy mcdermott had
engaged her in talk she spoke to her of
kate dolan her aunt and of the old days

  and for a long time lucy mcder-
mott said when i got to this country i
couldnt believe it was true at all and
that it wasnt that i was dreaming and
would find myself in the old country
again

and did you think thoughts like that
said die new housemaid and so do i
its strange to have your dreams come
true and many a thing can come true in

this country said lucy mcdermott
and suppose you could have your dreams
come true what would you wish

  they were all silent while she thought
she looked as if visions were in her heart
at last she spoke

  i would like to be the picture of you
all she said its like livin in my
dream to live here-a big house and nothin
to do and servants to wait on me and a fine
big motor car to draw up when i do be
ringing the bell

night had come the sitting-room
was veiled in dusk and the comfort-
able chairs and the tables seemed like a
congerie of squat animals the weather
changed suddenly as if september had been
elbowed out by late october and the re-
mains of a fire glowed like a watchful red
eye on the hearth in front of this fire
paced lucy mcdermott she walked up
and down like some clumsy pendulum up
and down she paced as if it would help her
to solve the enigma that life had presented
her

  the door opened softly and neill mc-
dermott came in the room padding along
as he did in the house like a suspicious
animal as if his nostrils were aquiver with
the scent of danger as if his eyes were
ever on the alert for a trap

  at the sight of him lucy mcdermott
checked herself and stood quiet and ac-
cusing beside the wide fireplace silence
formed a dark pool between them it
deepened and became formidable - a
silence that would take courage to break
it was a silence that defined their posi-
tions to each other they became accuser
and accused without a word being spoken
it became a contest of wills something
which searched the characters of both of
them

  neill tried to speak but his words had
winged from him the stifling darkness
had put its hand over his mouth and the
grave eyes of lucy putcold in his heart
he knew that when she was ready she
would speak to him and he dreaded her
speech and yet he dreaded the silence
more she stood-there a great clumsy
woman quiet the look of her eyes weighted
with reproach she spoke and her voice
came to his ears like the whispering of a
breeze in the branches of a tree

  what for neill mcdermott did you
wish to pluck the life of us apart what
pleasure was it to you to put strife in the
hearts of happy people was it envy in
your heart that you must root up our
lives when you came you told shayne
that he had all of the things that you had
not was it envy took you by the throat
neill mcdermott that you tried to rob
shayne of his treasure that you tried to
rob shayne and me of the fruit of our
long years of toil

  i took nothing from you said neill
the warm anger of her heart flamed up
you thought to turn our childrens feet
to the flinty paths that lead from us neill
mcdermott you thought to do it but
im stronger than you and though i could
not make the winds of heaven stop to
listen to me like yourself im stronger than
you

  i thought only to send them away on
the adventure of their hearts said neill
she flung back her head

  theyre not going theyre not going
when lynn put his head on my shoulder
tonight and kissed me as if he was a baby
somethings wrong i said to myself
and what with one way and another i
found out what was in the heart of him
and when my betty came home walking
like she was keepin time to some music
she couldnt hear thinks i to myself
foolishness isnt yet dead in her 

  what have you done to them asked
neill and however is it you have got
around them

  through the love of their hearts the
feet of them was turned back to me she
cried at him in triumph they are to
wait and while theyre waitin the silly
ideas die out of the heads of them

  and while theyre waitin said neill
the dreams will fade from their eyes
dreams she cried what good at
all could have come of it sendin lynn
out to be killed-sendin out betty to
begin bein a woman and herself with
hardly a glimpse yet of girlhood and
what does a poor old homeless tramp thats
never known roof over his head thats
never known the warm arms of his child
around his neck know-about the patient
ways of women with children youve not
reaped nor sown sown nor reaped neill
mcdermott you never planted and
watched the green things sproutin

dreams and windy words is all that you
have you cant feed the world with
dreams nor warm it with words and you
scorn the patient fruitful ways of those
who planted and reaped and tended the
beasts

  and what have you got out of it your-
self said neill nothing what does
the future hold for you lucy mcdermott
youve got only the past

  again red anger leaped up in lucy mc-
dermott

  spare your words for you can spin no
web of discontent about me why should
you come among us disturbing us what
have you better to give than what weve
got whats better than this fine house
and all the bills paid and the children
beginning where we left off whats all
your purpling seas and your high heavens
to that

  all you say is true he answered as
she talked the strength had come back to
neill you say i am an old tramp and
theres no use nor place for me in the
world and now i will tell you lucy mc-
dermott what you are you are the
dream killer youre so afraid for the
perishable bodies of your children that you
dont care what becomes of their lofty
visions

  i care what becomes of themselves
she cried

  all young things dream of love and
glory and youve murdered the bright
dreams of them so you can see the bodies
of them walking around safe and sound
and drugged with food and sleep tis a
dream killer you are lucy mcdermott
and you cant help yourself because you
are a mother the mothers of the earth
give birth to young things only to destroy
the dreams of them youd like your chil-
dren to live the life of your empty easeful
old age mothers-dream killers youths
got a right to have love and ta the strug-
gles of life what for did you kill their
dreams only that you should be sleeping
sound in your bed at night

  do you know whats ruled the world
of men over the ages words thoughts
dreams men die for them-men die for
them in torture lucy mcdermott for
little thoughts the men of the world go
forth and leave security and home and
love so maybe the thoughts of my heart
are stronger and more real than all the

the dream killers
romance

things that you and mcdermott have
heaped together in the years of your life

  its great and powerful you are lucy
mcdermott though youll never follow
the northern lights shimmering over the
edge of the sea and youll never float down
the southern seas where the stars drip
like gold into the tides and all that you
love youll keep from going forth to seek
such things and theres a lot of love in
your heart that no man can deny so lets
part in peace before i harm you more for
whats truth to me is poison to you the
water of life for you is the black waters
of stagnation for me lets part in peace
for ill never see your face again
good-by for a while said lucy mc-
dermott

  good-by for a while whats the
meaning of that

  the meaning is youll be coming back
to us neill mcdermott you know
where the kind hand is and the warm
hearth biding for you and when youre
cold and lonely the bright eyes of the
window of this house will beckon to you
for home this is to you and home draws
back to it the feet of wandering men the
warm place and the kind hand of their
own calls them and the bite and sup
youd give me that yourself for all the
harm ive done you

  and why wouldnt i and arent you
my own flesh and blood would i be
turning away a poor lonely old man from
my fireside and with no worse fault than
a mischievous tongue

  you speak the truth and i know you
do youd never turn me away because
of the great mothers heart within you-
the great and terrible mothers heart that
you have youre more fearsome than
armies lucy mcdermott i love you and
i fear you lucy mcdermott i am going
to leave you and forget about the house
o ye but i see youre troubled and to
show you ive no hard feeling for all the
things you said and because i love you

talk with shayne and one pretext or an-
other ill find out whatever tis is keep-
ing him

xvi

e returned with his thin face
alight with smiles

now lucy mcdermott he said i

tried to do kindness to all in the house
and it seemed unkindness to you and now
at last before i go you see i did no un-
kindness to you at all the words of me
woke memories in the heart of shayne it
awoke the love of the past in him lucy
mcdermott

  what do you mean

  it was looking at your picture he was
it was this picture it was your own pic-
ture all the time youve been wondering
shayne mcdermotts been sitting and
staring into your own face

  he held out to her a little card on
which was the face of a girl that looked
like a flower the face was heart shaped
the chin cleft and the fair hair grew in
a silvery widows peak

  it was a lovely child you was and fine
grown woman you are and here the
words froze on neills lips for the fresh
color faded out from lucys face and left
it ashy and the grief of hopelessness over-
spread it it was as if she crumbled down
before him it was as if the spirit of her
was broken and she clenched her fists as
she rocked backward and forward in her
despair and grief

  wo wo the day she cried and
the very day that my children would have
walked out of the doors of the house away
from me that should i loose the love of
the husband of my heart o shayne is
the heart of you turned so far from me
to be loving me no longer and loving the
thing i used to be wo the day what
awful thing was it that you should go
wandering off down the years why
should i lose you shayne thats been true
and loved me so close and so fast that i
didnt know where my own heart stopped
and the heart of you began

  what has come to you cried neill
what is over you at all and whatever
is it that ails women you were swift
and able and unafraid to fight for your
children and now because your husband
spends a day looking at your own picture
grief and distractions tramps through your
life what ails you its your picture
hes looking at is it that you dont know
your own face

  but lucy mcdermott rocked back and
forth

  oh if it had been the face of an-
other and theres times when the hearts
of men go out of their house like wander-

romance

ing birds and like birds they come back
but what hope is there for the woman
whose man loves the woman she was once
the heart of him is buried in a tomb and
i am no better for him and no worse
to him than was i a sepulcher for i
am a sepulcher of the youth of lucy
deane and what unchahcy fate has hap-
pened to me to have my own face come
out from the days that was to take my own
husband from me and why couldnt it
have been that his heart should have been
turned to a strange woman the way i
could be winning him back

  so she rocked and neill stood humbled
and helpless with the little picture in his
hand and suddenly like the sun coming
out after a storm she straightened herself
up and struck the table with her clenched
fists

  let me tell him neill mcdermott ill
not be downed by that hussy for what-
ever it was that lucy deane could do for
shayne i could do a thousand times better
than her im a better woman than her
and theres no shadows from the past that
can take me from shayne for im the
mother of his children and the wife of
his youth and age all in one and say
good-by to me neill for im going to
wash the tears from my eyes say good-
by neill mcdermott if its going you
are

  good-by he called you strong
woman for you are stronger than
your children and youre stronger than
your own youth and the love of you is
stronger than first love

xvii

xteill mcdermott sat looking
ini after her

  what am i waiting for he thought
and why should i bide here longer god
help me he thought im waiting here
for mary deane with her sweet face and
her trusting heart

  at this he poured himself a glass from
the decanter at hand and sank down before
the fire

  who am i he thought that i should
put my hand in the lives of others and
what arrogance was in my mind that i
thought to uproot the work of lucy mc-
dermotts heart and what right at all
have i to call her a dream killer for

who can tell whose dream is true i
thought to open their windows to the
width of the heavens and i but slipped
the poison of doubt in their hearts she
said i was casting envious eyes who
knows perhaps in the black heart of me
envy was crawling for often it is that pity
is envys cloak and who am i

  he stared into the fire it seemed to
him that the menace of cheerless old age
crept around him

  who was i to call to the late youth in
mary deanes heart that brings tears to
my eyes like the violets of fall theres
cold mists hanging over the flinty roads of
the world who was i that should think
that the gentle fire of her eyes was for
me an old man making bold with the
lives of others as god almighty would
shrink from i sit here and wait with
the ashes of the years about me for
what have i to do with women at all
for women and hearth-fires belong to-
gether

  four walls and a roof i neednt have
feared you theres naught i need fear
except the warm eye of your fire and the
devouring flame that lives in the hearts of
women

  and now ill be goir- forth empty for-
ever and me thats begged for nothing
must go back forever a beggar for a kind
and a warm place i thought my words
like a trumpet before the walls of jericho
i thought my words were strong but in
the fire of lucy mcdermotts heart the
words of me have been shriveled and con-
sumed and gone spiring up into heaven in
the smoke of shame

  and dreams what are they in the
face of the living truth and who will
look for the drift of star-dust while his
body shivers and theres a fire to warm
him hearth-fires and the warm hearts of
women are more powerful than the wild
dreams of mens hearts

  then as he sat there with the wreckage
of his dreams about him mcdermott
drank deep and oblivion engulfed him

xviii

as he lay there sleeping mary deane
stole in her heart beat for the
youth of it had been buried under the drift
of years she advanced as if a tip-toe
for flight and since neill did not move

since he did not speak she became bolder
so by slow degrees she came to where he
lay slouched and relaxed in his chair his
long hands hanging beside him his head
on his chest the silver mane of his hair
disordered shining like silver in the light
of the fire and then as if the fire were
his enemy it blazed up and she saw him
a poor tired tramp and the youth in her
heart withered

  so she stood there a moment and then
as she would have gone he started and
awoke and peered at her

  i know why you came he said  tis
to bid me good-by

  they stared at each other and at last
mary spoke

  and whats come to you mcdermott
and whats happened to you since we
walked in the garden

  destructions come to me mary deane
i saw the face of me reflected in lucy
mcdermotts heart and the greatest de-
spair of all came to me-the one despair of
man that forever and ever he must go
chained and living with himself through
the years an old man i saw and he
was lonely and his days were empty
the tears sprinkled the face of mary
deane so she could not speak she stood
beside the mantlepiece resting her head
upon her arms and sobbed

   mary he cried mary beloved
dont mind my words the heart of mes
sore and im going off into the night im
only a spinner of dreams that i cant make
come true i spun you a golden web and
thought to catch your heart in it but ive
no place to keep a heart at all who was
i to think of you darlin and let me
go now for love that is watered with
tears grows strong like plants thats wa-
tered with rain so let me go quick for
i love you my dear i love you like a
star

  lets tell the truth to each other neill
mcdermott said mary wiping the tears
from her eyes lets tell the truth to each
other its the nature of man to leave
woman but for one reason

  and what may that be asked neill
that he dont want her said mary
turning away	

  what is it he said thats come over
me are you and lucy mcdermott the
same and is there no difference in women
you ask mary deane for the truth be-

tween us now tell me the truth where
was it you thought you were going-down
the ways of the world-to forget the bed
that you slept in and not know where to-
nights bed may be what did you see
at the end of the windy roadways of the
world i know what you thought mary
deane roads lead past houses i walk

the asters purpling the waysides and star-
ring the fields you wasnt coming with

mott-a house by the road and the door
of it open what was there wrong if i

tides with the salt in our hair

  its traveling with light luggage well

while

  and hows that she asked

cold wind of lonely age blew us into the
arms of each other and the touch of each
other was warm do you hold close to me
mary the way ill not run from you to be
lying with my face to the stars and now
theres no use of our flying off into the
unchancy night

  she put her hand in his turning her face

of our illusions and we love each other yet

the red eye of the fire watched over
the room and then slowly a door
opened and then another shaynes voice
spoke

  neill he said is it you moving

  no tis me

  its you lucy is it i thought i
heard voices

by mary heaton vorse
romance

  i thought it myself

  why lucy what ails you now that
my hands touch you youre cold youre
cold and shaking what is it that youre
up so late

  theres  rest or peace in the house
tonight

  youre right the house is restless i
thought i heard voices and then i thought
i heard the quiet shutting of a door
theyre all in their rooms said lucy
mcdermott

  maybe its neill

  o shayne shayne im afraid of neill
tis the unrest of the west wind that comes
with his words

  its come from his wandering ways
said shayne for hes walked far and
manys the sight hes seen on the road
and the lives of home-staying bodies do
seem pinched for he flings the earth out
before you like it was a green banner
barred with the blue of the rolling rivers
the singing words of him upset the lot
of us

  not me cried lucy mcdermott not
me except that i saw the lot of you sifting
between my fingers like the sands of the
sea i saw myself a lonely old woman
theres many a year between you and
age lucy and now put the shaking and
shivering from you for nothing at all has
happened

  everythings happened she cried
do you call it that nothings happened
that lynn should be trying to leave me
and that dennis should take up with kate
dolans niece and that betty should turn
into a fly-by-night is that nothing
then

  but you stopped them all said
shayne

  you said the right word ive stopped
them and where was you shayne mc-
dermott who should have been helping
me she said turning on him in anger
and what was you doing your children
could melt away like ice in the sun and
nothing would uproot you

  what was i doing shayne put his
hands on her shoulders i couldnt drown
the memories of the old years they came
walking restless about me whispering
stories of the past in my ears i got to
dreaming of the early days the fights and
struggles and the loving the days of the
past went whizzing past me like trees past

omzaied

a train and i couldnt hear the present for
the noise of the past in my ears it was
a daft-like day for all of us but its over
now well live to laugh at it yet lucy
me sitting and staring at your picture
what was it happened to us all-what
came across the path of us its a parcel
of queer thoughts like the driving of
autumn leaves on the storm thats torn
through my mind-today and im tired
come now well be going to bed

  go on then she said go to bed
and rest ill stay here a while ill
just stay here and look into the fire until
i get sleepy again you and your past
and lynn and his gun and betty and
dennis the whole pack of you and the
troubles of all of you have upset the quiet
of me and id like to be sitting and think-
ing a while youre no good to me at all
tonight shayne mcdermott for singly
youve let me battle today maundering
over an old faded picture of me

  he looked at her wistfully and his love
went out to her for he felt her heart was
laden with sorrow and doubt

  im spent for sleep was all he said

xx

    i heres the difference between
 us she thought they can sleep
when theyre tired and when were tired
we cant he says nothings changed
will anything ever be the same again im
wondering what have i done today-
what have i done have i sealed lynns
ears from the call to glory have i with-
ered up the love in bettys heart and who
should judge a maid from the silly twit-
tering words of her mouth and was
dennis right then and me snatching the
cup from his lips from which he might
drink

  dream killer who knows if im right
and can i never be sure again and why
was it that shaynes eyes turned back to
the past was it to tell me that neill
was right and all this is illusion and that
i have but grown old in vanity posses-
sions and life-you can not have both
what he asked was the work of my
hands withered hearts frosting the
hearts of my children with unfulfilled de-
sires   shayne he sat and thought of
the days of struggle-dead and difficult
days when the bodies of us were drenched



the dream killers
romance

in sweat nothings changed he says
the walls of my house are dust about me
wheres my content of yesterday when i
walked a sure road lor ive strayed into
the mire of doubt oh can it be that the
tender heart of me has been the grave of
their joy

  the door opened again and lucy mc-
dermott sitting in the quiet in her chair
didnt move and the footfalls were soft
as the dropping of petals they went to
the window and the window opened

  it was betty she stood there in the
moonlight and it seemed to her mother that
she was slender and shining like the new
moon itself

  lawrence her voice came are you
there

  yes are you coming betty

  yes she answered yes with you
going away to the war-and the old ones
cant understand yes im coming with
you theyll understand by and by
once were married theyll know were
grown up

  betty went to the door she opened it so
quietly that it made no sound and lucy
mcdermott didnt stir for there had been

beauty in bettys voice and love and it
seemed to her that she had heard lucy
deane speaking to shayne mcdermott
and she knew that when she was young
she too must have gone if the old
ones hadnt understood

  dream killer she thought no not
this time when the instinct of the heart
surged up and she would have run after
betty no not this time she thought
what did he say loves as precious as
bread

  dream killers she thought dream
spinners what have old folks to do with
all that youth and the love in youths
heart is the strongest

  so she sat there very quiet and then
her eyes fell on a dim card on the floor
and she picked it up and looked into her
own face heart-shaped with a cleft in the
chin then from deep within her the bitter
tears welled up and overflowed from her
eyes

  oh lucy deane she thought lucy
deane could i be you for one dear hour
could i be but you lucy deane could
i have just one hour of the perilous sweet-
ness of youth with shayne mcdermott
beside me

 waste places

 the yucca turns her golden goblets down
 drained to their biller dregs

 a lizard-slender sinuous-scales the mound
 on furtive darting legs

 the harsh wild grass upon the rocks is old-
 old as its bitter death

 in all this barren desert land
 there is no breath

  yet somewhere there is cool dark shade god
       knows

 and mountain streams where sparkling water
       flows

 the high exultant sun drips molten gold
 upon the mesas face

 above a yellow trail black buzzards hold
 their wide-winged waiting-place

 a spotted coil slides from the rocks-and down
 beside the fringed mesquite

 and over all this barren waste-

 the white-hot heat

 yet somewhere there is rain along a shore
 and white surf sweeping inward evermore

by jack hines

galen and fink probably two of
the best known and feared of the
alaskan dog-men had come to the
parting of the ways that is after
five years of inseparable friendship-ex-
cept when their devices necessitated trail
excursions that left a temporary rift in
their association-these two stood on the
nome beach and gripped one to the other
a silent farewell

  but until that final moment had been
put off evaded ducked and otherwse side-
tracked a subject that galen seemed to
need more strength to broach than he or-
dinarily required in disarming a trail stick-
up man who may have caught jimmy foul
when he was known to have much gold
about him-which had not infrequently
occurred

  albert galen got that far fink
knew what was coming and being a crafty
man-angler let his old pal choke without
an interrupting syllable its about old
dick- fink knew it was-ever since
the boys got wise that i was making an
exit for god-only-knows how long-well
lets see how they looked in ledger lan-
guage-scotty allan right smack up and
says five hundred bill bunger says hes
only got two twenty-five but hell give me
that kegstadt says a lousand which
means no more to him than a quarter
sport smith says five hundred and ten-
he was jerry to scottys bid i think
mort atkinson the dago says hell keep
him for me and that if im gone two years
it will cost him about sixty a year to feed
him the dago says hell do me this favor
jake berger says its taking his hearts

blood but if i was his own mother he
wouldnt give me a cent more than sixty-
five dollars

  well i could name all the punchers
from leland to corbersier oh yes old
till price-till says hell give me two-
fifty if ill take his note for four years
well anyway you can see dick is in de-
mand but old pal im giving him to
you-no by god im not-i beg his par-
don-im lending him to you

  fink still keeps quiet but what a look
flashed from his eyes he was born in
kentucky and surely throws back to some
black-eyed cherokee that used to roam
around jefferson county

  its needless to ask you to take good
care of the old battler

  now fink speaks and would you be-
lieve it tears are flowing from those dark
indian eyes theres something stronger
and more indissoluble than steel bands
that grows between men in this country
ive never known an alaskan to fail his
pal when it came to a pinch

  all right jimmy fink says ill take
care of old dick you can bet on that ill
keep him tied up all the time hes in with

my dogs and-

  hold on albert you wont have to
keep him tied up just turn him loose
among them hell be all right

-	turn him loose why jimmy my
dogsll kill him before youre oast sledge
island

  well if they do it wont be any fault
of yours-or his galen added with a
grin

  why man you dont realize you
romance

cant understand turn old dick loose
among those man-eaters those horse-meat
pirates thost wolves-those chain-chew-
ing sons of-those-why itll be murder
your dog is some fighter but look at the
odds against him

  promise me you turn him loose or i
take kegstadts thousand

  and so agreeing the while sadly shak-
ing his head fink saw galen vault into
tom ross life-boat in response to a
sweet call from that kind surfman which
in prose looks this way-say wotter
youse two guys tink i am-a waiter
youll find him up in tex rickards
office in the northern galen called
out from the boat being launched texll
turn him over to you ill write you
from butle good-by old pal

  and that was the last fink saw of
galen for four years

  now this is what caused the new cus-
todian of the greatest malamute ever bred
in the north to suggest isolating him from
the other dogs of his crack team first
there was red fink he was a siber-
ian swing-dog that had been banished
from a cossack outpost because after
he had been shot by an indulgent owner
hed torn his would-be destroyers shoot-
ing-hand off its wrist with one bite of his
enormous jaws falling in with voyag-
ing indians he had been brought to cape
prince of wales from where he naturally
gravitated to fink in nome there was
also gyang fink a mazinka wolf that
so liked bacon that hed torn down many
a young shack and unguarded tent to
get it caesar fink would slaughter a
horse in harness so as to quench his thirst
for warm red blood

  and there was joe fink joe was
bred by wallace the white mountain
sled-maker fink became interested in
him when he heard that this industrious
pup had slaughtered all of his five sisters
and brothers before he or they were three
months old some pup fink had said
upon hearing this i must have him
and he journeyed a hundred miles to get
him at any cost-whichwas nothing as
wallace to use his own language was
glad to get rid of him he was a mur-
dering cuss-thats what he was and mr
fink could damned well have him for
the trouble it might cause him to carry
him away from white mountain there

were nine altogether of this stripe in the
kennel where dick was destined to be
turnec loose

  but those nine malamutes had vindi-
cated their masters judgment and faith in
them they were the nonpareil string of
trail-kings up to this time assembled in
any one mans team

  as galen had said dick was waiting for
fink in rickards office the old dog-
we call him old but he really was not so
old dick was a coming three-year-old at
this time thats really young for dicks
breed but they develop so comparatively
early in life that as in dicks case when
a young dog has an old dogs head on
his shoulders while hes yet a pup why
then hes called old dick or tom or
jerry

  at this time dick was a prime beast
who stood the perfection of heavy-coated
bone and muscular development a great
brain-dome spread over the most humanly
expressive head formations ever put on a
dog his eyes had the speaking trick
the frowning menace the whimsical lift
and its antithesis-the fatal glitter they
were as volatile as mercury in recording
what passed in a galvanically organized
mind this dick was some dog-as you
will agree if i can do but half-justice in
picturing him

  well fink went along main street
his brows contracted in apprehensive con-
cern with dick trotting along complac-
ently at his heels dick knew all about
what had happened knew that he was
wanted-aye coveted-by every star dog-
puncher in the territory he also had
known all along to whose care he would
be ultimately consigned

  being intimately woven in the sympa-
thetic structure of his adored master the
dog had come to interpret correctly the
workings of his mind he divined the
great love his master felt for the man at
whose heels he now trod and naturally
he loved him too second best

  well fink said to himself notwith-
standing my promise to jimmy and like-
wise nevertheless ill be eternally
damned if ill put dick in with those as-
sassins-at least not yet awhile the odds
are all against him ill just let em get
a smell of him first and see what happens

  so accordingly dick had the freedom
of the fink block this was a stretch

of improved tundra up at the head of
steadman avenue quite isolated from all
residential property and an area of about
one hundred yards square upon which
stood the comfortable fink menage with
also the kennels and other minor build-
ings this avenue ended at the north
boundary of this lot but from there on
was called the dry creek trail which was
an important traffic channel to the rich
placer diggings on that and dexter creek
-two busily-productive gold streams
consequently this road was actively used
by teamsters and pedestrians

  dicks first duty was self-imposed and
resultant upon a friendship which he im-
mediately contracted for miss eleanor
fink at that time a dainty queen aged
four months it was customary for miss
eleanor to have from three to four hours
at top-sm time basking in that healthy
warmth the while reposing in a smart
perambulator well-canopied and quilted
the usual spot for this invigorating bath
was the graveled front entrance walk
about fifteen yards from the noisy creak-
ing of non-greased wagon-axles and
other disturbing elements that passed the
house through most of the disquiet
however the babe reposed in tranquil
slumber

  there was one four-mule team that
dick doing sentry duty at eleanors
wheels noticed on the first two days of
this duty had made such a clatter in pass-
ing that it awakened the babe causing for
the time sleep to fly from her eyes and
a cry to escape from her mouth

  it was not the mules that made the
noise-they plodded along quite noise-
lessly as is their habit-but a long-ranged
missourian named smart who was skin-
ner-in-chief to this outfit the persuas-
ive language of this smart as he urged
his mules onward was too unholy for even
us to inscribe here

  well on the third day dick heard the
prolog to this performance as smart was
passing the nome court-house down in
the next block matters of millions were
being adjudicated but they were sus-
pended pro tan so that the lawyers fink
among them and litigants might enjoy
this embroidered flow of mule-propelling
verbiage as it came to them through the
open windows of the court-room

  when smart got to the street that

crossed steadman avenue at this point
he was aware that his mules had suddenly
ceased to listen to him and with quivering
nostrils and alai ned ears were concerned
with a ferocious thing of gray that blocked
all advance past his challenge-post

  hey you mike git on there dont
let that mutt hinder you

  the bit of the blacksnake thereupon
nicked mike in the rump and as he
plunged ahead he was fairly grabbed in
the snoot by dick its the first time
on record that a mule cried out in ter-
ror as dick caught poor mike on the
nose both he and his mate sandy reared
to their hind feet and toppled over back-
ward on top of joan and buck

  smart was down from his seat and past
this pile of bewildered mules like a dart
he dove at dick with the blacksnake but
instead of inflicting an effective cut with
it its folds fouled the angry dogs neck
and he with one snarling crunch of his
teeth cut mr smarts whip in half with
the loaded stock now a murderous
weapon smart charged dick who stood
at bay to receive the onslaught smart
didnt finish his charge the court hear-
ing the rumpus on the corner abruptly
and with not so much as a hear ye ad-
journed to witness it

  as smart was about to deliver a sav-
agely-aimed blow upon dicks head he
was most effectively struck with something
upon his own which when he recovered
consciousness he learned was the court
seal this formidable shattering force
had in some inexplicable manner found
its way into albert finks right hand
which it developed later had delivered the
blow on the mule-skinners head

  eleanor slept peacefully the next day
and all following days even unto the for-
tieth when descended prohibitive climatic
conditions over which dick had no con-
trol driving his charge to indoor quarters

  i guess theres not much use my
wasting any anxiety over this dick dog
thought fink after this occurrence and
the next day deliberately admitted dick
into the enclosed domain of his nine sav-
age trailers as if they were one dog
this act put them in a state of mortal ag-
gression and fink was tempted to re-
move dick hastily from the menace that
ominous snarls and rampant fighting
manes presaged

king rich a r d
romance

  but one look at dick completely re-
assured him the galen dog-known
feared and hated by the fink team-
walked unconcernedly in their midst his
tail lightly curled over his back an
imperial look of fearlessness proclaiming
him the invincible master over each fink
dog that dared look him in the eye

  nevertheless he was a bit nervous about
withdrawing his presence from the ken-
nel he feared that when he turned his
back a concerted attack would ensue its
possible result alarmed him nine to
one is some handicap he thought but
he did turn his back went up to the gate
opened stepped through and banged it
shut in a most matter-of-fact manner

  almost simultaneously with the click
of the latch dick was pounced upon by
the entire nine outraged wolf-dogs but
not one of the ensuing howls of pain came
from the victim-elect of this murderous
orgy the battling general in him-his
royal birthright which even overtowered
his gigantic fighting strength and indomit-
able spirit-instantly asserted itself
dicks defense and counter-assault which
he concentrated upon but one of the at-
tacking dogs at a time soon had five of
them out of the fight and well-licked
whereupon the remaining four struck
their colors convinced that they were
dealing with a super-dog and in so far as
they were concerned he would never
again be molested

  by god jimmy was right was finks
supreme compliment to dick

  he had witnessed the unequal battle
from beginning to end

  what happened at dicks first meal-
time clinched forever after the indubitable
fact that at last the nine trailers had a
sovereign ruler whose reign was to be
supreme and absolute at that time each
of the dogs including dick had a nice
juicy smoked-salmon thrown to him and
when sub-chu-ahk the indian boy who
fed the dogs left the kennel dick with
imperious assurance gathered all the fishes
from before the hungry dogs and piled
them temptingly in the center of the en-
closure

  then while the dogs sat with drooling
jowls in subjugated timidity around their
pilfered food dick began his first dinner
and ate till his sides bulged when fin-
ished he tantalizingly licked his chops

for a few minutes and then contemptu-
ously and with unmistakable significance
defiled what was left of the heap

  after this he scratched with all the
might of his powerful hind feet a blind-
ing hail-storm of loose gravel and dust
into the faces of his dumbfounded vassals
and retired to his own corner inviting
them as he did so to proceed with their
repast which they did notwithstanding
as it is not in the nature of hungry wolf-
dogs to be overdelicate about many of lifes
trivialities dick having thus established
the entente cordiale thereafter sported
among the dogs indulging them with frol-
icsome and capricious play which to his
dying day he never tired of doing

before the time of trail preparation
that fall dick had leisure oppor-
tunity to form an attachment that pro-
gressed in fervor and deep-rooted affec-
tion as the years advanced he fell des-
perately in love with phoebe fink i
can only liken phoebe to such grandes
dames as lady diamond for instance
who gave to rey el santa anita such a
racing son as robador or rose-ormonde
the famous mare possessed and beloved of
leland stanford while that great soul
was yet among us

  phoebe was of this outstanding type and
had given to the thoroughbred kingdom of
alaskan dogs two exceptional champions
one was caesar and the other crag both
fink dogs that worked in the wheel posi-
tion directly in back of where phoebe did
her share in the breast hitch its logical
that dick should aspire to such a bride and
after the union of this royal pair phoebe
suffered no other beast so much as to
breathe too much of the air near her that
may have had in it the scent of her person

  to the other eight dick evidenced no ex-
traordinary liking excepting perhaps crag
andcaesar upon whom for phoebes sake
no doubt he bestowed a modicum of sig-
nal interest

  a singular example of the great dogs
sense of justice may be seen in an oc-
currence when dick made his first trip with
the team in the masterpoint at their head
he had made no bones of his friendship
for crag and caesar nor did he concern
himself with the jealousies of the other
dogs because of this preferment

  but on this first trip he adjusted all

unrest upon this score crag seemed to
develop an exasperating trick of yelping
and yipping upon each occasion when for
any reason it was necessary to halt the
team hed raise a great ado as if de-
claiming against the need of the stop

  he was impatient to be on the go why
stop here lets be on see im eager
to hurry along these were the things
he might have been saying at these times
but when the journey was again renewed
it was perceptible to finks keen driving
sense that crag was doing a bit of fancy
soldiering he saw that his tug-straps
flapped a trifle there was a laggards
play in them it was a cute bit of subter-
fuge this apparent impetuosity at resting-
time that masked his dishonesty in action

  the captain of a tug-of-war crew can
see before him each individual straining on
the tarred rope and no possible faking es-
capes his vigilant eye but a dog leading
a team of nine-eight beside himself-must
have something other than eyesight to de-
tect a slacker whose working point is four
positions behind his back about fifteen
minutes after crag had used up another
rest interval in nervous expostulation dick
suddenly came to a rooted stop he stood
dead still for an approximate thirty sec-
onds and to finks whats the matter old
boy gave no heed other than to toss his
head in air and say hold your horses
master

  he then with cold precision turned
about-face and leveled a look directly into
the eyes of crag at the extreme other end
of the string the other dogs seemed a
bit mystified about this move but being
conscience-clear did not heed it particu-
larly but crag-foxy crag guilty crag-
he stretched his head way out of line so
as to have a clear look at the leaders face
saying with sheepish eyes exactly what
judas once said-

   is it i master

  whereupon dick by a stripping of his
tusks answered back-you know damned
well its you and added with a back throw
of his head and take my tip-phoebe or
no phoebe-if you persume but once more
upon the relation which obtains between
your mother and me and fake any more
on this job-well-youll see

   crag seemed to understand perfectly for
until sundown when the team put up at
sheas on solomon river he pulled his



honest share and forgot to pull the song
of protest but crag evidently had a very
badly impaired memory because the next
day he let go the holler at the first stop
which dick-the old sage-did not just
at that exact instant appear to notice
but again in about fifteen minutes the
master dog stood stock-still and turned
this time to fink

  boss come here and unhook me a min-
ute will you ive got a little matter to
attend to that demands my attention else-
where so please release me from these
swivel snaps and traces it wont take
long

  fink being half-dog himself-and black
and tan at that-savees this language and
straightway dick is freed from all en-
cumbrances hereupon richard the first
walks down to master crag looking like
a thunder-visaged school-master with a
switch held behind his back going after
little willie in the last seat after said boy
had bean-blown a slug of gum that struck
and stuck just over teachers dome on the
blackboard and by the same token crag
looked like little willie

  well dick just went to the culprit and
with a slight preface which read so you
thought i didnt mean it yesterday eh
well-grrrr grab he caught crag just
behind the ears and shook him like a ferret
doing an obstinate rat to a finish be it
said for the chastised one he didnt
whimper he wasnt that sort he took
his medicine and after that did his sing-
ing when he was out of harness truth
this is-absolute-fink told it to me him-
self

  oh he was a grand dog-a just dog
let me tell you another to prove it before
i give you the straight of the kugruk water-
rights affair

  this was the big high-light of dicks
career none knew or could tell of it more
authoritatively than the man most vitally
almost tragically concerned and were
leading up to it in that mans own way of
its telling

  well continued fink you know dick
loved that phoebe of mine as you or i
would love a woman-i dont know about
you-but at any rate as i love now-with
all my heart why you know i suffer
physical pain when laura-laura being
mrs fink-begins her packing shes
got the berkshires or coronado or some-

thing doing to hell and gone away from
me but  ve got to stick and get the coin
my clients get in such deep holes that it
takes me years sometimes to dig them out
so of course i cant go with laura eleanor
and rudolph the kiddies are at school and
father sweats blood in his loneliness

  dick loved his phoebe like that it
got so that it sickened me to see him when
she wasnt with him and finally he
wouldnt trail along with me any more
unless she could go too manys the time
when id feel the itch to go up to the
northern and do away with tex rickards
faro-bank roll that id start out with dick
alone and when id come out of the place
sometimes twelve hours later loaded but
not with the bank-roll there would be dick
waiting for me but with his phoebe sleep-
ing side by side in the snow

  well sir hearken and heed this one-
a legal product of the blue grass suh this
man as ive mentioned before-one day
before i was starting on a trip to ophir i
noticed phoebe just lavishing her beautiful
self all over dick and whispering something
in his ear that made him turn to her with
the sweetest expression of concern that you
can conjure to your mind dick was stand-
ing in his lead-hitch holding the tug-line
taut as a drum-string while the other dogs
phoebe included were being hooked in
it wasnt until the following spring that i
made out just what it was that she had
confided to him that day

  wed no more than got out of town
when i saw that old dick was turning
something over in his mind he kept look-
ing at red who was running free hav-
ing dick now gave me ten dogs for a nine
hitch so i used one as a spell dog just
let him run loose-it happened to be red
this day well dick kept looking at him
sporting along and pretty soon he pulled
his famous stop braced himself stretched
himself put his muzzle to the heavens and
called out fink come here will you and
of course i went what is it old scout
i asked him take me out of harness for
a minute he gave me the same stuff as
the time that he wanted out of harness to
cure crag this time i hadnt noticed anv
bunk from the dogs so i was a bit puz-
zled-a bit puzzled i should say sir

  i took him out as he had asked-t
didnt dream what the old boy had in his
mind-but he knew what was in and on

                   by

his mind by god he was a grand dog-

  and here fink spread his feet placed
his hands behind his back and from his
drooping head  could see there was danger
of falling tear-drops

  well sir he pranced up to red and
took hold of him by the ear and led him-
like a mother bringing her truant brat to
school-right smack over to phoebes side
and then releasing his hold on reds ear
old dick licked phoebe on the nose looked
up at me with the pleadingest damned look
you ever saw and then actually tried with
his teeth to unhook phoebes neck swivels
and trace-snaps may i never take another
retainer if i speak a lie plain as day he
says take her out put red in her place
i know what im doing 

   well i wasnt going to take everything
old dick had a mind to hand me so for
a minute i thought what the hell havent
i got anything to say about running this
team and do you know he read my
mental speech and jumped up placing his
great paws upon my shoulders and speak-
ing right into my eyes he said aw finkv
come on take phoebe out youll under-
stand some day of course pm only hu-
man-i couldnt resist this from something
that i am absolutely certain was super-
human

  so out came phoebe and all the way
to ophir creek and back home too she
did the two hundred miles in rapture sub-
lime by the side of her lover dick

  next june she gave me the five proto-
types of this great lover of hers-this peer-
less sire-and sir those five dogs have
immortalized the name of fink in the ter-
ritory for they won the alaska sweep-
stakes for me twice hand-running and
brought me the nice little sum of eighty
thousand dollars

  thats what she told dick she was
in the ecstasy of that condition and the
old dog wasnt going to stand for the wast-
ing of her precious strength on any sled-
pulling-not while there was a spell dog
running free as air that could be utilized
in her stead

  fink regarded me peculiarly for a mo-
ment after this i think he was seeking
the imp of incredulity in my eyes but it
was not there-there are a lot of things that
i knew this fink to be-but a liar-no
gradually i saw a transition in those chero-
kee eyes of his that succeeding the whim-

hines	
rom

sicai quiz seemed to film them with a
seething membrane that fumed with irri-
descent luster there was something going
on in his mind this time-he paced back
and forth before me i should say a dozen
times-ever handing me this blazing gaze
 think he was stalling until suitable words
arrived with which to launch the kugruk
matter he may have been trying to im-
press me with the dramatic prolog spoken
by his eyes however the words came all
right

 one sunday morning late fall-oc-
tober it was-dick and i were having a
bit of a powwow on my front porch when
a fellow sprung the gate latch and came
right up to within six feet of dick and me
he just stood there on the gravel walk and
didnt say a damned word but gave me
about as sharp a looking over as i never
hope to get again

  that territorys a queer country fel-
lows like that come on you that way all
unexpected and sometimes they pull some
funny stunts very often the first glimpse
you may get of them is over the sights of
a wicked-looking gat that they might be
holding on you a lot of things shot
through my mind while i sized this strange-
looking guy up i never tote hardware-
its safer ive found amongst these boys-
but one of my thoughts this time was that
it might have been well for me to slip a 
into my jeans that peaceful sabbath morn-
ing

  but while this was going through my
head i heard-heard first-then glanced
over and saw dick slapping his great tail
on the porch and looking up at me with-
out even taking his head from between his
feet he had a very kind look in his
eyes dont be afraid of this man fink
i read in them i dont know who he is
but i do know what he is take him on
i-ies timid cant you see hes waiting
for you to say howdy or something this
relieved me greatly for i hate rows and
that sort of thing on sunday so taking
dicks tip of course as usual i had to i
said

   well sir addressing myself amiably
although i confess tardily to the stran-
ger what can i do for you i must
not forget to describe this fellow he wore
a pair of sealskin water-boots that were
tied above his knees with a thong blue
overalls and a moose-hide jacket over an

	king r

old faded blue-flannel shirt his face was
the color of-what shall i say-that red
copper casserole over there on the sideboard
-just that color fink told me this yarn
last winter in a lake-shore mansion he
now was in chicago his hair was
very gray-almost white-but he had the
bluest pair of eyes i ever saw in any-
bodys head he wore a soft narrow-
brimmed stetson hat he was a typical
old-timer and the strange part of it was
that i thought  knew all tr most of that
handful of scouts but this fellow was a
teetotal stranger to me

   you mister fink he spoke after i
had greeted him his voice sounded
strange too far-off like a voice coming
from the bottom of a well it made my
skin creep a little but dick set me o k
again with the slap of his tail the old
boy wasnt missing any tiling

  yes im fink says i

   mr fink he says ive just walked
down from the head of the kugruk to see
you- hold on i cut in you what

   i say i just walked down from the
feed waters of the kugruk river to see
you he repeated with the slightly dif-
ferent wording then he says cant you
hear me do i speak too low no i
answered but you surprized me-thats a
two-hundred-mile jaunt isnt it

   thereabouts he said

   well go on-oh wait i interpolated
how about a cup of coffee

   no thanks i just made a good break-
fast off a package of raisins my they
tasted good he smiled here-a good
smile you understand

   mr fink my names buchanan he
continued robert buchanan i came into
this country twenty-five years ago with
captain green-you may have heard of
him of course id heard of the famous
old captain everybody had well i was one
of the men who worked the oomiluk lead
mine at the top of fish river i knew
the old abandoned galina mine too it
had been inactive for over twenty years

  green gave up the mine it cost more
to ship the lead to where we could market
it than it was worth green went home
south and i went prospecting north im
telling you all this sos youll have a pretty
fair idea of my general make-up who
sent you to me i here asked him

   gently mr fink ill get to that

i c h a r d
             romance

he says i had the old fellow sitting com-
fortably now well he went on since
then i crossed over into the kewalick val-
ley rambled up to the selawick went up
the koabuck stuck around the colville
looked over the koyukuk went down the
mackenzie skirted around barrow stuck
at point hope for a few years and finally
got back almost to where i started from
and im there yet-or will be when i get
back-and im aiming to start on tonights
crust the goings been good there
nights 

   whats your hurry buchanan

   ive got to get back he says theres
planty of gold land up around that kugruk
river mr fink ive got some of it
staked but whats better i own the water-
rights-the big rights on the kugruk-and
ive represented them every year since be-
fore this nome stampede started in  two
years ago the immachuck rush brought a
hells slough of new people up to my neigh-
borhood and two of them were regularly
appointed officials-from here in nome-
that set up a court in deering ones
name is grabenheimer and the others fox
you must know them both mr fink i
couldnt place either of them just then
well theyre well-named those two men
grabenheimer the judge and fox the
u s marshals deputy well some one
told these two men of my little camp at
the head of the kugruk which no doubt
fired their curiosity and also their cupidity
because one day i had this deputy marshal
paying me a casual call-he wearing his
badge and a six-gun sos i could plainly
see them both

   he gave my canals dams and the pen-
stock ive laid out up at that water-source
a very keen looking-over im a bit of
a hydrostatic man mr fink-water was
my game in california before i came up
here fox also closely inspected and made
a copy of my original staking notice and
the next time i saw him- the old fellow
swallowed a lump in his throat here-he
came up with three other fellows and they
plastered a new location on my property
jumped me and took forcible possession
my property jhat id been holding on to
for ten years before they ever heard of the
country

   that waterll be worth millions in
twenty years from now mr fink-thats
a rich country ive heard about you help-

ing poor devils in trouble and im here
to ask you to help me im called to that
deering court on december the twentieth

  no wonder dick slapped the floor with
his tail he had the old pioneer from
the jump usually a stranger couldnt get
to the gate let alone open it if dick were
on deck

  i asked buchanan some questions fa-
miliarized myself with the situation and
the upshot of it was that i agreed to be
in deering and appear for buchanan in
court on the twentieth of december know-
ing it meant christmas away from laura
and the kids and also having postponed
a big blue goose case i was fighting in
nome

  the old man left about as abruptly
as he had come only he reached over and
gave dick an affectionate pat between the
eyes dick enjoyed this i could see ah
man he was a grand old dog

  now this was no childs play this hike
across the peninsula on december trail
we found the river-ice fickle and the snow
deep and obstructive but we got there on
the dot 

  the old man had played his hand very
well-that is in the preliminaries he
didnt hire any cheap local man that would
as they usually do talk too much and
mess up the flax he just lay back and
waited until i came and then sprung me
on the day of the trial as a potent trump
card the crowd that were- set to rob
the old man had a lawyer come over from
candle to handle their case for them and
the proceedings were the usual defendant
show cause why he should not be dis-
possessed and so on and why the property
should not rest in title and so on in the
hands of the fellows whod jumped it and
were then in peaceable possession

  there was no use of my wasting any
breath on the injustice of the situation
judge grabenheimer was the principal
thief-his marshal the right-bower accom-
plice and the candle lawyer the catspaw
that was as plain as day but i did get
our case down in the commissioners rec-
ord in such manner that if it should-ever
come to the big court trial in nome its
production would defy all the cunning of
the plotters it may sound strange but i
used up ten days and part of the eleventh
in weaving this protective net about old
buchanans title and i had my reason for
this apparent sluggishness

by jack h i n e s
romance

  grabenheimer tried his utmost to hurry
me but i wouldnt be hurried i dilly-
dallied along until his patience began to
squirm then came his decision that
fellow actually declared-from his point of
view considering all thefacts as presented
-that on the stroke of twelve or a minute
after tlje stroke of midnight of december
thirty-first which was this day and what
i was playing for the kugruk water-rights
would be open for relocation

  well that stunt has been pulled before
by grafting recorders who were thinking
more of the fees that would come to their
coffers than of the graveyards that always
did a rushing business the next day

  i tell you i just stood there and ad-
mired that grabenheimer worm he was
sublime but these were wild men we
had to deal with and blinded to any law
but possession of the thing they were
after

   will you come up to the ground with
me mr fink its my only chance to get
there in time there was a note in old
buchanans voice as he asked me this that
made me proud of the affiliation between
us it was my first flash of a fearless
buchanan-a man who for twenty years
had lived like the wild animals in the fierce
arctic here was an old warrior who would
defend his castle believe me

   sure i said and we start right away
i saw this coming and have planned to
make a race of it but i fear a matter of
an hour or two wont make any difference
with this crowd theyre crooks buchanan
but you go out to the shed where my team
is and have sub-chu-ahk hook them up and
ready to start when the old man had
gone fox the deputy marshal came to
me and said you aint got a chance fink
we own everything and everybody around
here

  i could see that this fox was a vicious
burly of the thug type you find them
among official man-hunters frequently
this fellow would stop at nothing i could
see that plainly i was tempted at this
time to break my rule and arm myself
second thought made me abandon this plan
and sudden realization that my hide was
still unpunctured

  it was then about three oclock and
the distance to be covered between that
time and midnight about thirty miles
which ordinarily meant nothing to me or

dick but traveling at night over no trail
is another proposition now this fox had
a pretty snappy-looking team of dogs him-
self and got them started just a few minutes
ahead of us that didnt worry me a bit
there was nothing in the territory could
get away from my outfit it turned out to
be no race at all because we overhauled
the fox gang within an hour and dick
geed out of the trail and passed them
as if they were standing still

  fox and another fellow were riding
their sleigh and a third ran between the
handle-bars as we went by them fox
lifted a bottle of whisky in the air and
yelled out heres happy new year fink-
to you and your old mossback you aint
got a chance he then took a good swig
out of the bottle and the other fellow rid-
ing produced another bottle and he too
sung out something before he downed a
slug

  soon we had them far behind us but
neither buchanan nor myself were particu-
larly cheerful that booze meant danger
ahead these were tough customers i tell
you well we got there arriving at the
buchanan camp at about  i saw
a lantern flash some hundred yards or so
from the old mans shack and he explained
that it was one of the jumpers who had
held down the ground while the others had
gone to court

  buchanan produced a riparian location
notice which after i had filled it out he
signed and i witnessed then leaving
sub-chu-ahk to unhook and tend to the
feeding of the team the old man and i
went to his original stake and by the
light of a lantern which i held for him he
nailed his new notice up at precisely three
minutes after twelve

  there were tracks around another stake
which stood close to the buchanan monu-
ment wobbly tracks they seemed to me
we found the fox relocation notice already
stuck up on this stake and no doubt it
had been done by the fellow we saw a half
hqyr before with the lantern

  upon seeing this buchanan said to me
mr fink you know ive never killed a
man in my life but i feel something stirring
inside of me tonight i patted the old
fellow on the back and told him not to
worry as everything would come out in the
wash assuring him that i would stick to
him through thick and thin

king richard
romance

  but when i heard a wild shouting come
up the river the singing and yelling with
which the new year was being welcomed
by the rest of the jumping outfit well my
heart sank for a second pretty soon they
came directly to where we were their dogs
panting and spent with fox brawling and
ugly drunk in spite of his singing as were
the other two fellows

  the three of them had guns hanging
from their hips and the first words coming
from fox were-what the hell are you
two doing on my ground git off

  he lurched up to the buchanan stake
and was just in the act of pulling it out of
its base when old man buchanan lunged at
him and grabbed him by the throat fox
straightened like a flash and pulled a gun
and struck the old man a swinging blow
on the side of the head buchanan sank
to the snow with his blood spattering over
it it was as tight a box as i have ever
been in but my first thought seemed to
be concern for old man buchanan while
i was kneeling over him fox had pulled
up the true stake and then muttering and
growling he stood with the other two
trying with blearing sight and shaking
hands to light a lantern

  buchanan had come to from the effects
of foxs blow and as i stood him on his
feet he almost wept into my ear take
care of my property mr fink youll
find all papers in my cabin he then
pulled a blued gun from his shirt and
broke from me in a desperate charge on
the three drunken men he fired blindly
into them and one went down without a
groan not fox he struck the old man
again but this time a more murderous
blow and buchanan crumpled in a heap
in the snow i thought he had been in-
stantly killed

  well the time for action had come for
me i grabbed for buchanans gun from
beside his inert form as i did so fox
and the other fellow both came at me with
their guns raised to club me to death but
then the big thing happened i saw-i
see thm yet-two blazing balls of green
fire fly through the air i heard a cry
half-whinny half-challenge and this great
gray fighting beast had fox nailed by the
throat and toppled over on his back dick
killed fox in less than two seconds i
shall never forget the crunch that did the
trick the other fellow was stupified drunk

and hardly knew what it was all about but
dick jumped him too my efforts to hold
him back to save this other poor fools life
were like a childs restraint the dog was
beyond any control he was wild again
he had the taste of one mans blood who
was an enemy to me now he took the
others he had the second fellow lifeless
on the snow before he paid any heed to
my efforts to placate him

  then he came to me but not in any
attitude of submission no he came de-
fiant and proud not a trace of penitence
or submission he seemed to me to be
aware of a great responsibility-as having
balanced the scales of justice once more

  dick began licking the blood from the
old mans face i put my ear to his heart
and heard the faintest throb i yelled for
sub-chu-ahk i didnt think then that he
was in the old mans shack cooking the
dogs supper and couldnt hear me but
dick bounded away toward the shack and
was back in an instant a little later sub-
chu-ahk came up dick had made himself
clear to the boy

  together we carried the old man to the
shack and did what we could to ease him
sub-chu-ahk and i then went to the jump-
ers shack and after pounding on the door
we heard a thick voice say what dye
want we fobnd this fellow also stupi-
fied drunk he sobered up considerably
when we took him out and led him to the
dead bodies of his friends we helped him
in the carrying of the bodies to his shack

  old man buchanan recovered from the
blows and was afterward tried for the mur-
der of the man killed by a gunshot wound
he was acquitted i defended him
proved self-defense

  the other two fellows were obviously
proved to have been gored to death by
some attacking animal but no eye-wit-
nesses to these killings were forthcoming
so the people were compelled to abandon
for lack of a defendant the wild goose
outfit bought buchanans title to the kug-
ruk riparian rights they paid him a
quarter-million and he gave me fifty thous-
and the old man is down in the sacro-
mento valley i hope hes alive and happy
hes probably got a raisin farm

  dick well dick lived to be fourteen
years old his noble old soul passed to
the god above about three years ago he
died-with his head in my lap

the rescue

           by joseph conrad
                 a serial
                 part iii

the first pari of the story

there was no wind and the small brig that
had lain all afternoon a few miles from
one of the islands of the malay archipelago had
hardly altered its course since midday

at six oclock a malay seacannie relieved the
wheel

lets eat shaw said red-eyed tom lin-
gard captain of the lightning i say just
take a look round before coming below

certainly sir returned the mate nothing
to report sir he informed the captain later

between the islands there was a boat pro-
nounced the helmsman after the white men had
disappeared

you saw a floating tree rejoined wasub
scrang of the brig the order is to keep silence
lest evil befall the ship

darkness fell over the sea an advancing
streak of foam reached the vessel and passed
under darkness again silence a shout

what-ship-is-that

english brig answered lingard come on
board

carter who boarded the brig from a small
boat explained that he was from the schooner-
yacht ilcrmit which was now stranded in soft
mud sixty miles away near borneo

we are twenty all told besides the gentry
the owner his wife and a spanish gentleman-
a friend they picked up at manila the owners
bound for batavia then for ceylon

you say there is a lady aboard are you
armed  asked lingard

not much replied carter

i am going to the yacht said lingard with
decision i must go to the rescue of these
people you come back to your ship with me

that wouldnt be carrying out orders argued
carter i dont think you can do much-your
vessel is too small ive got to speak to a home-
ward-bound ship or a man-of-war

nonsense said lingard sharply you must
come with me

 

briefly retold in story form

   you would keep me by force

   if needs be yes do you know into what a
 hornets nest your stupid people have blundered
 they are interfering with my plans how much
 dye think their lives are worth here not a
 brass farthing if the breeze fails me for another
 twenty-four hours you want a gunboat my
 god thats not what you want i am the man
 you want-the only one who can save you and
 your peoples throats from being cut you dont
 know your luck when you see it but i know
 mine i keep you lingard concluded

    a squall broke

 it was noon the next day before they sighted
 the yacht off the shore of refuge two
 figures moved over the beach of a rocky islet
 they were hassim and immada brother and
 sister

   hassim and lingard first met in new guinea
 hassim had come there to buy bird-of-para-
 dise skins afterward lingard ventured iro the
 village unarmed there ensued a conflict with
 the natives

   it was in a small bay on the coast of new
 guinea that hassim and lingard first met a
 trader and adventurer hassim the nephew of a
 great wajo chief had come there to buy some
 bird-of-paradise skins shortly afterward lin-
 gard came and ventured into the village unarmed
 there ensued a conflict with the natives during
 which one of lingards malays was killed hassim
 went to the white mans aid driving away the
 attackers

   that evening lingard entertained the young
 leader of the wajo traders on board the brig
 when he took his leave lingard said

   you fired three shots for me panglima
 hassim and i have had three barrels of powder
 put aboard your prau one for each shot but
 we are not quits

   this is indeed a friends gift come to my
 country invited hassim
romance

  i promise lingard said

  next morning the brig and prau left the bay
when they parted the malay shouted-
remember the promise-come soon lest what
is written should comc to pass

  whats written lingard shouted

  and over the water came faintly-

  no one knows

wajo bccause of its chronic state of dis-
turbance was closed to white traders but
lingard guided his brig there and while the ves-
sel lay in sight of a cluster of bamboo huts
jaffir a servant of hassims climbed aboard

  briefly the malay explained that in a civil
war between hassim and his enemies the former
had been defeated and now with a handful of
followers was a fugitive

  you have arrived too late said jaffir has-
sims message is-depart and forget 

  not i exclaimed lingard and he outlined
his plan to attempt to save hassim from imme-
diate danger

  before morning lingard with hassim and his
band aboard the brig had departed from wajo
later in the day the brig was anchored near the
shore of refuge the lair of belarab

  then the center of lingards life shifted from
the straits of malacca to the shore of refuge

there is a lot of discontent in wajo
amongst the big people spoke h c
jorgenson ex-captain of the barqde wild rose
to lingard while the latter was on one of his
visits to the straits settlement are you deep
in this thing

  to the last cent responded lingard i want
hassim to get back his own

  theres a devil in such work drop it 

  by god i wont swore lingard look
here i took them off when they were in their last
ditch that means something i ought not to
have meddled and it would have been all over
in a few hours i must have meant something

when j interfered whether i knew it or not i
meant it then and did not know it very well
i mean it now and know it when you save
people from death you take a share in their
life thats how i look at it i sail before
morning will you come with me

  that evening jorgenson boarded the brig

  here i am he said

  all i expect you to do is to look after bela-
rabs morals when i am away said lingard
one more trip and then we shall be ready to
go ahead

  thus for two years lingard worked to raise
men money and ammunition to restore hassim
to power on his first visit lingard spept six
days at belarabs settlement in return for lin-
gards support a few guns and a little money
belarab had promised his help for the conquest
of wajo

  lingard purchased the emma a decrepit
schooner ran her aground near belarabs settle-
ment and left jorgenson in charge of the hulk
in which were stored guns and powder

on board mr travers yacht lingard said
you are in the way of what i can not
give up for any one but i will sec you through
safely if you will only trust me

  i dont see my way to utilize your services
returned travers

  ive offered to take you aboard my brig for
a few days as your chance of safety and you
ask iy motives they are not for you to
know

  you will get nothing by trying to frighten
me said travers leave this ship

  seeing a quarrel arising dalcacer a guest of
travers started to intercede but was restrained
by mrs travers a few moments later hassim
and immada boarded the vessel

  oblige me by taking these natives away
spoke up travers harshly

  for a time lingard glared at the man then
followed by hassim and immada left the yacht

the afternoon dragged itself out in
silence edith sat pensive and idle
with her fan on her knees dalca-
cer who thought the incident
should have been treated in a conciliatory
spirit attempted to communicate his
view to his host but that gentleman
purposely misunderstanding his motive
overhelmed him with so many apologies
and expressions of regret at the irksome
and perhaps inconvenient delay which
you suffer from through your good-natured
acceptance of our invitation that the other
was obliged to refrain from pursuing the
subject further

 even my regard- for you my dear
dalcacer could not induce me to submil

to such a barefaced attempt at extortion
affirmed mr travers with uncompromising
virtue the man wanted to force his
services upon me and then put in a heavy
claim for salvage that is the whole se-
cret-you may depend on it i detected
him at once of course the eye-glass
glittered perspicuously he underrated
my intelligence and what a violent scoun-
drel the existence of such a man in the
time we live in is inconceivable

  dalcacer retired and full of vague
forebodings tried in vain for hours to
interest himself in a book mr travers
walked up and down restlessly trying to
persuade himself that his indignation was
based on purely moral grounds

hot iron withdrawn from the fire was los-

  ing gradually its heat and its glare in
  a richer deepening of tone at the usual
  time two seamen walking noiselessly aft
  in their yachting shoes rolled up in silence
  the quarter-deck screens and the coast
  the shallows the dark islets and the snowy
  sandbanks uncovered thus day after day
  were seen once more in their aspect of
   dumb watchfulness the brig swung end
  on in the foreground her squared yards
  crossing heavily the soaring symmetry of
  the rigging resembled a creature instinct
  with life with the power of springing into
  action lurking in the light grace of its
   repose

     a pair of stewards in white jackets with
  brass buttons appeared on deck and began
  to flit about without a sound agile and
  spectral laying the table for dinner on the
  flat top of the cabin skylight the sun
  drifting away toward other lands toward
  other seas toward other men the sun all
  red in a cloudless sky raked the yacht with
  a parting salvo of crimson rays that shat-
  tered themselves into sparks of fire upon
  the crystal and silver of the dinner-ser-
  vice put a short flame into the blades of
  knives and spread a rosy tint over the
  white of plates a trail of purple such as
  a smear of blood on a blue shield lay over
  the sea

    on sitting down mr travers alluded
  in a vexed tone tq the necessity of living
  on preserves all the stock of fresh provi-
  sions for the passage to batavia having
  been already consumed it was distinctly
  unpleasant

    i dont travel for my pleasure how-
  ever he added and the belief that the
  sacrifice of my time and comfort will be
  productive of some good to the world at
  large would make up for any amount of
  privations

    edith and dalcacer seemed unable to
  shake off altogether a strong aversion to
  talk and the conversation like an expir-
  ing breeze kept on dying out repeatedly
  after each languid gust the large silence
  of the horizon the profound repose of all
  things visible enveloping the bodies and
  penetrating the souls with their quieting
  influence stilled thought as well as voice
  for a long time no one spoke behind the
  taciturnity of the masters the servants hov-
  ered without noise

     suddenly mr travers as if concluding
  a train of thought muttered aloud

  i own with regret i did in a measure
lose my temper but then you will admit
that the existence of such a man is a dis-
grace to civilization

  this remark was not taken up and he
returned for a time to the nursing of his
indignation at the bottom of which like
a monster in a fog crept a bizarre feeling
of personal resentment the sense of bitter
and inexplicable rancor he waved away
an offered dish

  this coast he began again has been
placed under the sole protection of holland
by the treaty of  and the neglect of
solemn engagements so characteristic of
most continental governments shows itself
even in such trifling occurrences as this one

  both his hearers felt vividly the urgent
necessity to hear no more dalcacer un-
comfortable on a camp-stool sat stiff and
stared strongly as if hypnotized by the
glass stopper of a carajc edith turned
a little sideways and leaning on her elbow
rested her head on the palm of her hand
like one tanking about matters of pro-
found import mr travers talked he
talked inflexibly in a harsh blank voice
as if reading a proclamation and with that
air he always had whether listening or
talking of his whole attention being scrup-
ulously concentrated upon himself the
other two as if in a state -of incomplete
trance had their ears assailed by single
words by loose ends of sentences by
quoted fragments of official verbiage

  an international understanding-the
duty to civilize-failed to carry out-com-
pact-canning- dalcacer became at-
tentive for a moment not that this
attempt almost amusing in its impudence
influences my opinion i wont admit the
possibility of any violence being offered to
people of our position it is the moral
aspect of such an incident i am desirous
of criticizing

  here dalcacer lost himself again in the
brusk recollection of edith and immada
looking at each other-the beginning and
the end the flower and the leaf the phrase
and the cry mr travers voice went on
dogmatic and obstinate for a long time
the end came with a certain vehemence

and if the inferior race must perish
it is a gain a step toward the perfecting
of humanity which is the aim of progress
he ceased the sparks of sunset in

crystals and silver had gone out and
around the yacht the expanse of coast and
shallows seemed to await unmoved the
coming of utter darkness the dinner was
over a long time ago and the patient stew-
ards had been waiting at his back indif-
ferent in the downpour of words like sen-
tries under a shower

  edith rose nervously and going aft began
to gaze at the coast behind her the sun
sunk already seemed to force through the
mass of waters the glow of an unextinguish-
able fire and below her feet on each side
of the yacht the lustrous sea as if re-
flecting the color of her eyes was tinged
a somber violet hue

  dalcacer came up with quiet footsteps
and for some time they leaned side by
side over the rail in silence then he
said-how quiet it is and she seemed
to perceive that the quietness of that
evening was more profound and more sig-
nificant than ever before almost without
knowing it she murmured-its like a
dream another long silence ensued the
tranquillity of the universe had such an
august ampleness that the sounds remained
on the lips as if checked by the fear of
profanation the sky was limpid like a
diamond and under the last gleams of sun-
set the night was spreading its veil over
the earth there was something precious
and soothing in the beautifully serene end
of that expiring day of the day vibrating
glittering and ardent and dying now in
infinite peace without a stir without a
tremor without a sigh-in the certitude
of resurrection

  then all at once the shadows deepened
swiftly the stars came out in a crowd
scattering a rain of pale sparks upon the
blackness of the water while the coast
stretched low down a durk belt without a
gleam above it the top-hamper of the
brig loomed indistinct and high

   she spoke first

  how unnaturally quiet it is like a
desert of land and water without a living
soul

  one man at least dwells in it said
dalcacer lightly and if he is to be be-
lieved there are other men full of evil
intentions

  do you think its true

  before answering dalcacer tried to see
the expression of her face but the obscur-
ity was too profound already

by sep

nce ---- g

  how can one see a dark truth on such
a dark night he said evasively but it
is easy to believe in evil here or any-
where else

  she seemed to be lost in thought for a
while 

  and that man she asked

  after some time dalcacer began to speak
slowly

  rough uncommon decidedly uncom-
mon of his kind not at all what don
martin thinks him to be for the rest-
mysterious to me he is your country-
man after all-

  she seemed quite surprized by that
view

  yes she said slowly but you know
i can not-what shall i say-imagine him
at all he has nothing in common with
the mankind i know there is nothing
to begin upon how does such a man
live what are his thoughts his actions
his affections his-

  his conventions suggested dalcacer
that includes everything

  mr travers appeared suddenly behind
them with a glowing cigar in his teeth
he took it between his fingers to declare
with persistent acrimony that no amount
of scoundrelly intimidation would pre-
vent him from having his usual walk
there was about three hundred yards to
the southward of the yacht a sandbank
nearly a mile long gleaming a silvery white
in the darkness plumetted in the center
with a thicket of dry bushes that rustled
very loud in the slightest stir of the heavy
night air the day after the stranding they
had landed on it to stretch their legs a
bit as the sailing-master defined it and
every evening sincef as if exercising a priv-
ilege or performing a duty the three paced
there for an hour backward and forward
lost in dusky immensity threading at the
edge of water the belt of damp sand
smooth level elastic to the touch like
living flesh and sweating a little under the
pressure of their feet

  this time dalcacer alone followed mr
travers edith heard them get into the
yachts smallest boat and the night-
watchman tugging at a pair of sculls
pulled them off to the nearest point then
the man returned he came up the ladder
and she heard him say to some one on
deck-

  orders to go back in an hour

somnolent unbreathing repose took pos-

after a time this absolute silence
which she almost could feel pressing
upon her on all sides induced in edith a
state of hallucination she saw herself
standing alone at the end of time on the
brink of days all was unmoving as if
the dawn would never come the stars
would never fade the sun would never
rise any more all was mute still dead-
as if the shadow of the outer darkness the
shadow of the uninterrupted of the ever-
lasting night that fills the universe the
shadow of the night so profound and so
vast that the blazing suns lost in it are
only like sparks like pin-points of lire
the restless shadow that like a suspicion
of an evil truth darkens everything upon
the earth on its passage had gone to her
had enveloped her had stood arrested as
if to remain with her forever

  and there was such a finalty in that
illusion such an accord with the trend of
her thought that when she murmured into
the darkness a faint so be it she seemed
to have spoken one of those sentences
that resume and close a life

  as a young girl often reproved for her
romantic ideas she had dreams where the
sincerity of a great passion appeared like
the ideal fulfilment and the only truth of
life entering the world she discovered
that ideal to be unattainable because the
world is too prudent to be sincere then
she hoped that she could find the truth of
life in ambition which she understood as a
life-long devotion to some unselfish idea
mr travers name was on mens lips he
seemed capable of enthusiasm and of de-
votion he impressed her imagination by
his impenetrability she married him
found him enthusiastically devoted to the
nursing of his own career and had nothing
to hope for now

  that her husband should be bewildered
by the curious misunderstanding which
had taken place and also permanently
grieved by her disloyalty to his respectable
ideals was only natural he was however
perfectly satisfied with her beauty her
brilliance and her useful connections she
was admired she was envied she was sur-

rounded by splendor and adulation the
days went on rapid brilliant uniform
without a glimpse of sincerity or true pas-
sion without a single true emotion-not
even that of a great sorrow and swiftly
and stealthily they had led her on and on
to this evening to this coast to this sea
to this moment of time and to this spot on
the earths surface where she felt unerr-
ingly that the moving shadow of the un-
broken night had stood still to remain with
her forever

  so be it she murmured resigned and
defiant at the mute and smooth obscurity
that hung before her eyes in a black cur-
tain without a fold and as if in answer
to that whisper a lantern was run up to
the foreyard-arm of the brig she saw it
ascend swinging for a short space and
suddenly remain motionless on the air
piercing the dense night between the two
vessels by its glance of flame that strong
and steady seemed from afar to fall upon
her alone

  her thoughts like a fascinated moth
went fluttering toward that light-this-
that man-that girl who had known war
danger seen death near had obtained evi-
dently the devotion of that man the oc-
currences of the afternoon had been strange
in themselves but what struck her artistic
side was the vigor of their presentation
they outlined themselves before her mem-
ory with the clear simplicity of events re-
lated in some immortal legend they were
mysterious but she felt certain they were
founded on something that was absolutely
true they embodied artless and master-
ful feelings such no doubt as swayed
mankind in the simplicity of its youth
their very setting this land without form
these shallows where the earth and sea
were mingled together within the circle
of the firmament seemed to belong to the
dawn of creation

  the fate that ruled those beings she had
seen must have had that seductive sim-
plicity which a mature mankind had man-
aged to explain away to its own complete
satisfaction not being satisfied herself
she envied for a moment the lot of that
humble and obscure sister nothing stood
between that girl and the truth of her
sensations she could be sincerely coura-
geous and tender and passionate and--
well-ferocious why not ferocious she
could know the truth of terror-and of

affection absolutely without artificial
trammels without the pain of restraint

  thinking of what such life could be she
felt invaded by that inexplicable exaltation
the consciousness of their physical capaci
ties so often given- to intellectual beings
she glowed with a sudden persuasion that
she also could be equal to such an exist-
ence and her heart was dilated with a
momentary longing to know the naked
truth of things the naked truth of life and
passion buried under the growth of cen-
turies

  she glowed and suddenly she quivered
with the shock of coming to herself as if
she had fallen down from a star there
was a sound of rippling water and a shape-
less mass glided out of the dark void she
confronted a voice below her feet said-
i made you out-on the sky

  a cry of surprize expired on her lips
and she could only peer- downward lin-
gard alone in the brigs dingey with an-
other stroke sent the light boat nearly
under the counter laid his sculls in and
rose from the thwart his head anti
shoulders loomed up alongside and he had
the appearance of standing upon the sea
he looked up at the pale oval of her face
involuntarily she made a movement of
retreat

  stop he said anxiously dont speak
loud no one must know where do
your people think themselves i wonder in

a dock at home and you-

  my husband is not on board she in-
terrupted hurriedly

  i know

   she bent a little more over the rail
then you are having us watched why
somebody must watch your people
keep such a good lookout-dont they
yes ever since dark one of my boats has
been dodging astern here in the deep wa-
ter i swore to myself i would never see
one of you never speak to one of you here
that i would be dumb blind dead do
you know what that means deaf too
no matter who shouted and-here i am
while he was speaking her alarm and
mistrust were replaced by an immense
curiosity burning yet quiet too as if be-
fore the inevitable work of destiny after
the first gust of emotion it seemed natural
that he should be there speaking that she
should listen-and presently speak herself
she looked downward at him his head

was bared and with one hand upon the
ships side he seemed to be thinking deeply

  because you had something more to
tell us she suggested gently

  a moment of profound silence ensued
yes he said in a low tone and without
moving in the least

  would you come on board and wait
she asked

  who i he lifted his head so quick
as to startle her i have nothing to say
to him and ill never put my foot on
board this craft ive been told to go
thats enough

he is accustomed to be addressed defer-
entially she said after a pause and

you-

  who is he asked lingard simply
these three words seemed to her to scat-
ter her past in the air-like smoke they
robbed all the multitude of mankind of
every vestige of importance she was
amazed to find that on this night in this
place there could be no adequate answer
to the searching naiveness of that ques-
tion

  i didnt ask for much lingard began
again did i only that you all should
come on board my brig for five days
thats all give me the time to see to
turn around i told him it was the only
way to save you all and at the same time-
do i look like a liar there are things i
could not tell him i couldnt explain-i
couldnt-not to him-to no man-to no
man in the world-

  his voice dropped to myself he mur-
mured as if in a dream

  we have remained unmolested so long
here said mrs travers a little unstead-
ily that it makes it very difficult to be-
lieve in danger now we saw no one all
these days except those two people who
came for you if you may not ex-
plain-

  of course you cant be expected to see
through a wall broke in lingard this
coasts like a wall but i know whats on
the other side it was i wjjo stirred them
up and now you come-people of my
own skin as they say must i fight them
must i i said to myself i wouldnt
i hadnt seen you then  had forgotten
you were on board this yacht a yacht

eyes on her i could fancy she hadnt been

my eyes to look for the old coast-for tor-
bay by heavens for brixham nothing
but the look of her spars made me think
of old times and then the faces of the
chaps on board i seemed to know them
all it was like home-coming to me when
i wasnt thinking of it and i hated the
sight of you all

  if we are exposed to any peril she
said after a pause during which she tried
to penetrate the secret of passion hidden
behind that mans words it need not
affect you our other boat is gone to the
straits and effective help is sure to come
very soon

  affect me is that precious watchman
of yours coming aft i dont want any-
body to know i came here again begging
even of you is he coming aft listen
ive stopped your other boat

  his head and shoulders disappeared as
if he had dived into a denser layer of
obscurity floating on the water the
watchman who had the intention to stretch
himself in one of the deck chairs catching
sight of the owners wife walked straight
to the lamp that hung under the ridge pole
of the awning and after fumbling with it
for a time went away forward with an in-
dolent gait

  you dared she whispered down in an
intense tone and directly his head
emerged again below her with an upturned
face

  i hadnt many minutes to think about
it it was dare-or give up the help
from the straits would have been too late
anyhow if i hadnt the power to keep you
safe and if i had the power i could see
you through it all-alone i expected to
find a reasonable man to talk to i ought
to have known better you come from
too far to understand these things well
i dared ive sent after your other boat a
fellow who with me at his back would
try to stop the governor of the straits him-
self he will do it perhaps its done al-
ready you have nothing to look for but
i am here you said you believed i meant

well-

  yes she murmured

  thats why i am here talking to you
i thought i would tell you everything i
had to begin with this business about the
boat and what do you think of me now
ive cut you off from the rest of the earth
you people would disappear like a stone in

the water you left one foreign port for
another whos there to trouble about
what became of you who would know
who could guess it would be months
before they began to stir

  i understand she said steadily we
are helpless

  and alone he added

  after a pause she said in a deliberate
restrained voice

  what does this mean-plunder cap-
tivity

  it would have meant death if i hadnt
been here he answered

  but you have the power to-

  why do you think you are alive yet
he cried jorgenson has been arguing
with them there on shore he went on
more calmly with a swing of his arm to-
ward where the night seemed darkest do
you think he would have kept them back
if they hadnt expected me every day
his words would have been nothing with-
out my fist

  she heard a dull blow struck on the side
df the yacht and concealed in the same
darkness that wrapped the unconcern of
the earth and sea the fury and the pain
of hearts she smiled above his head fas-
cinated by the simplicity of images and
expressions she was only half conscious
of that smile which lingered unseen on her
lips in the beginning of amused compas-
sion that seemed to detect in the obscurity
of the night in the words of the man a
naive and dramatic intensity gradually
she lost herself in a mood of dreaminess
altogether disconnected from the fantastic
circumstances of its birth it came up
within her uncalled like a memory and
like a memory wavering and absorbing
less still than the sea more obscure than
the night as strangely simple as the man
silent there below her feet-vast enough
to contain the germs of all the emotions

  lingard made a brusk movement the
lively little boat being unsteady under him
and she spoke slowly absently as if her
thought had been lost in the vagueness of
her sensations

  and this-this-jorgenson you said
who is he

  a man he answered a man like my-
self

  like yourself

  just like myself he said with strange
reluctance as if admitting a painful truth



the rescue
more sense perhaps but less luck
though since your yacht has turned up
here i begin to think that mine is nothing
much to boast of either

  is our presence here so fatal

  it may be death to some worse than
death to me you saw the man and the
girl here if the thing failed i believe she
would die and it rests with you in a way
think of that she has done no harm to
you i can never lind such another chance
again but thats nothing two years of
life gone by the board but thats noth-
ing a man who has saved my life once
and who i passed my word to would think
i had thrown him over let that go too
listen as true as i stand here in my boat
talking to you i believe the girl would
die of grief

  you love her she said softly

  like my own daughter he cried low
she said oh faintly and for a mo-
ment there was a silence then he began
again

  look here when i was a boy in a
trawler and i looked at you yacht people
in the channel ports you were as strange
to me as the malays here are strange to
you i am no nearer to your kind now
than you are to that man and that girl
i left home sixteen years ago and fought
my way all round the earth i had the
time to forget where i began what are
you to me against these two if i was
to die here on the spot would you care
no one would care at home no one in
the whole world-but these two

  what can i do she asked and waited
he seemed to reflect then lifting his
head spoke gently

  do you understand the danger you are
in are you afraid

  i understand the expression you used
of course understand the danger she
went on immediately no-decidedly no
i can hardly realize you are speaking to
me and-honestly-i am not afraid
arent you he said in a disappointed
voice perhaps you dont believe me
i believed you though when you said you
were sure i meant well i trusted you
enough to come here asking for your help
-telling you what no one knows

  you mistake me she said with im-
pulsive earnestness this is so extraordi-
nary unusual sudden outside my ex-
perience

  aye  he murmured what could you
know of danger and trouble you but

perhaps by thinking it over-

  you want me to think myself into a
fright she laughed lightly and in the
gloom of his thoughts this flash of joyous
sound was incongruous and almost ter-
rible next moment the illumined night
appeared brilliant like day warm like sun-
shine but when she ceased the returning
darkness gave him pain as if it had struck
heavily against his breast i dont think
i could she finished in a serious tone

  couldnt you he hesitated per-
plexed it is not a little to ask of you
lie went on very low to make it out as
if you were in a way-anxious though
it need be no pretence things are bad
enough too to make it no shame i tell
you he said rapidly and i am not a
timid man i may not be able to do much
if you people dont help me

 you want me to pretend i am
alarmed she asked quickly

  aye to pretend-as well you may its
a lot to ask of you-who perhaps never
had to make believe a thing-isnt it

  it is she said after a time

  the unexpected bitterness of her tone
struck him with dismay

  dont be offended he entreated ive
got to plan a way out of this mess its
no play either could you

  perhaps if i tried very much but to
what end

  you must all shift aboard the brig
he began speaking quickly and then we
may get over this trouble without coming
to blows now if you were to say that
you wish it that you feel unsafe in the
yacht-dont you see

  i see she pronounced thoughtfully
the brig is small but the cuddy is fit
for a lady went on lingard with anima-
tion

  has it not already sheltered a prin-
cess she commented coolly

  and i shall not intrude

  this is an inducement

  nobody will dare to intrude you
neednt even see me

  this is almost decisive only-

  i know my place

  only i might not have the influence
she finished

  that i can not believe he said
roughly the long and the short of it is

 you dont trust me because you think that
 only people of your own condition speak
 the truth always

 evidently she murmured

 you say to yourself-heres a fellow

 deep in with pirates thieves niggers- 

to be sure-

  a man i never saw the like before 
 went on lingard headlong  such a damn
 ruffian 

 he checked himself full of confusion
 after a time he heard her saying calmly-
 you are like other men in this that you
 get angry when you can not have your
 way at once

 i angry he exclaimed in deadened
 voice you do not understand i am
 thinking of you also-it is hard on
 me-

 i mistrust not you only my own
 power you have produced such an un-
 fortunate impression on mr travers
 unfortunate impression he treated
 me as if i had been a longshore loafer
 never mind that he is your husband
 fear in those you care for is hard to bear

 for any man and so he-

what machiavellism	

 eh what did you say

 i only wondered where you had ob-
 served that on the sea

 observed what he said absently
 then pursuing his idea one word from
 you ought to be enough

 you think so

 i am sure of it why even i my-
 self-

 of course she interrupted but
 dont you think that after parting with
 you on such-such-inimical terms there
 would be a difficulty

 a man like me would do anything for
 money-dont you see

 after a pause she asked-

 and would you care to appear in such
 a light

 as long as you know better

 his voice vibrated-she drew back dis-
 turbed as if unexpectedly he had touched
 her

 what can there be at stake she began
 wonderingly

 a kingdom said lingard

 she leaned far over the rail staring
 he lifted hishead and their faces one
 above the other came very close together
 theres only one other man in these

 seas said lingard who ever thought of
 such a thing and he has done it but
 hes a gentleman with plenty of money
 and powerful friends at home he could
 get a cruiser for the asking and could
 order port captains about like an admiral
 once a whole squadron came along to help
 him he worked for himself well i too
 am an adventurer but theres no one at
 my back no one and i do not work
 for myself not in that way

  not for yourself she whispered

  he felt the touch of her breath on his
forehead and remained still for a moment
perfectly still as if he did not intend to
move or speak any more

  those things he began suddenly
come in your way when you dont think
and they get all round you before you
know what you mean to do when i went
into that bay in new guinea i never
guessed where that course would take me
to i could tell you-would you under-
stand you

  he stammered hesitated and suddenly
spoke liberating the visions of two years
into the night where she could see them as
if outlined in words of fire

his tale was as startling as the dis-
covery of a new world she was
being taken along the boundary of an ex-
citing existence and she looked into it
through the guileless enthusiasm of the
narrator the heroic quality of the feel-
ings concealed what was disproportionate
and absurd in that gratitude in that
friendship in that inexplicable devotion
and left to view only the workings of hu-
man sympathy so vast as to possess the
fascination of a monstrous sentiment the
headlong fierceness of purpose invested his
obscure design of conquest with the pro-
portions of a great enterprise it was clear
that no vision of a subjugated world could
have been more inspiring to the most
famous adventurer of history

  from time to time he interrupted him-
self to ask confidently as if he had been
speaking to an old friend what would
you have done and hurried on without
pausing for approval

  if struck her that there was a disinter-
estedness in all this the beauty of an im-
planted faculty of affection that had found

itself its immediate need of an object and
the way of expansion a tenderness ex-
pressed violently a tenderness that could
only be satisfied by backing human beings
against their own destiny perhaps her
hate of convention trammeling and frank-
ness of her own impulse had rendered her
more alert to perceive what is intrinsically
great and profound within the forms of
human folly so simple and so infinitely
varied according to the region of the earth
and to the moment of time

  he was saying

  i noticed them looking at that land fs
if they were sorry they hadnt been left to
die there i had taken them off and there
was only one thing to do i told myself
i shall bring them back i shall wake up
that country by heavens what else
could you have done

  and as if she had become very simple
and very accessible to the terror the poetry
and the sadness that may be found in
obscure events she seemed to understand
the ardor in the tone the compelling power
in the vision and the mastery of the idea
that enters the brain in the night in a
flash perhaps in a dream and clings to a
life and can be only dislodged by death

  what of it that the narrator was only a
common seaman the kingdom of the jun-
gle the men of the forest the lives ob-
scure that simple soul was possessed
by the greatness of the idea there was
nothing sordid in the flaming impulses
when she once understood that the story
appealed to the audacity of her thoughts
and she became so charmed with what she
heard that she forgot where she was she
forgot that she was personally close to
that tale which she saw detached far away
from her truth or fiction presented in
picturesque speech real only by the re-
sponse of her emotion

  he paused in the cessation of the im-
passioned murmur she began to reflect
with that uncertain hold upon the thought
we have when waking up from a deep
sleep and at first it was only an op-
pressive notion of there being some sig-
nificance that really mattered in this mans
story-that mattered to her for the
first time the shadow of danger and death
crossed her mind was that the meaning
suddenly in a flash of acute discernment
she saw herself involved helplessly in that
story as one is involved in a catastrophe

  he was speaking again he had not
been silent more than a minute it seemed
to her that years had elapsed so different
was the effect of his words her mind
was agitated as if his coming to speak and
confide in her had been a tremendous oc-
currence it was a fact of her own ex-
istence it was part of the story also
that was the disturbing thought she
heard him pronounce several names bel-
arab sheriff daman old wa-ratha
panglima tengga ningart these be-
longed now to her life and she was ap-
palled to find she was unable to connect
these names with any human appearance
they stood out alone as if written on the
night they took on a symbolic shape they
imposed themselves upon her senses she
whispered as if pondering belarab da-
man ningart and these barbarous sounds
seemed to possess an exceptional energy
a fatal aspect the savor of madness

  not one of them but has a heavy score
to settle with the whites whats that to
me i had somehow to get men who would
fight i risked my lifeto get that lot
i made them promises which i shall keep-
or- can you see now why i dared to
stop your boat i am in so deep that i
care for no sir john in the world when
i look at the work ahead i care for noth-
ing i gave you one chance-one good
chance that i had to do no i sup-
pose i didnt look enough of a gentleman
yes yes thats it yet i know what
a gentleman is i lived with them for
years i chummed with them-yes-on
gold-fields and in other places where a man
has got to show the stuff thats in him
some of them write from home to me here
-such as you see me because i-never
mind and i know what a gentleman
could do come wouldnt he treat a
stranger fairly wouldnt he remember
that no man is a liar till you prove him
so wouldnt he keep his word wherever
given well i am going to do that not
a hair of your head shall be touched as
long as i live

  she had regained much of her composure
but at these words she felt that staggering
sense of utter insecurity which is given one
by the first tremor of an earthquake it
was followed by an expectant stillness of
sensations she was silent he thought
she did not believe him

  come what on earth do you think

brought me here-to-to-talk like this to
you i had given one good chance there
was hassim-rajah tulla i should say-
who was asking me this afternoon what
will you do now with these your people
i believe he thinks yet i fetched you here
for some reason you cant tell what
crooked notion they will get into their
thick heads its enough to make one
swear he swore my people are
you how much say-how much
youre no more mine than i am yours
would any of you fine people at home face
black ruin to save a fishing smacks crew
from getting drowned

  notwithstanding that sense of insecurity
which lingered faintly in her mind she had
no image of death before her she felt in-
tensely alive she felt alive in a flush of
strength with an impression of novelty as
if life had been the gift of this very mo-
ment the danger hidden in the night
gave no sign to awaken her terror but the
workings of a human soul simple and
violent were laid bare before her and had
the disturbing charm of an unheard of ex-
perience she was listening to a man who
concealed norhing she said interroga-
tively-

  and yet you have come

  yes he answered for you only

  the flood tide running strong over the
banks made a placid trickling sound about
the yachts rudder

  i would not be saved alone

  then you must bring them over your-
self he said in a somber tone theres
the brig you have me-my men-my
guns you know what to do

   i will try she said

  very well i am sorry for the poor
devils forward there if you fail but of
course you wont watch that light on
the brig i had it hoisted on purpose
the trouble may be nearer than we think
two of my boats are gone scouting among
the islets and if the news they bring is bad
the iight will be lowered youll know
then theres no time to lose in clearing out
from here at night suddenly and with-
out a commanding breeze i may not be
able to interfere in time think what that
means and ive told you what i have told
nobody-think of me also i told you be-
cause i-because i trust you

  he gave a shove against the yachts side
and glided away from under her eyes

  she walked away unsteadily from the 
rail the lamp and the skylights shone
faintly along the dark stretch of the decks
this evening was like the last-like all the
evenings before

  is all this possible she asked herself
no-but it is true

  she sat down in a deck chair to think
and found she could only remember she
was going over her talk with that man
she jumped up she was sure somebody
was hailing the yacht faintly was he
hailing she listened and hearing nothing
was annoyed with herself for being haunted
by a voice

  he said he could trust me now what
is this danger what is danger

  footsteps were coming from forward
the figure of the watchman flitted vaguely
over the gangway he was whistling softly
and vanished hollow sounds in the boat
succeeded a splash of oars the night
swallowed these slight noises she sat
down again and found herself much calmer

  she had the faculty of being able to
think her own thoughts-and the courage
this faculty is odious to men since an in-
dividual thought is the condemnation of
the commonplace the vulgar and the false
as a gift of heaven it is at the same time
the most fortunate and the most cruel in
this exceptional soul the development of
ideas did not dry up the spring of passions
and she could give to an emotion the am-
plitude of a thought however impressed
by lingards warnings she could take no
action of any kind till her husbands re-
turn but lingards warnings were not
what had impressed her most this man
had presented his innermost self unclothed
by any subterfuge there were in plain
sight his desires his perplexities affections
doubts his violence his folly and the
existence they made up was lawless but not
vile

  she had too much elevation of mind to
look upon him from any other but a strictly
human standpoint if he trusted her-
how strange why should he was he
wrong-she accepted the trust with scrupu-
lous fairness and when it dawned upon
her that of all the men in the world this
unquestionably was the one she knew best
she had a moment of amused wonder fol-
lowed by an impression of profound sad-
ness it seemed an unfortunate matter
that concerned her alone

  her thought was suspended while she
listened attentively for the return of the
yachts boat she felt anxious for the
presence of her husband she was dis-
mayed at the task before her not a sound
broke the stillness and she felt as if she
were lost in empty space then suddenly
some one amidships yawned immensely
and said

  oh dear oh dear- a voice asked
aint they back yet

  a grunt answered

  and after all the man was touching be-
cause he could be understood how sim-
ple was life-she reflected she recognized
that this man filled her thoughts she
was frank with herself she considered
him apart from social organization she
discovered he had no place in it how de-
lightful here was a human being and the
naked truth of things was not so very far
from her notwithstanding the growth of
centuries then it occurred to her that
this man by his action stripped her at once
of her position of her wealth of her rank
of her past i am helpless what re-
mains she asked herself nothing
anybody there might have said your
presence she was too artificial yet to
think of her beauty and yet the power of
beauty is part of the naked truth of
things

  she looked over her shoulder and saw
the light at the brigs foreyard-arm burn-
ing with a strong calm flame in the dusk
of starlight suspended above the coast

  she stared intensely into the night as if
she had expected to hear the footsteps to
see the shape to feel the touch of that dan-
ger which words could describe but could
not make clear she heard the heavy bump
as of a boat run heedlessly against the
ladder they were back she rose in
sudden and extreme agitation how could
she tell what should she say how
much how to begin why say any-
thing it would be absurd like talking
seriously about a dream she would not
dare in a moment she was driven into
a state of mind bordering on distraction
she heard somebody dash up the gangway
steps with the idea of gaining time she
walked rapidly aft to the taffrail the
light of the brig faced her without a flicker
enormous amongst the suns scattered in
the immensity of the night

  she fixed her eyes on it she thought

  i shant tell him anything impossible
no i shall tell everything

  she expected every moment to hear her
husbands voice and the suspense was in-
tolerable because she felt that then she
must decide somebody on deck was bab-
bling she devoutly hoped dalcacer
would speak first and thus put off the fatal
moment a voice said roughly-

  whats that

  and in the midst of her distress she rec-
ognized carters voice having noticed that
young man who was of a different stamp
from the rest of the crew she came to the
conclusion that the matter could be related
jocularly or-why not pretend fear at
that moment the brigs yardarm-light she
was looking at trembled distinctly and she
was dumfounded as if she had seen a com-
motion in the firmament with her lips
open for a cry she saw it fall straight down
several feet flicker and go out all the
perplexity passed from her mind this
first fact of the danger gave her a thrill
of quite a new emotion something had
to be done at once for some remote rea-
son she felt ashamed of herself

  she moved swiftly forward and under
the lamp came face to face with carter
who was coming aft both stopped star-
ing the light fell on their faces and both
were struck by each others expression
the four eyes shone wide

  you have seen she asked beginning
to tremble

  how do you know he said at the
same time evidently surprized

  suddenly she saw that everybody was on
deck

  the light is out she stammered

  the gentlemen are lost said carter
then he perceived she did not seem to
understand kidnaped off the sand-
bank he continued looking at her fixedly
to-see how she would take it she seemed
calm kidnaped like a pair of lambs
not a squeak he burst out with indigna-
tion but the sandbank is long and they
mighj have been at the other end you
were on deck maam he asked

  yes she murmured in the chair
here

  we were all down below i had to rest
a little when i came up the watchman
was asleep he swears he wasnt but i
know better nobody heard anything un-
less you did but perhaps you were sleep-

ing in the chair he asked deferentially

  yes-no-i must have been she said
faintly

lingards soul was exalted by his
talk with edith by the strain of in-
certitude and by extreme fatigue on
coming aboard he asked after hassim and
was told that the rajah and his sister had
gone off in their canoe promising to return
before midnight  the boats sent to ex-
amine the channels between the islets north
and south of the anchorage had not come
back yet he went into his cabin and
throwing himself on the couch closed his
eyes thinking-i mtlst sleep or i shall go
mad the thought that all his future
depended upon the action of the man whom
he defined as a stuck-up fool gave him
the sensation of something red-hot in his
head

  will she manage it if she doesnt im
ruined

  at times he felt an unshaken confidence
in her-then he remembered her face
next moment the face would fade he
would make an effort to hold on to the
image fail-and then become convinced
without the shadow of a doubt that he was
utterly lost unless he let all these people
be wiped off the face of the earth

  they all heard him order me out of
his ship- he thought and thereupon for
a second or so he contemplated without
flinching the lurid image of a massacre
and yet i told her not a hair of her head
shall be touched not a hair

  and irrationally at the recollection of
these words there seemed to be no trouble
of any kind left in the world now and
then however there were black instants
when from sheer weariness he thought of
nothing at all and during one of these
he fell asleep losing the consciousness
of external things as suddenly as if he had
been felled by a blow on the head

  when he sat up almost before he was
properly awake his first alarmed convic-
tion was that he had slept the night
through there was a light in the cuddy
and through the open door of his cabin
he saw distinctly the woman with whom
he had been talking pass out of vieto across
the lighted space

they did come on board after all-

he thought- how is it i havent been
called

  he leaped out and darted into the cuddy
nobody he listened for footsteps on the
stairs or on the deck above nothing
looking up at the clock in the skylight he
was vexed to see it had stopped till at last
his ear caught the faint beat of the mecha-
nism it was going then he could not
have been asleep more than ten minutes
he had not been on board more than
twenty

  so it was only a deception he had seen
no one and yet he remembered the turn
of the head the line of the neck the color
of the hair the movement of the passing
figure he returned spiritlessly to his state-
room muttering-no more sleep for me
tonight and came out directly holding a
few sheets of paper closely covered with a
high angular hand-writing

  this was jorgensons letter written three
days before and entrusted to hassim he
had read it already twice in the afternoon
but he turned up the lamp a little higher
and sat down to read it again above his
head the barrels of the muskets glinted in
a level row and at his back the rudder-
casing encircled by bayonets resembled
a squat column of steel with a wrought
band of-brass for capital on the red shield
the gilt sheaf of thunderbolts darting be-
tween the initials of his name seemed to
be aimed straight at the nape of his neck
as he sat with bared elbows spread on the
table pouring over the crumpled sheets

  the letter began

  hassim and immada are going out tonight to
look for you you are behind your time as it
is and every passing day makes things worse
i write this not knowing if i shall be alive
when you turn up nobody is after me yet
and i have been in tighter places but then i
had only my own conscience to reckon with
now it is yours i dont know you tom lin-
gard if you dont make a lot of trouble for your-
self out of this affair out of all the lot of
traders that rushed these seas of late you are
the only man something after my mind but you
mean so well about so many things that a hellish
mess is all i expect i went in for more des-
perate jobs than any you can find to do now-a-
days and all the time i meant well only to my-
self i am smashed up but i stuck to it and
after these years i may say not one of the men
i helped has a right to curse me will you be
able to say the same by-and-by

  here the first loose page ended lin-
gard looked at it for some time with a

troubled face then laid it aside and went
on reading

  ten days ago three of belarabs men who
bad been collecting turtles eggs on the islets
came flying back with a story of a ship stranded
on the outer mudflats belarab at once forbade
any boats from leaving the lagoon so far good
there were many surmises as to the character
of the vessel and a great excitement in the
village the general talk is of a ship-of-war i
judged it must be a schooner-probably some
fool of a trader however you will know all
about her when you read this you may say i
might have pulled out tq sea to have a look by
myself but beside belarabs orders to the con-
trary which i would attend to for the sake of ex-
ample all you are worth in this world tom is
here in the emma under my feet and i would
not leave my charge even for half a day

  hassim attended the council held every
evening in the shed outside belarabs stockade
holy old ningart was for looting that vessel
hassim reproved him saying that the vessel
probably was sent by you because no white
men were known to come inside the shoals
belarab backed hassim ningart was very angry
and reproached belarab for keeping him nin-
gart short of opium to smoke he began by
calling him  son and ended by shouting 
you worse than an unbeliever two of belarabs
men drew krisses there was a hullabaloo the
followers of tengga were ready to interfere and
you know how it is between tengga and belarab
datu tengga always wanted to oust belarab
and his chances wero getting pretty good before
you showed up and armed belarabs bodyguard
with muskets hassim  stopped the row and
no one was hurt that time but next day which
was friday ningart after reading the prayers in
the mosque talked to the people outside

  he bleated and capered like an old goat
prophesying misfortune ruin and extermination
if these whites were allowed to get away he
is mad but then they think him a saint and
he had been fighting the dutch for years in his
young days six of belarabs men marched
down the village street carrying muskets at full
cock and the crowd cleared out ningart was
taken away by tenggas men into their masters
stockade hes pretty near as strong as belarab
and if it was not for the fear of you turning
up soon there would have been a fight that
evening i think it is a pity tengga is not chief
of the land instead of belarab a brave and
foresighted man however treacherous or violent
can always be trusted to a certain extent i
can never get anything clear from belarab he
is crafty but muddle-headed i think unless
hes too deep for me maybe he would like to
see tengga go for that wretched ship because
he would have a good chance while tengga is
busy outside to get into his stockade then he
could make what terms he liked with the datu
but he wont let any of the village people have
a finger in a looting job peace peace you
know his fad and this fad makes him act
 the peace racket will get him into a row
it will cost him his life yet many of the old
villagers would follow tengga

   walking ashore the other night i saw that
 old sura-the old carver of handles and sheathes
 -cleaning a rusty flintlock what news i
 asked the news is good o tuan says he
 please god we will fight a little and get a
 little loot too mayhap as men should there
 are many more like that old fellow i pointed
 out to belarab how risky it would be if his peo-
 ple interfered with the whites he sees that
 but at the same time he is anxious for tengga
 to do something rash which would give him
 belarab the upper hand meantime tengga
 does not feel himself strong enough to act with
 his own followers only and belarab has on my
 advice disarmed the villagers his men went
 into the houses and took away by force all the
 firearms and as many spears as they could lay
 hands on the women screamed abuse of course
 but there was no resistance a few men were
 seen clearing out into the forest with their arms
 note this for it means there is another power
 besides belarabs in the village clearly tengga

   one morning-four days ago-i went to see
 tengga i found him by the shore trimming a
 plank with a small hatchet while a slave held
 an umbrella over his head he is amusing him-
 self in building a boat just now he threw his
 hatchet down to meet me and led me by the
 hand to a shady spot several men with swords
 shield and lance lounged about he told me
 frankly he had sent out two good swimmers to
 observe the stranded vessel these men stole
 down the crcek in a canoe and when on the sea-
 coast swam from sandbank to sandbank until
 they approached unobserved-i think-to about
 fifty yards from that schooner what is that
 craft i cant make it out the men report
 there are three chiefs on board one whose
 eye glitters one a lean man in white and theres
 another without iny hair on the face and
 dressed differently to the others could it be a
 woman i dont know what to think i wish
 - you were here

   after a lot of chatter tengga said six years
 ago i was ruler of a country and the dutch
 drove me out the country was small but
 nothing is too small for them to take they
 pretended to give it back to my nephew-may
 he bum i ran away or they would have killed
 me i am nothing here-but i remember these
 people out there can not run away and they
 are very few there is perhaps a little to take
 i would give it to my men who followed me
 in my calamity because i am their chief and my
 father was the chief of their fathers i pointed
 out the imprudence of this he said-the dead
 do not show the way to this i remarked that
 the ignorant do not give information he kept
 quiet for a while then with grave bitterness
 said we must not touch them because their
 skin is like yours and to kill them would be
 wrong but at the bidding of you whites we
 may go and fight with people of our skin and
 our own faith-and that is good i have
 promised to tuan lingard twenty men and a
 prau to make war in wajo the men are good
 and look at the prau it is swift and strong
 i must say tom the prau is the best craft of the
 kind i have ever seen i said you paid him for
 the help and i also would pay says he if
 you let me have a few guns and a little powder

si

by joseph conrad
 for my men we shall share the loot of that
 ship outside only you and i and tuan lingard
 will not know it is only a little game you
 have plenty of guns and powder under your
 care he meant in the emma

    on that i spoke out pretty straight and we
 got rather warm until at last he gave me to
 understand that as he had about forty men of
 his own and i had only nine of hassims chaps
 to defend the emma with he could very well
 go for me and get the lot and then says he
 i would be so strong that everybody would be
 on my side i discovered in the course of
 further talk that there is a notion amongst many
 people that you have come to grief in some way
 and wont show up again-in fact that the
 great queen had ordered the tran besar the
 great lord in singapore to imprison and fine you
 it being improper-as tcngga said-for a com-
 mon nathoda like you to be so rich and power-
 ful after this i saw the position was serious
 and i was in a hurry to get to the emnta but
 pretending i did not care i said you were a
 friend to the great lord in singapore at which
 he smiled then i smiled too and thanked him
 for giving me warning of his intentions about
 me and the emma at this he nearly choked
 himself with his betel quid and fixing me with
 his little eyes muttered-even a lizard will give
 a fly the time to say its prayers i turned my
 back on him and was very thankful to get be-
 yond the throw of a spear i havent been out
 of the emma since hassim and immada left
 belarab and came to live on board that same
 day but hassim goes ashore every day to watch
 whats going on

ix

 the letter went on to describe with
 careful minuteness the intrigues of
 tengga the wavering conduct of belarab
 and the state of the public mind it noted
 every gust of opinion and every event with
 an earnestness of belief in their importance
 befitting the chronicle of a crisis in the his-
 tory of an empire the shade of jorgen-
 son had indeed stepped back into the life
 of men it looked at passions miserable
 and poignant the love of loot and the love
 of danger at the strength of hereditary
 instincts and at the stir of slumbering de-
 sire the old adventurer did not express
 any opinion on what he saw he simply
 looked on with a perfect understanding of
 the value of trifles using his eyes for that
 other man whose conscience would have the
 task to unravel the tangle lingard had
 his need to know as exactly satisfied as
 if he had seen he could picture to him-
 self the faces the gestures he could al-
 most imagine the very inflections of voices
 and detect the fundamental significance
 of tones and glances he lived through

the r

those days in the settlement and was thank-
ful to jorgenson only as he lived not from
day to day but from sentence to sentence
of the writing there was an effect of be-
wildering rapidity in the succession of
events that inade him grunt with surprize
sometimes or growl-what to himself
angrily and turn back several lines or a
whole page more than once toward the
end he had a heavy frown of perplexity and
fidgeted as he read

  -and i began to think i could keep things
quiet till you came or those wretched people got
their schooner off when sherif daman arrived
from the north on the very day he was ex-
pected with two illanun praus i did not expgt
to see such a soft-spoken man he looks like
a hindu it is very evident to me he can wind
the two illanun pangerans round his little finger
the two praus are large and armed with one
long gun and several four-pounder pieces they
sneaked all down the bruni coast without being
seen by a single cruiser and made for the south
entrance where belarab had planted a beacon
so that they did not pass anywhere near the
stranded schooner though they did see her of
course they came up the creek flags and
streamers flying beating drums and gongs and
entered the lagoon with their decks full of armed
men brandishing two-handed swords and sound-
ing the war cry a fine sight  they have
women and children with them as is their
custom anil i must say they do look as if they
would neither give nor expect quarter in war
it is a fine force for you only belarab who is a
perverse devil would not receive sherif daman
at once so daman went to see tengga who
kept him a very longr time leaving tcngga he
came on board the emma and i could sec
directly there was something up

  he began by asking me for the ammunition
and weapons they arc to get from you saying
he was anxious to sail at once toward wajo
since it was agreed he was to precede you by a
few days i replied that that was true enough
but that i could not think of giving him the
powder and muskets till you came he began
to talk about you and hinted that perhaps you
will never come and no matter says he
here is rajah hassim and the lady immada
and we would fight for them if no white man
was left in the world only we must have
something to fight with he pretended then
to forget me altogether and talked with hassim
while i sat listening he began to boast how
well he got alone the bruni coast no illanun
prau had passed down that coast for years i
broke in remarking that all the english men-
of-war were up onthe coast of china where
there was war going he turned sharp at me
and says-the white men will kill many china-
men i said  expect so how many he asks
many hundreds or maybe several thousands

i said yes several thousands no doubt then
looking thoughtfully all over the lagoon he
says ten years ago the whites hanged my
father and two brothers for killing only eight

scue
          - romance

chinamen-only eight wretched chinamen i
was so taken aback i could not say a word
jt came to my recollection that mans family
must have been chiefs of tampassuk which was
taken and burnt by the fleet many years ago
on account of the piratical habits of the people
there was some hanging done too no doubt
about it this is bad this man must have
been very young at the time but he seems to
have been brooding over it-and that is dangerous
in a native

  i said at last with dont-carc-a-damn air
that white men were not so easy to kill as
chinamen- no says he and sighed immada
wanted me to give the arms he was asking for
the girl is beside herself with fear of some-
thing happening that would put a stopper on
the wajo expedition she has set her mind on
getting her country back hassim is very re-
served but he is very anxious too daman
got nothing from me and that very evening
the praus were ordered by belb to leave the
lagoon he does not trust the illanuns and
small blame to him sheriff daman went he
has no powder for his guns as the praus
passed by the emma he shouted to me he was
going to wait for you in a creek ten miles south
from here tengga has given him a man who
would show him the place all this looks very
queer to me

  i did think for a moment of sending word
to these white peopla to clear out-anyhow-in
their boats if they cant get the schooner off
but after all i darent give your whole show
away besides would they have believed me

i	dont know who these whites are not traders
-i am certain

  look out outside then the trails are hiding
in that creek or else dodging amongst the islets
daman has been up here twice in a war canoe
belonging to one of the praus he visits tengga
tengga called on me as a good friend to try and
persuade me to give daman the arms and gun-
powder he is so anxious to get somehow or
other they tried to get around belarab who
came to see me last night and hinted i had better
do so he is anxious for these illanuns to leave
the neighborhood he thinks that if they can
loot the schooner they will be off at once thats
all he wants now immada has been to see
belarabs women and stopped two nights in the
stockade belarabs youngest wife-he got mar
ried six weeks ago-is on the side of tenggas
party because she thinks the chief would get a
share of the loot and she got into her silly head
there are jewels and silks in that schooner what
between tengga worrying him outside and the
women worrying him at home belarab had
such a lively time of it that he concluded to go to
pray at his fathers tomb so for the last two
days he has been away camping in that un-
healthy place when he comes back he will
have fever as sure as fate and then he will be
no good for anything tengga lit up asmoky
fire this morning some signal to daman i
went ashore with hassims men and put it out
tins was risking a fight-for tenggas men
looked very black at me i dont know what
the next move may be hassims as true as
steel immada is very unhappy they will tell
you many details i had no time to write

  the last page fluttered on the table out
 of lingards fingers he sat very still for
 a moment looking straight before him then
 went on deck

   our boats back yet he asked shaw
 whom he saw prowling on the quarter-deck

   no sir i wish they were i am wait-
 ing for them to go and turn in answered
 the mate in an aggrieved manner

    lower that light there cried lingard
 suddenly in malay

    this trade isnt fit for a decent man
 muttered shaw to himself and he moved
 away to lean on the rail looking moodily
 to seaward after a while there seems
 to be commotion on board that yacht
 he said i see a lot of lights moving about
 aft anything wrong do you think sir

   no i know what it is said lingard
 in a tone of elation

    she has done it he thought

    he returned to the cabin put away jor-
 gensons letter and pulled out the drawer
 of the table it was full of cartridges
 he took a musket down loaded it then
 took another and another he bit the
 cartridges hammered at the waddings with
 fierce joyousness with something impa-
 tient in his movements the ramrods rang
 and jumped the table was covered with
 loaded mufekets it seemed to him he was
 doing his share of some work in which
 that woman was playing her part faith-
 fully

    she has done it he repeated mentally
 she has done it and why she does not
 understand anything of danger it looks
 as if she had done it for me imagine her
 in that cabin and with his teeth fastened
 in a cartridge he stood looking across the
 table at the settee as if she had been
 sitting tlre before his eyes i could
 talk to her just as if i had known her from
 a child he muttered flinging a ram-
 rod down the barrel violently

   the intimacy of his thought with that
 woman seemed to affect his body like
 strong drink so that while cocking a
 musket he swayed a little his hand trem-
 bled when he picked up a little copper-
 cap that shone like a tiny red spark be-
 tween his big fingers he pressed it stead-
 ily on the nipple and his face was very
 still they would be here directly she
 would be on board here

   all her doing no friend could have
 served me better he smiled with a dazed

 air at the loaded firearms at the red
 shield all around at the white and gold
 paneling of the cuddy shes like those
 women you read about she took my
 breath away the first time i looked at her

   she walks like a clipper swims you
would think there could be no such eyes
when you look at them you could fancy
yourself away up sitting on a royal truck
my word-you want a steady head-a
steady head- leaning with both hands
on the table he lost himself completely-
i would never have had the pluck to
speak to her if my blood hadnt been up
on account of that fool her husband
a whiskered little skunk-i could shake
his little soul out-

   he shook at arms length his clenched
 hand as if he had somebody by the throat
 he was placated by the recollection that
 she was coming on board

   she will sit in the cuddy she will
sleep in my berth well im not ashamed
of the brig by heavens-no i shall
keep away never come near them as ive
promised now theres nothing more to
say ive told her everything at once
theres nothing more

  he felt a heaviness in his burning
breast in all his limbs as if the blood
in his veins had become molten lead

   i shall get the yacht off three four
 days-no a week

   he found he couldnt do it under a week
 it occurred to him he would see her every
 day till the yacht was afloat no he
 wouldnt intrude but he was master and
 owner of the brig after all he didnt
 mean to skulk like a whipped cur about his
 own decks

   itll be ten days before the schooner
 is ready ill take every scrap of ballast
 out of her ill strip her-ill take her
 lower masts out of her by heavens ill
 make sure then another week to fit out
 -and-good-by wish i had never seen
 them good-by-forever homes the
 place for them not for me on another
 coast she would not have listened ah
 but she is a woman-every inch of her
 i shall shake hands yes i shall take
 her hand-if i have to kill a man for it
 yes-just before she goes why the devil
 not i am master here after all-in this
 brig-as good as any one-by heavens
 better than any one-better than any one
 on earth



nru 

  he heard shaw walk smartly forward
above his head hailing-

  whats that-a boat

  a voice answered indistinctly

  one of my boats is back thought lin-
gard news about daman perhaps i
dont care if he kicks i wish he would
i would soon show her i can fight as well
as i can handle the brig two praus
only two praus i wouldnt mind if there
were twenty i would sweep em off the
sea-i would blow em out of the water-
i would make the brig walk over them
now id say to her you who are not
afraid now look how its done this would
be danger for any other man look  

  he felt light he had the sensation of
being whirled high in the midst of an up-
roar and as powerless as a feather in a
hurricane he shuddered profoundly and
leaned the musket gently against the edge
of the table

  no fighting he murmured his face
became drawn his eyes had a careworn
look what am i thinking of there
must be no fighting i went to her-she
is coming-for that

  his arms hung down and he stood be-
fore the table staring like a man overcome
by some fatal intelligence

  shaw going into the waist to receive
what he thought was one of the brigs
boats came against carter making his
way aft hurriedly

  hullo is it you again he said
swiftly barring the way

  i come from the yacht began carter
with some impatience

  where else could you come from
said shaw and what might you want
i want to see your skipper

  well you cant declared shaw vic-
iously hes turned in for the night
call him up he expects me said car-
ter stamping his foot ive got to tell him
what happened

  dont you fret yourself young man
said shaw in a superior manner he knows
all about it

  they stood suddenly silent in the dark
carter seemed at a loss what to do shaw
though surprized by it enjoyed the effect
he had produced

damn me if i did not think so mur-
mured carter to himself then drawling
coolly asked-and perhaps you know
what do you think think i am a

the rescue
romance

dummy here i aint mate of this brig
for nothing

  no you are not said carter with a
certain bitterness of tone people do all
kinds of queer things for a living and i
am not particular myself but i should
think twice before taking your billet
what what do you in-si-un-ate my
billet you aint fit for it you yacht-
swabbing brass-buttoned imposter
whats this any of our boats back
asked lingard from the poop let the
specanie in charge come to me at once
theres only a message from the yacht
began shaw deliberately

  yacht get the deck lamps along here
in the waist see the ladder lowered bear
a hand serang mr shaw burn the
flare-up aft two of hem give light
to the boats that will be coming alongside
steward wheres that steward turn
him out then

  bare feet began to patter all round
carter shadows glided swiftly

  are these flares coming wheres the
quartermaster on duty shouted lingard
in english and malay this way come
here mara sini damn you put it on
a rocket stick-cant you hold over the
side-thus stand by with the lines for
the boats forward there mr shaw-we
want light

  aye aye sir called out shaw but
he did not move as if dazed by the vehe-
mence of his commander

  thats what we want muttered carter
under his breath imposter what do
you call yourself he said half aloud to
shaw

  the ruddy glare of the flares disclosed
lingard from head to foot standing at
the break of the poop his head was
bare his face crudely lighted had a
fierce and changing expression in the
sway of flames

  what can be his game thought
carter impressed by the powerful and
wild aspect of that figure he seems to
iee something hes changed somehow
since i saw him first he reflected

  it struck him the change was serious
not exactly for the worse perhaps-and
yet   by the lord harry he looks a
little mad lingard smiled at him from
the poop

  carter went up the steps and without

pausing informed him of what had hap-
pened

  mrs travers told me to go to you at
once shes very upset as you may guess
he drawled looking lingard hard in the
face lingard knitted his eyebrows
the hands too are scared carter went
on they fancy the savages or whatever
they may be who stole the owner are go-
ing to board the yacht every minute i

dont think so myself but-

  quite right-most unlikely muttered
lingard

  aye i dare say you know all about
it continued carter coolly the men are
startled and no mistake but i cant blame
them very much there isnt enough even
of carving knives aboard to go round one
old signal gun a poor show for better
men than they

  theres no mistake i suppose about
this affair asked lingard

  well unless the gentlemen are having
a lark with us at hide and seek the man
says he wasted ten minutes at the point
then pulled slowly along the bank looking
out expecting to see them walking back
he made the trunk of a tree apparently
stranded on the sand and as he was scull-
ing past he says a man jumped up from
behind that log flung a stick at him and
went off running he backed water at
once and began to shout are you there
sir no one answered he could hear
the bushes rustle and some strange noises
like whisperings it was very dark after
calling out several times and waiting on
his oars he got frightened and pulled back
to the yacht that is clear enough the
only doubt in my mind is if they are alive
or not i didnt let on to mrs travers
thats a kind of thing you keep to your-
self of course i

  i dont think they are dead said
lingard slowly and as if thinking of some-
thing else

  oh if you say so its all right said
carter with deliberation

  what asked lingard absently
fling a stick did they fling a spear
thats it assented carter but i
didnt say anything i only wondered if
the same kind of stick hadnt been flung
at the owner thats all but i suppose
you know your own business best
captain

  lingard grasping his whole beard re-

fleeted profoundly erect and with bowed
head in the glare of the flares

  i suppose you think its my doing
he asked sharply without looking up

  carter surveyed him with a candidly
curious gaze

  well captain mrs travers did let on
a bit to me about our chief-ofticers boat
youve stopped it havent you how she
got to know god only knows she was
sorry she spoke too but it wasnt so
much of a news to me as she thought i
can put two and two together sometimes
these rockets last night eh i wished i
had bitten my tongue out before i told
you about our first gig but i was taken
unawares wasnt i i put it to you
wasnt i and so i told her when she
asked me what passed between you and
me on board this brig not twenty-four
hours ago things look different now
all of a sudden enough to scare a woman
but she is the best man of them all on
board the others are fairly off  the
chump because its a bit dark and some-
thing has happened they aint used to
but she has something on her mind i
cant make her out he paused wriggled
his shoulders slightly-no more than i
can make you out he added

   thats your trouble is it said lingard

  aye captain is it all clear to you
stopping boats kidnaping gentlemen
thats fun in a way only-i am a young-
ster to you-but is it all clear to you
old robinson wasnt particular you know
and he-

  clearer than daylight cried lingard
hotly i cant give up-

  he checked himself carter waited the
flare-bearers stood rigid turning their
faces away from the flame and in the
play of gleams at its foot the mast near-by
like a lofty column ascended in the great
darkness a lot of ropes ran upsanling
into a dark void and were lost to sight
but high aloft a brace block gleamed
white the end of a yardarm could be
seen suspended in the air and as if glow-
ing with its own light the sky had
clouded over the brig without a breath of
wind

  give up repeated carter with an un-
easy shuffle of feet

  nobody finished lingard i cant
its as clear as daylight i cant no
nothing

  he stared straight out afar and after
looking at him carter felt moved by a bit
of youthful intuition to murmur thats
bad in a tone that almost in spite of
himself hinted at the dawning of a be-
fogged compassion he did not believe
there was any daylight to be seen aye
not even by the man who stood there
looking strong enough to knock down a
wall was it compassion he felt it
must have been since in that misty feel-
ing that came to him he associated the
man before his eyes with the perplexed
the resolute the hesitating the assured
the bewildered figure of the woman who
had sent him in hot haste on board the brig
with a message of trust spoken with an
air of mingled confidence and preoccu-
pation as if -her mind had been following
while she spoke some other meaning of the
same plain words an inward meaning
leading her away from the simple neces-
sities of the case

  he had a sense of confusion within him
the sense of mystery without he had
never experienced anything like it all the
time when serving with old robinson in
the ly-c-moon and yet he had seen and
taken part in some queer doings that were
not clear to him at the time they were
secret but they suggested something com-
prehensible this affair did not it had
somehow a subtlety that affected him he
was uneasy as if there had been a breath
of magic of events and men giving to this
complicatioa of a yachting voyage a sig-
nificance impossible to perceive but felt in
the words in the gestures in the events
which made them all strangely startling

  he was not one who could keep track
of his sensations and besides he had not
theleisure he had to answer lingards
questions about the people of the yacht
no he couldnt say mrs travers was
what you may call frightened she seemed
to have something in her mind oh yes
the chaps were in a funk would they
fight anybody would fight when driven
to it funk or no funk that was his
experience naturally one liked to have
something better than a handspike to do it
with still--

  in the pause carter seemed to weigh
with composure the chances of men with
handspikes

  what do you want to fight them for
he asked suddenly



the rescue
romance -

  lingard started

  i dont he said i wouldnt be asking
you

  theres no saying what you would do
captain replied carter it isnt twenty-
four hours since you wanted to shoot me

i havent fongotten that

  i only said i would rather than let
you go raising trouble for me explained
lingard

  one night isnt like another mumbled
carter but how am i to know it seems
to me you are making trouble for your-
self as fast as you can

  well supposing i am said lingard
with a sudden gloominess would your
men fight if i armed them properly

  what-for you or for themselves
asked carter

  for the woman damn it burst out
lingard you forget theres a woman on
board vi dont care that for their car-
cases

  carter pondered conscientiously

  not tonight he said at last theres
one or two good men amongst them but
the rest are struck all of a heap not to-
night give them time to get steady a bit
if you want them to fight

  he gave facts and opinions with a mix- 
ture of loyalty and mistrust his own
state puzzled him exceedingly he
couldnt make out anything he did not
know what to believe and yet he had an
impulsiye desire an inspired desire to help
the man at times it appeared a neces-
sity-at others policy-between whiles a
great folly which perhaps did not matter
because he suspected himself of being
helpless anyway then he had moments
of anger in those moments he would
feel in his pocket the butt of a loaded
pistol he had provided himself with the
weapon which hung on a rail in the sailing-
masters cabin when directed by mrs
travers to go on board the brig

  if he wants to interfere with me ill
let drive at him and take my chance of
getting away he had explained hur-
riedly

  he remembered how startled mrs
travers looked of course a woman like
that-not used to hear such talk there-
fore it was no use listening to her except
for manners sake once bit twice shy
he had no mind to be kidnaped not he
nor bullied either

  i cant let him nab me loo you will
want me now mrs travers he had said
and i promise you not to lire off the old
thing unless he jolly well forces me to

  he was youthfully wise in his resolu-
tion not to give way to her entreaties
though her extraordinary agitation did
stagger him for a moment it was part
of that inexplicable quality pervading the
events of the last twenty-four hours she
seemed more scared than when she heard
first of her husbands disappearance not
mean to kill him it was just when he
meant if it came to it but women dont
look in the same way at these things
when the boat was already on its way to
the brig he remembered her calling out
after him

  you must not you dont under-
stand

  her voice coming faintly in the dark-
ness moved him it resembled so much a
cry of distress

  give way boys give way he urged
his men

  he was wise resolute and he was also
youthful enough to almost wish it should
come to it and with foresight he even
instructed the boats crew to keep the gig
just abaft the main rigging of the brig

  when you see me drop into her all
of a sudden shove off and pull for dear
life

  somehow just then he was not so
anxious for a shot but he held on with a
determined mental grasp to his fine reso-
lution lest it should slip away from him
and perish in a sea of doubts

  hadnt i better get back to the
yacht he asked gently getting no
answer he went on with deliberation
mrs travers ordered me to say that
no matter how this came about she is
ready to trust you she is waiting for
some kind of answer i suppose

  ready to trust me repeated lin-
gard

  his eyes lit up with pleasure he looked
about proudly-then sighed shes not
the only one to trust me he said fasten-
ing his eyes upon carter who managed
to appear perfectly unconcerned

  every sway of flares tossed slightly to
and fro the massy shadows of the main
deck where here and there the figure of a
man could be seen standing very still with
a dusky face and glittering eyeballs

  carter stole his hand warily into his-
breast pocket-

  well captain he said

  he was not going to be bullied let the
owners wife trust whom she liked

  have you got anything in writing for
me there asked lingard advancing a
pace

  carter alert stepped back to keep his
distance shaw who had listened disre-
garded stared from the side his rub-
icund checks quivered his round eyes
seemed starting out of his head and his
mouth was open as if he had been ready
to choke with pent up curiosity amaze-
ment and indignation

  no not in writing said carter
steadily and low

  lingard had the air of being awakened
by a shout the troubled gaze the con-
templative expression of one who while
speaking to men communes with a vision
vanished from his face a heavy and
darkening frown seemed to fall out of the
night upon his forehead and swiftly passed
into the night again and when it departed
it left his visage so calm his glance so
lucid his mien so composed that it was
difficult to believe the mans heart had
undergone within the last second the trial
of humiliation and of danger he smiled
sadly

  well young man he asked with a
kind of good-humored resignation what
is it you have there a knife or a pistol

  a pistol said carter are you sur-
prized captain he spoke with heat be-
cause a sense of regret was stealing slowly
within him as stealthily as irresistibly as
the flowing tide i wasnt going to be
taken unaware if you had the fancy to talk
again about shooting who began these
tricks he withdrew his hand empty
and raised his voice you are up to some-
thing i cant make out you-you are
not straight

  the flares held on high streamed right
up without swaying and in that instant of
profound calm the shadows on the brigs
deck became as still as the men

  you think i am not said lingard
thoughtfully

  carter nodded he resented the turn
of the incident and the growing impulse
to surrender to that man

  i didnt think i could be such a fool
he thought

   mrs travers trusts me though said
lingard with gentle triumph as if advanc-
ing an unanswerable argument of defence

  so she says grunted carter i
warned her shes a baby theyre all
as innocent as babies there and you
know it and i know it ive heard of
your kind you would dump the lot of us
overboard if it served your turn thats
what i believe

   and thats all

   carter nodded slightly and looked away
there was a silence lingards eyes trav-
eled over the brig the lighted part of
the vessel appeared in bright and wavering
detail walled and canopied by the night
he felt a light breath on his face the
air was stirring but the shallows silent and
lost in the darkness gave no sound of life

  this stillness oppressed lingard the
world of his endeavors and his hopes
seemed dead seemed gone his desire
existed homeless in the obscurity that had
devoured his corner of the sea this stretch
of the coast his certitude of success and
here in the midst of what was the domain
of his adventurous soul there was a lost
youngster ready to shoot him on suspicion
of some extravagant treachery came
ready to shoot thats good too he
was too weary to laugh-and also too sad

  the episode separated him violently
from the kinship with his race it found
him out it was like an answer to what
lurked within him as destruction may lurk
in a spark-to the fiercely intended dis-
regard of the lives whose value he had to
measure against the priceless stuff of a
dream the outrage was in the implied
claim on his allegiance he had none of it
for the beings who passing suddenly from
their world into his were to his eyes ac-
customed to other contemplations more
unsubstantial than so many specters

   also the danger of the pistol-shot which
he believed real-the young are rash-irri-
tated him he thought that the work of
saving the reality of two years of hard toil
of struggle of affection of belief of life in
a word was hard enough without being
complicated by an uneasiness as to safety
of the bare existence the night and the
spot were full of contradictions he was
humiliated by the distrust of which he
was the object but it was also like a tribute
to the enigma that lived with him to the
young man before him he turned with



the rescue
romance

anger and sympathy it was impossible
to say who in this shadowy warfare was
to be an enemy and who were the allies
so close were the contacts issuing from
this complication of a yachting voyage that
he seemed to have them all within his
breast

  shoot me he is quite up to that trick
-hang him yet i would trust him sooner
than any man in that yacht

  such were his thoughts while he looked
at carter who was biting his lips in the
vexation of the long silence when they
spoke again to each other no allusion was
made to what had taken place they
talked soberly with a sense of relief feel-
ing as if they had come into cool air from
an overheated room and when carter dis-
missed went into his boat he had prac-
tically agreed to the line of action traced
by lingard for the crew of the yacht he
had agreed as if in implicit confidence it
was one of the absurdities of the situation
which had to be accepted and could never
be understood

  do i talk straight now asked lin-
gard

  it looks straight enough assented
carter with an air of reserve i will work
with you so far anyhow

  mrs travers trusts me remarked
lingard

  by the lord harry cried carter giv-
ing way suddenly to some latent convic-
tion i was warning her against you and
she argued with me as if she had known
you from a child say captain you are
a devil of a man how did you manage
it

  i trusted her said lingard

  did you cried the amazed carter
when how how-

  you will know no more you know
too much already said lingard quietly
waste no time i will be after you

  carter whistled low

  theres a pair of you i cant make out
he called back hurrying over the side

  shaw took this opportunity to approach
beginning with hesitation a word with
you sir the mate went on to say he
was a respectable man he delivered
himself in a ringing unsteady voice he
was married he had children he abhorred
illegality the light played about his
obese figure he had flung his mushroom
hat on the deck he was not afraid to speak

the truth the gray mustache stood out
aggressively his glances were uneasy he
pressed his hands to his stomach con-
vulsively opened his thick short arms
wide wished it to be understood he had
been chief-officer of home ships with a
spotless character and he hoped quite up
to his work he was a peaceable man
none more disposed to stretch a point
when it came to a difference with niggers
of some kind they had to be taught
manners and reason and he was not
averse at a pinch to-but here were white
people-gentlemen ladies not to speak of
the crew

  he liberated all that was on the bottom
of his nature he had never spoken to a
superior like this before and this was
prudence his conviction a point of view
a point of principle a conscious superiority
and a burst of resentment hoarded through
years against all the successive and unsatis-
factory captains of his existence

  there never had been such an oppor-
tunity to show he could not be put upon
he had one of them on a string and he
was going to lead him a dance there was
a courage too in it since he believed him-
self fallen unawares into the clutches of a
particularly desperate man and beyond the
reach of law

  a certain small amount of calculation
entered the audacity of his remonstrance
perhaps-it flashed upon him-the gentry
hear i stood up for them this could
conceivably be of advantage to a man who
wanted a lift in the world owner of a
yacht - badly scared - a gentleman -
money nothing to him thereupon he de-
clared with heat that he couldnt be an
accessory either after or before the fact
those that never went home-who had
nothing to go to perhaps-he interjected
hurriedly could do as they liked he
couldnt he had a wife a family a little
house-paid for-with difficulty-he fol-
lowed the sea respectably out and home
all regular not vagabonding here and there
chumming with the first nigger that came
along and laying traps for his betters

  one of the two flare-bearers sighed at
his elbow and shifted his weight to the
other foot

  these two had been keeping so perfectly
still that the movement was as startling
as if a statue had changed its pose after
looking at the offender with cold malev-

olence shaw went on to speak of law-
courts of trials and of the liberty of the
subject then he pointed out the certitude
and the inconvenience of being found out
affecting for the moment the dispassionate-
ness of wisdom

  there will be fifteen years in jail at
the end of this job for everybody said
shaw and i have a boy that dont know
his father yet fine things for him to
learn when life grows up the innocent
are dead-certain here to catch it along
with you the missus will break her heart
unless she starves first home sold up

  he saw a mysterious iniquity in a dan-
gerous relation to himself and began to
lose his head what he really wanted was
to have his existence left intact for his
own cherishing and pride it was a moral
aspiration but in his alarm the native
grossness of his nature came clattering out
like a devil out of a trap he would blow
the gaff split give away the whole show
he would back up honest people kiss the
book say what he thought let all the world
know-and when he paused to draw
breath all around him was silent and still
before the impetus of that respectable
passion his words were scattered like chaff
driven by a gale and rushed headlong into
the night of the shallows and in the great
obscurity imperturbable he said he
washed his hands of everything

  and the brig said lingard suddenly

  shaw was checked for a second the
seaman in him instinctively admitted the
claim of the ship

  the brig the brig shes right
enough he mumbled

  he had nothing to say against the brig
-not he she wasnt like the big ships
he was used to but of her kind the best
craft he ever   and with a brusk
return upon himself he protested he had
been decoded on board under false pre-
tences it was as bad as being shanghaied
when in liquor it was-upon his soul
and into a craft next thing to a pirate
that was the name for it or his own name
was not shaw he said this glaring owl-
ishly lingard perfectly still and mute
bore the blows without a sign

  he suffered exceedingly and his pain was
simple profound and unjust like that of a
child confronted by the indignation of ab-
surd elders the silly fuss of that man
scared his very soul there was no end to

this plague of fools coming to him from
the forgotten ends of the earth a fellow
like that could not be told no one could
be told blind they came and blind they
would go out

  he admitted reluctantly but without
doubt that as if pushed by a force from
outside he would have to try and save two
of them to this end he foresaw the prob-
able need of leaving his brig for a time
he would have to leave her with that man
-the mate he had engaged him himself-
to make his insurance valid-to be able
sometimes to speak-to have near him
who would have believed such a foolman
could exist on the face of the sea who
leave the brig with him the brig lin-
gard was dismayed in mind and heart

  ever since sunset the breeze kept off
by the heat of the day had been trying to
reestablish in the darkness its sway over
the shoals its approaches had been heard
in the night its patient murmurs its foiled
sighs but now a surprizingly heavy puff
came in a free rush as if far away there
to the northward the last defence of the
calm had been victoriously carried

  the flames borne down streamed blu-
ishly horizontal and noisy at the end of
tall sticks like fluttering pennants and
behold the shadows on the deck went mad
and jostled each other as if trying to
escape from a doomed craft the darkness
held up dome-like by the brilliant glare
seemed to tumble headlong upon the brig
in an overwhelming downfall the men
stood swaying as if ready to fall under the
ruins of a black and noiseless disaster

  the blurred outlines of the brig the
masts the rigging seemed to shudder in
the terror of coming extinction-and then
the darkness leaped upward again the
shadows returned to their places the men
were seen distinct swarthy with calm
faces with glittering eyeballs the de-
struction in the breath had passed was
gone

  a discord of three voices raised together
in a drawling wail trailed on the sudden
immobility of the air

  brig ahoy give us a rope

  the first boat-load from the yacht was
approaching invisible still the malays
with one leap lined the rail shaw picked
up his hat

  hallo answered lingard peering for
the boat



the rescue
romance

  she merged floating slowly into the pool
of purple light wavering round the brig on
the black water two men squeezed in
the bows pulled uncomfortably in the mid-
dle on a heap of seamens canvas bags
another sat insecure propped with both
arms-sat stiff-legged angularly helpless
the light from the poop brought every-
thing out in lurid detail and the boat float-
ing slowly toward the brig had a suspicious
and pitiful aspect the shabby load lum-
bering her looked somehow as if it had
been stolen by those men who resembled
dejected castaways in the stem-sheets
carter standing up steered with his leg
he had a smile of youthful sarcasm

  here they are he cried to lingard
youve got your own way captain i
thought i had better come myself with
the first precious lot-

  pull round the stern the brigs on
the swing interrupted lingard

  aye aye well try not to smash the
brig we would be lost indeed if-fend
off there john fend off old reliable if
you care a pin for your salty tarry hide-
 like the old chap he said when he stood
by lingards side looking down at the boat
which was being rapidly cleared by whites
and malays working shoulder to shoulder
in silence i likethim he dont belong
to that yachting lot either they picked
him up on the road somewhere look at
the old dog-carved out of a ships timber
-talkative like a fish-grim like a gutted
wreck thats the man for me all the
others there are married or going to be
or ought to be or sorry they aint every
man jack of them had a petticoat in tow-
dash me never heard in all my travels
such a jabber about wives and kids the
most affectionate lot of seafaring men i
ever came across-hurry up with your
dunnage-below there

  aye i had no difficulty in getting
them to clear out from the yacht they
are badly shook-i tell you never saw
a pair of gents stolen before-you under-
stand it upset all their little notions of
what a stranding means hereabouts not
that mine arent mixed a bit too-and yet
ive seen a thing or two-i wasnt born
yesterday

  his excitement was revealed in this boy-
ish impulse to talk

   look he said pointing at the growing
pile of bags and bedding on the brigs

quarter-deck look dont they mean
to sleep soft-and dream of home maybe
home think of ihat captain these
chaps can get clear away from it it isnt
like you and me-

  lingard made a movement

  i ran away myself when go high my
old mans a trinity pilot thats a job
worth staying at home for mother writes
sometimes but they cant miss me much
theres fourteen of us altogether-eight
at home yet no fear of the old countty
ever getting undermanned let die who
must theres always plenty more and
i dont care only let it be a fair game
captain lets have a fair show

  lingard assured him briefly he should
have it that was the very reason he
wanted the yachts crew in the brig he
added then quiet and grave he inquired
whether that pistol was still in carters
pocket

  never mind thatj said the young man
hurriedly remember who began to be
shot at wouldnt rile me so much-its
being threatened dont you see that was
lying so heavy on my chest last night
is very  far off though-and i will be
hanged if i know what i meant exactly
when i took the old thing from its nail
and its pretty well the same with me yet
-only i dont feel sure of having been
right after all there more i cant say
till alls settled one way or another will
that do

  flushing brick red he suspended his
judgment and stayed his hand with the
generosity of youth

  apparently it suited lingard to be re-
proved in that form he bowed his head
slowly it would do to leave his life to
that youngsters ignorance seemed to re-
dress the balance of his mind against a lot
of secret intentions it was distasteful and
bitter as an expiation should be it had
the pathos of an exalted futility but it
pacified the clamor of certain whispers

  he also held a life in his hand-a life
and many deaths besides but these were
like one single feather in the scales of his
conscience that he should feel so was
unavoidable because his strength would at
no price permit itself to be wanted it
would not be-and there was an end of it
all he could do was to throw in another
risk into the sea of risks thus was he
enabled to recognize that a drop of water

by joseph conrad
in the ocean makes a great difference he
perceived this as he perceived other things
shadowy and familiar surrounding him-
people facts his own thoughts--a dumb
and disorderly crowd disdainful of reason
bewildered and mighty

  his very desire unconquered but exiled
had left the place where he could con-
stantly hear its voice within him there
had fallen the perplexity of silence and in
the outer darkness the imperative shade
urged him still on as if in irony after the
withdrawal of guidance he saw it he
saw himself the past the future he saw
it all shifting and indistinct like those
shapes the strained eyes of a wanderer
outlines in darker strokes upon the face of
the night

when he went to his boat to follow
carter who bad gone back to the
yacht wasub mast and sail on shoulder
preceded him down the ladder the old
man leaped in smartly and busied himself
in getting the dingey ready

  in that little boat lingard was accus-
tomed to traverse the shallows alone she
had a short mast and a lug-sail carried
two easily floated in a few inches of water
in her he was independent of a crew and
if the wind failed could make his way
with a pair of sculls taking short cuts over
shoal places there were so many islets
and sandbanks that in case of sudden bad
weather there was always a lee to be found
and when he wished to land he could pull
her up a beach striding ahead painter in
hand like a giant child dragging a toy
boat when the brig was anchored within
the shallows it was in her that he visited
the lagoon

  once when caught by a sudden freshen-
ing of the sea-breeze he had waded up a
shelving bank carrying her on his head and
for two days they had rested together on
the sand while around them the shallow
waters raged lividly and across three miles
of foam the brig would time after time
dissolve in the mist and reappear distinct
nodding her tall spars that seemed to
touch a weeping sky of grayness

  whenever he came into the lagoon tug-
ging with bare arms jorgenson who would
be watching the entrance of the creek ever
since a muffled detonation of a gun to sea-

ward had warned him of the brigs arrival
on the coast of refuge would mutter to
himself- heres tom coming in his nut-
shell and indeed she was in shape some-
what like half a nutshell and also in the
color of her dark varnished planks the
mans shoulders and head rose high above
her gunwales loaded with lingards heavy
frame she would climb sturdily the steep
ridges slide squatting into the hollows of
the sea or now and then take a sedate
leap over a short wave her behavior had
a stout trustworthiness about it and she
reminded one of a surefooted mountain-
pony carrying over difficult ground a rider
much bigger than himself

  wasub wiped the thwarts ranged the
mast and sail along the side shipped the
rowlocks lingard looked down at his old
servants spare shoulders upon which the
light from above fell unsteady but vivid
wasub worked for the comfort of his com-
mander and his single-minded absorption
in that task flashed upon lingard the il-
luminating consolation of an act of unex-
pected friendliness the elderly malay at
last lifted his head with a deferential
murmur his wrinkled old face with a half-
dozen wiry hairs pendulous at each corner
of the dark lips expressed a kind of weary
satisfaction and the slightly oblique worn
eyes stole a discreet upward glance con-
taining a hint of some remote meaning
lingard found himself compelled by the
justice of that obscure claim to murmur
as he stepped into the boat

  these are times of danger

  he sat down and took up the sculls
wasub did not shove off the boat and held
on to the gunwale as to a last hope of a
further confidence he had served in the
brig five years lingard remembered that
very well this aged figure had been inti-
mately associated with the brigs life and
with his own appearing silently ready for
every incident and emergency in an un-
questioning expectation of orders symbolic
of blind trust in his strength of an un-
limited obedience to his will was it un-
limited

  we shall require courage and fidelity
added lingard in a tentative tone

 there are those who know me
snapped the old man readily as if the
words had been waiting for a long time
observe tuan i have filled with fresh
water the little beaker in the bows

the rescue
- romance --- v

  i know you too said lingard

  and the wind-and the sea ejaculated
the serang jerkily these also are faith-
ful to the strong by allah i who am a
pilgrim and have listed to words of wisdom
in many places i tell you tuan there is
strength in the knowledge of what is hid-
den in things without life as well as in the
living men will tuan be gone long

  i come back in a short time-together
with the rest of the whites from over there
this is the beginning of many stratagems
wasub daman the son of a dog has
suddenly made prisoners two of my own
people my face is made black

  tse tsct what ferocity is that
one should not offer shame to a friend or
to a friends brother lest revenge come
sweeping like a flood yet can an illanun
chief be other than tyrannical my old
eyes have seen much but they never saw
a tiger change its stripes ya-wal the
tiger can not this is the wisdom of us
ignorant malay men the wisdom of
white tuans is great they think that by
the power of many speeches the tiger
may- he broke off and in a crisp busy
tone said the rudder dwells safely un-
der the aftermost seat should tuan be
pleased to sail the boat this breeze will
not die away before sunrise again his
voice changed as if two different souls had
been flitting in and out of his body no
no kill the tiger and then the stripes may
be counted without fear-one by one
thus

  he pointed a frail brown finger and
abruptly made a mirthless dry sound as if
a rattle had been sprung in his throat
the wretches are many said lingard
nay tuan they follow their great
men even as we in the brig follow you
that is right

  lingard reflected for a moment

  my men will follow me then he said
they are poor calashes without sense
commented wasub with pitying superior-
ity some with no more comprehension
than men of the bush freshly caught there
is sali the foolish son of my sister and
by your great favor appointed to mind the
tiller of this ship his stupidity is ex-
treme but his eyes are good-nearly as
good as mine that by praying and much
exercise can see far into the night
lingard laughed low and then looked
earnestly at the serang above their heads

a man shook a flare over the side and a
thin shower of sparks floated downward
and expired before touching the water

  so you can see in the night o serang
well then look and speak speak fight
-or no fight weapons or words-which
folly well what do you see

  a darkness a darkness whispered
wasub at last in a frightened tone there
are nights- he shook his head and mut-
tered look the tide has turned ya
tuan the tide has turned

  lingard looked downward where the
water could be seen gliding past the ships
side moving smoothly streaked with lines
of froth across the illumined circle thrown
round the brig by the lights on her poop
air bubbles sparkle lines of darkness
ripples of glitter appeared glided went
astern without a splash without a trickle
without a plaint without a break

  the unchecked gentleness of the flow
captured the eye by a subtle spell fastened
insidiously upon the mind a disturbing
sense of the irretrievable the ebbing of
the sea athwart the lonely sheen of flames
resembled the eternal ebb-tide of time
and when at last he looked up the knowl-
edge of that noiseless passage of the wa-
ters produced on his mind a bewildering
effect

  for a moment the speck of light lost in
vast obscurity the brig the boat the hid-
den coast the shallows the very walls and
roof of darkness-the seen and the unseen
alike seemed to be gliding smoothly on-
ward through the enormous gloom of space
then with a great mental effort he brought
everything to a sudden standstill and only
the froth and bubbles went on streaming
past ceaselessly unchecked by the power
of his will

  the tide has turned-as you say
serang has it well perhaps it has
perhaps it has he finished muttering to
himself

  truly it has can not tuan see it run
under his own eyes said wasub with an
alarmed earnestness look now it is
in my mind that a prau coming from
amongst the southern islands if steered-
cunningly in the free set of the current
would approach the bows of this our brig
drifting silently as a shape without a sub-
stance

  and board suddenly-is that it said
lingard

by joseph conrad


   daman is crafty and the illanuns are
 very bloodthirsty night is nothing to
 them they are certainly valorous are
 they not born in the midst of fighting and
 are they not inspired by the evil of their
 hearts even before they can speak and
 their chiefs would be leading them while

 you tuan are going even now-

   you dont want me to go asked lin-
 gard

   for a time wasub listened attentively
 to the profound silence

    can we fight without a leader he be-
 gan again it is the belief in victory that
 gives courage and what would poor
 calashes do sons of peasants and fisher-
 men freshly caught-without knowledge
 they believe in your strength-and in your
 power-or else-whites that come so sud-

	denly avenge you they are here like
 fish within the stakes ya-wa who will
 bring the news and who will come to find
 the truth and perchance to carry off your
 body you are alone tuan

    wasubs words sank into lingards heart
 as lead sinks into the water he sat
 musing wasub tired of stooping
 squatted on the bottom step and held on
 to the boat patiently

   i must go-to daman said lingard at
 last i shall remain only a littletime
 only a little-very true perhaps all
 the life muttered the serang

   there must be no fighting it would
 be a calamity insisted lingard there
 is blood that must not be spilt

   hear tuan exclaimed wasub with
 heat the waters are running out now
 he punctuated his speech by slight jerks
 at the dingey the waters go and at the
 appointed time they shall return and if
 between their going and coming the blood
 of all the men in the world were poured
 into it the sea would not rise higher at the
 full by the breadth of my finger nail
 but the world would not be the same
 you do not see that serang give the boat
 a good shove

   directly said the old malay and his
 face became impassive tuan knows
 when it is best to go and death sometimes
 retreats before a firm tread like a startled
 snake tuan should take a follower with
 him not a silly youth but one who has
 lived-who has a steady heart-who would
 walk close behind watchfully-and quietly
 yes quietly and with quick eyes-like

mine-perhaps with a weapon-i know
how to strike

  lingard looked at the wrinkled visage
very near his own and into the peering old
eyes they shone strangely a tense
eagerness was expressed in the squatting
figure leaning out toward him on the
other side within reach of his arm the
night stood like a wall-discouraging-
opaque-impenetrable no help would
avail the darkness he had to combat was
too impalpable to be cleft by a blow-too
dense to be pierced by the eye yet as if by
some enchantment in the words that made
this vain offer of fidelity it became less
overpowering to his sight less crushing to
his thought he had a moment of pride
which soothed his heart for the space of
two beats it yras like a lull in the stress
of a gale like a hint of safety to be found
somewhere in the world if only life endures
long enough to wear out the turmoil it
was an instant qf rare ampleness in which
his unreasonable and misjudged heart
shrinking before the menace of failure
could expand freely with a sense of gener-
ous gratitude in the threatening dimness
of his emotions this mans offer made a
point of clearness the glimmer of a torch
held aloft in the night it was priceless
no doubt but ineffectual-too small too
far too solitary it did not dispel the
mysterious obscurity that had descended
upon his fortunes so that his eyes could
no longer see the work of his hands the
sadness of defeat pervaded the world

  and what could you do o wasub
he said

  i could always call out-take care
tuan 

  and then for these charm-words of
mine hey turn danger aside what
but perchance you would die all the same
treachery is a strong magic too-as you
said

  yes indeed the order might come to
your servant but i-wasub-the son of
a free man a follower of rajahs a fugitive
a slave a pilgrim-diver for pearls serang
of white mens ships i have had too many
masters too many you are the last
after a silence he said in an almost indif-
ferent voice if you go tuan let us go
together

  for a time lingard made no sound

  no use he said at last no use
serang one life is enough to pay for a



the rescue
mans folly-and you have a household
 i have two-tuan but it is a long time
since i sat on the ladder of a house to talk
at ease with neighbors yes two house-
holds one in - lingard smiled faintly
tuan let me follow you

  no you have said -it serang-i am
alone that is true and alone i shall go
on this very night but first i must bring
all the white people here push

   ready tuan look out 

  wasubs body swung over the sea with
extended arms lingard caught up the
sculls and as the dingey darted away
from the brigs side he had a complete
view of the lighted poop shaw leaning
massively over ihe taffrail in sulky dejec-
tion the flare-bearers erect and rigid the
heads along the rail the eyes staring after
him above the bulwarks the fore-end of
the little vessel was wrapped in a lurid
and somber mistiness the sullen mingling
of darkness and of light her masts point-
ing straight up could be tracked by torn
gleams and vanished above as if the trucks
had been tall enough to pierce the heavy
mass of vapors motionless overhead she
was beautifully precious his loving eyes
saw her floating at rest in a wavering halo
between an invisible sky and an invisible
sea like a miraculous craft suspended in
the air

  he turned his head away as if the sight
had been too much for him at the moment
of separation and as soon as his little boat
had passed beyond the limit of the light
thrown upon the water he perceived very-
low in the black void of the west the stern
lantern of the yacht shining feebly like a
star about to set unattainable infinitely
remote-belonging lo another universe

book iv
the visit to the emma
i

lingard brought mrs travers away
from the yacht going alone with her
in the little boat during the bustle of
the embarkment and till the last of the
crew had left the schooner he had remained
towering and silent by her side a smoky
lantern hung under the main-boom lighted
their heads and shoulders she had given

nce

him only one glance and then looked down
but he looked at her continuously his
passive strength seemed to watch the inten-
sity of her meditation

  neither of them gave during the half-
hour a single thought to the unfortunate
captives not these two men alone but
all mankind not only this coast and these
two shallows but the whole earth itself
was too far away from their mood to be
of the slightest importance it was only
when the murmuring and uneasy voices of
the sailors going away in the boats had
been completely lost in the distance that
his voice was heard grave in the silence
pronouncing the words-follow me
she followed him their footsteps rang hol-
low and loud on the empty deck at the
bottom of the steps he turned round and
said very low-take care

  he got into the boat and held on it
seemed to him that she was intimidated by
the darkness she felt her arm gripped
firmly-ive got you he said she
stepped in headlong trusting herself
blindly to the grip and sank on the stern
seat catching her breath a little she heard
a slight splash and the indistinct side of
the deserted yacht melted suddenly into
the body of the night

  rowing he faced her a hooded and
cloaked shape and above her head he had
before his eyes the gleam of the stem lan-
tern expiring slowly on the abandoned ves-
sel when it went out without a warning
flicker he could see nothing of the stranded
yachts outline she had vanished utterly
like a dream and the occurrences of the
last twenty-four hours seemed also to be a
part of a vanished dream the hooded
and cloaked figure was part of it too it
spoke not it moved not it would vanish
presently he tried to remember her fea-
tures even as she sat within two feet of
him in the boat he seemed to have taken
from that vanished schooner not a woman
but a memory-the tormenting recollection
of a human being he would see no more

  at every stroke of the short sculls she
felt the boat leap forward with her lin-
gard to keep his direction had to look
over his shoulder frequently

  you shall be safe in the brig he said

  she was silent a dream a dream he lay
back vigorously the water slapped loudly
against the blunt bows the ruddy glow-
thrown afar by the flares was reflected

by j oseph conrad
romance

deep within the hood the dream had a
pale visage the memory had living eyes

  i had to come for you myself he said

  i expected it of you

  these were the first words he had heard
her say since they had met for the third
time

  and i swore-before you too-that i
would never put my foot on board your
craft-

  it was good of you to- she began

  i forgot somehow he said simply

  i expected it of you she repeated

  he gave three quick strokes before he
asked very gently

  what else do you expect

  everything she said

  he was rounding then the stern of the
brig and had to look away then he
turned to her

  and you believe he exclaimed

   i like to believe she interrupted be-
cause-

  above them a startled voice cried in
malay captain coming the abrupt
and strange sound silenced her lingard
laid in his sculls and she saw herself gliding
under the high side of the brig a dark
staring face appeared very near her eyes
black fingers caught the gunwale of the
boat she stood up swaying

  take care said lingard again but
this time in the light did not offer to help
her

  she went up alone and he followed her
over the rail

  the quarter-deck was thronged by men
of two races they crossed it rapidly be-
tween the groups that moved out of the
way on their passage lingard threw open
the cabin door for her but remained on
deck to inquire about his boats they had
returned while he was on board the yacht
and the two men in charge of them came
aft to make their reports

  the boat sent north had seen nothing
the boat which had been directed to ex-
plore the banks and islets to the south had
actually been in sight of damans praus
which were anchored under the shelter of
one of these small islands the man in
charge reported that several fires were

  burning on the shore the crews of the
two praus being encamped on the beach
cooking was going on they had been
near enough to hear the voices the islet
was only an elongated sand-dune with thin
grass and lank scrub on the ridge there
was a man keeping watch on the ridge
they knew this because they heard him
once shouting to the people below by the
fires lingard wanted to know how they
had managed to remain unseen

  the night was our hiding-place an-
swered the man in his deep growling voice

  he knew nothing of any white men be-
ing in damans camp why should there
be rajah hassim and the lady his sis-
ter appeared unexpectedly in their canoe
rajah hassim had ordered him in whis-
pers to go back to the brig at once and
tell tuan what he had observed rajah
hassim said that he would return to the
brig with more news very soon he obeyed
because rajah was to him a person of
authority having the perfect knowledge
of tuans mind as we all know

  enough cried lingard suddenly

  the man looked up heavily for a mo-
ment and retreated forward without an-
other word lingard followed him with
irritated eyes a new power had come
into the world had possessed itself of hu-
man speech had imparted to it a sinister
irony of allusion to be told that some
one had a perfect knowledge of his mind
startled him and made him wince it made
him aware that now he did qot know it
himself-that it seemed impossible for him
ever to regain that knowledge and the
new power not only had cast its spell upon
the words he had to hear but also upon
the facts that assailed him upon the peo-
ple he saw upon the thoughts he had to
guide upon the feelings he had to bear
they remained what they had ever been-
the visible surface of life open in the sun
to the conquering tread of an unfettered
will yesterday they could have been dis-
cerned clearly mastered and despised but
now another power had come into the
world and had cast over them all the
wavering gloom of a dark and inscrutable
purpose

the captain of the bear-cats
slouched rebelliously over a dog-
eared arithmetic in the privacy of
his own room contemplating with
unseeing eyes an absurd query as to the
percentage of arable land owned by a
creature the rest of whose uninteresting
property consisted in so many acres of
wood and garden it wa almost at the
end of a day by no means perfect

   on top of a more or less hectic session
 at school wherein he had been unjustly
 singled out for persistent persecution be-
 cause of his red head had appeared his
 report cheerfully borne home by his sister
 in the grade below his its varied per-
 centages resembling a temperature chart
 in the fluctuations from normal or passing
 mark

   and then right off the reel didnt
 that crab of an old lady ellis come bounc-
 ing in and claim that the bear-cats were
 a nuisance and had broken down her hedge
 hunting for balls and that their language
 was such as she wouldnt have her jamie
 hear much less his sister

   for result here now was russell joyce
 kingdon marooned over his books while
 from the bear-cats athaletic field
  finiec  lree blocks of suburban tree-
 nlled space came the joyous melody of
 the team in practice without him

   yes they could laugh and shout and

 ganized them provided them a clubroom

 self with must be shut away from every-
 thing just because of the spite of a lot
 of senile fussbudgets who happened to have
 recognized him from among the throng
 having a red head was a regular identi-
 fication chart it wasnt fair

  from time to time with practiced hand
he sketched on the margin of his book the
brutal features of his critics the tale-bear-
ing snakes who had brought this punish-
ment upon him and who were threatening
to plow up the only vacant lot for a
mile around suitable for a diamond lest
full recognition of the portraits fail he
carefully appended the names garnished
with vivid concrete verbiage

  he was securing a measure of melan-
choly satisfaction from the task when his
ears caught the voice of his brother rupert
a blase and cynical pessimist in third-year
high school discussing him with his
mother over the pruning of some vines

  i told you didnt i just how it would
be mom rupert was chanting that
little runt puts it all over you and pop
right along and gets away with it that
gang of roughnecks he trains with makes
my foot ache letting them hav the
garage room was the last straw i was
thinking of setting a hen there theyll
raise heck up there you mark my words
but rupert twelve-year-old boys have
to have some place to let off steam in
theyve trained in the attic all winter
until i couldnt hear myself think and now
that its warm enough for them to play in
the garage i thought they could have a

lot of fun with a club there-

  oh theyll have fun all right agreed



way of a sire with a son

by gertrude mac nulty stevens
the pessimist sourly of course its noth-
ing to me i dont have to pay for the
windows they smash or the furniture thats
busted i just dont want to be blamed
for the cookies bud sneaks out to treat
the gang on or the apples and they
neednt think they can give me any of
their lip like bud tried to show off yester-
day when i told him to come down off the
roof where he was kicking off shingles to

make airplane rud-

  flesh and blood could stand no more
bang went up russells window and out
popped his glowing head

  youre another i was just getting a
loose one think you can bull me all the
time for two cents fd just tell mamma
where that half mince pie went to yester-
day-

  rupert dropped his shears and reached
for a clod

  and for lessn half that id let you
have this in the ear 

  but the window banged tauntingly
down and mrs kingdons rebuking
rupert how old are you anyway fell
on deaf ears

  russell returned to his gloomy medita-
tions it occurred to him once that he
might possibly get through his penance
in time for a little practice before sun-
down but a glance along the seven prob-
lems remaining to be done gave little hope
of such accomplishment he heard his
mother call jessica in to practice her
music and saw rupert dawdling up the
hill with a barrow-load of rose cuttings
then a cautious syncopated whistle trem-
bled on the air from the hedge and
shorty small peered up at the window

  russell threw up the sash and leaned
out

   lo short what you know
nothin xcept harve kendalls come
over to watch the cats work and he
wants to see you pitch sos to find out if
liell get his team to play us he just
laughs at jos pitching say cm on over
cant you he makes me sick

  who

harve hs ridin a pony somebodys
boardin at his fathers and he says hes
gettin two dollars a week fr exercisin it
likely lie whynt he tell a good one
whiles hes bout it anyhow

   s what i say payin anybody fr
ridin a pony

  they chuckled appreciatively then
shorty continued

  how soon can you get out

  got seven more to do-those doggone
problems

  seven we only had eight aint you
done but one

  russell frowned fiercely
i cant do em no sense to the dern
things

  throw out the book and ill get
sharky allen to do em for you hes one
of those fellers that just eats rithmetic up
i cn take it right over now while you do
your grammar and bring em back in a
jiff

  here you go

  a thin book whirled through the air to
land neatly in shortys hands

  whistle twice when you come back
now beat it that old pie-face rupes
cornin down the hill

  the captain of the bear-cats closed the
window softly and returned to his desk
he did not feel entirely comfortable over
the arrangement deceit being really foreign
to his nature but what is a feller to do
when grown-ups are so unreasonable on a
fine spring day with a rival ball captain
waiting to pass judgment on your curve
and control

  anyhow i never speck to use rith-
metic when i grow up any more n ive
got now he mused i can make change
and thats enough

  his views on grammar were highly simi-
lar with the added certainty that undue
use thereof was distinctly sissy no
reglar feller ever said it is i and why
any human being shouldobject to aint
and them kind he had never been able
to figure out

  however at the present moment there
was certainly nobody even to attempt
writing for him the ten sentences with the
modifiers of various idiotic sorts since not
one bear-cat was any more of a gram-
marian than himself he must perforce
attack them unaided

  he concentrated valiantly and with such
success that he was finishing the last one
when shortys jubilant but restrained
whistle sounded and he answered it with
the corresponding cat-call also repressed
cautiously his hands were outstretched
for the folded paper when ruperts voice
again broke officiously into his affairs

the way of a sire with a son
jfs romance --

  on your way kid russ cant cpme
out hes got to get his lessons

  aw i just want to toss him some-
thing

   give it here ill take it to him my
mother dont want you kids running up
there disturbing him he cant come out
till he does his problems

   its a wonder you cant ever mind your
own business mr butt-in-ski yelled
russell somewhat alarmed and thoroughly
annoyed cant short even gimme a list
of the line-up thout you pokin your old
nose into our fairs here go short i i
got it so long ah-h think youre
smart dont you ever get left

   again the window banged down but not
before a skillfully hurled pebble zipped
close to russells ear sure evidence of the
resentment of age against the flippancy of
youth

  five minutes later russell presented
himself at his mothers elbow where she
watched jessica struggling with that tender
little piano piece when rover was a
puppy-dog

  all done mom can i go now the
fellers re waitin fr me

   mrs kingdon looked her surprize

   so soon all the sentences too jes-
sica you have the wrong note it is b
the examples too i thought you would
have to have me help you on them are
you sure theyre all done

  russells expression was steady and
virtuous it was indeed lucky that she had
put the query thus impersonally they
wer done sure that was no fib

   you can find em right up on my desk
all right ill be back soon

  he wheeled about leaving the rug a
mass of outraged wrinkles and ducking
under ruperts blockading arms gained
the hall door

   the team greeted russell with a roar of
welcome that warmed his heart and even
penetrated to the family library where
rupert still lingered cap on and shoulders
hunched gazing out of the window

   rmert do take off your cap admon-
isv- mrs kingdon you mustnt be so
hard on the little fellow i would have
much less trouble with him if you would
co-operate with me a little

  co-operate sniffed rupert you
need to co-operate with a shingle on him
ou and pon talk too much to him and

dont lick him enough hes getting away
with a lot of stuff that  got good and
walloped for when i was his age i guess
if you heard some of the talk he puts out
youd drop dead

  mrs ellis has been complaining of the
language used on the ball-field by her
house i do feel very uneasy about it
now that is surely something you could
help with rupert a small boy is easily

influenced for good by an older one-

  rupert emitted a derisive hoot
influence a hen why mom that
bunch is as tough as they come you dont
know them theyre hellions
rupert

  thats what

  mrs kingdon sighed

  and mrs ellis says that every time her
jamie comes near the ball-field the bear-
cats throw stones at him why rupert i
dont see anything funny about that
rupert tried vainly to swallow a grin
he was at the age when stoicism is the
only virtue

  aw i wish theyd throw a peck of
em jamie elliss a perfect lady dont
know enough to go in when it rains hi
there went a clean hit through the hen-
house window now watch the fur fly
he hastened out of the house and down
the road mrs kingdon made a half-
hearted effort to prevent the excited jes-
sica from joining the flight to the ball-
field gave it up in despair and went out
on the porch herself

  she could see a group of boys eddying
about a tall woman in the cerr of the
diamond revealing from time to time a
red and white sweater in which she recog-
nized russell even at that distance it
was apparent that the tall woman was in
an abnormal state of mind and mrs king-
dons intuitive surmise that russell had
some connection therewith was made a
certainty by the return presently of ru-
pert the assured triumph of the bearer
of prophesied bad news in his gait

  just what i told you mom russ
batted that ball through the ellis chicken-
house a right good punch for a kid and
he was feeling some chesty about it you
bet i got there just as he was telling
the gang that there was no use looking
for the ball as it was probablv half-wav

  just what he was saying and then old
mrs ellis popped out of the house and lit

on him like a thousand of brick-

  rupert shes not old at all younger
than  am probably

  well she acts like it anyhow and
she says shell have the field plowed up at
her own expense to keep the cats off
and shes going to complain to pop about
russs language russ gave her some more

lip then-

  oh rupert what did he say

  never you mind rupert was darkly
mysterious anyway here he comes
you can ask him i told you he was
getting too fresh but you wouldnt believe
me you and pop are so tender with him
makes me sick

  mrs kingdon turned on him her eyes
flashing

  for goodness sake do stop croaking
your continual criticism of the child only
makes it harder for me to manage him
go finish the roses do or set a hen or
climb a tack anybody would think you
a grandfather how long is it id like
to know since you were at the same
tricks

  rupert disappeared around the corner
of the house muttering disparaging things
about the rising generation and the cap-
tain of the bear-cats seeing no chance of
evading his mother by a circuitous route
lunged across -the lawn and up the steps
before mrs kingdon could make up her
mind just which of many remarks she
would make he burst forth into a vehement
flood of vituperation against the whole
ellis family including even their supposi-
tious ancestry in the oration and ending
with dark threats of what the team in-
tended as reprisal it was somewhat too
well done to be entirely convincing
even the most casual listener might have
suspected the sincerity of the speaker
and moreover mrs kingdon was no
stranger to the method having three other
sons to her credit older than russell

  she let him run on till breath failed
-then russell go right upstairs and
take a good bath she said

  aw mom i had one yesterday or day
before

  this was a tactical error on russells
part his mothers eyes fixed him coldly

  and shampoo your head i will come
up myself presently and do your neck and

ears tonight your father will talk to you
about this affair on the ball-field

  russell departed breathing out threat-
enings and slaughter as mr kingdons
car stopped at their comer

  mrs kingdon waited until after dinner
before broaching the matter of the bear-
cats vs mrs ellis many years of mar-
ried life had brought a measure of wisdom
to her

  russells father received the story after
a hearty meal when care sits but lightly
on any man he assumed his customary
easy manner and attempted to make light
of the whole affair

  so that was the reason bud looked so
chaste and subdued and cleaned up gener-
ally i thought something must have
happened when he was so polite at table
batted one through the hen-house window
looks like a whale of a punch from here

  now jerry i do wish youd be serious
for once mrs ellis is very much wrought
up about it and is going to bring the whole
matter of the bear-cats up before the
civic club tomorrow night she thinks
something ought to be done about them

  lord what can be done boys have
to play dont they its better to have
em playing near home where some sort of
an eye can be kept on em than to shove
them off on the edge of town by them-
selves or worse isnt it let bud pay
for the glass out of his savings and ill
try to get her to put netting over that
window so this cant happen again the
bad language hm well now i guess
all kids have to let off a little steam in a
game dont they oh of course ill
speak to him about it and tell you what
ill knock off early tomorrow afternoon
and come on home and umpire a game
for them ill get harris trescott and
john coyle to lay off too and renew their
youth their kids are bear-cats too it
may be a good idea to pal a bit with the
younkers i used to be some sand-lot
pitcher myself and trescott was a breeze
on the bases come here bud howd
you like to have your dad and mr trescott
and mr coyle give the bear-cats the
once-over tomorrow and referee a game
for you

  russell received the news with unflatter-
ing protest 

  aw pop you dont wanta do that
you couldnt help us any and the fellers

ico

the way of a sire with a son
romance

wouldnt like it aint it bad nough to
have old lady ellis always spyin on us
thout havin your own folks too

  where do you get that spy stuff in-
quired mr kingdon with some heat
and as for helping you master swell-
head i want you to know that we men
used to play better ball than you shrimps
ever will you ought to be glad to have
us take time to come out and give you a
few pointers moreover it looks as if some
of the complaints i hear of the cats were
justified when you dont want your parents
to watch your games you round up that
outfit tomorrow in good shape well be
out at  and to his wife he added
as russell departed-can you beat a kid
for ingratitude

   russells prophetic soul had not deceived
him as to the reception of the news by
his team to a man every cat suspected
the proposed visitation of malign and ulte-
rior motives and frankly assailed russell
for not having headed it off

  aw you could of too whynt you
tell him we didnt have a game on
shorty small demanded

  didnt think quick enough besides he
knows we play every day russell de-
fended no use grouchin they most
probly wont stay long no seats to sit
down on out there-only the ground
theres their car lets get into some
practice till the zulus come aint that
sissy ellis grandpa with em

  oh gosh yes hes fussiern the old
lady wouldnt let me get a ball outer
his garden last week hope he chokes
the team practiced madly paying no
attention beyond an embarrassed grin or
two from shamed sons as the quartet of
men drew near captain kingdon in a
wind-up that distorted his small person
from feet to physiognomy sent a wild
pitch past his backstop far into the field
whence it was retrieved by a bevy of
shrieking small girls whom the presence
of the fathers encouraged to approach the
forbidden grounds

  better cut out the curves son and
stick to your straight ones advised mr
kingdon kindly first thing you know
youll get a glass arm no kid your size
ought to be curving a ball

   messrs trescott and coyle interpolated
various suggestions to their offspring at
first base and short-stop respectively

  russell glared at them all from beneath
his visored cap so that was what this
bunch of old guys had come for giving
out advice hm he could feel the
waves of resentment emanating from the
team bitterly was he conscious that they
were blaming him for it as if he had
asked these hoary fossils to come here

he relinquished the ball to his understudy
and went to the plate for his turn at
batting only by violently assaulting
something did he think that his feelings
could be relieved with all his force he
swung at the first ball pitched only to cut
into the unresisting air and nearly topple x
over

  a second time he did it and a third
then grandpa jennings high-pitched
laugh pierced his ear

  that kid never busted none of our
hen-house winders you neednt tell me
he cackled bet i cd beat that myself
if i am a grandfatherl

  it was unendurable a red rage flooded
russells whole being twelve years of
parental drilling on the respect due to age
fell from him like a torn shirt furiously
throwing down his bat and cap he shouted
as he stalked from the diamond

  all right whynt you go on in and
prove it

  gentlemen i blush for my che-ild
mr kingdon apologized turning off with
a jest as was his custom a difficult situa-
tion lets accept the challenge and show
em get in behind the plate coyle
how about you at first trescott one
minute for a warm-up mr jennings and
you go in to bat

  the bear-cats circled off to the side-
lines their faces registering mingled emo-
tions of amusement and annoyance deeply
tingled with shame on the part of those
pitiable three whose parents were thus
making an exhibition of themselves

  there was no doubt about the enjoy-
ment of the men their coats and hats
came off in a jiffy sleeves were rolled up
and collar discarded the warm-up con-
tinued until russell demanded scathingly
of shorty whether he supposed these old
ginks meant to hog the whole afternoon
buttin in on their game

  grandpa jennings took his stand at the
plate at last however

  now none of your fancy tricks on me
kingdon he admonished im thirty

years out of practice but i used to be a
husky hitter on a straight one we never
had no curves in my day

  he let the first two balls go by with-
out an effort

  thems no good- he remarked calmly
theyre good for two strikes asserted
lr kingdon

  the devil they are flared the old
man one of em was round my neck
and tother two feet wide o the plate
youre a - er - youre mistaken
shouted mr kingdon  they were per-
fect strikes how about it coyle

  we need an umpire mr coyle replied
diplomatically isnt that rupert over by
the apple tree come on over and umpire
rupe we need you

  rupert at his fathers shout reluctantly
took a few steps toward them

  aw you dont want me pop get
somebody outside the family theres the
ice-man ask him

  the ice-man accepted the commission
with alacrity

  batter up bawled the ice-man in
true big league style and again the ball
sped toward grandpa who stood with feet
well apart and bat firmly clenched between
his fists the light of a grim determination
in his eyes by now the original audience
of bear-cats had been augmented by the
arrival of the other team several delivery
wagons and a miscellaneous aggregation
of pedestrians of the male sex whose com-
ments and criticisms stimulated the players

  mr kingdon took an impressive wind-
up and let the ball leave his hand in a
mighty heave grandpa met it with a
powerful swing out and back the ball
recoiled from the bat in a vicious foul tip
that catcher coyle entirely misjudged
falling all over himself amid the spec-
tators and picking himself up with several
unfortunate remarks that he muffled too
late

  get up on your toes you undertaker
yelled mr kingdon quite forgetful of the
audience what do you think this is a
rest-cure

  mr coyle responded by throwing the
ball straight at him and so swiftly that
the pitcher had no time to put up his
glove so was forced to stop it with his
floating ribs a proceeding that caused him
to utter words he would later fain have
retracted

  dry up and play ball exhorted grand-
pa who was having the time of his life
this time im a-goin to knock her to
key west

  and the event justified the brag it
was in very truth a whale of a wallop
a long clean drive that sailed like a gleam-
ing arrow straight for the dining-room win-
dow of his daughters home smashing it
into a sunburst of twinkling glass and
upsetting two geraniums and an angora cat
that adorned the sill

  for one eye-wink of eternity the world
stood hushed then arose a mighty paan of
pure joy led by the captain of the bear-
cats and ably sustained by every human
being on the field even to the stoic
rupert

  my godfrey daniels how in heck did
i ever come to do a dodgasted thing like
that is what grandpa jennings stoutly
insists he stated anent the affair but the
bear-cats to a cat knew better and hesi-
tated not to say so with addenda to the
end of their days

  in the thick of the confusion appeared
mrs ellis from the house and before she
could articulate a word her father as-
sumed the offensive

  now mary lizbeth he said sternly
dont ye say a word not a word i
alius knew that there winder was pinted
the wrong way there never was no call
fr a winder on that side the house any-
how only thing ye can dos to put a
good heavy wire screen acrost it and
that ill tend to myself termorrer there
aint no other place where these boys can
play-

  i hear you father replied his daugh-
ter ominously and furthermore i
heard you a few minutes ago i have sent
jamie into the house-

  the old man drew himself up to his
full height the light of conflict still gleam-
ing in his eyes

  mary lizbeth he ordered you go
right in there after him ill talk to you
later

  their eyes crossed like rapiers for a
second then mrs ellis turned and went
swiftly across the field to her back door
through which she disappeared with a
resounding slam of the screen

  now looky here boys said grandpa
jennings ingratiatingly which one of
yous captain of this team

ioi

the way of a sire with a son
  several hands pushed forward the pro-
testing russell

  here he is-russ kingdon

  hm aint you the boy that plowed
up my lettuce bed with a ball last week
russell acknowledged it

  hm favor your paw dont ye
well  was sorter hot bout that but i
dont feel so bad now fd kind o like
to make a deal with you if youll take
my grandson on the team and learn him

to play-

  a murmur of dissent rose from the bear-
cats and one bold spirit voiced the club
segment aloud

  aw he dont know a hit from a sand-
hill and hes fraid of the ball

  i know it but you boys can learn him
better and if youll take him on and jus
keep kinder quiet about what happened
here today ill buy you a bat and ball-a
reglar league ball

  the bear-cats looked at one another
and a glorious sun of possibilities rose in
their minds they nudged russell and
he understood mr kingdon and the other
fathers were struggling into their coats
the bear-cats faced them joyously

  why we dont mind keeping it quiet
said russell and he looked his father full
in the eyes of course weve got a rule

about cussing but-

  mr kingdon was nobodys fool he
turned to the other men with a compelling
grin

  guess we better come into this too
trescott how about it coyle i think
the bear-cats need a catchers mask that
i can get and a few base bags and a chest
protector would come in handy are you
with me

  i am said john coyle and harris
trescott chimed in with the same sug-
gestion that the civic club might be in-
duced to provide a backstop of wire as a
measure of self-protection

  gradually the field cleared of all save
the captain of the bear-cats who stayed
to retrieve the club property as he gath-
ered up the last bat a long shadow fell
across his vision and a hesitant figure
drew near him

   to russ said jamie ellis

  hi jim responded russell cordially
and let us here state in passing that
jamie died right then and there in favor
of jim

  hi jim say your grandpas a reglar
feller howd you like to come on the
team and field for us we got to lose
fats cause hes going on the school team
will your mother let you

  sure she will piped jim joyfully
grandpa said right before her that hed
lick the tar outer me if  didnt learn to
play ball say russ can i come over
before school and catch with you some

  that night to the corner of the kingdon
porch where the heads of the family rested
from their labors and recounted the days
occurrences came the slow and painful
clicking of a typewriter impelled by a
searching unskilled forefinger

  whos at my machine mr kingdon
began but his wife checked him

  now jerry dont fuss its russell
hes formulating some new rules for the
club  saw the first three when he left
ihe machine a while ago im sure youd
endorse them she threw him a search-
ing mischievous glance

  what are they

  rule i bad langwige of any kind postifev
furbidden in this club any offender will lc
immeditelv kicked oul at once and i mean it

  rule -

  mr kingdon threw up his hands

  dont shoot ill come down h
begged maybe you dont know it but
that rule is going to cost me the new
mashie ive been saving two months to get
but if you could have seen old man jen-
nings face when he realized his daughter
had heard him you would agree with me
that it was worth the price and then
some

  and what did you say pursued mrs
kingdon with interest

  her husband regarded her with what he
would like to have made a severe frown
but which changed into a sheepish grin

 never you mind madam he said
ive sent jessica to the drug-store to buy
you some chocolate mints i guess i cant
afford to take any more afternoons off for
a while

     by carl clausen

alameda street the one time
fashionable residence street of los
angeles lay chill and deserted
under the flickering arclights a
lazy drizzle of rain descended from the
leaden sky that hung oppressively low over
the dully gleaming chasm of the street
gusts of wind-driven rain tore around the
corners shaking cascades of accumulated
rainwater from the dripping awnings
here and there a light from a store whose
owner had been delayed with his accounts
after the rest of the shops had put up their
shutters fell across the glistening sidewalk
within these isolated squares of light the
raindrops seemed to fall more rapidly as if
they were hastening to return to the earth
before being discovered

  young andrew gaynor walked with
hunched shoulders and upturned coat-collar
at a quick pace along the deserted street
past the narrow mouth of jackson alley
a mere slit of a thoroughfare between two
gray walls four stories in height it was a
night when people hugged the glowing
warmth of their hearthfires unless business
or peculiar temperament drove them forth
andrew rather liked it it gave him a sense
of exhilaration to feel the needlelike sting
of the raindrops upon his cheeks as if they
were whipping some hitherto dormant
power within him into battle with the ele-
ments

  as he strode along warmed by the bod-
ily glow from his brisk walk he thought
about the drab loneliness of his past life
and compared it with his present after
eight  ars of tramping the seas as a com-

mon sailor he had suddenly taken his place
among the dwellers of the solid earth and
was beating them at their own game his
one year at business college had served
only to open his eyes to the futility of hop-
ing to cope with a world already intrenched
against interlopers like himself

  at first he had thought of returning to
the sea but after meeting john devor a
fellow-student at the business college a
vague but no less firm desire to batter
down the bulwarks to success had taken
hold of him john devor was a struggling
artist a painter of miniatures attending
the night-school to learn geometry when
he had gained sufficient knowledge the
school would know him no longer during
recess and their walks home together after
school andrew had listened with beating
heart to devors story of his life devor
had been a window-trimmer a natural
love for color and artistic arrangement had
been responsible for this latter choice of
profession even now when funds were
low he went back to his old trade for a
few days to keep the pot boiling but he
was winning slowly but steadily the
mans courage and enthusiasm had fired
andrew with ambition

  the old desire to write that had long
lain dormant in his heart burst into flame
he andrew gaynor would write he
would speak to the hearts intrenched be-
hind the barriers of money and caste and
would force them to open their portals he
would bridge in one span the gulf that
separated him from the land-dwellers

  he went about it methodically at the


romance

age of sixteen he had deserted school in
favor of the sea the things he had learned
so easily and thought so unimportant in
those years suddenly took new and un-
dreamed of value he began to read
avidly everything he could lay his hands
on from daylight until dark he haunted
the public library he discovered to his
delight a new strange country between the
dusty shelves he discovered also that
speech like his the sailor vernacular was
ridiculed by most writers-lightly by
some but ridiculed always he decided
from that moment hed be more careful
in his speech

  when the attendant took his halting
request he noted the inflection of her voice
and her manner of pronouncing her words
in his room at night he held a series of
lectures to himself in monologue to cure
himself of his defect of speech he
worked prodigiously into the small hours
of the night talked with people who seemed
to know things haunted literary clubs and
lecture-halls

  his first literary efforts wefe crude
things written in the sweat of his brow
but by close observance and honest self-
criticism he began to solve things that
seemed promising he worked at slag
heat his faith in himself never wavered
after his mind had been made up

  his years upon the sea under many
climes came in good stead he found him-
self in possession of an inexhaustible store-
house of information filled with the things
the land-dwellers were burning to know
and to read about

  smiling to himself he remembered that
the check he had received only this morn-
ing from mr moore his new york agent
represented his sixteenth conquest in the
magazine field

   at arcadia street he turned the corner
in a savage gust of wind and hastened to
shelter under the wooden awnings of the
old bandini block on the top floor of
which his studio was located some of the
magazines had bought as high as from six
to eight stories from him others one or
two hardly a month passed now when
he did not add a new editor to his growing
list

   sometimes in the seclusion of his modest
den he would sit and marvel at it all for
three years he had written from daylight
until dark and often long into the hours

of the night without selling a word some-
thing like a million words stood to his
credit or discredit after those three years
his stories had gone the usual rounds with
monthly postage bills so enormous that he
was forced to forego even a fire in his
grate

  in his old shabby overcoat and his feet
wrapped in a blanket he had written writ-
ten written then suddenly one day a
short essay won the first prize in a technical
magazine in new york the ten-dollar
check he had received for this essay seemed
the open sesame to the world of literature

  down south a small southern california
magazine bought two stories the same
week at a modest price mr carson the
editor gave him to understand that down
south would be glad to buy one story a
month at the same price andrew was
jubilant

  from mr moore in new york whom
andrew had mailed some thirty short
stories a month earlier a check for seventy
dollars came also that week for two short
stories of los angeles he had broken the
ice two weeks later he won the second
prize in a short story contest of the sunday
magazine of a local daily checks began
to come regularly from new york modest
ones at first then larger ones one month
his earnings had run close to the thousand-
dollar mark he was rich beyond his wild-
est dreams

  skirting the side of the building under
the sheltering awnings andrew turned into
a columned doorway crossed a wide
cavernous expanse of brown tiled floor and
mounted the stairway by the light of its
solitary flickering gaslight

  the bandini block was one of the old
landmarks of los angeles built some
forty years earlier as an apartment hotel
when the corner of first and main streets
was a sleepy pepper-tree shaded hub of
commerce and the old plaza the civic and
social center of the little pueblo of los
angeles the building had been the standing
joke of the town bandinis folly some
wag had nicknamed it a three-storied
structure with renaissance cupolas and
roman windows it had for twenty-five
years reared its imposing pile above the
heads of the adobe dwellings about it

  during that period it had sheltered
many notables quo vadis had been
written in one of its high-ceilinged rooms

ila-v 	romance

madame mojeska had for a short period
dwelt within its hospitable walls then
suddenly the southward trend of the city
had left the old building for a period of ten
years cobwebbed and forgotten in the
center of the present latin quarter of los
angeles

  one by one men of artistic temperament
and meager means-the two things seem
to go together-found this old shell of a
building and moved in others followed
in the space of two years every room of
the top floor had been taken by devotees
of pigment letters and music the second
floor was still occupied by- a miscellaneous
aggregation of brokers latin weeklies and
job-printing establishments with a fortune-
teller or two to give variety

  andrew gaynor mounted the second
flight of stairs to the third floor and turned
the key of his studio from a half-open
doorway across the hall came the soft
tinkling of a piano pausing to shake the
water from his hat in the ill-lighted hall
andrew listened pete was playing ley-
bachs fifth nocturne it was her signal
to him that her days labor of wrestling
with pupils was over the tea-kettle he
knew was now humming away upon the
single-burner gasplate

  andrew threw his coat and hat over a
chair inside his studio closed the door and
tiptoed across the cavernous hall pausing
outside the half-open door from his vest-
pocket he pulled a small object it was a
ring-case plush-covered and dainty open-
ing the lid he stood looking thoughtfully at
a fine solitaire set in platinum gleaming
against the dark purple plush in the murky
light of the hall

  returning the ring to his pocket he
leaned his shoulder against the doorjamb
and stood looking through the half-open
door at the girl seated before the old black-
walnut piano unobserved by her in the
gloom of the hall where two flickering gas-
jets and the murky glow of the city through
the skylight above the carved staircase
only seemed to accentuate the gloom he
stood watching her as her slender fingers
wandered up and down the yellow dis-
colored keyboard

  the air the girl was playing seemed
curiously interwoven with the mood and
atmosphere of the old building andrew
stood watching her in silence now and
then he strained for a glimpse of her dark

o	the min

head as it moved out of his range of vision
with the rhythm of the music her head
was throw back slightly and her long dark
eyelashes lay like twin crescents of jet
against her clear white skin her face
with its thin aquiline nose and tapering
chin was outlined in sharp profile against
the shaded glow of a lamp behind her the
rather high cheek-bones threw a soft
shadow over the lower part of her face
and gave it a suggestion of frailness that
the proud poise of her head and her firm
white throat could not entirely dispel a
head of brown hair bobbed high above
the white sailor collar of her plain black
shirtwaist which was held together at the
throat with a heavy white cord gave the
face a certain haughtiness

  petra agostini-pete-had rented the
studio some two years earlier she was
the daughter of a poor italian foundry-
man who because of his large and ever-
increasing family had welcomed the girls
determination to shift for herself on
certain occasions agostini sr visited his
daughters studio with one or more of the
younger agostinis out at heel and elbows
tagging along to give weight to his pre-
carious financial problems after such
visits pete would dine on tea and toast for
many days

  between andrew and the girl had
sprung up a friendship built upon respect
warm mutual interest and unflinching am-
bition his evenings spent by petes grate
criticizing each encouraging and eager for
the others praise were delightful but no
moments were comparable to those when
with petes arm linked in his and the girls
light step flying to keep up with him they
tramped together over the poppy-clad hills
of garavanza

  from the day of his first meeting an-
drew had taken to her he discovered in
pete a marvelous creature who could laugh
with him over trifles sympathize with him
in his failures and spur him on to greater
endeavors when he became too serene in
the security of accomplishment he found
that he could at will awaken in her echoes
of his hopes she was a constant source
of wonder and delight to his honest primi-
tive sailor nature

  the short distance he had traveled along
the road to fame had opened to him a vista
of hitherto undreamed of things and day
bv rfnv he grew more humble and eager for

i ature
praise and encouragement with his small
success had come a certain air of convic-
tion in his bearing a deep and powerful
persuasion in his voice he could meet
men on their own ground and discuss
matters with authority the tenants of
the bandini block frightened him no
longer he had grown used to being looked
upon as a man of attainment whose advice
was worth soliciting they sought his
opinion and criticism it gave him a feel-
ing of intrinsic worth that was very grati-
fying and at the same time gave him per-
spective to keep his eyes unfalteringly upon
the road where the real giants of the earth
were traveling

  as he stood in the darkness beyond the
half-open door looking at the girls face
silhouetted against the glow of the lamp a
sudden fear that this picture of her would
vanish in air took hold of him he was
still so recent from the sea and the drab
loneliness of the sailors quarters that the
memory of sordid things was very poignant
and real

  even now he would wake up at night
from some troubled dream of his lonely
past which only the sight of his work-
table stacked to overflowing with maga-
zines containing his published stories and
the thought of pete could dispel he
would crawl back to bed with a sigh of
relief after fondling some familiar object
and lay on his back smoking and think-
ing with the sweetness of the girls per-
sonality assuaging the horrors of his dream

  he realized tonight more than ever how
necessary pete had become to him two
years earlier during the despairing hours
when the question of his next meal had
been a powerful driving force toward suc-
cess he had needed nothing more to spur
him on the very obstacles that had piled
themselves mountain-high before him had
aroused his fighting spirit to a pitch that
no barriers could exclude but now with
the creature satisfied the reaction from his
three years of suffering and sacrifice had
caused a certain bodily apathy to creep
upon him at times as when one awakens
on a cloudy day cold and depressed from
a too long sleep

  he had tried to throw himself into the
bohemian life and gaiety of the old build-
ing thinking thus to effect a cure but
after such short excursions he always re-
turned to his work frantically with a feel-

ing of having betrayed himself and lis
dream-people a visit to pete with her
warm genuine personality her unfailing
sense of intrinsic values would then put
him aright

  it is because they are not honest with
themselves pete had said one evening

 i like them but they are so frantically
trying to live up to what the world calls
bohemianism that they have lost the
sense of value and have gotten out 
touch with themselves why be a freak
because you have a talent simplicity is
the hallmark of true genius

  his wonder at her sane arguments and
clear-thinking mind never ceased the
lofty idealism of this girl that neither sor-
did home conditions nor the rebuffs of the
world had been able to shake gave an-
drew renewed hope and purposes he
began to measure the vices and virtues of
his characters by petes philosophy and
unconsciously wrote her personality into
the pages of his stories

  the girl stopped playing and turned
her head perceiving him for the first
time

  andy she exclaimed rising from the
piano-stool with both hands extended as
andrew pushed the door open and entered
you almost frightened me how long
have you been standing there why
didnt you come in

  is tea ready andrew asked sheep-
ishly like a schoolboy caught in the act
he handed her a paper sack some of
those chinese almond cookies you said you
liked i walked down to tuey far lows
and got em

  in this rain pete answered regard-
ing him with a faint flush on her cheeks
as she opened the paper sack you must
be wet pull the rocker over by the grate
while i brew the tea the water is
boiling

  andrew sat by the fire watching her as
she moved about the room the shaded
glow of the lamp on the piano threw a
soft shadow upon her face as she bent over
the tea-tray on the stand near-by he
could not see her eyes but he felt them
suffused with a soft tender light beneath
her drooping eyelids she moved forward
a step or two with the tray in her hand

  shall we move the stand over by the
fire she asked

  for a moment he sat gazing at her stand-

romance l

ing there in the half-light with the tray
poised in her slender hands and her head
thrown back she looked like a boy page
of some ancient day

  andy are you dreaming she asked
with a quick embarrassed laugh

  excuse me he said springing to his
feet and moving the stand in front of the
grate between the two chairs i guess i
was-dreaming he added avoiding her
gaze

  when she poured the tea he lifted his
eyes for an instant she was looking at
the tray not at him passing him his cup
without raising her eyes she stretched her-
self in the chair opposite with her own
cup in her lap

  well whats the score today she
asked presently

 two thousand words andrew an-
swered his eyes upon the glowing embers
and a check from the black book-for
eighty-five dollars

  good

  her face lighted instantly with en-
thusiasm for his good fortune for a mo-
ment she sipped her tea in silence then
she said-

  some day youll be a great man andy

  andrew did not answer her at once he
felt that she was thinking precisely of what
was on his own mind he glanced appre-
hensively at the bulky protuberance which
ihe ring-case made above his vest-pocket
many times he had been on the point of
asking pete to marry him but he felt that
her own success in music must be assured
before she would consent to ask her now
would be unfair in monetary reward he
had gone far beyond her he knew that
he must wait until such a time when she
could give herself fo him with a sense of
equality her pride would never allow
her to participate in his success before
her own future as an artist had been
assured

  some day youll be a great pianist
he answered presently

  she nodded

  yes

  they sat in silence with the crackling
fire and the glow of their thoughts warming
them to a sense of their importance in
cach others eyes and to the world humbly
conscious of the gifts the master had
showered in their laps proudly determined
to make the utmost of those gifts

  some day i may have to go to new
york pete said presently

  the words sent a pang through andrew
his hand grasping the saucer trembled

  of course he answered dully

  pete turned her dark eyes upon him

  the bandini block will be lonely with-
out you pete andrew added it seems
as if we should always go on working
shoulder by shoulder you and i

  he let this vision possess him as she
filled his empty cup he was never as
happy as when he surrendered himself to
dreams about pete and himself these
dreams had become interwoven with the
motive of every sentence and paragraph in
his stories if pete went to new york his
genius would depart with her

  the girl placed her empty cup on the
tray and leaned back in her chair with
her hands folded in her lap

  i have helped you then she asked
softly

  yes very-much

  you have helped me more than you
realize andy she said dropping her lids
slowly in the way he liked very few
women are blessed with a friend like you
your fairness to my sex is the result of
your years upon the sea i wonder andy
if youll ever lose this perspective of fair-
ness

  i hope not he answered

  andrew arose from his chair with the
pretext of replenishing the fire peje
reached out her arm for a piece of wood
from the box at her side as andrew took
the piece of wood from her his hand
touched hers for a brief moment his
fingers closed about hers pete sat staring
at the fire motionless without protest
andrew threw the piece of wood upon the
glowing embers in the resultant flare he
stole a glance at the girl a soft smile
lingered about her lips

  there was a long silence between them
deep quiet fell upon the room the blue
gas-flame under the tea-kettle lay flat and
still like a pool of faintly glowing phos-
phorus a cloud of tobacco smoke from
andrews pipe churned lazily and wreath-
like in the circle of light sharply defined
by the colored chinese lamp-sade the
grotesquely carved legs of the old-fashioned
piano seemed to become alive with gar-
govlish images dancing in the firelight

steam shading into gray transparency at
the edges everything about the room was
just as andrew had pictured it when he
had pushed his way against the storm an
hour earlier in his wanderings about the
seas he had thought of such a scene as this
seated with his dream-girl before their
glowing grate with a good days work
accomplished   

  there was steps outside in the hall fol-
lowed by a knock john devor entered
and closed the door behind him

  hello folks he said throwing his rain-
coat over the back of a chair and advanc-
ing to the glowing grate rubbing his wet
steaming hands please sit still he
added dropping to a seat on the wood-box
beside pete refusing the chair andrew
pushed forward id much rather sit
where i am you cant get close enough
to a fire on a night like this

  he glanced from pete who had risen
and was pouring him a cup of tea to
andrews face

  whats happened he asked in mock
seriousness you both look like you had
lost your last friend or-dollar

  the girl passed him his cup with a quiet
smile

  hows your cough john she asked
ignoring his question

a shadow passed momentarily over
devors face he stirred his tea thought-
fully before replying then with a pa-
thetic smile on his thin lips he replied
fine its growing into a real mans
size cough even the landlady is begin-
ning to take notice she hinted this morn-
ing that she might have to increase my
room-rent tourist season and so forth
she said doctor bayless gave me six
months to live bless his generous heart
pete shot andrew a scared glance
why dont you chuck everything and
go camping in the mountains john
andrew inquired

  hm devor answered in the spring

i	shall perhaps at present im having
rather a good time analyzing the progress
of slow dissolution its good copy and
fascinating some day i hope to write a
book about the last moments of a con-
sumptive if i happen to pass out before
the book is finished youll find half a
ream of notes on the subject in the top
shelf of my bookcase andrew its hot
stuff

  john pete exclaimed in horrof
devor placed his hand on the girls arm
with a motion of apology

  forgive me pete he said contritely
i didnt mean to be a boor i guess this
thing is beginning to get on my nerves 
have always been so confoundedly healthy
you know

  you mustnt talk like that john

  he continued with vehemence

  for six years i have struggled and
fought just when success is within my
grasp this thing comes along he
drained his cup to the dregs and placed
the empty cup on the stand its a great
life if you dont weaken he whispered
with a slow smile

  when devor had gone to his studio
andrew rose and stretched his legs before
the fire

  poor john he murmured

  pete was busy putting the tea things
away in the far end of the room she did
not answer at once then crossing the
floor to andrews side she held her hands
over the grate and said-

  i think john is broke andy

  andrew started and grasped her by the
shoulders

  good god he exclaimed it never
struck me for a moment why-why
didnt he say something

  john is proud pete answered softly
something he said yesterday started me
to thinking didnt you notice his watch
was gone i think john is in a bad way
instinctively andrew ran his finger into
his own vest-pocket it came in contact
with the plush-covered ring-case petes
eyes followed his finger

  whats that lump she asked inno-
cently

  for a moment andrew was at a loss
what to say then looking into her dark
eyes he saw that she was half-suspecting
what the pocket contained he blushed
furiously pulling the ring-case from the
pocket he placed it in her hand and
watched her breathlessly open it

  andy she exclaimed

  he took the ring from her hand and
placed it on her finger as he did so the
case dropped to the floor and rolled under
the rocking chair pete raised her face to
his andrew took her burning cheeks be-
tween his hands and kissed her for a
moment she clung to him shyly he laid

 romance l gglj 

his lips upon her hair that was soft and
fragrant like mosses on the warm slopes
of the canons

  i-i-was afraid to ask you he whis-
pered you seemed so-wrapped up in
your career pete

  andy she laughed softly love was
all i needed to make my success sure and
love itself is the greatest career in the
world

  he smoothed the hair from her fore-
head with trembling ecstatic fingers it
seemed to andrew that the world was a
great chamber filled to bursting with ex-
quisite music that any moment might rend
it asunder and scatter its sweet-toned won-
der over the universe

  there was a knock on the door the
two lovers flew apart

  come in andrew said with a new
authority in his voice

  john devor entered he gazed curi-
ously from one to the other

  i dropped my note-book somewhere
he said glancing about the floor in front
of the grate

  pete lifted the lamp from the stand and
helped him search moving the rocking-
chair devor dropped to his knees and dis-
covering the ring-case where it had rolled
under the chair held it up to the light and
examined it andrew and pete exchanged
meaning glances devor opened the ring-
case with an odd expression on his face
his glance fell upon petes face suffused
with a telltale flush and traveled slowly
to her hand grasping the lamp upon whose
finger the solitaire sparkled in the soft
light his face turned the color of chalk
rising to his feet he placed the ring-case
dazedly upon the mantle for a moment
he stood swaying in the uncertain light
then he ran his hand over his eyes as if
to brush away some unpleasant vision and
drew a deep breath

  i guess i must have dropped-the note-
book in the hall he stammered youll
excuse me for bothering you

  he crossed the floor unsteadily at the
door he paused with his thin bony hand
clutching the knob convulsively

  good night and-good luck to both of
you he said with white lips

  the next moment the door closed upon
him pete replaced the lamp on the stand
when she joined andrew at the grate there
was tears in her eyes

  poor old john andrew whispered
weve both been blind pete

  he bent low and kissed her

  good night pete he said gently tak-
ing her slim hand in his own and holding
it up to the firelight in the soft glow
the diamond sparkled and leaped as a
thing alive pete pressed the ring to her
lips and looked at andrew in silent adora-
tion

  good night andy she said softly

  andrew crossed the dim-lighted hall to
his studio as in a dream beneath his new
found happiness smoldered the thought of
john devor his friend fighting a losing
battle with the white specter in his lonely
tower studio down the hall

ii

the next day when andrew went to
lunch he met agostini sr coming
down the stairs a wave of resentment
and disgust swept over andrew as he
glanced at the wrinkled scowling face of
the old italian foundry-man pete had
been bled again no one knew better than
he himself how ill she could afford it

  motioning to the man he drew him into
the sheltering darkness of the stairway
old agostinis face turned white with guilt

  what you want he growled drawing
back

    andrew drew forth a roll of small
bills and counted twenty dollars into the
astonished mans hand

  when you need money again come to
me he said understand you are not
to bother pete any more

  i-understand the old man grinned
favoring andrew with a knowing wink

  i dont think you do-quite andrew
retorted clenching his fists meaningly

  the man shrank back coweringly
stuffing the bills into his greasy pocket

  miss agostini must know nothing about
this you may tell her that your wages
have been raised or anything you choose
once a month i will meet you at an ap-
pointed place with a like amount on the
condition that you do not breathe a word
about this to your daughter understand
as much as a hint and the allowance stops
good-by

  when andrew mounted the stairs and
unlocked his door half an hour later he
saw tohn devor come out of petes studio

j io

the miniature
r o m ance

close the door softly behind him and walk
on tiptoe down the deserted hall to his
tower room above at the foot of the
narrow staircase which led to the tower
devor paused for a moment and stood
gazing at a small dark object in his out-
stretched palm the rays of the winter
sun fell yellow and wan through the sky-
light above his head upon his gaunt sunken
face

  andrew saw him bend over the object
in his hand for a moment then with his
head sunk on his chest devor mounted
the narrow staircase out of sight andrew
stood rooted to the spot what was devor
doing in petes studio the girl was ab-
sent he knew at this hour andrew had
recognized the object in his friends hand
it was the purple plush ring-case he
wanted to run after devor but something
restrained him opening the door of his
studio he flung himself upon the lounge
and buried his face in his hands

   with the door ajar he watched for petes
return resolving to say nothing about the
incident she would think the empty case
had been swept out by the janitor during
her absence she came in an hour later
than usual as she stepped upon the land-
ing outside her door andrew took the
key from her hand and opened the door
her face was flushed with the exertion of
the two flights of stairs and when he closed
the door behind them and took her in his
arms he felt her heart beating close to
his own in their embrace she removed
her hat and gloves while he stood watching
her out of his eager happy eyes glancing
at her gloveless hand he asked-

   where is the ring pete

   oh she replied i couldnt bear to
have other people share in my happiness-
yet i left it there in the case on the
mantle-why-where she crossed the
floor to the mantle with a cry of horror
andy she gasped are you playing a
joke on me

  andrew stood staring at the smooth
empty expanse of the mantle-shelf

   you-left-it in the plush case-on the
-mantle he asked dazedly

   yes yes she cried oh andy some
one must have stolen it

   for a moment andrew stood speechless
staring from the mantle to the girls tear-
ful face

   oh my god he blurted out

  the horrible situation burst upon him
in a flash the plush ring-case in devors
hand as he mounted the stairs to his
studio it was perfectly plain his
friends financial condition had caused him
to commit a theft

  has anyone besides john and myself
got the key to this room he asked
hoarsely

  only the janitor and my father pete
quavered i would trust either of those
three she sank into a chair and buried
her face in her hands oh what must
you think of me andy she sobbed

  andrew took her in his arms

   never mind sweetheart he whispered
itll turn up sure dont worry leave
it to me

  just before dusk andrew walked with a
heavy heart up the creaking stairs to
devors tower room on the roof of the
building for an hour he had been re-
hearsing over and over again what to say
to john he had decided to drop no hint
about the loss of the ring for the present
in some way he must contrive to force
john to accept a loan so that his unfortu-
nate friend would be enabled to return the
ring at first a wave of resentment and
horror had swept over andrew at johns
betrayal of his faith in him but upon
maturer consideration the resentment gave
place to a feeling of great pity and toler-
ance he placed himself in johns position
and shuddered the temptation of starva-
tion he knew only too well after all
what was the price of a paltry ring with
a human life at stake the ring with its
one-carat gem spelled two months of
leisure in the mountains for john-two
months longer lease of life for his sick
friend andrew shuddered for himself
were he placed in such a position

  when he knocked at the door of the
tower room he heard devor spring to his
feet

  who is there

  its andy john andrew answered
with beating heart

  just a moment andy

  andrew heard devor close a drawer
then footsteps across the floor the next
moment the bolt was withdrawn and john
in his smoking-jacket opened the door

  i was doing some special work so i
shot the bolt devor explained pointing
to a chair sit down andy

 romance	-

  andrew glanced about the room never
before today had it struck him how poorly
this tower room was furnished he had
always thought of the place with its half-
finished sketches in oil and pastel as a
workshop now he saw it for the first
time as the only home john had ever
known the ragged couch-cover the crazy
chairs the table littered with tubes of
paint worn-out brushes and crayons were
eloquent of his friends reduced circum-
stances

  for several moments he sat with parched
lips avoiding johns gaze he was at a
loss how to begin he could not come
right out and offer his friend assistance
devor was standing with his back to him
looking out of the window across the roofs
of the buildings andrews gaze wandered
about the room suddenly a thought
occurred to him

  john he said with as much calm as
he could muster pointing to a painting
of a young girl near the window what
will you take for that picture

  devor turned upon him slowly with a
cynical smile on his thin lips

  dont kid me he said

  i am in earnest john how much will
you take spot cash

  ye gods john whispered my first
sale steady boy how much shall i
stick the gentleman he looks good for
ten dollars shall i wrap it up or do you
wish it delivered sir

  andrew drew out his check-book with
trembling hands

  give me a pen he said

  he tore off the check and handed it to
devor

  ive okd the signature you can get
it cashed at any bank

  devor stood staring at the piece of pa-
per dazedly

  fifty dollars he murmured andy

i refuse to allow you to-

  give me the picture before you change
your mind andrew said sternly the
transaction is closed

  devor took the painting from the wall
and handed it to andrew his face was
flushed with a mixture of embarrassment
and gratitude when andrew paused in
the open door with the picture under his
arm john held out his hand and said
huskily-	

  i shant forget andy

  for a moment andy looked his friend
straight in the face johns eyes never
wavered andrew felt the guilty flush of
suspicion unwarranted mount to his own
cheeks

  good-by he said closing the door
softly and descending the stairs

  pete was waiting for him in his studio
when andrew entered with the picture
under his arm

  i-i-think i have a clue to the loss
of the ring he said avoiding her gaze
get your hat and coat and let us go to a
play and try to forget about the ring
everything will be all right

  the girl glanced at the picture and
caught her hand at her throat

  andy she whispered looking him
straight in the eyes

  andrew dropped his eyes in confusion

  please get your hat and coat and let
us be going he said almost gruffly

  all right andy the girl whispered
humbly leaving the room

iii

when the door closed upon andrew
devor stood gazing silently at the
check in his hand crossing the room lie
drew from his pocket a small key with
which he opened the top drawer of his
dresser

  with trembling hands he took from the
drawer the small purple ring-case and
pressed the spring and smiled softly the
night before he had remdved the inside
padding and had fitted in its place a small
miniature painting of pete which he had
begun shortly after midnight and had jus
finished when andrew had knocked he
had intended to replace the ring-case on
the mantle before petes return from her
afternoon pupils as a surprize for the girl
but andrews visit had upset this plan

  changing his smoking-jacket for a gray
norfolk he folded up andrews check
stuck it in his vest-pocket placed the ring-
case with its miniature painting open on
the table that the paint might dry quickly
and left the studio locking the door be-
hind him

  after cashing the check at andrews
bank he called on rubinstein the pawn-
broker to redeem his watch on which he
had borrowed ten dollars a few days
earlier

r o m ance

  rubinstein was busy with a customer at
the far end of the store so devor sauntered
about the place looking at the showcases
his attention was attracted to the wicket
gate in front of the safe by the excited
voice of rubinsteins customer and the
pawnbrokers insistent refusal of some
request

  glancing up curiously devor saw the
owner of the excited voice a short dark-
complexioned man stuff a handful of soiled
bills into his trousers pocket there was
something familiar about the man devor
turned his back upon the two men as
the customer came shambling down be-
tween the showcases as the man passed
into the street devor got a glimpse of a
swarthy familiar face old agostini
petes father he wondered what article
the old impecunious italian had possessed
to charm money from the flinty rubin-
stein the family crucifix perhaps

   devor was aroused from his speculations
by rubinstein tapping his shoulder

   vat can i do for you mister dee-vor
the pawnbroker inquired rubbing his
hands genially

  oh-er my watch i came to redeem
it devor answered

  so soon eh goot business rubin-
stein grinned come with me back

  devor followed the pawnbroker to the
counter before the safe at the rear of the
store where the nucleus of rubinsteins
business rested securely behind a row of
strong iron bars the pawnbroker stooped
down and pulled out a drawer from which
he selected an envelope with devors name
upon it

  ten-forty mister deevor ten dol-
lars principal und forty cents interest i
must charge you full month four per
cent he sighed as if apologizing for his
usury

  very well devor answered as the
pawnbroker wound up the watch obligingly
while the money was being counted out
pushing the brlls across the counter to
rubinstein devor asked casually-what
did old agostini have to pawn

  the pawnbroker grinned

  you know him he asked

   slightly devor answered

  a ring rubinstein volunteered a
damn fine ring he reached into the open
safe behind him look some class eh
-lister deevor

  devor stared speechless with amazement
at the ring between the pawnbrokers
gnarled fingers there could be no mis-
take about it it was the ring he had
seen on petes finger the night before the
design was a peculiar one of andrews own
idea devor took the ring between his
fingers and exaipinecl it on the inside
was engraved the word pete

  he suddenly remembered having seen
old agostini in the hall outside petes
studio about noon the whole thing was
perfectly plain the old italian had vis-
ited petes room in the girls absence
devor knew that the man had the key to
his daughters studio he had taken the
ring from its case on the mantle-robbed
his own daughter

  devor handed the ring back to the
pawnbroker

  how much did he borrow on it he
asked casually

  forty dollars rubinstein answered
he wants fifty he got mad you heard
him

  devor laughed softly

  you old robber he grinned its
worth a hundred and fifty if its worth a
cent

  sure i know rubinstein answered
retail wholesale about seventy-five i
lend fifty per cent wholesale value only
i gotter live

   youll never die of heart failure rubin-
stein devor said thoughtfully where
does agostini live have you got his
address	

  sure the pawnbroker answered you

rubinstein grinned i bet you she right
away send for the preacher maybe one
carat full-oi oi i bet she get tickled
no

will you turn over the ring to me on pay-
ment of the forty dollars with interest

cent-dollar sixty- and the ring

  rubinstein consulted his pawn record

  rubinstein passed devor back his ten
dollars with a grin

rubinstein devor said slong

the home of agostini on palmetto
street was an old adobe hovel set
back from the street in a wilderness of
broken-down fences woodpiles and the
overflow of a second-hand machinery con-
cern whose yard piled high with rusted
cogwheels and scrap-iron of every descrip-
tion surrounded it on three sides

  once a farm-house when the city was
young it now stood in the center of that
mongrel demesne east of main street
which is neither resident nor factory dis-
trict a place given over without lease or
privileges to the poorest classes of the
workers white black and yellow lived
here side by side in amiable squalor it
was a place of curs garlic and settlement
schools women perennially big with
child heavy-footed men with lack-luster
eyes children hoary in the vices of youth

  devor picked his way shudderingly down
the littered unswept sidewalk out of this
seraglio pete had stepped marvelous and
bright-eyed to demand from the world a
place for her ideals

  in response to his knock the door was
opened by a slatternly woman with dark
eyes like petes-turned heavy lidded and
weary with hopes deferred from the room
at her back beyond the open door came
the fretful bickering of alien child tongues

  what you want the women inquired
of devor shouting a shrill warning in
italian over her shoulder to the children

  is mr agostini at home devor
asked removing his hat

  the woman regarded him searehingly in
the smoke-churned gloom of the hall

  what you want with him she re-
peated ungraciously

  my name is john devor i am a friend
of your daughter petra may i speak to
your husband

  mrs agostinis weary eyes lit up with
momentary interest

  a friend of petes she asked there
was a sudden change in her attitude and

tone is she with trouble will you not
come in my husband is at home yes but
he-is-not very well tonight was pay-
night she added by the way of explana-
tion

  devor nodded and followed her through
the hall into a large room that served as
kitchen sitting-room laundry and nursery
wiping a litter of crumbs from a chair
with her apron she bade him be seated
and went into the adjoining room four
young agostinis in various stages of un-
dress stared at devor across the littered
supper-table the latest arrival scarcely
a year old regarded him solemnly from a
battered high-chair by the stove dividing
its attention impartially between devor
and a crust of bread in its grubby fist

  from the adjoining room devor heard
the muffled voice of mrs agostini exhort-
ing her husband iu italian to get up pres-
ently she returned

  hell be out in a minute she volun-
teered turning her back upon devor
hows pete there aint nothing bad
has happened is there

  oh no devor answered reassuringly
i just came to- he paused

  in the open doorway stood agostini
stubby-bearded unkempt blinking his
watery eyes one suspender dangling at his
waist

  what you want he growled scowling
at devor across the littered table

  my name is john devor devor said
steadily extending his hand im a friend
of your daughter petra may i speak with
you in private

  agostini ignored the salutation and
fastened his small beady eyes furtively
upon devors face his liquor-inflamed
cheeks turned a sickly green

  what you want he spluttered with a
show of bravado

  i would rather discuss the matter with
you in private devor answered pointedly

  all right agostini answered ungra-
ciously come in here

  well he growled shutting the door
behind him and facing devor with a men-
acing frown

  devor looked the man steadily in the
eyes for a moment

  i want you to give me the pawn-ticket
agostini he said quietly

  you go to hell the italian shouted

i id

the miniature
  i will give you just one minute to pro-
duce the pawn-ticket devor said

  youre ver-ry kind meester devor
agostini retorted with a drunken leer

  agostini devor said i saw you come
out of your daughters studio today and
rubinstein gave me your address i have
two plainclothes-men waiting down the
street come now dont be a fool

  the old italians face became livid with
fear

  i-i spent the money my children
need clothes he whined hypocritically

  i didnt ask you for the money devor
said contemptuously all i want is the
pawn-ticket

  oh the man growled in evident relief
he ran his hand into the pocket of his
overalls and threw a folded piece of paper
on the soiled bed-cover take it

  devor stuck the piece of paper in his
pocket and left the man sitting on the edge
of the bed muttering drunkenly mrs
agostini with the baby in her arms looked
up inquiringly as devor came out of the
bedroom

  may i speak to you a moment devor
asked motioning her outside

  pete sent you this he said pressing a
five-dollar bill into her hand better not
let your husband know he added

  mrs agostini caught his hand impuls-
ively

  tell pete hello from me she whis-
pered maybe some day i come see her
only i think she ashamed of me

v

when he stepped off the street-car at
the corner of second and main
streets devor found to his dismay that
rubinstein had closed his shop he rattled
the handle of the door without getting
any response for a moment he stood in
indecision looking up and down the almost
deserted street and clutching the pawn-
ticket nervously in his hand there was
nothing to do but wait until morning

  crossing into spring street he bought
himself something to eat at a lunch-
counter he was faint from hunger and
from the reaction after his stormy inter-
view with old agostini the sleepy-eyed
waiter took his order with an air of per-
sonal resentment devor ate his sandwich
ravenously gulped down a cup of beastly

coffee and rose to his feet unsteadily the
atmosphere of the place nauseated him
he threw the amount of his check on the
greasy counter and staggered into the
street in a violent fit of coughing lean-
ing against a lamppost for support he
turned up the collar of his threadbare
norfqlk then continued his way unsteadily
north on main to the studio

  at temple block he paused in another
violent fit of coughing and sank exhausted
to a seat on the granite steps of the fed-
eral building the street lay wet and
glistening wrapped in gray clammy fog
punctuated by flickering arclights a
sharp penetrating wind stole down the
narrow chasm of temple street chilling
him to the bone hugging the granite ped-
estal of the bronze-armed lamp-post he
placed his fevered forehead against the
icy metal

   for a long time he sat very still with
his hands at his throbbing temples think-
ing thinking thinking early in the morn-
ing he would go to rubinsteins and redeem
the ring he would save pete from the
disgrace of knowing that her own father
was a thief returning the ring to her with
the case containing the miniature he could
explain that he had only borrowed the
ring-case for the purpose of painting the
picture and that he had not discovered
that the ring was inside until he had opened
it in the morning to fit the miniature into
it she would believe him implicitly pete
was that kind devor smiled softly
andrews check had saved the situation
little would his old friend suspect the
reward his generosity had reaped

   rising shiveringly he staggered north
on main street through the fog familiar
objects stood outlined in vague blurs on
every hand pedestrians with hunched
shoulders and upturned coat collars rose
out of the fog passed him and were lost
to sight a moment later he seemed to
be groping his way through a universe
filled with noxious strangling fumes whose
denizens were automatons gasping and
coughing he felt his way along the wall
under the columned gloom of the bandini
blocks marquis-shrouded sidewalk and
found the entrance clutching the ban-
ister he dragged himself up the two
flights of stairs with the pawn-ticket in his
hand and staggered down the hall to his
tower studio

by carl clausen	n
  when he inserted the key he was aston-
ished to feel the door open at his touch
for a moment he stood swaying in the
light of the open door blinking his eyes
dazedly beside the table in the middle
of the room stood pete and andrew on
the table in the pool of light from the
shaded reading-lamp lay the purple ring-
case with petes miniature where he had
left it to dry horror-struck devor stood
staring from one to the other andrews
gaze was bent accusingly upon him pete
turned her back upon him and buried her
face in her hands something within
devors brain seemed to snap he stag-
gered across the threshold the pawn-
ticket fluttered from his hand he felt
andrews arm encircle his waist the
room turned black before his eyes

  the chill winter sun fell through the
arched windows above his couch devor
turned his head upon his pillow wearily

  pete he gasped

  the girl raised her head from her task
of stirring something in a water tumbler-
on a stand near his head

  yes john she said softly bending
over him and pressing the glass to his
lips

  devor stared at her hand holding the
glass encircling the girls finger was the
stolen ring rising upon his eibow he ran
his hand over his eyes

  pete - where - how - did you get -

that-

  pete replaced the glass on the stand
oh john she sobbed dropping to her
knees beside him we took the pawn-
ticket to rubinsteins this morning and re-
deemed the ring you dropped the ticket
on the floor when you fainted last night
rubinstein told us everything she
pressed devors thin emaciated fingers to
her lips oh john john she whispered
can you ever forgive us

  the door opened andrew entered with
a tray which he placed on the table and
with both hands extended came swiftly
to devors bedside

  john he said huskily averting his
face and grasping his sick friends thin
hands in a grip of steel

  devor closed his eyes

  how do you like-the miniature
pete he whispered

  like it she whispered back words
can not express john it is the work

of a master-

  yes yes he murmured with a smile
on his thin bloodless lips the master-
painted - your - picture on - my heart
pete- he rose on his pillow and took
her face between his hands pete he
gasped look at me straight in the
eyes i am-taking-your picture-back
with me-to-the master--

a five-part story
part ii

 the first part of the story briefly retold in story form

 ktothiv dont nuver come ter pas hyar-

  in about boone wellver lamented aloud
to the cumberlands

  came a rustling and victor mccalloway with
saber rode up

son said mccalloway im bound for cyrus
spradlings house does your father live near

  haint got no daddy no mammy nuther asa
gregorys my first cousin i reckon you know
him

  yes replied the man who had read about
gregorys indictment for the murder of john
carr

  at this juncture asa strode up and volunteered
to accompany mccalloway to the latters des-
tination while on the way asa told the man
he had killed carr in self-defense

bitter was the party feeling in the election
for governor of kentucky in q marlin
town a mountain community was republican
despite the hatred of the mountaineers william
goebel the democratic candidate spoke at the
town asa and boone were present

  later saul fulton who had left the backwoods
to live as a tenant on a bluegrass farm visited
his cousin asa

  there is ter be a rally at ther incline ter-
night he explained an they wants me ter
fotch ye back-an thet ye shant tote no wecpin
of airy sort your enemy tom carr  be there
unarmed ef ye an tom shakes hands all will
ride home quiet an take off thar coats ter beat
goebel for governor

  that night asa and carr shook hands pledg-
ing to lay aside feudism for the time being for
the sake of political harmony

after the speaking boone went to mccallo-

ways home where he met general basil prince
the two men talked late prince praising the
british general sir hector dinwiddie who slan-
dered had taken his life in paris

  when prince had finished mccalloway held
out his saber

  this is dinwiddies sword he explained
and he trusted me enough to leave it in my
keeping

winter came and the election both sides
claimed the narrow margin of victory and
the fight was taken to the courts in december
fulton and boone drove a herd of cattle to mar-
ket and on the twelfth the boy saw the inaugura-
tion of the republican governor

  fulton and boone lived in a frame house back
of the country home of colonel tom wallifarro
a christmas-eve reception was held and boone
went thinking the affair was similar to the
parties held in the mountains

  i hecred tell thet thar was a dancing party
goin forward hyar he announced as he opened
the door an i lowed id jest fare over fer a
spell

  an outburst of laughter greeted him

  general prince who was present introduced
boone

  i fear ive done made a fool o myself an
i reckon ill say farewell to you-all he re-
marked

  this is my party spoke up little anne
masters and i invite you to come in

a visitor called on fulton one night dur-
ing the first week in february and made
arrangements for saul and jim hollins of clay
county and representatives of other counties

-	
to inducc armed mountaineers to go to frank-
fort to petition the legislature

   shortly afterward bev jett sheriff of marlin
county advised asa gregory to go to frankfort
to try to secure a pardon

  when on the twenty-fifth of january he
visited frankfort to attend a political conference
colonel wallifarro saw a train arrive filled with
mountaineers he heard the cry-

  the mountaineers have come

ix

when the senate convened that
day strange and uncouth
lookers-on stood ranged about
the statehouse corridors and
their unblinking eyes took stony account
of their chief adversary as he entered

  upon his dark face with its overhang-
ing forelock flickered no ghost of misgiv-
ing no hint of any weakening or excite-
ment his gaze betrayed no interest be-
yond the casual for the men along the
walls whom report credited with a mur-
derous hatred of himself

  boone was fretting his heart out at the
cabin of saul fulton while he knew that
history was in the making at frankfort
and on the evening of the twenty-ninth
an eagerness to be near the focus of
activity mastered him the elements of
right and wrong involved in this battle
of political giants were to his untrained
mind academic but the drama of con-
flict was like a bugle-call-clear direct
and urgent

  he would not be immediately needed on
the farm and frankfort was only fifteen
miles away if he set out at once and
walked most of the night he could reach
the mecca of his pilgrimage by tomor-
row morning and in his pocket was the
sum of two-bits to defray the expenses
of snacks an sich-like needcessities

  for the avoidance of possible discus-
sion he slipped quietly out of the back
door with no announcement to sauls wife
with soft snowflakes drifting into his
face and melting on his eyelashes he began
his march and for four hours swung along
at a steady three-and-a-half-mile gait at
last he stole into a barn and huddled down
upon a straw pile but before dawn he was
on the way again and in the early light
he turned into the main street of the
state capital his purpose was to view
one day of life in a city and then to slip
back again to his uneventful duties

  the town had outgrown its first indig-
nant surprize over the invasion of the

mountain army and the senator from
kenton had passed boldly through its un-
ordered ranks as need suggested the
hillmen had fallen sullenly back and made
a path for his going

  this morning he walked with a close
friend who had constituted himself a
bodyguard of one the upper house was
tc meet at ten and it was five minutes short
of the hour when the man with preoccupied
and resolute features swung through the
gate of the statehouse grounds the way
lay from there around the fountain to the
door set within the columned portico

  in circling the fountain the companion
dropped a pace to the rear and glanced
about him with a hasty scrutiny and as he
did so a sharp report ripped the quietness
of the place speedily followed by the more
muffled sound of pistol shots

  the gentleman in the rear froze in his
tracks glancing this way and that in a
bewildered effort to locate the sound the
senator halted too but after a moment
he wavered a little lifted one hand with
a gesture rather of weariness than of pain
and buckling at the knees sagged down
slowly until he lay on the flag-stoned walk
with one hand pr ssed to the bosom of his
buttoned overcoat

  figures were already running up from
here and there as the dismayed friend
locked his arms under the prone shoulders
he heard words faintly enunciated-not
dramatically declaimed but in strangely
matter-of-fact tone and measure

  i guess theyve-got me

  boone wellver saw a throng of tight-
wedged humanity pressing along with eyes
turned inward toward some core of ex-
cited interest and heard the words that
ran everywhere-goebel has been shot
he felt a sudden nausea as he followed
the crowd at whose center was borne a
helpless body until it jammed about the
door of a doctors office and after that
for a long while he wandered absently
over the town

  turning the corner of an empty side
street in the late afternoon he came face

the tempering
	rom

to face with asa gregory and iiis per-
plexed unrest gave way to comfort

   asa was tranquilly studying a theatrical
poster displayed on a wall his face was
composed and lit with a smile of quiet
amusement but before boone reached his
side or accosted him another figure
rounded the corner walking with agitated
haste and the boy ducked hastily back
recognizing saul fulton who might tax
him with truancy

  yet when he saw sauls almost insanely
excited gaze meet asas quiet eyes curi-
osity overcame caution and he came boldly
forward

  yed better not tarry in town over-
long asa saul was advising in the high
voice of alarm im dismayed ter find
ye hyar now

  why be ye demanded asa and his
unruffled utterance was velvet-smooth
haint i got a license ter go wharsoever
hit pleasures me

  this haint no safe time ner place fer
us mountain fellers came the anxiety-
freighted reply an youve done been
writ up too much in ther newspapers
a-ready youve got a lawless repute an
alter this mornin frarkfort-town haint no
safe place fer ye

  i come down hyar announced asa
still with an imperturbable suavity ter
try an git me a pardon i haint got hit
yit an thar-fore i haint ready ter turn
away

  gregory began a deliberate ransacking
of his pockets in search of his tobacco
plug and in doing so he hauled out mis-
cellaneous odds and ends before he found
what he was seeking

   in his hands materialized a corncob pipe
some loose coins and matches and then
-as sauls voice broke into frightened ex-
clamation-several rifle and pistol cart-
ridges

  good god man exploded the other
mountaineer aint ye got no more com-
mon sense then ter be totin them things
round in this town-terday

  asa raised his brows and smiled in-
dulgently upon his kinsman

   why ginrally ive got a few catridges
and pistol hulls in mv pockets he
drawled why shouldnt i

wen git rid of em an be speedy about
dont ye know full well thet every
mountain man in towns goin ter be sus-

picioned an thet ther legislaterll vote
more money then ye ever dreamed of to
stretch mountain necks give them
things ter the boy thar

  fulton had not had time to feel sur-
prize at seeing boone whom he had left
on the farm confronting him here on the
sidewalk of a frankfort street now as
the boy reached up his hand and asv
carelessly dropped the cartridges into it
saul rushed vehemently on

  boone dont make no mention of this
hyar talk ter nobody take yore foot
in yore hand an light out fer my hous 
-an ther fust srring-branch ye comes
ter stop an fling them things inter ther
water

  when the wires gave to the world the
appalling climax of that savagely acrimo-
nious campaign a breathlessness of shock
settled upon the state where passion had
run its inflammatory course the reitera-
tion of cassandras prediction had failed to
discount the staggering reality and for a
brief moment animosities were silenced

  but that was not for long yesterday
the lieutenants of an iron-strong leader
had bowed to his dominant will today
they stood dedicated to reprisal behind a
martyr-exalted by his mortal hurt

  it appeared certain that the rifle had
barked from a window of the executive
building itself and when police and
posses hastily summoned had hurried to
its doors a grimly unyielding cordon of
mountaineers had spelled in human type
the words no admission

  the secretary of state who was a moun-
tain man was among the first to fall under
accusation and had the citys police offi-
cers been able to seize the governor he
too would doubtless have been thrown
into a cell but the governor still held
the disputed credentials of office and he
sat at his desk haggard of feature yet at
bay and momentarily secure behind a
circle of bayonets

  just wrath would not and could not
long remain only righteous indignation
out of its inflammation would spring a
hundred injustices and so in opposition to
the mounting clamor for extreme penalties
arose thundering the couqter-voice of pro-
test against a swift and ruthless sacrifice
of conspicuous scapegoats

  to the aid of those first caught in the
dragnet of vengeful accusation came a

handful of volunteer defense attorneys and
among them was colonel wallifarro

  the leader with the bullet-pierced breast
was dying and in the legislature the con-
test must be settled if at all while there
was yet strength enough in his ebbing life
currents to take the oath of office

  his last fight was in keeping with his
life-the persistence of sheer resolution
that held death in abeyance and refused
surrender

  but when the democratic majority of
the assembly gathered at their chambers
they encountered muskets when casting
dignity to the snowy winds they raced
toward an opera house the soldiers raced
with them and arrived first when they
doubled like pursued hares toward the odd
fellows hall they found its door like-
wise barred by blade and muzzle

  among the first men thrown into jail
were saul fulton and his friend hollins
of clay county their connection with
the arrival of the mountaineers was not
difficult to establish-and for the officers
charged with ferreting out the ugly re-
sponsibility it made a plausible beginning

  meanwhile the majority legislature
thwarted of open meeting caucussed in
hotel bedrooms and gave decision for the
dying candidate a hectic and grotesque
rumor even whispered that mr goe-
bels gallant hold on life had slipped be-
fore the credentials could be placed in
his weakened hand-and that the oath
was solemnly administered to a dead
body

  boone had gone back to sauls farm-
house and on the way he had tossed
the cartridges into a brook that flowed
along the road but his brain was in a
swirl of perplexity and in his blood was
an innoculation he would never know
content again unless in the theater of
public affairs he might be an onlooker
or an actor

x

a few days after that boone started
back again to his mountains with
saul in jail and his wife returning to her
people there was nothing further to hold
him here indeed he was anxious now to get
home like one who has been bewildered
by a plethora of new experiences he
needed time to digest them and above

all he wanted to talk with victor mccallo-
way whose wisdom was to his thinking
as that of a second solomon there too
was his other hero asa who had returned
to the hills as quietly as he had left them
boone was burning to know whether in
the whirlpool of excitement there at frank-
fort his efforts to secure executive clem-
ency had met with success or failure

  when immediately upon crossing cedar
mountain he presented himself at mc-
calloways house he was somewhat non-
plussed at the grave almost accusing eyes
which the hermit gentleman bent upon
him

  ive jest got back hyar from ther big
world down below announced the boy
an i fared straight over hyar ter see ye
fust thing he paused a little crest-
fallen to note that reserve of silence where
he had anticipated a warmth of welcome
and then he went on shyly thar was
hell ter pay down thar at frankfort town
an i seed a good part of ther bilin with
my own eyes

  very slowly victor mccalloway made
response

  you have witnessed a tragedy-a crime
for which the guilty parties should pay
with their lives even then a scar will
be left on the honor of your state

  boone crowd- d his hands into his coat-
pockets and shivered in the wet wind for
as yet he had not been invited across the
threshold

  i dont know nothin about who done
hit he made calm assertion but fel-
lers like saul fulton peared ter low he
plum needed killin

  fellows like saul fulton

  the retired soldier drew a long breath
and his eyes narrowed

  you went down there boone with a
kinsman who now stands accused of com-
plicity the law presumes his innocence
until it proves him guilty but im not
thinking of him much just now im
thinking of you he paused as if in
deep anxiety then added a boy may be
led by reckless and wilful men into-well
-grave mistakes i believe in you but
you must answer me one question and you
must answer it on your word of honor-
as a gentleman

  the boys pupils widened interrogatively
and held those older eyes with an un-
faltering steadiness in their frank and

i zo

the tempering
romance

skfestioi

engaging depths of blue as open as the
sky victor mccalloway read the answer
to his question and something like a sigh
of relief shook him-something spasmodic
that clutched at his throat and his well-
seasoned reserve

  he had dreaded that boone in that fa-
natically bitter association might have
brushed shoulders with some guilty knowl-
edge he had refused that fear lodgment
in his thoughts as an ungenerous suspicion
but a lurking realization had persisted it
might need only a short lapse from a new
concept to an inherited and ancient code
to make heroes of killers for this strip-
ling

  slowly and candidly the boy spoke

  on my word of honor as a gentle-
man-

  his utterance hung hesitantly on that
final word it was a new thought that it
might be applicable to himself yet this
man was a better and more exacting judge
of its meaning than he and his heart
leaped to the quickened tempo of a new
pride

  i dont know nothin-save thet i
heered hit named aforehand thet men war
a cornin from ther mountings ter see
justice done an didnt aim ter be gain-
said ner thwarted i lowed though hit
would come about in far fight-ef so be
hit bred trouble

  that same afternoon asa gregory hap-
pened by and because mccalloway had
come to recognize in his influence the
most powerful feudal force operating upon
the boys thought he waited somewhat
anxiously to hear whether the man would
express himself on the topic of the assas-
sination since it was no part of wisdom
to assail deep-rooted ferocities of thought
in minds already matured beyond plas-
ticity he did not himself broach the mat-
ter but he was pleased when asa spoke
gravely and of his own volition

  i done hed hit in head ter go along
down thar ter frankfort with them boys
thet saul gathered tergether but now im
right glad i went by myself thet war a
mighty troublous matter thet came ter
pass thar

  did yer git yore pardon asa asked
boone and the older kinsman hesitated
then made a frank reply

   i haint talkin much erbout thet son
ther governor war hevin a right stressful

time an any favors he showed ter moun-
tain men war bein held up ergainst him
by his enemies but i reckon i kin trust
both of ye yes i got ther pardon

  late in february an item of news filtered
in through the ravines of the hills which
elicited bitter comment the legislature
had voted a reward fund of one hundred
thousand dollars for the apprehension and
conviction of those guilty of the assassina-
tion of senator goebel and heartened
by this spurring the pack of detectives
professional and amateur had cast off
full-cry

  saul fulton lay in jail all that winter
without trial upon the motion of the
commonwealth his day in court was post-
poned by continuance after continuance

  i reckon suggested asa bluntly
they aims ter let him suiter in jail long
enough ter kinderly foce him ter drag in
a few more fellers besides himself-but
hit wont profit em none

  that winter spent its dreary monotony
and through its months boone wellver
was growing in mind and character as
well as in bone and muscle mccalloway
began to see the blossoming of his quix-
otically fantastic idea into some hope and
semblance of reality the boys brain was
acquisitive and flaming with ambition and
victor mccalloway was no routine school-
master but an experimenter in the labora-
tory of human elements he was work-
ing with a character which he sought to
bring by forced marches from the america
of a quaint broad-hearted past to the
america of the present-and future under
his hand the pupil was responding

  the slate-gray ramparts of the hills
reeked with the wet of thawing snows
water-courses swelled into the freshet-
volume of the spring-tide into the
breezes crept a touch of softer promise and
in sheltered spots buds began to redden
and swell then came the pale tenderness
of greens and the first shy music of bird-
notes the sodden threadbare neutrality
of winter was flung aside for the white
blossoming of dogwood and in their wake
came the pink foam of laurel blossom

  on one of those tuneful days while
boone sat on the door-step of victor mc-
calloways house listening to a story of a
campaign far up the nile asa gregory
came along the road with his long elastic
stride and halted there he smiled in-

fectiously as he took the proffered chair
and crumbled leaf tobacco between his
fingers for the filling of his cob pipe

  for a while the talk ran in simple
neighborhood channels they spoke of
drappin an kiverin  in the corn-fields
and the uncomplicated activities of farm
life but after a time asa reached into
his hip-pocket and drew out a rumpled
newspaper which he tendered to victor
mccalloway

  mr mccalloway he said quietly
yere a friend of mine an right now i
have sore need of counsel with a man of
wisdom id be beholden ter ye es so be
yed read thet thar printed piece out loud
the retired soldier took the sheet sev-
eral days old and with the first glance at
its headlines his features stiffened and his
eyes blazed into indignation

  this is a slander he exploded its
an infamous libel do you actually want
me to read it aloud

  asa nodded and in a voice of protest
mccalloway gave audible repetition to a
matter to which he refused the sanction
of belief

new murders for old

  that was the first headline and the
subheads and the item itself followed in
due order

commonwealth uncovers

startling evidence

asa gregory indicted for firing fatal
shot at goebel-alleged he re-
ceived a pardon for prior
offense as price of
fresh infamy

  perhaps the most astounding chapter in a long
serial of the bizarre and melodramatic came to
light today when the franklin grand jury re-
turned a true bill against asa gregory a notori-
ous mountain feudist charging him with the
assassination of governor goebel in the gen-
eral excitement of those days the presence of
gregory in the state capital escaped notice now
it develops from sources which the common-
wealth declines at this time to divulge that on
the day of the tragedy gregory who already
stands charged with the murder from ambush of
several enemies came cold-bloodedly to town to
seek a pardon for one of these offenses and that
in payment for that favor he agreed to accept
unholy appointment as executioner of governor

goebel gregory is now in hiding in the thicketed
country of his native hills and it is foreseen that
before he is taken he mjy invoke the aid of his
clansmen and precipitate further bloodshed

  mccalloway laid down the paper and
stared at the blossom-burgeoning slopes
it was strange lie reflected that one could
so swiftly yield to the instincts of these
wild places for just now it was in his
heart to advise resistance he thought
that trial down there before partizan
juries and biased judges would be a farce
which vitiated the whole spirit of justice

  it might almost have been his own
sentiments that he heard shrilled out from
the excited lips of the boy-a boy whose
cheeks had gone pale and whose eyes had
turned from sky-blue to flame-blue

  theyre jest a seekin ter git ye thar an
hang ye out of hand asa tell em all
ter go everlastiniy ter hell ye kin hide
out hyar in ther mountains an five hun-
dred soldiers couldnt never run ye down
ye kin cross over inter virginny an go
wharsoever ye likes-but ef ye suffers
yourself ter be took theyll hang ye outen
pure disgust fer ther hills

  yes thought victor mccalloway that
was just about what would happen the
boy whom he had been educating to a new
viewpoint had at a stride gone back to
all the primitive sources of his nature yet
he spoke the truth then the voice of
asa gregory sounded again with a meas-
ured evenness

  what docs ye think mr mccallo-
way i was thar on thet day i kin hide
out hyar an resist arrest like ther boy
says an i misdoubts ef i could git any
lavish of justice down thar

  i doubt it gravely sir snorted mc-
calloway by gad i doubt it most
gravely

  an yit went on the other voice
slowly somewhat heavily ef i did foller
thet course hit mout mean a heap of blood-
shed i reckon hitd be mightily like
admittin them charges theyre amakin
too he paused a moment then rose
abruptly from his chair i come ter ask
counsel he said but afore i come my
mind was already done made up im
a-goin over ter marlin town termorrer
mornin an im a-goin ter surrender ter
bev jett ther high sheriff

  dont ye never do hit asa shouted
the boy dont ye never do hit but



the tempering
mccalloway had risen and in his eyes
gleamed an enthusiastic light

   its a thing i couldnt have advised
mr gregory he said in a shaken voice
its a thing that may lead-god knows
where-and yet its the only decent thing
to do

at the edge of marlin town stood the
bungalow of the companys superin-
tendent and in its living-room on either
side of a document-littered table sat two
men one of them silvered of temple
and somewhat portly of stature leaned
back with the tranquility of complete re-
laxation after his days work his face
wore the urbanity of well-being and pros-
perity but the man across from him
leaned forward with an attitude of ner-
vous tension

  to larry masters there was something
nettling in the very repose with which his
visitor from louisville crossed his stout
and well-tailored legs this feeling mani-
fested itself in the jerky quickness of hand
with which the mine superintendent poured
whisky into his glass and hissed soda
after it from the syphon

  wont you fill up tom he invited
shortly the entertainment i can offer
you is limited enough-but at least we
have the peg at our disposal

  thank you-no more colonel wal-
lifarro spoke with a pleasingly modulated
voice trained into effectiveness by years
of jury elocution ive had my evenings
allowance except for a nightcap

   masters rose abruptly from his chair
he tossed down half the contents of his
glass and paced the floor with a restless
stride gnawing at his close-cropped and
sandy mustache his tall well-knit figure
moved with a certain athletic vitality and
his florid face was tanned like a pigskin
saddle-skirt but his brow was corru-
gated in a frown of discontent and his
pale-blue eyes were almost truculent

  by gad tom he flared out with
choleric impetuosity you can put more
righteous rebuke into a polite refusal of
liquor than most men could crowd into a
whole damn temperance lecture i dare
say however youre quite right life spells
something for you its worth conserving
youve got assured position an adoring
family money success hosts of friends
youd be a blithering fool i grant you

to waste yourself in indulgence but im
not so ideally situated i take the cash
and let the credit go 

  yet you have ahead of you some ten
or twelve years more of life than i can
reasonably expect was the quiet re-
sponse you still have youth-or youths
fulfilment-early middle-age

  and a jolly lot that means to me
retorted masters with acerbity i live
here among illiterates working for a cor-
poration on a salary pared to the bone
at the time of life when one ought to be
at the top of ones abilities im the most
pathetic human thing under gods arching
sky-a man who started out with big
promise-and fell by the wayside heaven
help the man who fires and falls back-
and if he can retrieve a bit of temporary
solace from that poor substitute- he
jerked a forefinger toward the bottle-
then i say for heavens sake let him poison
himself comfortably and welcome
colonel wallifarro studied the darkened
scowl of his companion for a moment be-
fore he replied and when he spoke his
own manner retained its imperturbability

  i didnt offer gratuitous criticism
larry he suggested i merely declined
another today

  you know my case tom the
younger of the two caught him up
quickly you know that no younger son
ever came out from england with fairer
expectations of succeeding on his own
ive been neither the fool nor the shirk-
and yet- a shrug of disgust finished
the sentence

  colonel wallifarro studied his cigar
ash without rejoinder and when larry
masters failed to draw a return fire of
argument he sat for a minute or two glumly
silent then as his thoughts coursed back
into other years a slow light kindled in
his eyes as if for a dead dream

  you were always skeptical about
middlesboro even when others were full
of faith-but why he demanded to
you with your bluegrass ideas of fat
acres these hills must always be the rag-
ged fringes of things a meager land with-
out a future it was only that you lacked
imagination

  the speaker swept torrentially on with
as much of argumentative warmth as if
he had not just confessed himself ruined
by reason of his own former confidence

romance

  where the gap came through lay the
natural gateway of the hills hewn out in
readiness by the hand of the almighty
there was water-power-ore there was
coal for smelter and market timber await-
ing the ax and the saw-mill-the whole
tremendous treasure house of a natural
eldorado

  perhaps observed the colonel and
yet when all is said and done it was
only a boom-and it collapsed what-
ever the causes the results are definite
yes it collapsed and we went with
it masters paused to take up and empty
the glass which had started the discus-
sion then with a heightened excitement
he swept on afresh

  yet how near we came gad man
your own eyes saw our conception grow
you saw lots along what had been creek-
bed trails sell at a footage-price that
rivaled new yorks best avenues and
you yourself recognized in me for all your
skepticism a man with a golden future
then after all that you saw me jolly well
ruined-and yet you prate of what life
may hold for me in the vigor of my middle
age

  all that happened ten years back how-
ever the elder man equably reminded his
companion

  it was the old story of a boomand a
collapse and one misfortune-even one
disaster-need not break a mans spirit
you might have come back

  the eyes of the portly gentleman rested
in a momentary glance on the bottle and
glass but that may have been chance at
least he did not mention them

  you think i might have come back
do you the voice of the englishman
had hardened i dont want to be nasty
or say disagreeable things youve been
a staunch friend to me-even when anne
found herself growing bitter against me
well i dont blame her her people had
been leaders always she had the divine
right to an assured place in society and i
had failed i suppose it was natural
enough for her to feel that shed been
done in-but it happened to be the finish
of me id sweated blood to make
middlesboro-and i didnt have the grit
left to commence over

  for the first time-colonel wallifarros

  anne didnt leave you for financial
reasons larry he asserted steadily
shes my niece and you are my friend
but no purpose is to be served by my
listening to ex parte grievances from either
of you

  masters shrugged his shoulders

  i dare say youre quite right he ad-
mitted

  but be that as it may she did leave
me-left me flat if she didnt divorce me
it wasnt out of consideration for my feel-
ings it would almost have been better if
she had all i ever succeeded in doing
for her was to make her the poor member
of a rich family-and thats not enviable
by half and yet if id been a sheer rotter
i could scarcely have fared worse

  if it wasnt consideration for you at
least it was for some one who should be
important to you as it is your little girl
isnt growing up under the shadow of a
sensational divorce record

  the pale-blue eyes of the englishman
softened abruptly and the lips under the
short-clipped mustache changed from their
stiffness to the curvature of something
like a smile into his expression came a
lurking half-shy ghost of winsomeness

  yes yes he muttered the kiddie
god bless her little heart

  after a moment though he drew back
his shoulders with a jerk and spoke again
in a harsher timbre

  anne has been fair enough with me
about the child thougfi im bound to say
ive been jolly well made to understand
that it was only a chivalrous and unde-
served sort of generosity well the kid-
dies almost twelve now and before long
shell be a belle too-poor but related
to all the first families

  mastera paused and when he went on
again it was still with the air of a repressed
chafing of spirit

  i dare say her mother will see to it that
she doesnt repeat the mistake of the pre-
vious generation-marrying a man with
only a splendid expectancy her heart
will be schooled to demand the assured
thing that pointing with pride a ges-
ture which you kentuckians so enjoy-
well with my little girl it will all be done
toward the spindle branch there wont
be much said about the wastrel father
perhaps suggested the other you
are a little less than just

attitude stiffened bringing up his silver-
crowned head defensively

romance

  i dare say shell be a heart-breaker
before long now-and listen man-
masters came a step nearer-dont make
any mistake about me either when shes
here the bottle goes under lock and key

i play the game where shes concerned

  colonel walliferro nodded slowly

  i know that larry he hastily an-
swered i know that if the breach
hadnt widened too far id go as far as a
man could to bring your family together
again under one roof-tree

  thats no use of course admitted
masters with a dead intonation only
remember that down here where im
chained to my little job life aint so
damned gay and sunny at best and dont
begrudge me my liquor

xii

during those following months when
asa gregory lay in jail first in
frankfort then in louisville as a prisoner
of state who had been denied bail the
boy back in the laurel-mantled hills smol-
dered with passionate resentment for what
he believed to be a monstrous injustice

  in his quest of education he sought
refuge from the bitter brooding that had
begun to mar his young features with its
stamp of sullenness asa had killed men
before but it had been in that feud war-
fare which was sanctioned by his own con-
science now he stood charged with a
murder done for hire the mercenary tak-
ing off of a man for whom he had no
enmity save that of the abstract and
political

  upon his kinsmans innocence the boy
would have staked his life and yet he
must look helplessly on and see him thrown
to the lions of public indignation

  of saul he hardly thought at all saul
was small-fry the commonwealth would
treat him as such but upon asa it would
wreak a surcharged anger because to send
asa gregory to the gallows would be to
establish a direct link between the gov-
ernor who had pardoned him and moun-
tain murder-lust

  already the secretary of state had been
disposed of with a promptitude which his
fiiends asserted savored rather of the wolf-
pack than the court-room the verdict had
been guilty and his case was now pending
on a motion for rehearing

  already too a stenographer who had
been in the employ of the fugitive gov-
ernor had been given a life-sentence and
had preferred accepting it without appeal
to risking the graver alternative of the
gallows

   as he lay in jail waiting until the slow
grind of the law-mill should bring him into
its hopper asa too recognized the extreme
tenuousness of his chances

  but it was not until the wheat had been
harvested and threshed in the rich blue-
grass fields that the session of court was
called to order whose docket held for asa
gregory the question of life and death

  that trial was to be at georgetown a
graciously lying town about whose borders
stretched estates where a few acres were
worth as much as a whole farm in the
ragged and meager hills it was a town
of kindly people but just now of very
indignant people blinded by an unbal-
anced anger it was not a hopeful place
for a mountaineer with a notched gun who
stood taxed with the murder from ambush
of a governor

  over the door of the brick court-house
stood an image of the blindfolded goddess
she was a weather-worn deity corroded
out of all resemblance to the spirit of
eternal youthfulness which she should have
exemplified and boone pressed his lips
tight as he entered with mccalloway and
noted that the scales which she held aloft
were broken but that the sword in the
other hand was intact-and unsheathed

  at the stair-head in precaution against
the electrically charged tension of the air
deputies passed outspread hands over the
pockets and hips of each man who entered
in search for concealed weapons about
the semicircular table fronting the bench
and the prisoners dock sat the men of
the press sharpening their pencils and-
waiting

  under the faded portrait of chief jus-
tice marshall a battery of windows let in
the summer sun and the mellow voice of a
distant negro raised somewhere in a camp-
meeting song	

  across a narrow alley-way were other
windows in another building and beyond
them operators sat idling by newly in-
stalled telegraph keys these men had
no interest in the routine of the running
story that was a matter to be handled
by the regular telegraph offices these

by charles neville buck
   newly strung wires would be dedicated to
   a single flash when the climax came

     then the reporters would no longer be
   sitting at their crescent-shaped table a
   few of them would stand framed in those
   court-room windows under the portrait of
   chief justice marshall and as the words
   fell from the lips that held doom their
   hands would rise with one two three or
   four fingers extended as the case might
   warrant

     in response to that prearranged signal
   the special operators would open their keys
   and if one finger had been shown over
   their lines would run the single but suffi-
   cient word death two fingers would
   mean life-imprisonment three acquit-
   tal four would indicate a hung-jury
   that time was still presumably far off
   but the arrangement for it was complete

     in a matter of seconds after that grim
   pantomime occurred foremen of printing
   crews standing by triple-decked presses in
   louisville in cincinnati-in many other
   towns as well-would reach down and lift
   from the floor one of the several type metal
   forms prepared in advance to cover each
   possible exigency with the first flash
   the form for that particular exigency would
   be swung to the big rollers locked into
   place and a switch would be flipped back
   to the hot slag of the melting-pois would
   go the other half-cylinders and within three
   minutes papers damp with ink and news
   would be pouring from the maws of the
   presses into the hands of waiting boys

     to boone these preparations were not
   yet comprehensible but as mccalloway
   led him to a seat far forward he felt the
   tense atmosphere of the place and moment

      he recognized in those lines of opposing
   counsel an array of notability he picked
   out with a glare of hatred the bearded
   man wrhom he prosecution had brought
   as co-counsel from another state because
   of his great repute as a breaker-down of
   witnesses under cross-examination then
   his eyes lighted as down the aisle came
   the full figure of colonel tom wallifarro
   -to take its place among the attorneys for
   the defense there was reassurance in his
   calmness and unexcited dignity

      and after interminable preliminaries he

	heard at last the voice of the clerk droning
   from his docket

    the commonwealth of kentucky
  against asa gregory wilful murder and

after yet other delays the velvety direction
from the bench mr sheriff bring the
prisoner into court

  asas face as he was led through the
side door was less bronzed than formerly
but his carriage was no less erect or con-
fident in a new suit of dark color with
fresh linen instead of his hickory shirt
clcan shaven and immaculately combed
the defendant was a transformed person
and if there remained any semblance of
the highland desperado it was to be found
only in the catlike softness of his tread
and the falcon alertness of his fine brown
eyes pencils at the press table began
their light scratching chorus-the reporters
were writing their description of the
accused

  asa gregorys line of defense had been
foreshadowed in the examining court he
had sworrt that he arrived on the day of
the shooting to petition a pardon and he
had known nothing of what was in the air
until from street talk he learned of the
tragedy

  the chief issue of fact pivoted on his
testimony that on that day he had not
been near the statehouse or executive
building the commonwealth would con-
tradict that claim with the counter-asser-
tion that straight as a hiving bee asa had
hastened from the train to the governors
official headquarters where he had been
cold-bloodedly rehearsed in his grim duties
after firing the shot the prosecution would
contend he had taken command of the
other mountaineers who refused to the po-
lice the privilege of entry and search

  through days weeks even after that
boone sat always in the same place with
steadfast confidence in the eyes which he
bent upon his kinsman

  into the press dispatches began to steal
mention of a boy in a cheap but new suit
of store clothes whose eyes held those of
the prisoner with a rapt and unwavering
constancy it was even said that the
amazingly steady courage of the defendant
seemed at times of unusual stress to lean
on that supporting confidence and that
whenever they brought him from jail to
court-room he looked first of all for the
boy as a pilot might look for a reef-light

  shortly before the commonwealth was
ready to close rumors went abroad it
was hinted that new and sensational wit-
nesses would take the stand with revela-

the tempering
romance

tions as spectacular as the climax of a
melodrama

  boone had followed the evidence with a
tense absorption he had marked the
effect of each point the success or failure
of every blow and he realized what a pow-
erful web was being woven about the man
in whom he fully believed there was no
escaping the cumulative and strengthening
effect of circumstance built upon circum-
stance

  he recognized too how like a keystone
in an arch was the dependence of the state
upon proving one thing-that asa had been
present just after the shooting and in
command of those who barred the doors
of the executive building against legitimate
search he took comfort in the fact that
so far it had not been established by one
sure piece of evidence then came the
last of the commonwealths announced
witnesses

  upon the faces of the attorneys for the
prisoner quivered a dubious expression of
apprehension as they waited the promised
assault of the masked batteries the son
of the man who had walked at senator
goebels side when he fell took the stand
and told with straightforward directness
the story of the five minutes after the shot
had sounded he and a policeman had
sought entrance to the building which
presumably harbored the assassin-and
mountain men had halted him at the door
under the leadership of one to whom the
rest deferred he described that com-
mander with fulness of detail and it was
as if he were painting in words a portrait
of the man in the prisoners dock

  i was there as a volunteer to see that
no one who might be guilty escaped from
the building testified the witness with
convincing candor i noticed one man in
particular because he seemed to be the
unofficial leader of the rest some one
called him asa

  the mans voice was responsibly almost
hesitantly grave and on the faces in the
jury-box one could read the telling im-
pression of his words

  then the bearded attorney whose fame
was secure as a heckler of witnesses rose
dramatically from his chair

  do you see that man in the court-room
now

  for a matter of seconds testifier and
prisoner gazed with level directness into

each others eyes while over the crowded
court-room hung a tense pall of stillness

  then the witness spoke in a tone of be-
wilderment-his words coming slowly-as
if they surprized himself

  no i dont think i see him here

  the poised figure of the lawyer drawn
statuesquely upright winced as painfully
as if a trusted hand had smitten him and
in his abrupt change of expression was
betrayal of dismay and chagrin

  you say-you cant-identify him he
echoed incredulously

  stubbornly the man who was testifying
shook his head

  may i explain in my own way he
inquired and as the lawyer barked rasp-
ingly back at him the court intervened
this is your own witness you must
understand the impropriety of attempting
to embarrass him

  while i was looking at the defendant
there just now went on the man in the
chair i was seeing only his side face and
i was positive that he was the person i
was describing feature for feature and
line for line the likeness seemed exact
i was willing to swear to it but when he
turned and faced me i saw something else
-and now i dont think he is the man
the words can as a puzzled and dum-
founded confession and the witness
paused then went resolutely on again

  this man has a fine pair of clear and
well-matched eyes when one sees them
both at once that one at the door had
something-i cant say just what it was
-that marred one eye i shouldnt call it
a cast exactly-but they didnt match
abruptly the state dismissed that wit-
ness and about the defense tables went
quiet but triumphant smiles which the
jury did not miss as the pencils of the
press writers raced but over boone
wellvers face passed a shadow and asa
catching his eye across the heads of the
crowd read the motion of the boys moving
lips as without sound they shaped the
words

  keep cool now asa keep cool

tain step a man whose face was pasty
with prison pallor his thin body was
garbed in the zebra-stripes of the peniten-
tiarys livery and the hand that he raised
to take oath trembled his voice too
carried a quaver of weakness in its first
syllable

  here at length was the promised sensa-
tion the stenographer who had accepted
his life-term had become star-witness for
the state now enlisted from the ranks
of the accused he had undertaken to tell
what purported to be the inside story of
the plot

  to hear his words one had to bend
attentively yet when he had talked for an
hour the scratching of pencils at the press
table sounded through his pauses almost
clamorous and there was no other sound

   boonesat tight of muscle with his eyes
steadfastly fixed on asa he thought that
just now he was needed but at the pit of
his stomach gnawed a sickness of dread
and it seemed to him that already he could
see the gallows rising from its ugly plat-
form

  the bearded lawyer who had once bat-
tered down this mans own defense now
stood before him shepherding his words on
toward their climax faint response fol-
lowed sharp interrogation with a deadly
effectiveness

   when did you first meet the defendant
-asa gregory

  on the thirtieth of january-in the
forenoon

  where

   at my office in the statehouse

   did your office adjoin that of the sec-
retary of state

   it did

   what occurred at that time and place
mr gregory rapped i let him in
he handed me a letter from the governor
and we went into the secretarys room
then he went over to the window and
looked out-and drew the blind part of
the way down for a while he just studied
the room-taking in its details

   the man in convict garb paused and fell
into a fit of broken coughing

  did vou have anv conversation with
him

   i did sir

  what was it in substance

  i explained to him that the plan was
to kill senator goebel when he came to

the senate that morning i showed him
two rifles in the corner they were of
different makes

  what did he do then

  he had me explain the way to get to
the basement he kneeled down by the
window and sighted one of the guns he
piled up several law-books to rest it on-

and then he said that he was ready-

  mccalloways teeth were tight-clamped
as he listened

  yes go on

  he said he had come to get a pardon
for blowing down old man carr-and was
ready to give back favor for favor pres-
ently i saw senator goebel turning in at
the gate and i said thats him and he
said i see him and i turned and slipped
out of the room as i was on the stairs
i heard a rifle shot-and then several pistol
shots

  boone wellver groaned and the current
of his arteries seemed to run in icy trickles
through his body but he kept his eyes
steadfastly fixed on asa whose life he felt
sure this man was swearing away in per-
jury asa gazed back he even inclined
his head with just the ghost of a nod
and the boy knew that he meant that for
encouragement

  through hours of that day the ghastly
story unwound itself and its tremendous
impact gaining rather than losing impres-
siveness from the faltering style of its tell-
ing left the defense staggered and numbed
mccalloway glancing down at the boys
drawn face felt his own heart sicken

  but when at last the man with the gray
face and the gray-stripped livery had gone
the commonwealths attorney rose and
said in the full-throated voice of master of
the show-

  now we will call saul fulton

  saul had been indicted but never tried
saul too had taken the enemys pay
neither mccalloway nor boone doubted
that all this drama of alleged revelation
was fathered in falsity out of the reward
fund and its workings yet one realized
out of mature experience and the other
out of instinct that to the jury it must
all seem irrefutable demonstration

in marked contrast with the sorry drab-
ness of that last witness was the swagger
of the next who came twirling his mus-
tache with the gusto of pure bravado
saul went back of the others story ad

n

the t e m pering
 ramified its details he told of the moun-
 tain army which he had helped to recruit
 and swore that that force had come with
 a full understanding of its mission

    we went to ther legislature every day
 expectin trouble he declared with a full-
 voiced boastfulness and we were ready
 to weed out the democratic leaders when
 it started

    to what purpose was all fhat planned
 purred the examining lawyer and the re-
 sponse capped it with prompt assurance

   the object was to have a republican
 majority before we got through shooting
 and you were willing to do your part
 virtuously boomed the reply-

 	if it was in fair battle i was willin
 yes sir

    saul particularized he recounted that
 he himself had nominated asa as a de-
 pendable gun-fighter and that on the day
 of the tragedy he had met asa on the
 streets of frankfort asa he asserted had
 brazenly displayed a pocket-full of cart-
 ridges

    he said to me proceeded the witness
  them catridges comes out of a lot thets
 done made histry whenever i looks over
 ther sights of a rifle-gun i gits me either
 money or meat an this time ive done
 got me both 

    boone wellver had been leaning tensely
 forward in his seat as he listened here
 at last to his own -knowledge the words
 that were cementing his kinsmans doom
 were utterly and viciously false he had
 been a witness to that meeting and it had
 been saul and not asa who had seen danger
 in the possession of cartridges it had
 been satil too who had excitedly in-
 structed him to destroy the evidence

    but saul continued glibly

   asa had done named ter me back thar
 in ther mountains thet he reckoned him
 an ther governor could swap favors so
 when we met up that day in frankfort
 he said me an ther big man we got
 tergether an done a leetle business 

    the court-room was tensely electrically
 silent when a boy rose out of his chair
 and with the suddenness of a bursting shell
 shrilled out in defiance

    thets a damn lie saul an ye knows

 hit i was right thar an-

    the instant clatter of the judges gavel
 and the staccato outbreak of the judges
 voice interrupted the interruption

   silence mr sheriff bring that dis-
turber before the court

   still trembling with white-hot indigna-
tion boone was led forward with the
sheriffs hand on his shoulder until he
stood under the stern questioning of eyes
looking down from the bench

   but instantly too colonel wallifarros
smoothly-controlled voice was addressing
the court

  may it please your honor before
you punish this boy i should like
to offer a word or two of explanation

   so boone did not go to jail but after a
sharp reprimand he was sworn as a wit-
ness for the defense and excluded from the
court-room

  when he took the witness stand later
it was with a recovered composure-and
his straightforward story went far toward
shaking the impression saul had left be-
hind him-yet not far enough

   he realized with black chagrin that as
long as he had sat there steadfastly calm
he had been to asa a tower of strength-
but that when he had broken out he hcd
forfeited that privilege-and left his kins-
man unsuccored

  at last the commonwealth closed and
asa himself came to the stand had he
been possessed of a lawyers experience he
could hardly have evaded more skilfully
the snares set in his path as with imper-
turbable gallantry he met his skilled
hecklers the even calmness of his velvety
eyes became a matter of newspaper report
and when he had finished his direct testi-
mony and had been turned over to the
enemy the fashion in which he cared for
himself also found its way into the news
columns

   asa kept before him the realization that
he had been advertised as a bad man
and an assassin just now he was intent
upon impressing the jury with his urbane
proof against exasperation even when the
invective of insinuation mounted to
ferocity

   you have known the witness saul ful-
ton for years have you not demanded
the cross-examiner

  ive known him all my life

  can you state any motive he should
have for offering malicious and false evi-
dence against you

  any reason for his lyin the pris-
oner gazed at the barking attorney with a

tfbbbitei l i i rom

calm seriousness and replied suavely
no sir only that hes swearin to save
his own neck from the rope an thets a
right pithy reason i reckon

  yet all the while that he was milking his
steep up-hill fight asa was feeling a secret
disquiet growing to an obsession within
him he could not forget that some one
upon whose reassurance he had leaned had
been banished from that place where his
enemies were bent upon his undoing he
felt as if the red lantern had been quenched
on a dangerous crossing and the psychol-
ogy of the thing gnawed at his overtried
nerves

  boones freckled face and wide blue
eyes had seemed to stand for serenity
where all else was hectic and fevered

  to asa that intangible yet tranquilizing
support had meant what the spider meant
to bruce and now it had been taken from
him

  the bearded attorney who had de-
stroyed defendant after defendant was bat-
tering at him with the massed artillery
of vindictive and unremitting aggressive-
ness	

  for a long while asa fenced warily
coolly remembering that to slip the curb
upon his temper meant ruin but as assault
followed assault through hours his senses
began to reel his surety began to weaken
and his eyes began to see red

  the attorney who was scourging him
with the whips of law saw the first break
in his armor and bored into it with ever-
increased vindictiveness

  into asas mind flashed a picture of the
cabin back home of the wife suffering an
agony of anxiety of the baby whom he
might never again see he seemed groping
with his gaze for the steadying eyes of the
boy who was no longer there-whom he
desperately needed

  asas gittin right mad whispered one
mountaineer to another id hate ter en-
counter him right now in a highway an
be an enemy of hisn

  but the bearded attorney who was not
in the highway only badgered and heckled
him with a more calculating precision and
as he slowly shook the witness out of self-
restraint into madness he was himself de-
liberately circling from his place at the
commonwealths table to a position
directly back of the jury-box

  now having achieved that vantage

ance

  point he watched the prisoners face grow i
  somber and furious as the prisoners head
  lowered like that of a charging bull

   one more question he put-a question
 of deliberate insult which brought an ad-
 monitory rap of the judges gavel then
 he thrust out an accusing finger which 
 pointed straight into the defendants face 
 look at him now gentlemen of the
 jury he dramatically thundered look
 at those mismated eyes and determine
 whether or not this is the man who blocked
 the statehouse doorway-the assassin who
 laid low a governor

    gazing from their seats in the jury-box
  the men of the venire saw before them
  and facing them a prisoner whose two fine
  calm eyes had been transfigured and mis-
  mated by passion-whose pupils were
  marked by some puzzling phenomenon of
  rabid anger that seemed to leave them no
  longer twins

    it was much jater that the panel came
 in from the room where it had wrangled
 all night but that had been the decisive
 moment three or four reporters detached
 themselves from their places at the press
 table and stood close to the windows

   then the foreman spoke for in ken-
 tucky the jury not only decides guilt but
 fixes the penalty and the reporters raised
 one finger each it meant that the verdict
 was death

 as victor mccalloway and boone went
 to the railroad station on the after-
 noon of the day that brought the trial to
 its end they found the platform crowded
 with others who like themselves were
 turning away from a finished chapter

    the boy stared ahead now with a glassy
 misery and the eyes and ears usually so
 keenly awake to new sights and sounds
 seemed too stunned for service had it
 been the boy himself instead of his kins-
 man who stood condemned to die he could
 hardly have suffered more indeed had it
 been his own tragedy boone would not
 have allowed himself this surrender of
 bearing under the common gaze but would
 have held his chin more defiantly high

   back in the hills boone wellver was
 for the first time listless over his studies
 and even when he stood sword in hand
 before mccalloway the spirit of swift en-



the tempering
thusiasm seemed departed from him he
had moved away from the cabin where
the granny folks dwelt to help araminta
gregory run the farm which had been be-
reft of its man and his eyes followed her
grief-stricken movements with a wordless
sympathy

  mccalloway realized that now even more
than formerly the flame of the convicted
mans influence was operating on the raw
material of this impressionable mind weld-
ing to vindictiveness the feudal elements
of its metal but mccalloway had learned
patience in a hard school and now he was
applying the results of his experience

  slowly under his guidance the stamp of
hatred which had latterly marred the face
of his youthful protege began to lighten
boone was as yet too young to go under
the yoke of unbroken pessimism the
very buoyancy of his years and splendid
health argued that somehow the clouds
must break meanwhile his task was clean-
cut-and dual asas woman must
have from the stony farm every stalk and
ear of corn that could be wrung from its
stinted productivity and he must put be-
hind him that ignorance which had so long
victimized his kind

  so once more he turned to his books
when he was not busy with hoe or plow

  one day while the boy and the man
sat together in mccalloways house
knuckles rapped sharply on the door it
is contrary to the custom of frontier cau-
tion for one to come as far as the threshold
without first raising his voice in announce-
ment from a greater distance

  but the door opened upon a grizzled man
at the sight of whose face mccalloway
bent forward as if confronted by a specter
-and indeed the newcomer belonged to a
world which he had renounced as finally
as if it had been of another incarnation

  this visitor was tall lean and weather-
beaten his face was long and somewhat
dour but tanned brown and instead of
speaking he brought his hand to his tem-
ple with a smart salute it was such a
salute as bespoke a long life of soldiering
and the second-nature of military habit
the voice in which mccalloway greeted
him was almost unrecognizable as his
own because if was both far-away and
strained

  sergeant he exclaimed what has
brought you here

ance

  the lad sorr the other gravely re-
minded him i must speak with ye alone
tis a verra private and a verra serious
matter that brings me

  boone had never heard -so hard a note
in his benefactors voice as that which
crept into his curt reply

  it must needs be-to warrant your
coming without permission mactavish
they were just finishing their daylight
supper and the boy rose pushing back his
chair faithfully he regarded his pledge
of respecting the others privacy whenever
he was not invited to share it and instinc-
tively he felt that this was no moment
for his intrusion

  i reckon ill hev ter be farin over thar
ter see how asas womans cornin on he
remarked casually as he reached for his
hat that lay at his feet like es not she
needs a gittin of firewood erginst night-
fall

  but the matter-of-fact tone and manner
were on the surface boone secretly dis-
trusted the few messages that came to his
preceptor from the outside world by
such voices he might be called back again
and hearken to the summons and boone
could not contemplate existence with both
his idols ravished from his temple

  now he closed the door behind him
in so preoccupied a mood that he left his
rifle standing against the wall forgotten
and mccalloway remained standing by the
table rather inflexible of posture and sternly
inquisitoril of countenance

  mactavish he said in sharply clipped
syllables you are one of few-a
very few-who know of my incognito and
address i have relied upon you implicitly
to guard those secrets i trust you can
explain following me into what you must
know was a retirement not to be trespassed
upon without incurring my anger-my
very serious anger

  respectfully but with a face full of
eager resoluteness the other saluted again

  general he said its china-they
need you there

  sergeant- an angry light leaped in
the steel-gray eyes- if they want me in
china some one whom i have trusted has
betrayed my identity no living soul
there ever heard of victor mccalloway-
mister mccalloway not genera anything
mind youiv

  the newcomer crossed to the center of

eville buck	
romance

the room and his movements were quick
and precise as are those of the drill-
ground

  to every other man on earth ye may
be mister mccalloway-but to me ye are
my general before id betray any trust
ye might place in me sorr id cut off that
hand at the wrist as ye ken sorr full well
ive told nae soul where ye worr ive
only said that id seek for ye

  but in gods name how-

  if i may interrupt ye sorr i am no
longer sergeant-major mactavish im a
time-retired man at home but when i wear
a uniform now its that of the army of the
manchu emperor they seek to reorgan-
ize their army along western lines they
want genius they ken nothin of ye save
that one victor mccalloway was once a
british officer of high rank who served so
close to dinwiddie that dinwiddies
strategy is known to him read this sorr
and yell understand more of the matter

   the general took the large official-look-
ing missive and stood for a moment with
a drawn and concentrated brow before he
slit its linen-lined covering

  the feel of the thing in his fingers
brought to him a certain stirring and quick-
ening of the pulses-such a restiveness as
may come to the retired thoroughbred at
the far-off sound of the paddock bugle or
to the spent war-horse at the rolling of
drums

  the heavy blue paper and the thick
seal set into disquieting momentum an
avalanche of memories active days which
he had resolved to forget were conjured
into rebirth as he handled this bulky en-
velope which proclaimed its officialdom
even the daily papers came to him here
with desultory lack of sequence

  he knew in disjointed fashion how that
same summer an anti-foreign revolt had
broken out in shantung and spread to pe-
chili he had read that the japanese gov-
ernment had despatched twenty thousand
men to china later he had followed the
all too meager accounts of how the allies
had raced for peking to relieve the besieged
legations

  the young emperors ambition to im-
press upon his realm the stamp of western
civilization had made him for two years a
virtual prisoner to the empress dowager
and her reactionaries now in turn die
empress dowager was in flight and presum-

ably the japanese working in concert with
agents of the captive emperor and prince
ching were looking toward the future

  it would seem that they divined once
more the opportunity to occidentalize army
and government if so it was the rising
of a world tide which might well run to
flood and it offered him a mans work at
all events this letter which caused his
fingers to itch and tremble as they held
it came from high japanese sources and it
was addressed only excellency without
a name the envelope itself was directed
to the honorable victor mccalloway
for a long time he stood- there immov-
able looking at the paper as great dreams
marched before him organization up-
building-that was his metier

  seeing the rapt concentration of his
brow and thejiunger of his eyes the for-
mer british sergeant spoke again with per-
suasive fervor

  go under any name ye like sorr
yell be prompt to give it glory for
many years i served under yer general
for gods sake let me take my commands
from ye once again come out to china
sorr where they need a true soldier-
and can keep silent

  the hermit strode over and laid a hand
on the shoulder of his visitor their eyes
met and held

  old comrade said mccalloway as the
rust of huskiness creaked in his voice i
know you for the truest steel that ever
god put into the blade of a mans soul-
but i must have time to think

  he crossed the room slowly and took up
dinwiddies sword tenderly he drew the
blade from the scabbard and as he looked
at it his eyes first glowed with fires of long-
ing then grew misty with the sadness of
remembrance

   after that he laid the scabbard down and
handled once more the sheets that had been
in the envelope he did not reread the
written sentences but let his fingers move
slowly along the smooth surface of the
paper while his pupils held as far-away
a look as if they were seeing the
land from which the communication had
come

  but after a little mccalloway came out
of that half-hypnotized absorption and his
eyes wandered about the room until finally
they fell on the rifle that the mountain
boy had forgotten to take away with him



the tempering
romance

   he knew boone well enough to feel sure
that he had not gone far without remem-
bering he was certain too that his young
protege would have returned for it before
now had he not been inhibited by his def-
erence for the elders privacy

   over there across the world wras an army
to be shaped disciplined-but an army
of alien blood of yellow skins here was
the less conspicuous task to which he had
set his hand-the shaping of a single life
beset with hereditary dangers into a wor-
thy edifice of which the timbers and ma-
sonry were anglo-saxon and the pattern
americanism he had too far committed
himself to that architecture to turn back

  slowly he shook his head the strug-
gle had been sharp but the decision was
final

  no mactavish old comrade and old
friend he said very seriously no ive
withdrawn from all that ill not deny
that my hand sometimes aches for a grip
on a saber-hilt and my ears are hungry for
a bugle-but thats all past go out and
make an army there if you can but
i stay here i needs must stay

xv

one day mccalloway received a pa-
per several days old that contained
a piece of news which he was anxious for
boone to see at once and he straightway
set out to find the boy

   araminta greeted him at the door of the
gregory cabin with apathetic eyes

	booneys done gone out with his rifie-
gun atter squirrels she said i heered
him shoot up on ther mountain side thar
not five minutes back

   before he followed the boy mccalloway
read to her and construed the item in the
paper and for the first time in many weeks
the hard wretchedness of her heart softened
to tears and a faint ray of hope stole
through her misery

  mccalloway began climbing the hill-
side searching the thickets for the boy and
at last he saw him while he himself re-
mained unseen boone was standing with
his gaze turned toward louisville-and its
jail-two hundred and more miles distant
his face was like that of a fanatic in
a religious trance and his right hand
gripped his rifle so tightly that the

knuckles showed out white-splotched
against the tanned flesh

  i failed ye asa came the self-accus-
ing voice in a tight-throated strain 
bust out and got sent outen ther cote-room
when ye needed me in thar ter give ye
countenance but god knows i haint fergot
ye he paused there and his chest heaved
convulsively an god he knows too i
aims ter avenge ye he ended up with a
dedication of savage sincerity while his
gaze still seemed to be piercing the hills
toward the city where his kinsmen lay con-
demned

  mccalloway came forward then and
while he talked boone listened with atten-
tive patience but an obdurate face

  the man sought to exact a promise that
until he was twenty-one boone should
hold his hand so far as saul fulton was
concerned given those plastic years he
could hope to wean the lad gradually away
from the tigerish and unforgiving ferocity
of his blood but boone could only shake
his head unable either to argue or to yield

  then mccalloway sketched the seem-
ingly irrelevant narrative of what had oc-
curred in china-of the peril of the lega-
tions he talked of an emperor captive to
court intrigue and slowly the lads eyes
which had been until now too preoccupied
with his own wormwood to think of other
matters began to liven into interest

  but thets all plum acrost ther world
from hyar though he asserted in a pause
as if he begrudged the arresting of his at-
tention whats hit got ter do with me-
an asa

  general mccalloway cleared his throat
it came hard for him to talk of himself
pd of a sacrifice made for another

  it has this to do with you my boy
he announced bluntly i have been of-
fered a soldiers job over there i have
been invited to aid in reorganizing an army
that would help to stabilize china-and i
have refused

  boone wellvers lips parted in amaze-
ment

  refused he gasped fer gods sake
what made ye do hit

  because of you was the sober re-
sponse i thought you needed me and
i thought you were worth standing by
fer me the lad was trembling again
but this time not with anger i reckon
ill be powerful beholden ter ye all my

life fer thet-but ye hednt ought ter hev
done hit they needs ye over thar too
an thars monstrous numbers of em from
what ye narrates

  i know it boone mccalloway spoke
earnestly ive centered some very am-
bitious dreams about your future the
time is hardly ripe to explain them but
you have a great opportunity-unless you
throw it away in vengeful fury if you
wont trust me and suffer me to guide you
-until you come of age at least-i had
much better have gone to china

  the boy turned away and in his set
face mccalloway could read that for him
this was an actual moment of gethsemane
through his nature as over a hotly em-
battled field surged contrary and warring
emotions and between them he was cruelly
buffeted

  god knows im wishful he broke out
at length an god knows atter what yeve
jest told me i haint got no license ter
deny ye nothin ye asks but- the end
of his sentence came like a sob but ye
wouldnt ask me ter be disloyal ter my
own kith an kin would ye

  no-but i would ask you to have a
higher loyalty

  boone stood trembling like an ague vic-
tim it was no light matter for him to
give so binding a pledge

  no gregory ner no wellver haint
nuver died on ther gallows tree yit he
faltered thars two things id done
swore ter do one of em was ter git
saul i reckon though that could wait
what is the other thing

  thet afore they hangs him-some
fashion or other-ive got ter git a gun
in thar ter asa so he kin kill hisself hit
haint fitten thet he should die by a rope
like a common feller

  the emotion-laden voice became almost
shrill

  even ther carrs an blairs dont hang
they come nigh ter hangin one oncet but
a kinsman saved him

  how inquired mccalloway and the
boy responded gravely

  he lay up on ther hill-side an shot his
uncle ter death as they was takin him
from the jail-house ter ther gallows
truly reflected the soldier he was model-
ing with grim and stiff clay but he only
said-

n	the ten

n c e -

  promise me that as to saul you will
wait until you are twenty-one

  boone did not reply for five full minutes
but at the end of that time he nodded his 
head

  i kaint deny ye nothin atter what
yeve done fer me he assented briefly

  then mccalloway read from the paper
his scrap of encouragement the court
of appeals had granted the secretary of
state a rehearing

  but thet haint asa objected the boy
i dont keer nothin erbout thet feller

  mccalloway smiled

  its a similar case tried by the same
court and involving the same principles

it indicates that asa will have a new trial
too

 ef he comes clar announced boone
with the suddenly rocketing spirits of boy-
hood i reckon asa kin handle his own
affairs

mccalloway had set himself to
preparing boone within a year from
that fall for entrance into the state uni-
versity there was but a faint background
of prior attainment against which to paint 
many things but there was an avidly ac-
quisitive pupil a tireless teacher and an
intensive plan of education

  gregory was still in the louisville jail-
where indeed a half dozen other years were
yet to find him the secretary of state
had come through his second trial with a
second conviction and had once more been
granted a rehearing

  saul fulton the star witness in asas j
trial had disappeared and report had it
that he had gone to south america-but
the record of his former testimony re-
mained fixed in the stenographers notes
and was fully available for later use-so
that his going lifted no shadow from asas 
future

  i reckon they squashed ther indictment
ergin him boone commented bitterly to
mccalloway an paid him off with some
of thet thar blood money

  he paused and then went on holding 
his finger between the pages of the book
he was studying hes done fared a long
way off-but some day hell fare back
again i stands full pledged twell i comes
of age an i aims ter keep my word atter
thet i haint makin no brash promises 
ther hate in my heart hit dont seem ter

per inc
romance esgfefeg

slacken none i mistrusts hit wont-
never

  but if the festering grievance did not
slacken at least it seemed just now
partly submerged in the great adventure
of going down to the world below and be-
coming a collegian

  he went early in the autumn when he
was seventeen and mccalloway who ac-
companied and matriculated him came
away smiling he had felt as if he were
leading a wolf-cub down into a kennel of
blooded hounds but when he had watched
the self poise with which his registrant
bore himself and how quickly amused
smiles faded away under his level gaze he
left with a reassured confidence

  when the days began to grow crisp the
uncouth scholar saw for the first time the
lads in leather and moleskin tackling and
punting out on the campus in the early try-
outs of the seasons football practice he
looked on at first with a somewhat satirical
detachment but when the scrimmages took
on the guise of actual ferocity his interest
altered from tepid disapproval for sich
foolery to a realization that it was no
gals play-party

  several afternoons later boone shyly
intercepted the coach as he ltd out the
practice squads

  does thet thar football business be-
long ter a club-or somethin he inquired
or kin any feller git inter hit

  the coach looked at the roughly dressed
lad with the unruly hair who talked in
barbaric phrases-and his practised eye
took in the sinewy strength of the well-
muscled body he appraised the power of
the broad shoulders and the slim agile
lines of waist and legs and gave him a
chance

  from the beginning it was evident that
boone wellver would make the scrub team
he was a tornado from the instant the ball
was snapped-an injia rubber idjit on a
spree and yet this mystifying wolf-cub
from the hills came back to the coach in
less than a week with an almost sullen face
and announced shortly-

  i haint goin ter play no more foot-
ball i aims ter quit hit

  quit it why

  ive ben sludyin hit over the retiring
candidate gloomily explained a man
thet haint no blood kin ter me is payin
what hit costs ter send me hyar i haint

hardly nothin but a charity feller nohow
an until he says hits all right i dont
aim ter spend ther time hes payin fer
out hyar playin fool games

  at the solemnness and the unconscious
selt-righteousness of the tone a laugh went -
up and boone turned with a straight-lined
mouth to meet the derisive outburst

  but im out here now though- he
added pointedly lowering his head as does
a bull about to charge an i kin stay a
leetle longer if any of you fellers or
ther whole damn passel of ye thinks im
quiltin because im timorous id be right
glad ter take ye on hvar an now-fist and
skull

  there was no acceptance of the invita-
tion and boone turning with his shoulders
straight marched away 

  but when mccalloway read his letter
he promptly responded

  a razor is made to shave with its purpose
is work and only work still if it isnt honed
and stropped it loses its edge its hardly fair to
regard as wasted the time spent on keeping
that edge keen

  i want you to get the most out of college
and that doesnt mean only what you get out
of the books if i were you id play football
and play it hard

  boone went down the stairs four steps at
a time he could hear the coachs whistle
out on the campus and he came like a
hound to the chase

  hi thar he yelled kin i git back
in thet outfit he lows hits all right fer
me ter play

  back in the hills victor mccalloway
was more than a little lonely he began to
realize how deeply this boy-at first almost
a waif-had stolen into the affections of
his detached life once or twice he went
to lexington to see how his protege pro-
gressed and he had several brief visits from
general prince and more than several from
larry masters after what seemed a very
long while indeed boone came home for
his first summer vacation

  araminta gregory had a brother at her
farm now so the boy went direct to the
house of victor mccalloway which was
henceforth to be his home

years younger than boone when he had
gone away a lad of seventeen he had been
untroubled by thoughts of girls and she
had certainly wasted no meditation upon
him

  but the boone who came back was not
quite the same boy who had gone away
he was still roughly dressed judged by
exacting standards but corduroy had sup-
planted his old jeans and he returned with
a much developed figure and an improved
bearing

  now one afternoon happy spradling
stood with a pail by a spring-branch of
crystal water as boone came by and
halted she too had been to one of those
settlement schools that were just beginning
to introduce new standards in the hills
and her homecoming to unrelieved crudities
was not an unmixed pleasure certain it is
that the slim girl in her calico gown was
blessed with a fresh and vigorous beauty
her sloe-brown eyes were heavy lashed and
her skin was blossom-clear dark hair
crowned her well-poised head in heavy
masses and the boy was surprized be-
cause he had not remembered her as so
lovely

  ye look right sensibly like a picture
outen ther bible of rebecca at the well
he banteringly announced and the girl
flushed

  ye aint quite so uncurried of guise as
ye used to be your own self boone she
generously acceded and they both laughed

  they talked on for awhile and before
boone started away the girl invited shyly
with lids that drooped-

  come over sometime boone an tell me
all about the college

  but it happened that the next day he
went with a note from mccalloway to the
house of larry masters the mine boss
at the edge of marlin town and there fate
ambushed him in the person of the girl
who had asked him to dance at the christ-
mas party

  anne masters came to the door in re-
sponse to the boys knock and when he
had seen her he stood hesitant with his
eyes fixed upon her until her cheeks
flushed while he forgot the note he had
brought for her father

  anne herself did not recognize him at
first for boone stood close to six feet now
and although he would always be in a
fashion careless of dress he would never

again be the sloven as were the kinsmen
about him his corduroy breeches flannel
shirt and boots that laced half-way up the
calf all seemed a part of himself like a
a falcons plumage but what the girl
noticed first since she was both young and
impressionable was the crisp curl of his
red-brown hair and the direct fearlessness
of his sky-blue eyes

  i reckon ye dont remember me he
hazarded by way of introduction and she
shook her head

  have i seen you before she inquired
and boone found it difficult to talk to her
because he was so busy looking at her

  there had been girls as well as boys at
the state university but among them had
been none like anne masters boone was
to learn from a broader experience that
there were few like her-anywhere even
now when she was a bud not yet blos-
somed she had that indescribable fairy
godmothers gift to which no analyst can
fit a formula-the charm which lays its
spell upon others and the gift of individu-
ality

  youve seed me-seen me-i mean-
before but its right natcherl fer ye to
forgit it because it was a long spell back
you gave me the first christmas gift i ever
got in my life-a piece of plum-cake do
you remember me now

  the light of recollection broke over her
face illuminating it-and anne masters
had those eyes that actually sparkle within
-the dancing eyes that are much rarer
than the phrase

  of course i remember you ive
thought about you-lots ive always
called you the fruit-cake boy suddenly
her laugh rippled out in a lilting merri-
ment dont you remember when you
challenged morgan with the fencing
foils

  oh exclaimed boone flushing id
plum disremembered that

  it was june with days of diamond wea-
ther and the bloom still upon wild rose and
rhododendron anne looked away beyond
the boys head to the tallest crest of the
many that ringed the town suddenly she
demanded-

  have you ever been up there-at the
tip-top of that mountain

  he nodded his head and she at once
commanded

  i want you to show me the way up

t he tempering
romance	

there i want to go up and climb to the
top of that tree that you can see from here
-the one that stands up higher than all
the others

  boone shook his head soberly

  its a right hazardous undertakin fer
anybody thet isnt used to sealin clifts
he objected why do you want to go up
there to the top of old slag-face

  her expression had clouded to auto-
cratic displeasure at his failure of immedi-
ate assent but only for an instant then
her eyes altered again from coercive brown
to irresistible smile

  why she exclaimed why does a
bird want to fly- up there at the top of
that tree youd be almost in the sky
youd be looking down on everything but
the clouds themselves when i was a
little girl she announced suddenly they
had a hard time persuading me that i
couldnt fly they had to keep watching
me because id climb up on things and try
to fly down

  have you plum outgrown that idee
he inquired somewhat dryly because im
not cravin to help you fly offen that moun-
tain-top

   her laugh rippled out like bird notes as
she replied with the large scorn of four-
teen years

  that was when i was a child after
a moment she added appealingly-the
last time i saw you general prince said
that when i came to these hills youd be
charitable to me

   i aims to be he asserted stoutly but
it wouldnt skeercely be charitable to be
the cause of your breakin an arm or-
he paused an instant before adding with
sedateness-or a limb

but anne had her way she always
had her way and some days later they
looked down on an outspread world from
the crest of slag-face

  boone had not been long in discovering
that this slender girl was driven by a
dauntless spirit that made of physical cour-
age a positive fetish so he had pretended
weariness himself from time to time and
demanded a breathing spell

  the sky overhead was splendidly soft
and blue broken by tumbling cloud masses
which it seemed one could almost reach
out and touch

  from the foreground where they sat

flushed and resting with moss and rock and
woodland about them the prospect went
off into distances where mountain shadows
fell across valleys and other ridges were
ranked row on row still more remote
was the vagueness of the horizon whose
misty violet merged with the robins-egg
blue of the sky

   the girl stood leaning against the tree
and her violet eyes were full of imaginative
light

   through lids half-closed the boy looked
at her she was an exponent of that world
of which he had dreamed he thought of
the hall where he had first seen her of the
silk and broadcloth of the mahagony and
silver of the whole setting which was
home to her and to him a place into which
he had come as a trespasser in homespun

   into the tempering of the crude ore came
 new element asa gregory had been the
fire and so far victor mccalloway had
been the water now came the third fac-
tor of lifes process-the oil-for there and
then on the hill-top he had fallen in love
and it was not until he was riding home
in the starlight that he stopped to con-
sider the chances of disaster

   it had been a wonderful day accepted
without questioning but now he drew his
horse suddenly to a stop and took his hat
from his head for a time he sat there in
his saddle as unmoving as if he and the
beast he rode were inanimate parts of an
equestrian group-the statue of a pioneer
lad rough-mounted

   his face stiffened painfully and he licked
his lips finally he said to the dark woods
where the whippoorwills were calling and
the fireflies flickering

   great god i mout jest as well fall
itrlove with a star up thar in heaven
something like agroan escaped him and
after a while he gathered up his reins
again he spoke but in a dull voice

   ill quit afore i get in too far to-
morrow night ill go over thar and set up
with happy spradling

  he remembered how they had laughed
at him at college when quite naturally
he had used that term setting up with a
gal to express the idea of courtship now
he laughed himself but bitterly that was
what his own people called it and after
all it was better to remember that he was
of his own people

   the next night boone kept his word

by charles neville buck


                  r o m a n c e -

he brushed his clothes and did what he
could with the unruly crispness of his hair
and then he set out for the log house of
cyrus spradling on the head waters of
snag ridge

  he was not going on this his first formal
visit to a girl with such leaping pulses as
might have been expected he was follow-
ing out an almost grim determination quite
devoid of eagerness having lost his heart
to royalty he was now bent on forcing
himself into a society where he had a right
to be

  he had not slept much that night after
the excursion to slag-face and what sleep
he had had had been troubled by dreams
in which anne had stood smiling down on
him from the mountain-top while he
looked up from a deep gorge where the
shadows lay black he was driven by a
mad sense of necessity to climb up and
stand beside her-but always he slid back
or fell from narrow ledges until he was
bruised bleeding and unsuccessful he
woke up panting and afterward dreamed
the same thing over and every time he
fell he found happy waiting in the gorge
and saying

  why dont ye stay here with me you
dont have to climb after me-and im a
right pretty gal

  always too he answered in the words
that anne had used

  why do i want to go up there up
there youd be looking down on everything
but the clouds themselves and he would
begin climbing once more clutching with
raw fingers upon frail and slippery sup-
ports

  all day he had argued with himself and
being young and unversed in such prob-
lems he told himself that the only way to
halt this runaway thing within himself that
led to no hope was to set his heart upon
something which lay in reach his inex-
perience told him that happy liked him
that she was a nice girl trying to better
her condition in life as he was himself
trying and he meant to commandeer his
own heart and lay it at her feet it was
of course an absurd and impossible thing
to undertake but this he must learn for
himself

  as boone reached the house old man
spradling sat on his porch in the twilight
with his cob pipe between his teeth cyrus
remained what his foreparents had been

before him a rough-hewn man of undevi-
ating honesty and of an innate kindliness
that showed out only in deeds and not at
all in demonstrativeness

  just now cyrus wore an expressionof
countenance that was somewhat glum as he
watched the lingering afterglow which
edged the western crests of the kaintuck
ridges with pale amber

  set ye a cheer booney he invited
with a brief nod i reckon ye didnt
skeercely fare over hyar ter set an talk
with me but ther gal haint quite through
holpin her mammy with the dish-washin
yit an i wants ter put some questions
ter ye afore she comes out

  the lad drew a hickory-withed chair
forward and sat down laying his hat on
the floor at his feet

  yeve done been off ter college son
began old cyrus reflectively as he bit on his
pipe-stem and judicially nodded his head

  ive always countenanced book ipre
myself even when folks hes faulted me fer
hit ive contended thet ther times change
an what was good enough fer ther parents
haint of needcessity good enough fer
ther young ones peared like ter me a
body kinderly hes a better chanst ter be
godly ef he haint benighted

  i reckon there aint no two ways about
that proposition agreed the boy eagerly
hit just stands ter reason

  an yit hyar latterly suggested the
mountaineer dubiously ive done com-
menced ter misdoubt ef ive been right
atter all thets wbat i wanted ter ques-
tion ye about my woman an me we
sent happy off ter thet new school in
leslie an since shes come home i mis-
doubts ef her name fits her es well es hit
did afore she went over thar she used
ter sing like a bird all day an now she
dont

  i dont see how knowin something can
make a body unhappy protested boone

  cyrus spradling studied him with a
keen but not unkindly fixedness of gaze

  ye dont dont ye waal let me nar-
rate ye a leetle parable suppose you an
me hes done been pore folks livin ki a
small dwellin-house weve done been
plum content because we haint never
knowed nothing better but suppose one
of us goes a visitin ter rich kinfolks-an
tother one stays home

  he paused there to rekindle his pipe



the tempering
r o m a n c e

and the voice of his resumed parable
was troubled

  ther one thets been away hes done
took up notions of wealth that he kaint
nuver hope ter satisfy the mean cabin
seems a heap meaner when he comes back
ter hit but ther other pore damn fool hes
still happy an contented because he dont
know no better 

  i reckon laughed the young visitor
if the feller that had gone away was any-
thing but the disablest body in the world
hed set about improving the house he had
to dwell in

  i hope ter god yere right booney
hits been a mighty sober thing fer me
ter ponder over though whether i was
helpin my gal or hurtin her

  boone was smitten with a sense of guilt
he felt that he ought to make confession
that he had come here tonight because he
had already recognized a new flame in his
heart and a flame which the voice of
sanity and wisdom told him he must
quench-that he was here because discon-
tent had driven him but his voice was
firm as he made some commonplace reply
cyrus nodded his satisfaction

  mebby if thars a few boys like ye
growin up hyarabouts ther few gals thet
gits larnin wont be foredoomed ter lead
lonesome lives atter all

  the moonlight was beginning to convert
the dullness of twilight into a nocturne of
soft and tempered beauty

  boone felt suddenly appalled as if the
father had given him parental recognition
and approval and laid upon him an obliga-
tion he wanted to rise and frame some
excuse for immediate flight but it was of
course too late for that

  the evening star came up over the dark
contours of the ridge it shone soft and
lustrous in the sky where other stars would
soon add their myriad points of light but
however many others might fill the heavens
there would still be only one evening star
and boone as he waited for one girl fell
to thinking of the other with whom he had
climbed slag-face yesterday-the girl who
had set fire to his young imagination

  then happy came out of the door and
soon after the father went in

  thar haint no place fer an ignrant old
feller like me out hyar amongst ther young
an wise he chuckled as he left them

i reckons ye aims ter talk algebry an
sich-like

  the mountains were great upward
sweeps of velvet darkness down in the
slopes where the moonlight fell was a bath
of silver and shadows not dead and inky
but blue and living but happy spradling
keyed to the emotional influences of that
june evening found herself laboring with
a distrait and unresponsive visitor who
made an early excuse for departure

xvii

beyond the goal of getting through
college in three years boone had
planned his future but vaguely he might
seek election to the legislature when he
came of qualifying age and strive upward
from that beginning toward congress and
the larger rewards of a political life for
such a career the law was a necessary
preparation so while he was still in col-
lege he began its reading

  whenever he went home from the uni-
versity he saw happy and in the tacit
fashion of simple souls their neighborhood
fell to speaking of boone and happy as
if the linking of their names was natural
and logical and in local gossip it was
almost as if they were betrothed

  happy had other suitors more than a
few of them indeed drawn to the spradling
house by her beauty aiong those neigh-
borhood creeks from the trickles where
they headed up to the mouths where they
emptied there were few girls who could
hope to compete with her loveliness of sloe-
eyes dusky hair and slender grace of body
but the old wives shook their heads say-
ing-

  happy spradling wouldnt hurt a fly-
but jest ther same shes breakin hearts
right an left because shes mortgaged ter
boone wellver-an shes jest awaitin fer
him

  old cyrus already looked on him as a
son and boone spoke as little of anne
masters as he would have spoken of the
things sealed in masonic secrecy

  happys school was one which arranged
its terms and vacations in accordance with
local exigencies crop planting and gather-
ing had the right of way over text-books
and so it happened that when anne was at
marlin town happy was usually at school
and their ways did not cross

by charles neville buck
romance

  yet each summer too as a man may go
from the provinces to court and yet not
delude himself with the hallucination that
he is a courtier boone went over to marlin
town for every sumpier anne masters
came for a few weeks to visit the father
who held his position there remote from
the things that to his thinking made up
the values of life

  during these periods boone found life a
strange and paradoxical pattern woven of
a web of ecstasy and a woof of torture
since that night when we had dragged
suddenly at his bridle-curb and had told
himself i might as well fall in love with a
star up there in heaven he had never
departed from his resolute conviction that
it would be sheer insanity for him to en-
tertain any thought of anne save that of
the willing and faithful slave who would
joyously have laid his life down for her

  she dominated his world of boyhood
dreams and since he was not deaf to the
talk about himself and cyrus spradlings
gal he wondered if he ought not to tell
happy the whole truth but after long
reflection he shook his head

  it would only hurt happy like telling
her about dreams that come at night of
some sort of heaven where i donf see her
herself

  and so he did not tell her

one day in the spring of the year
when anne was sixteen mrs larry
masters dropped into the office of her
kinsman tom wallifarro to talk over some
small matter of business it was one of
the regrets of the ladys life-a life some-
what touched and frostbitten by bitterness
-that all of her business was small it was
however one of her compensations that
this gentleman gave to her petty affairs as
much care and consideration as to the
major features of his large practice

  my dear observed the colonel irrele-
vantly as he looked at the weary eyes of
the woman who had in her day been an
almost famous beauty you seem wor-
ried you are altogether too young to let
lines creep into your face

  mrs masters laughed mirthlessly

  i have a daughter growing up i am
ambitious for her she has charm grace
breeding-and shes the poor member of a
rich family such things bring wrinkles
around maternal eyes cousin tom

  happily she lives in kentucky the
lawyer reminded his visitor we are yet
provincial enough to think something of
blood even when its not gilded with
money

  yes thank god and thanks to you she
has had educational advantages if larry
had only had business sense-but i cant
talk patiently about larry

  no-i wish you could bring yourself
to think of him more indulgently but-
colonel tom knew the fruitlessness of that
line of counsel so he brushed lightly by
to other topics but that isnt what i
wanted to talk about i think morgan
ought to travel abroad for several months
dont you

  mrs masters sighed there was a
thought in her mind which had long been
there if morgan and anne could be
brought to a fancy for each other her
problem in life would be settled the girl
would no longer be a charity child but
what she said was an amendment to the
original thought

  isnt he a bit inexperienced and head-
strong yet to be turned loose in europe
the colonels eyes twinkled

  i mean to have a checkrein on him
what fashion of checkrein cousin
tom

  i thought said the lawyer offhandedly
since he always surrounded his beneficences
with a show of the casual that it would be
a good thing for anne too now if you and
she and morgan made a european trip
together the responsibility of two ladies
on his hands would steady the youngster
mrs masters almost gasped in her effort
to control her delighted astonishment 
morgan had always thought of anne as a
kid to be teased and badgered and of
himself as a very finished and mature young
gentleman now they would see each
other in a new guise their eyes might be
opened in short the possibilities were
immense

  your goodness to us- she began feel-
ingly but the colonel cleared his throat
and raised a hand in defense against the
embarrassment of verbal gratitude

a month later the three sat in the
salle a manger of the elysee palace
hotel by a window that commanded a view
of the arc de triomphe and many things
had happened among them was the sur-

the tempering
- romance 

prizing discovery by the young man that
while few eyes seemed concerned with him
many turned toward anne and having
turned lingered

  only last night they had been to a dance
and anne had been so occupied with uni-
forms that she had found no time to waltz
with him though he was sure that he
danced circles about these stiff-kneed
gentry with petty titles

  now over the petit dejeuner he took his
young and inconsiderate cousin to task

  last night anne i camped on your
trail all evening and you couldnt manage
to slip me in one dance nothing would
do but goggling britishers and smirking
frog-eaters im getting jolly well fed up
with these foreigners

  anne lifted her brows but her eyes
sparkled mischief

  oh morgan i can dance with you any
time she assured him youre just kin-
folks is it because youre jolly well fed
up with foreigners that you like to ape
english slang

  the young man blushed hotly but he
chose to ignore the question with which
she had capped her response inasmuch as
it was a fair hit he had need to ignore it
but his eyes snapped with furious indig-
nation

  anne i dont understand you he an-
nounced in a carefully schooled voice
you can play with absurd little dignitar-
ies or with mountain illiterates-anything

abnormal-but for your own blood-

  he paused there a moment searching his
abundant and sophomoric vocabulary for
the exact combination of withering words
and while he hesitated she interrupted in a
tone which was both quiet and ominous

   lets take up one thing at a time mor-
gan just who is the illiterate in the
mountains

  you know as well as i do-boone
wellver

  boone wellver i thought so at all
events hes a man even if hes not quite
twenty-one yet

  a man that is to say a specimen of
genus homo so is the fellow that brought
in the eggs just now so is the chap that
drives the taxi

  the young aristocrat shrugged his
shoulders and snapped his fingers in ex-
cellent imitation of gallic expressiveness
then as annes twinkle reminded him of his

being jolly well fed up with foreigners
the change of his tone became as abrupt
as the break in a boys altering voice and
he added

  the point is that hes hardly a gentle-
man i commend his ambition but theres
something in birth as well unless you
attach some importance to the elegances
and nuances of life you are only a member
of the mob

  the elegances of life-as for instance
the dancing sparkle stole mischievously
back into the blue eyes and the voice took
on a purring softness as for instance the
handling of the small sword-or fencing
foil

 morgan rose petulantly from the table
and pushed back his chair

  if you ladies will excuse me he an-
nounced with super-dignity i will leave
you for a while to your own devices

  annes laughter pursued him in exit with
an echo of musical mockery

  but that evening mrs larry masters
posted a letter to colonel tom wallifarro

  morgan has discovered anne she said in
part he has been too close to her until now
to realize her attractiveness but she has been
noticed by other men and at last morgan is
awake they have quarreled and next to making
love thats the most significant of developments
my dear kinsman and benefactor you know what
our mutual hope has been and i think its fulfil-
ment is not so far away  tonight when i sipped
my claret at dinner i drank a silent toast-to
my girl and your boy 

  while mrs masters was writing that
note her daughter was sitting at another
desk in the same room and her letter was
addressed to a postoffice back of cedar
mountain

  when boone received that second mis-
sive he turned the envelope over in his
hand and gazed at it for a long while
even then he did not open it until he sat
alone in a place where the forests were
silent save for the call of a blue-jay and the
diligent rapping of a cock of the woods
who was sapping and mining for grubs

  the boy held between thumb and fore-
finger an envelope of a sort he had never
seen before of thin outer paper over a
dark colored lining in one corner was a
stamp of the french republic and there
in writing that had crossed the sea was his
name and address

  she found time to write to me he said

by charles neville buck


rapturously to himself and then dropping
intentionally and whimsically into his old
childhood speech he added nodding his
head sagely to a pert squirrel that frisked
its tail near-by-

  shes done wrote me a letter clar from
tother world

  it was that same summer when anne
had gone to europe that boone came back
from college very serious and taciturn and
mccalloway was prompt to guess the
reason

  you went down to louisville didnt
you he inquired as the two sat by the
door-step on the day of the boys return
and boone nodded

  the man did not nag him with questions
his seasoned wisdom contented itself with
smoking on in silence and after a little the
lad jerked back his head

  i reckon you know what took me there
sir 

  the final word came in afterthought
no mountaineer says sir by habit

  a part of that stubborn independence
which is at once the virtue and the fault
of the race balks at even such small meas-
ure of implied deference but boone had
noticed that down below where courtesy
flowers into graciousness the form of ad-
dress was general

  mccalloway responded slowly

  yes i can guess your errand there
how is lie

  the boys eyes gazed off across the slopes
through contracted lids and his voice came
in deliberate but repressed tenseness

  i hunted up colonel wallifarros office
and he went over there with me i reckon
except for that they wouldnt have let me
see him

  he paused and the man thoughtfully
observed-

  no i fancy not

  you go into that jail-house through a
stone door and thers a rough-lookin feller
settin--i mean sitting-there in front of
another door made of iron gratins as thick
as crowbars the place dont smell good

  isnt it well kept inquired mccallo-
way in some surprize and the boy hastily
explained

  i dont mean that it plumb stinks i
reckon its as clean as a jail can be but the
air is stale-even out on the street that
lowland air is flat it dont taste right in
a mans throat asa was reared up here in

these free hills hes like a caged hawk
down there

  the soldier nodded sympathetically
  did he seem well

  he hasnt sickened none but his face
used to be right colorful now its pale-
and sort of gray-like of course a turnkey
went along with us and we didnt talk
with him by himself i reckon he didnt
say none of the things he craved most to
say he was right silent-like

  the boy broke off and for a while the
two sat in silence when boone took up
the thread of his narrative again there was
something like a catch in his throat

  they were pretty polite to us there
they showed us all over the place-they
even took us to the death row there was
a nigger in there that was goin ter be hung
next morning at daybreak i reckon hes
dead now a feller kept walkin back and
forth in front of that cell and an electric
light was burnin there full bright that
nigger neither night ner day could ever git
away from that light they were afraid he
might seek ter kill hisself he come ter
the bars an said howdy white-folks an
then he went back an sat down on the
ledge that he sleeps on

  the recital painfully punctuated with
its frequent pauses halted there it was a
matter of several minutes before it began
again now the voice was labored as if
the speaker were panting for breath and
the careful pronunciation relapsed wildly
into the older and ruder forms of solecism

  they tuck us out an showed us the
cement yard whar the gallows stood it
was painted a sort of brownish red it put
me in mind of dried blood the nigger
could hear the hammers whilest they set
the thing up asa could hear em too
asa lied done seed ther scaffold hisself
through the winder-bars when he exercised
in the corridor but when i looked at the
nigger thets dead by now seemed like it
was asa i saw-with thet lamp glarin in
on him daylight and night-time alike
the voice leaped into a sob-like vehemence
thets what judas money dogged him to
seemed like i couldnt endure it

xvii

so if the time ever came when boone
stood face to faec with saul fulon
it would for all the amendment of his new

the tempering
romance

life be a moment of desperate crisis the
pig-iron of his half-savage beginning had
been made malleable and held promise of
tempered and flexible steel but the metal
was still feudist ore

  mccalloway comforted himself with the
reflection that saul was not likely to re-
turn but did not delude himself into for-
getting that strange perversity which seems
to draw the mountaineer inevitably back
to his crags and woods even in the face of
innumerable perils some day saul might
attempt to slip back and boone would
almost inevitably hear of his coming then
for a day or an hour the lad might relapse
into his old self even to the forgetting of
his pledge such an unconsidered day or
an hour would be enough to wreck his
life

  carefully and adroitly therefore mc-
calloway played upon the softer strings
of life and sometimes to that end he
opened a hitherto closed door upon the
events of his own life and let his protege
look in on glimpses that were sacredly
guarded from othier eyes

  one summer night for example boone
laid down a book and said suddenly

   it tells here about a fellow winning the
star of india and the victoria cross id
love to see one of those medals

  silently mccalloway rose and went over
to the folding desk to come back with his
battered dispatch box he unlocked it and
laid out before the boy not one decoration
but several the ribbons were somewhat
faded now and the metal tarnished but
boone bent forward and his face glowed
with the exaltation of one admitted to
precincts that are sacrosanct for a long
while he studied the maltese cross with its
lion-surmounted crown and its supporting
bar chased with rose-leaves the cross that
bears the queens name for which men
brave death

   beside it lay the oval showing victorias
profile and the gilt inscription on a blue-
enameled margin-heavens light our
guide a star caught it to its white-
edged blue ribbon and that was the cov-
eted star of india

  here before his eyes-eyes that burned
eagerly-were the priceless trifles that he
had never hoped to see the modest gen-
tleman who for his sake had relinquished
fresh honors in china had won them and
until now had never spoken of them but

boone knew that they are not lightly
gained-and that in no way can they be
bought

  a sudden and unaccountable mistiness
blurred his sight

  im obliged to you sir he said seri-
ously i know you dont often show
them

  he had meant to say nothing more than
that but youths questioning urge mas-
tered his resolution so that he put an in-
terogation very slowly half-fearing it
might seem an impertinence

  you told me once sir that i might ask
whatever questions i liked-and that you
would refuse to answer when you felt like
it im going to ask one now but i reckon
i oughtnt to again there was a diffident
pause but the sincere blue eyes were un-
waveringly steady as they met the gray
ones do you reckon sir the day will
ever come when i can know the real name
of the man i owe pretty nigh everything
to

  mccalloway blinked his eyes which this
cub of a boy had a way of tricking into
unsoldierly emotion and resolutely he set
his features into immobility

  no sir im afraid not he answered
with a gruffness that in no way deceived
his questioner mccalloway is as good a
name as any im afraid at all events it
will have to serve to the end

  slowly and gravely the lad nodded his
head

  all right sir he declared it was
just curiosity anyhow the name i know
you by is good enough for me

  but mccalloway was disquietingly
moved he rose and replaced the dispatch-
box on its shelf and after that he paced
the room for a few moments with quick
restive strides then his voice came with
an impulsive suddenness

  theres a paper in that dispatch-box
that would answer your question boone
he said i tell you because i want you to
realize how entirely i trust you its the
secret chamber of my bluebeard establish-
ment while i live it must remain locked
after a moment he added

  if i should die and you still want to
know then you may open the box but even
then what you learn is for yourself alone
and i want that you shall destroy all those
documents and whisper no word whatever
of their contents to any living soul

  i promise sir declared the boy on
my honor

when august had brought the yellow
masses of the goldenrod and the
rusty purple of the ironweed when the
thistles were no longer a sting to the touch
but down drifting along the lightest breeze
two horses stopped at mccalloways fence
and a girls voice called out

  can we come in

  boone had not known that anne mas-
ters was back on this side of the atlantic
nor had he ventured to hope that she would
find time to come up here into the hills
before the summer ended but the voice
had brought him out to the stile as swiftly
as a cry for help could have done now he
stood looking up at her as she sat in her
saddle with a blaze of worship in his blue
eyes that went far to undo all the self-
restraint with which he had so studiously
hedged about his speech and manner
surprize has undone many wary generals
so his eyes made love to her even while
his lips remained guarded of utterance

  i didnt have any idea that you were
on this side of the world he declared
its just plumb taken my breath away
from me to see you sitting right there on
that horse

  larry masters had dismounted and was
hitching his mule now he turned to in-
quire-

  wheres mr mccalloway

  the boy had momentarily forgotten the
existence of his patron he had forgotten
all things but one and now he laughed
with guilty realization

  i reckon ill have to ask your pardon
sir i was so astonished that i forgot to
tell you he wasnt here hes gone fishing
-and im afraid he wont be back before
sundown

  well weve ridden across the mountain
and were tired if you dont mind well
wait for him

  anne reached down into her saddle-
bags and produced a small neatly wrapped
package

  i brought you a present she an-
hounced with a sudden diffidence and boone
remembered how once before as he stood
by a fence she had spoken almost the
same words then too she had been look-
ing down on him from the superior posi-
tion of one mounted he wondered if she

remembered and in excellent mimicry of
his old boyish awkwardness he said

  thet war right charitable of ye hits
ther fust present i ever got from acrost
ther ocean-sea

  annes laugh rippled out and she fol-
lowed suit quoting herself from the mem-
ory of other years

   oh no it isnt that at all please dont
think its charity

  then she slid down and watched him as
he unwrapped and investigated his gift-
a miniature bust of bonaparte the con-
querer in parian marble the light au-
gust breeze stirred the curls against her
cheeks with a delicate play but they stirred
against the boys heart with the power of
lightning and tornado

  anne was at her fathers house for sev-
eral weeks and scarcely a day of that
time did her vassal fail to ride across the
mountain but those hours squandered to-
gether were fleet of wing mccalloway
smiled observantly and held his counsel

  the charm and gaiety of annes bright
personality would do ijiore to dispel the
menace of gloom from the dark corners of
the boys nature where tendencies of mel-
ancholy lurked than all his own efforts
and wisdom later there would come an
aftermath of bitter heartache for between
them lay the fortified frontier which sep-
arates red blood and blue-the demarka-
tion of the contrary codes of jubal and
tubal cain-but at that thought the sol-
dier shrugged his shoulders with a ripe phi-
losophy

  just now the girls influence was pre-
cisely what the lad needed later when
perhaps he needed something else he would
take his punishment with decent courage
and even the punishment would do him
good a blade is not forged and tem-
pered without being pounded between an-
vil and sledge and if boone could not
stand it then boone could not realize the
dreams which mccalloway built for his
future

  the wisdom of middle age can treat as
ephemeral disasters in which first love can
contemplate only incurable scars boone
himself regarded the golden present as an
era for which the whole future must pay
with unrelieved levies of black despair

  it was chiefly as he rode home at night
that he faced this deaths-head future with
young lips stiffening and eyes narrowed



the tempering
r o m a n c e

jn the morning sunlight or through woous
that sobbed with rain he went buoyant
because then he was going toward her and
whatever the indefinite future held in store
he had that day assured with all its rich-
ness

  xone-the-less boone played the game as
he saw it with the guiding instincts of
a gentleman because it was all a won-
derful dream and he was doomed to an
eventual awakening he sealed his lips
against love-making

  anne was taking him for granted he
reasoned he had simply become a local
necessity to a bright nature overflowing
with vital and companionable impulses

  as vassal he gladly and proudly offered
himself and as vassal she frankly and
without analysis accepted him should
he let slip the check upon his control and
go to mooning about love instead of
meeting her laughter with his laughter and
her jest with his jest she would send
him away into a deserved exile

  on the day before anne was to leave
they were on the great pinnacle rock above
slag-face and by now boone had come
to regard that as the lofty shrine where
he had discovered love afterward it
would stand through the years as a spot
of hallowed memories

  anne had been talking with vivacious
enthusiasm of the things she had seen
abroad and boone had followed her with
rapt attentiveness she had a natural gift
for vivid description and he had seemed
to stand with her by moonlight in the ruins
of the coliseum and to look out with
her from the top of cheops pyramid over
the sands of ghizeh and the ribbon of the
nile

  but at last they had fallen silent and
with something like a sigh the girl said-
tomorrow i go back to louisville

  he had forgotten that for the moment
and he flinched at the reminder but his
only reply was

  and in a few days ive got to go back
to lexington i always miss the hills down
there

  her violet eyes challenged him with full
directness-

wont you miss-anything else
boone who was looking at her closed
his eyes he was sure that they would be-
tray him and when he ventured to open
them again he had prudently averted his

gaze but though he looked elsewhere
he still saw her he saw the hair that
had enmeshed his heart like a snare saw
the eyes that held an inner sparkle-which
was for him an altar fire

   im not the sort of feller that can help
 missing his friends he made guarded re-
 ply but his tongue felt dry and unwieldly
 usually people were not so niggardly as
 that with their compliments to anne and
 as she held a half-piqued silence boone
 knew that she was offended so his next
 question came with a stammering incer-
 titude

   you are a friend of mine arent you
 she rose then from the rock where she
 had been sitting and stood there lance-
 like with her chin high and her glance
 averted to his question she offered no
 response save a short laugh the pulses in
 his temples began to throb and once more
 he closed his eyes as one instinctively closes
 them under a wave of physical pain

   boone had made valiant and chivalrous
resolves of silence but he had heard a laugh
touched with a bitterness from lips upon
which bitterness was by nature alien

   anne he exclaimed in a frightened
tone what made you laugh like that
then she wheeled and her words came
torrentially there was anger and per-
plexity and a little scorn in her voice
but also a dominant disappointment

   i mean borne wellver that i dont
know how to take you sometimes i think
you really like me-lots not just lumped
in with everybody that you can manage
to call a friend i have no use for luke-
 warm friendships id rather have none
at all you seem to be in deadly fear of
spoiling me with your lordly favor

   the boy stood before her with a face
that had grown ashen it seemed incred-
ible to him that she could so misconstrue
his attitude-an attitude based cn hard
and studied self-control

   you think that do you he inquired
in a low voice almost fierce in its intensity
do you think im fool enough not to
take thankfully what i can get without cry-
ing for the moon

   what has the moon to do with it 
she demanded

   but the vow of silence which boone
had taken with the grave solemnity of a
trappist monk was no longer a dependable
bulwark the dam had broken

by charles neville buck


r o m ance

  just this he said soberly youre
as far out of my reach as the moon itself
you say i seem afraid to tell you that i
really like you i am afraid im so
mortally afraid that id sworn id never
tell you god knows that i couldnt start
talking about that without saying the
whole of it i cant say i like you be-
cause i dont like you-i love you i love
you like- the rapid flood of words
broke off in abrupt silence then the boy
raised his hands and let them fall again
in a gesture of despair there isnt any-
thing in the world to liken it to he de-
clared

  annes eyes had widened in astonish-
ment she said nothing at all and boone
waited steeling himself against the ex-
pected sentence of exile nothing less than
banishment he had always told himself
could be the penalty of such an outburst

  now he continued in a bitter despera-
tion ive done what i said id never do
ive foresworn myself and told you that i
love you i might as well finish because

i	reckon i can guess what youll say pres-
ently from the first day when you came
here ive been in love with you ive never
seen the evening star rise up over the kain-
tuck ridges that i havent looked at it
and thought of it as your own star ive
never seen it either that i havent said to
myself you might as well love that star
and ive tried just to live from hour to hour
when i was with you and not think about
the day when youd be gone away

  anne still stood with wide and question-
ing eyes but no anger had come into them
yet her voice shook a little as she asked

  just why do you think of me that way
boone why am i-so far-out of
reach

  why his question was an exclama-
tion of amazement youve seen that
cabin where i was born havent you you
know what your people call my people
dont you-poor white trash between
you and me theres a gorge two hundred
years wide your folks are those that
won the west and mine are those that fell
by the roadside and petered out and dry-
rotted

  as -he finished the speech which had
been such a long one for him he stood wait-
ing into the unsteady voice with which
she put her last question he had read the
reserve of controlled anger such as a just

b	the tem

judge would seek to hold in abeyance until
everything was said so he braced himself
and tried not to look at her but he felt 
that the length of time she held him in
that tight-drawn suspense was a shade cruel
-unintentionally so of course

  the girls face told him nothing either 
at first but slowly into the eyes came that i
scornful gleam that he had sometimes seen 
there when he sought to modify the risk 
involved in some reckless caprice of her
own suggesting a disdain for all things cal-
culatedly cautious at last she spoke

  you could say every one of those things
about lincoln was her surprizing pro-
nunciamento you couidsay most of
them about napoleon or any big man that
won out on his own when i brought you
that little bust i thought youd like it

i	thought you had that same kind of
sdirit-and courage

 but anne-

  i didnt interrupt you she reminded
him my idea of a real man is one who
doesnt talk timidly about gorges whether
theyre two hundred years wide as you
call it or not napoleon wouldnt have
been let into a kitchen door at court so
he came in through the front way with a
triumphal arch built over it he knocked
flown barriers and got what he wanted
then- his voice rang out suddenly
then if i can ever get up to where you
stand i wont be poor white trash to
you

  she shook her head and her eyes glowed
with invincible spirit

  youll be a man that wasnt faint-
hearted she told him honestly one
that was brave enough to live his own life
as i mean to live my own

  anne he said fervently you asked
me if id miss anything but the hills ill
miss you-like-all hell-because i love
you like that

  they were on a mountain-top with no
one to sec them they were almost chil-
dren and inexperienced they thought
that they could lay down their own plans
and build their lives in accordance with
no deflection of time or circumstance

  a few moments later they stood flushed
with the intoxication of that miracle that
makes other miracles pallid the girls
breath came fast and her cheeks were
pinkly flushed the boys heart hammered i
and the leagues of outspread landscape a

per ng
seemed a reeling whirling but ecstatically
beautiful confusion their eyes held in a
silent caress and for them both all subse-
quent things were to be dated from that
moment when he had impulsively taken
her in his arms and when she had returned
his first kiss

general basil prince sat in his

law office one murky december morn-
ing of the year  it was an office
which bespoke the attorney of the older
generation and about it hung the air of
an unadorned workshop if one compared
it with the room in the same building where
young morgan wallifarro worked at a fiat-
topped mahogany table one found the dif-
ference between spartan simplicity and
sybarite elegance but over one bookcase
hung an ancient and battered cavalry
sword a relic of the days when the general
had ridden with the wizards of the saddle
and the saber

  just now he was for the second time
reading a letter which seemed to hold for
him a peculiar interest

  dear general

  your invitation to come to louisville and meet
at your table that coterie of intimates of whom
you have so often spoken is one that tempts
me strongly-and yet i must decline

  you know that my name is not mccalloway
and you do not know what it is i think  made
myself clear on that subject when you waived
the circumstance that i am a person living in
hermitage because my life has not escaped cloud-
ing you generously accepted my unsupported
statement that no actual guilt tarnishes the name
which i no longer use yet despite my eagerness
to know those friends of yours those gentle-
men who appeal so strongly to my imagination
and admiration i could not in justice to you
or to myself permit you to foist me on them
under an assumed name i have resolved upon
retirement and must stand to my resolution the
discovery of my actual identity would be painful
to me and social life might endanger that

  ill not deny that in the loneliness here par-
ticularly when the boy is absent there are times
when for the dinner conversation of gentlemen
and ladies i would almost pawn my hope of
salvation there are other times and many
when for the feel of a saber-hilt in my hand for
the command of a brigade or even a regiment i
would almost offer my blade for hire-almost
but not quite

  i must however content myself with my ex-
periment-my wolf-cub

  you write of my kindness to him but my
dear general it is the otherwav about it

i

i he who has made my hermitage endurable-
and filled in the empty spaces of my life my
fantastic idea of making him the american who
starts the pioneer and ends the modern begins
to assume the color of plausibility

   i now look forward with something like dread
to the time when he must go out into a wider
avorld for then i can not follow him i shall
have reached the end of my tutorship i do not
think i can then endure this place without him
but there are others as secluded

   my dear general the very cordial tone of
your letters emboldens me to ask a favor and
it is a large one in this connection when he
has finished his course at college i should like
to have him read law in louisville that will
take him into a new phase of the development
i have planned he will need strong counsel and
true friends there for he will still be the pioneer
with the rough bark on him coming into a land
of culture and though he will never confess it
he will feel the sting of class distinctions and
financial contrasts

   there he will see what rapid transitions have
left of the old south and despite the many
changes there still survive much of its spirit
its fragrant bouquet its fine traditions are not
yet gone god willing i hope he will even go
further than that and later know the national
phases as well as the sectional-but that of course
lies on the knees of the gods

  general prince laid down the letter and
sat razing thoughtfully at the scabbarded
saber on the wall then he rose from his
chair and went along the corridors to a
suite legended wallifarro banks  wal-
lifarro the general paused to smile for
the last name had been freshly lettered
there and he knew that it meant a hope
fulfilled to his old friend the colonel his
sons name was on the door and his son
was in the firm but it was to the private
office of colonel tom that he went and
the colonel shoved back a volume of decis-
ions to smile his welcome

  torn began the general i have a
letter here that i want you to read i
may be violating a confidence but i think
the writer would trust my judgment in
such a matter

  tom wallifarro read the sheets of evenly
penned chirography and as he handed
them back he said musingly

  under the circumstances of course it
would not be fair to ask if you have any
guess as to who mccalloway is-or was
he struck me as a gentleman of extraor-
dinary interest he is a man who has
known distinction

  thats why i came in this morning
tom i want you to know him better and
to co-operate with me if you will about

romance

the boy since the mountain cant come

to mohammed-

we are to go there came the under-
standing response and basil prince nodded

  precisely i wanted you and one or two
others of our friends to go down there 
had in mind an idea that may be foolish-
fantastic even for a lot of old fellows like
ourselves-but none-the-less interesting
i want to give the chap a dinner in his
own house

  colonel wffllifarro smiled delightedly as
he gave his ready sanction to the plan

  count me in general and call on me
wherever you need me

  it was not until january that the sur-
prize party came to pass and basil prince
and tom wallifarro had entered into their
arrangements with all the zest of college-
boys sharing a secret out of an idea of
simple beginnings grew elaborations as the
matter developed until there was indeed
a dash of the fantastic in the whole matter
and a touch too of pathos

  because of mccalloways admission that
at times his hunger for the refinements of
life became a positive nostalgia the plot-
ters resolved to stage for that one evening
within the walls of hewn logs an environ-
ment full of paradox

  results followed fast a hamper was
filled from the cellars of the pendennis
club old hams appeared cured by pri-
vate recipes that had become traditions
napery and silver-even glass-came out
of sideboards to be packed for a strange
journey all these things were consigned
long in advance to larry masters at mar-
lin town where railway traffic ended and
jolt wagon transportation began

  aunt judy fugate celebrated in her day
and generation as a cook became an acces-
sory before the fact in her house only
a whoop and a holler distant from that
of mccalloways she received with a
bursting importance and a vast secrecy a
store of supplies smuggled hither far more
cautiously than it had ever been needful
to smuggle blockade licker

  upon one pivotal point hinged the suc-
cess of the entire conspiracy

  larry masters must persuade mccallo-
way to visit him for a full day before the
date set and must go back with him at the
proper time the transformation of a log
house into a banquet-hall demands time
and non-interference but there was no

default in masters co-operation and on
the appointed evening mccalloway and
larry rode up to the door of the house
and dismounted then the soldier halted
by his fcnce-line and spoke in a puzzled
tone

  strange-very strange that there should
be lights burning inside ive been away
forty-eight hours and more i dare say
aunt judy has happened in she has a
key to the place

  larry masters hazarded no explanatory
suggestion the vacuous expression upon
his countenance was perhaps a shade over-
done but he followed his host across the
small yard to his door

  on the threshold mccalloway halted
again in a paralyzed bewilderment per-
haps he doubted his own sanity for a mo-
ment because of what he saw within

  the center of the room was filled with
a table not rough as was his own but
snowy with damask and a-sparkle with
glass and silver under the softened light
of many candles so the householder stood
bewildered pressing a hand against his
forehead and as he did so several gentle-
men rose from chairs before his own blaz-
ing hearth when they turned to greet
him he noticed with bewilderment that
they were all in evening dress

  basil prince came smilingly around the
table with an outstretched hand and an en-
lightening voice

  since i am the original conspirator
sir i think i ought to explain we are
a few mohammeds who have come to the
mountain our designs upon you embrace
nothing more hostile than a dinner-party
for a moment victor mccalloway for
years now a recluse with itching memories
of a life that had been a-throb with ac-
tion and vivid with color stood seeking
to command his voice his throat worked
spasmodically and into the eyes that had
on occasion been flint-hard with stern-
ness came a mist that he could not deny
he sought to welcome them-and failed
rarely had he been so profoundly touched
and all he succeeded in putting into words
and that in an unnatural voice was

  gentlemen you must pardon me if i
fail to receive you properly i have no
evening clothes

  but their laughter broke the tension
and while he shook hands around thinking
what difficulties must of necessity have



the tempering

been met in this gracious display of cor-
diality moses the negro butler from the
wallifarro household appeared from the
kitchen door bearing a tray of cocktails

  it was not until after two keenly effer-
vescent hours of talk laughter and dining
when the cigars had been lighted that
prince came to his- feet

  gentlemen he said i am not going
to pledge the man who is both our host
and guest of honor because i prefer to
propose a sentiment we can all drink
standing including himself i give you the
success of his gallant experiment-the boy
boone wellver-a toast to the native-
born 

  they rose amid the sound of chairs
scraping back and once more mccalloway
felt the contraction of his throat and the
dimness in his eyes

  gentlemen he stammered i am
grateful i think the boy is going to
be an american not only a hillsmannot
even only a kentuckian or a southerner-
though god knows either would be a proud
enough title-but an american who blends
and fuses these fine elements that at
all events is my hope and effort

  he sat down hurriedly-and yet in
other days he had spoken with polished
ease at tables where distinguished men and
women were his fellow-diners-and it was
then that tom wallifarro rose

  this was not to be a formal affair of
set speeches he announced in a conversa-
tional tone but there is one more senti-
ment without which we would rise leaving
the essential thing unsaid some one has
called these mountain folk our contempo-
rary ancestors- men of the past living in
our day this lad is in that sense of an
older age when tie goes into the world
he will need such advisors of the newer
age as he has had here in mr mccallo-
way-or at least pale imitations of mr mc-
calloway whose place no one can fill we
are here this evening for two pleasant pur-
poses to dine with our friend who could
not come to us and to found an informal
order the boone who actually lived two
centuries ago was the godfather of ken-
tucky

  gentlemen i give you the order of our
own founding tonight-the godfathers of
boone

  it was of course by coincidence only
that the climax of that evenings gathering
should have been capped as it was prob-
ability would have brought the last guesls
whom no one there had expected at any
other time but perhaps the threads of
destiny do not after all run haphazard
possibly it could only be into such a fan-
tastic pattern that they could ever have
been woven

   at all events it was that night they came
the two short men with narrow eyes set
in swarthy oriental faces such as those
hills had not before seen

  there was a shout from the night-the
customary mountain voice raised from afar
as the guide who had brought these visitors
halloed from the roadway

  im omer maggard an im guidin a
couple of outlanders thet wants ter see
ye

  mccalloway went to the door and
opened it and because it was late the
guide turned back without crossing the
threshold

  but the two men who had employed his
services to conduct them through the night
and along the thicketed roads entered
gravely and though they tbo must have
felt the irrational contrasts of the picture
there their inscrutible almond eyes mani-
fested no surprize

  they were japanese and as both bowed
from the hips one inquired in unimpeach-
able english-

  you are the honorable yictor mccal-
loway

  if the former soldier had found it im-
possible to keep the mists of emotion out
of his pupils a little while ago such was
no longer the case his glance was now
as stern in its inquisitorial questioning as
steel it was not necessary that these
gentlemen should state their mission to
inform him that their coming carried a
threat for his incognito but he answered

  i am so called

  i have the honor to present the count
oku-and myself itokai

the little green devils

by james francis dwyer

the broadway subway trains
running northward take a sud-
den leap out of their black bur-
row when they get up near man-
hattan street and apparently much to
their own surprize rush along for a few
hundred yards in the full light of day
riding the high trestles they roar noisily
palpably endeavoring to attract attention
to their elevated position but the dark
tunnel again springs up before them and
with a strange purring sound that might
be construed into a note of thankfulness
they disappear into the darkness

  one can make curious comparisons with
the broadway trains poets politicians
actors authors pugilists pragmatists par-
sons et al imitate the trains they bur-
row for years in a darkness lit only by
the dim lights of ambition then suddenly
they roar into the limelight prance for
a moment upon the high trestles of fame
then on into oblivion a little unlike the
trains though they never come back

  but and here we come to the subject of
this story there are gems in the world-
great and wonderful gems with careers
analogous to the subway trains they are
what the big jewelers call unpedigreed
gems at long long intervals they appear
upon the market carrying with them no
history of their wanderings and they ex-
cite suspicion they are spoken of in
whispers their value depreciates they
become the magdalenes of the trade very-
beautiful without a doubt but they are
not listed correctly in the whos who

that rival that of caesars wife two such
outlaws are the little green devils

rederick oswald barnard
the original f  b of detroit
michigan knew a little of outlaw gems
when the small tatar with the micro-
scopic brow and the eyes in which terror
danced on pin-points of light called upon
him old f o b was in his own suite at
the grand hotel des wagons-lits in
pekin and the undersized tatar had been
brought to the rooms by two fat and im-
portant chinamen who had much difficulty
in keeping him there

  a wild suspicious bird was the tatar
he pulled his sheepskin coat tighter and
watched every movement of f o b the
secretary and the two men who had in-
troduced him he was taking no chances
with the company and he did not conceal
his distrust old barnard who indexed
every person at first sight and never al-
tered the entry spoke to his secretary in
a whisper when the tatar was being cajoled
to enter the reception room

  if i had a billion for every throat that
little hound has cut he growled id
buv up every libertv-loan bond in the
u s

  and youd have a little left then sir 
murmured the secretary

  the largest and more elaborately robed
of the two chinamen introduced the tatar
gripping him firmly by the collar as he
spoke

  this is the man your excellency he
said speaking psrfect english they are
now with him
romance

  very good said the man from detroit
take no notice of me go ahead in your
own little way and make him put his goods
upon the table im ready to examine
them i have an expert in the next room
the two chinamen did proceed in their
own way the smaller poured out a
stream of unintelligible abuse upon the
tatar but the owner of the sheepskin coat
drew that article tighter around his lean
body and whined curiously

  he wants all the doors and windows
locked and bolted explained the big
chinaman he is afraid of the friends
of the little green devils

  what friends asked old f o b
friends we can not see said the
chinaman gravely the friendsof the
air that they know

  barnard spoke to his secretary

  let kuhn in here he said then bolt
the doors

  the secretary brought the expert a tall
lean and very solemn person who like
all experts looked as if he thought a trap
was being constructed into which it was
hoped he would fall and smash his care-
fully built-up reputation he mistrusted
the yielding carpet the three orientals
the quick sure-footed secretary he
clutched the magnifying glass in his coat
pocket it was the only thing upon which
he relied implicitlj	x

  xow said barnard smiling at the
two chinamen the little set is ready
shoot 

  again the smaller of the two celestials
spoke hurriedly to the tatar whose sus-
picions were evidently not completely al-
layed the appearance of the expert had
startled him but at last convinced that
kuhn was not dangerous he thrust his
hand within the hairy sheepskin jacket and
drew forth a ball of the thick knot-cov-
ered linen they make on the hand looms
in the northern provinces he unrolled it
with fierce quick gestures tearing off the
last yard of wrapping to the accompani-
ment of a little crooning song then with
a flourish he laid something down upon
the teakwood table

  the heads of kuhn f o b the secre-
tary and the two chinamen came slowly
forward drawn by the invisible halters of
a curiosity that strangled nonchalance and
a choking silence came into the room

  it was the big chinaman who broke
the stillness

  those your excellency he said ad-
dressing frederick oswald barnard are
the little green devils

  old f o b looked at the two china-
men the expert the secretary - and the
small-eyed tatar who still held high the
linen bandage as if threatening the things
upon the table then f o b laughed
in a queer strained manner

  just so he murmured just so
well we might-we might get down to
business

  the secretary looked at his chief he
had seen barnard take over a three-mil-
lion-dollar business without the least ex-
citement now his chief was stammering
like a youth making his first investment

  the long fingers of kuhn went slowly
out and clutched one of the little grec-n
devils he brought it toward the magni-
fying glass and thrust it beneath it a
careful man was kuhn he had been
brought to the wagons-lits to examine a
pair of ear-rings whose value was enor-
mous and he intended to do the work thor-
oughly very slowly very carefully with-
out bestowing a glance or a word upon
the others he made his examination sub-
mitting the stones to careful tests scrut-
inizing them intently for flaws

  after a long long tifne he pushed the
pair back to the center of the table frowned
as if their flawless beauty still puzzled him
put his glass back into his coat-pocket and
whispered softly into the ear of barnard
who had lowered his head to receive the
report

  old f o b straightened himself and
signaled the secretary

  go and ask miss stephanie to come
here he said it is silly to buy them
unless she likes them

  the tatar immediately intimated that
the gems should be covered while the door
was open and kuhn placed a jade bowl
over them lowering it gently reluctantly
on the little bed of green fire that burned
in the center of the black table kuhn
loved them and yet with the curious men-
tal twist of the detector of flaws he hated
them beauty is detestable to the critic
the skilful vice investigator dislikes the
spotlessly pure who offer no opportunities
to the art of spying

  as it is impossible to describe the fire

and deviltry of the wonderful gems so
also must the beauty and sweetness of
stephanie barnard be left to the readers
imagination -yuan shih-kai who had a
quick tongue said upon seeing stephanie
barnard

  then the american beauty is not a
flower i am a fool because i always
thought it the name of a rose

  she came into the room looking a little
startled a little afraid showing in her
gentle movements a belief that she was a
little out of place and she certainly was
the room when she entered it was charged
with a peculiar hectic atmosphere brought
about by the presence of the gems but
the entry of the girl brought a soothing
quieting effect the secretary who was
the most self-possessed of the six men
noted the immediate effect her arrival had
upon old f o b barnard was a little
wrought up after his first glimpse of the
gems but the coming of his daughter acted
like a charm he pulled himself together
obtained control of his face and brought
back to his voice the quiet firm timbre
that momentary excitement had destroyed

  stephanie he said pointing to the
jade bowl we have here a pair of stones
that i thought you might like

  kuhn lifted the bowl and the girl with
exquisite grace moved forward and leaned
over the little bed of green fire all
watched her even the half-crazed tatar
stopped tugging at his sheepskin coat and
stared at the lovely face and the splen-
didly graceful throat the latter showing
to advantage as the girl leaned forward
to examine the gems

  the men sensed their own queerness in
her presence kuhn the expert felt a
little ashamed of his morbid hatred of the
gems-a hatred born of his inability to
detect a flaw in their matchless beauty
the two chinamen endeavored to crush
the greed that broke down the barriers of
celestial stoicism and paraded boldly upon
their faces the featherweight intellect
of the tatar worked manfully to keep his
fingers from the suffering sheepskin coat

  for fully five minutes the girl stared at
the gems without speaking then with a
look of absolute amazement tinged with
something akin to supernatural fear upon
her beautiful face she turned to her father

  oh daddy she cried i-i have
never seen anything so wonderful they

	the l i ttle g

are so strange that they make me just a
little-just a little afraid of them
barnard laughed softly then stepped
forward and patted her little white hands

  im glad you like them stephanie
he said i am going to buy them for
you as a birthday present mr kuhn
has just examined them and he thinks the
stones are perfect

  kuhn who at the moment had his sus-
picious glance still upon the gems as if
his eyes were unable to believe in the
absolute flawlessness of the little green
devils turned quickly and bowed to the
girl

  they are without equal he said
grudgingly i have never seen such
stones i have heard of these heard of
them years and years ago when i was at
canton but i thought the story that was
told to me was something from a childs
fairy-book they told me then that the
gems possessed some strange power

  the larger of the two chinamen seized
the opportunity to air his knowledge he
stroked his fat throat patted his silken
vestlet and addressed stephanie

  they have a power as this gentleman
observes he said his voice as oily as
his moon-shaped face it is an extra-
ordinary power it can be obtained by
those who own them and then only at
the expense of the gems it is so my
lady if any person who owns these beau-
tiful jewels should desire something very
very much they must throw the gems
away throw them away in a manner which
to them makes recovery impossible

  he stepped closer to stephanie barnard
and lowered his voice

  it is said he whispered and i who
am a fool know not how true it is that
the glorious empress dowager of china
once owned these stones yes yes she
and again i speak from hearsay flung them
into the yangtze-kiang from the window
of her palanquin when she was crossing
the river on her way to peking she
wanted a throne and she was willing to
sacrifice everything 

  oh murmured the girl and how
were they recovered

  by a fisherman beneath the bridge
answered the narrator the gems must
be tied together before they are thrown
away and as they came through the air
they made an arc of green fire which the

reek devils
romance

fisherman saw he thought a god was
falling from the heavens and he flung out
his hand-net and into it fell the gems the
people who wonder at the circumstances
that brought an unknown woman to the
throne of china know nothing of the lit-
tle green devils

  the narrators countryman nodded his
head viciously as if his forehead was a
hammer that drove the nails of truth into
the story after he had performed this
work to his own satisfaction he decided to
add further glory to the gems

  there was a girl at tai-ping he be-
gan his voice full and sonorous a girl
to whom a rich merchant of nanking had
done a dreadful wrong and this girls
father bought the little green devils
from the fisherman who caught them as
they fell from the bridge the father
gave the jewels to the girl as a wedding
present but the girl knew that there would
be no wedding and in the madness that
came upon her she held up her hands to
the sky and offered the little green devils
for the rich mans heart

  she flung the gems from the edge of
a great cliff o beautiful lady first tying
them together with a lock of her hair and
then went her way home but on her
way she came to a place where a robbery
had been committed some one had killed
a merchant the girl knelt down and
looked at the battered face and lo it was
the face of her lover and his heart the
heart for which she had offered the gems
was nailed to a tree near-by 

  oh how dreadful gasped stephanie
how horrible

  i tell it to show the power of the gems
said the chinaman they have great
power when the girl flung them from the
cliff they fell at the feet of the man who
murdered the merchant and who was even
then fleeing down the side of the moun-
tain and he brought them to my partner
and me listen lady the murderer is in
this room but do not look at him he
has cut many throats and he would cut
mine too if he knew what i am telling
you

  stephanie barnard tried hard to keep
her splendid eyes from surveying the per-
son in the sheepskin coat but she failed
and the tatar catching her frightened
glance felt sure that the chinaman had
been dragging his iniquities into the light

his little ferret eyes flashed malignantly
and the low brow was transformed into
three furrows of hate

  it was barnards secretary who averted
a breach of the peace he presented a
great bundle of bills to his master and the
sight of the money made the tatar forget
the chinaman he became a whining
money-mad pariah his hairy hands out-
stretched to f o b and his yellow teeth
made a peculiar clicking sound as fred-
erick oswald barnard counted the bills
into his hands the two chinamen smiled
as they received their commission then
kuhn the expert took up the little green
devils and passed them to barnard who
handed them to stephanie

  the tatar going out the door his
money hidden beneath his sheepskin coat
spoke rapidly to the larger of the two
chinamen and the chinaman translated
to stephanie barnard

  he says remarked the unsmiling ce-
lestial that the last owner of the gems
got the heart of a dead man in return for
them but it is far better to get the heart
of a live man therefore he says if you
want something great do not delay the
sacrifice of the stones i bid you good
morning my lady

f o b and his beautiful daughter left
 peking two days later stephanie
hugging to her bosom the little green
devils for which her father had paid a
price that was unbelievable she thought
often of the stories which the two china-
men had told of the power they wielded
she visualized both stories they told she
saw the ambitious girl who wished to rule
an empire passing over the yellow yang-
tze-kiang in her palanquin she pictured
her suddenly overcome by the desire to
rule tearing from her ears the wonderful
gems and tossing them into the tumbling
waters

  oh how could she he would murmur
again and again when in the privacy of
her own bedchamber she would study the
carving of the devils the work of some
long-dead eastern lapidary who so it
would seem had made the pattern strange
and intricate with the desire to hold the
gems in his possession for a long long
time i wouldnt throw you away for
a thousand thrones she would cry no
no no

  and she thought often that the cun-
ningly-carved little devils grinned back at
her as if they had heard similar protesta-
tions through the years at times they
looked strangely alive to stephanie won-
derfully old they were those two little
pariahs of the world of gems

  she thought of the other story with a
shudder she wondered what the girl
thought when she came upon the heart for
which she had hurled the gems into space

  but you didnt kill him stephanie
would cry kissing one green emerald and
then with a neither did you kissing
its companion it was the horrid man
in the sheepskin coat that murdered her
lover

  very very childish and believing was
stephanie barnard she had at twenty
the precious power of belief that the years
unfortunately destroy implicitly and
firmly she believed in the power of the
little green devils that she loved

  barnard and stephanie drifted away
over hot scented seas away up to yoko-
hama and then over roads deep with cherry
blossoms they went to nikko it was
stephanies wish to go to nikko

      where the holy come and go

      where the cherry blossoms blow

      where the gods speak soft and low-

         at nikko in the spring

   and at nikko wonderful to relate ste-
phanie barnard of detroit michigan
u s a met a townsman he was paint-
ing there-painting the sanctuaries built
by the great shoguns of the tokugawa
dynasty his name was jack beecher
and way back in a misty beautiful past
way back before frederick oswald bar-
nard had seized opportunity by the fore-
lock and hog-tied the creature by forming
overnight the great american production
 distribution company jack and ste-
phanie had played together in the yards
of two wooden houses in a very unaristo-
eratic neighborhood in old detroit

  and the years rolled away at nikko-
nikko where the old grow young and
where the youthful become children again
jack was poor very poor while stephanie
was dreadfully rich but at nikko worldly
riches do not count the prince prays with
the beggar in the century-old shrines so
jack beecher and stephanie were not aware
of the abyss that separated them as they

strolled around in the sweet stillness and
examined holy places that the little green
hands of the dead years had patted softly

  old f o b noticed but to f o b
nikko was a place where people did un-
conventional things which they viewed
with a shudder when they reached chicago
london detroit or whatever other spot
where their social gods sat in judgment
mr barnards ideas upon art were very
vague some one had once told him that
a great artist had said that art invaded
the hovel of the pauper as well as the pal-
ace of the prince and old f o b with
the story in mind devoutly hoped that it
would dodge his detroit mansion which
was midway from hovel and the palace
but he was kind to stephanie and he let
her have her own way

  the barnards journeyed up to yamagata
and then came back to yokohama where
f o b had engaged the finest suites on
the  s mongolia homeward-bound to san
francieco and it was on the morning
when mr barnard and stephanie rick-
shawed down the bund from the grand
hotel that f o b realized the wisdom of
that old motto which asserts that a stitch
in time saves nine it was while the rick-
shaws were threading a way through the
crowded thoroughfare that stephanies
wonderful eyes found my jack beecher
and mr beecher without being told that
f o b and his daughter were returning
to the united states on the mongolia hur-
riedly announced that he had just been
able to get the last available berth upon
that steamer

  extraordinary luck he ciied amaz-
ing good fortune

  hm said f o b

  i stupidly left it till the last minute
burbled the artist didnt think about
going till the other day then i got home-
sick and all that and packed hurriedly

  quite so said barnard dryly but
its unwise to leave things till the last
moment you should have booked your
berth when we booked ours i wired the
agents from nikko

  you going on the mongolia cried
beecher you and miss stephanie why
that-that is perfectly splendid its
bully

  how amazed he was he said it was
one of the most extraordinary coincidences
that he had ever heard of and although

the little green devils
old f o b gave no manifestations of as-
tonishment stephanie was brave enough
to support beecher in his assertions

  it is a strange happening she stam-
mered her beautiful face warmed with
soft blushes we-we say good-by to you
at nikko and find now that you are going
back to america by the same boat

  old f o b coldly ventured an opinion
regarding the weather and the interview
ended later however as he and ste-
phanie sat upon the deck of the mongolia
he broached the beecher matter

  stephanie he said that young
painter is chasing you

  chasing me daddy

  sure that bronze idol in your cabin
could tell you that ive got no objec-
tion to what he is but i object to what he
does nobody loves an artist at least
no one that has a million and a beautiful
daughter

  but daddy cried stephanie jack

does-

  dont let us quarrel youre a sensible
girl and you know that things that go at
nikko would raise old nick at detroit
its a bad pun girlie but it carries my
meaning

love say the arabs uses the little

	grains of the desert the scents of the
flowers and the breezes of the dawn the
wild doves are the slaves of love and the
date-palm signals messages with its wav-
ing fronds and so as the mongolia
moved eastward the ocean equivalent to
cupids desert helpers brought jack
beecher and stephanie barnard closer to
each other there was little conversation
between them and no meetings that f o
b could frown at but the winds the
sunshine the stars and the blue blue sky
fought against parental control as they
always have fought since the first primi-
tive wench put a chain of red berries
around her neck and crept out of the
sleeping kampong to meet a lover in the
moonlight

  f  b seemed perfectly happy on
the first day out he found in the smoke-
room of the mongolia a dandified person
who seemed to exude wealth and later he
introduced the dandy to stephanie

  the baron rossino he said leading
the dandy to his daughters deck chair

ince

the baron has been in every port in the
world

  the baron admitted unblushingly that
he had traveled extensively and a few
minutes later when f o b went in
search of a steward he pointedly informed
stephanie that in all his travels he had
never seen a vista more beautiful than
the one he was enjoying at that moment
stephanie was uneasy and when the baron
gave a further exhibition of bad taste by
commenting upon the little green devils
she was only too willing to hide her em-
barrassment by telling the story of the
gems

  baron rossino was interested he was
more than interested he asked where
they were purchased and from whom and
after much skilful maneuvering he en-
deavored to find out their value

  i dont know what they are worth
said stephanie then as she glanced at the
little eyes of the baron she was startled
by the light of greed that showed within
them

  i dont like him she told jack
beecher when jack rescued her from the
barons conversational grip i think hes
horrid no american would be half as
impertinent

   the artist gritted his teeth but he said
nothing he had overhead the baron as
he bragged to old f o b in the smoking
room and he realized that the titled per-
son would be his particular bete noire on
the voyage half-formed plans of irritat-
ing the baron sprang into his head he
thought of jumping hard upon rossinos
patent leather shoes of pouring a glass of
liqueur over his glossy black hair he even
thought of a dark night and a quick push
over a deck rail

  for three days the baron rossino de-
voted to stephanie all the time he could
spare from the card-tables a girl in a
deck chair is the victim of a persistent
male and stephanie shuddered at the
dandys approach books were no shield
against him neither was feigned sleep
jack beecher always watchful loafing in
the distance was the girls only salvation

  you promised to walk with me miss
stephanie he would remark sorry
baron to interrupt your story

   old f o b at times regretted his ac-
tion in introducing the baron to his
daughter on the third day out an ameri-

         --aq romance

can cavalry officer had refused to sit in
a card game with the baron at the table
and the baron had not resented the insult

    and then on the fifth night out from
 yokohama a coral reef built by polyps
 through innumerable years was brought
 into the game by daniel cupid this
 uncharted point that had climbed inch by
 inch toward the surface and had cunningly
 evaded those who map the waters of the
 deep drove itself deep into the hull of
 the mongolia and the good ship quivered
 at the thrust the vicious sword that the
 years had made tore a tremendous hole and
 twenty minutes after the vessel struck the
 captain decided that the boats were much
 safer than the unfortunate ship

    jack beecher found stephanie and her
 father on the deck the old man endeavor-
 ing to protect the girl from the feet and
 shoulders of sailors who rushed backward
 and forward to carry out the commands
 that came from the bridge the girl
 was calm and she spoke in a whisper to
 the artist

    would you do me a great great ser-
 vice she asked would you my-
  my ear-rings are in my cabin on the
 dressing-table i-i want them you know
 they have a great power and-and if
 fathers life was in danger-oh jack
 please go and get them please

    the lights went out as jack beecher
 reached the door of stephanies stateroom
 through a darkness that was stifling he
 groped his way toward the dressing-table
 he moved carefully his feet muflled by the
 thick carpet	

    beechers hand touched the table and
  his fingers moved forward gropingly in
  search of the little green devils ste-
  phanie with her childlike belief in their
  power wanted them to save the life of
  her father and he was determined that he
  would get them if he stayed in the cabin
  till the mongolia took her long dive

   slowly carefully the sensitive fingers
  of the artist moved across the table feeling
  each object they touched suddenly the
  fingers of the right hand came in contact
  with something that made beecher quickly
  withdraw his hands and brace himself for
  a shock his fingers had touched a human
  hand a hand that was moving slowly
  across the dressing-table as if its owner
  sought the same objects as the artist

   beecher waited there was absolute

stiliness in the cabin the other occupant
aware of the artists presence was also
awaiting an attack

  for over a minute there was no move-
ment on the part of either then the artist
took a step forward and the step pro-
voked an immediate attack on the part of
the unknown beechers shoe struck the
leg of the table and something heavy evi-
dently a small mirror hurtled by his head
and smashed itself into fragments against
the cabin wall the artist sprang into
the darkness cannoned heavily against a
body braced to receive his attack and the
battle was on

  they fell upon the floor and threshed
around like a pair of gigantic reptiles they
clawed themselves up by the aid of chairs
and tables and fell again to the carpeted
floor because the list of the ship made it
impossible for them to battle while stand-
ing erect

  there was no attempt at science it
was a mad wild rough and tumble fight
in the dark from above and around them
came harsh cries and the patter of feet
the creaking of blocks and the wild clat-
ter of breaking china but they fought in
silence

  they broke apart and for an instant lost
each other beecher leaped forward and
a little fiery shaft of pain struck deep into
his right side he tried to understand
what had happened there was no ex-
plosion so no shot had been fired yet he
was wounded he felt his side and knew
that his fingers were wet wet with blood
and upon the deck stephanie was waiting
for him to bring her the precious gems in
which she had such great faith

  a slight noise came out of a corner of
the cabin and with a howl of rage beecher
sprang he caught the unknown by the
neck thrust him against the cabin wall
then rolled with him to the floor as the
mongolia took a sharp sudden list to port
the other tried to break the grip but the
artist had a death hold he saw stephanie
waiting and his fingers burrowed deeper
into the throat of the robber and would-be
murderer

  the unknowns struggles lessened then
ceased altogether beecher sprang to his
feet and staggered to the dressing-table
hurriedly madly he clawed among the
little silver knick-knacks that littered it
till with a great cry of joy he found the



t h l little crecn devils
little green devils he felt his way to
the door stumbling over the man with
whom he had fought the half-choked
one unloosed an oath and beecher for the
first time knew with whom he had been
fighting it was baron rossino

  on the dark deck of the mongolia he
found stephanie her father and the husky
first officer who was vainly endeavoring to
drag the girl to a boat

  but i must wait for him she pro-
tested i told him to get them and i-
i-

  ive got them gasped beecher
hurry hurry shes going

  it seemed as if the mongolia had waited
for beechers arrival upon deck to make
preparations for her last plunge she
quivered like a cold hound lifted herself
for an instant then slowly settled

  it was every one for himself at that mo-
ment and jack beecher was handicapped
by the fact that three inches of steel had
entered his ribs some few minutes before
clinging to the davit-lines he helped
stephanie into the boat-stephanie clasp-
ing her little green devils down went
barnard and the first officer then as if
dissatisfied with her exit the mongolia
humped her stern suddenly and beecher
faint with loss of blood was thrown from
the ropes into the water

  stephanie screamed as the first officer
shouted out an order the boat was thrust
away from the side of the ship and a sailor
swung a lantern in a circle

  well get him cried the officer hell
come up

  there was an interval of intense quiet
the pacific sucked at the big ship no one
spoke the sailor swung the lantern
monotonously and as the light fell upon
the white hand of stephanie barnard she
opened it and looked at the gems it con-

romance

tained and she saw more than the little
green devils her hand was wet-wet
with blood that was upon the jewels when
beecher handed them to her

  in an instant the girl realized the cause
of his delay below deck with frantic
haste she knotted her tiny lace handker-
chief around the two wonderfully carved
gems and thrust them quickly over the
side of the boat

  a sailor in the bow shouted a warning
and tfye boat shot forward the big first
officer leaned far out and gripped some-
thing two sailors came to his assistance
and jack beecher was dragged into the
boat

  pull away shouted the officer ive
it to her every ounce boys the old
ship is going

  five minutes later jack beecher whis-
pered to stephanie who had managed to
bind up the knife wound

  i did give you your earrings didnt i
he murmured things got a bit mixed
with me after i got that jab but i did
give them to you tell me i did

  yes yes stammered the girl you
gave them to me jack

  show them to me so that i wont think
youre trying to let me down easy he
gasped i-i was a little silly when i
got on deck stephanie but if i saw

them-

  jack she said her face close to his
they-they slipped from my hand a mo-
ment after you fell into the water

  and old f  b of detroit michigan
sitting close to them in the darkness over-
heard it was then that he recalled the
remark of the great whistler about art
entering the hovel of the pauper and the
palace of the prince f o b had a
mighty big idea that the detroit mansion
would house it too

 the field

little girls running up through the grasses
know you the way your footsteps take

    a complete novelette

the day was hot even for july on
the mohave desert and the glare
of the sun on the white sand and
the puffs of scorching air that came
from the bare hills to the south made the
little town of herkomer with its tin shacks
and stores and dobe houses and the station
buildings of dark red an inferno of tor-
ment deserted and desolate

  only dan summers and jim yardley
his partner sat in the shade outside the
saloon and argued

  no jim said dan patiently it aint
right

  and for the second time he refused to
agree to jims proposal

  jims round serious face with the slightly
goggle eyes was very sad dan watched
him and smiled he usually did smile
when he looked at jim for long he found
in his appearance and moods an endless
source of interest and amusement there
were so many things about jim that dan
never understood so many quettions that
he would have liked answered but he
never asked these questions on the desert
one waits to be told one is never curious
openly

  dan wondered why jim yardley a man
of nearly forty fifteen years older than
himself and yet so much younger in ex-
perience and worldly wisdom well-edu-
cated and loathing hardship and toil
should be content to spend his life pros-
pecting what was his past history

  they had little in common jim was

 s

not really a prospector at all nor would
he make one he was wofully ignorant of
rocks and ores he was no hand at man-
aging a burro or running a drill he was
awkward around a camp nevertheless
with all his faults dan knew that no one
could have had a partner to equal jim
he was a responsibility of course he
wanted looking after and guiding always
and never more so than now for dan
realized that the restlessness that came
with the sight of the railroad was on him
once more also he had money poor
silly old jim a good old scout but iust
as simple and innocent as a kid of ten

  for the third time jim began

  dan im tired we sold that gold
bug mine and weve got money-heaps of
money-more than we need to fit up the
next trip danny listen to reason i
want to wear clean clothes an a white col-
lar again if its only for two weeks i
want to feel what its like to have a shave
from a real barber an to sit down to
meals with a linen table-cloth an a waiter
to say sir to you i want to go to a
show an i want-damn it dan i want
to ride in a street-car again thats not
extravagance is it i want to see the
lights at night an hear the crowds in the
street an go visitin friends an danny i
want a drink-a long iced drink danny
im a thirst inside nothin but a ragin
tearin thirst he paused and went on
again very dolefully dont you ever get
tired of the desert dan the heat ar
romance

sun an brush an rocks an snakes an dirt
-an the dodbusted monotony of it all
arent you tired dan

  dan watched a big freight-engine with
its long line of refrigerator fruit-cars puff-
ing slowly away across the desert with the
rails and telegraph wires all vanishing at
the one point on the horizon

  after all thought dan it was hard on
jim-darned hard he had worked well
and he needed a change the worst of it
was once he was off the desert one never
knew quite what damfool trick he would be
up to next and then-dan liked jim
least when he was in a city in store clothes
looking like a commercial traveler and
standing drinks like a millionaire he had
the style all right had old jim no one
had anything on jim when it came to mix-
ing with folks certainly but    

  dan jim was speaking once more
dan for heavens sake lets divvy up
an go into los angeles

  dan sighed

  all right jim but for the love uh
mike take care weve got to keep
some money aint we or else maybe

its a job in a mine again-

  jim shivered

  goshormighty swinging a seven-
pound hammer or mucking out hey not
for this child its all right for you dan

running a mill or a mine hoist-

  i aint so stuck on los angeles myself
jim an yuh know it i guess ill go
down to the beach for a blow from the
ocean an-theres browning i want to
see i aint been in browning for so long
now i almost forget what it looks like

so dan went to browning and stood on
the sidewalk of the main street and
smiled nothing had changed no new
stores had been built brownings busi-
ness section was made up of the same six
buildings as before the post-office and
grocery store the hardware store the pool
room the bank the barbers with its funny
little striped pole and old man newsoms
real-estate office and wherever one
looked north south east west on both
sides of the street and beyond in the midst
of gardens and houses were vacant lots
unsold and unsellable

  the door of the real-estate office opened
and an active little man with gray hair
and a withered face hurried out

  hello dan back again then
howdy mr newsom hows business
boomin said the little man as they
shook hands dan you buy i dunno
if its worth my while tryin to intrest you
in any lots in your home town or an or-
chard maybe but prices are sure goin to
jump

  dan roared

  not on your life he said no real
estate for me mr newsom nothin doin
id as soon bury my mqney in death val-
ley as in browning brownings dead
its the livest corpse you ever seen
then said the little man

  they chatted for a while on the future
before browning and then dan turned
away

  well im goin to visit elmer prescott
see you later mr newsom

  mr newsom grunted

  huh elmers gone ahead in the world
one of our leadin citizens elmer is

elmers house was white with a green-
shingled roof and green shutters and
a wide veranda over which climbed masses
of purple bougainvillea and a sleeping-
porch with red-and-white-striped blinds
and in front was a green lawn-green not
parched and burned like the grass one saw
elsewhere and flower beds and on either
side were tall rustling palm trees and be-
hind was the orchard and a garage and
barns

  dan was impressed this then was
where old elmer lived no wonder mr
newsom had said he had gone ahead
why he must be rich

  elmer was glad to see him no one had
ever been so glad to see any one in the
world before dan would stay the night
of course elmer would take no refusal
he stood in the entrance hall with its
dark floor stained and covered with rugs
laughing and talking boisterously then
he called up the stairs-

  margie come on down an see whats
blown in on us

  whos cornin dan asked

  im married now dan didnt you
hear i married little marjorie james
three months ago margie old man james
daughter you remember margie dont
you dan

  yes said dan slowly i remember
margie

b y w to v nend
romance

  lord alive could he ever forget-to his
dying day could he ever forget every-
thing that would have made life worth
living crumbled into nothingness and he
saw before him a vista of empty years
margie married to elmer what a fool
he had been when he had drifted back
on to the desert without having spoken
he had had hopes he had returned to find
that his hopes were dreams and he
wanted to escape from elmers house to
get right away from everybody and hide
before margie could see him there was
a dull ache in his heart and he felt
wretched and unhappy more unhappy than
he had ever felt before and yet he would
have to stop where he was and smile and
pretend-damn it-that nothing was
wrong and that he was glad elmer was
happy-and so he was glad wasnt el-
mer a friend

  and then margie came down the stairs
dark and pale and slender smiling hap-
pily dressed in white and looking like
some queen out of a story

  why dan she said why its dan
summers she held out both hands
dan we thought you were lost

  they sat in big cane rockers on the
veranda and the two men talked about the
years that had slid by since they had last
met and they told each other what they
had done and seen and where they had
been while the girl watched them in
silence her dark eyes looking first at one
and then at the other as each spoke and
dan glancing at her from time to time so
dainty and fragile and pretty wondered
miserably at himself for having dared to
aim so high

  elmer was full of enthusiasm and
schemes he had done well he would
do better there was in browning a fu-
ture dan smiled no elmer persisted
a big future property would go up and
up he waved his hands in the air and
his wife smiled at him fondly almost as a
mother might smile at a clever child

  im putting up a new store in town
ive got a hay and feed business ive just
bought forty acres cheap-got them away
from under old newsoms eyes land fit for
anything im goin to make big money
dan bags of it i cant help but make it
dan i tell you right now theres possi-
bilities in browning you wouldnt get no-
where else in california aint that so

  she looked at him adoringly

  yes dear you say so and you ought
to know

  elmer shouted

  ho ho ho you get that dan

i	say so an i oughter know i cant do
wrong in margies eyes i just cant look
at her dan aint i the lucky man

  dan nodded yes elmer was lucky
amazingly lucky old elmer who had
never had another idea in his head but the
making of money-and not for elmer the
slow laborious toil of the desert-old el-
mer with all his hustle and speed had yet
found time to win margie lucky yes
what man had ever had such luck as this
and then dan thought of old jim and he
wondered if jim would ever come to him
and say that he was going to be married
   he smiled imagine old jim
yardley tagging around after a skirt-
with a family

  elmer paused in the midst of a descrip-
tion of another of his enterprises

  what are you smiling at dan

  nothin said dan go right ahead
elmer

  and it flashed into his mind for the first
time that elmer was strangely like what
jim would be if jim had no hard work to
do and plenty to eat and a little too much
to drink but then elmer wasnt quite
like jim of course nor could he ever hope
to be elmer for all his qualities missed
it

later when supper was over-and
such a supper-fried chicken and
thick gravy creamed potatoes and sweet
potatoes green peas and salad hot bis-
cuits and butter and strawberry shortcake
and cream and coffee such as dan had
not imagined possible-they sat once more
on the veranda in the soft californian dark-
ness and talked and margie came out
and played pathetic little mexican songs
on a guitar and sang while the grasshop-
pers chirped an obligato and the breeze
whispered in the eucalyptus wrees and the
night was sweet with the scent of orange
blossoms and roses

  finally the girl said that she must go
indoors and then elmer drew his chair
near to dans

  for a long time neither of them spoke
dan sat and smoked and pondered in his
mind on life and all that life brought a

partners
romance pgsaapriq

man with a wife as sweet and true and
tender as margie should be full of grati-
tude no wonder elmer-was ambitious
nothing would be too good for such a wife
as his was elmer himself good enough
could he appreciate-dan put the thought
resolutely away from him

  youre a lucky man elmer he said
finally but you deserve your luck

  its all for that little woman of mine
said elmer everything and now-
what am i faced with he turned and
leaning over the arm of his chair stared at
dan in the darkness dan you aint
guessed then have you

  dan was puzzled

  guessed what he said

  elmer sighed like a man who has en-
dured to the utmost of his strength

  dan im just about broke

  and then elmer in a low voice told him
the truth he had money to pay off on
his home and on most of his lots in brown-
ing his orchards were mortgaged the busi-
ness was only beginning to show a profit
all his spare cash had gone into the build-
ing of his store his forty acres even could
not be his until he had made money enough
to pay off the balance still owing

  an here i am he said a millionaire
maybe in ten-five years from now an
yet wanting twelve hundred the worst way
if i dont find twelve hundred by tomorrow
noon dan i just dont know what will
become of us

  twelve hundred said dan in bewil-
derment

  the balance of twelve hundred theres
people owin me money an wont pay and
old man newsom ses if i dont come across
by tomorrow-you know what he is dont
you

  dan was sorry but why should elmer
expect him to help

  if i was rich id help yuh he said
but i aint old jim yardley my pard-
ner an me come off the desert with a few
hundred dollars between us id let you
have some willing but it wouldnt be fair
to old jim

  elmer agreed but he hadnt meant to
suggest borrowing what he had intended
to imply was that dan might care to in-
vest some of his money in browning prop-
erty

  it aint for my sake that i mind con-
tinued elmer but just think of that

poor little wife of mine trustin in me like
she does-what will she think when she

learns that the homes lost to us-

  he rose from his chair and walked to
the far end of the veranda dan watched
him without moving

  it made him angry a man with a wife
as sweet and pretty as his and he went and
deliberately risked her happiness the
darn fool and he would break her heart
and make her feel that she coud never be-
lieve in her husband again

  oh hell thought dan and was
margie to be made unhappy for the sake
of a few hundred dollars

  it was no business of his of course he
had jim-poor old jim yardley to think
of-and yet

  elmer he called

  elmer walked slowly toward him

  how much is it yuh want exactly to
make up the balance uh what yuh owe
dan could hear elmer draw a deep
breath

  seven hundred dollars said elmer in
a strained voice

ill let yuh have it in the morning
dan said elmer brokenly i dunno
how i can thank you youve put me un-
der a debt that i cant repay youve
saved me an youve saved margie

  dan felt all at once that he no longer
liked elmer quite so much as he thought
he did elmer was too smooth there
was something in his manner that rang
false-just a suspicion that he could not
quite shut out but elmer was a friend
and a man mustnt go back on his friends
whatever happened

and the next morning when dan came
 down to breakfast margie thanked
him for what he had done

  poor elmers been worrying lately she
said and he wouldnt let me know and
last night when he came up-stairs he told
me all about it dan no one could have
done more for a friend than you have
and elmer the picture of health and
prosperity big and jolly and well-dressed
and a trifle florid in appearance added his
thanks and dan felt embarrassed and
ashamed of himself and he wished that he
could have givep the money without
margie knowing from whom it came

  after breakfast he gave elmer a bundle
of bills

     count em he said

     elmer held the wad in his hand

     dan he said i guess youre the best
   man that ever lived well go down-town
   presently an see about them lots of mine
   youre goin to have

     forget it elmer said dan i dont
 want no lots

     dan said the girl dan please if
  you dont we cant take the money

     dan gave in

    in the course of the morning he went
  with elmer to the bank where he was given
  the three deeds duly signed andwitnessed
  and stamped

    now dan said elmer with the air
  of one conferring a kindness these are
  your deeds take great care of them
  them lots you bought are as good bar-
  gains as youre ever likely to get ill send
  the titles on just as soon as ever the trust
  company lets me have em mind you
  tell me your address dan

    dan felt dissatisfied any one would
  have thought that elmer instead of being
  indebted to him had done him a service
  in letting him have three perfectly useless
  lots which he didnt want in exchange for
  seven hundred dollars which he wanted
  very much

    dan spoke to syd turner the cashier
  of the browning state bank

     syd he said look after them deeds
  for me will yuh elmer give the titles to
  syd when they come is that all right
  syd im off to the desert again

    what about taxes dan said the
  cashier are you reckonin on bein away
  for long

     years said dan

     he slapped a couple of bills on to the
  counter

     take these syd an pay the taxes with
   em

    syd nodded and dan saw him glance
  curiously over the brass railing at elmer
  as if wondering how he had managed to
  dispose of lots so worthless as those he had
  sold

     these will pay for the taxes for about
  four years he said aint that too much
  dan

no said dan an if i aint back
here by the end uh four years i guess i
wont be back in browning again ever
he left browning that afternoon for los
angeles

  no elmer he said i cant stay a
minute longer i arranged to meet jim
this evnin an i mustnt fail

  he said good-by to margie on the front
steps of the house

  good-by margie he said if i
hadnt come in to browning again i should
never have known how lucky elmer was
ive seen you margie an i know

  the girl gave a happy little laugh
thank you dan i never knew you
could say such pretty things youll come
and see us again soon wont you

  dan shook his head no on the whole
he did not think that he would he would
be busy out on the desert

  if im anywheres near browning
though ill come sure

  the last impression he had of her-an
impression that was to be with him for
many many days-was a slender figure in
white standing on the green in front of the
house waving to him

  elmer was grateful

  dan he said you helped me more
than you know an dan if you ever find
yourself in need of a helping hand a grub-
stake anything dont you forget elmer g
prescott of browning california

  they shook hands

  an your address said elmer

  aint got one said dan ill write
first

  mr newsom was on the car

  whats this i hear from folks about
you buyin some property in browning
he asked

  dan remembering how he had scoffed
at browning felt uncomfortable

  guess  oughter have bought from you
hey he said

  mr newsom grinned

  not a bit of it dan but what did you
want to buy them two lots on third for
theyre nothin but swamp in winter
after the rains an the business section is
goin to build up right away from where
you bought that other lot-right in the
opposite direction

  then ive been stung is that it said
dan

  i wouldnt like to say that but you
must have been awful eager to buy in
browning dan to buy so quick

  dan didnt care they might think him
crazy if they wanted to but he had helped
a friend out of a tight place and he

partners
r o mance

didnt want the old lols anyway he felt
furious with elmer for having forced them
on to him what did he want with lots in a
place like browning

again and again when prospecting or
 tramping across the burning flats or
in some mining-camp with other men for
contrast it would come over dan how re-
markable jim yardley was beneath the
surface roughness the desert slang the
dirt and grime there was another jim fond
of the good things that life had to offer
those with money self-indulgent perhaps
a heavy spender a heavy drinker but re-
fined and cultured and able to talk on
topics that left dan dizzy

  but never had he been quite so aware
of this difference between jim and all his
other friends as when he met him in los
angeles jim in an old shirt and trousers
and broad-brimmed hat on the desert was
a very different jim from this stout pink
smooth-faced gentleman in the pale-gray
suit and white collar and tan shoes who
greeted him when he arrived but not even
clothes could alter jims smile or the af-
fection in his funny goggle eyes or his voice
or hide the fact that he was worried and
anxious and that later on he would if left
alone reveal some indiscretion or some
fresh cause for worry

  they sat together in the bedroom of the
small hotel that jim had chosen

  dan he said gravely you know that
ive got friends in los angeles dont you
well dan as soon as i arrived i fetched
my box from where i had it stored and put

on my city clothes-

  that theres a new suit said dan
anyways

  i know dan i know but listen-
dan between you an me- jim hesi-
tated and looked uneasy its this way
get a move on said dan

  and so far he was merely amused and
th thought came to him that he had been
wrong and that jim was not in the least
like elmer he was of the same build but
elmer was flabby and soft jim was in
spite of his bulk as hard as nails fit and
strong and active elmer could never have
swung a seven-pound hammer to save his
life

  dan said jim i guess what im go-

ing to say will surprize you im goin
to be married

  dan sprang to his feet

  you idiot you-oh my jerusalem
aint you goin to congratulate me
said jim

  the hell i am said dan lemme
find the girl an tell her howr sorry i am
she got herself tied up to you-you big
stiff married

  jim shifted his weight from one leg to
the other

  well dan you neednt be so damned
rude about it im not marrying into your
family anyhow thank god

  dan sat on his bed with his head in his
hands and his elbows on his knees think-
ing he saw a picture of himself tramping
across the glaring sunlit desert with his
three burros heading for the distant hills
alone-with no one to talk to or listen to
no one to help him in the digging poor old
jim the best partner a man could ever
have   

  and then he jumped up once more and
running across the room to jim beat him
lightly on both cheeks rumpled up his hair
and tugged at his tie and called him names
and otherwise showed him that even after
what had happened they were pals still

  you ornery old toad he said you
old microbe you go an get yourself tied
up to a female girl do you without a word
jim shake im sorry i acted mean just
now

  they shook hands

  all the same said dan you dont ex-
pect me to be terrible happy at the thought
of havin to leave yuh behind the next time
i go out into the desert jim

  jims expression became a shade less
cheery

  dan he said thats what i wanted to
tell you i cant quit prospectin-i wish
to god i could but i just cant dan i
didnt mean to tell lies but when i first
met the girl i got to talkin big-you know
what it is dont you dan and my
goodness dan how could i let folks id
met at a friends house think i was nothing
but a desert rat no dan it couldnt be
done i said i was interested in mines-
mines dan not just claims and then
dan-and it came about so quickly i cant
understand it now-then dan i found that
 couldnt live without her and something
told me that she couldnt live without me

by w to w nend
romance

and i asked her to marry me and dan-
jims voice rose despairingly- dan she
thinks that im worth about a million and
a half 

  dan tried to keep his face serious and
failed

  its all very well for you to laugh dan
summers said jim but see here son
its life or death to me what am i to do
i said i couldnt get married just yet id
some interests out on the desert i had to
clean up but id come back to los angeles
and marry her as soon as i could an
now dan ive got to get back on to that
dam desert again an find a claim that will
give me the money i want

  he looked at dan with an expression of
hopeless care and anxiety

  and dan stared back at him not know-
ing quite whether he was in earnest in
what lie said or not surely-surely even
old jim who was mad enough for most
things wasnt as mad as all this surely
he must realize how impossible it was he
couldnt do it go out on to the desert and
find a mine rich enough to get married
on what in thunder was he thinking of

  you poor old jim said dan and
he felt more sorry for jim than he had ever
felt for any one before the hopelessness
of what he had planned to do appalled him
an we been lookin for that bonanza now
-for how long jim how many years is
it since you an me been pardners jim
lad youve done it this time

  jim nodded in deep dejection

  you cant tell me anything i havent
told myself dan but theres gold to be
had out there dont we know it others
have made money damn il out of pros-
pects we opened up an didnt have capital
enough to develop dan ive got a hunch
that luck will turn ive found the right
girl-all i want is the money

  and dan seated on his bed in the little
room with the blue sky showing above the
roofs opposite and the breeze flapping the
curtains to and fro and the noise of drays
and trolley-cars coming up from the street
wondered how jim old jim should have
been so crazy

  wont the young lady find out he
said suddenly wont she get to askin
folks about your mine jim

  but jim had managed that too

  no he said i was careful dan i
made no mistake i dont own a big mine

or anything like that you see a mine here
and a mine there-minin stock an such-
like oh no danny you neednt worry
about that at all he waited a moment
and then continued and you will help
me dan wont you

  all right jim said dan and he tried
not unsuccessfully to put some enthusiasm
into his voice well try it an if its
possible to win out why jim i guess well
do it

  and then he began to wonder what the
girl looked like and he thought of elmer
and margie down at browning and some of
his gloom faded after all why shouldnt
jim get married he was old enough at
any rate why not and if he got a girl
who would be good to him who would
make him run steady why what was there
to growl at only no second-rater would
be good enough for old jim if she was as
good as margie why then jim would be
all right

  dan said jim i promised the girl
youd come out tonight and be introduced
dan groaned

  ill come jim uh course

   he felt it was the least he could do

as dan followed jims huge bulk up
the path that led to the front door a
sense of awe stole over him elmers home
which he had considered so grand was a
mere shack compared with this

  jim must have read his thoughts
some house danny he whispered
remember what i told you think of
the mines i own

  many times that evening was dan to be
amazed by his friend jim appeared in a
new light a man at home in society quite
at his ease in the gorgeously furnished
drawing-room in which they sat to look
at jim one might have thought that he had
lived in luxury all his life his manner was
perfection-yet in two days time old jim
would be loading burros and frying bacon
and rustling greasewood for a fire maybe
and being cursed perhaps for a good-for-
nothing old mossback for burning the bis-
cuits jim in an old khaki shirt and blue
overalls with the knees torn his face black
bending down puffing the flickering blaze
of a camp-fire

  and if dan was amazed by jim he was
still more amazed by jims choice of a
future wife he felt for some unknown

partners
reason uneasy it wouldnt do this was
not the sort of girl to make old jim happy
-even supposing that jim had money
she was handsome certainly and yet even
her looks counted against her her face
was too hard her smile seemed to dan
unreal her laughter forced and when he
looked into her eyes he saw something cold
and forbidding

  this prudence said jim waving his
hand in dans direction this is my old
friend mr summers dan this is miss
flood

  and dan after having shaken hands with
the girl who yas to marry jim seated him-
self on a chair and prayed that the provi-
dence that had guided him for so many
years through trials and troubles would
not desert him now

  they talked of the theater dancing
concerts religion-dan found that jim had
developed a brand-new god out of his inner
consciousness and was bewildered at this
fresh proof of his frier js diversity-
money the beaches californian wines
french wines the mountains the movies
paris frocks new york frocks london
frocks jewelry the cost of this and the
cost of that los angeles as compared with
san francisco and dan listened in amaze-
ment wondering how old jim with his
serious manner whose conversation with
him was of quartz and porphyry and schist
and granite veins and orts and outcrops
hoists and compressor and stamp mills
bacon and beer quarts of beer and whisky
gallons of whisky could hold his own in
such circles

  it took a mans breath away and al-
ways whatever the topic the talk veered
round sooner or later to money-money
was the axis on which miss floods world
turned and at intervals when he was least
expecting it dan would find miss flood
studying him carefully his features his
clothes his shoes his manner and his voice
as if pondering in her mind how jim with
his air of prosperty and culture could
have attached himseif to this

  and at last dan began to study miss
flood surreptitiously even as miss flood
studied him and he wondered if her ver-
dict of him was as unfavorable as his ver-
dict of her and jim went on talking as if
thoroughly enjoying the sound of his own
voice basking in his glory and the magni-
ficence of the girl he was to marry



  she was a good-looker all right dan
came to that conclusion unwillingly but
she wore clothes that had cost too much
money her jewelry was too extravagant
and he wondered if the tiny spot of color
in each cheek were real and decided not
and he thought of what old jim would
look like if jim had put dabs of pink on
his fat cheeksand he laughed at the pic-
ture and then looking at jim lolling
back in his chair talking-blast him-of
motor-cars and trips to paris dan knew
that there was in the matter of personal
adornment little to choose between them
jims face was smooth and pink and beau-
tifully shaven and powdered his hands
were manicured-the old stiff-he had
made the best of his looks so too had the
girl

  dan stifled a yawn what an evening
  miss flood spoke to him

  so youre taking jim on to the desert
again mr summers youll bring him
back soon wont you its his duty to
come back to me soon isnt it

  her voice was low and soothing and she
almost cooed at him

  yesm said dan

  jim has told me that you manage a
good deal of his business for him here
she leaned forward and her eyes such
cold blue eyes looked into his with an
expression that dan could afterward regard
as being firmness itself mr summers
jim is quite rich enough for me i dont
think he need worry about any more min-
ing properties do you he ought to put
some- of his money into industrials-or
securities that are a little more sound
dont you think so so please dont let
him get interested in any more mines
dan glanced at jim there was a look
of entreaty in jims face that begged him
to say nothing but what was in keeping
with what he had heard

  i give you my word said dan that
just as soon as jim has cleared up the deal
hes on now then back he comes to los
angeles an-i hope that youll both be
happy miss flood

  miss flood condescended to smile and
then as if her mind were at rest she
looked at the ring she wore dan looked
at the ring too-a gold band with a tiny
nugget set in turquoises it occurred to
him that he had somewhere or other seen a
ring that was exactly similar

by w townend
  the door opened and mrs flood entered
the big drawing-room-a stout old lady
with a stern nose and a double chin
dressed in black silk and with an air to
dans notion of being only a shade less
important in the scheme of things than the
creator thereof

  she was overjoyed to see jim and why
hadnt prudence told her also his friend
mr summers

  then mr flood arrived a rather meek
silent little man not fat like his wife but
rather lean-friendly undoubtedly and
anxious to show some kindness but seem-
ingly not knowing quite how

  the chatter of voices increased jim
talked volubly as much at home as one of
the family and prudence talked and mrs
flood talked mr flood sidled over to
dan

  are you going out on to the desert
again he asked

  dan came to himself

  yes he said

  mr flood sighed

  ah its quiet and peaceful out there
aint it not too many folks around

  why no said dan not too many

  ive been dragged to a concert tonight
said mr flood in a whisper singin an
music and me the only man in the place
almost say one of these days ill kick
you see if i dont are you glad to be
going back on to the desert

  am i said dan i sure am

  mr flood lowered his voice still further

  say mr summers you dont happen
to know if thered be any chance of-for
me to-

  henry said mrs flood what are
you whispering to mr summers for
bring him over here at once were going
to have some tea

when they reached the street and
were on their way back to the hotel
jim slid his arm through dans

  dan he said thank you for playing
up to me i had to tell her dan just to
explain that you were my-my business
manager you understand dan dont
you

  i understand said dan sure if
yuh hadnt said that shed have thought
that your friends was purty dam mean
hey not up to the standard they oughter

nce	

be but a business manager well he dont

count-

  but although jim said he was quite
wrong and protested vigorously dan knew
that he was right nor did he blame him
there was so much else to blame him for
one lie extra scarcely mattered

  shes fine aint she dan jim said
presently

  she is said dan

  and what else could he say who was
he to go criticizing his friends choice but
he knew that it was always the same men
were pals they had the same tastes in
everything until-until there came the day
when one fell in love and then--good-by to
everything he wondered if there had ever
yet been a man who admired the girl that
his friend had married and then with a
curious little pang he remembered elmer
and margie but they were different of
course he had known margie long before
elmer had

  jim said dan suddenly what was
that ring miss flood was wearin he
looked at jim and by the light of an arc
lamp saw his face take on an expression of
gloom aint that the one that belonged
to old pony martin who died out at
paradise crossin

  dan said jim i was going to ex-
plain that it sounds mean i know i
won that ring in a poker game a year ago
off pony i didnt want it but he made
me take it and when i got engaged i
had to have a ring so i thought of that
one and gave it to prudence the self-same
day

  pony told me a dance-hall girl in mo-
have give it him an she got it from-

  dan its the meanest thing i ever done
in my life and i said the nugget came
from one of my mines too but what else
could i do dan when i think how much
money ive spent in the past week i get
scared ive spent like a millionaire since
i last saw you

  jim said dan i done the same
i got seven hundred bucks taken offen me
this momin

  seven hundred not poker dan not
poker

  no jim charity or a hold-up mas-
queradin as such i aint sure which

it was a new jim who went wander-
ing off once more into the desert-
a jim who worked steadily who thought
of nothing but work and what work would
bring his optimism was amazing dan
wondered as he listened to him talking
of the future whether the lessons of the
past had taught him nothing he was
crazy of course

  he planned deliberately to find a mine
that would give him a fortune when he
had his fortune he would marry he spoke
too as if success must come within the
month had he no memory had he
forgotten the years of failure and dan
feeling that jim was doomed to disappoint-
ment liked him all the better for his
faith in his own destiny he deserved to
win if only for the very madness of his
scheme for who in his senses would have
tried what jim was trying

  they went out on to the desert north-
east from herkomer to a claim that they
had located the spring previous

  the stuffs there aint it said jim

  uh course its there said dan the
difficult part is gettin it

  he felt that it was his duty to keep
this difficulty before jims mind continu-
ally with the effect that after they had
been working for about a week jim got an-
gry-

  whats wrong with you dan the
ores there aint it why shouldnt we
get it sometime or other its got to be
found whats gold for if it isnt for that
an dan dont think that were out here
to fail why should i have met pru-
dence if it wasnt meant for me to get
married to her and how can i get mar-
ried unless j have money hey no dan
theres the gold here waiting for me

  nothing would convince him to the
contrary he had been guided by provi-
dence to prudence and the same power
would guide him to gold such arguments
were unanswerable and dan felt as he
worked all through a blazing-hot september
that there was something fine in jims
trust something that made him want to
do all he could to help him out his
heart warmed to him poor silly old jim
and it came to dan clearly that jim was
 better man in his old desert clothes
working from early morning until dark

unshaven and unwashed than when clean
and manicured and well-dressed he had sat
drinking tea and lying about his prospects
in the floods home in los angeles

  weeks wentby and gradually dan no-
ticed that jims spirits were sinking he
lost his happiness and became gloomy and
care-worn sometimes without a word he
would quit working and seat himself on a
pile of rock and almost as if his thoughts
were miles away examine piece after piece
of stone through his magnifying glass uutil
all at once he would spring to his feet
and growl at himself for wasting time

  and then dan realized that their claim-
the golden hope jim had christened it-
however good and it was good was not
going to make them rich quickly they
wanted money for development they
wanted to get some one with capital in-
terested and that seemed impossible
looking back on their months of work
sinking and timbering the shaft the fre-
quent assays the three shipments of ore in
side loads on the burros and a few miser-
able dollars in return it seemed incredible
that they could have kept up their hopes
for so long

  jim he said its no good

  i knew it dan i guessed so about
a week ago it aint what were lookin
for weve not got time enough nor
money enough to play about with it any
longer no we must get a move on some-
where else an where do you suggest that
we go danny north south east west-
where

  and this was another mystery to dan
more than ever now that jim was going
to be married did jim rely on his judg-
ment he could do nothing without con-
sulting him dan would pull him through
dan would lead him to a place where
there was gold and when dan asked him
what made him so sure he would smile
wisely and shake his head and have no
explanation even in writing letters to
prudence he would ask his advice and
prudences letters to him fetched from
herkomer seven miles away across the
desert he would read aloud and then wait
for him to make some comment on what
she said

  prudences letters wer never cheerful
why didnt jim come back to los an-
geles why didnt he hurry didnt he
ever intend to think of their marriage

b y w  i o w n e n d
romance

and after each of these letters jim would
fret and mope and worry and refuse to
eat

  and at last when they had been out on
the desert for six months dan felt that
they must take action if they wished to
dull prudences suspicions that all was
not right

  jim he said write an blame it on
to me i know she thinks im keepin
you here you say that i am whats
another lie more or less hey

  so a letter was written in which jim
said that the reason why he had not re-
turned to los angeles was that he had
been loo busy acting on dan summers
advice he had put money into what would
become one of the lmest mines in califor-
nia at present returns were not large
owing to the preliminary work the mine
however was rich in a short time he
would be getting heavy profits it would
not be fair to her for him to withdraw
his money and so jeopardize-good word
that said dan-jeopardize her future
prosperity for the sake of advancing their
marriage a month or so

  in reply a letter came from prudence
in which she said that she understood and
that if the mine were really good she was
quite content to wait but why she asked
had he put any of his money into any
more ventures after he had lelt los an-
geles why had he listened to that mr
summers had he not best take care
how he trusted his advice where had
he comc from was he reliable

  they were back in herkomer when jim
received this letter

  dan he said youve made it all
right so far as im concerned but that
little girl of mine has got it into her head
dan that youre up to no good my
god dan i dont know what i should
do if you and prudence were to fall out

  jim fell into a deep gloom that lasted
well on into the evening when he sat down
to a game of black-jack in the saloon

  for a while dan stood at the bar drink-
ing and talking then he went outside and
sat on the sidewalk and looked at the sun-
set and smoked innumerable cigarets and
waited for any train that might pass and
so prove that even herkojner was in touch
with the outer world and to dan it seemed
wonderful to know that the lines of steel
that stretched away east and west would

take him eventually to chicago or new
orleans or new york or to san francisco
or los angeles and yet here he was on
the desert short of cash with a crazy
partner looking for a fortune that might
not exist

  dan was not given to introspection but
he pondered then as to the attraction that
the desert life had had for him gold had
never seemed to him the one aim of exist-
ence as it did to some men he had never
valued money he spent easily without
regret he had never saved what reason
had he for saving when he had spent
everything that he had he would go back
into the desert and earn more and yet even
dan had his moments of doubt why should
he stay out in the desert at all he was
wasting the best years of his life and at
twenty-five his youth seemed to be re-
ceding gradually into the past what was
the spell that the desert had for him he
was puzzled by his own contradictions
was it the wish to possess a fortune so
that he might be able to live in a city for
the rest of his life or was it the mere
excitement of the search for gold the gam-
bling instinct that urged him on

  there arose sounds of scuffling from the
saloon and some one shouted-

  dan come along an take that darn
pardner uh yours home to bed

  dan strode into the little bar-room lit
by acetylene lamps where in the open
space between the bar and the pool table
jim was rolling over and over in company
with a man from randsburg hitting and
kicking and cursing and neither doing the
other the leat damage while the eight
or nine spectators herkomers bachelor
population for the time being stood around
and yelled encouragement

  whats wrong said dan whats
that old goat uh mine playin at

  glad carryin guns aint in fashion
said the saloonkeeper they was arguin
an then they sailed in

  it begun along uh garfield not havin
any money an borrowin fifty cents offen
jim to set into the game an now hes
won twenty-five dollars offen jim an he
ses he paid back the fifty cents jim ses
he aint

  this explanation given by an interested
spectator satisfied dan he stooped and
seizing jim by the collar dragged him oft
the man from randsburg rose to his feet

romance

and rushed at jim roaring in drunken rage

  dan slapped him on the face with the
flat of his hand he staggered and sat
down suddenly with his back to the bar

  lay down an keep quiet said dan
he marched jim toward the door an
you you big slob the best thing you can
do is to cut out the booze you aint fitten
to be left alone for ten minutes

  and then he led him off to the hotel
where they were staying and tumbled him
face downward on to his bed

  he was drunk of course the first
time in-dan thought-the first time for
over a year he needed watching old jim
did he was like a kid if things went
wrong he was sure to drink he couldnt
help it

  and the next morning when jim asked
if he had been in any scrap the night be-
fore as his head was like a buzz-saw dan
merely grunted at him

  youll get right outer here this mornin
jim youre a dam disgrace to a re-
spectable outfit quarrellin an fightin last
night like a drunken cowpuncher im
ashamed uh you i sure am i done tell
yuh moren a year ago jim that youd
have to cut out the drink ill have no
booze-fighter for a pardner

  sorry dan said jim and he looked
very penitent dont happen often sonny
an life aint such a hell of a joke at pres-
ent is it he yawned wearily wont
happen again dan

  lets go an see old pete harman
pete grinned as they entered the store
where one could buy anything that one
might need on the desert from beans and
bacon and canned goods to overalls leather
gloves picks and shovels and drills

  howdy boys heard yuh was in town
jim whats this they say about yuh beatin
up another gent because uh fifty cents in
my day no gentleman would have touched
another with his bare fists fists were good
enough for chinks an greasers they-used
guns in my day jim he shook his head
and winked solemnly an hows busi-
ness

we got money said dan a little but
i dunno pete how long it will last
whats the show to get a grubstake pete
pete plucked at his thin beard and
shoved his glasses on to his forehead

-well dan im good for a little any-
ways you done me a good turn over that

gold bug proposition we got a minin
man interested an i heard from old skip-
worth the los angeles hardware man last
night that he shouldnt wonder if that mine
aint goin to be a real big thing

  later when they reached the open once
more jim laughed

  it makes me want to sit down and cry
dan that damned old gold bug an we
sold it-for next to nothing

  aint no use kickin jim said dan
we hadnt money enough to develop it
an if we hadnt -sold youd never have
gone into los angeles an had a good time
an met miss flood an jim theres
as much gold in the desert as ever come out
of it so cheer up an lets see that smile
uh yours

  that night they camped in a little gully
in the side of the hills about eight or
nine miles from herkomer

  about two in the morning dan woke up
and saw that jim was missing feeling
uneasy he rolled out of his blankets and
left the tent a cold wind blew through
the sage-brush and cactus and the full
moon casting its silver light on the desert
made it as easy to see as in daytime

  jim was standing by himself on a bare
patch of ground gazing out across the grad-
ual descent of the desert to where miles
away some tiny specks of light marked the
progress of a train

  jim did not move as he drew near
  whats the matter jim

  dan i cant sleep it just come over
me sudden-all this he waved his hand
around in a circle this damned desert
an the hills an sky an moon an
no houses nor lamps nor policemen nor
streets-nothin but desert good god
dan dont you ever get like this dan
its breakin my heart im not as young
as i used to be dan im forty-one next
month useless an worn-out an tired an
here we are startin off on another trip
why was i mad dan couldnt i sec
the whole thing was hopeless and the
girls waitin an trustin-dan wheres
the end of it all

  now see here jim said dan grimly
you gotter stop this kind uh bunk dont
the girl love yuh dont she know that
youre doin your best all right then
shed wait till yuh was sixty if needs be
you go an turn in an be sensible

  all right dan said jim but then

by w townend
i	r o m ance l -

you dont know what bein in love is wait
till you cant marry the girl you want dan
an youll know what hell is

  for a long while dan lay awake and
thought he wondered if prudence would
wait was she that kind the kind that
would wait-year after year poor old
jim and then very sleepily dan thought
of jim rich and the girl he was going to
marry and mr flood and elmer who was
in that strange far-off way like jim and
margie who had married elmer-and then
he remembered what jim had said-wait
till he couldnt marry the girl he wanted
an hed know what hell was nobody
knew not even margie and then as he
dropped off to sleep he felt that life was
a very mixed-up kind of affair badly run
on the part of the higher authorities of
heaven

iv

in the months that followed jim
seemed to abandon all hope yet
when dan asked him if he would give up
the search he grew angry why should
dan think him a quitter

   he settled down to a state of perpetual
gloom he was no longer the old jim
light-hearted and cheerful and talkative
but silent and moody and likely to take
offense for no reason also and this was
to dan the final straw he began to drink
heavily even on the desert it was im-
possible to avoid the small towns that were
strung along the railroad there were sup-
plies to be purchased food and ammuni-
tion and from jims point of view most
important of all letters to be fetched let-
ters addressed to herkomer and forwarded
on to other small desert towns near which
they might chance to be

  and whenever they touched these out-
skirts of civilization jim would get drunk
he was not quarrelsome he was not amus-
ing he was merely stupid and even when
they once more went out into the desert
often a day or two late owing to his being
unable to move sooner he would insist
on having a supply of whisky with him

  argument was useless he would prom-
ise faithfully and then the next time he
found a letter from prudence waiting for
him he would slink off to the nearest saloon
and drink and drink until dan would
find him in a drunken slumber slouching

over a table or as often happened sprawl-
ing helplessly in the dust of the street un-
able to stand and yet in spite of his
drinking he kept talking of the need to
work they must make haste and find the
gold prudence was waiting and they had
been away from her quite long enough

  many times dan thought seriously of
leaving him he was hopeless worse than
any hobo

  they reached herkomer one evening in
november and as they sat at supper in the
little thirty-five cent chinese restaurant
dan spoke of the future

  im gettin tired uh yuh jim yardley
ive stood by you an you aint give me a
square deal ive been tryin to help you
all i can but yuh dont care-darn it
yuh dont give a cuss i dont count all
yuh care about is your belly- an booze i
tell yuh jim right now if yuh dont cut
it out i quit youre gettin soft an
flabby an mean youre ready to let me
work an you-you just drink an fret an
talk about why cant yuh get married an
what bad luck youre havin an then youre
so full uh your own troubles you just get

over there an look at your ugly face in
the glass you look like hell jim you

yuh this jim for your own good as much
as anything its got you an whats more

most fellers if i couldnt take a few
drinks without lettin the booze do to me
what it does to you id climb on the water-
wagon an stay there im warnin you
for the last time jim cut it out or you
get another pardner

  jim was very penitent

  im sorry dan dan i just dont
know how to explain-ive been mad i
guess its the worry an the fear that
we wont make good an the difficulty of
explainin to prudence thats made me like
this he stretched out his hand look
dan look at it shaking-im goin the
same way as i went before he looked at
dan quickly you dont remember that
of course dan that was before i came
out here dan im quitting right now

  that night he was drinking again dan
went over to him in the saloon

  you poor fool go your own way
then im through with yuh

  jim looked at him with glazed eyes

r o ma mce

  y-yesh dan-sher-nly-g-go myown
way-shure he frowned as if trying to
remember what came next a d-drink
dan-b-bfore y-you-go danny hey
about midnight dan was awakened by
heavy footsteps in the passage the door
of his room was opened

  you awake dan

  whos there he asked sitting up in
bed

  a man struck a match and lit the candle
weve got old jim outside dan shall
we bring him in he seems purty dam
bad joe an me found him in the street
they put him on the bed and he lay on
his back breathing heavily with no color
in his face and his eyes closed

  drink gets em like that dont it said
one of the men who was none too sober
himself do yuh remember old pony
martin bein just like this before he peg-
ged out

  you get to hell out of it said dan
furiously what the devil are yuh talkin
that ways for here one uh you go over
to the depot an get harry to send a mes-
sage through to barstow for a doctor old
jims bad i cant feel his heart hardlv
at all

  a week later jim was well enough to
be able to sit up and talk

  jim said dan- youre goin down
to the coast thats what youre goin
to do an dam sharp

  dan i cant im not goin to leave
you im so ashamed of myself an so
miserable dan i dont know how to begin
sayin what i feel youve shown me dan

what-

  cut it out ordered dan the doc-
tor man says you got to get away from the
desert for six months its the coast for
you old scout an no more booze other-
wise-

  does that mean los angeles said jim
with a faint hope showing in his expres-
sion

  no dan was firm you wont have
no rest an quiet there whats more yuh
aint got money enough you go down
south-san diego way find some little
ranch town near the ocean an stop over
till youre well

  wheres the money coming from dan

its going to cost something an-

  dont let that worry you jim ive
money left to start you off with an ill let

you have enough every week to live on
an if you go near los angeles i wont
have no more to do with yuh any letters

train-men to post em on from way up in
nevada we got to do something jim
or maybe the girls folks will begin fo
kick an weve been keepin her waitin
now jim about fifteen months aint it
we must keep on stallin thats all

  and that settled that jim wrote a week
later saying that he had kept his word
and had not stopped off at los angeles
he was staying at a little place called
nogal south of san diego near the bay
where there were lemon orchards and
palms and packing-houses

  for five weary months dan worked in
a mine in the hills earning as he put it
good money most of which he sent on to
jim and toward the end of april he
heard that jim was coming back to the
desert they arranged to meet at herko-
mer

  dan surveyed him critically when he
arrived he looked brown and well but
there were fresh lines in his face his eyes
had a hunted expression he seemed older
yet in spite of everything he was ready
and willing to continue his search for gold

  he had liked nogal but so he said he
wanted to get back to work

  i cant say that im glad to be out on
the desert again dan im not but weve
got to get hold of that mine dan how
much longer are we goin to be hey its
a year and eight months now dan since
we started in to look for that fortune of
mine is it any nearer sometimes i think
its hopeless to try any longer an then-
then i think of prudence an i know weve
just got to keep on an keep on but i
cant last out much longer dan

  got any money asked dan

  jim shook his head

  no dan i guess i spent all you sent
me an i didnt spend it on drink
either

  they went to see peter harman in his
store

  well jim how goes it better thats
fine dan youre lookin white thats from
workin underground hey wtiat are yuh
goin to do now

by w townend
  same old game peter out into the
desert again

  why didnt yuh come an ask me to
help yuh dan when jim got ill instead
uh dashin off that-a-ways

  dan smiled at the old man

  savin it up pete i knew when jim
come out wed be lookin about for a grub-
stake any hopes

 you boys always acted square by me
said pete an ill act square by you
i seen mr skipworth in los angeles two
weeks ago an he ses the old gold bug
is a-goin ahead to beat the band i got
hopes uh retiring purty soon dan an
buyin me an orchard

  not until they were once more trudging
across the desert a day later did jim men-
tion that he had seen prudence

  i just had to dan i stayed over in
lcs angeles after i left nogal youre
not mad with me are you dan

  dan glanced at him quickly

  i aint mad jim uh course not what
did yuh tell her

  i told more lies in those two days
dan said jim than i ever told in my
life before dan she thinks its you she
says i shouldnt have trusted you an
dan mrs flood says the same she told
me i ought to have put my money into
something safe the minute i got engaged
to her daughter i dunno dan but that
id lady didnt give me much peace she
said she thought you oughter be in the
pen an that i was crazy for not seein
through you

  an mr flood

  say dan im sorry for that little guy
said he wished he could come out on to
the desert and see you but his wife put
the kibosh on that pretty quick and
dan they dont believe i ever had any
money yet theyre not sure see mrs
flood said that her husband had been
makin inquiries an that no one had ever
heard of me an dan though i stuck to
that darned story of yours that my money
is tied up an i cant get it without losin
heavy the long an the short of it is ive
got to show em the goods

  dan grunted

  an miss flood

  jims gloom lightened and he became
almost animated and enthusiastic

  dan shes splendid dan i never knew
how splendid she was till i saw her again

you couldnt ask a girl like that to live
in a rooming-house an do her own cookin
shes been brought up to luxury i told
her that i wasnt goin to injure her pros-
pects by takin all my money out of where
it was just because her mother was tired
of waiting oh i was firm all right dan
i was firm as a rock but it was touch
an go they think im-well i dunno-
rich an eccentric i guess would about
explain their feelings he sighed drearily
poor little girl shes so tired of living
at home she ses she wants to be married
and have a home of her own an dan i
dunno but it never did seem so hopeless
an mad as it does this minute

  dan sympathized poor old jim mad
of course it was mad try as he might
dan could not foresee anything but fail-
ure more lies more stalling and some day
the inevitable exposure it was a miracle
that they had held on as long as they had

  for three months they prospected around
some hills where rumor had it there was
a mine that had been discovered and lost
in the far off s the rainbow some
of the assays were good but in no way
wonderful one claim that promised well
petered out but they ran a tunnel into
a hillside and managed to make a ship-
ment of ore by wagon before they knew
that once again they were disappointed

  its good said dan with machinery
and capital an a spur track across the
desert to the railroad it would pay for
workin but- he paused and thought
hard jim lad wed better try again

  jim sat at the mouth of the tunnel and
stared at the desert spread out before them

  theres a heap of land i can see from
here dan that weve not dug into yet
lets keep on a-goin he gave dan a
searching look dan youre not tired
are you

  im with you jim just as long as you
want me

  and dan felt strangely tender toward
his partner he was so big and helpless
so trusting and so confident they would
go on once more and in some other spot
they would search for the mine that was
waiting for them and supposing that the
years went by and they failed as others
had failed men who had gone out as full
of hope and dreams as old jim

  and then dan wondered what would hap-
pen if jim decided to give up what would

romance

he do dan broke off his musings and
looked across at jim still staring at the
desert as if brooding darkly on his fate
what would he do if he lost his partner
would he still keep on with his prospect-
ing what else could he do

  it was august again two years since
they had begun their search and the sun
scorched down on them with furnace heat

  dan wiped his forehead

  jim he said wake up old timer
wed better be packin out uh this lets
try somewheres further east

dan looked at the little particles of
gold that glittered in the bottom of
the pan for a time he dared not speak
was it possible that now-at last-they
had found what they were looking for it
was possible of course but not probable
other pannings had given him color but
never-never before had he got results
like this the rock was rich richer than
anything he had seen in all his long years
of the desert the little specks that caught
the sun were all the proof he needed

  he stared at the great masses of red
porphyry rising from where he stood toward
the crest of the hill barren and forbidding
in the glare of the sun then he turned
and let his gaze wander over the gray mo-
notony of the desert undulating covered
with huge rocks and boulders with here
and there patches of greasewood and squaw-
berry a sea frozen into immobility stretch-
ing away as far as he could see to the dis-
tant hills range upon range to where far
off and faint against the blue sky incredi-
bly clear in that calm atmosphere was a
tiny spur which he knew was signal peak
near death valley

  and was this the place where they were
to find their fortune

  jim came slouching wearily toward him

  he roused himself

  jim he called here

  well said jim

  what do yuh know about this hey

  on othereoccasions during the past two
years jim had burst into yells of delight
had danced and song and thrown his hat
into the air he had shown his delight in
wild transports he had chanted extrava-
gant praises but now-now when he saw
before him evidences of gold in greater

quantity than he had seen before now he
merely nodded his head and said under his
breath my god and is this it he
seemed like a man so utterly tired that
nothing would rouse him yet dan knew
that jims feelings were too great for mere
outwarjl display his luck had turned
its come at last dan said jim

  its come at last said dan

  dan said jim well call it the pru-
dence shall we

  sure thing said dan call it the
prudence jim if yuh want to it dont
look no diffrent from any other place we
tried in the last two years does it an
yet-jim if i aint deluded myself-this
is the richest thing the deserts seen since
the nevada booms

  my god said jim if it only was
if it only was

  dan roused himself

  lets get busy jim we got to stake
out them boundaries before anything else

a month later dan felt that his ex-
expectations were to be fulfilled
when he had entered the saloon at herko-
mer on his way to file his location claim he
had been asked how things were going

  anything in view dan another bo-
nanza

  every one laughed dans bonanzas
were notorious dan laughed himself

  another bonanza he said solemnly
and he went out chuckling

  no one believed him of course but
they little knew

  the assayers reports ran into figures
that made him open his eyes very wide in-
deed and shout uproariously at jim but
jim merely shook his head

  why dont you show some enthusiasm
said dan sourly you old cripple why
dont yuh shout dont yuh know that
this little old prudence mine uh yours is
the biggest thing in the way uh high-grade
ore south uh tonopah  

  i dare say dan-i hope so anyway
but somehow dan i aint got a shout
or a laugh left in me we cant be sure
can we dan even now that something
aint going wrong

  what more do yuh want youve got
a mine there jim that ull make a mil-
lionaire uh you i wonder what the selby
smelter ud show-hey jim before an-
other years out lad youll be drivin

romance 

around in your own auto an askin your-
self if yuh ever was on the desert or if
you dreamed it

  thats just it said jim i dont see
how its goin to be done in less than a
year theres a lot uh things i never

thought of dan when we started-

  shucks youll have enough to get
married on in less time than all that said
dan dont yuh get to worryin jim
weve got what we been aimin at at last
an now lets get on with that shaft of
ours

  that evening dan looked up from the
calculations that he had been making 
the back of an envelope

  jim he said lookee here some-
bodys got to take three uh the burros an
trot down to herkomer tomorrer would
you like the trip

  i dont mind if i do dan im ex-
pectin a letter from prudence an i might
as well fetch it an what else dan i
guess were short of a lot of things hey
jim yuh gotter go to old man har-
man an ask will he fix us up with some
grub an ammunition were short im
not denyin it tell peter in confidence
kind uh that we got a crackerjack proposi-
tion out here dont lay it on too thick

you see what yuh can do with old peter
about gettin some timber sent out just
whisper in his ear that you an me aint
gettin nothin outer the old gold bug mine
that we sold-an hell come through with
the goods without worryin

  early the next morning jim departed
with three burros for herkomer twelve
miles away northwest of where the pru-
dence mine was located

  dan watched him go striding across the
bare desert after his burros swinging along
as if he had thrown aside a weight that
had bowed him down he was happy dan
knew happy and yet scarcely able to real-
ize that happiness was within his reach
after two years the gamble was justified
and what a gamble the odds against
   dan flipped a piece of shale at a
bull snake

  a thousand million to one old worm
aint it

  and the future   he wondered

  from where he sat he could see in his
mind mine buildings the dump the ore
bins the dump cars the chute the bunk-
houses assay  office blacksmiths the
cook-house the railroad track winding
across the desert following the trail that
jim had taken on his way to herkomer
and there would be work and prosperity
and the papers would be full of quota-
tions of the prudence stock and he and
jim would be rich and jim would be mar-
ried    and this brought dan up with a
jerk old jim married to prudence and
settling down to a life in a city with all
the comforts that wealth could buy and
a wife who would spend his money   
and maybe neglect him and let him drift

  and then dan not quite so cheerful as
before strolled off up the slope to the
hole in the ground which would soon very
soon now become a mine

two evenings later jim returned when
he was yet afar off dan saw him ap-
proaching walking behind the three burros
in a cloud of dust dan whistling to him-
self put the coffee-pot on to the fire and
began to prepare supper

  he waved his hat and gave a yell of
welcome as jim came toward him over the
last hundred yards and then he stopped
startled there was no response from jim
he tramped forward steadily his head
downcast his shoulders bowed-his whole
appearance betokening gloom also and
this was to dan something that was beyond
all explanation the burros were not loaded

  when he was quite close to the tent 
and the fire in its little niche between
the rocks dan spoke to him

  whats wrong with yuh jim

  jims looks frightened him his face
was gray and ghostlike under its mask of
dust his eyes were bloodshot his lips were
swollen and drawn back from his teeth he
breathed with an effort also he had been
drinking and drinking since he had left
herkomer

  jim said dan slowly whats the mat-
ter with yuh

  nothing much dan ill ffcll you pres-
ently ive got to see after them burros
burros nothin ill see after them
youre all in set down an rest

  jim dropped on to a boulder and sat
with his head in his hands without moving
the picture of hopeless despair dan was

partners
romance

worried but he said nothing in good time
when he felt better jim would tell him
what had happened but in the meantime
why was it that he had come in from her-
komer without stores did he expect them
to manage without grub or ammunition

  jims hand strayed to his hip-pocket
dan jumped to his feel and strode toward
him

  none uh that he said pass over
that damn bottle

   their eyes fought

  come on said dan do as i say
understand

   jim muttered something under his breath
and then after a few seconds indecision
passed him over a flat bottle

  dan for gods sake dan dont throw
it away keep it dan an maybe ill

need it im sick dan-

  youll be a dam sight sicker before
ive finished said dan he threw the
bottle against a stone and watched the
liquor soak into the sand now then
what the hell do yuh mean by cornin back
the way yuh are i warned yuh before-
an you know what the doctor said jim
are yuh plum crazy

  dan said jim suddenly and he
seemed too broken to show any resentment
dan its all up everything we cant
make it he drew a letter from the breast-
pocket of his shirt read this its from
prudence

  there was in his face an expression of
dumb helpless suffering that dan did not
like

   the letter began

dear jim

   father says i must write to you and tell you
that our engagement has lasted long enough i
have waited now for two years and you have
kept giving me excuses as to why our marriage
should be postponed have you been telling me
things that arc not true a friend of fathers
a mr skipworth told us that you have been
prospecting on the desert for years without suc-
cess you did have a claim he says which you
sold to him and some friends to develop mr
skipworth sold some stock in this mine the
gold bug to father he says that you are not
rich at all is this true are you or are you
not rich i must know this at once i feel
that you have ncglccted me and been most un-
fair it is not that i care for money myself
but i think that the time has come for plain
speaking father tells me to tell you that if
you can not within the next two months prove
to us that you have an income on which to sup-
port a wife in comfort then i must do as they

have urged me to do for some years and marry
some one else and although my heart is break-
ing at the prospect i feel that i must obey

ever yours with all love

prudence

  p s-mr skipworth says that you never
did own a big mine in your life he knows the
desert well and he says that he would have heard
about the mine if it had existed-i mean that
mine in which that mr summers told you to
put so much money but then he says also
that it might possibly be something that had
been kept a secret from every one and he says
also that he may be mistaken about you being
poor what am i to think

  dan whistled softly he glanced at-jim
seated in the same attitude of despair
had he guessed did he nol realize the
truth prudence was tired-and he was
not surprized after all old jim had kept
her waiting for two years but what were
two years if a girl loved a man she didnt
that was plain she would give him up
poor old jim unless he proved that he had
the money and a durned good job too
a girl who could write a letter like that
wasnt a fit wife for a man as good as old
jim and then dan remembered the pru-
dence mine and its possibilities its cer-
tainty of success and he knew that jim
had the money at last and he felt depressed
and sad and uneasy jim turned and
looked at him

  well dan he said youve read
it havent you she told me that she her-
self didnt care whether we had money or
not but its her people they made her
write and theyll make her marry some
other feller dan you know yourself i
couldnt drag that poor girl out here
were up against it dan unable to do a
thing

  whats the matter with the prudence
mine weve t two months aint we
jim on the letters own showin

  jim rose to his feet with a groan

  damn it whats two months to us
weve no ammunition no grub no timber
nothin were broke busted why dan
we cant even go ahead with that shaft
timber dont grow on the mohave does it
we couldnt make any shipments of ore
we cant even eat let alone develop dan
we havent got money enough to keep us
out here another week an you know it

  but said dan feebly what about old
pete

  jim burst into a hoarse cackle of laugh-
ter

by w townend


 romance t

  oh my god dan didnt i tell you
old man pete wouldnt give me a can of
tomatoes even only a few beans an cof-
fee didnt you see those burros without
a load pete ses he aint a charitable in-
stitution for keepin you an me out here
in comfort well get no grubstake from
him dan an thats a fact

  dan stared at his partner in dumb sur-
prize

  aint he got the gold bug him an
his partners an we aint got nothin
the gold bug said jim is flat-as
flat as my old face i couldnt get to
understand rightly what had happened
dan but it looked mighty queer to me
some of the bunch got out without losing
but peter got stung and hes like a bear
with a sore head he says if he meets that
skipworth person therell be something do-
ing

  oh said dan so thats it is it
fte laughed dryly old pete hey theres
the prudence just as good as ever it was
old pete or no old pete dont forget that
jim

  whats the use said jim in a tired
tone dan the games up dan you
know as well as i do better that we cant
go ahead an develop an -get capital in-
terested without money ourselves i know
its good amazing good an that makes
things worse dan you knew i was crazy
two years ago thinking i was going to pick
up a fortune all in a minute didnt you
maybe i did said dan but jim
others made fortunes why not us an

anyways-

  he broke off and began to think money
he must have if he were to be able to help
old jim and where was money to be
found was there any one in the whole
world who would advance him what they
needed and then there flashed into his
mind suddenly a ray of hope elmer-
elmer prescott with all his prosperity his
land and houses and orchards and stores
he had helped elmer elmer would
help him he gave a laugh things were
working out

  jim he said if in two months from
now you could go  miss flood and mrs
flood an show them your assays an the
reports from the smelter an the minin
engineers report an the names uh the
bunch youd interested in the mine
wouldnt they give yuh more than the two

months money talks jim wouldnt they
listen seems to me jim that well
pull it off even now

   we cant live on nothin dan wheres
the money coming from an we dont
want to sell the old mine same as we
sold the gold bug to some piker wholl
give us enough to buy hash with an in-
side a year be hirin a suite at the fair-
mont for his wife an kids no danny
i dont see anything but you an me pullin
out an gettin a job somewhere in a mine
oh lord dan it ull just about kill me
an then-even then dan it ull be too
late if prudence dont marry me dan if
she marries some one else then the darn
mine may go to jericho an stay there-
im through

  jim said dan do yuh remember
that time i went to browning two years
ago an give away seven hundred bucks
well the feller that got the seven hun-
dred offen me ull see us through hell
stake us to what we want

   dan said jim brokenly dan youre
just a wonder i dunno why i ever
doubted you

   ill go to browning an see him said
dan an ill come back with the money
just as quick as ever i can get here an
what about you jim if yuh go into her-
komer can i trust yuh or are yuh goin
to get on the razzle again

  jim reddened under the grime and
sweat

   for gods sake pan give me a chance
wasnt that letter enough to make a man
drink i wont touch a drop dan till you
come back an thats the truth

  what in the world will yuh do when
yuh get all that money jim an dont have
to work

   its only the dam desert that makes
me drink dan once i gel away from here
-lord almighty he breathed deeply
what will i want to drink for hey 
only go on the jag when im worried an
things go wrong-why therell be pru-
dence dan too would a man go on the
booze with a wife like prudence an a
good home

   not unless hes about eight diffrent
kinds of a dam fool he wouldnt said
dan

   for some minutes jim seemed to be lost
in thought then he stood up and looked
down at dan

p a r i n e r s
  danny when im married i want you
to promise youll come an live with us
ive been thinking dan that life ud be
pretty dam miserable unless i knew you
were handy prudence may be a bit pre-
judiced dan for the time bein but shell
get to like you dan as sure as you
live

  dan laughed and said nothing but he
wondered uneasily what jims married life
would be to jim prudence was the fin-
est and best woman that ever lived and yet
   there was that letter she wanted his
money nothing else if jim were poor she
would turn him down flat and jim was
aching with love for her    poor silly
weak-minded old jim the best old moss-
back that ever hiked across the desert after
a burro    and a girl like that waiting
to grab him and worry him and drive him
to drinking   -

when dan reached browning he
found that the browning of two
years ago had vanished brownings busi-
ness section had when he last stood in
the main street no more than six or seven
buildings now both sides of the street
were lined with stores-some cement some
wood one with a brick front the street
was no longer dusty and uneven and ill-
kept but of smooth asphalt the open
spaces where he remembered having seen
the vacant lots with the notice boards were
all built on there was a new church
houses had sprung up on every side in the
midst of gardens and lawns and on the
brown and parched foothills beyond the
green orchards were huge oil derricks

   dan halted on a street corner and gazed
about him the bank was now a square
substantial building of cement opposite
was old newsoms office unchanged save
perhaps for a new coat of paint and some
specimens of browning grown fruit lemons
and oranges and apricots and peaches in
the window from where he stood dan
could see a butchers a bakery a paint
store a restaurant two new grocery stores
a harness makers a picture theater no
less than one two three real-estate offices

   a wagon drawn by two mules pulled up
by the curb the driver a stout bearded
man whom he did not know gave the reins
to a lad who sat by his side



   take these an drive to the packin-
 house then he climbed down from the
 seat aint you dan summers i
 thought so my names harvey i bought
 the old gregson place mr summers i
 want to know if youll give me the first
 refusal for them lots of yours i guess
 thats what you came in for hey

   dan stared at him without making any
 reply his lots it wac only with difficulty
 that he recollected that he had any lots

   come on mr summers ill give you
 a thousand for the three five hundred
 down rest payable by instalments at the
 usual interest

   why said dan why i hadnt exactly

 considered- 

   a thousand he felt as if he stood on
 air a thousand dollars for three miser-
 able lots that had been forced on him
 against his will was the man crazy

   dan summers he turned as some
 one shouted from the other side of the
 street old newson bareheaded was run-
 ning toward him dan dont you do
 nothin rash you wait for me dan

   he reached him puffing and blowing
 come on mr summers said the
 rancher once more dont mind him
 what about my offer take it

   what offer said mr newsom shrilly
 whats he offerin you dan come on
 acrost the street to my office an talk it
 over

   a thousand for the three lots thats
 the offer said dan

   dan said mr newsom theres five
 hundred dollars for each lot waitin for
 you the minute you step into my office
 spot cash an you wont get a better offer
 than that

   dont you believe it said another
 voice if you will shout all over the
 street what your business is dont blame
 folks for hearin mr summers my name
 is millington i represent the browning
 realty company an ive been tryin to
 find you for the past eighteen months

   mr newsom took dans arm

   come on over to the office

   mr millington a pale-faced young man
 with glasses gently put his hand on dans
 shoulder

   mr summers he said two thous-
and dollars for your three lots there -
close with that deal an the moneys yours
 within twenty-four hours

  two other men one lean the other fat
also strangers to dan came running up

  is that mr summers are you willing
to sell your lots mr summers

  aw get to heck outer it roared mr
newsom why dont you get outer bed in
the momin

  you aint sold yet have you said the
lean stranger

  twenty-five hundred mr summers for
the three said the fat stranger

  a small barefooted boy ran shrieking
down the street

  popper dan summers has come back
dan summers what owns the lots has come
home

  his voice died away in the distance like
the whistle of a locomotive entering a tun-
nel

  doors opened and people came into the
street

  dan broke loose from mr newsom and
faced the little group of men

  i dunno as i want to sell after all
you fight it out among you gentlemen
ill see yuh later

  he crossed the street and entered the
bank

  syd turner threw up his arms and
shouted

  dan summers by all thats holy dan
i thought you were dead where in
thunder have you been

  whats it all mean syd i dont
understand

  dont understand well take a look
out of that window dan syd pointed
to the oil derricks on the foothills see
them dan oil brownings on the map
at last booming

  oh said dan an that explains it
an what about them lots uh mine syd
i paid the taxes for the past two years
dan of course but if you mean to sell
i want to buy em dan well-id like to
but  aint got money enough he dis-
appeared into the huge safe and came out
again with a bundle of papers here
are your deeds and titles dan

  dan mused

  see here svd im new to this game
it aint like minin what are those old
lots uh mine worth

the cashier leaned over the counter
dan he said it aint nothin to do
with me im neutral but as a friend ill
give you a word of advice dont yoir



take a cent less than two thousand dollars
for em

  for the three

  three nothin for each of em six
thousand the three

  dan stared at him with a feeling of
bewilderment and awe six thousand
why he was rich and old jim would be
able to go ahead-nothing could stop him

  here he said its enough to make a
feller feel faint lemme get out into the
fresh air again an have a talk with that
bunch thats been trvin to give me money
whats makin every -one so dam crazy
to get em syd

  well danny that lot of yours down
the street used to be off out of sight
now the business section extends way the
other side of it your lot lays between
the palmer grocery store an the brown-
ing realty company both want it see
and those other two lots down  third
were part of a subdivision of ten acres
old man newsom got hold of the subdi-
vision piece by piece all but your two
lots an he owns the ten acres west of it
as well he plans to put up a home some
day an thats why he wants your two lots
he wants em bad an every one knows it
if you sell the three lots together dan i
guess youll get the best price

  dan nodded and went out into the
street

  old man newsom - advanced grinning
fiercely behind were millington the
bearded rancher and the two men who
had come up later and a dozen others
gesticulating shouting arguing all ap-
parently hating each other and all united
in an intense and overwhelming hatred for
old newsom

  now said dan whats the best of-
fer im in a hurry and to save time ill
tell yuh right now i wont take a cent
under six thousand dollars for the three
lots

  somewhat to his amazement no one
seemed surprized

  and after this all dan had to do was
to lean against the wall of the bank and
listen and marvel and wonder at the luck
that had been his in having the lots to sell

  a quafter of an hour later having sold
his lots for ten thousand dollars cash to
old newsom he sat with him in his office
and watched the deeds being typed out by
a tow-headed girl who ever and anon gazed

partners
           romance

at him with wondering eyes as at one whose
existence had long been a myth in the cir-
cles in which she moved

  they walked across to the bank and
dan still in a kind of waking dream
stowed the ten thousand dollars away in
his note-book and not even in desert
mining-camps in boom times when money
had been plentiful had he handled so much
currency at one and the same time and
all his own no one elses but his own
he could scarcely believe it

  well he said on the desert gentle-
men after a deal of ths kind its the cus-
tom to liquor up is there such a-

  syd turner shook his head

  you cant get a drink in browning
not unless you go an get bit by old dad
stringers pet snake an enlightened opin-
ion thesi days dan is against whisky
bein good for snake-bite so there you are
were dry an its just as well for you
dan that we are you want to go an
sleep it off thats what you want

  satisfied said old man newsom dryly
  you betcher life said dan

  an youll know where to come if you
want to buy a home hey

  i wont forget said dan

  they shook hands and old man newsom
went back to his office

  dan turned to syd

  an now i s go an see elmer pres-
cott thats why i came here in the first
place

  guess you wont dan said syd
  why not said dim

  he aint here hes in los angeles
gee-whiz dont that beat anythin
i guess hes gone to live on one uh them
boulevards with millionaires on each side
uh him i always thought old elmer would
make his pile quick

  it aint quite like that dan tell you
the truth elmers been kind of sick an he
left browning in the spring an aint been
near us since

  dan was puzzled there was a curious
reserve about syd that was difficult to un-
derstand it was almost as if he had de-
cided not to talk about elmer at all

  ill give you his address dan if you
want to see him said syd but you
wont find him quite as he used to be i
guess that illness of his upset him con-
siderable he scribbled an address on a
slip of paper an now dan you come

 up to the house an eat dinner with us i
 want you to taste my wifes cooking be-
 fore you go out into that old desert again

 dan was still in a dazed state of mmd
 when he reached los angeles he had
 gone to browning in search of money
 scarcely daring to formulate a figure even
 to himself lest he be disappointed and he
 came away with thousands

   their troubles were at an end they
 could develop the mine with ten thou-
 sand dollars what couldnt they do and
 jim-poor old jim would be able to marry
 irudence

    and at the thought of jim merried dan
 grew serious would prudence make jim
 a good wife of course not there was
 the letter to prove it yet if jim thought
 that prudence was everything in the world
 to him then there was nothing for it but
 to let him marry and be miserable for the
 rest of his life

   but before going on to herkomer and
 proving to jim that the age of miracles was
 not past dan determined to call in at
 elmers new home and ask how he was
 and to tell him of his good fortune and
 thank him for having insisted on his tak-
 ing the lots

    he asked a policeman if he knew where-
 abouts the street was situated-

	the policeman glanced at the slip of
 paper

    other side of the southern pacific he
 said and then gave more explicit direc-
 tions

   dan rather startled thanked him at
 first he thought that there must be some
 mistake

    and when he reached the street a mean
 little street in which children shrieked at
 their play and stood in front of the house
 with the number that corresponded with
 the number on the slip of paper dan was
 still more troubled and perplexed and he
 hesitated quite a long time before he ven-
 tured to tap at the door for the street
 was squalid and dusty and dark from the
 pall of smoke from the railroad yards and
 the house was small and badly in need of
 paint there was a window broken and a
 huge hole in the lower half of the screen
 door yet the place was neat and over
 the tiny porch there grew a bougainvillea
 with purple blossoms just like the bougain-
 villea that had grown on the veranda of

by w townend	
r o m j

the white house at browning two years lie-
fore

  dan knocked twice and then he heard
footsteps and the door was opened and
through the rusty wire mesh of the screen
he saw margie

  you she said in a low voice

  dan stared at her without speaking and
she opened the screen door

  dan entered and found himself in a
small parlor low and dark and incredibly
hot furnished plainly and poorly

  he looked at margie and a lump rose to
his throat and he felt that he had done
wrong in coming she was gazing out of
the window into the street with its crowd
of children playing and men in their shirt
sleeves sitting cn their front porches read-
ing and smoking just as he dan summers
might have sat in front of the saloon at
herkomer

  he did not speak he could not he
knew now that elmer had failed and that
this wife of his who was to have had
everything that any man could give a wife
who should have been clad in silks and
satins or whatever it was that rich mens
wives did wear who should have had peo-
ple to wait on her was living in a tiny
frame house in a back street dressed in
an old plain skirt and waist with a big
apron cooking and working and scrubbing
   and yet looking the same margie
that he remembered years before she had
met elmer and when he himself had had
hopes   

  and at last she turned and looked at him

  well dan she said

  she was paler he decided but then not
even at browning had she had much color
her brown eyes met his steadily trustfully
her lips were set in a wistful little smile
but she gave no sign to show what her
feelings must be

  i went down to browning said dan
finally an they gave me elmers ad-
dress-

  she smiled sadly

  its not quite the same as browning
dan is it elmers been ill a long time
but hes getting better fast she hesi-
tated as if not knowing quite how to say
what she had in mind dan you mustnt
be surprized at the change in him hes
different from what he was dan

  then she opened the door leading to
another room

i n c e

   elmer she said heres a friend come
to see you

  and dan entered a small bedroom where
on a low bed facing the window lay el-
mer worn and wasted and pale and so un-
like his former stout and happy self that
dan was horrified

   elmer he said

  elmer gazed at him with a look of utter
weariness in his eyes

   dan he said

  then he coughed and tried to raise him-
self on his elbow but his wife stopped him

  lie down elmer she said she
pushed a chair toward dan take a seat
dan an talk

  elmer said dan im awful sorry
to find you bad this way why i was
lookin to see yuh hustlin round los
angeles buyin an sellin same as you did
at browning

   i suppose youve been there hey said
elmer an they told you all kind of
stories about me of course

not a word elmer not a word syd
turner give me your address an said
youd been ill an thats all i done hear
elmer gave a feeble imitation of his old
laugh

  why dan didnt they tell you i went
broke lost everything and that poor
little wife of mine- dan saw in his ex-
pression as he gazed up at his wife pride
and affection and so it seemed shame
dan you dont know what shes done for
me

  now elmer said the girl gently
dont please

  i will marge i want dan to know
what kind of a wife i got when things
went wrong dan she turned to and
worked she never let me lose hope she
put up with my sulks she thought out
plans she-why dan i just cant tell you
what that little margie means to me
dan listened with a feeling of the most
intense sadness he had not yet recovered
from the shock of finding margie whose
future was to have been so brilliant
margie who was to have had fine clothes
and jewels and motor-cars and happiness
living in this small shack in poverty
how did it happen he asked
nothing went right said the girl
and elmer got sick and couldnt look
after his business that was the begin-
ning

partners
roma nc e

  i couldnt pay off ray mortgages said
elmer that old rat newsom foreclosed
cm me an then there was some land of
mine i thought maybe had oil in it-any-
way one thing after another went wrong
an there wasnt one of them that would
lift a hand to help me no dan not
one

  it came over dan with fresh amaze-
ment that he had gone down to browning
to ask elmer for money and here was el-
mer wilhout a cent-and ill into the bar-
gain poor old elmer and the lots that
elmer had once owned had sold that very
day for ten thousand dollars

  the sick man was talking in a querulous
voice

  if id had money id have pulled thines
off it was that what knocked me dan
just that an how have you done dan
made that pile yet

  no said dan but weve got a mine
now thats goin to be the biggest thing
that california ever seen

  they all say that said elmer  every
one of them he frowned if i could
get some money even now dan id make
good i would so ive had hard luck the
worst kind of luck aint i aint that so
margie

   nothing else said the girl with a little
-igh that and you being ill but were
going to begin again elmer an things
will never be like they were before will
they

  all at once the sick man turned his face
to the wall and began to sob

  oh my cod he said my god
margie speak the truth margie tell dan
what i was tell him what i am-that
im no good that i never have been-an
never will be-

  dan stood up and looked helplessly at
margie

  its nothing she said he gets like
that at times dan hes not very strong
yet thats why

  she knelt by the bed and tried to com-
fort him

  dan waited he wished he could slip
quietly away but dared not move and
then elmer spoke to him again

  dan he said ive been tellin lies
it was my fault everything poker an
whisky nothin but that night after
night id land home drunk mornings
id be too drunk to set up i was never

sober dan thats the whole story an
that little wife of mine never let on to
folks what she was sufferin but just did
what she could do to make me run straight
dan you dont know what margie went
through in them days she stood by me-
she never blamed me never said a hard
word i knew i was killin her but i kept

on the same old way an the-

  hush said the girl dan dont you
believe it

  and dan thought of the days when jim
had gone wrong and he wondered what
would have happened supposing that jim
had been married would jims wife have
been ls true to him as margie had been
to elmer

  an then dan we came to los angel s
margie got a job as a stenographer an i
just kept on with the drink why didnt
she leave me god only knows dan an
when at last i seen what i was an quit i
got ill an shes been nursin me ever
since-workin herself to death for the sake

of a useless miserable-

  the girl leaned forward and put her
hand over his mouth

  you mustnt elmer now you must
stop youre making things out to be
worse than they are

  her cheeks were flushed and there were
tears in her eyes

  ive learnt margie said the sick man
ive learnt my lesson at last

  dan walked over to the window and
stared into the dusk poor little margie
a drunkards wife he knew now what
she had been through he could remem-
ber on the desert the wife of an assayer
who drank    and the life she led
   the neglect and the cruelty and
the blows    what people had
thought and said    and how sh
had lied and denied that her husband had
raised a hand against her   sup-
posing old jim went the same way as el-
mer after he married jim had said that
it wouldnt be possible not with prudence
for a wife it had been possible for el-
mer and he had had margie there would
be no one like margie to help jim

  and dan knew that if he could make
margie happy if he could lift the cloud
from her face and bring back the joy and
laughter and happiness that he remem-
bered he would have done something to
be proud of and if ever a girl deserved

 y w  towne nd
romance

happiness it was margie jim of course-
jim must be a happy too and jim
would be happy there was the ten thou-
sand dollars and    but would jims
wife do what margie had done and
dam it would jim be happy

  he turned and looked at margie seated
by the side of her husband stroking his
wasted hand

   elmer she was saying theres no
reason to say its too late i guess we can
fight it out you an me she glanced at
dan hes all i have dan so maybe i
get a bit anxious about him

   the germ of a great idea was growing in
dans mind he had jims happiness at
heart but if he could make margie
happy also so much the better

  are yuh gettin enough to eat an
drink elmer he asked yuh need
feedin up an margie speak the truth
what have you had to eat today

   oh im all right she said im go-
ing back to work tomorrow too dan
im leavin you for the time bein
said dan ill be back maybe in an hour
or two i want to get you some things
you need feedin up elmer i wish to
heaven yuh could get outer the city into
the country

   he felt that he must discover cost what
it might whether prudence was worthy
far too long he had been content to be a
spectator the time for action had come
he had watched events mold the lives of
his friends for good or ill now he himself
would shape their future  it was
within his power

vii

dan rang the bell of the front door of
the big house where two years before
he and jim had visited prudence

  the door was opened by a maid in black
with a white apron and a tiny cap

  good evnin said dan genially
folks in

  the girl eyed him suspiciously from
head to foot		

  i guess youve made a mistake

  dan conscious of an old khaki jacket
and trousers and a sombrero with a droop-
ing brim grinned

  i guess i aint he said tell miss
flood an old friend from the desert has
come to see her

  the girl showed him into the drawing-
room and he waited surveying the knick-
knacks and pictures and furniture with ap-
preciation old man flood might be a
weak-kneed little runt but he sure had the
goods when it came to setting up house

  the door opened and prudence came in
when she saw dan the expectation faded
from her face and she looked annoved

   you she said

  was this the wife for jim this
dressed up doll would she understand
and make allowances would she help
him when he was down and out would
she keep him from drinking or even try
to he hated to think of what might
happen

  howdy miss flood said dan

  is there anything i can do for you
she asked i was expecting a message
from mr yardley

  jim dont know im here said dan

  but wont you sit down do

  miss floods manner became ever more
cold and distant as he drew up a chair
and seated himself opposite

  miss flood he said i want to see
jim happy

  and he found time to wonder which of
the many possible meanings she had pul
on his remark

   miss flood jim aint worth a million
an he never has been when he told you
he was rich two years ago he knew he would
be before long but things didnt pan out
as we meant em an hes been worryin
himself purty near crazy just because uh
keepin you waitin now im tellin yuh
the truth miss flood jims goin to be
rich hes got a mine at last that will
bring him in all he could wish for but its
goin to take time to open up an thats
why i come here to have a talk with you

  the girls eyes seemed to be looking
right through him dan felt that she re-
garded him as something beneath con-
tempt he continued amiably smiling at
her as if at one of his dearest and most
trusted friends

   a girl what loves a feller aint goin to
let nothin like money stand in the way uh
their gettin married an thats where
jims been mistaken all this time aint it
miss flood what im cornin to is this
then supposin jim dont get that mine
uh his developed quite as quick as he j
oughter can i tell him hes not to hang

partners
usages

r o mance

 back any more outer a sense uh pride but
 that hes to come in right away to los
 angeles an you an him get married

   miss flood rose to her feet dan rose
 likewise smiling as if the interview was
 proceeding with the utmost harmony and
 good taste on either side

   tts better to be livin on beans an
 coffee in an old shack on the desert an be
 in love he said than to live in a palace
 an quarrel over the champagne an
 oysters

   no one he felt could have put things
 more plainly yet more pleasantly

    miss flood spoke at last

   i think that mr yardley has behaved
 as no gentleman ought to behave hes

 told me deliberate lies-

   which thought dan was just what the
 old idiot had done

  but he loves you he said thats
 the main thing miss flood

    miss floods eyes blazed

   dont you understand she said that
 ive been kept waiting for two whole years
 and now you come and tell me that he
 never had any money and never will have
 oh he will have said dan he
 will have

   she sure was angry too what chance
 would old jim have in a scrap with her
 the old mossback would take the count in
 the first minute

   the door opened and mrs flood en-
 tered

   mother said her daughter its just
 as we thought its all lies from beginning
 to end-jim-mr yardley never had any
 money at all she waved a hand tragi-
 cally at dan who hung his head and looked
 penitent and had as much as he could do
 to keep from shouting this man has
 told me everything

   oh said mrs flood then i was
 right

   and he comes here said miss flood
 suggesting that i should marry jim and
 go and live on the desert

   jims got a mine maam said dan
 that will run him into millions

    the stout lady silenced him

   ive heard that before she turned
 to her daughter any thought of mar-
 riage between you and mr yardley is out
 of the question prudence

   dan fumbled with the brim of his hat
   then i guess ill go back to old jim

 an say that miss flood refuses to carry

 out her share uh the contrack-

 he felt that he did not like these people
 at all

 you may say exactly what you like
 said mrs flood it was only through a
 mistaken sense of honor that my daughter
 did not break off the engagement months
 ago

 but now i know said miss flood i
 will write to mr yardley and ill say
 exactly what i think of him

 i guess ill be goin said dan

 the door opened once more

 mr skipworth said the maid

 dan stepped to one side as a stout little
 man in a brown suit with glasses and a
 bald head entered

 dan saw him advance holding out both
 hands

 my dearest prudence i only heard you
 were in town this afternoon i simply flew

round-

 why horace i never-

 dan saw a signal of distress pass be-
 tween mother and daughter it was awk-
 ward for them of course

 good evnin mrs flood good
 evnin miss flood mr skipworth i
 guess wegot a mine now that ull make
 the old gold bug look like thirty cents
 good evnin

 and he made his escape

 in the hall he met mr flood

 why if it aint jims partner dan
 summers 

 hows things said daij

 mr flood winked then he opened the
 front door and let dan out on to the
 veranda

 say there aint much peace these days
 in this house im just about tired of it
 this time last year we were all on theoso-
 phy now were spiritualists say it gives
 me a headache hows jim

 shoulder

his name an i guess dan i guess one of
these days seein that jims dropped out
or so the wife tells me horace will come
amblin forward to ask if he may call me
popper an when that day comes-
again mr flood glanced over his shoulder
-dan you dont think theres any place
out on the desert where a feller could rest
awhile-no lea parties no religions no
afternoon recitations-nothin but men an
the open air and a chance to be peaceable
for thats what im aimin at

  they shook hands solemnly and dan
departed

it was dark by the time that dan once
more entered the little parlor of el-
mers house

  margie he said i want to see you
an elmer again its important

  the girl looked at him queerly and led
him into the bedroom

  elmer said dan ive been doin a
heap uh thinkin since i come into los
angeles an im goin to help you an
margie i couldnt do it before as i
wasnt sure if things was what i thought
they was now i know he paused and
looked at margie and then backagain at
her husband do you remember those
three lots yuh sold me two years ago
elmer

  the sick man looked uncomfortable

  they were worth nothing dan and i
made you take em

  i only took em as there werent no way
uh refusin em without hurlin your feel-
ins i made up my mind that id hold
em on trust an that one day id give em
back an im doin it now margie
you collar hold uh them he placed the
bundle of bills in her hands thats
what i sold em for this morning its
yours every cent

  the electric light shining on the girl
made her face look strangely white and
worn

  how much is it she asked in a low
voice

  ten thousand dollars he said

  the girl gave a hard laugh

  take them back dan she said we
cant keep them were not beggars
dan

   listen margie are yuh goin to throw
away the chance uh gettin elmer out uh

this into the country an startin fresh
the moneys yours i never thought uh
the lots as mine at all if you dont take
the money margie ill set a match to
every last one uh them bills i mean it
the girl looked at her husband and her
husband looked at dan with a hopeless
kind of expression as if he wished to speak
but had neither the courage nor the
strength and outside in the street the
children laughed and shouted and some
one was playing la paloma on a guitar
and dan thought of the night when two
years ago his heart had been breaking
and he had listened to margie singing that
same old tune and then from the railroad
there came the shriek of an engine whistle
and the clanging of a bell-and the spell
was broken

  dan said the girl what makes you
do it why should you come here and
give us this money why dan

  it was very hot and close in the little
room dan felt as if he could scarcely
breathe

  aint elmer my friend wouldnt he
have done the same for me

  elmer turned his eyes away from him
and stared at the ceiling

  dan he said you call me a friend
but i dunno dan i dunno that ive ever
been much of a friend id have written
to you about those lots months ago but i
didnt know where to find you ive acted

mean all through i thought when-

  and because margie was listening and
it is not right for a mans wife to hear him
belittling himself dan stopped him

  now margie he said you put that
money into the bank first thing tomorrer
and then he told them that he would
have to leave them he had a train to
catch-he was going out into the desert
again that night

  margie saw him to the porch and in the
misty blue darkness she thanked him once
more

  i know that thanks dont mean much
as a rule she said but i dont think any
one in the world would have done what
youve done for us dan think of all
that money dan surely you must need
some of it dan youre not rich i know
its yours said dan cheerfully
every cent

  i cant understand said the girl
youve saved us of course i guess el-

partners
j - i romance

mer would have gotten worse if wed had
to have lived on here-and now-now
dan-

  she stopped

  well said dan i guess ill be sayin
good-by

 good-by said the girl good-by
dan well write when were settled you
must give me your address dan before
you go an dan youll come an see us
again wont you

  me said dan thoughtfully i
dunno if ill be cornin off the desert again
margie not for a long time he took
her small hot hand in his good-
by old marge yuh gotter get elmer well
again thats your job get him well old
girl an be happy

  and then to his horror margie leaned
her head against the screen door and put
her hands to her face and began to weep
quietly

  dan turned and made off at the cor-
ner he remembered that he had not given
her the address that she had asked for
he hesitated a moment and looked back at
the little house by the light of a lamp he
could see that she had not moved she
still leaned against the screen door with
her hands to her face

  dan turned once more away from the
house and walked quickly toward the
station whistling

jim was still asleep when dan reached
the loft over pete harmans barn
dan watched him lying on his side his
hand under his cheek his face peaceful and
sad and worn and he noticed the gray in
his hair and the lines in his forehead and
the kindliness and weakness in his mouth
poor silly old jim and when he woke
up he was to have the bitterest blow that
he had ever had and yet the best news that
he would ever hear

  jim opened his eyes and saw him

  dan he said why dan

  he sat up in bed

  dan shook his head

  jim im sorry

  jim stared at him with an expression of
despair

  couldnt- he moistened his lips
couldnt he let us have anything he
asked

  not a cent he said not a doggon
cent

  you did your best dan said jim
you did your best im sorry for poor
prudence though two years shes waited
an now- he sat with bis hands clasped
about his knees i guess ill get up
dan

  for a time neither spoke

  jim said dan i seen miss flood in
los angeles last night shes engaged to
marry a man called horace-horace skip-
worth

  jim dropped his shoe on to the floor

  whats that he said hoarsely pru-
dence goin to marry-

  i went and called at the house jim
an i told her how youd worked all them
years for her sake an that youd be rich
soon would she wait a while longer till
youd a chance of opening up that mine
of ourn she wouldnt hear of it jim an
thats the truth shes through with yuh
im sorry jim i sure am

  there was a very long silence indeed

  they made her said jim finally it
was her mother the best an truest girl
a man ever had an ive lost her an my
own fault-my own dam fault for lyin
dan i dont blame you at all i dunno
what else you could have done no i
dont blame you at all

  dan felt no remorse the morality of
his action worried him not in the least
jim might think what he liked he did
not care prudence was not going to marry
him and what else mattered

  there was a letter for jim that same
day and a small parcel

  from prudence said jim with a sigh

  she musthave written directly  left
said dan

  jim studied the letter without making
any remark then he handed it over to dan

  read it he said its all up dan

  he opened the package slowly inside
the paper was a small white box in which
was the ring

  dan read the letter

  you have behaved abominably i never wish
to see you again father says that if he meets
either you or your partner he will take steps to
show you what he thinks of your conduct i
think it right to tell you that  am going to be
married to an old and very dear friend early
next month he has been waiting for years i
have felt lately that my affection for you had
never been all that i once imagined it i would
never have given you up however had it not
been for the lies that you told my suspicions
have proved to be correct the ring i am retum-

b y w townend
romance

ing in conclusion i would like to say that the
discovery of your deceit has meant a joyful de-
liverance from what would have been an unhappy
marriage

  huh grunted dan purtv straight
well-

  jim was staring at the ring which lay in
the palm of his hand

  a small girl the daughter of the station
agent came running past inthe direction
of pete harmans store

  bessie said jim heres a present for
you show it to mother an tell her its
yours say i gave it you

  he yawned

  dan he said that mine of ours-
ive been thinkin-that prospect of ours
it cant fail dan whatever happens an
it ud be just as good a prospect whatever
we called it dan lets change its name

prudence dont sound right lets call it
tl joyful deliverance

  meanin said dan

  meanin that prudence has hit the nail
on the head i guess dan ive been a
fool were goin to take a job in a mine
so that we can save up money enough to gy
ahead developin the claim its the only
way to make good dan an i dont give
a darn im free anyhow

  an vou feel theres some hope for yuh
jim

  jim turned and looked at him and a
slow rin spread over his round sunburnt
face

  i feel dan that thered have been
mighty little hope if youd laid hands on
that money it was luck that that pal of
yours couldnt let you have what you went
after wasnt it

  just luck jim iust luck said dan

the meeting-place

we are now well into the story of
captain lingard and his rescue of
the english yacht with all its peril to
his own ambitions here is joseph con-
rad as he is pictured by that vivid amer-
ican critic james huneker

 i-ie is not so tall as he seems he is very
restless he paces an imaginary quarterdeck
and occasionally peers through the little windows
of his quaint house as if searching the weather
a caged lion i thought his shrug and play of
hands arc gallic or polish as you please and
his eyes shining or clouded are not of our race
they are slavic even the slightly muffled voice
is slavic one of the most beautiful languages
is the polish-the french of the slav tongues as
it has been called when mr conrad speaks
english which he does with rapidity and clear-
ness of enunciation you can hear rather over-
hear the foreign cadence the soft slurring ot
sibilants so characteristic of polish speech in a
word he is more foreign-looking than i had ex-
pected he speaks french with fluency and pur-
ity and he often lapsed into it during our con-
versation like many another big man he asked
more questions than he answered mine i under-
went the same experience with walt whitman at
camden who was an adept at the gentle art of
pumping visitors in the case of joseph conrad
his curiosity is prompted by his boundless sym-
pathy for all things human he is as you may
have surmised from his writings the most hu-
man and lovable of men he takes an interest
in everything except bad art which moves him
to a vibrating indignation and he is extremely
sympathetic when speaking of the work of his
contemporaries what a lesson for the critic
with the barbed-wire method would be the re-
marks of conrad upon art and artists naturally
he has his gods his half-gods and his major
detestations the bible and flaubert were his
companions throughout the many years he voy-
aged in strange southern seas from the bible
lie absorbed his racy idiomatic and diapasonic
english from the supple shining prose of the
great french writer he learned the art of writ-
ing sentences their comely shape and vigorous

rhythmic gait their color perfume the passion-
ate music of words and their hateful power he
also studied other masters he is an admirer of
poe hawthorne walt whitman and henry
james among american writers

conrad has never yet written a ro-
mance more interesting than his own
life the name he was born with which
he bore for almost forty years was teodor
josef konrad korzeniowski his father
was the son of a polish squire in ukraine
where teodor josef was born in  in
the early sixties cames the last polish re-
bellion an event in which my paternal
grandfathers two sons and his only daugh-
ter were deeply involved and one which af-
fected the future of all my generation and
coloured my earliest impressions he says
his fathers activities in this uprising led
to his banishment by the russian govern-
ment early in this exile conrads mother
died and conrad was sent back to the uk-
raine to live with his uncle his father
too ill to be dangerous any longer was
permitted to join him in  the broken
revolutionist took his son to cracow the
old polish capital and died there the next
year

  there the boy went to school and there
-still a boy-he formed the resolution
that determined all his after life in a land
entirely cut off from the sea and withno
more knowledge of the english than he had
got from translations from english books
he made up his mind that he would be a
seaman and an english seaman of the
merchant service the objections of his
relatives could not change him and in
 he left home to begin a totally new
life


roma nce

  marseilles-the scene of the arrow of
gold-was what he calls his jumping-off
ground his first days there were spent
among the provencal sailors on shore and
in pilot ships his first contact with an
english vessel came one night when he
pulled bow in the dinghy that put on board
the pilot of the james west oil conrad
tells about it himself

 a few strokes brought us alongside and it
 was then that for the first time in my life
i heard myself addressed in english-the speech
of my secret choice of my future of long friend-
ships of the deepest affections of hours of toil
and hours of ease and of solitary hours too of
books read of thoughts pursued of remembered
emotions-of my very dreams and if after be-
ing thus fashioned by it in that part of me which
cannot decay i dare not claim it aloud as
my own at any rate the speech of my children
thus small events grow memorable by the pas-
sage of time as to the quality of the address
itself i cannot say it was very striking too
short for eloquence and devoid of all charm of
tone it consisted precisely of the three words
look out there growled out huskily above my
head

it was three years later than he first set
foot in england in  he landed in
lowestoft after what he calls his wild oats
sowing period-adventuring in the med-
iterranean and voyaging twice to the west
indies for five months he was a collier
on a lowestoft coaster learning english
from sailors and from the newspapers
then he joined the duke of sutherland as
an ordinary seaman

  from then until  he followed the
sea the polish boy became a master mar-
iner in the english merchant service-he
was both naturalized and made master in
 and by  when he left the sea
the master mariner had become a novelist

alfred a knopf the publisher
tells of the steps by which conrad
found himself a novelist in the late eigh-
ties conrad took a holiday on land and
was bored by it some years before he
had become pretty well acquainted with a
man in borneo who stuck fast in his mem-
ory and his interest to pass a tedious hol-
iday he began writing this mans story-
the story of almayers folly when the
holiday was finished he carried the manu-
script about with him to add to as time and
inclination made possible two years
later he was in the tropical forest of the

belgian congo and when he came out he
brought with him very little but the mak-
ings of a severe fever and the first seven
chapters of his novel he had his bout
with the fever and went to geneva to con-
valesce and there he wrote chapter vhi
in the course of a trip to poland and then
back to england he wrote chapter ix
then for three years the manuscript went
to sea with him in all the writing of the
story covered over five years and while
he was writing it conrad had only a hazy
idea of ever finishing it-none at all of
publishing it

  but in  feeling rather wretched
from the effects of that congo fever he
began to think of settling down on land
he did not decide definitely but by way of
an experiment he sent almayers folly
to a publisher he says that if it had been
rejected he would never have written
another book it was accepted and pub-
lished in the year following he married
and published an outcast of the island
which definitely fixed him in his new career
and his life ashore since then he has lived
mostly in kent where he has raised his
family and written his books

it is a full life he has lived some ad-
mirer of his has taken a map of the
world and marked on it the places conrad
has used as settings for his stories it would
be hard to find a writer who without ever
moving from his own study has covered
so much of the earths surface even in his
imagination conrad has been to these
places himself for twenty years he went
up and down the world how keenly he
saw what came beneath his eyes and how
deeply he understood what he saw you
can find in his work he is the only living
english writer who has been seriously com-
pared with the greatest novelists that have
lived-balzac flaubert meredith and
henry james and the great victorians
tolstoy turgenev and the big russians
hut he is different from them all time
will have to fix just where he belongs in
the line but there is no one of them who
so combines romantic setting and incident
with the utmost realism in digging for the
truth of character and human experience

   what he writes is the result of labor of
the hardest kind here is a picture of the
workman side of him from robert lynd
the british critic

the meeting-placl
romance

mr conrad has never been in a hurry
even in telling a story he has waited on
fate rather than run to meet it i was never he
declares one of those wonderful fellows that
would go afloat in a washtub for the sake of the
fun on the other hand he seems always to have
followed in his own determined fashion sudden in-
tuitions much as great generals and saints do
alexander or napoleon could not have seized the
future with a more splendid defiance of reason
than did mr conrad when though he did not
yet know six words of english he came to the
resolve if a seaman then an english seaman

  he has always been obedient to a star he
likes to picture himself as a lazy creature but
he is really one of the most dogged day laborers
who have ever served literature in typhoon
and youth he has written of the triumph of
the spirit of man over tempest and fire we
may see in these stories not only the record of
mr conrads twenty years toil as a seaman but
the image of his desperate doggedness as an
author line by line he writes rather than
page by  page was the growth of almayers
folly he has earned his fame by the sweat
of his brow he speaks of the terrible bodily
fatigue that is the lot of the imaginative writer
even more than of the manual laborer i have
he adds carried bags of wheat on my back bent
almost double under a ships deck-beams from
 in the morning till  in the evening with an
hour and a half off for meals so i ought to
know 

  conrad himself tells this about the writ-
ing of his longest book nostromo

truth to say i had not known for weeks
whether the sun shone upon the earth and
whether the stars still moved on their appointed
courses i was just then giving up some of my
allotted span to the last chapters of the novel
nostromo a tale of an imaginary but true
seaboard which is still mentioned now and again
and indeed kindly sometimes in connection with
the word failure and sometimes in conjunction
with the word astonishing i have no opinion on
this discrepancy its the sort of difference that
can never be settled all i know is that for
twenty months neglecting the common joys of
life that fall to the lot of the humblest on this
earth i had like the prophet of old wrestled
with the lord for my creation for the head-
lands of the coast for the darkness of the placid
gulf the light on the snows the clouds on the
sky and for the breath of life that had to be
blown into the shapes of men and women of
latin and saxon of jew and gentile these arc
perhaps strong words but it is difficult to char-
acterize otherwise the intimacy and the strain
of a creative effort in which mind and will and
conscience are engaged to the full hour after
hour day after day away from the world and
to the exclusion of all that makes life really
lovable and gentle-something for which a mate-
rial parallel can only be found in the everlasting
sombre stress of the westward winter passage
round cape horn

  if conrad is new to you you will want

to read after the rescue his first two
books-the second one first an outcast
of the island shows captain lingard in
mid-career when as rajah laut he was
the benevolent despot of the malaysian
islands in almayers folly he is an old
man lord jim and victory are stor-
ies of the east too in nostromo con-
rad goes to south america-it is in this
novel that he created a whole country for
his setting the secret agent is a tale
of londons underworld of spies and anar-
chists under western eyes of a sus-
pected revolutionist in russia and geneva
heart of darkness of the mysterious for-
ests of the congo the arrow of gold
of france and spain in the time of the
last pretender and beside these there
are all his stories of the sea-the most
famous of them are youth the nigger
of the narcissus and typhoon

there hasnt been long enough be-
tween the time the first number of
romance came out and the time when this
number has to go to the printer to hear
much from readers but writers started
months ago when it first began to be
rumored that romance was to be asking
just what do you mean by romance
now and then some one both asks and
answers the question

  here is w townend speaking from
newick sussex in the november issue
mr townend had a story called miss-
ing in this issue is another-partners

am very glad to hear that romance has
started on its voyage may it be long and
prosperous i do not think you could have
chosen a better name than romance it has
always seemed to me that the ideal life consists
of a blend of romance and adventure and even
when we are apt to consider our daily round
dull and monotonous in the extreme there are
if we will only use our eyes and ears adventure
and romance waiting for us

  i remember when i was still in khaki an
animated discussion taking place on the real
meaning of the word adventure every man
present had been in battle not one had any de-
lusions left regarding war and the glory of kill-
ing-war represented much weariness and dis-
comfort and hunger and cold and misery and
horror unspeakable-yet i suppose in each
mans mind there was a lurking sympathy with
the soldiers life the comradeship at least any-
how-and excuse my wanderings-it struck me
as curious that everyone agreed that you could
not have real adventure unless the risk of death

the meeting-place

iq
romance

was present whether this is a definition that
would meet with general approval is doubtful
but there it is then the talk drifted to the
other extreme-romance and a man said well
ii there can be no adventure without the risk
of being killed you certainly cant have romance
without the risk of being married and that
was that

  but i dont think he was far wrong

however you can get romance without that
risk entering in i remember for instance au
old woman in albert during the battle of the
somme in  who lived in her shattered little
old house in spile of all attempts to persuade her
to leave she used to sell coffee to the troops and at
limes would talk to us in a mixture of french and
very broken english her story was that every-
one she loved was dead through the war her
husband had been killed when working behind
ihe line her two sons had been killed at verdun
her daughters husband had been brought home
a cripple and had lived in the back room be-
hind the kitchen where we had our coffee and
then the daughter and her baby had been killed
by a shell one day in front of the house she
 howed us where they had been standing when
the shell landed and so she was left alone
with her crippled son-in-law and then he went
also died in bed and the old woman was sell-
ing coffee lo british soldiers and was waiting for
her turn to come she knew she would be killed
sooner or later she was as much a fatalist as
ny of tllfc natives of india or as any soldier
i always felt i should like to know wliat hap-
pened to her

  when we left to go up to the lines she was
still in her old house i never heard whether
she was still alive in march  when the
germans expiring effort brought them surging
into the town once more if she were alive
i wonder whether she remained in albert or
consented to leave i ought to be able to
finish the story but i cannot

  i take it though that this would come under
the heading of romance

but romance is everywhere in the factory
and workshop and tenement and ranch and
store romance is that which to many a man
and woman makes life possible you cant get
away from it and the rum part of it is that
half of humanity doesnt realise it they go to
the pictures-movies isnt it-or the theatre
or they read fiction and they think how lovely
it would be if only the romance they see depicted
before them could enter into their lives while
all the time they arc surrounded by romance
chunks of it

  its a queer world anyhow one mans meat
is another mans poison what is romance to
one may be every day monotony to another i
remember hearing a little man who worked in an
office in the city of london talking to the second
engineer of a tramp steamer who had just landed
after- a western ocean voyage in mid-winter
when food had given out and the boats and
rails had all been carried away by the sea and
the engineers and firemen had been knee deep
most of the time in water and the biice pumps

 i qo

had got choked and the average rate of speed
had worked out at something round about a
knot and a half an hour for days and days and a
deck hand had been drowned and the sccond
mate had broken his leg

  the engineer had talked in a matter-of-fact
kind of way of the voyage he was glad to
be alive and on shore nothing much else
was in his mind but that and the little
clerk who had been listening to him sighed
deeply ah it was terrible no doubt but
how romantic  the engineer put down his
drink and looked at him romantic  he said
in a puzzled way you heard what i said mis-
ter didnt you esj said the little man
beaming through his glasses i did and
you call it romantic well i tell you mister
if youd been there same as i was in that ruddy
engine room with the crank pits full of water
and no lights working youd have called it same
as i did    bloody hell i which may or
may not be polite but it was certainly true

  and yet that sccond engineer though he didnt
realise it couldnt have lived the life of the little
clerk the office work would have killed him
and the little clerk pined for the change of
scene and the comings and goings of the life of a
tramp steamer engineer though he wasnt capable
of doing the work or wouldnt have been prob-
ably even had he had the training

change of sccne travel meeting fresh faces
  its all romance nothing but romance
though as the engineer would have said plainly
and truthfully if coarsely had he been asked
a helluva lot of change of scene i get on my
watch below with about a hundred and ninety-
nine things to do in the four hours an travel
one port is like another so far as im concerned
wherever you are new york or san francisco
or bombay or capetown theres always the old
blinkin engines that need tinkerin

  however it is the man who has travelled who
has seen other countries and other people that is
the most interesting man to meet almost im-
perceptibly his opinions broaden and he has a
keener insight into what really counts in this
little world of ours if it were made a law that
all men should live for a whole year in a coun-
try other than their own what a difference it
would make in the way the nations of the world
regard each other

  at present one is inclined to be despondent
reading the papers now studying the jeal-
ousies and suspicions that are rampant
everywhere one almost wonders whether all
virtue went out of mankind at  a m on
november th  when the killing ceased
human nature is pretty much the same every-
where i loud yells of protest i but its true
but the weird part of it is that men and women
are in the bulk infinitely better than the poli-
ticians who govern them without politicians
or politics or votes or parties wouldnt th-r
world be a much more friendly and sociablc pla 
than it is at present

  nothing is sacred to a politician not even the
truth anything that may be used to bring in
votes must be used  hence international jeal-
ousies

the meetinc-place
           j romance

 but all this is drifting away from what i had
 in mind when i began this letter and talk-
 ing of romance where else can you get the spirit
 of romance better expressed than in kiplings
 lines

 see the shaking funnels roar with the peter at
   the fore

 and the fenders grind and heave

 and the derricks clack and grate as the tackle
   hooks the crate

 and the fall-rope whines through the sheave
        its gang-plank up and in dear lass
        its hawsers warp her through

         and its all clear aft on the old trail our
           own trail the out trail

       were backing down on the long trail-
         the trail that is always new

   you know it dont you great stuff some-
 day i suppose i shall find myself on a steamer
 pushing out of southampton water in the fog
 with the whistles screaming and the tug boats
 panting up and down and the isle of wight
 very green and hilly ahead    and then
 cherbourg maybe    queenstown harbour
    if the liners still call    and old
 jspike with its barracks and search lights and
 f   the open sea    and then later on
 the ambrose channel light    and if one
 morning when you arc seated in your office up
 to your eyebrows in work with a string of call-
 ers-authors artists adventurers of every de-
 scription-waiting to see you if just when you
 are at your busiest you hear sounds of riot-
 ing outside and the door is flung open and a dis
 reputable looking old guy in shabby clothes and
 a battered hat bursts into the room yelling
 dont be surprised i for the disreputable looking
 old guy will be-rather ungrammatically-me i

 a good deal of the authors own
 experience must have crept into the
 miniature some pages back sandy
 and the dream girl was in our last issue

 i came to america from australia fourteen
 years ago after spending eight years before
 the mast in the ships of all nations my native
 country is denmark i was born in a little fish-
 ing village on i he north coast of zealand i
 have been a sailor miner pearl-fisher gum-
 digger life-insurance salesman window-cleaner
 lumber-jack structural iron-worker copra-trader
 and-oh yes opera-singer

   i failed in none of these occupations that
 was my misfortune had i made one signal fail-
 ure i should have started to write five years
 earlier at it was i plugged alone every one of
 these vocations and made a fair living

   five years ago i took up writing for two
 years t starved artistically and with abandon
 the third year i began to learn-and sell today
 i am doing what i like to do and getting paid
 generously into the bartrain i sometimes have
 to pinch myself to see if im not dreaming

   i work six hours a day-from nine to three-

sunday included why should i exclude sunday
when im getting enjoyment out of it some-
times i loaf for a couple of days getting ideas
but even that is part of the routine

  my favorite recreation is deep-sea fishing and
i hereby challenge all comers with a four-ounce
sinker and three bass hooks

  as to the genesis of sandy and the dream
girl i ran away from an english ship the
adderley in eureka northern california in
 with my blankets on my back i tramped
inland during the night in this new strange
country of yours-and now mine i could speak
just a few words of english i had not one penny
in my pockets but when dawn came i was in
a valley so beautiful that i forgot all about
being hungry and broke

  the girl of course is pure imagination but in
every such valley i wonder is there not a girl
like her

you remember sanctuary in the no-
vember issue the author of it
norval richardson writes from the ameri-
can embassy in rome mr richardson is
a mississippian who follows the double ca-
reer of diplomacy and authorship he
neglects to say anything about the fact
that he has written several novels-one of
them the world shut out only just
published

there is very little for me to say about my
story sanctuary except that it is one of the
results of my life away from america-a matter
now of ten years the field for fiction in euro-
pean or in foreign life is unlimited today and
particularly so when one treats it in relation with
americans living out of their own country i
find it almost impossible to treat this subject
convincingly unless i use at least one american
character in the foreign setting i have tried
writing entirely of foreign people but have in-
variably found it a failure as the connecting
link-or the point of view of foreign life char-
acters-must always be seen through the eyes
of an american to make it seem real it is my
intention to continue using foreign settings and
foreign types as particularly now americas in-
terest and relations are so much nearer foreign
lands than ever before

harles beadle who wrote the
inner hero for our november is-
sue also writes this greeting from paris

allah yahdik o romance as the arabs
would say however thats another side of
my life than the milieu of the inner hero
personally i have a theory that a writer should
only use material which he has more or less
actually lived anyway i work on that prin-
ciple i was born at sea somewhere in mid-
atlantic and my people have been seafaring on
both sides for some generations back two grand-
fathers were north sea whalers-which doesnt

 in the least prove that i know anything about
 it you will probably say well the tang of the
 sea seems good to me and i will defy any storm
 on any ship on any sea to make me seasick the
 most exhilarating spectacle in the universe to me
 is a storm at sea-preferably in mid-atlantic-
 my native heath naturally i met with sailor
 and firemen of all sorts in my kidhood but the
 principal material lor this story was gained dur-
 ing an abortive attempt to become a marine engi-
 neer about twelve months in the  shops which
 persuaded me incorrectly enough that there was
 no romance in greasy pistons valves and what not
 and set me wandering in africa for a decade im
 afraid that this confession wont convince anyone
 that i really lived that life that i have done
 more than walk through a portion of it as it
 were but then the whole point depends on
 what on can see in that walk the po-jesion of
 the seeing eye as conrad has it after all
 baldly speaking that is all writing is to me
 a mania to tell other folk what i see in my walks
 abroad as arnold bennett t think pointed out
 once the primitive novelist is the man who in-
 sists upon telling all his pals often to boredom
 about the astonishing doe fight he has seen in
 the street

 atur-yl history is never an ob-
 stacle to the true romancer-here
 tie testimony of one of- them

 riger lure was written through a mis-
 apprehension i found a rumor in vene-
 zuela that the jungles held a kind of puma that
 ran together in flocks like wolves called the
 hunting leopards

   that grabbed my fancy right on the christ-
 mas tree and everywhere i went i had a pack
 of from twenty to fifty leopards right behind me
 they were particularly numerous and glowing
 when i sat down at a typewriter

   during a newspaper career i had learned the
 -ymptoms  celebrities who want to be inter
  iewed it became quite clear to me that these
 hunting leopards wanted to be written up so
 i began to pull some character together to feed
 to these notoriety seekers unfortunately i had
 to investigate the character of the hunting
 leopards themselves through a number of
 natural histories and encyclopedias fancy my
 astonishment and indignation when i discovered
 there were no such animals but the fool leop-
 ards didnt know they were not they kept right
 on hanging around me and my typewriter seek-
 ing publicity in movie star fashion so i
 changed em all into jaguars conjured up a
 scheme to draw a lot of jaguars together and let
 em dq their worst

   the worst was tiger lure

 first as last we may as well face the
 very real magazine problem arising
 from the fact that truth is stranger than
 fiction so well do it now while were get-
 ting acquainted with jack hines

often after an editor has asked uct
on my marrow-bones and swear ilc
of the episodes contained in the storiesj
of the alaska malamutcs arc true i nj
to pity to think that they have never
hand had the opportunity to know thcl
beasts of the far north

  the reader must appreciate that dogs
companions that beguile the solitude o
minable winters in that faraway land 
spent eight years without leaving its ci

the log men breed from wild wolves freq
and that occult something that all thing
possess is gradially developed and finall
comes merged in the affiliation between 
and dog  have no words to picture foi
the devotion that exists between these ou
from civilization anil the servants that
great force has placed within their grasp 
malamutes have shown many a man in a
the meaning of life and the way to draw ji
and happiness from environment and co -
tione that to many were like a dungeon cell
uncomplaining wolf-dogs gladly do they sta
when you starve or that you may eat mi
reading beasts who can hear you think d
with brains that out-guess human beings k
ing is as natural for a wolf-dog as sleepii
killing to protect a loved one is easier do yl
remember old seegar-did the work of sevi
dogs who had gone mad and had to be killed
vet old seegar brought iouis lane safe an
sound into camp but it cost the malamute hi
sight and hearing my yarns are all founde
upon fact once in juno from irish hiu

i	had to sacrifice the truth for fiction 
submitted the story to everybodys they bought
it but said that the pari where juno look five
pups to five different mm on irish hill to bc
cared for in her absence would have to be
changed they said their readers wouldnt stand
for it vet that is exactly what juno did

  and a last editorial word

perhaps it isnt credible but its not al-
ways a pleasant task for a magazine- to
sound its own trumpet ever to state inten-
tions before they have been fully realized car-
ries with it-but lets ret it over with it is
merely this

  a new magazine is not made in a day we
here in the office have no apologies to offer for
romance but our minds are so firmly fixed
upon the romance of a year from now that we
cant quite think of it in only its present stage
we are centered on making it better and bet-
ter a- it goes along to do this we need the
help of your criticism and comment and there-
fore i think we are justified in stating our inten-
tion and definitely iisking for your cooperation
our main field is fiction and better and better
fiction is our main endeavor but there is also
our poetry and it is our ambition to see the
day when romance will stand out among ail
masazines as the one sure placc to find the very
best in contemporaneous verst and nothing but
the very best-a s h
