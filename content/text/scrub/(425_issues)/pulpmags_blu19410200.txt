our war
in the mediterranean

       for many years the rulers of tripoli a igiers and other north
       african states had demanded and received tribute from euro-
       pean nations failing to receive it they attacked and captured
       european ships and enslaved their crews when the newly
       established united states of america found that we too must
       pay tribute-or else-we did not forbid these dangerous medi-
       terranean waters to our sailors instead we built us a navy
       went to war and cleaned up the mediterranean a noted au-
       thority here tells this old but timely story

  by col charles
  wellnigton furlong

ad we been called upon to meet
the dangers of the sea or to fight
the enemies of our country we
should i know like true american sail-
ors have encountered them without dis-
may

  so wrote archibald robbins of weath-
ersfield connecticut in a journal he
published in  telling of the loss of
the brig commerce of hartford aboard
which he was an able seaman this
journal describes the slavery and suffer-
ings of the author and the rest of the
crew upon the sahara desert during the
years   and -three years of
living hell for those who survived

  but he continued after having en-
countered and overcome almost all the
varieties of human misery then to be
cast upon a boundless plain of burning
sand and flinty stones there to be fam-
ished with hunger devoured by wild
beasts or become slaves to the most mer-
ciless of creatures that wear the form of
man was surely enough to appall the
stoutest heart    three or four arabs
seized me and pulled me one way and
another with so much force that i con-
cluded they were about to settle-the dis-
pute by making an equal distribution of
my body among them at length one of
them continued his hold and he now
became my sole master    and led me
off to his camels stationed at a small
distance

  we are acquainted yvith the terrors of
black slavery under the white man which

once ran rampant in the united states
and some of the countries of south amer-
ica but of white slavery under the
arabs and blacks of barbary we know
little and most of that knowledge is
found in the narratives of american sea-
men from the ports and farms of our
atlantic seaboard and privately pub-
lished in limited editions of their jour-
nals such as that of robbins

  the impressing of our seamen by
european powers into their navies in
which the british took the lead as well
as the capture and destruction of our
merchant vessels in the mediterranean
and the enslaving of their officers and
crews by the barbary pirates hampered
our commerce and caused great loss to
shipowners and american trade

  privateers such as the eighty-ton
schooner true blue and the ship essex
of which capt lawrence furlong of
newbury port was commander and prize
master respectively were armed and
sworn into the service

  on may   the american sloop
unity under captain jeremiah obrien
cruising off machias maine captured
the british armed tender marguerita and
lowered the first british flag hauled down
at sea in the revolution    the fol-
lowing september  the armed schooner

hannah from beverly massachusetts
commanded by capt nicholson brough-
ton captured a british vessel the
hannah owned by col john glover of
salem ranks officially as the mother of
the american navy

  the following year the stars and
stripes flag was adopted by the con-
tinental congress old glory was born
and fluttered from the masthead of every
american ship but a government by
free men is always bought at a price
part of that price was paid by the with-
drawal of former british protection to
colonial ships and crews on the high seas
six years later the supreme court of
massachusetts outlawed slavery because
in the state bill of rights was written
that far-reaching and imperishable idea
all men are born free and equal

from ancient times the mediterra-
nean has been the scene of naval strife
and piracy men chained tothe galley-
thwarts have writhed under the lash of
pagan mohammedan and christian the
barbary corsairs particularly the alge-
rines scoured the sea for booty raiding
not only the mediterranean islands the
italian and spanish coasts but those of
ireland and even far-away iceland these
wolves of the sea would descend out of
the night and push inland looting vil-
lages and carrying off defenseless in-
habitants into slavery

  the object of the barbary pirates was
to seize plunder from the ships and
money by ransom of their captive crews
robbins stated in his journal that some
of the captured american sailors of the
commerce were sold on the public auc-
tion block to the desert arabs for as
high as forty camels apiece while ran-
som of  pounds sterling for a single
american captive was disdainfully re-
fused as a mere bagatelle by the more
sophisticated algerines

  against american protests to the en-
slaving of our crews by the algerines and
their exorbitant demands the dey re-
plied  tt has been the custom from time
immemorial for all nations to redeem
their people on the best terms they could

  through the middle of the sixteenth
century the power of the barbary states
was at its height but the crushing defeat
of the turks at lepanto in  which
was really the last crusade put a stop
to their aggression in the eastern medi-
terranean from then on their naval
supremacy began to decline and the line
of the famous barbary corsairs ceased

and degenerated into a race of petty
pirates these marauders continued to
infest the mediterranean until their ex-
termination in the nineteenth century

  before the mediterranean was freed
from jiiracy christian slaves could be
counted by tens of thousands in algiers-
and other cities of barbary at the time
of washingtons presidency the great
maritime powers of europe were paying
an annual tribute to the rulers of the
little piratical states of barbary this
was for freedom from molestation of their
ships and crews in the mediterranean
in fact strange as it may seem they had
been doing this for centuries even
england for  years had paid tribute
through her consuls at algiers and as
late as  english slaves presumably
captured under the flags of other coun-
tries were ransomed in algiers

  after the revolution american mer-
chantmen could no longer claim britains
protection on the high seas in fact at
one time they were actually denied the
use of gibraltar the new flag of the
americans had scarcely appeared in the
mediterranean before the pirates of bar-
bary knew that the ships and crews of
this young weak power beyond the seas
without a navy were an easy prey for
their galleasses xebecs dhows and feluc-
cas attacks particularly by the alge-
rines with the tripolines a close second
now centered on american ships and
secondly on those of italy the sultan
of morocco however showed a friendly
disposition toward u and claimed to
have been the first sovereign to recognize
the independence of the united states

petitions to induce congress to
bring relief or protection to our mer-
chant marine in the mediterranean
seemed to fall on deaf ears but it was
the pleas that american women made to
george washington on behalf of barbary
enslaved husbands sons and brothers
which really initiated the movement for
the freedom of the mediterranean it
was at mt vernon in  that general
washington first learned from them that
a number of american merchantmen had
been captured by certain barbary states
and when payment for the release of the
crews was refused these americans were
sold as slaves washington also learned
something else that other maritime na-
tions headed by england and france
paid tribute to the rulers of barbary and
the sultan of turkey for freedom to sail
the mediterranean without molestation

  this prompted him in a letter to his
good friend lafayette to ask how in
such an enlightened    liberal age   
is it possible that the great maritime
powers of europe should pay an annual
tribute to the little piratical states of
barbary

  there was present at mt vernon at
the time tobias lear formerly wash-
ingtons private secretary but later his
private military secretary who had been
given the rank of colonel lear became
consul-general to algiers in  and
commissioner to tripoli in  when
his actions had a deciding effect on one
of the most dramatic episodes of our
military history in the mediterranean

  but washington was soon to discover
something which american merchantmen
knew all too well that this situation was
in accord with european policy and that
france and england in particular pri-
vately encouraged those islamic rovers
to attack and discourage american com-
merce in the mediterranean to prevent
our competing with their carrying trade

  franklin while minister to france in
 said i have in london heard it
is a maxim among the merchants that
if there were no algiers it would be
worth englands while to build one
then he continued i wonder however
that the rest of europe do not combine
to destroy those nests and secure com-
merce from their future piracies

  this was father to the thought which
washington expressed four years later
to the congress of the united states
when he said to secure respect to a
neutral flag requires a naval force organ-
ized and ready to vindicate it from insult

or aggression  it would seem as if
our trade in the mediterranean without
a protecting force will always be inse-
cure and our citizens exposed to the
calumnies from which numbers of them
have just been relieved  if we desire
to avoid insult we must be able to repel
it ij we desire to secure peace one oj
the most powerful instruments oj our
rising prosperity it must be known that
we arc at all times ready for war

  so a recommendation in congress
that a naval force adequate to the pro-
tection of the commerce of the united
states against the algerine corsairs ought
to be provided took form in january
 and a month later that body author-
ized the construction of six frigates to
uphold our flag and insure our merchant-
men the freedom of the seas in the medi-
terranean but these vessels were only
on order and when in  a treaty
of peace with algiers was signed work
was discontinued on three of the frigates

  in  our senate had favored pay-
ing one hundred thousand dollars annu-
ally for peace to algiers tripoli and
tunis and forty thousand dollars ransom
for the captives it also passed resolu-
tions stating its readiness to ratify trea-
ties with algiers providing for peace at a
cost of forty thousand dollars at the out-
set and annual tribute of twenty-five
thousand dollars

  through the most remarkable vicissi-
tudes of fate our envoy was unable to
consummate this treaty until nearly four
years later and then instead of the
amount originally favored by the senate
that body ratified the cost and payment
of nearly one million dollars including
print from culver service n y

figlit with corsairs on the dock of an
american ship

 for ransom of the thirteen cap-
tives various presents and miscellaneous
expenses even this was exclusive of the
annuity in naval stores at an estimated
value of over twenty-one thousand dol-
lars which later proved far too low

  a treaty with tunis and also with
yusuf karamauli bashaw of tripoli
was likewise ratified at considerable cost
but these treaties with algiers tripoli
and tunis consummated in --
respectively proved unsatisfactory

  william bainbridge a young american
naval officer a captain at twenty-six was
given command of the frigate george
washington of twenty-four guns pur-
chased in  this was in  and
in the fall of the year he passed through
the straits of gibraltar the first united
states man-of-war to enter the mediter-
ranean and soon arrived at algiers his
orders required him to deliver the pay-
ment of tribute to its barbary ruler a
duty repugnant to any naval officer
shortly after bainbridge dropped anchor
the dey demanded that the george wash-
ington carry his ambassador to constan-
tinople together with presents amount-
ing from five to six million dollars and
two hundred turkish passengers bain-
bridge protested

  you pay me tribute said the dey
by which you become my slaves i have
therefore a right to order you as i see
proper it was comply or incur a re-

newal of hostilities against united states
ships and commerce bainbridge com-
plied but later remarked that if he had
to deliver anything more he hoped it
would be at the mouth of a cannon

  other troubles soon developed with the
barbary regencies particularly with
tripoli by the opening of the nine-
teenth century through the violation of
the previous treaties by the barbary
rulers the united states found itself at
war with those powers but at last with
a squadron of warships ranging from the
forty-four-gun flagship president to the
twelve-gun schooner enterprise and in-
cluding the thirty-six-gun frigate phila-
delphia all under the command of com-
modore dale

  the main duty of the squadron was to
protect the american merchantmen and
crews to perform which dale had three
main objectives to give battle to any
armed vessel of the enemy on the high
seas to blockade their ports and to con-
voy american merchantmen the convoy
system required that american merchant-
men particularly those sailing for home
should assemble at certain mediterranean
ports such as alicante barcelona and
marseilles from there on certain dates
the convoy started for home those glo-
rious fleets of sail stand out as one of
the great pageants of history majestic
merchantmen with all sails set the stars
and stripes at the masthead and their
long homeward-bound pennants stream-
ing in the wind convoyed on flanks and
rear by our stately ships of the line
thus they bulged through the straits of
gibraltar along the coast of spain by
that tribute-levying pirates nest tarifa
from which our word tariff is derived
then when well out on the atlantic the
convoy returned and the merchantmen
winged their way for home at no time
did an american mediterranean squadron
comprise more than thirty-one vessels
sixteen of which were small gunboats

  about every year our squadrons on the
mediterranean station changed flagships
and commands and were augmented or
diminished as conditions demanded in
 and  we find commodore preble
in command and his flag flying from the
famous constitution of forty-four guns
captain bainbridge was in command of
the philadelphia and chauncey of the
john adams of twenty-eight guns the
rest of the squadron comprised four
small brigs a couple of large schooners
nine gunboats and two bomb vessels
later a captured turkish ketch renamed
the intrepid and carrying four guns
brought the total to twenty-one vessels

  thus six-sevenths of prebles squadron
comprised small vessels of from four to
sixteen glins this was in strong con-
trast to the previous squadrons under
commodores dale and mortis made up
entirely of good-sized frigates with the
one exception of the schooner enterprise
mounting only twelve guns under lietlt
andrew sterrett but now commanded by
decatur in commodore prebles squad-
ron the reason for this change in ton-
nage and gtins was due to the many reefs
and shoals which abound along the bar-
bary coast particularly off the shores of
tripoli also because barbarian craft
with the exception of some of the alge-
rine galleasses were small lighter-draft
craft which could maneuver and work
along shore where our larger men-of-war
could not safely navigate

  our smaller craft were commanded by
daring young officers who for bravery
and esprit gave a good account of them-
selves and  whose ships lists were
such famous names as stephen decatur
richard somers james lawrence and
others it was here in the mediterranean
that some of our most famous ships saw
service the president and the philadel-
phia the chesapeake and the constitu-
tion the guerriere he constellation the
united states and last the independence
and washington of seventy-four guns
each largest of them all of these histor-
ic frigates the constitution and constel-
lation are still afloat with old ironsides
now actually in commission

of the smaller craft the enterprise
must have been a very useful little
schooner for she was kept on the medi-
terranean station from the very first in
 until  and was brought back
again when hostilities with the algerines
were renewed in  these small craft
fought many dual engagements the
tactics of the arabs were to close in lock
ships with grappling-irons let fall the
long booms of their lateen sails over the
enemys deck and swarming over them
her swarthy crews with knives and cut-
lasses between teeth boarded their en-
emy the tactics of the americans who
were better in handling ships was to
prevent this by maneuvering

  the most famous record hung up by
the enterprise occurred when she was
once running for malta with lieut ster-
rett in command she hove in sight of a
fourteen-gun tripolitan polacca com-

manded by mahomet sous and carry-
ing eighty men an even match for the
enterprise of twelve guns and ninety-
four men time and again the moslem
attempted to board and as often ster-
rett by superior skill out-maneuvered
him time and again choosing his posi-
tion he repeatedly raked the polacca
twice the tripoline rais feigned sur-
render while lowering his flag only to
seize an advantage hoist it again and
reopen fire but after three hours of in-
cessant firing sometimes within pistol-
shot and after losing two-thirds of his
crew in dead and wounded the treacher-
ous rais finally hurled his colors into the
sea and begged for quarter there was
not one casualty aboard the enterprise

    sterrett now dismantled the tripoli-
  tan ship and stripped her of her guns
  then he allowed her crew to creep back
  under an old sail and spar into tripoli
  the bashaw yusuf karamauli promptly
  had maliomet sous paraded through the
  streets on a jackass and then bastinadoed

  tripolitan ships were blockaded to
  the straits of gibraltar but particu-
  larly off the port of tripoli itself the
  american vessels leaving it only in the
  inclement winter season or in a run to
  malta or syracuse for fresh water and
  supplies american sailors made one
  landing to the east of tripoli on an as-
  sault on some breastworks but the port
  of tripoli lay behind a long line of dan-
  gerous reefs here jutting above the
  water there disappearing just below its
  surface about four miles to the east-
  ward lay the hidden kaliusa reef not
  then recorded on any chart safe behind
  these reefs in his impregnable castle
  reigned the despotic yusuf karamauli
  who had declared war against the united
  states cut down the american flagstaff
  and forced our american consul james
  l cathcart to leave tripoli turning
  american interests into the hands of the
  danish consul nicholas nissen

    yusuf and his two brothers hassan
  and hamet were sons of ali karamauli
  bashaw of tripoli all three were in-
  spired by mutual bitter jealousy yusuf
  determined to succeed his father and
  when only twenty murdered his oldest
  brother hassan in  six years later
  when his father died and his weaker
  vacillating brother hamet happened to
  be away yusuf got control of the army
  and proclaimed himself bashaw hamet
  took refuge under the protection of the
  bey of tunis but yusuf held on to
  
hamets wife and children in tripoli as
hostages hamet went subsequently to
malta then to derna in eastern tripoli
and finally retired to egypt

  preble tightened the blockade of trip-
oli and ordered bainbridge with the phil-
adelphia and the little vixen of twelve
guns under lieut commandant john
smith to keep up a watchful cruise off
that port the vixen was sent in the
direction of cape bon to intercept if
possible two tripolitan vessels of war
out upon a cruise and the philadelphia
maintained the blockade alone

  just before two bells of the forenoon
watch on october   when the
philadelphia was about five leagues to
the westward of tripoli lieut porter
came to bainbridges cabin

  there is a strange sail sir standing
close in shore

  bainbridge went immediately on deck
through his glass he made out a felucca
standing before the wind to the westward
and flying tripolitan colors the phila-
delphia immediately gave chase to pre-
vent the felucca from reaching tripoli
in about two hours as they approached
nearer the shore the philadelphia began
firing as she ran before the wind this
was maintained for half an hour but
bainbridge finding his firing at that
range without effect gave up the chase
and wearing ship a bit bore off shore
he had been sailing in eight fathoms and
the chart showed safe water

  seven fathoms  droned the leadsman
-then at another heave of the lead

  by the mark six he called

  port your helm   ordered bainbridge
to head the frigate more quickly out to
sea his perfectly trained crew braced
the yards sharply about as the vessel
answered her helm it was too late
there was a grating sound a terrific
shock and an ominous quiver ran through
the entire ship the philadelphia was
aground hung up on what proved to be
the kaliusa reef but where on the best
available charts no reef was shown the
lead gave twelve feet of water forward
and seventeen abaft from a small-boat
soundings gave the greatest depth of
water astern

  the philadelphia lay about one and
one-half miles offshore and her predica-
ment had been seen from tripoli only
about four and one-fourth miles along
shore westward in an incredibly short
space of time headed by the felucca she
had been chasing eight gunboats put
out from tripoli harbor the wind was

 blowing fresh so the frigates topgallant-
 sails were loosed and all sails laid aback
 for it seemed that under such a heavy
 press of sail on the ship she might be
 backed off to lighten her bow three
 anchors were cast away and water
 started in the hold to weight her aft

  rig the pumps bosun ordered
bainbridge and get the fresh water
overboard

  aye-aye sir replied boatswain
george hadger and in a few minutes
the rhythmic slushing of the big pumps
was spewing their precious drinking
water from the springs of pennsylvania
into the scuppers under thomas moore
the ships carpenter even the forward
water-casks were being stove in by ten
of the crew but the philadelphia did not
give an inch though she now careened to
larboard listing as she was few of her
broadside guns could now be brought to
bear upon the enemy so the guns of the
entire starboard battery and those of the
forward division of the port battery were
hove overboard except some aft retained
to defend the ship against the oncoming
gunboats which were already firing upon
the philadelphia

  break out the stern gallery bain-
bridge commanded cast loose and pro-
vide those two stern chasers

 the two heavy guns were run into
bainbridges cabin and under the direc-
tion of william sweeney chief gunner
they were slewed round as far as possible
to bear on the attacking tripoline gun-
boats but now only three guns out of
her thirty-six could be brought to bear on
the enemy even the fire of these was
shortly rendered useless because the
canny moslems took up positions on
either side just out of the line of fire of
these stern guns

  as a last resort to lighten the frigate
forward her towering foremast was cut
away and in falling it carried the main
topgallant mast with it but all in vain
and what an hour before was a gallant
ship now lay a dismantled defenseless
wreck and surrounded by at least nine

enemy gunboats heavily manned whose
crews were armed to the teeth and who
hung like jackals about a dying lion

  it was now early afternoon for four
hours the tripolines mercilessly poured
their shot and shell at the philadelphia
fortunately they aimed at the masts and
rigging their intention being to prevent
escape under sail and secure her as a
prize this was fortunate and probably
accounts for the lack of casualties among
her complement of three hundred men

  as the sun lowered toward the horizon
those aboard the frigate could see the
long low skyline of the city of tripoli
broken only by the higher stone mass of
the castle of the bashaw and accented
here and there by the graceful minarets
from the mosque of the steps and other
mosques of the faithful little specks
now appeared to break off from the lower
edge of the silhouette grew larger as
they turned into boats and approached
the american frigate these innumer-
able small craft putting out from shore
were filled with men

  as the curtain of night was rung down
on that day of october   bain-
bridge knew that these wolf packs would
the blue book magazine

swarm over the philadelphias sides to
loot and rend and kill it would be a
massacre not a fight the odds were
too much against them so after consult-
ing with his officers he ordered over-
board all small arms flood the maga-
zine tell the carpenter to scuttle the
ship then turning to lieut jones he
gave the hardest order of his life

  mr jones i am sorry sir haul down
the flag

  all hands were mustered on the quarter
deck where bainbridge read a clause
from the articles of war encouraged them
to hope for a ransom and instructed them
to behave with fortitude and circum-
spection and ordered them not to resist
insults or even rough handling which he
knew must follow on the part of the
barbarous enemy who if resisted would
give no quarter the men after collect-
ing their dunnage and belongings retired
to the focsle with some of the junior
officers while bainbridge and the senior
lieutenants stood on the quarter deck

for a short time the tripolines sus-
pectingly hesitated to board fearing a
ruse of a false surrender which they
themselves practiced the sun was sink-
ing behind the battlements of tripoli as
the fierce-visaged turbaned head of a
moor peered cautiously above the bul-
warks a word to those below then a
wild scramble as with shrill cries a mot-
ley horde of swarthy pirates armed to
the teeth poured over the sides their
brandished knives and scimitars glinted
in the last gleams of the setting sun

  the scene that followed beggars de-
scription there seemed to be no leader
in authority and in the pandemonium
that broke loose the plunderers not only
looted the crew of their dunnage and
ditty-boxes but personal possessions and
even clothes stripping them of every-
thing but trousers shirts and hats the
gold epaulettes of the officers in partic-
ular appealed to those oriental sons of
allah and were torn unceremoniously
from the officers shoulders even their
fobs and watches were seized

  william a marine and a native of
northern new york had some pieces of
gold in his vest pocket which he at first
refused to give up but he writes
one of the pirates pushing the muzzle of
a cocked pistol against my breast soon
brought me to terms numerous inci-
dents occurring during that boarding will
neverie recorded but one relating to
bainbridge himself stands out

   bainbridge in both french and italian
 had unsuccessfully called for their leader
 during a lull in the hubbub he caught a
 glimpse of a tall imposing figure looking
 in hisjirection whom he took to be their
 rais advancing toward him he ex-
 tended the hilt of his sword in surrender

  with a swift movement the villain
 grasped the sword making a vicious
 thrust at bainbridges stomach miracu-
 lously the point was deflected harmlessly
 to one side by bainbridges heavy belt
 plate and the man drew back he then
 demanded the heavy pistols and the
 captains belt and proceeded to divest
 bainbridge of his insignia including a
 jeweled pin from his neckcloth

   the two men on the quarterdeck had
 now become the center of attention of
 the crowd gathered to watch in the waist
 of the ship below bainbridge was un-
 flinchingly eying his adversary despoiled
 of his coat and neckcloth his shirt torn
 open at the throat one thought entered
 his mind about his neck suspended on
 a fine gold chain hung a beautiful minia-
 ture of his wife susan

   the gleam of gold caught the pirates
 eye with a swift movement he reached
 for it but bainbridge was still quick-
 er throwing discretion to the winds
 all his pent-up resentment anger and
 disappointment seemed to concentrate in
 his muscular arms as quick as a leopard
 he seized the swarthy moslem as he
 would a bundle of rags and with super-
 human strength hurled him against the
 rail of the ship the mans skull
 cracked like an egg and he fell limply
 down on the heads of the crowd below

 bang went a pistol at point-blank
 range but it missed its mark lts
 porter jones and hunt started forward
 to his side but in a flash their arms were
 pinioned behind them and bound with
 quickly-unwound moslem turbans a
 half-dozen corsairs now fell upon bain-
 bridge down went the first with a blow
 from his powerful fist but they swarmed
 upon him like wolves on a muskox too
 intertwined to draw their daggers down
 to the deck they went but bainbridge
 struggled to his feet and seizing one of
 his assailants by his broad cloth belt
 hurled him overboard

   the terrific struggle continued down
 up down up four times he struggled to
 his feet what the result would have
 been it would be difficult to say but for
 the sudden appearance aboard of a hand-
 somely dressed figure in a brilliant red


our war in the mediterranean

tunic and silk scarf thrusting back
bainbridges assailants he approached
the captain who stood panting defiantly
before him but the moor bowed low
and turning so as to confront the others
he drew a long jeweled pistol to the
relief of bainbridge and his officers they
realized that here was one in authority

  the crowd fell back as he beckoned
bainbridge to follow him led by bain-
bridge who still clutched the miniature
tightly in his hand the officers and crew
were hurried into the enemys boats
during the voyage ashore some of our
men were ordered to man the oars but
the plundering of the sailors still con-
tinued though lessened by darkness at
ten that night they arrived opposite a
broad gap in the middle of the sea wall of
the castle

  and here their real troubles began
the officers were landed but as the surf
made it difficult to beach the boats the
sailors were unceremoniously thrown
headlong into the foaming waves a few
rods from shore with water up to their
armpits and left to struggle or get ashore
as best they could dripping wet and
cold they passed between a row of armed
janissaries who lined the beach and then
through a spitting cursing crowd to the
castle gate a winding dismal passage
through which they ascended led into a
paved avenue within the castle this
was lined with guards armed with sobers
muskets pistols and hatchets a brief
halt and the philadelphias crew and offi-
cers were hurried on through various
turnings and flights of stairs at the top
of which they stepped into a scene that
must have caused some to imagine they
had been transported into the land of the
arabian nights from a pitch-dark pas-
sage lit only by the dull glow of their
guards lanterns the disconsolate three
hundred americans stepped suddenly into
a great palatial hall lit with myriad
clusters of little oil lamps the floor
was of variegated marble and spread with
magnificent carpets it was a palace of
the bashaw within his castle

at the farther end of the hall was a
 richly appointed royal divan about
four feet above the floor and inlaid with
mosaic it was covered with a great cush-
ion of the richest velvet fringed with gold
and glittering with bespangled brilliants
on this throne flanked by a richly

clothed guard of officers sat an imposing
individual of about forty with a long
dark beard that swept his breast he
was dressed in a long blue robe of silk
embroidered with gold

  about his rotund belly was a broad
diamond-studded belt which held two
gold-mounted pistols and from which
by golden chains hung a scimitar of
finest damascus steel with a golden hilt
sheathed in a golden scabbard on his
head he wore a richly decorated white
turban from which two ostrich plumes
waved gracefully in the center of the
turban glistened a jeweled crescent his
manly majestic deportment was worthy
of an oriental potentate and such he
was-the grand bashaw of tripoli yu-
suf karamauli murderer of his brother
ilassan and treacherous to his brother
hamet whose throne he had usurped

  after the pride and curiosity of his
highness was satisfied the americans
were led away bainbridge and his offi-
cers under the immediate surveillance
and responsibility of mr nissen the
danish consul were confined in the for-
mer american consulate

on bainbridges request mr nissen
brought word of the crew whom he
said were in prison in a well-ventilated
quarter of the castle-and they were
from the bashaws presence the crew
were conducted to a filthy apartment in
the castle with scarcely room to turn
around where for nearly two hours they
were kept in their wet clothes then some
of the neapolitan slaves of whom the
bashaw had over one hundred and fifty
brought some of them old ragged but dry
clothes to put on in place of their wet
ones which were never returned the
men were then taken out on to a high
balcony almost opposite the audience
hall one side of this balcony was open
to the cold winds and here our men
many of them still in their wet clothes
were left for an endless night chilled to
the marrow though as mr nissen had
been informed-in well-ventilated quar-
ters of the castle

  this was but the beginning of nineteen
dreary months of slavery and torture
during which most of them survived a
few died and some turned mohammedan
but it was also the beginning of amer-
icas heroic fight for the freedom of the
mediterranean

when the alarm came when
the first bloody spray of war
blew across the low hills be-
side the meuse robert de
baudricourt was riding down the road
through the oak forest with him rode
brother richard a wandering fanatic
preacher whom baudricourt was firmly
escorting out of his villenie or district as
a public menace behind him clattered
along fifteen men-at-arms in armor like
himself

  brother richard was bearded haggard
tattered and had wild mad eyes but he
was no whit mad he was just another
man whom the awful desolation of france
had driven to strange ways baudricourt
found him mildly interesting the stout
captain had a humorous bent though his
humor could take an extremely grim turn
at times

  scarred rock-jawed massive baudri-
court had outlived one wealthy wife and
married another for twenty years he
had almost daily taken death in his stride
and his stride was still firm he was
more than a mere knightly butcher he
was a practical man and was proud of
the fact this was why he now com-
manded vaucouleurs ten miles to the
north and all this district along the
meuse for france-when there was no
france 



  because this story is so timely
  and so impressive ive are inter-
  rupting the series the world
  was their stage and offering
  this in its place

 i warn you doom is close upon you
enemies ring you in cried brother
richard as they rode short are the
days of man that his nights may be
long cracking kinglings from their
thrones the bolts fly on to strike at inno-
cence babes newborn set forth in life
in spasmed rage and fear

  preaching hellfire helps not baudri-
court said amiably thats why im
kicking you out of my lands can ye
see nothing except utter ruin for us all 
can you  retorted the fanatic
baudricourts thin wide lips split in
a grin

  no but im not shouting it abroad
in france a defeatist thats what you
are 

  france mort saint i came the re-
ply such a country no longer exists
the kings dead the dauphin is disin-
herited and driven into the south an
englishman holds paris and is king of
france burgundy his ally holds us
crushed and bleeding why these very
lands of yours are surrounded by ene-
mies on all sides

  true baudricourt waved his hand
at the trees over yonder is a brook
and lorraine the other side of it ger-
mans and english are all around  but the
lilies still fly over vaucouleurs my good
fellow

  theyll soon fall said brother rich-
ard the whole country is enslaved and
dead and shall so remain till all such
bitterment is sweetened on the fuming
mire that blood will make with tears-
oh dry up snapped the captain
im sick of your whine

still it was all true he was no fool
and he knew how horribly right this
fanatic was

der of the duke of burgundy was a

john richard flanagan

fugitive criminal holding only a little
territory in the south in this autumn of
the year  the english ruled in paris
holding all the north and west burgundy
had absorbed most of the other provinces
the french lords had largely turned
traitor

  over the entire country lay a confused
welter of blood and ruin everywhere
was massacre treachery assassination
the open lands were pillaged by wander-
ing bands of mercenaries and vagrant
soldiery law and justice had ceased
the conquerors were tyrants looting
everything that could be carried away
even the art of war had descended to a
murderous slaughter that knew no rules
of chivalry or decency-for chivalry too
was only a memory

yet amid all this horror there was
one gleam of hope as baudricourt
well knew the dauphin had raised one
last army brave help had come from
scotland the old ally of france breton
nobles had come to the aid of the lost
cause troops had been hired from italy
if one battle could be gained a little
corner of the land might yet be saved
from conquest for this baudricourt
and a few others like him still endured

  for this he had saved his few poor
villages from rapine his peasants were
not enslaved they had cattle and har-
vests they were a step above the level of
beasts his heavy sword his heavy
hand had protected them but he knew
how close was the end he did not deny
the facts but he could not afford to have
this wandering fanatic taking theheart
out of his people and his soldiers hence
he was escorting brother richard else-
where after his firm fashion every-
thing robert de baudricourt did was
done firmly

  messire a shout lifted from the
men-at-arms messire a courier 



there is no king the dauphin is a
fugitive the knights and nobles are
dead or traitors the people are en-
slaved foreigners have divided the
land an enemy king rules in paris
france has ceased to exist

-guillaume dorly 

  baudricourt drew rein he saw a man
galloping toward them but knew at once
it was no courier-only a peasant from
the villages ahead a peasant mounted on
a scarecrow horse close to foundering

  messire robert great-eyed with
excitement the peasant cried out his
news a man is in greux a french
knight he is hurt he says raiders are
hard after him in pursuit i rode to
warn you    thanks to the saints that
i met you so soon

  well done and baudricourt turn-
ing calmly to brother richard gave the
fanatic one shove that rolled him half
out of the saddle dismount quickly 
thats right walk on to the village
ahead its only a mile rejoin us
there he beckoned the peasant here
man take this horse ride on to vau-
couleurs order the seneschal to send
fifty men to meet me and to prepare the
town for siege have the villages been
warned 

  yes messire the kine are gathered
and everyone is taking to the islands

  the peasant scrambled into the saddle
and spurred for vaucouleurs baudri-
court gestured to his men pricked his
steed and plunged ahead at a gallop
leaving brother richard to trudge after

  the oak forest thinned ahead to dis-
close the roofs of houses the two vil-
lages of greux and domremy came into
view to the left was the broad sweep
of the meuse splitting around several
islets and swelled by the autumn rains
spreading out in shallow ponds beneath
the hillside vineyards

piles of cattle were splashing toward
the islands accompanied by men and

women and children laden with bundles
-peasants quick to flee the bloody rap-
ine boded by the advent of any armed
men

baudricourt ignoring these pounded
on into the deserted village of greux at
full tilt

  a few belated peasants were on the
run for the rivef in the center of the
hamlet was the village well beside it
stood a jaded horse legs apart and head
hanging and in the saddle a man bare-
headed bandaged most of his armor
gone a child a village girl of twelve

 upon him the sergeant jehan and four
 riders had clattered out of the village
 the other men had disappeared

  enemy you say he inquired
 what enemy this is france

   not for long said henri du gard
 swigging at the wine with a sigh of re-
 lief ah thats good stuff    dye
 mean to say you havent heard the news
 what news how the devil are we
 to get news with all pilgrimages stopped
 no more peddlers coming through all
 travelers waylaid by murder what
 news i ask 

   why news that the pleasant land of
  france is no more a grimace shook
 gard the red wine dribbled on his chin
 like blood i was with the dauphin-
 a madman disinherited done for we
 met them at verneuil-

   you were with the army cried bau-
 dricourt eagerly dear god a battle
 you say

   aye it was like agincourt scarcely
 a man escaped two of us got the dau-
 phin away where he is now no one
 knows the scots were exterminated i
 dont think one of them remained alive
 those english arrows were terrible the
 armys gone france is gone

   he paused to drink again and went
 on

   id have reached here alive but these
 raiders caught me up yesterday and have
 been hot after me ever since they got
 an arrow into me this morning it did the
 work and as he spoke he tapped his
 surcoat then he sighed again and re-
 laxed wearily

   baudricourt scarcely heard he stood
 stiffly staring at nothing this frightful
 news left him stunned not for long
 the phrase reiterated by gard was like
 a death-knell

   so the last hope was destroyed france
 had collapsed utterly and finally

 it had been bound to come of course
 torn by dissension by treachery by
 internecine strife the country had gone
 to pieces utterly decadent it had no
 rulers no strong men no leaders the
 people were pillaged the peasants were
 mere savages towns and churches were
 burned or plundered on all sides it was
 the end of the world as many thought
 now with the last little hope quite gone
 it was certainly the end of france

   is there nothing i can do for you
 baudricourt looked up and spoke quietly

   nothing replied gard im in no
 pain but i want to die like a knight in

  the saddle not lying on the earth like

  a stricken animal

    no messages i might send

    to whom ive nothing left my
  wife my family-all destroyed by the
  burgundians my home my castle
  everything now im passing and its
  rather a relief the hurt man smiled a
  little ill bequeath you the task of
  rebuilding france robert

    you rightly said that france is gone
oh that has happened before ant it
will happen again 

 baudricourt ignored the words
 he thought that gards mind must be
 wandering

     there was a shuffle of feet and toward
  the well came brother richard striding
  along strongly as he approached bau-
  dricourt broke into a bitter laugh

     well youre free to go your ways you
  ranting rogue ive other matters afoot
  look at the fellow henri he preaches
  hellfire and utter loss-and hes right
  brother richard halted at the well
  drank from the bucket on the coping and
  gave them a look that was like a sword

    i preach only retribution he said
  and the consuming vengeance that the
  lords of life bring upon a wicked people
  who is to save france no one small
  men in great places throw long shadows
  but bulk low on the horizon only by the
  suns sinking are they made fearsome
  france is lost none can save her now
  she is only a memory

    baudricourt laughed the rogue has
  a gift of gab henri you have book-
  learning  make him some answer whos
  to save france

    every question has an answer if one
  only knew it said henri du gard per-
  haps i could tell you the answer to this
  question good robert they say that the
  man who has lost everything except life
  and is about to lose even that sees very
  clearly

    baudricourt peered up curiously he
  knew that this henri baron du gard
  had lived hard and had delved into many
  things student wild roistering knight a
  chivalric fellow of the old school that
  was now dead gard had queerly strong
  abilities being himself a practical man
  of his hands and little able to read or
  write baudricourt had always held gard
  in much respect and now he was living
  on and gard was dying

    then all in an instant every thought
was swept away with the clash of armor
and the ringing heels of a horse sergeant

a france forever

jeharrcame riding hard to draw rein be-
fore them

  messire it is a parley a knight
called the damoiseau de craon and ten
men-at-arms he has halted a quarter-
mile down the road he demands per-
mission to bring his men on here to
speak with you

  so he demands baudricourts
glance flitted about the little market-
place and fastened on the village forge
it stood at the right under two towering
oaks let him come jehan his men
are to halt yonder by the forge you
and your four men stay here by the well
keep mounted keep your swords loose
go

  jehan swung around and clattered off
baudricourt called sharply one of his
hidden men came into sight baudricourt
went toward him they met and talked

  brother richard drank again from the
well-bucket gard munched slowly at a
crust of bread and gulped occasionally
at the wine-bottle from somewhere over
the oak forest came a thin distant sound
of alarm bells from other villages drift-
ing across the autumn sunlight was the
lowing of cattle from the river islets
baudricourt came back and his man van-
ished again from sight

  whos this damoiseau de craon
baudricourt growled i cant place
him

  a french knight in english service
said gard he has a bad name for
treachery but hes an able man sorry i
cant use a sword robert afraid my
strengths going

  no need baudricourt rejoined
devil take it im a good hand at band-
aging wounds-

  so am i said gard smiling faintly
let me go my way in peace

  baudricourt shrugged and complied
brother richard came to the foundered
horse took the leather wine-bottle-emp-
ty now-from gard filled it with water
from the well-bucket and handed it up
again to the dying man baudricourt
watched this and wondered because it
was all done in silence as though the
tattered fanatic had read gards mind

now they were coming hoof-beats
reechoing from the empty houses
jehan and his four men riding straight
across to the well and remaining there in
a clump of steel craon alone full-armed
but with his vizor open more slowly ap-
proaching the well-behind his ten men-
at-arms grouping at the village smithy

under the big oaks but not dismounting
as hard-riding men should instead they
held the saddle waiting

  baudricourt walked his horse forward
a truce ive heard of you craon
ive heard of you baudricourt
craon showed white teeth in a smile and
drew rein aye a truce  i want that
man yonder hes my prisoner for
ransom

  congratulations messire i thought
i was dealing with the damoiseau de
craon pardon the error naturally i
failed to recognize the good god him- 
self

  craon bit his lip then broke into a
laugh his face framed in steel showed
long and narrow and intolerant the pu-
pils of his eyes surrounded by white
cruel eyes

  aye these are still your lands i be-
lieve he said quite surprising too i
didnt know there were any such lands
left in france with tilled fields with
real cattle and fat ones and even the
village houses unpillaged its a novel-
ty indeed

his gaze rested on the five men-at-
arms touched on brother richard
and gard and came back to the steady
eyes of baudricourt he relaxed and
spoke with sudden warmth

  let the man go then there are great-
er things afoot ive come to offer you
friendliness and new allegiance baudri-
court youve heard that the dauphins
army was entirely destroyed at verneuil 
you know what that means

  you flatter me said baudricourt
no one has told me as yet

  well it means that youre lost sur-
rounded as your district is by our terri-
tory  well probably make a treaty with
your dauphin leave him a little strip to
rule in the south and take the rest eng-
land and burgundy are now supreme in
europe theyll be so for the next five
hundred years france is no longer a
country

  strange said baudricourt her
flag was flying over vaucouleurs this
morning

  dont be absurd craon said testily
henry of england rules france weve
given him allegiance half the lords of
france have done so the rest are dead
the dauphin has been declared a crimi-
nal and all oaths given him are dis-
solved so give me your hand on it
swear to support king henry and youll
not be disturbed in your fief in fact i


can promise you an extension of your
lands and further rewards

  rewards for what  asked baudri-
court is reward the proper word to
use 

  craons face darkened no nonsense
baudricourt he said crisply im of-
fering you security

  oh this is my security as he
spoke the captain clapped his sword-hilt
however ill grant theres sense in
what you say eh henri you heard
as a practical man should i accept

they looked at gard his stubbled
face was very white and beaded with
sweat but he could still smile

  why yes  he replied i think you
should undoubtedly however ill make
you an offer myself robert may i bid
againsfyou sieur de craon

  if you can said craon curtly his
weary cruel eyes were dangerous

  gard gestured slightly perhaps i
offer you france baudricourt a france
that no longer exists but that will exist
none the less she shall be yours to work
upon and to upbuild this is as certain
as tomorrows dawn

  baudricourt frowned he did not un-
derstand these words at all but he re-
solved to humor a dying friend

  explain he said theres no longer
a france for which to fight this is true
how then can france endure riddle
me this henri of gard and ill consider
the matter

  from brother richard listening came
a harsh laugh

  aye play with tricky words but
what are the facts evil has ridden this
land too long and retribution is come
it cannot be fended off france is now



wltli the impact of baudrl-
courts blow the steel shiv-
ered in his hand hut lie felt
it drive home deep through
armor and flesh
a place where shrinking shadows huddle
at the shanks of clowns who stride the
valley in which pigs wallow retribu-
tion has come has come 

you are wrong said gard his voice
firming look here come two children
bring the girl to me friend lift her
up that i may show you something

as they turned they saw that the little
 girl who had disappeared among the
trees was returning she held by the
hand a younger child-a boy obviously
she had found the brother whom she
sought

  brother richard called them to him
while baudricourt looked on frowningly
and the scornful eyes of craon touched
them all and the five men-at-arms who
sat their horses beside the well

  brother richard spoke fb the child
she smiled and he lifted her in his arms
and stood beside the dying horseman

  robert you forget something said
henri du gard perhaps it is something
you do not know in the days of the
gauls france was a great nation the
romans came destroyed and built again
built a greater civilization this in turn
was destroyed france still existed she
became the home of chivalry and song
and culture this has all been wiped
away today but it cannot die france
cannot die france is still yours robert
to fight for

  i dont see why baudricourt said
bluntly i dont know what youre talk-
ing about

  gard smiled at the child and gripped
his saddle-bow to steady himself

  why robert look into the eyes of
this girl do you see nothing there
purity innocence-yes but something
more a thing that cannot perish or
change a thing that must survive all
blood and tears and injustice and tor-
the blue book magazine

ment and damnation look in her eyes
robert you must see it 

  puzzled baudricourt looked at the
child met her eyes met her smile

  devil take me if i can see anything
here here he caught gards deathly
face and swaying figure urged his horse
forward and passed an arm about the
hurt mans shoulders lean against me
henri-

  oh my stirrups arent broken yet
gard straightened a little and his qua-
vering voice took on strength robert
you must see it you must the will of
man to survive the greatness of mans
spirit the thing that cannot be crushed
out of existence-the ideal the ideal
the intellectual truth-

  he slumped all of a sudden his voice
was gone and he fell over in baudri-
courts arms he was dead

  brother richard set the child down
reached up and lowered the limp figure
to the earth

  take those children to the islet   
get out  blared baudricourt quick
or ill have my men prick you on your
way quick 

brother richard gave a hand to each
child and strode away with them
baudricourt looked down at the dead man
crossed himself and muttered a prayer
in upon it broke the voice of craon

  a touching scene my dear baudri-
court children a tattered rascal a dy-
ing man too bad i wasted so much
effort chasing him i wouldnt have had
any ransom after all eh still you and
i have ceased to be impressed by death
he was a great man this henri du
gard said baudricourt slowly in his
youth he did many foolish things some-
times that makes a man wise in his later
years

  craon shrugged no doubt how-
ever hes now but a lump of clay as we
all shall be the main thing is to reach
that hopeless state as comfortably as
possible and not until it is necessary
baudricourt glowered at him the
man caused a savage resurgence within
him a feeling he could not help or under-
stand

  what are you driving at  he growled
your process of thought if you have
one craon retorted your reason-to
put it on a practical basis that you may
understand baudricourt your own im-
mediate future are you to live or die
the stout captain drew down his brows
is that a threat

  craon shrugged as he replied

  give me your hand swear to hold
vaucouleurs for henry of france thats
wisdom its really the only thing you
can do the roads are all closed behind
you-ride forward or die 

  baudricourt grunted he began to see
what was coming as he had foreseen its
possibility long since and it stirred all
his lurking sense of humor a humor
one must admit peculiar to him and as-
suredly of a quaintly grim aspect but
none the less humor a smile curved his
wide lips as he looked at craon

  what was it he was talking about
just now some sort of hope for france
i dont pretend to understand his
ravings craon said disdainfully

  well i dont myself i was never
much good at this sort of argument still
if he said it then thats enough for me
baudricourt declared amiably

  never mind all that you have five
men here i have ten craon smiled
thinly and touched his sword-hilt even
to you the implication must be obvious
come dont be a stubborn fool baudri-
court i like you together we might
go far

  ha you spoke the truth there
baudricourt grinned whats farther
than hell

  come no nonsense craon rapped
out the words with sudden vehemence
your hand or your sword  which shall
it be

  the stout captain affected to gape at
him round-eyed

  why messire youd never break your
truce you a noble knight here on
your pledged word

  devil take you snarled the other
youre caught and you know it im
giving you the chance to escape with life
and honor take it i advise you
you should know said baudricourt
your advice should be good i admit
you swore fealty to your prince and
deserted him you serve the enemy of
your country and people but black with
treachery as you are youd never break
your knightly word and try to take ad-
vantage of a poor honest fellow like me 

craon lost his temper an oath es-
caped him he caught at his reins
and sent his horse around in one wild
plunge

  forward his voice drove out at
his men while he freed the blade at his
saddle forward  at them on them
no quarter


baudricourt pounded oil into hie
village of greux a shout burst from
him gard henri du gard

  with a yell his ten men-at-arms put in
spurs and surged out into the market-
place a wild laugh burst from baudri-
court he had his own big sword cleared
and he sent his steed straight at craon

  forward he bellowed for st
remy forward

  his long sword clanged on craons
armor blade met blade-huge heavy
shearing steel that must meet and parry
unless a man were to be cut asunder
here was skill the skill of years craons
edge hammered at the helm of baudri-
court and he realized he had an oppo-
nent who knew his business the two
of them were wholly engaged with each
other blinded to all around staking life
or death on eye and wrist and-arm

  but they were not deafened those
yells had suddenly turned to shouts to
shrill and panicked screams as the ten
men-at-arms came driving at the five be-
side the well other men erupted from
among the houses-the hidden riders
hurtling out to take the attackers in the
rear cut them to pieces

  now welled up a clangor of steel on
steel screams of horses and men as
sword and dagger bit home oaths and
shouts and groans as man and beast
fought in mad frenzy about the well-cop-
ing with no quarter asked or given and
aside from the dusty flurry of the mass
fought the two captains

for once baudricourt had met his
match a thing that seldom happened
almost at the first onset he cut the reins
of craon but the latter had trained his
steed to be guided by knee and spur the
strategy was lost work the heavy
swords clashed and sparkled twice bau-
dricourt reeled under blows that dented
his helm but the steel held he hewed at
the knights armor-joints hewed desper-
ately and vainly while he fended such a
fury of attack as he had never before
met

  steel-sinewed as he was the weight of
armor and of sword began to tell he
the blue book magazine

called into play all his craft all his
shrewd experience yet time and again
death missed him by a hot breath he
was failing and knew it not his spirit
was yielding but his body was giving
down   

  then in a moment in the very moment
of disaster came a slim chance

craon finding himself fallen into his
own trap was a blazing madman if
this aided the frenzy of his attack it left
him unable to await certain victory he
brought down his blade not at the man
but at the horse the heavy edge sheared
deep into the beasts neck

  and before he could free the sword
baudricourt struck back-struck with a
lift of his body in the stirrups struck as
his horse quivered and leaped in death
struck as he himself went pitching head-
long with the impact of that blow the
steel shivered in his hand but he felt it
drive home at last deep through armor
and flesh

  then he was down crashing in the
dust rolling away from kicking heels and
hoofs luckily he was not full armed
else he had been unable to rise he
dragged himself up a little fumbling for
his dagger his eyes cleared there was
his horse its blood gushing in the dust
there was craon too dragging in his
stirrup a shard of steel sticking out of
his throat as the blood spurted no need
of the dagger now

  and here came a man running another
man-two of his own fellows pulling him
to his feet three or four of the enemy
had broken clear and were in flight at full

fallop with half a dozen of his men pelt-
ng after them the others were dying or
dead he had lost four men no more it
proved

  he staggered to the well-coping and
sank down there ridding himself of the
dented helm he was farther gone than
he cared to admit dully he watched
while the dead raiders were plundered
then as jehan brought up the steed of
craon from whose body the armor was
being stripped baudricourt nodded and
smiled and was himself

  a good days work jehan said he
eying the horse a better steed thart
mine own and better armor--damned
good armor in fact worth a small for-
tune-milanese if im any judge it
took all i had to give    thanks to st
remy the last blow won 

  and a good sword said jehan re-
trieving craons weapon judging by
what it did to your helm its a very
worthy sword messire 

  aye baudricourt hefted it with
shrewd hand you say well look out
for the body of my friend henri du gard
we must take him home for christian
burial cart the others out to the edge
of the forest the wolves will rid us of
them tonight send word to the people
that they can return to their villages
he sighed and leaned back against the
well-curb he was horribly weary and a
bit bruised too even his iron body felt its
hurts his mind drifted perhaps he had
done a foolish thing this day perhaps
it would have been better to accept what
was offered security and strength and
rewards   

  no by st remy he muttered
gard was right t dont know just why
he was right i dont know what the devil
he saw in the childs eyes but he was
right i swore fealty to france and ill
keep the flag of france flying above
vaucouleurs until satan himself comes
to pull it down-and after

presently he looked up one of
the villagers had come and wanted
speech with him-not a man of greux
but of the other village named for st
remy baudricourt nodded and looked
at the fellow with dull gaze his head
hurt and his eyes hurt

  well well what is it he demanded
my children messire came the
agonized response i was away in the
forest came back to find everyone gone
my children not there i have not sfeen
them

  eh  eh  baudricourt passed a hand
across his eyes and looked again why
i should know you of course youre
jacques from domremy    your chil-
dren yes theyre safe i sent them to
the islet the little girl-whats her
name

  jeanne messire

  yes i remember a nice name a nice
name muttered baudricourt jeanne

-and youre jacques darc of course

give me your arm jacques thats
right i must be getting along home   
a good days work but im damned stiff
all the same    what he could see in
her eyes i dont know

  he mounted and rode away mumbling
a nice name that of jeanne darc

a light-hearted rapscallion gets more than was coming to him

by francis cockrell

the roadster poked its shining
nose into maryland and rolled
pleasantly through the coun-
tryside the young man driving
it whistling cheerful little tunes up into
the air for the wind to catch and bear
back away from him

  at the drug-store in a tiny town he
came to presently he stopped and as he
entered a man arose from one of the ta-
bles in the interior dimness and came
forward he was a short man with a
cherubic face and wore a derby and a
dark gray suit

  mr carster he inquired politely

  why-yes thats right bradford
carster watched the others face rather
guardedly

  but he only nodded looking up be
nignly i am jason sir he said hav-
ing told you to inquire the way here
when colonel ranken was in town earlier
today he decided it might be more con-



venientif i remained to direct you per-
sonally if you are ready-

  oh-why sure brad agreed that
was nice of him

  outside jason held the door open for
him and then trotted around and got in
on the other side they bowled out of
town and on through more of maryland
lovely country brad remarked
indeed it is sir jason agreed and
added a bit sourly if one cares for that
sort of thing

  i can take it or leave it alone brad
said

  it was warm for late fall jason re-
moved his derby and patted his brow
and rehatted himself carefully before he
spoke again

  i believe he said then that we
have met before perhaps you recall it
sir at the caggarts about two years
ago it seems if memory serves me right
you were a bit of a rotter sir
tlie colonel was showing several large objects-woofles i
believe he termed them

  brad turned a look of mild indignation
upon him indeed he said coolly

  oh positively sir i unquestionably
i was butler at the caggarts at the time
and i remember it quite well you were
taking young merton at billiards i be-
lieve you had some larger swindle stew-
ing with old mr caggart but it is the
billiards i recall most clearly your
stroke looked so clumsy and lucky but
underneath was actually so practiced and
deft it was delightful he said remi-
niscently he gave brad and the car an
estimating glance well he said you
seem to have been thriving since then
sir doing nicely you might say what 
oh brad said i get it then he
looked at jason suddenly but its no
good my greedy kewpie if you think
simply because i happened to be lucky at
billiards once you can blackmail me-
oh no sir jason gasped oh not
at all sir i wouldnt think of that
he looked as aghast as if accused of
grave-robbing and terribly hurt

  then why bring it up brad asked
a bit testily even if you werent in
error about me which you are of course
why bring it up if you didnt intend-
he stopped fixing jason with an icy
gaze i do hope youre not a gossip
oh no sir jason again hastily as-
sured him by no means but there
was something i had--well you see sir
i thought- he ran a finger around in-
side his collar before he continued  that
is if you had been doing well i thought
possibly you might be considering-a
valet-and that you might consider-my
application sir jason was regarding
him with a sort of pink anxious look



  little crinkles formed at the corners
of brads eyes i dont get it he said
why me

  i suppose jason said that i must
simply have a disreputable streak in me
sir i dont know why but there has
always been this shady side to my nature
which i cannot eradicate-always this
deep keen longing to be valet to some
young gentleman not strictly on the up-
and-up but at the same time one not
an out-and-out crook if you get the dis-
tinction sir someone in short like
yourself sir

  what makes you think im like that
brad asked

  oh you-you just are is all sir and
the way you handled young merton for
instance taking him only for three hun-
dred which he could afford even though
the temptation to clean him entirely
must have been great-the irritating re-
pulsive little twerp

  hmmm brad said keeping his eyes
on the road

  probably too jason added judicial-
ly the cinema has influenced me to a
degree mr eric blore and mr ernest
cossart particularly when they have
been gentlemen to somewhat shady gen
tlemen on the screen have-oh they have
seemed to be enjoying it so if you see
what i mean sir they seemed to be
having such a lovely exciting time and
to be such a help to their masters in
their underhanded pursuits

after a moment brad turned and
 looked at jason then he grinned
jason its a deal you see you sort
of fill out a picture of mine too
  jason was delighted oh splendid 
he said oh splendid sir 

  by the way brad said i just met
colonel ranken at the dog-show ben-
ton griggsby introduced us the colo-
nel was showing several large objects
himself-woofies i believe he termed
them

  newfies sir jason said a diminu-
tive for newfoundland not a bad dog
if one cares for bulk

  uh-huh brad said anyhow i
admired the fellows and we were soon
bosom pals and he said he had lots more
and i should come down and see them
and i said id love to and he said this
week-end by all means and here i am
is there any family he asked besides
the colonel 

  well sir jason said with some feel-
ing briefly yes

pretty soon which was about four
oclock in the afternoon they turned
in between big stone pillars there
were also many rods of those white wood
fences that look so swell green rolling
fields and at the end of a mounting drive
among a bunch of big trees on a hill a
big white house with columns across its
front and on its porch an old gentleman
with a sort of curve to him starting at
his ankles and going all the way up so
that from the side he looked like half a
parenthesis he had a shock of thick
silky hair and a pair of bright but some-
what vague and oddly darting blue eyes

  what a lay-out brad murmured un-
der his breath to jason as he got out he
went around the car grinning broadly
holding out his hand colonel ranken 
how are you sir

  fine dandy colonel ranken said
shaking brads hand this is milli-
cent he went on as daughters began
coming out of the door onto the porch
and this is laura and this is sarah and
this is doris these werent just daugh-
ters either these were luscious-looking
high-class daughters if brad had ever
seen any starting about thirty and work-
ing down to doris somewhere just past
twenty

  how do you do how do yoitdo how
do you do how do you do said brad
how do you do it he added to the
colonel

  henrietta the colonel went on as
around the corner of the porch came a
number in overalls eating an apple with
a smudge on her nose and hair that was
loose and curly just sort of growing out

of her head you might say without any-
one to tell it which way to grow

  this is bradford carster my dear
the colonel said

  dad where is that spray stuff said
henrietta

  unnnffh said brad weakly and un-
intentionally but she looked at him then

  never mind the spray stuff she mur-
mured to her father and reached out a
hand and took one of brads in it and
led him toward the door i guess id
better show you to your room she said
leading him through the door hanging
onto his hand all the time and looking up
at him as they went with blue eyes as
vague and bright as her fathers as she
now and then took a musing nibble from
the apple   

  jason was helping him dress but brad
was hardly aware of it he stared vaguely
here and there but he couldnt see a
thing except what was inside his head

  jason he said why jason that girl
has got-why shes the most-jason
other girls simply cant-just the way she
walks is-and then that look in her eyes
-shes absolutely the most-why jason
there just isnt any question about it

  the first three or four times this had
happened jason had contrived some re-
ply now he just held brads trousers out
to him

  imagine brad breathed finding
something like her on a farm 

  an estate sir jason corrected mildly

  its a farm to me brad said he
went to the window and stood looking
out down toward big barns where there
were riding-horses and dairy cattle and
on across fields green with pasture or gold
with crop to the long orchard rows if
you raise stuff he said its a farm and
its work

vou sound rather bitter sir jason

  x said not in a prying tone but with
an evident readiness to listen

  i grew up on one brad said ja-
son he went on out in missouri when
i was a kid i used to walk along behind
those damn mules when it was hot-
daylight till dark jason and heat you
wouldnt believe work you wouldnt be-
lieve-and id think about when i was
grown up id have a rolls roadster and
a manservant like you and clothes and
an easy way of living-never turn a hand
jason just live by my wits and let the
other guy hustle and toil bound by con-
ventional morality now ive got it-
ive got it all and what happens
the blue book magazine

i tell you jason its pretty grim fates
trumped my trick with a grisly ace
rather than agreeing with him jason
seemed quite pleased about something
there you are sir he said thats
what i meant the heart of gold beating
beneath the ruthless grasping exterior
i knew you were that way you wouldnt
swindle anyone for more than he could
afford for instance or anyone who didnt
think he was cheating you its that
same sort of-sort of robin hood streak
in you sir that wouldnt let you marry
miss henrietta oh most gallant sir 
hell brad said shes so wonderful
i couldnt even defraud anyone in her
family except he added gloomily
possibly a few hundred for expenses
maybe

  of course jason said    there
i think that does it sir

  brad stood in front of the mirror and
surveyed himself well he said not



  it was just as they were coming in from
the long side porch where they had had
cocktails she had on an evening gown
of some kind of white stuff that looked
sort of like fuzz or smoke or mist or
something swirling around and after her
with that beautiful live eager face above
it the effect was incredible she looks
like a hot angel brad thought what
do you know about that a hot angel
how nice dear to see you out of those
overalls her mother said

  yes laura agreed youre no blot
on the landscape really when tubbed a
bit et cetera

  her father met her at the foot of the
steps and tucked her arm through his
charming my dear he said charm-
ing	
she just smiled sort of dreamily i
thought mr carster might like it she
said slipping her hand from her fathers
arm and through brads at which point

charles chickering

  youve made yourself as you are now
-from a farm lad  jason asked admir-
ingly most remarkable 

  brad shrugged just keep your eyes
open go to the right places listen to the
right people read the right things work
at it and dont try to take it too fast
its not much of a job but now he re-
peated ive got it and what happens
and he began answering himself before
jason got his eyebrows more than half-
way up in an interested look

  i run into a girl like this he said bit-
terly thats what just right now
just this very minute with everything
perfect here comes this matchless in-
credible creature its punishment i
guess for being a heel jason a rogue
i cant even hope for her i cant even
dream a dream she couldnt see a guy
like me even if she could theres noth-
ing i could do about it i couldnt let her
throw herself away on a number like me

bad for a farmer i guess that old un-
mistakable look of class of the gentle-
man anyhow eh jason

  oh much more than that jason as-
sured him no real gentleman ever
lookecllhat much like a gentleman sir
youre better than good

  hmmm brad said well-better
watch me then dont let me get too
good jason

swirling she descended the steps
or maybe it was just that looking at
her made brads head swirl at any rate
the effect was of swirling and thats what
counted her family and the others
seemed somewhat impressed also

  in addition to colonel ranken and the
four other daughters there were mrs
ranken two brothers of mrs rankens
named ralph and alpji and a sprinkling
of other guests chiefly men invited prob-
ably to even things up 
rogues holiday

brad went into an open-face long-term
trance his only retort being a mufiled
item which sounded as much like gu-
lunk as anything

  there was a good deal of sitting around
and having highballs and talking and
singing and dancing that night with a
flock of large dogs weaving a pattern
through everything but brad was aware
only of henrietta and kept as close to
her as he could which was no trouble
since she did not try to evade him prac-
tically at all it was pretty good and
close too a couple of times when they

love had knocked him kicking he not
only couldnt think of anything but hen-
rietta he didnt want to think of any-
thing but henrietta and besides that
she deserved it she was like no other
girl she was all girls in overalls in eve-
ning dress in riding-habit at a dozen
different times she was a dozen different
girls and every time she was just the
right one too

  merely discovering that she existed
and thinking how sad it was he could nev-
er win her had been bad now it was
much worse for now it was pretty evi-

were alone the main one being while she
was telling him good-night at one end
of the dark porch with her arms tight
around his neck his own arms were
not waving aimlessly in the atmosphere

  but its hardly midnight brad said

  i know but i have to get up and
milk

 you mean cows brad said how
many 

  about forty but we have a machine
i just supervise

  ill be there brad said

he was too and after that they had
breakfast together and then went
riding being maryland there was a
good deal of riding during the day of
course but brad and henrietta didnt
wait for the others

  they went off with a great dane and
an irish wolf-hound loping along for
company and didnt get back until late
for lunch they went all over tfie estate
which was most considerable and hen-
rietta showed him this and that she
seemed to know something about it all
but not too much

  by the time brad went upstairs after
lunch to change to his swimming-trunks
he was in a bad way it was plain that

f



dent that she looked on him with more
than mild favor and if she was to be
saved from throwing her life away on
such as he then he was the one who
would have to do the saving

  a tall order he thought as he went
down to the pool a wonderful chance
for failure there things sure were
ghastly

  she was sitting on the edge of the pool
waiting for him dressed in a swimming-
suit which confirmed some suspicions he
already had and left nothing whatever
to be desired but henrietta

  a newfoundland and great pyrenees
both huge and almost identical except
that one was jet black and the other snow
white swam with them and chased sticks

  mr gladstone will chase me she
told him and brad threw her out into the
pool and sure enough mr gladstone
the newfie swam out and took her gently
by the arm and towed her to the bank
looking modestly proud and capable
about it

  he loves to save lives she said we
used to have to lock his father up some-
times because he saved lives so hard no-
body could swim and if there was a big
crowd and he couldnt keep everybody
pretty well saved he would get so wor-
ried and frantic he almost had a nerv-
ous breakdown once

  they moved to a table under a big um-
brella and had highballs with the colonel
and ralph watching the other daughters
and the assorted young men who had just
converged on the pool brad told the
colonel he certainly did have a stunning
batch of daughters

  youd think some of em would get
married wouldnt you  the colonel in-
quired sooner or later i always try
to keep a bunch of young men around
handy but it never seems to do much
good they sure eat a lot and wear a lot
of clothes he added plaintively dogs
are way cheaper

alph came along and mixed himself a
 highball and sat down with a deep
sigh he was probably tired the colonel
said he ran the place he had a talent
that way

  how you going to come out this year
alph

  under ten alph said proudly im
sure of it

  its science the colonel said hes
scientific

  you mean youll make under ten
something brad asked politely

  alph looked pitying lose he said
you dont make anything on farms if
you run them right he explained pa-
tiently we lose less than ten thou-
sand this year

  owi brad yelped he couldnt help
it it just got him why with a lay-out
as diversified as this you ought never to
lose and with prices the way they are
now-

  alph regarded him mildly a moment
and then remarked to ralph and the col-
onel one of those radicals i guess
probably wants to overthrow the govern-
ment

  but henrietta was interested are
you sure she asked really could
you make money on it

brad shrugged sure theres no
get-rich-quick about it and theres lots
of work but people do it you know
gee henrietta said thats very in-
teresting

  presently she drifted off toward the
house with a couple of young men and
the newfoundland following her

  what business are you in young radi-
cal alph inquired politely

  brads reply was more or less auto-
matic routine he wasnt really thinking
about it well he said i guess im
looking for a job i thought i was fixed
up with some oil-stock i bought-the
man was sure there was oil there but
now i just heard there isnt any oil at all
nothing but manganese he added sad-
ly whatever that is

  what colonel ranken squeaked
then he quickly became very casual

  jason brad said when jason came
in while he was dressing for dinner hon-
estly jason this is the damnedest family
i ever saw alph losing dough on the
farm and all i do is just mention the
oil-stock-manganese gag to the colonel
and i swear it jason he practically took
the stuff away from me look he
waved a check for twenty thousand dol-
lars before jason can you believe it
oh easily sir jason said

  i feel kind of guilty brad said
you know

  not guilty enough to return the check
i trust jason said anxiously

  no not that guilty but guilty

  i wouldnt worry about it sir jason
said the colonel will never miss it
maybe not but just the same jason
if youre going with me dont lie abed in
the morning ill probably be off with
the dawn he shook his head i dont
trust myself he said darkly around
that girl no telling what i might do
but hed have this one more night this
final fling these last few hours to sam-
ple ecstasy before he faded sourly into
the morning mist

  it was quite a night too because it
was all henrietta as far as brad was
concerned and vice versa others did
various things some danced some rode
in the moonlight some sat by the pool
some played bridge some played ping-
pong and brad and henrietta followed
several of those pursuits too but they
were never quite sure at the time which
one it was it never seemed to matter

  there were a good many highballs in-
volved and no little champagne an idea
of henriettas with which brad fell in
readily for though she was likely to float
nearly any time he found that when he
was slightly moistened with champagne
she floated in more wondrous ways than
ever

  they sat by the pool kiss me he
said because i cant breathe when you
dont or do

  she did have some more cham-
pagne she said
  they danced im tired she said
lets go sit on the porch they did
stopping on the way to fill their glasses

  you had better be careful my beau-
tiful beauty you better watch out i
cannot marry you rogue that i am but
rogue that i am i am likely to anyhow
if you dont watch out ah i wont but
wall-eyed codfish what tremendous re-
straint it requires not to take advantage
of you

  at a noise like ka-sloop he turned
his head to note a st bernard with one
neat curl of his tongue emptying his
glass

  hemingway is the only one that likes
champagne she said isnt that funny
come on well get some more

  maybe we ought to play bridge
brad suggested cautiously or talk to
your good parents or something may-
be he added tepidly

  on a night like this she said
look at that moon she leaned close
against him beside him her hand in his
as she stared up at the moon hanging
above the pool

  i know brad admitted heavily
bringing his own eyes up to it and cring-
ing slightly at the added romantic im-
pact it gave everything this was awful
it made everything so very difficult

  well go for a ride she said in a
roadster with the top down come on
ill drive she led him off to get some
more champagne

brad came downstairs peering around
corners it was barely daylight no
one else was about he sneaked around a
little and finding jason he worked his
mouth a time or so this way and that
to sort of free it up so he could talk
through it

  are you ready  he asked i think
wed better beat it if i hang around
here any longer ill give her old man
back the twenty grand or no telling
what

  ive packed for both of us sir jason
said

  they can get along without you all
right 

  yes indeed there are plenty of
other servants more than necessary

  all right bring the stuff down and
ill be sneaking the car out

  soon they were bowling along the high-
way back toward new york two days
ago brad thought he came along here
blithe and care-free now he went back
blind sick of everything anything

to brad she was like no other girl

  jason he said dolorously i am a
wastrel and a louse

  yes sir jason assured him you
certainly are

  you dont have to be so damned
hearty about it brad said after all
i could have been worse i could have
married her probably at least i didnt
marry her

  oh jason said but you did sir
  there was a mile of silence

  oh brad said then i did huh
more silence then so thats what i
was doing-how i happened to wake up
in her room

  presently he turned the car around
six-thirty on sunday morning was a
terrible time to be up anyhow and when
you added to that a fairish hangover and
the task that now lay before him you
had a mighty bitter combination brad
thought and the thought was reflected
in his face as he came into the break-
fast-room where henrietta had just
seated herself

  she smiled at him brightly hello
have some breakfast

  i guess not he muttered i mean-
look henrietta it seems that last night
i sort of inadvertently wasnt watching
myself and i sort of inadvertently took
advantage-well i sort of inadvertently
married you it seems and-
inadvertently hell she said pluck-
ing a grape from a bunch on her plate
do you realize how much champagne
i had to pour down you plus highballs
mr gladstone will chase me hen-
rietta said and brad threw her out
into the pool

before youd give in she popped the
grape into her mouth have you milked
yet 

  henrietta brad said you dont un-
derstand i mean well frankly you
see im just a rascal i go around mulct-
ing people i live by my wits i have no
honor no stability you see i am poi-
son look and he handed her her
fathers check i even fleeced your dear
old dad  thats the kind of rotter i am i
guess he added you can have it back
now it would be kind of ill-bred to keep
it now i guess but you can see what
im like underneath

  oh thats all right she said it
isnt any good im the only one that
can write good ones and not for very
much we decided on me she ex-
plained because i hate to write them
so and anyhow i never can find a pen

  do you mean brad said groggily
that that sweet kind old gentleman gave
me a phony check for my stock

  well if the stock was good she
pointed out reasonably he could sell it
and make the check good and of course
if it wasnt he didnt lose anything did
he

  but brad said waving one hand and
then the other but-why henrietta
that mounts to sharp practice why
thats no less than- he stopped un-
certainly but this place he said and
the way you live and-and-everything
you cant be-

  oh that she said you see a
brother of dads left him the place and
a lot of money too but i guess we just
werent used to money and nobody
thought to watch it very close and-well
you see but i guess its all right
weve still got the place even if it is
mortgaged some and i guess we can live
on it ail right cant we

  live on the place brad repeated
weakly but alph is losing on it who
would-how- he broke off staring at
her little crinkles coming around the
corners of his eyes

henrietta put a grape into her
mouth and then another well
she said you see-well you did say
you could make money on it you know-
and since were married and-and all-
her voice trailed off and she watched
him uncertainly absently tucking an-
other grape into her mouth he just sat
and stared at her through narrowed eyes

  it was-it was lucky wasnt it she
tried alph-id been trying to take
over-and then you-just at this time
it was sort of like-fate wasnt it a
winning smile appeared on her face brief-
ly nervously or maybe not she mur-
mured

  brad spoke then and it was in a low
grim monotone of all the sneaking
he said of all the underhanded dirty
low scheming-why he bellowed sud-
denly you just lured me into marrying
you so youd have somebody to run your
old farm of all the mean-you dont
love me-and here i was feeling sorry
guilty thinking i had-

  he rose suddenly and shoved his chair
back well if you think im going to
be patsy for a bunch of screwballs youve
got another think coming snookums if
you think ill run your old farm youre
nuts i dont like farms i hate farms
and furthermore you certainly have
played a hell of a snide trick on an inno-
cent trusting heart why he finished
chokingly you-you deceived me
and with this crushing indictment he
spun on his heel and stalked out the
door out onto the porch down the steps
and around to the roadster he got in
and bellowed for jason

  in a moment jason came carrying two
more suitcases

  i guess youll have to sit in the rum-
ble jason henrietta said

  yes madam jason answered re-
spectfully

  she got in beside brad

  get out of here he ordered grimly
you dont love me and you just mar-
ried me because-

  hush she said of course i love
you besides how do i know you can
farm all i have is your word for it
maybe you cant farm at all it didnt
hurt anything to try did it    well
lets go

  now brad had his eyes squinted up
again staring at her you mean he
said finally you mean youre sure
nough intending to go off with me now
not knowing where im headed or what
well be doingi or how well be living or
anything

  well for heavens sake brad she
said i married you didnt i whither
thou goest i shall go you know that
kind of stuff what did you expect
for a few moments he just sat there
it was kind of hard to get right away
this was his wife this strange marvel-
ous unpredictable kid was his wife

she wasnt unpredictable though or
strange once you caught on merely
marvelous she simply knew what she
wanted and she went straight ahead after
it and if it didnt cost anything fine
and if it did she was ready to pay it
sure put him on the rack though

  he sighed heavily and stared off across
the fields

  then he turned suddenly and leveled
a finger at her ill tell you one thing
he said theres going to be plenty of
changes made around here terell be
lots less servants and farmhands and a
couple of uncles learning to run tractors
and some work and less frivolity farm-
ing isnt something you can do in your
spare time see and if t- suddenly
he stopped and a look of agony crossed
his face oh lordy lordy he moaned
just think of it-all my life ahead of
megunning a farm and its so big and

-and jarmy damn it it just doesnt
seem fair

  you run along and milk henrietta
said soothingly and then youll feel bet-
ter

  me milk he said what about
you why dont-

  run along now she said im sick
of milking after all why do you think
i married you she kissed him lightly
on the tip of the nose

brad was looking at her again with
that uncertain squint but before he
spoke jason coughed

  i hope youll understand sir he said
if under the circumstances i should-
uh-resign soon a card-sharp of my ac-
quaintance has made me an attractive of-
fer and while he has by no means
your-

  jason brad wailed jason dont
you desert me here i am with a hang-
over jason and my whole world crum-
bling on my head marrying a lazy wife
and eleven hundred acres to farm and no
dough and two nutty uncles and four sis-
ters to marry off and i dont know what
all jason he implored piteously
leave me something from the wreckage
of my dreams dont you quit me 
jasons cherubic face became a field for
warring emotions it was pink as if with
great pressure behind it

  oh go on jason henrietta  said
be a sport hes a nice guy

  one must admit jason said he
makes a stirring plea

  look jason brad urged wildly
well think of something some oil
swindle-well salt the land-or well
raise horses-all kinds of low practice
is possible in horse-trading well be
unspeakable jason i promise

  well jason said reluctantly we
might try it sir you do make it sound
attractive

  brad relaxed ah he said well
thats some better he got out of the
car his hangover seemed not quite so
bad

  mrs carster he said firmly i ex-
pect you to see that my breakfast is wait-
ing for me when i come in a large field-
hands breakfast he added

  yes darling henrietta agreed con-
tentedly

  brad decided that his hangover was in
fact practically gone he straightened
up a little

  jason he said briskly my stool and
bucket its time to milk
cjhe invisible

he came in midsummer a port-
able godsend riding in a truck
his entracte music was the
tinny cacophony of cocoa-cans
strung up for bells comparedto his bay-
ing basso the fabulous voice of stentor
the herald was but an effeminate lisping
and when he climbed down from his cab
and stalked across my lawn he towered
over me his beard waving in the breeze

  old iron sir rags feathers lead
pipe and when i did not reply di-
rectly he added sotto voce coming near-
er  or practically any dam kind o thing
you cant use and want shet of



  so i told him about the beds in my
bushes   

  this fifty-acre farm of mine on mudge
mountain has been a mixed blessing these
many years since i inherited title large-
ly it has lain idle and running to under-
brush though some years i have rented
out grazing privileges i have scarcely
used the place save to come up for a week
or two in summer-time as much to es-
cape the heroic good intentions of sarah
snogget my housekeeper as to recapture
moments of my almost-forgotten youth

  a few years ago i leased the place to
an enterprising citizen who turned it into
certain strange events on a quiet new eng-
land farm give us this vivid story by the man
who wrote the mummy of phineas clough

wife

a dude ranch dudes came in droves but
the ranch was a financial failure and
the citizen broke his lease and vanished
without paying me for the use of my
property when next i summered up
here i discovered that the absconding
citizen ere he departed had disposed of
the iron bedsteads in which the dudes had
slept by the simple device of dumping
them into the gullies and underbrush
around my farmhouse

beds intruded everywhere my new
neighbors the young warrens com-
plained that when they picked wild rasp-

by

fulton grant

berries on my place the ripest and best
were sure to be hiding deep behind a
rusty bedspring enmeshed in the bush
a hired hand barked his shins and even
broke his ankle tripping over unseen iron
corners i cut my own fingers and peeled
my knuckles on hidden beds until in the
rather slangy words of zelda warren
those beds were getting into my hair
the junkman grinned at my account
say them dudes mustve done some
pretty fancy kind o sleepin tove busted
them beds sos they had to toss em out
by the by sir youre squire bray 

  i admitted my identity
illustrated by
austin briggs

  heard tell somewhat about you pll
over sunnyside county commented the
big man looks as how you got plenty
of popular votes last election-time my
names howard sir-jim howard but
jim aint short for james a-tall

  i dare say mild curiosity showed in my
expression for he gave me a partial ex-
planation

  jims from jimson-thats the loco
weed howsomever jim howards the
name right now im a junky how
much the iron pound you sell me them
beds for squire bray

i told him he could have them for the
taking but he did not approve of that
i dont beg from no man squire

  i insisted that the beds constituted a
menace for whose riddance i would glad-
ly have paid fair money anyhow

sorry farmer
lie said but ive
stripped my gears
ou your road and
ill need to tele-
phone a garage

  he seemed relieved stroking his full
beard he said slowly

  thats honest and fair squire folks
about here says youre a hard man but
square-and believe they got you right
well sir youll find jim howard pays his
debts want i should start in to de-bed
this place right away
  i did and said as much and the junk-
man thrust two fingers into his mouth and
whistled a magic note magic because at
its shrill abracadabra out popped three
fabulous little creatures from the truck-
none would have stood higher than my
waist all wore fantastic costumes which
seemed to have been cut out of cast-off
trousers sewn at the top and all were
dirty beyond human concept tt was
the rim of grime about their faces in
fact which gave the illusion of beards
on their chins-and hence that of elves
gnomes leprechauns or other little peo-
ple of myth and song

  down from the truck however the
little people proved to be entirely human
they galloped across my yard emitting
wild infantile cries of glee they clus-
tered about giant jim tugging at his
trousers and yelping at his shins like a
pack of happy terriers

  he roared at them in mock anger
hush yer din now ye muddy brats
and listen squire bray says theres a
ton of old iron in them bushes that he
will give us go and find it whilst i fetch
in the chariot

  and they scampered off with yells of
joy and whoops of childish excitement

  them explained jim howard is
the seven dwarfs-three of em that is
i never did complete the whole set
then he added as though in apology for
this whimsy dwarfs ellen she says
thats but a silly idea when they made
her snow white

  ellen my curiosity was less polite
than piquant then you have an older
daughter 

  i fancied a shadow crossed his face
my wife he said almost like a chal-
lenge then abruptly he turned away
and strode to his truck

i could not know of course that the
coming and going of jim howard
was to be but an interim in some divine
pattern which would weave them all ir-
revocably into my life-skein and me into
theirs i could not know that this chance
incident was but a prelude to tragedy
and so i thought no more of the jupkman
then other than to store him away in
my memory as an oddity which might
make for a bit of amusing conversation
when i next should meet my neighbors
the daniel warrens

  yet three days later it was that the
truck came rumbling into my drive again
followed by a miraculous trailer which
was followed by a despondent jersey

heifer to which was tied a goat-cart in
which rode the precious dwarfs

  squire announced jim howard we
are your debtors i sold them beds for
ten dollars the ton but i spent all the
money for the needs o livin if it suits
ye though well squat on your land
somewheres in a corner which ye dont
use and well work off our owin jim
howard always pays his debts

now there was a complex code you
may imagine my surprise

  i protested that he owed me nothing at
all i told him that i would be only a
fortnight up on my mountain farm and
that under the circumstances i had no
need of a man to help me work it i told
him moreover that i was no farmer at
all and that i planned some day to clean
up the place and sell it to the first fair
buyer

  i might better have saved my breath

  jim howard had come with the fixed
purpose of settling on my land and work-
ing for me short of rudeness i had no
words adequate to refuse him so the
howard tribe hauled their trailer cow
and baggage to my southwest hayfield
planted a miraculous garden and dug in
for an indefinite period

 the howard influence upon my
mode of living was prompt and positive
its effect was that i did not return to
bart corners until late fall and that i
became a practicing farmer like it or
not

  now i hand-dug ye a garden and
another for me all theyll need is the
plantin and i plowed ye ten acre o
land to grow alfalfa on i got a book
says theres profit in alfalfa the state
will pay for the inoculation besides
good tilth is straight from almighty
god sir bettern gold too tis a
wicked sin to let this place run wild al-
together

  when i tried mildly to protest that i
had no need nor intention of farming
the land he struck from another angle

  take this here porch squire them
uprights wont last the winter the sills
is rotted out theres a colony o ter-
mites which dont pay ye rent money too
give a year and it wont be safe you
talk o sellin you watch out or you
wont have no house to sell looks like
me an the dwarfs has a spot o carpen-
terin to fix things sos theyll stay put
awhile

  and so i was bullied and browbeaten
into rejuvenating my place i remained
therefore to supervise work which other-
wise i might have postponed for yet
another year and doubtless still another

  i saw little-of the howards beyond the
hours of actual work and i knew little
of how they lived in their trailer-home-
stead save that the gardens grew amaz-
ingly and produced enough for all of us
jim proved a fair carpenter and handy at
repairs the dwarfs helped him at his
work like tiny eager genii of a well-
rubbed lamp accomplishing between the
three of them the daily work of a grown
man there was smoke from the stove-
pipe of the home-made trailer and the
evening wind blew odors of good cooking
to whet my appetite and curiosity about
the squatters other than this however
i saw knew and learned little of them

  what puzzled me a little was the fact
that despite jims mention of his ellen i
saw no woman around the trailer and
none came to visit me--which was i
thought a little strange once i killed
two fat pullets and gave one to jim for
his dinner he thanked me courteously
enough but made no report as to how
his wife liked the chicken cooking was
done clothes washed and hung to dry
the children cared for and life lived in
the trailer-yet nary sign of a woman was
to be seen at the howards

my friendly neighbor and competent
gossip zelda warren came to call
one afternoon bringing samples of home-
made jams and a jug of new honey she
was a breathless likable vital young ty-
rant who usurped my kitchen chased me
to my veranda chair made tea in my own
kettle and played hostess to me in my
own house once weekly she chattered
at me like a bright magpie and gave me
gossip for gossip as was her habit

  and what she tossed at me as she
poured tea does the squire of bart
corners think of this trailer housewife
mrs howard

  i had to admit that i had never seen
the woman at all and mrs warren
demanded

  and are you so sure there is one
squire is a mrs howard i mean

  i mentioned the incident in which jim
howard spoke of his ellen she made a
droll face

  theres an old greek myth i remem-
ber about a fellow who wore a helmet of
invisibility do you suppose mrs how-
ard has such a gadget i saw she was
pulling my leg and i begged her to get
to the point of what was on her mind
she did at once and she was serious

  well squire the characters in this
mystery are a giant handy-man who
moves in on you and works for you in
spite of you he lives in a trailer on
your own land there are three brats he
calls his dwarfs-all doing mens chores
in defiance of the child-labor act now
the other day my curiosity about the
kind of a woman who would marry into
that kind of a life got the better of me
so i put on a clean frock and went over
to make a polite neighborly call on her
well 

  well they didnt exactly drive me
away from the trailer with guns but they
made it plain that i wasnt wanted there
and i couldnt even get a peek inside i
saw just enough though to convince my
feminine intuition that there isnt any
mrs howard at all-not a woman on the
place now what do you think of that
amos bray esquire

  i think i said teasing her a little
that you are a disappointed though
very charming young busybody zelda
warren

  she accepted my barb prettily and
flung me a smile

  toucm she said and busybody
if you like i confess theres nothing
that fascinates me more than a good
snoopy mystery when its about my neigh-
bors and there is a mystery in your
big ex-junkman and his strictly invisible
wife

  tosh i said

  daniel thinks so too

  now i have respect for warren-a writ-
er of plays and once an investigator i
knew him to be a man of considerable
insight into the ways of humans and so
for the first time i thought seriously of
the business


  just what i asked her does he
think

  he isnt sure but he feels he has seen
your jim howard before-and that he
wasnt a junkman

a day or so later a car of expensive
foreign make rolled into my drive-
way introducing the next element in
this drama

  jim howard and his dwarfs having
quit for the day i was alone that eve-
ning and so it was i who answered the
clatter of my front-door knocker

  the gentleman who stood there was a
comely fellow handsome in a faintly dis-
sipated way his shirt was open at the
neck his riding-breeches had never been
astride a horse his tweed jacket was a
trifle loud for good taste and yet he had
a distinguished air about him too what
struck me most was the mans smile
which was a good one albeit practiced
and artificial and his manner of being
accustomed to getting what he liked by
use of the smile he carried a wooden
box or kit slung over one shoulder on
a strap

  good evening farmer he said that
patronizing use of the word antagonized
me at once i hope ive not disturbed
you what i wanted was to ask permis-
sion to drive up to that hill of yours and
make some sketches

  he referred to the rise of ground half a
mile or so from my house which is the
high point of mudge mountain and
which i call the pinnacle now i care
not who rides swims fishes or walks on
my unused farmland so long as they have
the decency to ask me first and so i told
hint that he could for all i might object
risk life and limb by driving that pretty
machine over the treacherous rock road
to the pinnacle

  sketches i repeated youre an
artist sir

  his smile expanded a notch if possible
he shook his head

  thank you but no-not really an
artist only a dabbling amateur i fear
a would-be by profession im an actor
dunne is the name-cyril dunne it is
just possible that you may have-seen me
in something-that is if you ever get to
the theater in new york

  he held out a democratic hand for an
humble farmer to shake although he did
not ask my own name in return more-
over he played this little scene with just
the proper air of casual unconcern and
with no boasting or hint that for any

  american but the most illiterate it would
  be inconceivable not to have heard of
  cyril dunne but i am too old to be
  impressed by great names and so i let
  it go at that and told him to paint all he
  might please probably convincing him
  that i was but a mere clod who had
  never heard of the theater much less of
  a cyril dunne

    so off he went and it was just as his
  car lumbered away from my door that i
  saw the woman sitting in it

    a piquant beauty-a shade too hard
  perhaps but emphatic as a diamond her
  hair was dark not black but of deep
  chestnut her skin was strikingly white
  there was about the woman a vividness
  which left upon me an impression far
  deeper than that given me by her cava-
  lier cyril dunne for all his great name
  and histrionic smile

    the two it turned out did not remain
  long at the pinnacle i had eaten my
  supper and was enjoying my pipe when
  i heard the roar of a laboring motor
  presently it stopped and cyril dunne
  came to my kitchen steps

    sorry farmer he said using that
  damnable form of address again but i
  fear im a bad penny despite good inten-
  tions ive turned up this time because
  ive stripped my gears on your road and
  ill need to telephone a garage-if you
  will permit me

    i showed him the telephone-stand and
  he added reaching for it

    and ill gladly pay you for a bite to
  eat you see im not alone there is a
  lady with me in the car shes-ah-a
  bit fatigued and-

    his gesture was eloquent enough to
  produce the desired effect he used my
  phone to call breens garage in bart
  corners and i sat them down and gave
  them a solid if plain supper an old
  bachelor gets to be something of a cook

  but-fate dictated that zelda warren
  should visit me followed ten minutes
  later by her playwright husband daniel
  who burst in with his enthusiastic vitality
  oozing from every pore when zelda
  met the involuntary guests i fancied i
  caught a slight flush rising to her ears
  as she shook hands with cyril dunne
  and i thought also that even the broad-
  way hero exhibited a slight suggestion of
  having forgotten his carefully studied
  lines and then came warren following
  his wife after running an errand to town
  there was no doubt at all that he knew
  dunne they greeted each other a little
  
stiffly but each endeavoring to conceal a
hint of surprise and-was it animosity
i what of the lady  her name i
learned was mrs oliphant just that
without explanation or commentary she
was i gathered immediately an actress
though not celebrated dunne did not
explain her either and not even that
incorrigible gossip zelda warren chose to
pry into reasons why a mrs oliphant
should be wandering in the berkshires
with a theatrical star who had a flair for
oil paint

zelda did not like the woman that
was evident hardly more than a
girl mrs oliphant seemed and quite
as beautiful as i had thought her in my
first glimpse and yet there was an effort
at sophistication which did not compare
favorably at all with the naturalness of
mrs warren and the romantic enthu-
siasms of her husband she spoke sel-
dom however and yet there was almost
invariably a barb in what she said even
with her escort cyril dunne

   it was a time when the actor employed
that hideous form of address to me call-
ing me farmer that she cut in

  but squire bray is no farmer-are
you squire  i can see that easily enough
youre just an escapist like the rest of
us real farmers are the only people
left who arent trying to get away from
something-themselves most of all they
dont play golf and sit all night in stuffy
night-clubs and spend their daytime liv-
ing in abeyance until they can finish their
job and escape from it theyre the only
people who seem to have any fun just
living youre escaping from something
too arent you squire bray

   i squirmed at that for it was no less
than the truth-albeit an intrusion on the
part of a woman whom i had never seen
before and might i began to hope then
never see again it had not occurred to
me that i was escaping anything beyond
the domineering of good mrs snogget
my housekeeper and i writhed under
the poignancy of this womans probing

   devil take the girl  i thought who
is she to meddle in the lives of strangers
or dissect them publicly

   but i let it pass

  now mrs warren as i intimated did
not seem favorably impressed by the oli-
phant woman still zelda is a compe-
tent soul and shielding her dislike smart-
ly she became solicitous for mrs oli-
phant even dragging the woman upstairs
to my guest-rooms for a feminine chat

  and a nose-powdering it was while they
were up there that the evening had its cli-
 max

    i had produced a bottle of good hard
  cider and had opened a box of what i call
  my political cigars and was passing
  them to the two men when my kitchen
  door burst open and i saw jim howards
  huge body loom in the doorway his red
  beard flaming in the lamplight

    squire he boomed out its the
  one i call grumpy-hes sick with fever
  i wonder could i-

    he stopped there his mouth agape and
  i saw that he had noticed my guest his
  eyes were focused on cyril dunne with an
  expression in them which it seemed
  strangely to me combined fear and re-
  sentment and perhaps primitive hate

    not understanding but knowing that
  jim howard was an odd sort anyhow i
  excused myself before the pause was
  obvious and led the man back to the
  kitchen

    ill phone dr bradley i told him
  why didnt you let me know earlier
  ive aspirin here and quinine take
  them back and try to get his temperature
  down without waiting for the doctor
  have you a thermometer

    he scarcely listened his eyes had not
  left the door to my sitting-room his
  voice somehow was changed-quieter
  lacking in that rich countrymans coarse-
  ness and colloquialism as he demanded
  who is that man in there

    i brushed away this irrelevance

   a man called dunne  now youd
 better try the quinine if the temperature
 is very high if its not down in half an
 hour put the boy in a cold tub and
 you can bring him over here to sleep in a
 real bed if he can be moved jim that
 trailers no place for sick people bring
 mrs howard too if you like shell want
 to stay by him im sure

    i got no reply at all to that he was
  backing out of the door holding the
  medicine and the thermometer in his
  hands and i saw that he was too over-
  wrought to talk

 when he had gone i rejoined the
 others explaining about my mans
 sick boy actor dunne was superficially
 if politely sympathetic daniel warren
 was genuinely concerned when the ladies
 came downstairs and zelda warren
 learned of the trouble she behaved as a
 generous friendly woman would she
 hurried out and went over to the trailer
 to help nurse the child


  and dont you dare to think she
whispered to me at the door that its
just my curiosity about the invisible mrs
howard either i

  breens garage telephoned that due to
trouble with their wrecking-car they
could not come for dunnes machine that
night-which created a somewhat un-
conventional situation i own no car
neither do the warrens moreover
there is no hotel or rooming-house within
fifteen miles where they might spend the
night so i extended an invitation to
them to spend the night under my roof

  mrs oliphant could not refrain from
some sidelong dart in which she termed
me a proper chaperon dunne was
grateful but a shade too profuse in his
thanks dan warren shook hands and
withdrew taking me by the arm to the
door he paused on the step and asked
me oddly

  by the way squire do you know who
it is youre keeping for the night
you mean cyril dunne the actor
surely-

  i mean he said cyril dunne the
devils avant-garde

  then he left

i seemed fated to get little sleep that
night

  mrs oliphant used the big colonial
bedroom which i have kept intact with
the original furnishings of ezekiel bray
my great-great-grandfather who built
the place in the s dunne was made
comfortable in a room down the upper
hallway near my own i had turned out
the lights and was ready to go to bed
myself when dr bradleys car drove up
returning to town

  that boys all right he informed
me not so much thanks to your quinine
as in spite of it-pretty rough medicine
for a young chap his age however it
was only a touch of influenza and hell
do now mrs warren seems a handy
nurse by the way what i came to tell
you is more about the father if i read
the signs right hes the sick one-men-
tally i mean

  jim howards an odd character but
his minds all right i said -
possibly it is now but it wont be if
he keeps on brooding also youd better
take those people out of that trailer
wagon amos theyll die of it why
dont you give them the house when you
go back to bart corners seems a lik-
able enough fellow this howard but
hell break down living there needs a

he was talking to that portrait as
though she were really there

woman id say and a comfortable
home-for the youngsters anyhow and
he needs company psychiatrys not
much in my line amos but ill gamble
that fellows got troubles tucked away
behind his beard somewhere make a
good man to have around your place
too ever see the library he carries
about 

  i told him id never been in the trailer

  greek books-latin books-lots of
fine classics quite a french library too
-mostly moliere racine and hugos
plays never knew you had an intellec-
tual hired man out here bit of a rarity
isnt it

  he departed before i could express my
own amazement

  again i was starting for bed when
my telephone rang i tiptoed past mrs
oliphants room and heard cyril dunne
snoring lustily in his room-which gave
me to speculate on whether his admiring
broadway audiences were acquainted
with his nocturnal histrionics-and i
went downstairs again

  it was zelda warren on the telephone

  i need to talk to you squire bray
she said dan is all against it but hes
gone to bed now and cant protest will
you step out and meet me at the end of
our road  it might be rather important

  so i wrapped myself in an overcoat
and slipped out prepared for any con-
tingency and thinking that the sick boy
the blue book magazine

might have had a relapse i was not
prepared however for what mrs warren
had to say out there in the dark  

 i saw the invisible mrs howard
squire were her first words and i felt a
twinge of resentment at being kept from
my bed to hear any such idle gossip per-
haps i was just a trifle testy in my tone
as t replied

 interesting now perhaps in the
morning if you-

  please squire she broke in on me
and i saw she was quite upset i didnt
bring you out here just to say that im

laundry and cooking its pathetic it
makes my heart ache and then that
portrait hanging there like the household
goddess the lares et penates-and the big
man sitting there by the sick boys cot
staringt it and muttering-you could
almost say praying to it 

  come now he-

  he was talking to her just as though
she were really there hes a sick man
this jim howard dr bradley noticed it
too somethings on his mind-some-
thing sudden and new-as though it had
just happened tonight tell me did he

 trying to tell you that there really isnt
 any mrs howard shes only a portrait
 hanging in his trailer

 a painting

 of the mrs oliphant who is at your
 house and its signed by cyril dunne
 i stared at her

 eh hows that

 she nodded slowly and the implication
 of it all came to me with a rush

 good god i said

 that trailer is full of tragedy squire
 reeks of it you cant imagine the at-
 mosphere-those three kids the dwarfs
 as he calls them doing all the house-
 work almost and jim howard doing the

see mrs oliphant when he came to your
house 

  i said no and remarked that mrs
oliphant had been upstairs with her at
the time adding

  but you dont mean that this mrs
oliphant is really mrs howard-that she
may have left him for-dunne

  i dont mean anything definitely
but it could be that    you dont know
cyril dunne hes a devil a satyr a-



she could not move away
even ir she would he took
her gently by i he shoulder
pulling her close to him
the invisible wife

hes not a nice person squire he leaves
a trail of women behind him like fallen
petals daniel knows him-and hates
him i had an experience with him
once-well never mind that and then
this mrs oliphant is-well shes a
witch-without a broomstick i know
her type only too well shed fall for
cyril never fear

  never mind that i said meaning to
be chivalrous on the face of it she
couldnt be mrs howard-ihe mother
of three children one of them ten years
old shes barely twenty-five

  i know but shes something to him
or she wouldnt hang on his trailer wall
would she painted by cyril dunne
and how would a man of dunnes
world have contact with the wife of a
man of jim howards world  obviously

mrs oliphant is a woman of culture
whether you like her or not even if jim
howard reads greek and latin and the
french dramatists like lincoln reading
law by candlelight-

  we dont know anything about this
jim howard squire dan is sure hes
seen him some place and he has the same
feeling about mrs oliphant i think i
have too-maybe with the angora cats at
a fair with long white whiskers

  cat yourself i said with feeble
good humor she seems nice enough to
me-a little hard but all right

  well ill not argue im trying to
tell you that i have an intimation of
tragedy i wish they werent anywhere
in the neighborhood dont let jim
howard see her squire get them out of
your house before he comes over in the


the blue book magazine

morning do something-get them away
before-

  before what

  im sure i cant imagine but-some-
thing unpleasant i like jim howard
i cant stand to see him hurt if you had
seen him mumbling at that portrait-

  very well i promised her remem-
bering jims odd behavior at the sight of
dunne ill do what i can now you
go back home and to bed

  and i walked with her to her door

i could not as it happened get dunne
and mrs oliphant out of my house in
the early morning nor could i prevent
the inevitable from taking place

  dunne was up at daybreak his sketch-
box and easel under his arm striding off
to make a sketch from the pinnacle of
mudge mountain where he had driven
last night there was no way that i
could decently stop him there had
moreover been no sign from the colonial
bedroom and i knew that mrs oliphant
must be sleeping late i could not ob-
viously go in and wake her i did make
an effort to get charles breen on the
telephone at seven oclock and urge him
to send a mechanic up as early as possi-
ble but that effort was futile as it later
proved

  there was nothing unnatural in the
fact that jim howard was not busy with
his chores at six in the morning for i
knew he must have had a tiresome vigil
over the sick boy and t remembered the
odd comment of dr bradley in speaking
of jim the night before and so the
morning passed until nearly ten oclock
-when the explosion came

  there were loud voices in my back-
yard through the kitchen door i saw
the two men dunne and jim howard
the one tall and graceful in his costly
tweeds the other taller heavier and in
disarray towering over the actor in a
stance that plainly betrayed anger im-
pulsively i stepped out and went toward
them but i had hardly passed the
pumphouse when i saw i was too late
jim howards fist flailed like a medieval
mace-and struck dunne in the face

 dunne was down i shouted they
did not heed me the actor was on his
feet in an instant and a fight was on

  one would scarcely expect to discover
a skilled boxer in a man like cyril dunne
and yet he turned out to be one jim
howard was something of a hercules in
brute force and his shaggy appearance
suggested that the fury of a wild animal

might lurk in him and yet as i stood
there impotent and frightened it was
evident that dunne was the master not
my burly junkman

  he was theatrical naturally he put a
sardonic smile on his lips as he sent a
swift left to the big mans head bouncing
nimbly back out of reach of those terrible
paws before jim could set himself

  you always were a lout and a fool
oliphant i heard dunne snarl youve
asked for this and by god youll get it
then he hurled himself at the bigger
man in a flurry of blows that literally cut
jims face to pieces

  oliphant-oliphant  in my confused
brain the connection was not clear at
once and presently the excitement of the
fight itself drove away all chance of
association

  dunne proved not only skillful but
strong enough too jims face and head
was taking severe punishment but he
seemed making no effort to avoid the
blows save to give slightly backward
now and then when dunnes fist threat-
ened to blind his eyes only once did he
lash out with his fist catching dunne full
on the mouth and sending him sprawling
on his back in the mud but the actor
was up again and once more the one-
sided show went on

  suddenly jim howard took one step
forward his hands opened and reached
clawlike blows rained on his face but
he shrugged them away then his reach-
ing hand caught dunnes arm and closed
on it there the tide turned

slowly inexorably howard bent the
actors arm his other hand found
a shoulder and t could see the huge mus-
cles ripple along the gripping arm in
another instant the big man had closed in
and had his great weight on the actor
pressing him down they fell together
howard on top

  i cried out then howards hands were
on dunnes throat and the actors head
was yielding under their pressure

  dont t yelled for gods sake
dont do it jim i was terrified at the
sight of murder being committed before
my eyes

  a strange grin-not a pleasant thing to
see-came on jim howards bearded face
then and i heard him mutter as though
to himself

  junky jim howard-he always pays
his debts

  then dunnes head snapped back and
i thought the end had come
the invisible wife

  there was a soft swishing beside me
and a gentle voice spoke one brief word
jim  said the voice jim i

  the big mans hands relaxed their hold
he lifted his head and stared at mrs
oliphant as moses may have lifted his
eyes to god in the burning bush

  dont jim she said it isnt what
you think

  and then the strangest bit of this his-
tory took place

  jim howard got up from the prostrate
body of dunne his great length un-
folded and he stood straight an immense
man he took a step toward mrs oli-
phant and held her eyes with his it
seemed as though she could not move
away from him even if she would he
reached out with a huge bloodied hand
and took her gently by the shoulder pull-
ing her close to him and then without a
word he compelled her away shielding
her with his great arm his mighty
strength leading her down the little patch
which led to the trailer

the warrens had asked me to dinner
and now over the coffee daniel was
talking

  not he was saying that im one to
go about sniffing other peoples troubles
   zelda handles that department for
the family

  she flung him a playful scowl

  men she said make me sick if
they have curiosity they call it being
humanely interested in fellow creatures
but when a woman has it they call it
snooping

  i	halted this by-play

 come now daniel was telling us
about jim howard and mrs oliphant
do you really mean he wasnt what he
pretended to be at all but an actor
a rather good character actor in
fact but never likely to get famous
probably thats partly why she left him
but of course the-

  you mean mrs oliphant was mrs-
oliphant jim howard is jimson oli-
phant of the toppeq players company-
or was up to a year or so ago i had a
feeling all along that i had seen him
somewhere the beard was a gooddis-
guise in this case he did well in the
hired-man scene in the farmer in the
dell remember zelda i dare say he
got his colloquial chatter and lines out of
that part and when he quit the theater
and changed his skin so to speak it all
came in handy to make him into a jim
howard the junkman

  and the beard zelda put in

  zeldas husband ignored her as to
ellen oliphant she used to be ellen
bower-a stage-struck youngster who did
bits and nothing more she did the
housemaid in that play too thats
where oliphant met her they were
married when it closed being years
older than she it all made broadway
gossip the girl was smart but not very
sweet i thought-

  smart and cheap -from zelda
she didnt give up the stage when
they married she had a small part in
my play other mens wives i remem-
ber dunne played the lead in it you
know hes rather a hand at conquering
ingenues-has a reputation for it to say
the least

  the very least commented zelda
i fancy he painted her portrait-he
has used that gag before to my knowl-
edge anyhow the play closed with
scandal in the air and pretty soon ellen
left oliphant and was seen with dunne
although i dont believe she ran off with
dunne in the vulgar meaning of that
term at least she was still doing small
parts last winter

  and howard i asked

  he took it all very badly he was an
odd number anyhow had been married
once before but his wife died and i
suppose he was caught by ellen on what
is commonly called the bounce he
wanted home and children and solidarity
he even adopted three orphan brats out
of an asylum

  the dwarfs

daniel nodded that was partly
why ellen quit him so its said
not to mention the blandishments of
dear cyril 

  i was trying not to mention them
what im getting at is that oliphant quit
the stage right after she left him but
from what i hear oliphant has always
known that he was limited as an actor
he had a yearning for farm-life and the
land

  so he took the dwarfs with him and
went in for it

  i dont know much about that but it
seems to fit

  well what about them now dunne
got patched up and went back yesterday
but he went alone do you think mrs
oliphant will stay with her husband  i
asked

  she just might at that shell never
be an actress and i think she knows it
the invisible wife

if i were writing them into a play id
have her stay with him and complete the
set of dwarfs

  then your play would be a flop the
leopard-nor any other feline creature-
cant change her spots things like that
dont really happen in life

  daniel warren had been staring out of
the window as he talked and now he
gestured in the direction of my house
as he said 

  well somethings about to happen in
life right now my dear wife and severest
critic i can see them coming across the
fields right now both of them and from
the way theyre walking together theyve
got a purpose suppose we send the
squire home now to find out what their
purpose is the role of sexagenarian
cupid suits him pretty well

  and so i got to my own side door as
jim the junkman was in the act of knock-
ing on it

  he had changed overnight he had
trimmed off half his beard and whipped
it into dignity he had on clothes whose
cut was not new but tyhich had been
scarcely worn also he had his big arm
on the shoulder of that pale young wom-
an into whose eyes i saw a new light had
dawned a new sweetness and jim spoke
to me without any trace of his country-
mans accent in his voice

  there is an apology due you squire
for the scene i put on here yesterday i
am really sorry-even although i am a
much happier man by it today

  while i dismissed his apology with a
wave of the hand ellen oliphant re-
minded him softly

  that wasnt all you came to say jim
no he said as much to me as to her
i came to apply for a job

  a job

  a family job-for all of us-ellen the
dwarfs and me id like to have the job
of caretaker on this farm for the winter
sir at no salary-it isnt the money sir
and if you will allow me a percentage i
think i could scrape some profit out of
the place-now since you arent going to
sell

  the job i said is yours but i can
afford a moderate salary

  he grinned queerly and relapsed into
his role of junky jim howard using the
characteristic lingo as he replied
thank ye kindly squire but theres
a debt to pay and jim howard always
pays his owins sir-seems as though

hello mate

 this stuff is sort oj out oj my line-ivriting
 letters i mean but for the last several years
 ive enjoyed your book so much that ive just
 got to hand you one oj those verbal bouquets

 almost all the lads in our squadron read this
 book and that proves it is a good book ij
 anyone could get these guys to sit and read a
 story-theyve performed a miracle

personally i am glad that your book doesnt
overdo the love angles in the stories i real-
ize they are necessary and i like them moder-
ate-thanks for not letting them get slushy

i dont believe it would hurt to have a few
pages set aside to give brief biographies of thei
authors and artists who write and draw for
you yep i sure enjoy the pictures too

the best story in my opinion was a mil-
lion jor john j destiny i like the jungle
stories too slightly better than the other types

well now that ive had my little say ill
obligingly jold up good luck and put in a
good word jor ii bedford-ones

as a woman reader oj blue book oh yes
there are quite a jew oj us i want to protest
against your heroines

your fictional heroes are grand-women still
like adventurous men but the women dont
have any reality at all they are apparently
just throwti in like a sack of candy as a- reward
to the hero for being such a nice brave fellow

are your authors afraid of women-or worn-
en-haters do they say to themselves well
i suppose pu have to put a woman in this
story-and gosh how i dread it

i wish to protest a change of blue book
format as suggested by h b i of warren
pa the logic of his argument relating to
news-stand- sales cannot be denied however

 i	suspect that the large format and slick paper
 of high class magazines serve advertising
 purposes rather than reader interests i find a
 large size unwieldy and the glare of shiny
 paper is especially utulesirable please dont
 solve news-stand display problems at the ex-
 pense of your regular readers i am not con-
 cerned with details such as length of stories
 etc all i want is that each paragraph be
 interesting and entertaining

  have been a constant reader of blue from
way-back days when one of the regular fea-
tures was written by that clever late-lamented
clarence herbert new-the diplomatic free
lances would that you could revive such
another series for these similarly stirring times
-and couldnt ii bedjord-jones do the job
yes i would like two or three novelettes per
issue do i vole jor the complete novel in
the slanguage of one of my grandsons too
right i do my preference in themeszjjword
and buckler historical romances secret
service stories western action i abominate
sex and problem stories-and compliment the
blue on its clean and healthy tone all the way
through its generous allowance of pages-and
also on its clear type and well-printed turnout

   i like talcs of us a business enterprises
pioneering of the states the revolution pe-
riod red indian adventures sabotage atid

anli-fiflh column activities political plots
and intrigues and anti-gangster stories to
these ends i keenly enjoy the contributions of
gordon keyne robert r mill james francis

  you have a gifted atelier of illustrators and
artists that september cover by always-
acceptable herbert morton stoops is a corker
you have corraled an unusual pen-pencil-and-

an only criticism

  magazines come and go sotne undergoing
much face-lifting during their brief period
of existence in an effort to retain the public
taste a few however are so well-fashioned
in the beginning as to render changes unneces-
sary blue book together unlit one or two oth-
er periodicals has succeeded in keeping up with
the times without losing its original identity

  sometime ago i wondered why with the re-
cent trend to picture magazines and digests
blue book was able to survive and put it down
to the fact that it has something not to be
found in any other magazine-a complete di-
gest of superior-type fiction

  a glance at any news-stand will show the
vast amount of pulp magazines for sale each
of which appears to specialize-in action love
adventure the weird and fantastic or western
none however combines all these ingredients
into one complete whole so effectively as does
blue book and therein lies the secret of its
continued popularity

  in a world upset by war and treachery we
cannot have loo many stories throwing light-
on the dangers of he european situation and
its possible consequences to america so keep
on with your tales of nazi domination and all
it portends give its too the refreshing and
satisfying book-lenglh novels which are a
regular feature an only criticism would be in
the inclusion of loo many stories dealing with
the early centuries of foreign lands america
itself is so rich in tradition and adventure that
blue book could confine its contents to our
own shores and never run out of material

deafened and dazed by a
bombardment that had continued almost
without breaks for some one hundred
hours the survivors of the fifth for-
eign legion company stared at him with
astonishment they were about thirty
all that was left of the two hundred who
had landed at cape helles four days be-
fore they were genuine legionnaires
tough professional soldiers of the pre-
war north african species ordinary
journeymen of strife most of them had
worn out hobnails in morocco and ton-
kin  a few dated back to dahomey and
madagascar they had seen all kinds
of officers come into their corps and
knew at once that this one was a phe-
nomenon

  he stood very erect staring down the
tumbled length of the trench in fact it
was simply a deep ditch hastily dug in
the crumbling soil almost at random
three to six feet in width a chaos of sand-
bags

  it almost vanished in spots where the
big shells from the turks coast defense

batteries firing across the dardanelles
from the asiatic side had dropped
there had been little time to arrange
ordinary sanitation and on the level
ground above the dead had been piled
like cordwood to give the living fighting-
room the broiling heat of the eastern
sun brought up the smells

  is this the fifth company legion
yes lieutenant several men assured
him

  whos in charge here

  i am i guess lieutenant

  corporal eyckman rose and saluted
he was the ranking survivor hence act-
ing as captain he was a tall bony alsa-
tian nearing forty with a hawks face
above drooping sandy mustaches his
record was on his chest for all to see an
array of multicolored ribbons

  a corporal  im beginning to under-
stand all this- the officer indicated
the trench im lieutenant mareuil to
command this company

  eyckman wanted to explain that in
that case the lieutenant could command
the battalion as well all the officers had
been knocked out on the way up the
hundred odd men remaining being led by

an adjudant a senior sergeant and that
the turks having killed nine hundred
or so out of one thousand were evident-
ly bent on wiping out what was left-
that they had attacked five times in the
past two hours he had no time

 attention mareuil barked

   pulled erect by discipline the men rose
wearily many of them leaning against
the sides of the trench it was true that
they were legionnaires but days with-
out sleep without hot food almost with-
out water had affected them their
hands were raw from handling hot rifles
dust had caked thickly on their sweat-
ing faces so that when they blinked the
clean lids made a pinkish flutter against
the earthy masks many of them were
wounded and showed bloody bandages on
head or arms

their new chief stared at them and
they in turn looked at him in his
natty tailored khaki in his shiny leather
puttees with a brand-new kepi on his
skull he seemed like an apparition from
another world in fact he had come
from another world the beach where the
allied troops were landing all the way
up to them through atchi baba nulla
and the communication-trenches -
im from the colonial infantry he
announced brusquely

  they knew that from his collar tabs
they also knew that he was a veteran
from the medals he wore he was a big
handsome man with a tanned hard face
small regular features and a clipped
black mustache

a short novelette of the old foreign legion
and its share in the savage dardanelles
campaign during the first world war

by georges
surdez

  im from the colonial infantry he
repeated i have commanded senega-
lese malgasy and tonkinese but
youre the seediest outfit that ever fell
to my lot his jaws snapped atten-
tion-stand away from the sides the
first thing to do is to clean out this sty
we may not stay here long but i want
this clean while we are here

  we have had no time to- eyckman
protested

  the turks annoyed you eh what
did you expect them to do  i want these
bays cleared of all dirt at once every-
one except the sentries actually needed
fall to

  the men grumbled under their breath
but started to work with their trenching
tools they had no better equipment
for the keynote of everything in this
dardanelles venture seemed to be mud-
dling improvisation

  lieutenant- the corporal began

  youre not exempt get to work

  eyckman obeyed and as he had ex-
pected the moment dirt started to fly
over the parapet the activity invited the
enemys attention a furious fusillade
broke out from the turkish trench  mau-
sers cracked endlessly the air above the
trench was alive with deadly metal the
sentries opened fire the others dropped
their tools and ran for the loopholes

  mareuil caught the nearest man as he
passed flung him back his voice cut
through the din keep working keep
working im in command here and
give the orders have you forgotten what
an officer looks like

  the soldiers picked up their tools
they eyed the new arrival with hatred
what was wrong with him  why did he
want to call attention to their particu-
lar sector before long the field-bat-
teries of the turks would start pouring
shells on their position to halt suspi-
cious movements

  mareuil went to a loophole between
two sand-bags peered awhile evident-
ly what he saw did not satisfy him for
he rested both hands on the upper sand-
bags hoisted himself up and he re-
mained there for some time kepi cocked


on his right ear with the bullets flying
about him the turks were not more
than three hundred yards away what-
ever his faults the new man was not timid

  the first seventy-seven shell fell very
near followed by a second a third
mareuil casually slid to the floor of the
trench dusting his tunic on which dirt
had spattered

  lots of stiffs up there he told the
corporal

  sure we tried to get over last night
and all day long theyve been trying to
get here hard guys to lick-

  theyre self-respecting soldiers thats
all mareuil declared a few more
bags over here    thats the idea
deepen this traverse-you and you-get
going

  his long legs took him along the trench
swiftly he was everywhere from time
to time he would halt by eyckmans side
and ask him questions jotting the answers
down in his notebook whos on our
right zouaves good on our left
right naturally you havent a plan of
the sector ready all right didnt ex-
pect you to

  theyre coming a sentry called

  the legionnaires scarcely halting in
their tasks looked at the lieutenant
damn him they could play that game
too and show him they waited for orders
he half-smiled allowed fifteen seconds
to pass then snapped drop tools
everyone to the loopholes he caught
at eyckmans sleeve have you a rifle
for me

  there were rifles by the dozen from
colonial habit the legionnaires recov-
ered all rifles and ammunition although
in this show the enemy was unlikely to
pick up the stuff the legionnaires
opened fire slowly with method they
had been taught not to waste cartridges

  like them mareuil peered into the
twilight and emptied his magazine

the enemy poured into sight like
swarming insects as the distance
was short they broke into a run at
once the comforting tack-tack of ma-
chine-guns came from the right where a
zouave section of gunners was en-
trenched the rifle-bullets the bursts
from the guns split the advancing line
of turks into separate fragments that
flowed together again dislocated frit-
tered in a spray of crouching running
figures which dwindled rapidly

  eaqh legionnaire had several loaded
rifles propped ready for use as soon as

  one grew too hot to handle he picked up
another it was almost impossible for
an experienced man to miss at the range
the turks fell in tens in fifties mowed
down by the horizontal sheets of invis-
ible metal sprayed on them but they
kept pouring out big chaps in gray in
new companies fresh battalions surging
out of the dark earth into the twilight
glow speeding toward death

  through the uproar cut the sound of
human voices the encouraging cries of
the officers the clamor of the charging
fanatic troopers allah-allah-allah
then seventy-five batteries started to
bark furiously the ground was bloom-
ing with explosions but for some sec-
onds it seemed that nothing could stop
those turks mareuils voice was heard
at the signal fix bayonets and get up
there to meet them

and they saw him those who had time
 to glance in his direction place a
whistle between his teeth his face was
set tense but showed a certain grim
calm there was courage in the fellow
and intense pride of leadership isolat-
ed turks were being dropped in the
barbed wire when unexpectedly the hu-
man wave receded curled back rapidly
dipped into the soil again for thirty
seconds longer the shells plopped on the
neutral stretch churning earth dead and
dying men

  cease firing mareuil called

  the men leaned against the side of the
trench breathing hard then all reached
for their canteens the lieutenants
voice shook them sentries keep your
posts others back to work

  the legionnaires were reaching the
limits of human endurance everything
was losing reality they moved fought
and worked like somnambulists cor-
poral eyckman whose lean body was
hardened by eighteen years of soldiering
nevertheless could not control a grunt of
protest

  whats that corporal 

  were worn out lieutenant no
sleep for-

  what do you expect me to do  kiss
you mareuil shrugged youre sol-
diers and youre doing your job he
grinned amusedly come on legion
night had fallen completely yet he
kept them working groping about wid-
ening the trench here mending a breach
there the solid discipline of the legion
was cracking it had been hard enough
to fight to see ones comrades killed off


one after the other but to be driven like
coolies between attacks was too much
hes got it in for us a man mumbled
he wont last long at this rate the
next one added

  yet when his wide silhouette loomed
out of the darkness near by they were
silent plied pick or shovel grimly at
last he called halt too dark to work
but as they started to disperse to seek
some spot where they could stretch out
to sleep he added corporal-the roll
eyckman called out the names then
reported twenty-seven privates one
corporal lieutenant

  i counted thirty men when i arrived
corporal

  yes lieutenant but since two have
been killed

  i know i simply wanted you to re-
port correctly

  a murmur cameout of the night the
others had heard perhaps mareuil had
intended them to hear two men were
dead who had been alive when he had
arrived and all they meant to him was
itemization in the report

  you swine  a man shouted

  if the man who said that will come
out where i can see him mareuil re-
torted ill be glad to make it a personal
matter he waited a few seconds and
the pounding of the british cannon south
of krithia shook the night you are
tired you are uncomfortable you are
getting killed that is your lot as sol-
diers i dont go in for hysterical self-
pity

  you just got here

  this isnt the only place where there
is war the french front is hard at times
as well mareuil stood in the entrance
to a traverse addressing the men in the
long bay as long as we are in the lines
a man is no more than a piece of mate-
rial i would act and talk differently at a
funeral parade but for myself- he
started shouting if i get croaked use
me as a sand-bag-i dont ask for tears 
to the guy who insulted me when
unseen youre a triple-swine dismiss
for some time he strode up and down
the length of trenches held by his com-
pany by his company of twentyhght
men twice explosions dusted him with
fine dirt the concussion of a third made
him crouch then he squatted between
two sand-bags and appeared to go to
sleep and perhaps he did sleep in that
catastrophic turmoil

  hes crazy one legionnaire said to
the man nearest him

his inspection was thorough    he drib-
bled punishments as lie paced down the line

   maybe or hes getting the jump on
 us hes a slob but he has guts

    lie wont live long the first resumed
 darkly

   none of us will

   there were no dugouts no holes to
 creep into the men huddled at the bot-
 tom of the trench knees to chin and
 napped around them for a circle of
 miles the formidable concert continued
 coast-defense cannon slung exploding
 missiles into the camp around seddul
 bahr the warships sped armor-piercing
 projectiles against earthworks the field
 artillery was active on both sides from
 the northwest at intervals thudded the
 characteristic reports of four-point-sev-
 ens as a british destroyer shelled the
 turkish reinforcements marching to the
 lines near by at every bullet-impact
 there was a prolonged tenuous vibration
 the disturbed flies rising in clouds
 alerte aux armesl

   the turks were attacking again as
 the men stumbled to the parapet red
 rockets streaked the sky a curtain of
 steel dropped behind the french trench
if thats the way you feel take it this way

to cut off retreat while the retaliation
barrage stormed over the turkish posi-
tions the enemy ran up through the
explosions

  fix bayonets at them

  mareuil was first over the top the
legionnaires scrambled out behind him
fired standing like hunters potting rab-
bits then the anatolian infantrymen
closed in bayonets leveled the lieu-
tenants revolver spat twice three times
then he clubbed with the barrel at a man
who clutched him about the waist after
missing a lunge another turk a tall
fellow reversed his mauser started to
swing but a legionnaire leaped forward
kicked him in the groin drove a bayonet
through his throat as he bent over with
the pain

  theyre scramming-

  the brief hand-to-hand combat was al-
ready over the enemy had no way of
knowing how close he was to success
how few men really opposed him thirty
seconds later all were panting inside the
trench all but those fallen

  two dead one wounded one missing
lieutenant eyckman reported

  thank you corporal legionnaire
rammon 

  present lieutenant

  it -was you who saved my hide up
there mareuil demanded

  yes lieutenant it was i also who
called you a swine

  ah you have changed your mind
since then

  no lieutenant i helped the offi-
cer-there was a pause then the rest
came clearly deliberately not the
swine

  the officer thanks you rammon
there was a chuckle from mareuil as
for the swine you can kiss its foot

  the legionnaires laughed rammon
with them for the moment animosity
was forgotten they were about to dis-
perse when mareuil called them back
six guys out with tools theres a cave-
in over there six others to place new
wire

  lieutenant we-

  an order cannot be protested until
executed get going

  to do him justice mareuil took the
riskier job went out with the wire-mend-
ing gang naturally as this entailed
some noise the turks turned loose with
their mausers and before long one of
their machine-guns started its regular
rhythmic tack-tack closer and closer

  down   mareuil ordered suddenly
they crouched against the soil and the
machine-gun swept lead above them
some of it clacking and humming against
the metal strands up get to work
the legionnaires obeyed

  one fact was sure mareuil knew his
job his months of active service on the
western front counted colonial infan-
tryman or not he was as cool as brave
as a legion officer they were realizing
that he had not issued one useless order
had shared their dangers in those mo-
ments they came close to liking him

  the legion battalion was taken out
of the line next day

  at the camp in vermesh fountain ra-
vine it was reorganized with reinforce-
ments just landed a legion captain
took command of the outfit most of the
formation received officers from the
corps real legionnaires but mareuil
at his own request was maintained at
the head of the fifth company

  what was left of the old gang those
who had seen him in action were willing
to forgive and forget their first reports
to the new arrivals were favorable but
the lieutenant refused this tacit offer
of an armistice and was eager to prove
that he felt no affection for them he
called for an inspection of arms cloth-
ing and equipment not half an hour after
fresh stuff had been issued
  you are legionnaires and i expect
you to live up to your own standards
his inspection was as thorough as any
they had ever faced in barracks noth-
ing escaped him he counted the hand-
kerchiefs reserve-ration tins cartridges
even the hobnails on the boots and he
dribbled punishments as he paced down
the line

  two days special punishment-two
days dirty buttons-two days   
rusty bayonet scabbard-two days
practically all the survivors were pun-
ished even eyckman promoted to ser-
geant did not escape sloppiest non-
commissioned officer ive laid eyes on
mareuil announced have those chev-
rons stitched on properly by night or ill
see that you lose them

  promoted cited and decorated for val-
or owner of the military medal ser-
geant eyckman felt humiliated he put
on a bold front

  if my lieutenant will give me a tai-
lors address-

  i have no sense of humor while on
duty sergeant mareuil told him two
days special fatigue

punished men of course were al-
lowed no freedom lost privileges dear
to soldiers such as buying wine and
while members of the other companies
loafed the fifth worked mareuil saw
to that he volunteered them for any
chore available they drew water car-
ried it they toted ammunition-boxes to
and fro they marched a couple of kilo-
meters to help gunners prepare an em-
placement and as the battalion was on
duty to carry supplies to the front during
the evening hours they had to march
then also

  mareuil appeared to be constructed of
whalebone stretched on steel in super-
vising the scattered working-parties he
covered many miles from dawn to past
midnight and despite the heat the
dust he contrived to look fresh and clean
from his colonial regiment he had im-
ported an orderly taraorey better
known as koko-an enormous negro
light in color swift and silent as a panther
those among the legionnaires who had
dreamed of possible retaliation bysteal-
ing the officers belongings hesitated
koko always had a knife handy a coupe-
coupe twenty-odd inches of steel honed
to a razors edge

  naturally the captain commanding
noticed very soon that something was
wrong in the fifth company but

trained efficient officers were growing
scarce at gallipoli moreover mareuil
had a fine record in france had been
wounded twice

  kitchen gossip as rife in the darda-
nelles camps as elsewhere claimed that
captain jobard had tried to interfere
that he had spoken to mareuil asking
for the motive of his severity

  i am taking them in hand with a pur-
pose captain they have been hard
pressed true but there is a certain lack
of discipline an informal casual fashion
of obeying orders that i do not like
under campaign conditions such as
these my friend one may relax rules

   i do not believe so captain

  the captain might have done some-
thing about the situation if mareuil had
sent men to work but he led them
which was quite another thing at times
he even worked side by side with his
legionnaires stripped to his undershirt
giving the example of endurance and in-
dustry

  during the rare lulls when the men
expected to settle down to loaf he would
call the company out for drill his con-
tention was that some of the men did
not even know how to salute properly
he was right-many of them sought to
escape saluting him

  the annoying factor from the legion-
naires point of view was that he was
considered outside the battalion as an
energetic capable officer his constant
nagging had made his company one of
the neatest most orderly in the expedi-
tion and they were selected out of turn
to supply detachments for honor guards
funeral services additional chores

  life in the company was a hell under
that murderous sun with the constant
shelling the food was poor mostly
hardtack and tinned beef and the wine
scarcely deserved the name by the time
the barrels arrived the fluid was diluted
to pinkish water

the worst came when the battalion
attacked mareuil a very demon in
action led his sections to their objective
promptly stopping only when well in ad-
vance of the other companies in the
turkish second line the fifth as a whole
was complimented officially and he was
given a citation even the captain
could do no less than to shake his hand
publicly and congratulate him on a good
job

  back at the rear he was as harsh as
before by that time the men hated him

i
openly and being legionnaires they
started balking him in the hundred ways
that professional soldiers know supplies
vanished-cartridges blankets water-
tins-and always in some mysterious
fashion when the responsibility could not
be pinned to any one man mareuil
stormed questioned man after man-to
be met with wondering blank glances

  hell crack make a mistake his men
said hopefully we have him going
in their hatred for this martinet for this
tyrant they forgot the hardships the
horrors of their surroundings

  the motivation for mareuils behavior
in the legion suddenly became known
until then all had believed him simply a
tough man with a sadistic turn of mind
but an old fellow arriving from the base
at tenedos looked at him long and ear-
nestly muttering

  ive seen him somewhere

and within a day of that everyone
k seemed to identify mareuil at the
same time he had in his own opinion
good reason to detest the legion

  twelve or thirteen years before he
had come to indo-china as a sub-lieuten-
ant of tonkinese tirailleurs he was
then under twenty-one almost straight
from school and he had been placed in
charge of a fortified village on the chi-
nese border naturally he had felt im-
portant confident of quick promotion
a command in a dangerous zone first
thing

  unluckily for him a small detachment
of legionnaires in charge of a sergeant
had come to the village to rest after an
expedition against the black flags to
a green sub-lieutenant legionnaires were
not different from marine infantry he
had assigned them to quarters and for-
gotten them

  all would have been well normally
but the legion detachment was sudden-
ly seized with a spell of collective cajard
the men got drunk the sergeant also
when dawn broke half of the village was
a spread of smoldering ashes women
had been molested stores looted and two
native civilians killed the opposition
press in paris had enlarged on the epi-
sode common enough in primitive coun-
tries during conquest

  the repression and punishment had
been hard three of the legionnaires
identified as murderers went to hard la-
bor for twenty years ten more includ-
ing the sergeant who lost his chevrons
were sent to the disciplinary company

the rest drew from thirty days to three
months in jail

  mareuil although not a legion officer
had been technically in charge respon-
sible and faced a court-martial while
he received no actual punishment the
findings of the court were humiliating

  sub-lieutenant mareuil revealed a
complete inability to cope with the situ-
ation he showed a sad lack of initia-
tive energy and military authority ow-
ing to his youth and inexperience the
court dismisses him with an official
blame

 this was written down in his record
so he had vegetated as a sub-lieutenant
for eleven long years being skipped on
promotion-lists the war had given him
a chance to show what he could do he
had made the most of it attained a full
lieutenancy at last but his brooding
hatred nurtured in silence for those long
long years had flowered when oppor-
tunity offered

  mareuil was making sure that he
would not be accused again of lack of
energy initiative or authority he kept
the men so tired that they had no chance
to develop cravings

  the knowledge that they were bearing
unjust treatment for something others
had done many years before made the
legionnaires more impatient mareuil
was warned both officially and in pri-
vate by his legion colleagues but the
more he was warned the more stubborn
he grew

  the situation became unbearable

one day in punishment for some
fancied sin mareuil announced that
the rum and wine would not be issued
that day this brought open rebellion
men refused to work mareuil who did
not tolerate protest or insubordination
was already reaching for his revolver
when captain jobard appeared suddenly

  what is wrong here

  matters had gone too far to be ignored
the company was solidly united against
its officer wisely jobard maintained
the punishment until further notice and
led mareuil aside

  i dont want to disavow you openly
lieutenant but you know how the men
are about wine and theyre really en-
titled to double rations as they do spe-
cial work my advice is to relent youre
an excellent officer you have as fine a
company as even you could wish they
respect a man who can draw back from
an unjust hasty decision
  the order sticks captain mareuil
said clenching his jaws

  in that case i shall ask that you be
replaced

  i shall demand a hearing captain
this is scarcely the time or place for
such quarrels jobard said sadly he
indicated the sprawling camp down the
hill enough trouble from the enemy
without this dissension among ourselves
moreover a friendly word the general
commanding served in the legion for
years and will undoubtedly investigate
fully before blaming us come have
some sense

  the punishment was just and i hold
to it captain

  very well

 jobard walked away the legion-
naires had marched away according to
jobards order mareuil joined them
near the beach where they were shifting
a pile of supplies from the open to a
shed they did not stop as he came up
watched him quietly as he stripped off his
tunic he saw that they were waiting
for a word from him and he knew that
captain jobard was right if he relented
they were men enough to drop the mat-
ter but although his brain could formu-
late the thought he could not bring his
tongue to utter the words

  within himself he had come to ad-
mire the men they had faults griev-
ous faults the faults that had interrupted
his career but they were mens faults
soldiers faults their endurance cour-
age and devotion to duty had stirred him
he felt that with diplomatic handling
he could win them but that would have
been admitting defeat

  at first they were grimly silent then
they started conversations some of them
none too subtle ridiculing him and they
applied names to him that no one would
have fancied compliments at first he
pretended not to hear then his temper
rose and he glared at the speakers hos-
tility was almost open everyone knew
something was about to happen

  it was legionnaire rammon who pre-
cipitated a scene mareuil had cited
him for saving his life had treated him
with more friendliness than others so
he had at heart to prove that her was
solidary with the rest did not seek spe-
cial favors he had been murmuring like
the others

  mareuil turned suddenly and read his
lips

  legionnaire rammon 

  lieutenant  responded rammon

  thats the second time youve used
that word to me i forgot it the first
time you remember why but you will
apologize now-

  rammon a solid short chap of about
thirty grew a bit pale the tan standing
out like paint on his skin as the blood
left his face close to a hundred of his
comrades were watching him he was
no longer himself an individual but he
was the company

  i have nothing to apologize for lieu-
tenant

  you deny calling me a swine

i dont deny anything lieutenant
forget my rank mareuil held out
his bare arms you see no stripes on
them do you i want an apology man
to man 

  no

  mareuil stepped toward him in his
anger he forgot certain deep-rooted fac-
tors in the mens minds rammon was
strong muscular but he was half a head
shorter probably twenty pounds lighter
than his officer if he had quailed
stepped back mareuil would have come
to himself but he held his ground with
a defiant stare and said

  i warn you if you sock me ill sock
back

  and a clamor of approval rose from
the others for a moment the two stood
face to face under the downpour of sun-
light then mareuils control snapped
completely he had been under severe
nervous tension for days and the blow
was a release his clenched fist struck
rammon squarely on the left eye

  the result was beyond his wish the
blow not only knocked the private down
but the knuckles gashed the brow and
cheek rammon rolled to his knees
tried to rise then sank back on all fours
blood flowing freely from the cuts his
friends who had expected a fight had
seen only a brutal execution

their representative had been
brought down put out of action by a
single punch instantly the legionnaires
decided mareuil was not only a brute but
a coward he was bigger than rammon
he had awed him with his officers pres-
tige    the scene that followed was
indescribable

  the whole detachment surged forward
shouting threats the lieutenant stood
his ground for a second then even his
iron nerve snapped and he backed
toward the packing-case on which he had
left his tunic and pistol-holster his
fingers had closed around the butt when
eyckman and two other sergeants linked
arms and made a haven for him

  get out of our way you swine
you slob ive got a special bullet for
you    me too    wait until we get
in the front lines again  a bullet for
you    swine    kill him

  a danish private well over six feet
pawed at mareuil over the sergeants
shoulders waving a tanned fist the size
of a coconut me-i fight you me-
me-

  the scandal grew men of other units
came on the run-teamsters artillery-
men marines they knew only that an
officer had struck a private they joined
in the howling then an officer a major
rode his horse through the mob dis-
perse at once disperse at once come
on-get going  and the next moment a
detachment of zouaves approached at the
double with fixed bayonets

  at that moment eyckman had a bright
thought he told mareuil to climb over
the case and get to the other side of the
pile of supplies itll save a mess
lieutenant please i 

  bewildered smiling faintly for the
sake o appearance the officer obeyed
he felt very foolish very uneasy and
one unselfish concern tormented him
how badly had he hurt rammon he
was in the clear when the major rode to
his side dismounted and walked along
leading his horse by the bridle

  youd better identify the mutineers
now he said

  no mutiny mareuil shook his
head my fault i lost my temper and
struck a man thatll probably mean
my demotion

  i dont think so the majors voice
was sad there are too many incidents
of the sort the mens nerves are getting
raw with this constant bombardment
no one is safe for one minute anywhere
on this place day or night reinforce-
ments are few-and any day the turks
may get enough men to massacre us   
but an officer should keep calm

  after that mareuil faced several un-
pleasant interviews first there was the
question of possible charges of a court-
martial but rammon although he had
been struck while on duty flatly refused
to make a complaint then there was
the call upon the military police to
quash matters completely

  by night mareuil was out of the for-
eign legion assigned to a company of
senegalese his departure from the com-
panys camp was accomplished in silence
the men pretended not to see him not to
see koko and his black helpers as they
moved his belongings no one came for-
ward to shake his hand to wish him well

it was the following morning that
captain jobard rode in to see him
were going up for our turn in the line
tonight mareuil something worries me
you know i am informed that certain
threats are being made against you

  i know captain each man has a
special bullet for me they told me
and the lieutenant smiled grimly

  whatever you may think of our
chaps they dont threaten for fun my
concern is not merely for you mareuil
i want to avoid a worse mess for all of
us avoid your old company jobard
shrugged they can hate as long and
as hard as you do

  weeks passed-long weeks of fighting


two men rushed him and tore the gun from iiis hand

  the legion battalion on gallipoli was
decimated and reformed captain jo-
bard was killed other officers killed or
wounded from moudros came new
men who gathered around the nucleus
of survivors carried on the fight mare-
uil led his senegalese as well as he had
led legionnaires he was a soldier not
a philosopher and it did not puzzle him
that his blacks shouted allah as they
charged quite as loudly as the turks

  the sick man of europe the horrible
turk held off the armies of two great
healthy nations through the neck of
the sack formed by the peninsula new
divisions poured new cannon the first
nine days after the landing had cost the
allies eight thousand men the turks
fourteen thousand but what followed
dwarfed those appalling figures a fort-
night later in a single attack against the
australian positions the enemy dropped
ten thousand men a truce had to be
agreed upon to bury the dejul rotting in
the sun	-

  in london the minister who was re-
sponsible for the expedition was re-
placed by another but while ministers
lost their jobs brave men from great
britain and her dominions from india
from france from her african colonies
white brown black lost their lives hos-



pital ships bore away cargoes of man-
gled crippled soldiers brave men died
by the thousand by lead and steel by
sickness beneath the torrid sun thou-
sands more were shaken by fevers melted
to skeletons by dysentery

  and across the seas came fleets of great
vessels bearing fresh men the first di-
visions of kitcheners army insufficient-
ly trained unseasoned landed and fought
and died

  get results we must have results

  a great attack was planned on a july
morning at thirty minutes after four a
terrifying bombardment started the
allies land-batteries the big guns on the
warships pounded away for three hours
hurled seventy thousand shells metal and
explosive by the ton then the infantry
charged

  the fifty-second british division
headed for krithia the two french divi-
sions holding the left of the front headed
for the head of kerevez dere colo-
nials and senegalese zouaves and legion-
naires marines and line infantry all
participated the show all hoped that
this time the turks would be smashed
driven back that the road to constanti-
nople would be opened

  the first line of turkish trenches had
been crushed out of existence but the
second line held it was occupied by the
crack troops of the fourth division the
sinister tack-tack of machine-guns met
the advancing french mowed them down
in rows they kept on bayonets and
grenades cleared the defenders out-and
the third line held 

  the combat raged all day and all night
between those men who would not halt
and those who would not yield bits of
trenches were taken lost retaken lost
retaken seven eight nine times but
the flood of the allies was fed from the
scanty reservoir of men at the tip of
the peninsula while from all parts of the
ottoman realm reserve troops rushed to
replace the fallen

  it availed nothing to kill three or four
for one when two appeared to replace
each man lost the ruins of ancient
troy shook with the thunder of battle
hotter than that sung by homer

  at daybreak deafened and dazed by
the bombardment the survivors of the
fifth foreign legion company huddled
in shell-holes hugging the ground they
were a few more than sixty of whom a
full fifteen had landed with the original
formation eleven weeks before there
are men who seem to bear charmed lives
eyckman was one he wore the slender
gold-braid of adjudant and was once
more ranking survivor rammon was
another

  a runner arrived with the message
attack and occupy fortlet at seven-thir-

ty two rockets to indicate success
general attack seven-forty-five

  eyckman looked at the position the
distance was not great not over one hun-
dred and fifty yards the fortlet hardly
deserved the name it was an earthwork
forming a flanking salient in the line
it was necessary to take it to keep its ma-
chine-guns from enfilading the advance

at seven-twenty-five the turks laid
i down a barrage on the french
trench shells rained everywhere-heavy
stuff whenever a man showed himself
the enemy started firing rifles and ma-
chine-guns it seemed that nothing could
live ten seconds on that stretch of land
but the order had come and in a few
minutes eyckman would give the signal
they would pull their bodies into the
open rush on with the bayonet

 ready another minute passed
eyckman lifted his hand allons-y
they leaped out and started to run
crouching low machine-guns found
them instantly and the entire left sec-
tion was knocked out almost at once
a shell-burst killed two men in the cen-
ter of the line eyckman was thrown
down by the explosion the others fal-
tered halted then turned and leaped
back into shelter the commander
crawled back

 come on he ordered then he
pleaded come on come on-we cant
stay here-

the lieutenants revolver spat
a turk reversed his mauser
and started to swing
  the legionnaires did not move

  its no use chief one of them re-
plied its suicide even if we got
there we are not enough to clean the
dump out well all get killed for noth-
ing

  what difference does that make to
you eyckman demanded he saw
they were sullen determined all right
-if thats the way you feel take it this
way and he aimed his pistol at the
spokesman what do you say  here or
up there one-two-

  two men rushed at him from behind
tore the gun from his hand he raved
and struck them with his fists he felt
his brain snapping he was a legion
chief they were legionnaires and they
were refusing to go where he ordered
he battered at them like a madman for
some seconds then grew calmer and
started to weep tears streaking his dirty
face

  listen the general attack will start
and a lot of guys will be killed because
of you-

  give us water a man retorted i
dont want to die thirsty

  right give us water

  eyckman had no water to give them
he looked at his watch it was seven-
thirty-seven the turkish barrage had
lengthened skipped their position to
strike at the communication-trenches
probably stuffed with troops in eight
short minutes the attack would start
and the storming parties would be ripped
into from the flank by the machine-guns
in the fortlet he made his decision if
he was not in the place by the time the
attack was launched he would blow his
brains out

  what else could he do he could not
go back and say that legionnaires had
refused to die

  is this the fifth company legion
all turned toward the voice which had
slashed through the din mareuil stood
at a bend in the trench looking at them
behind him loomed the giant black
koko rifle slung the long blade in his
hand all the legionnaires knew him
for even the new men had had him point-
ed out all knew the story of thqvfeud
yes lieutenant

  whos in charge

  i am

  whats holding you up 

  when no one answered mareuil under-
stood and a smile of scorn appeared on
his lips dogging it eh  and so youre
legionnaires he waved his bandaged

left hand in derision you know ive
been waiting to see this i thought that
was the trouble and asked leave to come
over and see it makes me happy to see 
a lot of you guys deflated at last im
not in charge i have no order to give
you but i am going over there and you
can watch me

  he walked down the trench found a
slope easy to ascend the next instant
he was standing on the parapet in full
sight with the negro at his side he
looked at them still smiling

  captain jobard who died like a man
told me that every member of this com-
pany had a special bullet saved for me
im not asking the impossible-youre
not men who shoot in front but i am
going out there and you can all have a
chance at my back he started to
laugh and you see my back is not so
easy to hit-the turks are trying it

  it was true he and the senegalese
were outlined against the sky and sup-
plied targets for a hundred rifles and
both kept on their feet unscathed as if
invulnerable they were standing still
where racing men could not hope to live
mareuil spat to one side casually

  so long legionnaires 

  and he strode away

  eyckman opened his mouth to give an
order that was no longer needed he
was almost the last man in the trench

in thirty seconds the detachment was in
the broken wire before the turkish
trench flinging grenades the defenders
poured out to meet them it was the
sixth time in twenty-four hours that the
legionnaires fought hand-to-hand with
their foes

mareuil ran right into the heat of
the battle at his side koko wield-
ed the heavy blade the turks held
bravely for they were sturdy experienced
men from a good regiment some of them
as fair as saxons others almost as dark
as the negro an officer with a green sash
crossing his chest wearing an astrakhan
bonnet on which an enameled badge glis-
tened directed them he had a narrow-
bladed parade-sword which he used with
considerable skill

  the french lieutenant headed for him
lifting the revolver but his gun was
empty or he had no time to squeeze the
trigger two sword-blows struck him al-
most at once one on the forehead the
other a lunge through the breast the
turk cleared his blade and faced koko
who showed his teeth severed the turks
the blue book magazine

wrist with a first swing opened his face
from cheek to brows with the next

  then as the negro bent to lift his chief
a turk planted a bayonet in his loins
another fired point-blank into his skull
eyckman standing clear of the thickest
melee picked them both off with his pis-
tol the next moment the legionnaires
were sliding into the conquered position

  it was seven-forty-four the legion
was on schedule

mareuil was convalescing at mou-
dros two months later his wounds
had healed and he was due to leave for
salonika with a colonial regiment pro-
moted to captain officer in the legion of
honor he was now satisfied with his
progress when he encountered old
friends who remembered his former ha-
tred of legionnaires and grew cautious
when the legion was mentioned he hon-
estly wondered at their conduct he had
forgotten that for some twelve years
such references had brought his bitter
comments

  one of his regrets was that he had had
no chance to speak to the legionnaires of
the fifth after the storming of the fort-
let the words he had used had been
chosen deliberately to whip them into a
surge of energy into a final effort he
felt he had insulted weary spent soldiers
who must hate him the more for it

  i defied them he thought often
called them too cowardly to shoot me
from the front if one of them ever lo-
cates me somewhere and plugs me i
wont be able to blame him

  one morning an orderly told him
captain the march regiment of africa
is here to embark for the balkans you
used to serve in that outfit didnt you
with the legion battalion tf you want
to see them theyre not a mile away in
camp

  mareuil reddened i dont know any-
one there now-practically all who were
in the battalion have been killed but
a strange longing gripped him and he
walked over to look at them from a dis-
tance they had been issued new uni-
forms helmets but they retained their
unmistakable silhouettes they were sol-
diers warriors and mareuil grew sad to
think that of all their officers he was the
only one who could not find a friendly
hand among them

  the afternoon of the same day an or-
derly informed him that an officer was
outside the hospital grounds asking for
him mareuil went to meet him with-

out even asking the name there were
ten or fifteen people who dropped by
thus to take walks with him

  soldiers were lined up beside the road
wearing blue sashes over their khakj
legionnaires a sub-lieutenant stepped
forwarc came to attention saluted

  fifth company legion-captain

  it was eyckman a different eyckman
in a brand-new officers uniform his chest
displaying crosses and medals a few
days rest and good food had filled out
his face his drooping mustache had been
clipped

  on duty lieutenant mareuil asked
him refrained a first impulse to shake
hands he did not want to have his
hand scorned before a hundred and fifty
men by the way sincere congratula-
tions

  eyckman stepped back pivoted drew
his sword his brand-new sword com-
pany attention  present-arms 

  the bayoneted rifles jerked upright
forward the steel tips shone rigidly in
the sun two drums two bugles played
a call and captain mareuil looked back
at the gateway then up and down the
road to see who was honored save for a
group of orderlies watching from some
distance he was alone

  eyckman faced him again saluted him
with the sword

  company load rifles

  the breeches opened clacked shut
again with one single sound

  captain at the storming of ali-ta-
biey you reminded the fifth company
of a vow made concerning you that
each member of the company had a spe-
cial bullet spared for you legionnaires
never fail their word you shall get the
bullets due you

  the old defiant smile flashed on mare-
uils face of course he did not believe
that they had come to shoot him down
openly

  but he suspected some plan that was
meant to embarras and humiliate him
heat of battle

  tou are too kind lieutenant he re-
torted

  special detail forward-march    
halt

  five men had left the formation
stepped off six paces before coming to a
halt four of them presented arms the
fifth in the middle carried a small flag
a sort of company marker the staff of
which was surmounted by a gilded cres-
cent it was obviously a trophy captured
from the turks the cloth was scarlet
but little of it showed as it was covered
with a queer glittering ornamental ion of
metal

  the flag-bearer was legionnaire ram-
mon the survivor of all attacks and all
perils who carried only one scar away
from the dardanelles a scar made by a
chiefs knuckles

  by this time there was a crowd watch-
ing the ceremony eyckman stepped
toward the flag lifted the cloth by one
corner to spread it mareuil saw that it
was almost covered with rifle cartridges
each one set in a small socket as in a
bandoleer

  we have brought you those bullets
captain as promised a souvenir of
your old company

  mareuil understood that they did not
intend to humiliate him and he under-
stood also what they left unspoken they
had guessed his real motive in coming to
show them the way the morning of the
attack his jaw started to quiver he
sought to force words through his con-
tracting throat

  too many lieutenant the company
never mustered so many men

  never at one time captain eyck-
man paused then resumed but that
many passed through our ranks while
you were in command there is no mis-
take each one of these cartridges has
the name rank and matriculation num-
ber of its donor eyckman plucked one
of the metal cylinders from its socket
for instance this is mine

   mareuil read the inscription neatly en-
 graved on the brass

eyckman michel s

corporal sergeant adjudant lieutenant

  and here is another captain

          karlsen oscar 

first-class legionnaire killed in action

  mareuil remembered karlsen the big
dane who had challenged him to fight
that afternoon after he had knocked
down rammon the man had died days
before the storming of the little fort and
mareuil understood that the fifth com-
pany considered itself solidary beyond
life beyond death

  rammon had placed the trophy in the
captains hands he and the honor guard
had stepped back into formation

  mareuil shook hands with eyckman
tried to speak to express the thoughts
overwhelming him he could not his
eyes were wet his voice out of control

  illegal use of ammunition he whis-
 pered i could have you all court-mar-
 tialed

sub-lieutenant eyckman grinned

  shoulder arms right-face for-
ward-march he called out the orders
then trotted to take the lead as the
drums beat a rhythm

         on far-away campaigns

          when we face fever and fire

          we forget with all our pains
          death that forgets us never-

  then the buglers twirled their instru-
 ments on high polished metal shimmered
 in the sun and the blaring notes of the
 chorus throbbed out

  tiens voila du bond in-voila dn
boudin

  the march of the legion died away
in the distance a compact mass of khaki
receded but mareuil knew his destiny
was marked out from now on that he
was one of their own somewhere he
would lead those men again

nother legion story by georges surdez will appear in an early issue


a memorable story of the
english immigrant pioneers
who formed the albert
martin handcart company
and trudged across the con-
tinent to utah

lums for

the younger missionary said
its going to be an early
winter his companion add-
ed  youre lucky if the snow
dont catch you before you get through
the black hills

  they were on their way to the new
city which the latter day saints had
built in the valley by the great salt
lake they had put in two years across
the seas on their mission and they were
eager to get back home on that warm
september noontide when they overtook
the albert martin handcart company in
the nebraska river-bottom by the time
they had passed the long line of two-
wheeled carts with the men panting in
pairs between the shafts the women and
children trudging along behind anxiety
had increased their eagerness their eyes
were troubled as they looked down from
the seat of the spring-wagon into the sun-
burned face of the man who was leading
these poverty-stricken converts on foot to
distant zion

  albert martins eyes were holding the
same worry and before he answered
them he glanced around cautiously lest
some of these followers might be near
enough to overhear the carts were com-
ing through the checkered light and shade
of elms and basswoods the shrieking of
wheels on ungreased wooden axles rose
above the trees like a shrill complaint

  theyre doing the best they can he
said but theyre english folks and most
of em are from factory towns it was
late in july before they pulled out from
iowa city

  some of the women had fallen out to
gather wild plums and margaret was
among them she heard the voices of

 i



albert martin and the missionaries from
the thicket where she was standing but
she did not catch the words

  the branches of the wild plum trees
sank beneath their burdens of purple
fruit enframing her her hair and eyes
were dark her cheeks were dusky from
more than five hundred miles of prairie
sun and wind her lips were rich and
warm  a large-limbed girl with full
breasts and wide shoulders looping her
skirt to her knees to hold the plums which
she had gathered-you would not think
if you had seen her that she had never
looked down a wider vista than a dingy
street six months ago she was a vision
of rich fruitfulness-and she was in the
thrall of a vision the daydream of a girl
who has come into womanhood she saw
herself standing as now under branches
laden with purple fruit but the trees were
far from here and they were arranged in
ordered rows ever since she was a little
girl nursing four sickly geraniums in tin
cans on a narrow window-ledge she had
been taken with such dreams though they
had always been vague but this one was
as clearly outlined distinct in color as a
painted picture herself standing among
rows of plum trees in full fruit and the
trees were in zion beside the great salt
lake beyond the mountains there were
children around her and the man who had
given them to her was beside her he
was fair-haired and tall he was hand-
some and he was burgeoning with the
strength of youth

gathering up the reins the older
missionary said well be in salt
lake by october conference well tell
the brethren and theyll send back help
  he touched the horses with the whip
and the spring-wagon rattled away the
warm noontide passed and it vanished
across the nebraska prairies western rim
where the overland trail bisected the
enormous circle of level grasslands the
handcart company followed the setting
sun toward distant zion

  the men were dragging the two-
wheeled carts they went in pairs breast-
ing the cross-pieces which spanned the
shafts and the sweat stood out in drops
on their foreheads when they forded
one of the shallow streams whose tim-
bered fringes flaunted patches of gold
and scarlet where the early frosts had
touched the leaves the women fell in be-
hind to help them up the brief steep rise
on the western side several covered
wagons and a half dozen milch-cows fol-
lowed in the rear the screaming of the
wheels hovered over the bronze prairie
streaked with goldenrod and wild asters
it drowned the remote clamor of wild
geese which were fleeing southward be-
fore the oncoming winter

margarets father said i do feel
my strength is coming back girl
the cart pulls more easy-like

  youre looking better father she
told him the red is in your cheeks
today

  she was pressing her breast against the
cross-piece which spanned the narrow
shafts her brown hands clenched the
polished hickory she strode beside the
little man as if she were not conscious of
the clumsy cart and its top-heavy load
the dust had mellowed her brown dress
to a gray tan the flimsy skirt clung to
her limbs revealing the fullness of their

splendor and as she glanced at the
worn face with the two hectic patches on
the thin cheeks her thoughts went back
to smoky streets she remembered the
close-hung walls of factories and the sour
grass which was the only thing that
would consent to grow upon her mothers
grave the bearded mormon missionary
preaching of brigham youngs revela-
tions and the promised land in a little
room where a dozen pallid men and wom-
en crouched on two hard benches

beside a prairie lake bordered with
tall reeds which whispered to the
evening breeze they camped that night
the men managed to find enough wood
for decent fires when the supper was
over the women brought plums and
passed them around after the others
had fallen asleep margaret searched
in the faint light of the dying embers for
the pits of the plums she gathered
enough to fill a huge blue kerchief she
knotted the kerchief into a tight bun-
dle and thrust it into a corner of her
handcart then she stole back to her
blankets walking on tiptoe as a girl does
when she is keeping her own intimate
secrets and she lay down on the tough
prairie sod to think long thoughts of that
warm noontide to see herself again as
she had then standing between the ranks
of trees whose branches were bending to
their loads of purple fruit with her chil-
dren around her and the man who had
given them to her beside her fair-haired
and tall filled with the strength of youth

  the mellow sunlight was bathing the
wide prairie when the line of handcarts
started into the west the next morning
the voices of men and women and the

thin treble of children rose above the
shrieking of the wheels they were sing-
ing o zion lovely zion and as she
glanced at her fathers white face it oc-
curred to her a tardy premonition pass-
ing swiftly as warnings so often pass the
young that perhaps he would never see
zion

  late in the day low sand-hills broke
the evenness of the horizons rim ahead
of them and a few days after that
they were trudging below the banks of
dunes which were no higher than the
swells on a stormy sea the transition
from the prairie to the great plains
was as imperceptible as the waning of
a sick mans strength

  then they discovered that they were
walking over a harsh wide plain where
the bleaching headboards of graves
stood like mile-posts beside the trail
one afternoon margaret saw laramie
peak against the skyline blanched with
fresh snow and that night she awoke
to hear her fathers coughing through
the drone of a bitter gale sweeping down
from the northwest she got up and took
from her bed its best blanket and while
she was tucking it around him she heard
the long-drawn howl of a buffalo-wolf
there was a skim of snow on the ground
when she crept from her scanty covers
in the gray twilight of the dawn her
fingers were numb with cold and she
was shivering so violently that she had
hard work kindling the fire of buffalo-
chips the carts were beginning to
pull out by the time she went to the
whitened mound where her father was
lying and laid her hand upon his shoul-
der he did not stir-it seemed to her
at first that he was not breathing and
it took her so long to rouse him that
the others were almost out of sight be-
fore she had her load stowed away and
started on the trail

that day and during the gray days
thereafter while the albert martin
handcart company was struggling
through the steep ravines and over the
wind-swept red bluffs on the southern
fringe of the black hills she strode
alone between the shafts and her fa-
ther staggered along behind on the
bitter morning when they came down
to the lowlands approaching the last
crossing of the platte she carried him
from his blankets laid him on the load
and wrapped the covers about him and
because she was what she was she did
not give a thought to the added weight

during the weary hours that followed
while she was panting through the
loose sand pressing her full breasts
against the cross-bar she had been
made to bear such burdens their ac-
ceptance was as natural as the vision
whiclthad come to her in the wild-plum
thicket on a warm noontide weeks ago
and that was as natural as life itself

on the night of the first snow the
oxen had stampeded the cows now
were drawing the covered wagons there
was no milk for the children and the
daily ration had been diminished to a
double handful of flour for every able-
bodied man the women got only half
as much and it never occurred to mar-
garet to protest when she was handed
her small allotment but the lack of
food was bringing weakness and the
weakness was bringing a curious de-
tachment it seemed to her that day
as if the others were not there she
was not conscious of the shrieking of
the wheels and when the man before
her fell between the shafts and crawled
off the trail she passed him without
seeing him   

  there was a grove of cottonwoods
beside the river and several fires were
flaring there in the dusk when margaret
came into camp her body was racked
with weariness and her arms were like
lead but it was no trouble to lift her
fathers slight form from the load and
lay him down

  it snowed during the night by morn-
ing it was blowing hard and the wind
was driving a white fog of flakes before
it the fog eddied upon the open flat-
lands and the sharp-nosed bluffs beyond
were dull white against the lowering
clouds outside the grove of cotton-
woods where the bank fell away to a
sandbar several men were digging a
long grave and six still forms lay on
the heap of sand beside the trench the
sides of the river were lined with ice
the thin sheets of ice were cracking
loudly dissolving into a multitude of
little cakes as the first handcarts started
to make the ford the gravediggers
looked up at the sound of a girls voice
and saw margaret standing before
them holding her fathers body in her
arms

  i want one of you to pray for him
she said pray that he reaches zion

  she stood there while they covered
the bodies and heaped boulders on the
low mound to keep the wolves away


she listened to the prayer which one of
the elders made and then she went back
into the cottonwoods

  a few minutes later she came forth
breasting the cross-bar between the carts
shafts she dragged the cart down the
bank and waded out into the current
where masses of slush ice floated half-
submerged the men watched her
climb the farther bank the wind was
whipping her dripping skirt against her
body and she vanished in a whirling
cloud of snow   

  sometimes when she thought of her
fathers death she tried to understand
why it had brought so little of sorrows
pain to her she did not realize how
strong a comfort she was finding in the
knowledge that he was no longer walk-
ing this weary road and had found a
shortcut to zion she did not remem-
ber the burden which had been lifted
from her shoulders but there was in
these bleak days and bitter nights a
memory that did abide it was in her
mind when she awakened every morn-
ing and it stayed before her during the
long hours while she was dragging the
handcart up the slow hills besicte the
sweetwater the picture of fruit-laden
trees herself among them and her chil-
dren and always the man who had
given her those children fair-haired
handsome and tall  it had become
a deeper thing than her religion it
was a part of her she was as sure of



its fulfillment as if it had already come
to pass

 the storm which had begun on the
night when her father died hung on
by the end of the week nearly two feet
of snow was lying on the level and
there were places where the wind had
piled the drifts to the height of a tall
mans waist the weakened cattle were
not able to keep up the wagons were
lost somewhere behind now the mem-
bers of the albert martin handcart
company no longer united in camp
when night came they gathered in lit-
tle groups and lay down beside the trail
wherever darkness found them but
every evening before margaret wrapped
her blankets around her she went to
her cart and groped in the box until her
fingers touched the bundle of plum-
pits to make sure that it was there

it was on the ninth day after the last
crossing of the platte that she came
upon paul stone

 there had been forty of them hud-
dled in a bunch of willows under a rim-
rock bluff the night before and the men
had made a great fire of driftwood for
the sweetwater took a sharp bend here
and many logs had lodged against the
bank the flank of the bluff had given
them a lee and the flames had licked
the placid air all night long but in the
morning there were thirteen dead ly-
ing wrapped in their tattered blankets
the blue book magazine

and when margaret started up the
trail it was as if her limbs did not be-
long to her as if they were dead weights
like the cart which she was dragging

  the road passed into wide treeless
uplands stippled with clumps of sage-
brush  the little clusters of sage had
caught the drifting snow and the pla-
teau was like a pallid sea broken into
sharp swells by the driving gale al-
ways the gale came from the hidden
pass in the west where the waters of
the continent divided it kept striving
to drive her back it whipped her skirts
against her legs it flung the powdered
snow into her face

it was as if time had ceased she did
not know whether it was morning
or afternoon when she felt something
lurching against the cart and looked
around to learn what had caused the
shock the powdered snow was blind-
ing her and she would not have dis-
covered him if she had not heard his
voice then it was so faint that it bare-
ly reached her through the humming of
the storm it was as husky as the rus-
tling of dry leaves in a wind she dashed
the snow from her eyes and caught
sight of him as he was disappearing in
the fog of driven flakes then the same
thing that had made her forget her fa-
thers weight upon the load the thing
that had caused her to nurse those sick

his voice was
little better than
a whisper
thank cod you
came

geraniums in tin cans on a window-sill
when she was a little girl that had
brought to her the vision in the wild-
plum thicket took command of her
once more she dropped the cross-bar
and slipped out from between the
shafts she ran to him and she threw
her arm around him just in time to
save him from pitching forward into
the gathering drifts

  a lank man in a tattered overcoat
his head was wrapped in a scarf which
he had made from sacking he was in-
credibly gaunt there was a thin fringe
of beard ringing his face there were
white patches of frostbite above the
beard his eyes were so deeply sunken
that they seemed to have disappeared
a mockery of a man and his voice was
but little better than a whisper

  thank god you came

  she picked him up and weak though
she was she hardly felt the weight of
him in her arms she carried him to
the handcart and wrapped him in her
blankets just as she had wrapped her
father one morning it seemed a long
long time ago she laid him on the
load and she went on

  it was the last that she remembered
thrusting her body against the cross-
bar pressing forward against the bliz-
zard the thing that drove her was
plums for zion

stronger than herself it was so strong
that when the land began to break and
the trail turned down to the crossing of
the river she was not conscious of the
storm of the cold that was biting her
body of the snow that blinded her eyes
she thought that she was standing
among the plum trees with her chil-
dren and the man whom she loved be-
side her

  and so her body did the things which
it did whde her mind was far away
the bank which led down to the sweet-
water was steep there were some rocks
which jutted through the snow that
clogged the trail the cart descended
to the water with a rush and over-
turned and when she tried to right
it she saw that one of the wheels was
dished paul stone was lying beside
the wreck she stopped long enough to
retrieve the plum-pits in the litter of
camp utensils before she picked him
up and she clung to the precious bun-
dle while she waded through the stream
with his lank form cradled in her arms
her fingers were still clenching the pits
when she sank down beside the road a
few minutes later she wrapped her arms
around him and pressed her body close
to him to give him some of its warmth

the younger missionary announced
theyre dead these two

  he stood with his broad back to the
storm beside the covered wagon and
his companion looked down from the
drivers seat through the fog of snow
upon the still forms somewhere be-
hind them other canvas-covered wag-
ons were hidden in the blizzard they
were coming slowly down the trail out
of the west twenty stout teams and
forty men the rescue expedition which
the two missionaries had promised al-
bert martin on that noonday in the
river-bottom it was more than three
weeks since they had set forth from
the valley beside the great salt lake

 the older missionary wrapped the
reins around the brake-handle then he
climbed down from the wagon seat and
as he stood there gazing at the two who
lay so still in the drift he caught sight
of the bundle in the girls clenched
hand he bent down and pulled off his
mitten he fingered the cloth

  feels like plum-pits he said and
then shes living all right sos her
man

  they lifted the two into the wagon-
bed there was a little stove under the

  canvas cover the older missionary
  resumed his seat and picked up the
  reins and the younger man remained in
  the rear to minister to the rescued pair
  while his companion drove on

  when margaret came back to the
  world which she had been so near to
  leaving for all time there were a dozen
  others in the wagon and she was lying
  beside paul stone as soon as she was
  able to move unaided she took over the
  task of nursing him it was slow work
  the team was plodding westward again
  before he opened his eyes the horses
  were setting back against the frost-
  rimed breeching on the down-grade be-
  yond south pass on the day when he
  was able to sit up with the help of her
  arm around him and during the days
  which had intervened she had served
  that rack of skin and bones as women
  serve their helpless men against the
  stealthy assaults of death it was as
  it had been when she had watered the
  sickly plants on the window-sill as it
  had been when she had tended her fa-
  ther on the trail but there was some-
  thing which made this battle appeal to
  her more strongly than those others had
  and when she saw that it was won the
  triumph left her in the possession of
  greater tenderness than she had ever
  known

    the line of covered wagons crossed the
  wind-swept flats it followed the winding
  trail over hills where twisted cedars stood
  out darkly against the snow it crossed
  green river on the ferry among floating
  ice-cakes and came into the canons of the
  wasatch

    to margaret it all seemed as natural
  as if she had always known that it was
  coming-as if it had been prearranged
  ever since she xould remember on that
  afternoon when the teams were descend-
  ing emigration canon and paul stone
  asked her to be his wife it seemed so
  natural that she did not pay any attention
  to the others who were huddled around
  them in the wagon it was as if those
  gaunt-faced men and women were not
  there

    there had been a chinook wind the
  week before one of those moist warm
  breezes which help to make the winters
  kinder in the inter-mountain country than
  they are in the broken lands of the con-
  tinental divide the snow had melted in
  the salt lake valley and the wide plain
  lay below them golden in the sunshine
  the two of them got to their feet and they


plums for zion

stood behind the drivers seat she with
an arm around him gazing down at last
at zion

  he was so weak that he could not stand
long in the lurching wagon the skin was
still tight over the bones and his face was
like a mask which has shrunken his
shoulders drooped and his body was but
little more than a skeleton-a travesty of
a man and when she fondled the bun-
dle of plum-pits that evening after she
had promised to marry him the vision of
the trees in ordered ranks with purple
fruit weighing down their limbs returned
to her she saw herself among them-but
that was all she saw   

  nature moves slowly and the changes
come so imperceptibly that oftentimes
one is not sensible of what has taken place
until long afterward a mormon bishop
in the ward where the newly married cou-
ple lived told his people one sunday that
winter of a revelation which had come to
him and as a result of his tidings an ex-
ploring expedition went forth from the
salt lake valley into the mild warm
southlands near the colorado river
which the latter day saints have since
named dixie paul stone went with them
as a teamster

  so it happened that on a balmy day in
april margaret was making garden alone
in the ten-acre patch at the northern edge
of salt lake city which had been al-
lotted to her and her husband and when
the sun was at its warmest in the middle
of the afternoon she was planting her
plum trees-tiny trees which she had
raised in tin cans during the winter from
the seeds which she had gathered back
there in the prairie river-bottom months
before she was planting the seedlings in
ordered rows when paul returned to her

  then her vision came to her again just
as she had seen it so often in those weary
days and bitter nights herself standing
between the trees whose branches were
bending to loads of purple fruit-and the
man whom she loved was standing beside
her those grown trees were still only a
dream but time and nature had finished
the work of whose beginning she had not
been conscious the man was handsome
and tall the strength of youth was in
him she looked into his eyes and saw
that he was no dream but was real
and she felt the first stirring of life with-
in her then reminding her that in the
days to come when these tiny seedlings
were trees and their branches were laden
with plums she was also to see real
children gathered here about her

a weird south seas drama by the
distinguished author of the eerie
island and the flaming sword

by beatrice
grimshaw

  daru in the far west of papua
  which lies in the coral sea
  above the loneliest side of
  australia which is at the end
  of the world-daru never changes

    i would go back to daru i would see
  again the flaming woods of claret and
  gilt and amber croton trees afire like a
  spilled sunset against the parrot-green
  of sago and mango i would hear the
  black waves of the wicked gulf of papua
  grave of noble men hissing on dark
  sands below the two-three houses of the
  tiny town i would feel the enormous
  loneliness of the place the silent men-
  ace of its untamed hinterlands press
  on me like a cloud i would sip danger-
  ously the burning ichor that is there dis-
  tilled from utter freedom from the sense
  that no one lives no one knows no one
  cares for two steps beyond daru the
  wild begins and after the wild the un-
  known

    and daru does not change world
  troubles do not touch it world news
  does not come to it it sits alone

     january in papua is the hot month of
  the year will perry the planter who
  had come down from the fly estuary to
  the little station of daru with a tail of
  native laborers to sign off was as well
  accustomed to the searing climate of new
  guinea as any man might be who had
  lived there seven years without change
  stan salter the young patrol officer
  member of a service as romantic and as
  famous as the northwest mounties or
  the cape police was tough by nature
  and by training but even they found


ierry seized i lie bamboo and pitched it nut of the window

themselves obliged to complain of this
particular summer day

  in the store where one bought tinned
meats and fruits tinned bacon and eggs
tinned cabbages and puddings they met
each man with his sleeves cut short and
his shirt open to the waist dashing the
streams of perspiration from wet fore-
heads with the flat of dripping arms

  never knew it worse in january tall
will perry worn too thin by fever and by
heat said staring with sun-paled blue
eyes at the hot waves bursting on the
sand below the house salter four and
twenty to perrys thirty lately from mel-
bourne sophisticated and educated and
trained in the anthropological lore that
will despised answered obliquely it
takes a few hundred years of this en-
vironment to adapt oneself like the na-
tives

  will was drinking a bottle of beer out
of the neck it was not much cooler than
hot tea but beer is always been   
he finished it before he replied wiping
his mouth theres where you new
chums full of university rot are wrong
theres men who can live like natives
and like it there was cook-no rela-
tion to james-who went up the turama

and stayed there for fifteen years and
brought a wife and she had a baby
and died because she was what the na-
tives call  nother kind and anyhow
the turamas no place to have kids in
cook was drowned in the river bore and
now theres jan cook

  never met him salter said screwing
the neck of a bottle a lump of ice
would be just it he regretfully told the
storekeeper and then because a patrol
officer must be hard laughed and added
one of the little things you learn not to
want

  iler corrected perry man alive
if you werent so new to the coun-
try youd know all about jan even
though she doesnt advertise-like bobs
who was bobs carelessly inquired
the younger man and then without wait-
ing for an answer whos this

perry set down the emptied bottle
looked out for a moment into the fiery
dazzle of the coral roadway drew back
his head and said january cook
what did they call her that for
salter asked curiously the girl who
was swinging lightly barefoot toward
the store was handsome he thought
the blue book magazine

rather than pretty something strange
and wild about her face hands and feet
burned to darkish copper hair black
thick short and outstanding eyes so
definitely blue and mouth so sharply cut
that you couldnt give her a drop of na-
tive blood and yet-yet she did remind
you somehow of the dark girls in the
village at the other side of daru those
slim half-naked girls who dance on
moonlight nights dance with the very
heart of passionate savagery in them
queer    she was dressed in the sort
of cotton frock that white women wear
she had no shoes but every finger- and
toenail was smoothed and tended she
came into the store nodded to perry and
asked the storekeeper in perfect english
and with a cultivated accent for some
tea    not a native by so much as one
sixteenth and yet-

  salter saw suddenly that perry was
staring hard at jan why he thought
the chaps in love with this young sav-
age he looked hard at january cook
again and she seemed to him now
more than handsome it might be be-
cause he had sensed the passion for jan-
uary of the other man it might be be-
cause he saw the girl nearer but she
was on the moment beautiful desirable
and she did not care whether he was
alive or dead you could see that

  you didnt much like it-if you were
a young patrol officer with a good opin-
ion of yourself

  the girl took her parcel away with her
passing so near to perry as she went
out that the starched folds of her short
cotton frock brushed against him sal-
ter heard perry catch his breath but
neither he nor january spoke

when the girl was gone salter de-
manded  whats she called that
for  where does she come from  whys
she knocking about daru by herself

  if its any business of yours the
other told him she was called january
by cook because she was born in jan-
uary in the hottest weather and it killed
her mother as i said but shes always
been a sort of hot-weather kid-loves it
when the thermometer goes to a hundred
with rain in the air seems to sort of blos-
som out-it would finish her if you took
her to australia but shes never been
when cook was drowned by the turama
bore and she was only three months old
the natives took her and nursed her and
when she was eleven the mission began
making a fuss about it and they took her

over shes twenty-one now and her own
mistress but she lives more or less with
a retired mission lady who looks after
her-and you might as well set a white
rabbit to look after a wildcat any more
questions

  one more the patrol officer coolly
answered are you going to marry her 

the elderly storekeeper leaned bare
elbows on his counter and grinned
this was pepper this was fun two
white men almost at each others throats
because of jan cook-a decent girl
theres never any doubt pro or con
about that in tropical houses with walls
almost open and native servants silently
prowling night and day but who was
certainly-odd

  who had a papuan sorcerer for a foster-
brother and used to go off to the bush
with him god-knows-what queer business
-nothing scandalous of course brothers
were brothers among the natives-but
shed be away half the night sometimes
and come back with her face all shut up
and not a word to throw to a dog or a
deserving trader and she knew the
drum-talk which no white person you
might say knows and the old mission
lady was worried about her-because
she said she didnt see how jan cook
was ever to get decently married which
the old mission lady being an old maid
herself seemed to think a good deal more
important than in the view of the some-
time married trader it was

  perry the thin tall man with the sun-
faded eyes was in love with her of
course but nobody knew what she
thought about it and here was the new
patrol officer asking him was he engaged
to her as like as not perry would
paste him one on the snoot-government
or no government-for his trouble   

  but there was to be no such lightening
of the weight of the long island day
for a deserving trader after all be-
cause into the very midst of that tense
situation into the dusky store with its
clinking billy-cans and oily-smelling to-
bacco and piles of calicoes and strings of
beads into the out-back solitude of daru
where no one ever came thora cum-
mings erupted  pencil-slim perfectly clad
with the newest sandal and the newest
eye-veil the latest make-up and a mass
of cleverly coiffed light curls this epit-
ome of civilization and of sydney and
of lands beyond the coral sea-thora
poised sophisticated perfect came in
and took possession of daru
  a crackling fire of questions and an-
swers put perry abreast of the situa-
tion thora the sister of the assistant
resident magistrate had been expected
in a month or so on a visit to daru sta-
tion she had changed her mind and
come earlier the schooner that brought
her across from thursday island lay at
the jetty and the arm greeting her
had asked her to go on to his house and
on the way tell the storekeeper to hurry
up certain goods

  that was that the storekeeper be-
came busy thora swept the building
and the men with one comprehensive
smile and said shed be going and
perry who had hardly shut his aston-
ished mouth since she came in waked up
and said hed show her the way salter
had meant to do it salter with the swift
decision that comes to men in girl-starved
surroundings had already told himself
that this was his bit of skirt that there
wasnt another white man in the place
outside of the storekeeper and the mar-
ried customs and the arm and
perry-that the coast was clear and he
was in luck

  and then perry that mad hatter from
the back of beyond jans admirer too
for what that might mean-perry had
jumped at her like a dog at a bone and
gone pff down the blazing coral walk



sailor sat up whats wrong cripps

among the flaming croton trees with this
bit of sydney in its white frock and its
cobweb stockings and they were out
of sight and in the store and beyond it
there was no sound save the creaming
hiss of waves falling upon black sand

  salter swung away from the store
cripps the storekeeper left alone looked
after him and grinned an old man out
of things and set away in the top gallery
of life for the rest of his days he might
yet he thought to himself see something
entertaining on the stage below before
very long

jan going home parsed like a splash
of light thrown up from the sea she
had the native knack of moving as
natural objects move swiftly and almost
unnoticed but cripps saw her there
was little he did not see he shouted
after her hi jan your fancy mans
gone off with the other girl and watched
for the result there was none the
girl did not even turn her head she
went by with the sunlight playing in her
hair striking lights of red and amber into
its dense black mass cripps took his
eyes off her for a moment in that mo-
ment she was gone like the natives
he thought i lay she has their trick of
runnin backward when she likes

  he wondered for a minute or so wheth-
er she really fancied perry or not until
the present moment he had supposed it
to be all the other way but now-
well he thought i might as well
go down and tally my stuff ashore as sit

here chewin the rag about people who
dont know whether im dead or alive
and dont care

  there was a dance that night on the
black-sand beach perry had seen it all
a hundred times but he wasnt tired of
it he liked as ever to stand by the side-
lines and let the thrum-thrumming of
the lizard-skin drums the rhythmic bob-
bing and swaying of paradise headdresses
under the flare of torches the sensuous
rapt faces of the dancers invade him
like a stupefying drink you lost your
personality listening and looking you
shed your sense of place and time you
were sucked into something that led out
beyond plain sensuality never absent
you knew the influence of the nameless
forces that lived in the out back up the
lonesome rivers and in the enormous for-
ests where no man dwelt where silence
was a thing that did not merely exist
that was kept   

  the girl from sydney was beside the
planter she watched the dancers with
complete incomprehension she compared
their steps audibly with the black bot-
tom and the big apple and said she could
do better herself perry thought her a
little fool and longed at the same mo-
ment to kiss her till she couldnt think
or speak

  he had stood within touch of january
cook when the maddening native dance
was going on he had seen her bosom
under its muslin smock heave with the
desire to join in and she could do it
he thought no white man had ever
seen the girl dancing even as no white
knew what she did and where she went
when she disappeared for a day and a
night into the wilds but perry knew
that shed understand the things he un-
derstood  that the wilderness had set its
brand on her as on him he had known
for some while that she would make for
him the ideal mate and he had guessed
that she wouldnt say no when in due
time-there was never any hurry in daru
daru at the end of the world-he found
voice to put the question

but now the tempo of the outside world
had suddenly invaded daru along
with and surrounding the personality of
thora she was full of hurry and curi-
osity  she wanted to see everything to go
everywhere she had asked a thousand
questions many of which perry found
himself unable to answer although he un-
derstood their subjects as a man under-
stands his own face in the mirror she

was going to look on at the native dance
she was going out in canoes she was go-
ing to see a dugong hunt she wanted to
watch turtles coming ashore to lay their
eggs and see them intercepted and turned
by native watchers on the beach and
she hjd already decided it seemed that
perry-tall slim perry with the blue
sun-faded eyes and sun-battered skin-
was to be her cavalier for the time be-
ing she had turned the full blaze of her
charm upon him and he had instantly
gone down he didnt approve of her
one bit he thought her silly and restless
and conceited-and he was all the same
and suddenly deep-drowned in love

  under the prussian-blue night sky that
was beaded with sparkling stars they
stood together fought mosquitoes and
watched the dancing perry wasnt
drunk with the dance now it was a head-
ier draught that held him things were
moving he was wide awake already
he was beginning to plan a journey south
and a parson

salter looking as romantic as he
knew how in his khaki bush outfit
with cartridge-belt and service revolver
was posing not very far away he was
there more or less on duty there had
been times when these dances growing
too strenuous had ended in the snatching
of parked spears stabbing and blood but
he wasnt thinking of that he felt rather
like something in a western film hoped
he looked it hoped thora saw him

  he never saw what cripps who was
lurking near him saw jan cook tall
and still now not a strand of her heavy
hair stirring not a finger or a fold of her
dress that wasnt stone-quiet jan look-
ing steadily at something out of the cor-
ners of her long gray eyes cripps didnt
need to turn round in order to know what
she was watching the back of his neck
prickled he had been long in daru

  he edged away inconspicuously to the
spot where salter was standing bit
lonely he asked the young man not
without spite salter said do you
want anything he wasnt going to
discuss his defeat

  the trader said yes what do you
suppose kalipas doing here tonight if
youve any attention left over from that
little piece of sydney goods opposite

  what kalipa that handsome chap
whos dancing so well  i reckon he came
to show the others how to do it

  kalipas the biggest sorcerer in the
west-and jans foster-brother
january girl

  that so the young officer stared
he saw a papuan man splendidly made
all but naked decked out in native jew-
elry of boar-tusks and dogs teeth with
a necklace of human finger-bones about
his throat he saw that the man was
dancing as if by accident nearer and
nearer to the spot where perry and
thora stood that the strange gray eyes
of january cook caught kalipas black
eyes every now and again that the
foster-brother and sister seemed with-
out words to be communicating

  salter immediately snapped into the
character of government officer tt was
his by no means secret pride to belong
to this famous perilous service and
every man in the service knew that sor-
cery was mostly murder

  if theres any nonsense going he said
sharply ill be on the fellow

  if theres any nonsense going cripps
mockingly repeated you probably wont
things will happen-as they happen
just naturally

  salter hadnt time to express his con-
tempt for such a point of view because
january whom he really admired when
he wasnt looking at thora had started
to slip away quite quietly quite nat-
urally as if she were a little tired of the
dance and wanted to go home to the mis-
sion ladys and have a cup of tea cool-
ly too-her face and arms and her bare
ankles were dry as ivory when everyone
else salter included was sweating like
meat in the frying-pan she was not nat-
ural he thought this girl born in the heat
of the year she was a salamander  j 
but the salamander that fabled beast
didnt even feel flame and january un-
less her gray eyes lied knew the scorch
of one kind of flame at least

  before he knew what had happened to
her she was gone and he remembered
cripps odd saying-that jan had all the
native tricks that she could disappear
when you took your eye off her like a
snake and-

  kalipa was gone too but salter with
the corner of his eye had caught a
glimpse of that departure the sorcerer
had danced lightly backward until he
neared the tangle of surroundingtroton
bush then he simply ran back like a
reversing engine and vanished

ery well thought salter detach-
er ing his interest from thora and
perry very well i maynt be able to
do that but i reckon i know where to find
the mission ladys house and i must

find it because this is business this is
a job

  thunder never far away in the hot
season bumbled and thumped above the
black-sand beach as he turned away a
river of lightning poured in its sudden
sheen you could see the white teeth the
glittering eyeballs of the dancers then
you could see almost nothing at all rub-
bing his eyes the patrol officer walked
away

 the mission ladys house a small
building of iron stood among clustered
palms wind was getting up now the
palm fronds thrashed upon the roof with
angry hands extinguishing the sound of
salters footsteps on the coral walk
there wasnt much sound in any case
the young man had done detective work
down south in sydney and when he
wasnt thinking of girls or grog or din-
ner he could do an excellent sherlock
holmes job yet

quietly he circled the house there
was a veranda-nobody there there
was a lit bedroom window modestly
covered with thick calico that would be
the mission ladys there was another
window curtained with the sort of gaudy
colored stuff that looks opaque in the
daytime and by night proves itself some-
times to be nothing of the kind to this
window salter turned his attention he
wanted to know simply whether jan was
in the stuff was as he had guessed
transparent light inside turned low
no one there

  he drew aside into the clump of palms
and quite patiently waited he waited
two hours it was nothing to the vigils
hed had down sydney harbor on freez-
ing august nights he could wait all
night if necessary in this heavy warmth

  there the light had suddenly gone
up it was a hurricane-lamp somebody
had come in and turned up the wick
salter waited a minute slipped to the
window-and almost immediately stag-
gered back against the veranda wall
gasping im not mad he said to him-
self im not drunk i did see it

  his thick fair hair felt strange did
hair ever really stand on end he ran
his fingers through it    the scalp
was sweating but the hair lay flat

  that reassured him and he ventured to
look again

  yes jan was standing in the middle
of her room staring at a length of carved
bamboo which was actually bobbing and
shuffling about on end like the dancers
the blue book magazine

who had been bobbing and shuffling
down on the black-sand beach hours ago
they were long since asleep in the village
but here was this infernal thing the very
sight of which his blood run cold carry-
ing on the dance as if it were alive and
jan was looking at it speaking to it he
couldnt catch what she said somehow
he didnt want to he swallowed a great
many times in a throat that had suddenly
gone dry and wondered what in the name
of all the fiends he ought to do there
was nothing the regulations told him
if he jumped into the room why that
hellish thing would assuredly be found
lying on the floor just a bit of bamboo
a few feet long and jan would be want-
ing to know in no very courteous terms
what on earth he meant by breaking into
her bedroom

  he thought of spiritualistic tales he
had read-about people who had gained
power to make pencils stand on end yards
away to order a tangle of muslin to
untangle itself and float free without
touching it things like that happened
and people said when they did that it
was either fraud or the powers of evil

  well it wasnt fraud here unless he
was crazy and he didnt believe in pow-
ers of evil and-there he had made
a slight noise-and the whole scene was
changed jan was sitting on her bed
pulling off her dress and the bamboo was
lying flat on the floor in a shadowy cor-
ner had he dreamed it all 

  it was a considerably chastened patrol
officer who slipped away from the mis-
sion ladys house and silently went to
bed in the quarters taking his problem
with him he hadnt spoken to the rm
-yet it seemed a bit too personal

the hot weather continued  the flam-
ing stillness of the days torn at times
by thunder and by furious rain the pur-
ple breathless nights men lying sleepless
on stripped beds could hear in the still-
ness the moan of crocodiles and the deep
sighing of dugongs along the beach

  in spite of the incredible thing that had
occurred on the night of the dance salter
found himself haunting jans footsteps as
if he had been her dog watching her for
reasons quite other than those that still
seemed to move him professionally as
a government employee and an ex-cub
detective of sydney he was on the alert
for possible mischief as a man he
would have given up his very heart for
that mythical dog of jans to eat if she
had asked for it

  on an afternoon when the distant tops
of the mangrove forests lay like smoke-
blue clouds against the glass-blue sky
and the sea was cruel indigo and the
whole landscape alive with coming storm
seemed to sneer at the feeble insects who
ventured to call themselves masters of
its colossal solitudes-salter tramping
down the beach met suddenly with jan

she was dressed in a smock of scarlet
figured with daffodil that exactly re-
produced the flaming colors of the croton
avenues behind her she was as usual
barefoot and walking very quickly

  where are you going he asked her
he had had little converse with her late-
ly  when he met her she was either ab-
sent or hurried and not inclined to talk
this time he was determined to get an
answer out of her what was not he a
patrol officer of the finest service in the
world and wasnt she a potential crim-
inal imder observation that she or
kalipa meant a mischief either to perry
or perrys love he had never doubted
since the evening of the dance now near-
ly a week gone it was his duty to ob-
serve her he did it by quickening his
pace and walking beside her as she hur-
ried on he continued it by noticing the
extraordinary blackness and thickness of
her eyelashes the way they stood about
and shaded her gray eyes like rushes
standing round a mountain tarn

  she said in that deep curious voice of
hers a voice that somehow managed to
suggest that its owner had all the time
there was in the world to play with that
there was  hurry never would be any
hurry im not going anywhere
where have you been then 

  for a walk

  what are you doing

  nothing in her eyes he caught
a passing flicker of something like satis-
faction    he had seen a beautiful
snake basking on warm stone that flick-
ered its forked tongue in and out-just
like that-because it was happy

  the patrol officer clamped his hand
about the girls sun-coppered arm what
have you been up to he demanded

  now she met him full with her head
carried high on its brown-marble neck
no woman brought up from babyhood
among white folk had a neck a carriage
like januarys and her mouth curled
into a scornful smile

  policeman she said again with that
hint of scorn what business is it of
yours


it was kalipa fighting
madly with a furious tiger
snake-tame no more

  im not a policeman he hotly re-
plied im a government officer in con-
trol of native police and the rm and
i have to keep order what have you
been doing

  nothing government officer

  are you telling me lies

  the mission lady she told him
looking at him with eyes that said abso-
lutely nothing taught me that the good
book says all liars go to hell

  so- he said suddenly remembering
half-forgotten sunday-school experiences
so do dogs and-sorcerers

  and whoremongers and murderers
she calmly added i am january cook
im not a dog or a sorcerer and im a
good girl certainly i have never mur-
dered anyone	--
what about that foster-brother of
yours  hes the whole lot if i dont mis-
take what does he teach you when you
go away with him into the big bush
ive heard he keeps a sort of sorcerers
university out there well get him some
day and give him five years jail when
we catch him

    when you catch him she softly said
  now government officer i want to go
  home to my tea

    she said it so nicely-she was so well-
  behaved so entirely girlish and ordinary
  -that salter felt his head spinning round
  was this his potential criminal 

  one side of his mind coolly desired to
  rove that she was the other side was
  urning up with love irrational unwill-
  ing to listen jan-jan-is there a girl
  in all the world like you  there cant be
  there never will be again

    she was gone and he hadnt seen where
  she went home to tea maybe

  all the way to his house the two halves
  l of salters nature squabbled one
  side recalled cripps saying things will
  happen-just naturally the other side
  maintained that his nerves were tricking
  him he believed the girl when she said
  that she hadnt done any harm how
  long would that be true and how far
  was he fitted to judge of the case after
  what he thought hed seen the other
  night  had he been hypnotized  tem-
  
the blue book magazine

porarily mad witness of a conjuring
trick no whatever a piece of stick
might be made to do in the hands of a
clever conjurer even a conjurer couldnt
have made it get up and dance in the mid-
dle of the room all by itself and why
why

  he found himself thinking oddly-
that girl of perrys had missed something
with her appetite for strange things shed
have simply been thrilled that is if it
ever happened

  but a storm was brewing he had to
hurry home

after the storm the night was singu-
 larly calm stars hung like christ-
mas-tree fruit glittering among the
crotons and the mangoes and the palm-
tree tops all now alike in undistinguished
black stars made long silver stitches in
the quiet sea they didnt do that south
not large enough  so many things were
different in this strange papua even the
heavens were changed even love was not
the same a mountain torrent plunging
furiously to its destined end was not the
same as a full smooth river better
worse no telling but no doubt which
took you swiftest held you strongest

  salter half asleep on his camp stretch-
er was struck to wakefulness by a tap
on the side of the bed

  its me whispered the voice of
cripps dont shoot

  the officers hand stole back from the
roughened grip of the  that lay beside
his waist he sat up under his mosquito
net whats wrong cripps

  i dont know that anything is the
other whispered but januarys just
come back from the rms house-and
hes away tonight

  what salter was up and into his
shoes pajamas were clothing enough
he wanted to say what he thought of his
superior officer for leaving a white girl-
sister too-alone in a native country
but loyalty held him back are we all
mad he thought it isnt like cum-
mings

  cripps following he ran as silently as
he could toward the magistrates house
on the way taking a sudden turn he col-
lided violently with something that was
soft and warm and scented with frangi-
anni flowers-januarys favorite he
ung his arms about it whereve you
been wrhatve you been up to by
god january if youve been in mischief
ill clap the handcuffs on you if it breaks
my heart

  she stood quite still she laughed

  thora she said in her low lazy
voice thora will never marry him now
i think

  keep hold of the little hellion he
told cripps letting go stay there
january wasnt little and he didnt think
her a hellion but he was professional in
that moment    there was the house
there was the window of the spare room
-the big spare room that he knew with
its handsome furniture and huge walnut
bed no light inside no sound or
was there didnt he hear something
like the rolling out of pastry on a hard
board a queer faintly rumbling noise
that he couldnt at all account for thora
was certainly there and certainly not
dead whatever had happened he could
hear her breathing-and even in that mo-
ment he was vaguely conscious of a
pricking disappointment lord how the
girl snored

  leaning through the window he
snapped on his torch the rolling sound
had stopped had given way to a tapping
noise vaguely reminiscent where had
he heard that before

  thora was awake sitting up in an
extremely ornate sleeping-outfit she
stared at him-and made snorting pig-
like noises surely he must be mad-
or she

  then he saw and thora saw and
screamed and the piglike noises con-
tinued through the scream

  he saw that the hellish bamboo was
there dancing in the middle of the floor
he made a wild leap into the room at it
-whatever it was he was going to know
this time but he missed it-and came
into sharp contact with a mans fair ruf-
fled head perrys

the snoring had ceased perry was
wide awake he seized the bamboo
in his hand and pitched it out of the
window someone outside apparently
did not dodge it there was a smashing
cracking sound and a yell

  salter was out again through the win-
dow first this lime the light of his
torch fell on someone who as he instant-
ly horrifiedly saw would not long need
either punishment or hell kalipa kali-
pa fighting madly with a furious tiger
snake that wreathed with the fragments
of the bamboo in which it had been im-
prisoned was hanging with deadly fangs
on to his neck

  they could see that he was wildly en-
deavoring to regain control of the crea-
january girl

ture which no doubt had been one of his
trained familiars-but even a trained
snake will revolt if its prison is violent-
ly smashed on someones person and
the tiger snake was tame no more perry
and salter together struck at the writh-
ing body that shone tortoiseshell and am-
ber and jetty black in the light of the
torch it fell to the ground kalipa still
calling and addressing it as if it could
hear salter seized a stick and killed it
perry neglecting the snake turned his
attention to kalipa who had fallen on
the ground and was panting for breath
in no more than a couple of minutes his
eyes turned up he flung his arms out once
and lay still

  got him in a vein no chance the
planter said letting the dead hand fall
thora thora darling dont be fright-
ened its all right

  thora was not frightened she was
shocked she leaned out of the window
ignoring both the corpse of the man and
the body of the snake the light of sal-
ters torch shone on her left hand it
bore a ring i-i-we were married
yesterday my brother knew she said
explanatorily holding her hand a little
farther toward the light

  good night said salter and left
them to summon a couple of constables
and have the body carried away thora
didnt know the chap was dead he sup-
posed or else she didnt care a native
was a native to her

  but if perry bushman quick mover
sturdy fellow hadnt been there-if she
had awakened in the pale dawn and seen
that mysterious carved bamboo rolling
and dancing on the floor simple enough
when you understood it wasnt it as
simple as time and death why shed
have picked it up being what she was
avidly curious shed have opened it
and then-two yards of glittering fury
and a dead girl on the floor there is
no poison worse than that of the tiger
snake in the hot days and nights of the
new year

  jan had dropped it in jan had had
it in her own room-how long she had
got it and the knowledge to use it from
her foster-brother the sorcerer who lay
dead and as cripps had told him the
thing would have happened just as things
happen-naturally

dawn had begun to light the croton
trees to flame when salter reached
the spot where cripps was waiting with
jan-the girls wrists and ankles tied

up with bush rope it might have been
the faint chill that goes with coming day
or it might have been the sickness that
overcame him when he thought of what
jan had done but salter was shivering
a little as he loosed her bonds briefly
he told cripps what had occurred shell
come quietly he said you go home
and cripps went

jan was quiet what do you want
me for she said her eyes looked
straight into his and for the first time
-torture-he saw in them that which he
had desired to see

  for attempted murder was his curt
reply

  jan said quietly but stressing each
word i shall not ever go to hell i am
not a liar or a sorcerer or a dog or
a whoremonger-i do not know what
that is but i am not it and not a mur-
derer

  who is then

  kalipa when i told him i could not
do it and gave him back the bamboo he
threw me away and cursed me and he
said the girl has hurt you my sister
of the breast and she shall pay hurting
you she has hurt all my tribe he said
that in our language and he frightened
me so that i couldnt move but at last
i ran and ran and then when i met
cripps i said she will not marry him-
because i thought i wouldnt be in time-
but i was coming-to you

  you were

  may the crocodiles tear my head from
my body if i was not

  he said i believe you but i shall
look at all the footsteps when it grows
lighter and then-

  then youll believe me more

  i couldnt he said and suddenly took
her in his arms standing there breath-
less she yet found breath to say she
has taken him and me i do not want
anothers bread id rather starve
you shant starve he said-and he

kissed her to silence

  a little while after when perry had
sold his plantation and sailed away
south and the service had lost a good
man in salter who had bought perrys
plantation and gone up-river to live
cripps sitting in his doorway remarked
to his dog nipper an upside-down
place and always was but it takes a
hold of you somehow nipper doesnt
it

  nipper who wanted his supper faint-
ly whined
to see the grand exploits of my
great-uncle elmer as they were
as they cut their sure swift mark
through the rich and solid earth
is difficult today-for time is after all
a harsh rust or a bright polish upon the
iron plowshare of actuality my mem-
ory of uncle elmer is of a bearded old
man once big but now shrunken as if he
had been too long in the wind and sun
who sat in the creaking rocker by the win-
dow and gazed out through the notch of
the hills to the plain beyond always to
the northward-a shrunken big old man
who spun to me tales of mighty deeds
and sewed up the ends with petulant plat-
itudes i could not see him then as the
one whose great doings once had been the
talk of southern michigan but i know
now that what has happened to a man is
however deeply buried forever a part of
him scraping the rust or the polish
away i must then have found somewhere
in the core of that old man the giant of
legend i must even have found the el-
mer scofield who  that dark night of
his twenty-first birthday founded a fact
and improved upon a superstition   

  as the sun was sliding over the ridge
to the east on that december day elmer
looked upon his world of field and wood-
land and found it good a quarter-sec-
tion of ich land was his fathers farm



with sixty acres thanks mainly to elmers
prodigious efforts cleared and tillable
the wheat was sold and the log barn filled
with hay for sheep and cattle so far
the winter had been mild and the stock
still found some pasture by the icy spring
there were  more hostile indians and
a few friendly ones michigan was now
a full-fledged state-astate of lakes and
rolling hills deep forests and some cleared
land and elmer scofield though he had
never quite told himself so was indubit-
ably the strongest man in michigan

  yes to elmer breathing deeply of the
frosty air and seeing the red rising sun
it was plain enough that a good whig who
walked in the ways of the lord and
feared not to use his own strength might
gain a reasonable profit and aside from
that it was his twenty-first birthday and
for a long time he had had a thing in
mind to do that day down at eben
hawkins little store at pinnebog there
were an inner and an outer circle away
from the fire the fledglings sat or scuffled
among themselves or whatever but close
to the warm blaze on boxes and barrels
and such as came to hand you would find
the grown men tapping the hard cider
from eben hawkins hogshead talking
politics and religion and always con-
scious of their prerogative let a stripling
try to enter the circle and he was quickly

 when he was ten years old he tackled a
 lynx with his hare hands but when he
 was a man and a big one a wolf gave him
 another kind of argument  a legend
 of early days in michigan by the author
 of the great man

uncle cl

and the
alonzo cain said
elmer i expect
youre just about the
strongest man that
ever lived

shooed away and put in his place but
lately elmer had been reading consider-
able in the bible and had mastered a
good bit of american history too as well
as the collected works of lord byron
since these held enough knowledge for
any honest man elmer had been planning
for some weeks that on this day he would
invade that inner circle

  he took a final look at the sky and saw
only a few faint clouds to the west he
stepped inside the kitchen and came out
again with his smoothbore in his hand

  now where are you going elmer
said a monotonous voice

  elmer felt something sink in his chest
he turned slowly that porch on the log
section of the house-what was itfjw the
east wing-had been vacant only a mo-
ment before but now as he might have
known it would be it was occupied by
the limp petulant form of joseph scofield

  why pa said elmer its my birth-
day and i thought it a fair time to go to
town for a spell of talk with the boys



talk talk indeed said joseph sco-
field youd waste the lords own time
in chatter with a parcel of locofoco ninny-
hammers while your own flesh and blood
is brought to ruin

  elmer might have known it would be
like this he might have known that his
father would manage to slip out of bed
and get there in his favorite sitting-place
before he could get away that log sec-
tion had been the original scofield cabin
but elmer had added a two-story brick
and stone piece making the main part of
the house it was a part of the elder sco-
fields defeatist philosophy that he dis-
regarded this new section as mere frip-
pery or as a result of dealings with the
devil though the new part was warmer
in winter and cooler in summer he con-
tinued to live in the log wing

jpa said elmer confident at least
i that he had milked the cows fault-
lessly whats the matter now
elmer scofield said his father shak-
ing his head things wasnt like this
when i was a boy how can you stand
there and ask foolish questions when you
know theres a storm coming and prac-
tically no wood cut to see it through
elmer tossed joseph scofield up
onto the roof of the porch pa
he said im going to plnnebog

   elmer tried to keep his temper you
 know as well as i do he said that
 theres twenty cord of wood piled behind
 the house and i dont see no sign of a
 storm what in tarnations the matter
 joseph scofield settled down a little
 farther into his gloom matter  with
 william henry harrison dead-and a
 virtual democrat in the white house
 with the country going to the dogs and
 the crops bad no money coming in for
 another year and maybe never with
 that varmint peterhouse living right next
 door and on top of that that con-
 founded wolf has et up four more sheep

 elmer saw his hopes of pinnebog fad-
 ing pa he said staying home on
 my birthday aint going to get john tyler
 out of the white house nor myron peter-
 house off the next farm as byron said-
 you dont know joseph scofield
 droned on how your mother and me
 have suffered it seems as if the lord
 would know and cease to visit further
 punishment upon us but no hes gone
 and given us a thankless lout for a son
 elmer why dont you get that wolf
 elmer squirmed that timber wolf
 and its spawn were probably just about
 the last left in southern michigan and
 also the smartest the lord knew he
 had tried to get it and he didnt like to
 be reminded of his failure it made him
 mad all through

   he laid down his gun generally he
 was a dutiful son but now he picked up
 joseph scofield by the slack of his trou-
 sers and tossed him reasonably gently
 up onto the roof of the porch

   pa he said im going to pinnebog

   it was saturday and a good many peo-
 ple were sitting around eben hawkins
 store many of them spoke to elmer as
 he came in and he answered without real-
 ly looking at them he had nerved him-
 self up on the way in and his mind and
 his eye-were on the fireplace where heaped-
 up tamarack logs were blazing and sput-
 tering on that and the circle of men
 around it and eben hawkins hogshead
 of hard cider

   elmer walked straight to the circle he
 spotted a big box filled with hardware
 and pulled it over and sat down for
 a- moment nobody spoke a word and el-
 mers heart was pounding

   hank bingham broke the dead silence
 you folks ever hear he said how el-
 mer killed a lynx with his bare hands
 when he was only ten years old

   elmer reddened with embarrassment
 shucks it wasnt anything he said

   somebody passed him a tin cup full of
 hard cider he gulped it down  in his em-
 barrassment he bent the cup into a wad
 of tin then hastened to straighten it out
 before anyone should notice

   i dont know about that said alonzo
 cain but i do know that the other day
 elmer cut ten cord of wood between sun-
 rise and sunset cut it and corded it
 saw it with my own eyes

   lordy me observed hank bingham
 why id think to be doing right well if
 i cut three

   elmer blushed and gulped more cider
 it wasnt any real trouble he insisted
why the other day
peterhouse got kben
so twisted up that lie
was talking for the
democrats

illustrated

by

lyle justis

  folks in those days liked a good well-
rounded yarn and elmer made a good
subject from that minute on tales of
his great doings sprang up like puffballs
from all corners of the room it must
have gone on that way for half an hour

  finally alonzo cain said elmer i
expect youre just about the strongest
man that ever lived

  elmer got red and warm all over again
not really thinking he reached over and
picked up the hogshead of cider and
poured the contents down his throat out
of the bunghole then he was able to
speak

  well he said i guess samson was
awful strong

  youd think spoke up a dry voice
from over in the dimness across the fire
that a man as mighty as elmerd know
what to do with myron peterhouse

well there it was and he might
have expected it elmer could feel
the pride and joy ooze away from along
his veins and out of him he turned and
peered past the fire but he knew already
that it was bayne henshaw who had
spoken there was some intent of humor
in baynes remark but considerable of
vinegar too for after all bayne hen-
shaw favored elmer scofield in size but
couldnt hold a candle to him when it
came to strength and bayne could not
very well forget that

  it would be a comforting thing if he
did hank bingham admitted but i

expect elmer living right neighbor to
him knows that as well as we do
elmer kind of winced and couldnt
seem to feel that half a hogshead of cider
at all why myron peterhouse had had
to pick that particular quarter-section of
land that touched on the scofields no-
body would ever know but he had be-
come the cross they had to bear he did
not keep the rail fence in repair he let
his stock stray into the scofield grain-
fields and elmers father held a strong
suspicion that once he had butchered a
scofield heifer but all these things were
as nothing beside the one most damn-
ing fact of all myron peterhouse was
a democrat this was the thing that
made joseph scofield feel unclean and
lose sleep of nights if he had once asked
peterhouse to sell his land to him and
at a good fat price too he had asked him
a dozen times-but peterhouse was that
mean and cantankerous he wouldnt even
accommodate a neighbor

  the trouble is said alonzo cain
myron peterhouse is scienced its like
in boxing where sometimes a small man
can plain lick the tar out of a big one
now peterhouse hes scienced in talk
he can talk rings around anybody in this
whole county-maybe the whole state
why the other day he got eben here so
twisted up that he was talking for the
democrats

  eben hawkins grunted i wouldnt
say that-i wouldnt say that but peter-
house is awful shrewd and his ways of
you folks ever hear
how elmer killed a
lynx with his bare
hands when he was
only ten years old

argument aint decent you cant do him
in with talk you got to figure a smarter
way around

  that was the trouble with myron pet-
erhouse in a nutshell the time was be-
fore he came to those parts when a man
could come into the store or go to a barn-
raising for that matter and know he was
among good whigs and methodists and
sit and talk and feel himself at ease he
didnt have to worry about thinking of
things to say or answering arguments
he could use the old and comfortable
things that had already been said now
here was myron peterhouse a democrat
and folks suspected godless too and with
his smart and dangerous talk it gave a
man no peace at all

  well they went on talking about pet-
erhouse and what a terror he was and
how he had done this and that and the
country would be well rid of him and
most likely everybody but elmer for-
got that bayne henshaw had kind of put
it up to him to handle peterhouse el-
mer couldnt forget it and thinking
about it made it plain to him what a fail-
ure and a weakling he really was here
was the meanest manin the county ac-
cording to the best opinion up to all sorts
of bad business and living not a hundred
rods from elmer scofield the strongest
man in the county and a right-living
whig yet in all these years elmer



hadnt been able to trouble myron peter-
house enough so that he would even sell
out at a good price

  the more they talked without saying
a word against elmer the more he got to
thinking that maybe he had been a little
previous in getting himself into the inner
circle around the fire he kept edging
back that boxful of cast-iron pumps he
was sitting on six inches or a foot at a
time till he was just about back among
the boys again and seeing that he felt
sorry for himself who had had his birth-
day spoiled and sorry for the county

  and about that time that half-hogs-
head of hard cider maybe because of the
dammed-up tears it was mixing with now
must have risen right up and hit elmer
hard at any rate he came to his feet
so quick and hard that pans rattled on
the shelves and the fire went whoosh and
puffed out smoke

  by tarnation said elmer with a sob
in his voice ill settle with myron pe-
terhouse  

  before anyone could speak or move he
was through the door and out he didnt
mean to slam that door but he was
mighty determined the beam above it
settled a full two inches and that was
a fact

  they say that as soon as eben haw-
kins got to his feet having fallen to the
floor at the impact he ran to the door and
forced it open and called to elmer not to
be hasty that hed better come back and
talk it over even bayne henshaw they
say called out to elmer and told him not
to take it so hard but elmer did not
turn back and he may not even have
heard the call his brain was befogged
and besides a heavy snow was falling
he knew that when he got home his
father would remind him that he had pre-
dicted snow and that would be only the
beginning there would be more about
crops and the wood and the wolf and
the state of the nation elmers deter-
mination of a moment before was weak-
ened by these thoughts and it mixed him
up something terrible if william henry
harrison himself had called out to him
he wouldnt have turned back

  sometime later though when he was
nearing home he heard footsteps behind
him these were very soft but coming
closer he turned around

i there not thirty feet away stood the
biggest gray wolf he had ever seen

 elmer made as if to raise his gun and
fire

  no said the wolf you havent got
any gun you left it back in the store

  for a moment it seemed to elmer as
if he had heard a wolf talking to him
just as plain as day-and talking more-

over in the voice of myron peterhouse
then things kind of fogged over again
and the main thing he remembered was
that he had forgotten his gun and it was
a crying shame because here was that
confounded wolf out of the corners of
his eyes he could see other gray shapes
slinking in  still he wasnt really afraid
with a bellow he leaped toward the big
wolf it skittered away

  come back here you varmint
shouted elmer come back and fight
like a man

  the wolf sat down on its haunches
fighting it said is the typical re-
course of the ignorant what do you
think a fight would really gain either of
us 

  elmer made an angry leap for him
the wolf danced nimbly away on its
toes just out of reach of elmers ham-
sized hands

  you git out of here you son of satan
shouted elmer this woods belongs to
my pa 

  stop that pious noise and be sensible
said the wolf cant you see by now
that you cant ever catch me come
now calm down and come along home
with me and talk this thing over

  at first that suggestion just took el-
mers breath away then when he got it
back he exploded all over again but it
was what he finally agreed to do he
sensed a trick and he was nervous about
it but he guessed he could play along
with the trickiest of them when it came
to that

they started through the woods side
by side the wolfs four companions
-three of them cubs near to full-grown-
came up from behind to join them the
gray sun had set above the leaves of
the oaks and the pine boughs were thick
between them and the sky and every-
where in here except close to the white
ground it was very dark off to the
right above the crunch of his own foot-
steps elmer heard the burble of a famil-
iar waterfall he remembered sitting
there by the creek just above the falls
with his toes in the water on a sunny day
in late spring that seemed a long time
ago though it had been only a year or
two he felt now that being a man
grown wasnt as fine as he had imagined
it to be

  well he was as pious and god-fearing
as the next man he guessed and when
in the good graces of the lord he ought
to be a match for old beelzebub himself
  they came after considerable of a
walk to a large opening in a rocky hill-
side elmer did not recognize this cave
but he could place it as being somewhere
on the north slope of a ridge called after
the last democratic president van bur
ens hill a fitting place he thought to
harbor a wolf

 here we are said the wolf wont
you step inside 

  elmer hesitated a moment thinking
he ought to let the wolf go first then
he discarded the notion as cowardice and
went clumping in trampling down with
his great boots such shrubs as were still
alive before the entrance the wolf and
his family came after softly and easily on
their toes as is the fashion of such beasts

   elmer found though that as he went
ahead the cave got lower and lower and
darker and darker finally he stopped

   just a little farther said the wolf

  elmer took another step and bumped
his head on a rock overhead so the var-
mint wanted him whittled down to its own
size did it he whirled around

   not for man or beast sir he said
i have never gone down  my knees
save before my maker and i dont in-
tend to do so now youre trying to
trick me you know mighty well ive
got the strength of ten men and youre
trying to fix things so itll do me no
good

  the wolf gave a dry little chuckle

vis consili expers mole ruit sua said
he and the words sounded like the slap-
ping of old leather

  what  inquired elmer suspiciously
hows that

  i repeated answered the wolf with a
mischievous grin what was said some-
time ago by a roman poet-that brute
strength bereft of reason falls of its own
weight by which i meant that youre
near to a man grown now elmer and
being already as strong as need be youd
best look to your learning he added
sort of wistfully it might give a fellow
somebody to talk to

  now look here said elmer full of
strength and hard cider and honest indig-
nation theres nothing wrong with my
wits nor learning i may not know the
heathen verses you have learned but i
do know my scriptures and i know
enough to be a good whig and no petti-
fogging democrat

  ah elmer chuckled the wolf and
can you tell me why you are a whig and
no pettifogging democrat 	

  why-why thats plain to see an-
swered elmer could i favor slavery
could i favor a party that refuses to pro-
tect its infant industries by a just tariff
ah said the wolf and were slavery
and the tariff mentioned in the platform
of your last whig convention is that
what your party stands for 	

  why why- elmer stammered color-
ing up

  it seems to me said the wolf that
in the last campaign thjit your party con-
f liner said the wolf
can yon tell me why

you are a whig

ducted so successfully a great deal was
said about the virtues of log cabins-
your candidate one william henry har-
rison never having lived in one-and as
much said and done about the virtues of
hard cider in which your candidate had
never indulged qf a platform i remem-
ber nothing of any mention of slavery
or a high tariff to protect our infant in-
dustries t recall not a word

  no matter came back elmer des-
perately  twasall implied if it wasnt
written

  ah was the wolfs answer so your
whigs make a platform by implications
and win their campaign with brass bands
and free cider of such is the salvation
of our republic

well that was only the beginning
of it for two hours the taik went
on with elmer getting into deeper and
deeper water all the time he tried to
escape from politics by getting off onto
byron but even there the wolf tracked
him down and outquoled him finally
the wolf sort of settled himself back and
said in a voice almost kindly

  my boy its lime you gave up your
strength is as the strength of ten but your
logics at sixes and sevens

  well sir elmer looked down at him
from way up there by the roof of the cave
and the pores of his body were dammed
with rage sir he said with his voice
breaking your wit is inspired by satan
ill hear no more

  he turned and started toward the en-
trance the wolf came right aftef- him

  now elmer he said theres no call
to be going off half-cocked like that i
didnt aim to make you mad i was en-
joying our little argument come and
sit a spell and let s talk some more
why we havent even started yet on the
question of whose land this is and which
of us has got the most right to be here

  the wolf looked so unhappy and down-
right disappointed that elmer calmed a
mite and turned back but he was go-
ing to be firm just the same

  theres  question there he said
its our land we got -it from the gov-
ernment youve got to get out

  now youre talking said the wolf
but from whom did the government get
this land 

  you cant mix me up  that growled
elmer they bought it from the in-
juns

  stole the wolf corrected stole not
bought is the word but the fact is it
wasnt ever settled in the first place
whether the indians or the wolves owned
it even if your government bought it
its doubtful if it recompensed the proper
parties

  now look here said elmer the
smartest wolf in the world cant prove to
me thathe could own title to land tri-
umphantly if figuratively he whisked the
scofield family bible from the dark waste
of the parlor table man if you read
your scriptures was given dominion over
the birds of the heavens and every living
thing that moveth upon this earth
dominion repeated the wolf it
means strictly rule sovereignty control
but even i that whole passage wasnt in-
vented by man himself in the present
democratic denotation of the word domin-
ion t dont see anything to justify your
driving us from our homes and our means
of livelihood

not quite so confidently elmer said
you cant stop the wheels of progress
is it progress said the wolf or is
it just a new way of enslaving your-
selves 

  elmer thought that over for a min-
ute then he remembered his american
history youre seeing here the taming
of a continent he quoted man sweeps
westward toward the setting sun where
he walks beasts and heathen savages
have got to make way for him thats
plain destiny

  the wolf made a sound very much like
a snort

  jvi understand he said that all the
way eastward to the ocean stout for-
ests are tumbling and you men of des-
tiny are ripping up the fine green ground
that was good beneath the feet when
thats done you put up factories that
belch smoke and taint the air you breathe
so you can toil in them to make ma-
chinery to make life easier then you
have to build more factories to make the
machines to make the machinery be-
fore youre through youre working for
the factories not they for you and you
cant any longer roam free in the forests
like every other living thing is that
what you call fulfilling destiny

  well- said elmer well i expect
its the christian way to live if it wasnt
right that christian folk should build
factories and make progress then the
good lord wouldnt have given them the
brains to do it

that said the wolf is about as
 bad a piece of rationalization as i
could hope to hear justifying the right-
ness of the fact by its existence elmer
scofield you know very well that you
dont really believe that yourself
elmer looked sheepish no he said
i expect youre right i guess that-
there right on the edge of agreeing
elmer stopped maybe it was the agree-
ing that got him it was one thing to be
licked in an argument but something a
lot different and worse to start admitting
you were wrong

    it could have been that or it could
  have been just a trick of light so that
  looking into the wolfs eyes he seemed
  all at once to see the sharp eyes of myron
  peterhouse anyhow right at that mo-
  ment like a dash of cold snow down his
  neck it came to him where he was and
  what he had been doing hed been talk-
  ing to a wolf and letting that wolf argue
  him into agreement why he must be
  bewitched 

     elmer took no stock in such things he
  believed only in what you could touch
  and explain and put a name to just the
  same he was scared he was scared half
  out of his boots and his teeth were chat-
  tering he didnt dare to turn his back
  and run but he had to do something
  mightyfast

    then he remembered hank bingham
  had told him that thething to do when
  you were bewitched was to repeat the
  names of the twelve apostles he opened
  his mouth and began matthew mark
  luke-

     the queer thing was though that those
  werent the words that came out maybe
  it was his teeth chattering or maybe it
  was too much american history for the
  sounds he heard were

   george washington-john adams-
  thomas jefferson-james madison-
  he was naming the presidents of the
  united states and he went right through
  to william henry harrison without stop-
  ping for some reason he skipped john
  tyler but he couldnt stop himself now
  he went right back to george washington
  and started over again only faster this
  time

    with the second george washing-
  ton i  a great rock dislodged itself from
  the roof of the cave and clattered down
  with the second john adams  another
  one fell it just missed one of the wolf
  
 cubs and the cub yelped and cowered
 back farther into the cave

   with the democratic presidents noth-
 ing happened except for john quincy
 adams when a small stone fell maybe
 because he was more or less of a fed-
 eralist at one time but with the sec-
 ond william henry harrison  the
 whole floor heaved up the she-wolf and
 all the young ones had run far back into
 the cave now and only the leader was
 left

  the thing had got out of hand el-
 mer could see the entire cave collapsing
 around him but he couldnt help himself
 he went right on

  finally when he reached the thirteenth
 john quincy adams the gray wolf
 came forward and lifted his paw

   stop  he said e pluribus unum
 si quarts peninsularn anoenam circum-
 spice in the name of the united states
 of america stop

   either the charm was gone or elmer
 was all out of breath he stopped

   when we came here said the wolf
 sounding very tired i thought we could
 discuss our differences like gentlemen in
 a logical fashion i was wrong you
 cant settle disputes amicably with clod-
 polls and dunderpates when theyre
 out-talked they always get angry and re-
 sort to force

  if you were the only one i might stay
 on and fight it out but youre not i
 can see it happening these fine woods
 filling with men like you who are more
 ox than man with psalm-singing puri-
 tans and pious dollar-chasers in five
 years time the quoting of horace will be
 a lost art in these parts and a man want-
 ing a good talk on logic will have to talk
 to himself in whats left of the woods

the shining moun-
tains another un-
usual story by chand-
ler whipple will ap-
pear in an early issue

   the wolf shook his head no sir id
 be lonely here you can have your
 woods im going north get out now
 and leave us in peace you have my word
 that by morning well be gone for good

   elmer went he felt very quiet with-
 in himself maybe a little ashamed as he
 pushed aside the walls of the tumbled
 cave and stepped out into the white of the
 falling snow he did not look back

 well you can take that or leave it
 alone now and then uncle elmer
 was vague about that night and now
 and then he wasnt but of one thing
 that happened then there is no doubt
 sometime toward morning myron peter-
 house tramped through the darkness and
 the deepening snow to the scofield house
 and there disposed of his farm and goods
 lock stock and barrel to joseph sco-
 field for the sum of six hundred and
 twenty-five dollars then myron peter-
 house walked out into the night and
 neither he nor his wife nor his children
 were ever seen again

   and as uncle elmer always said after
 that night no wolf was ever seen again
 in that part of michigan and for a long
 time mighty few democrats but as he
 said it to me those many years later he
 would be peering out the window to the
 northward-and it seemed sometimes that
 he peered nervously as if expecting that
 at any moment from the wooded plain
 beyond the notch of the hills myron pet-
 erhouse or the wolf might appear com-
 ing to take him too off to that sturdy land
 of legend into which they had so long
 since gone

when clod-polls
and dunderpa t es
are out-talked
they always gei
angry and resort

the story thus far

othing ever happens down
here in panama growled
ted to shep reeves his part-
ner on a banana plantation
it aint what happens said shep wise-
ly its what might happen that counts
youll feel better when we steam for
colon on leave

  shep was right for in colon the fruit-
company manager asked them to under-
take a job of intelligence work on behalf
of the government as well as the fruit
company though neither would acknowl-
edge it-or help them out if they got
into trouble for foreign agents presum-
ably nazi were developing banana plan-
tations in the neighboring country of
parador and there was strong evidence
that their investment was more po-
litical than commercial ted and shep
were to pose as entomologists making
museum collections and find out just
what was happening in parador

pafmfrlrrkf	htf	i

  they found out though there was a
delay while ted recovered from a fever
in the hospital-a delay prolonged a bit
because ted fell in love with his pretty
american nurse martha evans she too
came to be interested in parador which
ted had talked about in his delirium
for her next patient was wealthy old don
miguel ferrara a leader of the anti-gov-
ernment faction in parador and when
thanks to insulin he got on his feet again
he engaged her to instruct those who
were to care for him on his big hacienda

  soon after ted and shep arrived on
their mission in parador a german
named reiser questioned them all too
curiously about their bug-hunting activi-
ties and one evening soon afterward as
they were sitting in a little rural tavern
a fight started and the lights went out
when they came on again the police had
arrived-and ted was arrested for the
murder of a man who lay dead on the

floor obviously framed ted and
shep presently found themselves in a
chain-gang working on the roads   

  so it happened that martha evans
driving up a mountain road with don
miguel and his parjy was horrified to
recognize a tattoo mark on the bare
shoulder of a convict in a road-wjing
the story continues in detail

the men who had worked on the roads
all day came back at night to a com-
pound surrounded by a crude stockade
there they ate their evening meal of oily
rice with gobbets of meat in it then sat

for a while around little fires while they
warmed their stiffened muscles sang
gambled and talked

  ted stretched out his feet to the fire
took off the remains of his shoes and cau-
tiously unwound the rags with which he
had replaced his wornout socks

  but i saw her he said i tell you
i saw her as plainly as i see you she
was riding in the car with that old don
they talk so much about

  youre dreaming answered shep i
know how it is ive had it myself but
dont let it get you what in hell would
martha be doing here 

jjdcappen

two men from the united states undertake
a job of intelligence work in south america
-and are framed by a nasi agent

by f draco
the blue book magazine

  he was in the panama hospital she
could have come down to nurse him
couldnt she

  mighty unlikely you may have seen
a blonde but all blondes arent martha
not by a damn sight

  ted sighed it was useless to argue
with shep when he wanted to be contra-
dictory better change the subject

  to think just to think he groaned
that i found riobar boring

  shep hid his grin behind his new griz-
zled beard he pulled together over his
chest what was left of a green silk shirt
and stretched himself out with his back
to the fire he had an animals capacity
for making himself comfortable any-
where weeks of hard labor lean diet
and forced abstinence from liquor had
removed his paunch and the sun had
burned the pearly luster out of his skin
what remained was a stocky brown fig-
ure built for power and endurance rather
than speed wide and close to the ground

  some folks he drawled cant be
satisfied i did all right in riobar and
im doing all right here i feel pretty
healthy and im still alive wtiat more
do you ask 

  ted looked at him with envy since
they had been in the camp he had earn-
estly and vainly tried to imitate sheps
acceptance of life as it came he could
numb himself with work so that he did
not think at all but he could not achieve
any reasoned calm about his confinement

  a paradorian came over and joined
them holding out a couple of cigarettes
these norte-americanos were popular
for they joked a lot never tried to put
their work off on anybody else never in-
formed and were generally good-natured
their comrades-murderers thieves and
political prisoners - appreciated these
qualities ted accepted a cigarette and
led off with the infallible formula for
conversation

  hows the revolution pepe 

  no good answered pepe in the little
english which he had picked up from
them then relapsing into rapid span-
ish they are vultures vampire bats
bloodsuckers they fatten on the blood
of the people the sons of swine

shep opened one eye somebody you
dont like

  which side asked ted just to keep
it going

  the conservistas of course the ones
who are trying to get in to destroy the
first reforms my country has had in

twenty years to bleed the people until
they cannot fight for themselves to sell
us to the foreigners pepe spat expres-
sively into the fire

  ted began to take more interest you
mean there really is going to be a revolu-
tion 

  but of course everyone knows that
it comes soon i think

  are you for the government

  i pepe drew himself up proudly
i am for no government me im an
anarchist

  ted had not quite learned not to try
tying the latin mind down to anglo-sax-
on ideas why do you care then

pepe tossed back the thick shock of
coarse black hair which showed how
strongly indian and how little spanish
his ancestors had been his deep-set
black eyes glittered fanatically his
round head bobbed with excitement on
a neck too thin for it as he grasped at a
chance to make a speech like the ones
which had delighted the laborers in the
cantina of his native village in the fire-
light his heavy features took on a certain
nobility and even sweetness

  governments he announced they
are all bad always the politicians rob
the people and give them promises for
payment the ones who are in change
places with the ones who are out and the
people pay some day there will be no
more government and then the people
can live that is for tomorrow that is
for when all the tyrants have killed each
other off

  meanwhile this present government
is better than most it gives us roads
and schools and they are what we need
in parador myself i am glad to work
on the roads that is serving my coun-
try it is right i am here i get very
drunk one night and hit my friend with
a machete luckily i am very drunk and
my foot slips so i do not kill him but
his neck gets twisted over to one side like
so and he will always look very funny
i am lucky it is no worse

  no comrades this government is not
bad the one that is coming will be
much worse that will be the landown-
ers the big fellows who would squash a
man the way i would squash that beetle
who will sell us to the foreigners and
commit any crime to line their own filthy
pockets and at the head and front of
them is that prince of satan who reeks
of stolen gold and the blood of his coun-
trymen that robber don miguel ferrara
anything might happen

  him i know my father has worked
and lived always on his land and my
grandfather before him and who knows
how many before that if i can get out
in time i will kill him but who knows
whether i get out

  ted began to feel an unexpected inter-
est in pepes political theories

  but look here pepe he said you
are talking as if this revolution were sure
to succeed who is going to fight for this
ferrara if he is as bad as you say
pepe spat again into the fire and
rubbed his thumb and forefinger together
expressively

  there is always money if you keep
people poor enough so that their bellies
always ache a little they will sell their
souls for a little money to put some com-
fort in their stomachs my people are
easily led the revolution will succeed
and it will be bad very bad there will
be blood on the soil of parador until all
the leaders die

  nothing baffled ted more in the para-
dorian character than the satisfaction
with which they resigned themselves to
the worst since he did not know any
more questions he fell to staring into the
fire as pepe did then he noticed that
one of the guards had left the table by
the compound gate where by the light of
a flashlight they were playing cards and
slapping insects and was strolling toward
them the guards could be distinguished
from the prisoners by their revolvers and
by the fact that they had better boots

  here comes trouble ted said may-
be youve been talking too much

  for nothing pepe answered they
shoot you as soon as a pig if you run
but they are too lazy to bother about
talking

as soon as the guard was near enough
 to make his voice carry he con-
served energy by shouting

  you pepe huertez heres a visitor for
you a guy with his head on his own
shoulder

 pepe beamed excuse me my com-
rades he said with the courtesy which
a paradorian uses even toward a man
he intends to murder it is my best
friend the man i had the fight with
he is one good friend i tell you he
comes very often to see me

  pepe went off happily and ted sat si-
lent for a moment then pounded with his
fists on his knees

  im going crazy doing nothing we
ought to get out of here and warn the

company i want to check on this fer-
rara guy too

  let them fight it out shep answered
well be ok if we dont choose sides
until we see who is going to win

  ted made no answer he had not lost
enough faith in life to be able to accept
sheps cynicism yet under the circum-
stances he could not find much with
which to combat it he went on adjust-
ing the rags around his feet and silence
reigned

it was interrupted by the return of pepe
but a pepe in a very different mood
his eyes had almost vanished under his
heavy brows he appeared violently agi-
tated and his long stringy arms jerked
about like a puppet on wires

  my mother and my father  he said
over and over and then with a string of
maledictions consigned don miguel fer-
rara to the lowest hole in hell he shook
his fists at the sky and shouted until
foam gathered on his lips then flung him-
self full length on the ground and buried
his face on his arms shep sat up and
looked at him curiously and ted put a
hand on his shoulder

  what is it hombre tell us about
it

  when pepes sobs had subsided enough
to allow him to speak he sat up again

  it is as i told you he is a devil in-
carnate with no more heart than the devil
has my father and my mother have
lived always on his land now they are
old and my father is blind last week
his agent comes and turns them out of
their little house where are we to go 
they ask are we foxes that can hide in
a burrow how am i to know says
the man let us see the patrdn they
beg the patrdn is busy says the man
busy all the countryside knows how
he is busy with that new american toy
of his that meesevan 

  shep was in time to catch teds arm as
it came up and to ask did you say miss
evans

  some such a name she comes with
him from panama they say she is beau-
tiful

  ted tried to shake off sheps hand

  dont be a fool said shep in eng-
lish how will you find out what you
want to know if you choke off the source
of information  pepe doesnt mean any
harm you cant expect these guys to
understand a trained nurse if she isnt
dressed like a nun shut up

  pepe went on absorbed in his story


t must kill that son
or a swine before he
does more harm

  now they have gone those sick old
people to a cave in the mountains how
shall they live there  there is no food for
them it is too much i must get out
of here i must help them and i must
kill that son of a swine before he does
more harm

     if you can get out i can too said
  ted grimly ill give you all the help
   can now and later

     pepe held out his hand and ted took it
     you are my brother said pepe

  in the nights that followed the three
  men talked over plan after plan but
  could find none that offered a chance of
  success it would not be hard to get away
  from the careless guards even in the day-
  time but the cultivated countryside in
  which they were working did not offer
  them the slightest hope of a hiding-place
  nor could they expect any help from the
  peons living there at night they were
  manacled to posts driven into the ground

     pepe summed it up with his clear and
  simple logic in the villages the people
  give us up if we run the other way we
  are dead before we get to the mountains
  they began to work on ideas for cut-
  ting the chains off their ankles at night
  and although the situation looked hope-
  less ted found himself more light-hearted
  than he had been for a long time life
  had regained some meaning before dis-
  couragement could set in again it was
  announced that the camp was moving to
  temporary quarters farther up the road
  pepe took the news as stolidly as every-
  one else but ted caught his eye and
  thought that it had a gleam in it

     they were packed into trucks and driv-
  en for hours over an impossible road into
  country which grew steadily wilder and
  more mountainous they ate their sup-
  per in the new location and pepe came up
  to them and pretended to quarrel over a
  cigarette which should be returned to
  him for his loan of one the night before

     i was a boy in this country he said
and it is not for strangers to come here
 and cheat me

    ted answered him soothingly and he
  dropped his voice like a man whose griev-
  ance is subsiding but who still wants to
  grumble a little when he was sure the
  bystanders had lost interest he went on
  there is a cave in that cliff that sticks
  out like a nose on the highest mountain
  my father and mother are there i think
  tonight we go it is about five kilo-
  meters he raised his voice if thats
  the way it was well say no more about
  it when you get some you share with
  me

  you bet we will  said shep   
  this camp was to be so temporary that
  shacks had not been built it stood near
  a small grove of eucalyptus trees which
  sheltered a spring a narrow ravine led


from the grove into the heart of a moun-
tain the guards were stirring around
busily parking trucks on each side of the
camp facing in the trucks were to keep
their lights on all night and some guards
would sit in them while others walked
sentry duty the men were issued a
blanket apiece and told to sleep on the
ground the guards grumbled more than
the men over the new arrangement be-
cause it involved too much staying awake
they hoped to spend only one night in
this place

  what they dont know what nobody
knows but me said pepe is that twenty
meters down that ravine is a rock as big
as a house with a crack in it that a man
can squeeze into and work himself up
to the top we get there if we can and
if we get separated we meet in the cave
ted nodded and pepe raised his voice
again all im saying is you need not
have smoked all you had you could
have saved one for me thats all
look here said ted if id had one
id have saved it whats mine is yours
you know that

  pepe nodded mollified and lurched off
to bed himself down on the other side of
the group of men shep and ted looked
at each other this haphazard idea could
hardly be called a plan and yet they
would have seized at an even slimmer
opportunity ted was somewhat shocked
to find himself feeling that he would be
glad to kill all the guards with his bare
hands if that would help the fever
which had been accumulating in him
since he had known that martha was in
the neighborhood had badly cracked his
civilized shell shep grunted

  wed better go im tired of it here
without further consultation they set
about finding a place to sleep on the side
nearest the grove

the men were restless in their new
quarters one after another would sit
up throw off his blankets and ask per-
mission to go out a moment each time
there was great shouting of threats and
objections from the guards it became
a game keeping the guards stirred up
ted and shep took advantage of the con-
fusion each time to edge a little farther
from the crossing beams of light they
could no longer distinguish pepe among
the shapeless rolls of blanket and so con-
certed action was impossible it was a
night without moon but the stars hung
marvelously clear and low and beyond
the crowded camping-space he velvety

  darkness beckoned them black and si-
  lent their nerves stretched taut under
  the necessity for waiting

  after an hour the patience of the
   guards was exhausted two of them
  brought out their long black whips and
  snapped them meaningly over the recum-
  bent men describing not too delicately
  certain things which would happen to the
  next one who made a disturbance others
  produced handcuffs and began locking
  the prisoners together two by two start-
  ing near the fire where the fracas had
  centered many prisoners got up and
  there was a good deal of milling around

    if they once get those things on us
  were cooked whispered ted

    shep nodded straining their eyes
  through the darkness they could see the
  grove not more than forty feet away if
  they could gain that comparative shelter
  they had a good chance of making the ra-
  vine by common consent without say-
  ing anything more they began to crawl
  toward it on their bellies a terrible inch-
  worm progress with the noise of their
  bodies on the ground sounding in their
  ears like an avalanche

    they had gone perhaps ten feet when
  a guard shouted and a bullet cut up a
  little puff of dust just under teds nose
  he got up in one bound and ran as he did
  not know he could he heard another
  bullet smack flatly on the ground be-
  hind him he heard rather than saw
  shep running ahead against the dark
  trees they did not make good targets
  someone behind them yelled for a flash-
  light they were in the grove when its
  beam first reached the trees

    ted found his mind working as clearly
  and rapidly as his legs estimating how
  many guards could be spared to run after
  them not more than three he thought
  with the rest of the prisoners as excited
  as they were he was not conscious of
  making any effort but felt light and free
  as though he could run forever then he
  tripped and fell over a root

    he regained his feet and two more
  strides brought him out of the grove
  someone was running close behind him
  now but not firing that meant that the
  guard who was nearest had emptied his
  revolver and had probably forgotten his
  cartridge-belt the others were afraid to
  shoot since one of their own comrades
  was ahead of them in the darkness the
  beams of light did not reach so far

    now he could see the looming rock of
which pepe had spoken he did not dare

the blue book magazine

lose time by looking around but he could
clearly hear the breathing of the guard
could almost imagine he felt it on the
back of his neck with his pursuer so
near he could not stop to look for the
crevice if the others had reached it al-
ready he would be leading the pursuit
to them and endangering such safety as
they had won he raced on down the
ravine in the dim starlight trusting that
some other way of hiding would reveal
itself

  suddenly he heard a thud behind him
a brief scuffle a cry he turned now and
saw two dark shapes struggling one
fell more men were coming down the
ravine this time with lights instinctive-
ly ted flattened himself on the ground be-
hind a clump of mesquite and tried to
control his labored breathing the flash-
light showed pepe lying on the ground
with the hilt of a knife sticking out of his
throat a man turned him over with a
foot and for a moment ted saw his face
not distorted but open-eyed and smiling
the dark pool under him was widening

  es muerto said the guard retriev-
ing his knife where are the others

  they pointed excitedly in several di-
rections and finally ran off in a body
down the ravine when they had passed
him ted crawled cautiously back the
guards had been right-a man does not
live long with a knife in his throat far
down the ravine ted could see two flash-
lights bobbing along like will-o-the-
wisps they were coming back now

  he felt his way along the stony surface
until his groping hand touched nothing
the crevice was there he slid into it

chapter eleven

an almost inaudible whistle overhead
 made ted look up and in the re-
lief which flooded him his heart pounded
uncomfortably it was dark in the crev-
ice but he could see a thin wedge of stars
twenty feet above him and a head stick-
ing out against them he began to climb
cautiously testing each move before he
made it terrified of dislodging a pebble
because he had to move slowly these
seemed the longest moments since he had
left camp

  at last beyond his own hopes beyond
belief he found himself at the top lying
in a rough shallow basin of rock large
enough for three men pepe had been
right it was a good hiding-place ex-
cept from the hillside directly above it

it was invisible and the guards were not
likely to climb up there until every more
suspicious quarter had been exhausted

  as ted finally heaved himself over the
rim shep put a hand on his shoulder and
squeezed it hard

  you- saw pepe  ted whispered

  yes he thought you couldnt make
it

  ted felt the tears smart under his lids
that fanatical faintly ridiculous guy
making no sense throwing his life away
for a man he had known only a month-
never thinking just rushing out after the
first idea he got lying on the rock
afraid to speak for fear of being over-
heard ted shut his eyes and pressed his
hand hard over them

in imagination he heard himself of-
fering to help pepe he could see pepes
eyes gleam in the firelight see his head
bobbing on its skinny neck hear him say
i am your brother it had been funny
at the time well pepe had meant it
all right staring up at the low big stars
ted remembered that a spaniard had in-
vented don quixote

  the guards were coming back now
freely cursing the americanos manana
they said manana they would comb the
countryside the men couldnt go far
on foot and without food or weapons it
would have been better to have killed
them of course but they would be picked
up never fear a hundred miles from a
railroad how would they make it it
was bad luck they got away-the captain
would be angry but in this cursed dark-
ness what could a man do  the guards
passed on leaving pepe to be buried in
the morning after a moment there was
a distant babble from the camp

  manana said shep we have got
to be in that cave vamos

  they crawled out of thfeir hiding-place
and up the hillside as quietly as possible
near the top shep motioned to ted to
lie down and crawl so that they should
not show against the skyline when they
had put the ridge of the hill between them
and the camp he stood up took a deep
breath and stretched himself all around
them the silent black mountainous coun-
try lay as empty as it had been when time
began

  oh boy  said shep aloud it does
a man good to breathe for a change

  ted roused himself out of thoughts of
pepe reminding himself that brooding
would do no good what was done was
done and could not be changed
anything might happen

  which way he asked trying to
sound more cheerful than he felt

  well i took a bearing on the stars
before we left camp and figured wed
better head straight for that big low one
sitting on the highest hill if we dont
pick up our landmarks when we get across
this valley well try the next one here
goes

  they set off down the hillside

  the cave was according to pepes in-
formation about five kilometers off and
five kilos can be a long way in darkness
and uncertainty in the valleys they
waded in the irrigation ditches

  just in case shep said they fetch
up some dogs

  nice idea said ted

  dont worry shep reassured him
scent doesnt lie long in this dry coun-
try 

  occasionally they would lie down in
a field of wheat or alfalfa drinking a lit-
tle from the ditch and resting for the
next climb then they would burst their
lungs again scrambling up a mountain-
side stopping to listen like hunted ani-
mals for sounds which might indicate pur-
suit shep apostrophized the star which
he had selected for his beacon

  dont you go and set on us

  it wont matter said ted ive got
the whole sky by now right up to the
zenith

  but the stars began to fade at last and
disappeared into a pale white sky and
dawn found them on a remote bleak
mountainside without the faintest idea
where they were

  by jiminy said shep i think we
missed it in the dark

he and ted sat down and looked at
each other ruefully and at the bare
country around them which would hard-
ly give sustenance to a jackrabbit if
they went down into the green valleys
they would be caught if they stayed up
on the mountains they would starve
they did not need to discuss these things
they were both perfectly conscious of
them so instead they took stock of each
other their shoes which had been near-
ly worn out when they started wece now
slit through and their trouser-legs in rib-
bons from the knee down ted had lost
the skin on one side of his left arm below
the elbow and sheps thumb was cut and
swelling painfully now that they had
stopped they felt exhausted

  well said shep two such looking
people sure cant travel in the daytime

and they wont get here for a while lets
pile up behind those rocks and get us
some rest

  ted lay down without protest at the
moment his numb brain could not think
of anything better to do he stretched
out and put his head on his arms

the equatorial noonday sun wakened
him hours later at first he could not
orientate himself

  then it all came back and he slowly
rolled his sun-blistered body over and
looked around shep snored peacefully
a few feet away with his instinct for
comfort he had somehow burrowed him-
self into the partial shade of a rock ted
looked to the other side-and met the
unblinking eyes of a shriveled old in-
dian woman

  she squatted on the ground wrapped in
a dirty but brightly striped hand-woven
shawl under a filthy round felt hat
made of beaten llama hair her seamed lit-
tle face peered out like an incredibly an-
cient monkey it was impossible to tell
whether her look indicated sympathy or
hostility or mere curiosity

  ted nudged shep allowed a moment
for the slow grunting process which shep
called waking up then nodded toward the
old woman

  do you see what i see  he asked

  must be i do shep admitted uncer-
tainly

  then its really there had me scared
for a moment just then a thought oc-
curred to him which wiped the smile
from his face good god do you sup-
pose it could be pepes mother

  the old woman had not changed ex-
pression when they began to talk but
at the word pepe she smiled faintly
and bobbed her head in a motion poign-
antly reminiscent

  how will i tell her shep ted asked

  let me sehora usted es la madre
de pepe huertez

  there was no doubt about her smile
now her eyes almost disappeared into
deep wrinkles but all she allowed herself
to say was si

  we knew pepe well in the prison-
camp

  the old woman held out a clawlike
hand

  friends to pepe she asked in brok-
en spanish

  yes

  when comes pepe

  shep lost his nerve where is your
husband 


the blue book magazine

with some blankets on the other a few
earthenware pots a wooden stool a stone
mortar for grinding coffee or meal-in
fact all the household effects of pepes
mother on a ledge in the rock stood a
highly colored picture of a madonna and
a curious little wooden image of a man
with his knees up to his chin

  sit down she said stay here i
make coffee

  gracias senora said shep

  she shook her head me shira she
corrected and gathering a few things
scuttled out to the flat shelving rock at
the mouth of the cave where she had
made herself a little oven of three large
stones with another on top

  ted sat down on the straw with his el-
bows on his knees and his fists on his
temples shep watched him for a mo-
ment then laid a hand on his shoulder

  the old woman closed her eyes and
jerked a thumb toward the earth
dead then after a silence which no
one wanted to fill in she asked pepe
comes soon

  senora said ted your son pepe
was a very brave man he died last
night when we escaped died trying to
save me i would have stopped him if
i could

  the old woman did not understand she
shook her head and smiled apologetically
ted leaned forward and took her hand

  mother of pepe he said pepe is
dead

  now it got through to her her eyes
searched teds face

  when died 

  last night

  the mother of pepe let go of ted and
folded her hands against her breast she

 do you sec what i see ted asked
 must be i do shep admitted

 continued to look at him but he knew
 that she did not see him any more she
 might have been carved of stone and her
 tearless wizened face a symbol of all the
 griefs at last she spoke

   soon i die too she said with a final-
 ity which did not permit of any argu-
 ment she got up you pepes friends
 you come with me

   ted and shep followed her humbly
 she climbed only a few feet to an over-
 hanging ledge bent down and pushed
 aside a screen of brush they crawled
 after her and found themselves in a large
 cave when a candle had been lighted
 they could see on one side a pile of straw
  she showed them an opening at the
back of the cave barely large enough to
squeeze through which led through a lit-
tle tunnel to a smaller cave behind then
she beckoned them to follow her out to
the ledge in the thin air they cout see
for fifty miles fifty miles of superb moun-
tainous country with green fields flower-
ing in the valleys just before them the
mountain dropped sharply away and
three hundred feet below a trail of a road
wound at the bottom

  listen said shira suddenly

and stuffiness of the cave free air was
too sweet the sense of being unconfined
too delicious to sacrifice even a moment
unnecessarily

  it seemed to ted watching a few gold-
colored clouds drifting across the evening
sky that he had never been really alive
before after a month in which he had
tried to turn himself into an automaton
moving unthinkingly while other pulled
the strings his life had suddenly been
given back to him placed in his own
hands again that he was ragged dirty
hungry and tired that he was a hunted
man-these things did not matter he
had regained his individuality he could

anything might happen

  guess you never had anybody die sav-
ing you before

  i never did

 i did once couple of men in my
regiment i couldnt figure it out for a
long time a couple of swell guys were
dead and i was alive-to go back and
measure calico in a small-town store it
didnt add up then i figured well what
the hell its all in the cards you just
play them the best you can

 thanks said ted and managed a
one-sided smile

  before long shira came back with hot
mate and fried corn porridge

  now she said when they had fin-
ished you stay i go i come back if
men come you hide here

  straining their ears they could hear a
distant popping like remote tiny fire-
works is revolution said shira

  she set off down the mountain with
her jerky scuttling gait and soon they
saw her beetlelike figure moving rapidly
along the trail below they stayed where
they were when they lay flat on the
ledge they could not be seen from the
road and above them were only the
eagles and the vultures they were both
reluctant to go back into the obscurity
the blue book magazine

lie on this rock as long as he chose he
could watch the clouds or sleep he could
speak or be silent without compulsion
he had not known the importance of such
privileges before had not known how to
value them then he remembered at
what price he had been given this free-
dom and felt ashamed of his enjoyment
but not for long the springs of his hap-
piness were too deep they welled up and
washed away the regret which his con-
science told him he should feel after all
he thought death was a kind of freedom
too the ultimate in freedom

  as the sun set they heard in the dis-
tance hoof-beats shouts and the creaking
of many wagons a large party of some
kind was coming along the trail they
started to crawl in then reconsidered
the searchers who might come for them
would be silent men moving swiftly on
foot or perhaps mounted on horses and
accompanied by the baying of dogs
these noises were too domestic to be
alarming lying flat peering cautious-
ly over they watched a cavalcade go by

  first came a string of oxcarts loaded
with goods bedding food two huge old
spanish chests two indian girls there
followed a train of little burros then
about twenty head of cattle driven by
dark-faced vaqueros at the end of the
procession rode two men and a woman
draped in black perched side-saddle on
a big white mule the men had guns
across their saddles

  looks like it might be a revolution
at that said shep and some big family
is making a get-away

  the wagons creaked out of sight the
animals followed them slowly and the red
sun dropped behind the rim of the sky

chapter twelve

after the cavalcade had disappeared
 the road was not deserted for long
in the swift dusk and even in the dark-
ness band after band of silent peons
passed three or four together hurrying
toward some unknown rendezvous in the
direction from which the wagon-train had
come shira did not return ted and
shep lay a long while on the ledge watch-
ing the activity until the mountain chill
began to stiffen their bones

big doings said shep at last stretch-
ing but im about to freeze out here
right ted answered only i hate
to go into that hole again i had a bath
thirty days ago and im particular

  in spite of everything they slept bet-
ter than they expected and when ted
crawled again out of the darkness of the
cave the sun was high and shira was
squatting on the ledge cooking a chicken
in her primitive fireplace ted yelled the
good-news to shep who arrived in rec-
ord time snapped out of sleepiness by the
prospect of real food they felt it un-
wise to inquire how shira had collected
the chicken obviously she had no money
to buy it and it seemed equally unlikely
that it had been given to her it tasted
delicious roasted on a spit over the fire
and they gladly accepted it from her dirty
little claws and ate it with relish

shira had collected much informa-
tion in her broken spanish mixed
with plentiful lapses into quechua the in-
dian dialect she made them understand
that no one was looking for them on the
contrary the prisoners had been hastily
loaded into the trucks and rushed back to
the barracks why because of course
the revolution had begun if those con-
victs were left in the open and the fight-
ing came close they might all get away
and while the seiiors knew some of them
were good men it could not be denied
that some of them were bad and better
shut up yes it was the revolution
the patrn was at the head of it and
hacienda tranquilla was like a fort all
the men in the countryside were going
there and getting arms and going to
march on bolto

  why were they going but of course
because those were the patrdns orders
besides that it was said in the villages
that they were to be paid as well it was
also said that maladon had already fall-
en but that was so far away that no one
ever went there and so no one cared
the don had sent his treasure and most
of his household up to the old ranch-
house in the mountains-the one his
grandfather had lived in before he built
the big one her father had worked on
the big one ai-ai the old don drove
his people hard he had been the one
for getting things done this don spent
more time away he let his overseers
have too much authority when that
happened people suffered more the one
to come might be better-who could tell 

  shira spat these two men had been
sent her by her son therefore they were
in a sense members of her family and
could be talked to and not treated to the
silence which was reserved for superiors
shira liked to talk when she felt it was
anything might happen

safe with some difficulty and much tact
ted got her back to the subject he was
interested in

 the old ranchhouse oh yes she
knew that one her mother had taken
her there when she was a child the road
was bad then and it was bad now because
no one had ever done anything about it
it was at least three days walk on the
road it was right on the other side of
the mountains where they began to slope
down into the jungle it had thick walls
with slits in them to shoot through no-
body knew how old it was it had been
built by the first don she well remem-
bered going there the old patrdn had
been alive then the grandfather of this
one tall he was with white hair very
much white hair and-

teds impatience got the better of
him

  listen shira the don has a girl in
his house  an american girl 

 shira looked blank she had been
about to tell one of her best stories
and she did not like being interrupted
these norte-americanos were nice men
they were friends of pepes and they were
dependent on her in her dim mind they
had become in a way her sons she had
stolen for them and fed them as if they
had been sons sons were supposed to
keep quiet when their mother talked

  try to listen shira a girl-a girl
with yellow hair-at hacienda tranquil-
la

  shira nodded grudgingly oh yes
she had seen that one

  is she still there shira did she go
to the mountains do you know where
she is

  shira sighed boys were all alike
you tried to tell them things-old things
which you knew and they did not and
then it turned out that all the time they
were thinking about the girls

no s she answered stubbornly
shira you must know you could
find out anyway you could ask some-
body you know somebody who works
at the ranchhouse dont you

  shira sighed again might as well give
up pepe had been the same --
my brothers grandchild lolita she is
maid to that senorita

  i knew you could tell me something 
said ted triumphantly is it far to the
hacienda tranquilla 

  no not far one morning maybe
maybe less

  could you take me there

  fella exclaimed shep youre nuts
theyd shoot you like a sitting duck
and leaving that out of it-pardon me if
i get personal-you dont look much like
loves young dream frankly a girl look-
ing at you right now would be just a lit-
tle bit inclined to scream if youre
smart youll just leave martha her mem-
ories

  look im not such a fool as to think

i	could charge right in but if i could
hide in the neighborhood it might make
a lot of sense you cant tell if theres
fighting she may need help

  shep looked disgusted hell you
dont even know shes there yet

  ted turned back to the old woman
shira you could get into the ranch
couldnt you

  shira nodded without enthusiasm
well will you go and find out if she
is there if she is take her a message
you will do it wont you

  shira leaned back against the rock
her little nutshell of a face seemed to
shrivel into the shade of the big felt hat
shira tires herself she stated flatly
of course you are tired i didnt mean
you should go right away i wouldnt
think of asking you to do a thing like
that but later when you are rested
ill do anything for you of course i
havent much right now but later-
gosh shep what can i give her to get her
to go

shep stared disinterestedly at the re-
mote horizon i really wouldnt know
you dont need to take that attitude
you might fall for somebody yourself one
day

  i might and i might not

  if you did i would at least try to
help you out ill write a message no
good ttying to get shira to remember
anything but what can i write on 

frenziedly ted looked around
and at last an idea came to him he
took a stick and held it in the fire until
the end of it charred black then he
picked up one of the three earthen pots
and broke it

  ai-ai cried shira

  now you dont need to worry when

i	get out of here ill buy you fifty pots
yes and a house too a house where
nobody will ever bother you again youd
like that wouldnt you a house that
was all your own and fifty pots

shira grunted that was how pepe had
talked her husband too for that matter
men were like that living for things that
did not happen you could look at this
boy and see that he had nothing

  ted wrote feverishly on the flattest
fragment i have escaped and am in
hiding are you all right  and signed his
name there was no room for more

  here shira please do me the favor
to take it to her you are so kind you
will do it wont you

shira held the fragment in her skin-
ny fingers and looked at it curiously
she might as well give in to him she
could see that he would give her no peace
until she did

 manana i go she said and the
piece of pottery disappeared into some
mysterious recess of her garments

  you couldnt make it today ted
ventured after you have rested of
course

  manana answered shira calmly
she fished out of her dress a package
wrapped in a rag took out a portion of
coco-leaf put it in her mouth and began
to chew her eyes staring blankly in front
of her soon they closed and a look of
satisfaction came over her face only the
slow rhythmical movement of her jaws
showed that she was still awake

  i dont suppose there is any way of
getting her started before she is ready to
go ted mused

  if youll take my advice fella tomor-
row will see us heading for the coast
while the countrys upset weve got our
best chance of slipping through

  we cant leave martha now

  ive seen dames who couldnt take
care of themselves but they werent this
evans girl

  you dont seem to realize what she
may be up against im worried as hell
ok grunted shep

  no longer exhausted ted found it im-
possible to sleep and the night intermi-
nable about midnight shep invited him
feelingly to go outside because the fleas
made quieter bedfellows he stepped
over the hunched little form of shira and
crawled into the moonlight during the
afternoon she had showed them the shal-
low grave she had dug for her husband
and had regretted the lack of strength
which made her unable to do better ted
began searching the hillside for stones to
pile on top of it as a marker and a pro-
tection the work soothed him and he
had raised a respectable cairn by the time
he felt tired enough to go in again and
rest it was nearly dawn when he fell
asleep and to his horror when he woke

  up the sun had climbed halfway across
the sky and shira sat peacefully on the
ledge as if she intended never to leave it

  have you been to the ranch yet  he
inquired although he knew very well
what the answer would be

 nogo today tomorrow maybe

  in vain ted pleaded with her there
was meal enough in the cave to last
through this day why should she make
this tiring trip for nothing at last ted
had an inspiration

  i worked for you all last night he
told her and led her out to see the cairn
she looked at it in silence and a tear
rolled down one withered cheek

  i go now she said and set off down
the mountain

  ted and shep put in the afternoon as
best they could watching the road only
increased their impatience so they went
back in the hills to a spring shira had
showed them and bathed vigorously in
the cool water in the cave they found a
little bundle of her husbands clothes
which she had thriftily put away and
decided that she would not object if they
borrowed a few things to eke out their
ragged costumes like the pot which ted
had broken such loans could be more
than repaid later on they regretted that
peons did not wear shoes

  at one time they heard scattered bursts
of distant firing which lasted half an
hour but they could see nothing though
they climbed to the top of the mountain
they cooked and ate the remainder of
the meal when it grew dark they put
out the fire lest they attract attention

  according to the stars and the moon
it was after midnight when they heard
footsteps there were no voices only an
unmistakable scrambling and sliding not
one person but several climbing up fair-
ly distant at first but coming nearer
ted cautiously crawled out to the ledge
and looked over he could see them dis-
tinctly three of them plain against the
moon-drenched mountainside in front he
recognized shiras little shapeless figure
and big felt hat behind her came two
men they dipped into a shadow and
disappeared when they emerged the
faint light glittered on their gunbarrels

chapter thirteen

there was no time to get out ted
caught up the big knife the only
weapon he could see and quickly crawled
after shep into the hole at the back which


behind shira came two men light glittered on their gunbarrels

shira had showed them soon they heard
her come with the two men into the cave
and sit down puffing in a moment the
light of a candle glimmered through the
crack

  its a good thing we found you old
grandmother said one of the men and
his voice sounded young almost boyish
weve had a hot day

  shira grunted

  a second voice spoke deeper but with
a gruffness which seemed exaggerated as
though the owner were determined to

  convince everyone including himself
  that he was a dangerous man

    i still say you were a fool to hide in
that straw-stack instead of running
ho jose why do you complain  most
of those who ran are still lying in that
alfalfa field and wont be getting up you
and i are alive-and have our guns
but what good is a gun without bul-
lets  and how will we get out of here 
leave that to the saints and old
grandmother theyve looked after us so
far hold old one got anything to eat 

the blue book magazine

  no said shira stubbornly

  ted and shep heard the men stirring
as though they did not accept the denial
and were rummaging around for them-
selves to see what they could find sud-
denly one of them exclaimed his voice
rising almost to a squeak in his surprise

  jose look there have been men
here 

  what did i tell you shouted jose
entirely forgetting to be gruff its a
trap-shes brought us into a trap
where are they old woman

  no si

  where are they tell me now or ill
beat your brains out

  ted hitched himself closer to the open-
ing the men had admitted that they had
no ammunition but to get back into the
big cave he would have to crawl through
headfirst presenting a perfect target for
a rifle-butt

  how i know asked shira quietly
you see me come

  you know something you never wore
these shoes nor these pants either

ted could see the cave now shira
squatted near her pots apparently as
calm as she had ever been a man stood
over her his back to ted his rifle raised
by the barrel in both hands as though he
would bring it down on her head the
other man was invisible from this angle
but his rifle leaned against the rock near
the candle not three feet from the open-
ing through which ted would have to
crawl there was no time to lose he
took a desperate chance his hand shot
out and extinguished the candle in the
darkness he grabbed a pair of legs and
brought someone down on top of him

  he pulled his feet through the hole
and rolled away from the opening a
knife grazed his shoulder and he caught
the hand that held it to his surprise
the fingers were as small and weak as a
girls the knife clattered down and was
lost in the darkness another moment
and he had his opponents arms pinned
down and was sitting astride a squirm-
ing slender body

  shep he panted ive got mine
where are you 

  here this ones down already
you no hurt him said shira s quiet
voice him nice boy

  she struck a match and the candle
flickered up again ted was holding his
man face down with his arms twisted
across his back across the cave lay the
other apparently unconscious with the

first glimmer of light shep collected both
rifles and the knife the one who had
been knocked out opened enormous dark
eyes and looked up with a curious mix-
ture of defiance and fear

y gosh said shep theyre only
kids

  we are soldiers of the government
asserted the one on the floor trying to
sit up

  yvell get up sonny we arent going
to hurt you

  ted let go of his prisoner who rolled
over and climbed to his feet rubbing his
strained arms

  viva la republica he said sullenly
through clenched teeth

  thats all right shep answered
were loyalistas too lets talk things
over ill keep the guns for now and
you on the floor-take out your knife
arid hand it to my friend we dont want
any accidents as soon as we understand
each other well get along fine

  the boy with the big gruff voice shook
his head as though he would clear it
scowled and put the knife into teds out-
stretched hand they could not have
been more than sixteen either of them
a first faint down was just beginning to
appear on their upper lips and their eyes
were still soft as womens might be

  viva la republicai said ted i
hope its got some bigger soldiers than
you two boys are

  jose scowled fiercely we are good
soldiers he growled

  i can see that shep answered in a
conciliatory tone my friend and i are
waiting for a chance to join up too the
people of north america sent us down
here to fight for your side but those rapa-
cious bloodsuckers the capitalistas caught
us and threw us in prison we just got
away suppose you tell us what has been
going on

  do you believe him tomas asked
jose uncertainly

  tomas considered although he was
the smaller and the weaker he liked to
be the mental giant of the two it was
he who made the plans and jos who
grumblingly carried them out

  i believe that they are north ameri-
cans he said at last i have seen such
men before they do not usually wear
beards and they are usually cleaner but
they all talk in that funny way

  i have heard that all north americans
are capitalists jos objected

  these do not look as if they could be


anything might happen

  joses eyes narrowed as he studied ted
and finally widened in triumph

  that one is out of the road-gang my
uncle was in it and he wore just such a
shirt

  this discovery reassured tomas he
turned back to shep

  will you swear by the blood of jesus
and the milk of mary that what you have
told us is true

  i will swear it

  i too affirmed ted solemnly

  tomas looked relieved that is a big
oath they have sworn i think we can
trust them

  tomas and jose glad now of a chance
to talk began to tell shep and ted about
the revolution that morning they had
seen their first action and they discussed
it like boys who had just played in their
first important football game awed im-
pressed and feeling more important than
they had ever done before

  they had been sent out with a small
detachment from bolto for an attack on
the hacienda tranquilla it had been
a sort of suicide squad intended only to
keep the attack on the capital from be-
ing made in full force they had taken
a circuitous route escaped attention
flanked don miguels army and fallen
upon his rear as he was marching for-
ward they had never reached the ranch
and most of them had been killed

  but it is not to be supposed said
tomas proudly that we did no good
for we delayed the revolutionists very
much the captain told me that before
he died they had to turn back to fight
us most of them and that gave time to
strengthen the barricades they did not
get in i think and they wont either

grandmother cried joss tired
vj of conversation im starving
give me some food

  ai-ail shira clapped her hand to
her forehead here she had been enjoy-
ing her new family but like a bad mother
she had nothing to give them she looked
from one to another four of them big
boys too what a lot of chickens it
would take she could never steal
enough if they stayed in the cave-they
would all starve with the country so
torn up they could probably escape be-
ing shot

  i have nothing she said sadly to-
morrow we go

  tomas slapped his thigh sure grand-
mother tomorrow we go we take the
americans with us and go back to bolto

i remember the road we can get
through

  good  cried jose they will come
with us and fight for the captain
tomas looked sad the captain is
dead silly you saw him fall

  thats right of course i had for-
gotten theyll fight for the colonel then
weve got him left

  its agreed 

  tomas held out his hand and shep
took it but ted hesitated

  wait a minute shep you forget
ive got business around here and it will
have to be attended to first shira when
you left this morning you were going to
the ranch for me did you go

  shira nodded

  did you see the senorita 

  shira nodded again

  but say something did you give her
my letter  how is she 

  is all right

  she must have said something to you
talk to lolita lolita talk to me
didnt she give you any message for
me

  oh sure

shira produced a white envelope-
considerably soiled by contact with
her person-addressed in a firm hand
ted seized it and tore it open he had
never seen that writing before yet he
would have sworn that he recognized it
he held it close to the candle and read
as if to remember every word forever

  dear ted

  it is wonderful news that you are near
  and all right i suppose that means shep
  too we seem to have stuck our ameri-
  can necks into quite a jam havent we

  you must not worry about me the
  don is kindness itself and has promised
  to take good care of me he seems quite
  sure that his coup will go through all
  right and then he will see me safely out
  of the country i confess i dont know
  what it is all about

  i cant write more now as i mustnt get
  caught communicating with people it
  would be bad for the don where did
  you get the wonderful messenger send
  her again if you can

                    best regards

                              martha

  shep who had shamelessly looked over
teds shoulder while he was reading
slapped him on the back

  shes worried about me too fella
did you get that


  there are loo many spies ft round

  i can see she hasnt the slightest idea
what is going on snapped ted crossly
that old man must have hypnotized her
im going to get her out of there
wait a minute dont go off half
cocked

  ive listened to you long enough im
going down there and im going now
he turned impatiently to shira who
had just settled down on her bit of straw
and provided herself with a large cud of
coco-leaf he called her but she gave
no sign of having heard him he took
her by the shoulder and shook her gently
she opened one eye and looked at him
with patient tolerance

  shira ive got to get down to the
ranch

  me tired

  i know that shira i dont expect
you to go just tell me the way tell
me the general direction tll get there
by myself

  no use

  of course its some use ive got by
this far and i wont get caught now
no use

  dont keep saying that over and over
like a damned parrot you tell me the
way i wont let you sleep until you do
senorita not there

  what do you mean shes not there
you just told me you had seen her and
you gave me this letter

  senorita goes with pedro to old ranch
this afternoon

chapter fourteen

until then ted had not realized
what it had meant to him to feel that
martha was in the neighborhood nor
how much he had counted on the pos-
sibility of seeing her for a few mo-
ments he stared at shira unable to speak
when he recovered himself shep had an
argument on his hands

  look at the facts he kept saying
over and over look at the facts

  the facts as shep stated them were
clear and simple martha had been
moved fifty miles away to a spot chosen
for its inaccessibility even to people who
knew the country well moreover the
old ranch would undoubtedly be strongly
guardett and in these times vigilance
would not be relaxed if ted were able
to find his way there which was doubt-
ful he would certainly not be able to get
in if he got in by impersonating a peon
which incidentally would not fool any-
body he would not be able to get out if
he got out he would not be able to get
martha out with him and if he did get
martha out with him what would he do
with her and how would he take her
through mile after mile of unfriendly
country she was safer under the pro-
tection of the don than she would be
running around with a penniless un-
armed ex-convict who probably had a
price on his head

vvye have to look at things the way
w they are and not how we want
them to be concluded shep

  we cant just sit here and rot

  no need for that well join up with
the boys

  suppose they lose

  shep winked with us fighting for
them 

  he went on with his argument patient-
ly repeating one point after another the
time had come to join up because obvi-
ously they were not going to get very far
unless they did once in the army they
might have a chance to take the old ranch

  frankly said shep i like to eat
i want to go some place where they
feed you

  one point shep ignored so completely
that ted felt embarrassed about bring-
ing it up it occurred to him forcibly
that they might get shot in the army  but
he hated to be the first to mention it and
so he kept quiet in the end he agreed
with everything shep said and they
dropped off to sleep

  ted dreamed that a prison guard was
pinching him he woke to find himself
clutched by shiras little bony claw

  we go now she said too many for
travel in daytime she explained

  she began collecting her effects the
two remaining pots disappeared under her
poncho so did the knife and two or three
candle-ends and the box of matches
she looked a long time at the highly col-
ored picture of the virgin and sighed
evidently there were limits to the amount
which cotild be stowed about her per-
son at last she picked up the curious
little squatting figure and tucked it away
looks like youre moving out said
shep

  shira nodded and smiled

youre safer here old lady youd
better wait here for us if you come
along something might happen to you
no matter said shira cheerfully

  all five slid down the mountain-side
without speaking and went quietly along
the road only ted and shep could be
heard walking in spite of the rags with
which they had replaced their worn-out
shoes the others were as silent as cats
shira set a fast pace and they followed
her for about an hour the young moon
had gone down and the stars were fad-
ing when they came to the edge of a small
village shira went straight to the door
of one of the adobe houses set crookedly
along the dusty road pushed it open and
walked in without ceremony two old
indians a man and a woman sleeping on
a mat in the corner of the room started
up and stared with frightened eyes at the
soldiers and the ragged men shira spoke
to them quickly and softly in quechua
and after some conversation turned
around with a satisfied air

  these my cousins she said you
stay here

  ted said you have relatives every-
where havent you

  sure said shira

  the old woman whose guests they had
suddenly become blew up a little fire on
the hearth and in a short time produced
frijoles and coco tomas found in his
pocket a real which he gave in payment
and which was cheerfully accepted it
developed too that he could speak que-
chua having learned it from an indian
grandmother and so he could explain
jvhat went on

these were two of don miguels
peons they had a son in his army it
would of course be fatal for them to hide
any of his enemies so they were leaving
at once for their work in the fields the
men could stay there or go it was noth-
ing so long as they did not know abeut it
if they roused the village to take these
men prisoners there would be too much
talk and they might be blamed be-
sides all the men of fighting age were
away with the army and these men had
guns   

  they began to dress for the day a sim-
ple process consisting of putting two col-

ored ponchos over their heads and slap-
ping on two big white felt hats as the
man turned his bare back to them in
dressing ted could see the healed scars
of a lash across his shoulders at the
door the indian hesitated his work-
knotted fingers played for a moment un-
certainly with the wooden bar which
locked it and an almost human gleam
came into his dull eyes

  if you meet my juan you remember
he said and went out followed by his
wife through the door as it quickly
opened and shut they could see the gray
light creeping over the dusty little town

inside the hut it was still dark  but by
the embers and the light which be-
gan to trickle through the cracks in the
door and the shutter objects were visible
it was almost as bare of belongings as
shiras cave had been the earthen floor
was polished by centuries of bare feet
but around the stone hearth the earth
appeared to have been disturbed recently

  the day wore on  the men did not
dare speak for fear of being overheard
there was absolutely nothing to do ex-
cept lie on the dirty bare ground the
stone began to have a fascination for
shep he started to poke around it
found it loose and more to keep him-
self occupied than anything else set care-
fully and silently to work to raise it
tomas helped him with a stick of wood
for a lever they were repaid for their
curiosity far beyond their expectations
a groove had been dug in the earth be-
neath the stone and in the groove lay an
object which had for them an especial
beauty a new and shining german rifle
of the latest make

  evidently the don had been lavish and
careless with arms for his men  for some-
how he had dealt out one too many and
it had been left behind shep slid back
the bolt saw that it was loaded and his
eyes gleamed with delight they care-
fully replaced the hearth and smoothed
the earth down around it

  apparently the loyalty of the peons to
their patron had definite limits it did
not include refusing to shelter his ene-
mies if it seemed more convenient to do
so and it did not include returning a
weapon which had by chance come into
their hands but which certainly had not
been intended for them there was no
open rebellion in these people but there
was the hidden resistance of the slave

  tomas began moving quietly around
the hut running his hand into the palm-
the blue book magazine

leaf thatch which served as a roof rats
and lizards which squeaked dropped out
and ran across the room a spider as big
as the palm of his hand jumped onto his
shoulder and then to the floor where
jose put a foot on it not finding what he
wanted around the eaves tomas took
the wooden stool and stood on it he had
grown up in a hut like this he knew
where things were likely to be grin-
ning in silent delight he pulled a small
box of ammunition from the highest point
of the roof

it was a disappointment that the car-
tridges did not fit the government rifles
which he and jose were carrying but
since they now had at least one function-
ing weapon the spirits of the party rose
to such a degree of optimism that they
found it difficult to keep still the sun
began to come through the chinks in the
shutter and they could hear the village
stirring around them shira who had
watched everything they did as though
it were to be expected got up and went
out ted put his eye to a crack saw her
plant herself on the doorstep lean back
comfortably and start chewing coco

  apparently she was well known in the
village for everyone who passed spoke
to her seeming to take it as a matter of
course that she should be sunning herself
in front of her relatives house she
seemed to be something of a wit in her
own language for her replies to the greet-
ings usually produced giggles one after
another all the people filed by on their
way to work old men women children
each carrying a hoe or rake a pickax or
shovel in proportion to their strength
the faces of the six-year-olds were as
grave and intent as those of their elders
and they walked silently with a full con-
sciousness of having attained to adult
responsibilities only the mothers with
babies at their breasts appeared to be
exempt and the tiny ones who toddled
naked up and down the road

  the sun climbed higher and higher
beat fiercely on the thatch and the atmos-
phere in the close little hut grew stifling
ted and the two boys woke up bathed in
sweat and it was too hot to think of sleep-
ing any more each one crawled as close
to a crack as possible and lay in silent
misery

  the day ended at last and the cool air
began to creep with the darkness into the
hut shira gave up her vigil on the door-
step and shuffled away the unwilling
host and hostess did not come back hav-

ing apparently decided to establish an
alibi by visiting friends until all danger
had passed with nightfall the village
relaxed for its brief evening there
would be no artificial lights to keep the
peopleawake no restlessness left in them
after a day of unremitting physical toil
there were no young men to sing or quar-
rel or talk to the girls the young wives
sat and sighed on their doorsteps the
girls strolled by in twos and threes scuf-
fling the dust with their toes and talking
in subdued voices little by little the
small noises grew less and sound sub-
sided into silence in the deep oblivion
of heavy sleep everything was forgotten
the hidden men strained their ears and
heard nothing then the board door
creaked and shira came in

  she had some slices of black bread and
a pineapple which she doled out in the
darkness she did not waste time talking
to the younger men but whispered for
a moment to shep who then told the
others that they were to go out one by
one and wait for each other beyond the
last house jose and tomas would go
first for without their uniform tunics and
rifles which ted would carry they could
pass as boys from a neighboring village
ted would follow them and shep would
take the place of most danger the rear
carrying the gun

  shira and the boys went out like shad-
ows when he had waited a little it was
teds turn the cool air felt like wine
to his lungs and he drank it in as he
walked along as quickly and quietly as
possible all the doors were shut and
no sound came from any of the crooked
little huts a dog barked and the bark
ended in a squeal as someone hit it in
these troubled times no one cared to
know why strange feet walked the roads
it was safer not to inquire into the iden-
tity of dark shapes which might pass dur-
ing the night

they met without incident and trav-
eled on until morning next day they
lay by in the hills and refreshed them-
selves with a jackrabbit stew shot by
shep and cooked in shiras pots on the
second night they camped in a spot from
which they could look down and see the
city of bolto lying in its wide green val-
ley with the white glory of the snow-
capped mountains behind it there was
fighting on the low side of the town lit-
tle feathers of artillery-smoke bloomed
out followed by the thud of a big gun
and the unimportant popping of rifle-fire

anything might happen

toward evening a crowd of antlike figures
ran back from the town and out into the
fields

  jose and tomas thumped each other on
the shoulders

  we are making them run  they cried
look  they will never get in  we are
using the monastery as a fort they will
never cross the bridge

  i dont understand this gunfire said
shep critically in english i dont hear
any machine-guns and unless they are
short of ammunition they ought to make
that big one talk more often this is
a hell of a war

  the boys could not understand him
but they caught his tone he saw their
crestfallen faces and made haste to cheer
them up

  i was talking about the guns and not
the fighting when we get in there to-
morrow well show them something
the two boys beamed there was no
doubt in their minds that captain chip
would win the war

all night they climbed in a circuitous
 route over the steep mountains haul-
ing themselves up slope after slope only
to slide down again into incredible val-
leys don miguels troops had seized the
railway and the roads to the capital ex-
cept where the high hills closed it in so
that easier methods of approach had to
be avoided in all the climbing and the
walking shira astonished them by her
endurance dawn found them scram-
bling down a footpath which ran through
a precariously tilted peach orchard to
meet the first mean houses of the town
the poorer people perched their little
huts here where the steep grades made
the land cheap just beyond the first few
houses a squad of soldiers appeared from
around a corner and halted them

  advance and give the countersign
called the corporal in charge

  bolivari replied tomas confidently
that was all right two days ago said
the corporal but it is no good now
we were in the rear-guard action
tomas explained third regiment sec-
ond company we got cut off weve
just made our way here	

  the corporal spread his feet apart and
spat to the side of the path he was a
dark hairy man with a big nose and the
collar of his tunic was already unbut-
toned although the edge of the sun had
just shone over the mountain-top

  a fellow hears all kinds of stories
these days he remarked

  look at our uniforms tomas insist-
ed theyre the same as yours our
guns too only-weve used up all our
ammunition

  you have have you well who are
these beauties youve picked up

  the gentlemen are sent from america
of the north tomas answered proudly
to help us win

  the corporal took a good look at them
threw back his head and laughed up-
roariously the merriment communicat-
ed itself to his men ted felt himself
getting red in the face he stepped for-
ward and spoke in his best spanish

  it is regrettable that you have not a
proper appreciation of our efforts in your
behalf it should be plain you son of a
pig that we have been reduced to our
present ragged condition by our devotion
to your cause if we are not treated with
the proper respect our country will be
very angry it may even be necessary to
send some marines here i demand to be
taken at once to your general

  you talk big shouted the corporal
losing his temper too but if i shoot
you now who is going to send for those
marines 

  wait a minute said shep youre
off on the wrong foot look at it this
way you take us to the general if he
wants to shoot us he can if he doesnt
hell call you a smart fellow

  there are too many spies around
objected the corporal

  what chance will we have to get out
with information if the general does not
want to let us go  just look at the facts
man here ill hand over my rifle to
show my good intentions and mine is
loaded

  the corporal took the rifle and looked
at it suspiciously one of the men in the
squad made some remark and they all
crowded around it chattering the cor-
poral bellowed to make himself heard

  be quiet this is a gun like the ones
we have been capturing from don mi-
guels troops these men are obviously
suspicious foreigners and it is our duty
to take them to the colonel americans
it will be very surprising if he does not
have you shot so you had better make
ready for it

with this complicated reconciling of
two points of view and two courses
of action everyone had to be satisfied
the corporal in particular seemed pleased
to have thought of it and hustled them
down into the city   
  colonel corotizo was having his break-
fast on a sunlit balcony when they were
ushered informally into his presence the
balcony ran along one side of the war
college and overlooked a large and dusty
parade-ground in the middle of which a
group of men were apparently trying to
put together a complicated piece of ma-
chinery the colonel watched them
dreamily while he drank his cafe con
leche and took an occasional bite at a
peeled orange which he held on a stick
he was resplendent in a pale blue uni-
form loaded with gold braid and he ap-
peared considerably annoyed at being
interrupted

  after a few incisive questions he was
convinced that tomas and jose were
exactly what they said and he ordered
them to return at once to their company
which happened to be one of his own and
which was stationed at the moment in
another part of the city recruiting the
losses which it had suffered he sharply
ordered the disappointed corporal to
leave him alone with the two americans
but to station one guard outside the door
and another under the balcony the
soldiers reluctantly withdrew shira who
had been overlooked in the general ex-
citement scuttled out after them ted
and shep remained standing they
looked at the colonel and the colonel
looked at them

  lets speak english said the col-
onel with a strong midwestern accent
i went to culver and ann arbor i was
a delt he regarded them inquiringly

  i was at yale ted answered
bones

  the colonel shrugged no matter
sit down how did you get here and
whats your story 

shep and ted decided without con-
ference that the time had come to put
the cards on the table they did not ex-
plain their mission in detail but said that
they had come into the country with the
assistance of senor alvaro the minister
to panama and gave a lively description
of their adventures since arriving

  what luckl said colonel corotizo
the minister is in bolto at the moment
he arrived on the last train before these
damn rebels seized the railroad you
will like to see him

  i dont think he will recognize me if
i cant have a bath and a shave ted
answered

  excuse me here i ait gabbing and
offer you no hospitality of course you

must have a chance to make yourselves
comfortable youll have to overlook my
bad manners ive got a lot to worry
me this damn revolution gets on my
nerves ive had the honor to defend the
government in four but this is the worst
one these devils are opposing us in
force theyve grabbed our railroad
were short of ammunition and to make
matters worse im stuck with a consign-
ment of machine-guns which we have at
great trouble imported from belgium
and not a man in the army knows how to
operate them

  i might be able to help out said
shep i was a machine-gun captain in
the last war i havent kept up with all
the new models but i think i could get
the hang of it

the colonel leaped up from the table
and rushed at shep as if about to
kiss him when he stood on his feet
they could see that he was little more
than five feet tall he seized sheps hand
and pumped it up and down in both of
his own his midwestern english de-
serted him and with it the brusqueness
with which he had spoken and lie flew
into eloquent and flowery spanish

  welcome of god it is a miracle that
has sent you to us you will come at
once with me down to the parade-ground
beloved friend you will forgive that i
hurry you but the enemy are at our
gates and we have no time to lose you
shall be a captain again consider your-
self a captain i will speak to the gen-
eral it is arranged -

  wait a minute colonel what about
my friend

  has he had any experience of military
affairs

  i went to a military academy

  the colonel was in no mood to quib-
ble over trifles you are a lieutenant
and special aide to the captain come
let us go

  wait a minute said shep again it
wont take me long to clean up but i
just plain am not going to take over a
new command while i look like this
but of course of course friend
of my soul you must have patience with
me again the colonel clapped his
hands and an orderly popped in to
whom he barked a series of orders each
one ending in hurry at the end he
paused collecting himself and seemed to
feel that he had shown too much en-
thusiasm you will understand that i
am perfectly able to operate the guns
myself it is only that my time is so
occupied with pressing matters

  shep manifested a courtliness of which
ted would not have thought him capable
that goes without saying colonel a
commanding officer cannot be with all his
troops at once

in record time shep and ted had
bathed shaved clothed themselves in
cotton uniforms which mysteriously ap-
peared from somewhere and which ap-
proximated a fit although sheps was
too tight and teds was too short the
colonel apologized for not having the
insignia of rank to attach at once but
promised that it would be forthcoming
by the next day by no means lacking in
shrewdness he had telephoned to senor
alvaro while they dressed gscribed
them and received a tentative confirma-
tion of their story he brought them a
courtly message from the minister who
promised himself the pleasure of seeing
them that afternoon as he understood
that they would be occupied with im-
portant matters during the morning
they started for the parade-ground but

ijets speak english said the colonel

 how did you get here and whats
your story

the colonel halted and slapped his fore-
head with his hand

  i am forgetting too much you must
be sworn in

  out of the breast pocket of his uniform
he produced a small silver crucifix which
ted and shep held in turn while they
swore to defend and uphold the republic
of parador so long as the present emer-
gency lasted the latter phrase was the
product of quick thinking on teds part
since he had no idea of finding himself
committed to years of service in the
paradorian army

  the soldiers around the machine-guns
and the young lieutenant in charge of
them had apparently given up over-
come by fatalistic resignation they were
sitting around in dumb and dark-eyed
silence while the lieutenant languidly
turned over some pieces with his toe at
sight of the colonel they climbed slowly
to their feet and gave some kind of sa-
lute corotizo announced to them that
he had brought them their new captain

jim
the blue bc

and lieutenant shep acknowledged the
introduction with a curt nod and bent
over the guns he knew that he had a
miracle to perform if he was to retain
his standing and he prayed inwardly that
designs in machine-guns had not changed
too radically since  he had looked
at all the new ones the united states
army had brought to panama whenever
he could persuade one of the officers to
give him a chance but he did not feel too
sure of himself within five minutes
however he realized that he had nothing
to worry about these guns were benet-
merciers out of the old surplus stock
they had been tough to handle at cha-
teau thierry and they were tough still
a thrifty belgium firm had evidently put
the left-overs aside bright and shiny in
their cases to sell to remote and easily
satisfied countries

  shep straightened up and began bark-
ing orders in a tone which brought the
men to attention in spite of themselves
and ted translated them turning occa-
sionally to the colonel for the correct
military term in five minutes activity
had taken the place of despair the
colonel turned on his heel and went
away satisfied and his cocky little figure
disappeared under the shady arcade of
the barracks

the young lieutenant moreno was
sent to muster out the rest of the com-
pany the soldiers sprang around with
an unimaginable disregard for the mount-
ing sun and ted stared in admiration of
a shep whom he had never seen before
gone was the languor the devil-may-
care expression the lackadaisical man-
ner this was an officer who knew his
business and intended to get the most
possible out of his equipment in the
shortest possible time the men instinc-
tively felt it and showed it by the respect
in their glances and the alacrity with
which they obeyed orders

  they sweated and maneuvered and
time after time went through the mo-
tions of bringing their guns into action
and firing until as shep said they could
do it without killing any of their own
men all the time they kept an ear
cocked for the crackle of firing which
would tell them that the battle had be-
gun again on the outskirts of the city

  step around there shouted shep
youve got maybe one hour maybe two
nobody knows how long to learn what
takes most soldiers six months were
going to do it so step lively

k magazine

  there was no pause for lunch-worse
still no siesta tunics had been discard-
ed wet shirts were sticking to their
backs and the hot red sun was throwing
a last pink veil over the snow-covered
mountains when shep finally stopped

  lietrtenant phillips report to the col-
onel that we are ready for inspection

  ted found the colonel on his balcony
enjoying a well-iced planters punch and
delivered the message word was sent
to the general to senor alvaro and
others in the brief wait which followed
ted had time to remember shira his
conscience pricked him as he realized
how he had let her pass out of his mind
after all the hardships she had endured
and the loyalty she nad shown it did
not make him feel any better to find that
no one had seen her or had the faintest
idea where she had gone	i

  there had been no fighting during the
day don miguel had not attacked
again no one knew why and the defend-
ers had decided to wait until their ma-
chine-guns were ready the third and
fourth regiments of the national army
were in bolto the fifth had been cut to
pieces in maladon the sixth had de-
serted to don miguel as most of its of-
ficers were relatives of his the seventh
was supposed to be on the road coming
to the support of the capital but had not
been heard from the first and second
were not mentioned because they did
not exist in order to make the army
sound larger they started with the num-
ber three the president and most mem-
bers of the government had withdrawn
temporarily into a place of safety in the
hills

  the inspection was an unqualified suc-
cess the guns moved quickly looked
impressive and made a lot of noise the
men were dismissed at last exhausted but
happy and told to get a good rest col-
onel corotizo said that a room had been
provided for shep and ted in the war
college where he himself was staying at
the moment

  confidentially said shep as he and
ted took a shower im not sure we
could hit the broad side of a barn thatll
come though thatll come

at a gala dinner in the officers mess
k they drank death to the rebels in
lukewarm champagne and shouted
 arriba la republica i

  shep who had not tasted alcohol for
weeks became very expansive and rolled
back to his bedroom with his arm around
anything might happen

teds shoulders reviving with an in-
credible amount of detail the fame of the
once young mademoiselle from armen-
tieres he looked at his quarters with
unqualified approval

 a real bed with sheets on it ted
this is a gentlemans war i thought
they had forgotten how to have them

chapter fifteen

shep was confirmed in his opinion
about the war next morning he
awoke to a sweet antiphony of church-
bells ringing all over the city it was
hard to believe that anything unpleasant
could be taking place under that peaceful
music he saw ted struggling into his
uniform

  im going out to see if there is still a
war on said ted-seeing shep was awake

  beforeted could carry out his inten-
tions however there came a knock at
the door and tomas and jose appeared
with clean and beaming faces

  capitan chip tomas exclaimed
grinning widely i am your orderly and
jose here is for teniente teed

  they shook hands all around with as
great a warmth of affection as if they had
known each other all their lives instead
of less than a week shep then told
tomas to find the colonel and bring
back the orders for the day and jose
was assigned to the equally important
job of discovering some hot water for
shaving tomas shook his head

  nobody will fight this morning it
is sunday

  can we count on the enemy to see it
that way 

  but of course capitan don miguel
is a very bad man but he is also a chris-
tian

  well just check it for me will you 
if were really having a vacation we
can get the company together for a little
more practice with the guns

  but capitan the men must go to
church too it would not be possible to
find them until after twelve oclock
im beginning to get it said shep
you take my message to the golonel
anyway

  by the time shep and ted had finished
dressing and breakfasted on the caf-
con-leche and rolls brought by jose to-
mas came back with a message from the
colonel he would be pleased to have
the americans join him for lunch and
after lunch the company would fall in

for more drill meanwhile he suggested
that the old cathedral dating from the
early sixteenth century might interest
them very much if they cared to attend
services there

  show me the way shep said i
dont understand all the rules but im
willing to play them

     ted announced that he felt it his first
duty to find shira after which he would
go to church if there were still time
meanwhile he hoped that jose had gone
to early mass because he would be re-
quired to help in the search but of
course jose assured him solemnly in
time of war it was necessary to keep on
the right side of the church-in case of
getting killed you see they went out
together into the crooked sunlit streets

  there was no atmosphere of grimness
in the beleaguered city here in the cen-
tral portion the ground was flat the
streets spread themselves out into squares
and plazas the pink and blue houses
beflowered with geranium and heliotrope
in the shade of eucalyptus trees there
was hardly a vista which did not include
a church built with a low square tower
to withstand the frequent earthquakes
and from every part of the city could be
seen the snowy mountains and a feather
of smoke curling in constant warning
from the peak of the active volcano

most of the population were in the
streets moving with sabbath sedate-
ness women passed dressed in decent
black the heads of the older ones bowed
under black mantas the younger with the
more coquettish lace mantillas they
tripped over the uneven pavings on high
french heels and the more important of
them were followed by little indian
maids carrying their prayer-stools

  one procession interested ted very
much the colonel was taking his fam-
ily to church he walked at the head
of them resplendent in his blue uniform
with the gold epaulettes and a plump
and placid-looking lady leaned on his
arm behind them came an extremely
pretty slender girl of about sixteen eyes
modestly on the prayerbook she carried
face shaded by her mantilla and with her
a boy somewhat younger in the uniform
of a cadet two little girls of twelve or
thirteen followed old enough to wear
mantillas but not yet graduated to high
heels and then a tall stark-looking wom-
an apparently a nurse or a governess
with two small boys strutting ahead of
her and the youngest clinging to her
 
anything might happen

hand a rabble of little indian servants
with prayer-stools brought up the rear

  ted saluted and stepped off the nar-
row sidewalk to let them pass the
colonel returned the salute but did not
stop for introductions

  the city was cut in three by two deep
gulches at the bottom of which little
streams trickled in the rainy weather but
which were quite dry most of the time
each gulch had only one bridge the
ancient monastery of saint augustine
commanded the approach to the bridge
over the second arroyo it had been
seized from the monks by a liberal gov-
ernment some twenty years before and
never returned to them since the order
had built for themselves newer quarters in
the mountains a huge seventeenth cen-
tury building of gray stone constructed
in the heaviest and gloomiest spanish
tradition its narrow slits of windows
were like the loopholes in a feudal for-
tress the indians till had fight in them
when it was built and it was intended as
much for defense as for habitation the
royal arms of spain were cut into the
stone above its heavy oaken door and
the great stone cross rested upon them
the arroyo was like a moat along one side

  id hate to try to pass this and get in-
to town said ted

  jose grinned they will find out that
it cant be done

  maybe they wont try it

  jose shook his head oh no would
the teniente believe it the men in don
miguels army get paid every week-the
men even not just the officers i know
because i have cousins in it and they
told their mother and she told me
but that is only for now when he
gets in they will be worse off than be-
fore

  yes senor teniente but who is going
to look that far ahead 

  ted started across the bridge the
teniente will not go here objected
jose there was fighting yesterday and
it is a poor quarter of town

  all the more reason to see what it is
like we may be fighting here ourselves
tomorrow

  jose shrugged and followed much as
he had grownto admire the teniente
everyone knew that gringos were crazy
this was a sample going to meet trouble
before necessary when one had only to
wait and trouble would seek one out

lively trouble indeed follows in the forth-
coming march installment of this novel of
south america

the able author of the fourth
officer and story coming up
gives us unother lively story of
 seafaring men

by

    richard
    howells
    watkins

  young captain carlsons hook-
  up with mike armour had begun
  in disaster and then petered down
  into acute and continuing misery
  captain carlson had taken seriously the
  duty of remaining on the bridge until
  the last man had left his sinking ship

      it wasnt much of a sea disaster any-
    how just the freighter alice monroe
    rammed and sunk in routine style by a
    passenger-ship making too many knots
    in a fog off ushant some weeks before
    the war started but carlson a con-
    scientious young commander had re-
    garded the collision with gravity

      i know my duty mister he had said
    to his mate you get that boat to hell
    away from here

      youre crazy as a bedbug the mate
   retorted but being a married man and
   knowing the captains gun was tucked
   in his hip pocket for emergencies he had
   lowered away

      in consequence of captain carlsons
   strong sense of propriety it was a long
   four hours later when he was picked up
   out of a choppy sea off a raft composed
   of hatch-covers gratings and other flot-
   sam the shipmaster was unconscious
   and had a knob the size of his nose on the
   top of his head

 
  his enormous rescuer mike asmour
ab carried carlson aboard the rescue
ship draped over a buttress-like shoulder
without much coaxing mike had de-
scribed how he had climbed to the bridge
and found captain carlson lying uncon-
scious with a cargo-block from aloft be-
side his swelling head as the alice set-
tled with ominous rapidity mike had



willi an angry snarl
the gianl grahlieil
carlson

jumped overboard with him and held
him up till the sinking of the freighter
floated off some stuff to hang onto

also aboard the wreckage was john
bullivant a taciturn dried-up middle-
aged seaman who admitted under prod-
ding that in trying to save his library of
sea books he had scrambled about too
long in the lightless forecastle

all this of course was fairly ordinary
-just plain-sailing sea grief the mis-
ery really started when captain carlson
came hopefully aboard his new command
the helen monroe after him grinning
swaggered tremendous mike armour
bullivant the forecastle reader who had
made a third on the raft followed but
was eclipsed by the towering armour

i promised this man a job as boat-
swain mr northrop young captain
carlson announced to the long and griz-
zled mate indicating mike

  boatswain sir mr northrop was
surprised we dont carry that rating

  captain carlson frowned we do
now he said

  mike armour looked down at the mate
and the helen with a belittling eye and
spat upon her iron deck behind the mas-
ters back during this brief contre-
temps bullivant unobtrusively lugged his
dunnage consisting mostly of books in-
to the forecastle and stayed there

  young captain carlson bore on his
arm a tightly rolled silk umbrella he
had read somewhere that masters in the
merchant service carried such things
and being above all a man who respected
his obligations he had carried this one
ever since they had given him a ship

  he was uncomfortably aware that his
new mate snorted in private at that um-
brella captain carlson liked to get on
with his mates but the mates low opin-
ion of the ceremonial umbrella-carrying
was nothing compared to captain carl-
sons drop in his esteem at barcelona
after the embargo kept the ship away
from the northern ports-but not away
from trouble

  mr northrop was engaged in dressing
down mike armour for coming aboard
drunk and playfully kicking bullivant
almost onto the anchor windlass while
it was heaving in the mate was angry
and he barbed his words of a sudden
mike armour picked him up and sat
him down hard on the drum of the wind-
lass bellowing his intention of grinding
northrop down to proper size it need-
ed all the mates outraged vigor and the
strength of bullivant to free him from
armours grip

  that mans got to go as soon as we
hit brooklyn sir northrop burst out
to the master i wouldnt sign him on
again for-

  captain carlson who had got as ruddy
as underdone beef cleared his throat
he had a feeling it was going to be hard
to get northrop to see his point of view

  its difficult for me to give a man his
discharge for a minor infraction of dis-
cipline after hes saved my life cap-
tain carlson explained

  minor- mr northrop was voice-
less only for an instant then he opened
up well sir he hasnt saved my life
and-

  im sorry mr northrop the master
interrupted i like to do the right thing
-the decent thing that people expect it
would be rank ingratitude he shook
his head ill speak to armour about
this myself

mr northrop swallowed hard
then emitted a resounding snort
he packed that snort with contempt de-
rision and insubordination reluctantly
carlson refrained from blaming him he
the old man was doing the mate dirt

but mike armour had saved his life he
couldnt throw him on the beach

  mr northrop limped away muttering
rank ingratitude he stalked past
bullivant who was leaning against the
well-deck ladder with a pained expres-
sion oit his face he was recovering
slowly from mike armours kick

  the mate paused bullivant had tak-
en a good bit of punishment in his ef-
forts to release the mate from mike ar-
mours inebriate clutch

captain carlson looked down on
the two somehow he didnt often
notice bullivant around

  it was luck you were standing by
when the boatswain assaulted me my
man mr northrop said approvingly

  bullivant polished the bowl of his pipe
in the palm of his hand he didnt lift
his head

  i often have bad luck sir

  bad luck snapped the startled
mate what dyou mean bad luck
bullivant raised brown eyes momen-
tarily in mild surprise i got a beating
out of it sir it was bad luck like you
said if i hadnt been there i wouldnt
have got a beating

  huh mr northrop glowered at
him then walked on   

  the helen with a mixed cargo in her
holds churned out to sea with mike ar-
mour standing over the men instead of
giving them a lead at the work as was
mr northrops conception of a boat-
swains job mike as captain carlson
observed unhappily seemed to be above
scrubbing with souji-mouji wielding a
paint-brush or even presiding over a
hose but his columnar form loomed im-
posingly or bellicosely on deck whenever
an officer turned his eyes down from the
bridge on the other hand bullivant
faded out of the regard of all men in
his watches below he read in his bunk
but when mr northrop checked up on
the middle-aged middle-sized seaman
he was always silently at work so like
the rest of the crew captain carlson ac-
cepted the mans habitual invisibility as
a character trait not injurious to the
ship and wished in silence that mike
would contract a touch of it

  only once did the mate mention bulli-
vant to captain carlson the shipmas-
ter nodded

a good man bullivant he said
still aboard is he i like that fellow
the mate exhibited surprise dyou
like him as much as you do armour

illustrated by cleveland woodward

tliat mans got to go as soon as we hit brooklyn sir

  i never said i liked armour mis-
ter captain carlson retorted stiffly i
said hed saved my life

  before the mate had time to probe
further the master firmly departed to his
office like armour you might as
well like an engine that had hopped off
its holding-down bolts

though the mediterranean was
kind the bay of biscay was crusty
a stiff southwester rolling up the narrow-
ing sleeve of the sea gave the helen a
shaking that set her- to squeaking and
jingling like a music-box the helen
took it stolidly enough only carlson
confronted with a slow start on the long
atlantic passage and the chief engineer
with fuel-consumption rising hour after
hour were disposed to take it otherwise
hard-working carlson knew that with
one ship of that line sunken under him
the office openly expected him to dowon-
ders with his second command out of
gratitude for the chance he did what
he could

  and then in a moderate gale shortly
after dawn the helen fell in with a
french fishing-smack which had lost her
mainmast and was rolling deck-under in

the sea her crew was clustered by the
still-standing mizzen with lines around
them she didnt look to mr northrop
as if she would last long he frowned
at her through his binoculars and called
the old man

  by the time captain carlson hit the
bridge mike armour was standing im-
patiently by the starboard lifeboat he
had discarded boots and oilskins and
awaited the command to cast off the
gripes and swing her out

  shes in a bad way captain carlson
said with glum conviction he looked at
mike armour champing to go and won-
dered if he were really doing the french-
men a good turn in letting loose this res-
cuer on them

  not too cheerily mr northrop called
for volunteers it was the mates job to
handle the steering-oar and he stood
ready to do so but not too softly under
his breath he wished these frenchmen
far far away it is quite a trick to get
a boat away from a rolling high-sided
tramp captain carlson knew that he
himself had done it as a mate

  come on boys roared mike ar-
mour waving his long arms whos
goin to swing an oar with me


the blue book magazine

  if he does swing one itll be the first
bit of honest work hes done in this
wagon said mr northrop

  the men were shuffling forward

  come on bullivant how about you
demanded mike armour

  surprisingly bullivant shook his head
not me he said firmly ive still got
a lame back from that twist that you
gave me at barcelona

  he jerked a hand to leeward be-
sides heres a cornishman thatll take
em off before we get a boat across to
em

  everybody followed fhe jerk of his
arm coming up through the grayness
was a black-hulled fishing-smack about
seventy feet on deck one of the pilchard
fleet by the look of her compared to
carlsons towering freighter she was like
a lifeboat herself under the drive of
her motor she sidled over the cresting
seas with an air of business-as-usual
though her sides were only a scant few
feet in height she rarely took water on
her deck she had been built for those
seas and the seas seemed to know it

  give em oil trumpeted captain
carlson in great relief get those storm-
tanks flowing mr northrop give em
a slick 

  he coughed and stand by that life-
boat he said as an afterthought

  mike armour raised an arm high and
cast his cigarette violently to the deck
then he leaned sourly against the davit
with his hands sunk in his pockets and
his eyes sunk in his head the other
men swept into action

before the big steamers storm-oil
had spread its restraining film around
the sodden frenchboat the little corn-
ish craft was close alongside her men
dropped nets overside and slung lines
down onto the afterdeck of the dis-
masted boat the frenchmen with their
lines around them jumped overboard and
were hauled up onto the fishing-boats
deck in jig time

  down on the well-deck of the helen
bullivant was quietly searching his pock-
ets for enough tobacco to fill his pipe
carlson inhaled air it was all over mr
northrop rang up the engines

  captain carlson chuckled as he pointed
out the placid bullivant to the mate
carlsons relief was giving him a talking
jag

  thats the kind of a seaman i tie to
mister he said hes no hero he isnt
heroes are twelve for a nickel at sea

with me anyhow some men are heroes
in a jam but cant stand up to the monot-
ony of doing their work day after day
like bullivant does im proud of that
man mister he doesnt want to get
drowned and he says so he does his
work and he dont crab about it

  mr northrop was too bewildered to
speak at this outburst of praise

  the young old man waved a hand
toward mike armour look at that toe-
dancing prima donna now gets drunk
ashore wont work aboard

  but-but-if you feel that way why
dont you kick armour to blazes off the
ship northrop demanded

  captain carlson frowned a leaden
weight dropped on him again the man
saved my life as i lay unconscious on the
bridge he said its a matter of no-
blesse oblige

  come again sir requested the mys-
tified mate

  noblesse oblige carlson repeated
he was somewhat embarrassed he
didnt like to explain his interior to this
hard-shell mate

  thats spot news to me sir insisted
the mate nobless-

  nobility ob-my position as master
mr northrop obliges me to act like-
with the highest motives

  well it may be noblesse oblige to you
but its applesauce to me the first of-
ficer declared stubbornly youre the
skipper if you want to kick a boatswain
onto the beach youve got the gold lace
to do it

  captain carlson was scowling over the
bridge rail at the disgruntled mike ar-
mour suppressed emotions flooded up
he spoke through his teeth if i could
just save that swabs life for him once
northrop i wouldnt kick him onto the
beach id feel free to break his neck
with my bare hands

  he showed the mate his hands knotted
with longing

  of course you would sir the mate
said soothingly he retreated to the other
end of the bridge too alarmed to snort

  carlson knew he was asking himself
whether he was chief officer of a ship or
of a nut-foundry nevertheless he fol-
lowed northrop to the port wing he
was still seething armours ruined my
discipline-made me a laughingstock on
my own ship he declared he stopped
himself he shook his head violently
and came out of it uh-mr northrop
i have a book on the st hilaire method
of navigation which i will be obliged if

hero hater

you will hand to bullivant with my com-
pliments i like bullivant

  to himself he added he doesnt go
round rescuing poor devils

  aye sir  cried mr northrop carl-
son guessed that the gift too seemed
screwy to the literal mate but at least
it wasnt violent from the bridge carl-
son witnessed bullivants reception of the
book the startled seaman dropped the
book turned purple in the back of the
neck as he bent and fumbled to pick it
up then he shuffled away with an over-
size embarrassed grin on his face

the westerlies were rampant on the
atlantic and the voyage to brooklyn
was no picnic the helen took the gray-
backs on the bow and thrust through
over or under them according to her
mood at the moment captain carlson
staggering through watch after watch on
mount misery meditated at length on
some method of restoring peace and quiet
to his ship bullivant had submerged al-
most altogether but mike armours
high visibility was rasping the nerves of
every other soul aboard her at times
captain carlson regretted having been
saved it was a raw deal for the helen
still the fact remained mike had saved
his life decency the right thing de-
manded that he be allowed to hold his
job wistfully young captain carlson
wished he could somehow save armours
life but how there he stuck like a
pig in a hawsehole he could do the
right thing the decent thing people ex-
pected could carlson but the mind of
a scenario-writer had been denied him

  mike armour was aboard when they
dropped their pilot off ambrose for the
next voyage aboard and roaring drunk
strongly liquored against monotony he
was aboard and roaring drunk too at
their farthest east an italian port this
time

  but he was not aboard when the helen
lay alongside a greasy white jetty with a
cargo of china clay in her holds her moor-
ing-lines singled up and a white breath
of steam curling above her rusty funnel

  captain carlson would not give the
word to cast off

  mr northrop had paid his usualvisit
to the forecastle and had uncovered three
bottles of alleged whisky in mike ar-
mours mattress he had cracked them
against the helens plates and carlson
hoped mike hadnt another hiding-place

  now on the river side of the bridge
the mate snorted as was his custom and

stared moodily at the tide rushing out in-
to the channel the pilot rested on his
elbows on the rail in comfortable calm
her hatches were on over the mucky
cargo twice mr northrop had taken his
stand on the forecastle head and looked
meaningly up at the bridge but captain
carlson struggling in a mire of noblesse
oblige would not give the word to cast
off

  the eyes of young carlson were glued
on the corner of the public house just
visible beyond the railroad sidings where
pint-size freight cars stood laden with
yet more china clay

  at last captain carlson took a turn
on the bridge which brought him over
to the mate

  if those two dont show within five
minutes mr northrop we get under
way he declared it isnt doing the
right thing by the owners to wait for a
couple of hands

  ill say the mate stated grimly

  captain carlson cast another look
ashore and his chunky figure stiffened
to rigid attention he was looking at
a lean seaman who had rounded the cor-
ner of the public house and was hurrying
over the rails toward the ship it was
bullivant he was alone

  breathing hard young carlson looked
past the hurrying sailor toward the cor-
ner of the red-brick building his gaze
was anxious yet hopeful

  theres bullivant he said i guess
he hasnt been able to round up armour
we cant wait for mike it wouldnt be
right to delay the ship would it mr
northrop

  the question was voiced in a plain gush
of relief mr northrop disdained to
answer it save by popping an eye

  its too bad about mike captain
carlson said with most unconvincing
sorrow

  its too bad we ever had such a trou-
ble-making swab in the ship the mate
retorted savagely

  captain carlson shook his head in not
too vigorous reproof v

  armour was always a good man
though hes got a bit out of hand lately
of course i cant ever forget how he
saved my life when that blasted liner cut
down the alice

  at such close quarters mr northrop
did not risk a snort but he did sigh wea-
rily and drape himself in bored resigna-
tion on the rail the captain still
watching the approaching bullivant
talked on


it was mo tliat lid most o tho
swimming for two capn cried
mike armour in alarm

  i have a proper feeling for custom
and the opinion of my profession in such
matters as standing by my ship mister
something heavy from aloft-she had
been been hit hard-knocked me out
cold  and the next thing i knew- have
i told you this before anyhow ar-
mour saved my life and probably bulli-
vants as well

  this time mr northrop risked a snort
and hes been plaguing the same life out
of you ever since he said in a rush of
emotion

  i like to do the right thing mr north-
rop the shipmaster said stiffly i have
done the right thing he added

  he nodded emphatically put away his
watch and leaped across the bridge to
address bullivant as the sailor reached
the saloon deck

  did you find armour

  john bullivant touched a hand ginger-
ly to a leathery but reddening jaw yes
sir but he said-he said hed come
aboard in his own good time

  what did you do about that bulli-
vant  captain carlson demanded

  as soon as i could break away from
him i ran sir the middle-aged seaman
replied

  captain carlson turned so abruptly
that he almost butted the lanky mate

theres something about bullivant that
i like even if he is a creeping coward
the old man muttered emotionally a
good man 

  he looked quickly even fearfully at
the shore once more and then became
decisive

  stand by mr northrop

  stand by sir 

  mr northrop blew his whistle and re-
peated the command in a bellow he hur-
ried down the ladder and at a gallop
charged forward to the forecastle head
the pilot rubbed his nose vigorously and
straightened up they settled down to
the job of getting the helen away with-
out removing the stern of a jap loading
at the jetty below them in the rushing
tideway

it took some time in spite of the fact
that captain carlson was now in a
prancing hurry to get clear of the shore
he had he felt right on his side now
he wanted speed

  they worked her out into the stream
northrop stood by the anchor and stared
with increasing good humor down the riv-
er as they rounded the bend and steamed
between high rounded green hills toward
the abrupt and narrow gash in the granite
coast that led to the channel on the


bridge captain carlson paced with a
jaunty step the festive air extended
also to the seaman on the well deck

  the pilot-boat came edging alongside
as they passed between the headlands in-
to deep water captain carlson rang
down the engines and shook hands with
the pilot bullivant below on the well-
deck had the jacobs ladder over the
side for the departing pilot and was
standing by

the pilot was halfway down the lad-
der when a stubby gray fishing-boat
with a heavy-duty motor came thudding
up astern

  captain carlsons eyes narrowed sud-
denly there was a man on the foredeck
of this squat craft a big man with arms
that looked as thick as cargo-booms up-
stretched above a bare tousled head it
was mike armour

  captain carlson stopped breathing

  armour leaped a gap of six feet to the
afterdeck of the pilots motorboat ran
forward on the craft sent the pilot twirl-
ing out of the way with a thrust of his
shoulder and grabbed at the rungs of the
rope ladder next instant he was bound-
ing up onto the iron deck of the helen
his movements had the blithe certainty
imparted by alcohol

  jovially he planted a hamlike hand on
bullivants chest bullivant went fly-
ing back against the hatch and fell with
loosened muscles he rolled over once
and stood up again without any show
of resentment he walked away

  armour hauled up the rope ladder with
a rush and waved a hand at the bridge

  report for duty capn he bawled
and a grin split his flaming red face

  captain carlsons features were thin
and taut but he said nothing he was
paralyzed mr northrop cursed he
marshaled his deck force and put the men
to work snugging down the cargo gear
against the choppy seas kicking up under
the urge of a stiff southerly breeze

  for once armour worked mightily
handling wires with happy ease as if they
were silken threads but his enthusiasm
waned rapidly of a sudden he wiped
his mouth and plunged into the forecastle

  mr northrop tightened his lips and
headed for the bridge ladder captain
carlson leaned far forward over the dodg-
er in the intensity with which he watched
the steel door through which armour had
left the deck

  a moment later the door swung with
a crash armour piled out again roar-

ing incoherently he stopped on the
steel deck with thick legs outstretched
arms hooked and fists swinging

  who stole my bottles he blared
come on you swipes whos been at
my bunk

  the gang had scattered and for the
most part disappeared bullivant had
walked down the port alleyway ar-
mours infuriated eyes swept a bare well-
deck and then lifted belligerently toward
the bridge

  this is going to be tougher than usual
sir mr northrop said between his
teeth any orders

  captain carlson cleared his throat
noisily before he could pick out some
words armour was bellowing again he
addressed the captain directly

  all ri somebodys robbed me
what you goin to do about that skip-
per  here i go savin your life and you
let me be robbed

  captain carlson darted a look at the
grim and unsympathetic countenance of
mr northrop it was plain the mate
wished he had gone to the bottom and
stayed there carlson himself spoke to
the infuriated giant on the well-deck

  you know the rules my man your
liquor has gone overside stand by to-
overside armour roared like a
gale and his arms waved like tottering
masts thats gratitude that is de-
stroy a mans medicine after hes saved
your shivering skin

  captain carlsons frown was apprehen-
sive as well as angry he had a delicate
balancing job to do-with the right thing
for mike on one side and the right thing
for his ship on the other

  get some men together and put irons
on him till he quiets down mr north-
rop he said in a low voice

  iron him sir mr northrop repeated
in bitter obedience gingerly he de-
scended the ladder

armour was charging across the
 well-deck but suddenly he stopped
with thick jaw sagging in thought

  tell you what he proposed with
heavy gravity give me my bottles or
back we head for more  his voice rose
again one or the other bottles or
back 

  his roving eyes encountered the un-
happy mr northrop on the lower bridge
with his whistle poised to summon the
watch

  so he roared thats itl mob
me hey ill fix you
  even as the mates whistle shrilled
armour charged the thud of his feet
set the ladder to trembling he came up
like a howitzer shell captain carlsons
fingers gripped the rail

  mr northrop stood his ground and
swung his fist with all he had as armours
jaw came within range but his knuckles
skidded along that iron jaw next in-
stant armour was level with him and ar-
mours fist sent him crashing back to the
house

  as northrops head cracked against it
carlson felt the world twirl almost as if
he had taken that blow himself north-
rop sagged to a revolving deck the taci-
turn bullivant responding to the mates
whistle took one look and vanished ar-
mour stormed past the fallen mate up the
ladder to the bridge

  the quartermaster at the wheel was
frozen carlson stood blocking the door
his hands were clenched but he kept
them down his level accusing eyes the
eyes of a shipmaster on his bridge were
the weapons with which he reckoned on
taming mike armour it wasnt the
right thing for a sea captain to use his
hands on a mutineer

  get off this bridge he commanded

at the last moment he realized that to
 the rushing giant he simply wasnt
there he braced himself desperately
but armour lunging into him knocked
him backward almost to the binnacle he
was up on his knees at once he wrapped
his arms around armours legs and
heaved mightily

      for an instant the giant tottered then
    with an angry snarl he kicked free and
    grabbed carlson carlson was lifted off
    the wheelhouse floor his clutch at the
    giants leathery throat failed by an inch
    armour heaved him over his shoulder
    turned ran to the bridge ladder he
    slung the captain onto the steeply in-
    clined treads

      battered clawing for a grip carlson
    thudded on down to the lower bridge
    he landed in a huddle groaned cursed
    and tried flounderingly to get up his
    nose was a bleeding wreck from the metal
    edge of a ladder tread

     thrown off my own bridge he
   raged s-satan

     a man nimbly descended the port
   bridge ladder sliding most of the way
   it was the quartermaster who had been
   at the wheel a pair of binoculars
   whizzed past his head and splintered on
   the steel plates of the well deck the
   man ducked ridiculously late and
   sprinted out of sight around the corner
   of the house

      carlson struggling to get on his feet
    stopped moving his eyes had been
    caught and fixed by a terrible sight be-
    yond the bow he shook his groggy head
    a stretch of the coast which the ship
    had been skirting was slowly remorse-
    

if its the last
thins i do said
carlson im go-
ing to tan your
hide for yon
lessly swinging into view-a huge tow-
ering headland

  well enough did carlson know that
chunk of cliff it was dead man point
it should be on the starboard beam not
dead ahead then he remembered the
helmsman there was nobody at the
wheel he could hear mike armour
stamping across the bridge over his head

  bottles or back armour stormed
ill take her back myself

for a single instant carlson met the
stricken mates eyes wilhin sixty
seconds he and northrop could get their
guns the junior mates and the watch
would be at his back the engines would
be stopped and mike armour would be
shot or overpowered

  but it wasnt the man that carlson
feared it was the situation he hadnt
those sixty seconds the headland was
desperately close the ship would be
crumpling on the rocks below the dead
man within less than a minute

  carlson was on his feet now no time
for a gun he croaked you-up the
other ladder get to the wheel some-
how ill- get going

  mr northrop crossed to the port lad-
der peered up saw no one at the top and
changed his furious rush to a soundless
tiptoeing

  armour the captain was hailing
from the foot of the starboard ladder
mike shes heading for the rocks
get to the wheel man

  wheel be- want me off the bridge
hey armour raged im in com-
mand-i am ill-

  to hold mike armours attention
carlson started pounding up the ladder
out of the corner of his eye he caught
sight of bullivant the seaman was shin-
ning up outside the cab on the port side
of the bridge swinging over the seething
water alongside he was climbing to the
deserted flying bridge above the vantage-
point taken over by mike armour

  bullivant would be safe up there carl-
son told himself fleetingly as he stamped
slowly on up the ladder toward armours
reaching arms it was an excellent hide-
out for one who was not a hero

  here i come mike  carlson ciflled

  on the other ladder northrop was cau-
tiously raising his head above the level
of the navigating bridge mike armour
legs aspraddle at the top of the starboard
ladder waved the captain to come on
youre goin to swim back skipper
he roared

  fleetingly carlson made out northrop
on hands and knees creeping toward the
port wheelhouse door the engine-room
telegraph was too close to armour
northrop must get to the wheel there
were solid chunks of matter in the wheel-
house that would serve for weapons the
mate crawled in toward the deserted
helm his fingers on the spokes for an
instant or two would wipe out that
crumpling menace so close to the ship

  carlson paused as armour lunged at
him northrop he saw got his hands
on the wheel carlson had a frightening
vision of the cliff looming high behind
his back and at thatmoment armour
lifted his head from carlson on the lad-
der and saw the mate at the helm north-
rops eyes were held helplessly by ar-
mours glaring regard doggedly carl-
son lunged up the last rungs he would
be too late

  above the giant seaman like an agile
spider leaping down his web onto a fat
fly bullivant suddenly swung into sight
he had a marlinspike in his free hand
he thumped it on the giants skull just
as mike lunged toward the wheelhouse

  mike armours sudden movement
spoiled bullivants aim but the steel
spike did some service on the side of ar-
mours head it knocked him out of his
stride he grabbed the rail

  bullivant cast himself loose from the
flying bridge he dropped onto armours
head and shoulders draped himself over
the man clinging with arms and legs
octopus-style

  instantly captain carlson came thun-
dering past them he stopped again at
the wheelhouse door

  hard left he shouted

northrop rose-flung himself on
the wheel he made it spin as the
world had spun for him half a minute
before the ship plowed on toward that
iron cliff and then sluggishly swung her
bow to port degree by degree and then
point by point she turned toward honest
gray water away from the devils stew of
froth and granite rock at the base of the
point

  the minute the ship had turned to deep
water carlson left the door bullivant
limp as a jellyfish and just as clinging
still rode mike armours head and shoul-
ders carlson jammed at his legs strain-
ing to throw him on the verge of top-
pling armours arms thrashed madly

  carlson dizzily made out the mate
measuring that big target northrop
the blue book magazine

was dreadfully deliberate about it he
ducked in under a swinging arm as thick
and hard as a shot of anchor-chain he
hit armour in the stomach not in the
chest but in the stomach

  armour doubled and went down with
carlson and bullivant sprawling over
him northrop too dropped down on him

armour was still struggling most
 of his efforts were directed toward
liquidating the silent bullivant who had
been jolted loose from his commanding
position to carlson it was like riding
an earthquake but slowly they flat-
tened the sprawling giant

  thought you could knock me out-
like you did the old man-in the alice
hey armour panted he jabbed an el-
bow deep into bullivants ribs a last ef-
fort huh i dont pass out-so easy
you swipe ill-

  whats that cried captain carlson
his knotted fist poised above the point
of armours jaw wavered and opened in-
to fingers he touched the place where
the knob on his head had been when he
came to himself on the wreckage of the
alice bullivant he gasped bulli-
vant knocked me out bullivant
what

  armour was pinned down but he could
still writhe-and talk

  it was bullivant-from the flying
 bridge-like he just pulled on me he
snarled viciously he socked you plenty
-with a spike said you wouldnt leave
in time he raised that egg on you-
he did

  the quartermaster came padding up
the ladder apologetic in aspect with a
bucket of sea-water the mate splashed
it over armours head taking his time
about it making a job of it though
still stunned by this news carlson swept
the quartermaster back into the wheel-
house with a petulant arm armour had
ceased to struggle-the alcohol had been
watered down too skillfully he merely
tried not to drown they eased up on
him

  so  said carlson he whirled around
on the silent bullivant who was grow-
ing as red as a setting sun armour did
the carrying but it was you who stayed
to boss the job youre the hero hey

  i bore a hand bullivant muttered
she was settling fast

  it was me that did most o the swim-
ming for two capn cried mike ar-
mour in alarm he just socked you
like i said 



  the young old man paid no heed to
him all his attention was focused on
the squirming middle-aged seaman with
the abashed countenance

  so said captain carlson explosive-
ly s-satan it was you bullivant
youtoere the hero who saved your cap-
tains life well then you sheepfaced
swab you red flustered coy disgusting
object you stop shuffling your feet and
tell me why you let this big ape walk
all over me for months with his hero
game 

  bullivant writhed his lean figure
twisted his eyes stared at his feet

  im bashful sir he protested faint-
ly i cant stand bein a hero they
give me a medal once-on a platform
he blanched and swallowed hard all
them eyes bein looked at-an all
that it-it was awful

  and i thought you were a man i could
trust said carlson with his voice shak-
ing ill bet a million you did have
a bad back that day we sighted the sink-
ing frenchman s-satan if its the
last thing i do im going to tan your
quaking hide for you

  you cant said bullivant and for a
moment he lifted his eyes to the ship-
masters face you cant sir i saved
your life

  and ship added mr northrop with
a gesture toward the cliff

captain carlson wavered on his
feet he put a hand to his dizzy
head then abruptly he plunged down
the bridge ladder

  wait  he flung over his shoulder at
them in a moment he was back in
his hands he clutched his tightly rolled
silk umbrella he raised this symbol of
the right thing of the decent thing of
what people expected of a shipmaster
over his head and brought it down vio-
lently over his knee it cracked and
broke he raised the splintered wreck-
age and shook it in their faces

  noblesse be blasted  he said and
hurled the broken wreckage into the sea
youll do your duty on this ship my
man or youll hit the beach heroes are
out gratitude is out what people
think is out my ship is in dyou get
it you disrated boatswain you dyou
hear me you invisible book-reading pos-
sible fourth mate rescue me again
either of you and you wont live to see
brooklyn

  you hear him said mr northrop
prayerfully

                 who wrote mooney moves around

         our detectives pretty assistant a
         girl nicknamed mickey was in the
         real jam for she was accused of the
         murder and the evidence was damn-
         ing and the chief of police was on
         the warpath detective mooney
         however knew how to deal with
         people-and evidence

complete in this issue

 
at sight of jerry mickey slopped startled then she laughed
to thluk she said of seeing you here


mooneys
in a jam

   by kerry oneil

          who wrote mooney moves
          aroundand other popular books

mickey always said the music
at the algerian moon was
just dandy under ihc slow
sultry direction of sixto mar-
chand it throbbed while she stepped it
made her dream of the languorous spots
of a perfect world

  how is it going kid said jerry
mooney as he paced with her nice
and easy

  i think that fat little sixtos an an-
gel said mickey and handed down
to us to give us some idea of how thingsll
be some day if we act straight and dont
get funny

  jerry grinned at this for all his big-
ness he knew how to step he did it light-
ly and with the unconscious spring of a
true dancer but then as he said any-
body could dance with mickey

  babe he said to her as they drifted
around the dim room it aim all sixto
its mostly you what you are mick is
floating moonlight

  its a wonder she said you dont
think of something like that at the times
you leave me sitting some place waiting
for you

  now listen he said when i do
that can i help it wouldnt  rather be
where you are than listening to some of
these boilerheads that get themselves in
trouble and want me to get them out
this is the first night in six outs that
ive had a chance to get my partydress
on mickey said almost always ive
got to start right from the office because
if i dont the next i hear of you is on
the phone and youre eight miles away
and still going

  anything wrong kid asked jerry
outside of what youve been saying

  i wish said mickey theyd keep
the door shut

  has somebody come in said jerry
anybody i know

  dont start looking around she said
but awhile ago i saw that party engle
you know from city hall

  that so said jerry but hell be
all right i know him

  listen said mickey its you he
wants mooney and nobody else when
he saw you he was coming right out on
the floor only jose stopped him

  jose was major-domo at the algerian
moon jerry saw him standing at the
far side of the room talking to a stocky
man who held a derby hat in his hand
jerry led mickey to a table and they sat
down in a moment jose came to them

  i am sorree he said it is the
police he will spik with you

  the stocky man was only a few steps
behind josd he nodded to jerry and
mickey and also sat down at the table
a little business he said

  i hope said jerry pash aint wor-
rying about me again

  hed like a few words with you said
the man

  here i am having a nice time jerry
said with a friend and now this
partys asking for a few words aint he
had enough words with me i can shut
my eyes and think back and there dont
seem to be a time since i started pro-
ceedings that i aint been some place
with iash and doing what youd call
bandying words

  anyhow said engle fingering the
derby hat there he sits over at head-
quarters behind his desk and wailing
for you so what say if we start


the blue book magazine

  jerry looked at mickey

  do you see how it is he said to her
this is the way they square off at me
do you think youd like to wait or
will i get jose to call a cab for you
ill wait said mickey if its not
too long

captain pash at police head-
quarters was sitting behind his big
shabby desk when jerry came in wiih
engle his attitude was the usual round-
shouldered one and his big beak was
thrust out like that of a hawk

  hiyah captain said jerry good-
humoredly here i am towed in once
more

  so i see said pash sourly i knew
engled pick you up somewhere

  dont he always said jerry the
boys quite a cop it gives me a thrill to
see him at work

  pash tapped the desk with a bony
finger

  what i want tonight he said is
not so many bright remarks and more
listening get that fixed in your mind
he continued to prod the desk-top with
the finger every now and then i get
thinking about you and im never sat-
isfied now and then you work out a
good thing but more often youre in
something that makes everybody here
at headquarters think theyre being
made saps of and they dont like to
feel that way especially i dont and i
want to say to you now that every time
you act that way i get the idea of turn-
ing the heat on and right now i feel
more like it than ever

  what you do is let things take hold
of you said jerry and you let them
keep hold what i do when i get jumpy
about a thing is to either do it or get it
out of my mind

  pashs eyes snapped venomously

  up to now mooney lie said weve
never got anything on you not that i
dont think there have been things un-
derstand but we havent been lucky
youve got a license i know that a pri-
vate dick so its legal for you to do cer-
tain things but there are some things
that aint legal for you or anybody else
to do you might get away with it in
philadelphia or baltimore but not here
and thats what i want to talk about
listen said jerry it seems to me
weve had this a couple pf times before
yes i know and i hope thisll be
the last one there are people doing
stretches in the state coop that havent

done half what youve got away with
that thing you did in the shallcross
case said pash was nothing less than
breaking and entering theres ten years
written down in the book for a thing like
that yes i know-as jerry was about
to speak-youve got an alibi we
havent got a thing on you but just the
same privately and inside we know
youre the jake that did it youve been
around a lot said pash and youve
seen how a good many things are done
and you know the police can pretty well
tell who has worked on a job by the way
its done and that leads us right up to
your door for the things we notice about
your jobs are-

  just a minute interrupted jerry
i think id better let you know im get-
ting a  ittie tired of this pash and be-
ginning with right now youve either
got to accuse me and book me in the reg-
ular way or youve got to shut up

  all right pash said let it go that
way but  want to tell you and its not
the first time ive done it youre not
fooling us any we havent been able to
make good with any of the things we
know about you but just the same
youre the party that was behind the
jobs and im telling you if you keep it
up mooney well get you in the end

  anyway said jerry its nice of you
to let me know

  listen said pash leaning across the
desk dont give me credit for anything
thats not coming to me as far as im
concerned-and the hawklike eyes were
as hard as flint-id like to have the
boys take you downstairs just to see
how much you can take

  all right said jerry i know about
that you say it every time i come in
but youve never done anything yet and
in case youve forgotten ill repeat my
regular come-back to it stick to police
methods that can be talked about in
polite society and remember while
youve been here a long time you can
still be shaken loose

  that said pash glowering sounds
like a threat

  weigh it out just as you want it
jerry said i always like to see people
make up their own minds he pulled
the brim of his hat down and added
and now if thats all there is ill be
leaving also its nice to have seen you
even if what youve had to say wasnt
very pleasant

  it wasnt meant to be i just wanted
you to know youd best watch your step


mooneys in a jam

if you dont youre going to stumble
and once we get you down were going
to load a lot of things on you

  jerry made no reply and after a little
more of the same pash said he could
go when he got back to the algerian
room he found mickey at a remote ta-
ble and with her was a chatty-looking
girl in a red hat

  this said mickey to the girl is mr
mooney and this-to jerry-is ada
fuller youve heard me mention fully
i know

  awful glad said jerry as he sat
down

  her boy friends in the bar consult-
ing with some one and i just happened
to see her mickey told him

  very nice said jerry and now
that were all here what say if we have
a few refreshments

 when the order had been given
mickey asked wfiat happened

  pash lias only one tiling to talk about
with me jerry said he tells me what
lies going to do sometime if  dont keep
listening when lie snaps his fingers every
time something happens that headquar-
ters cant handle he figures ive had
something to do with it and sends for
me

  he must be a terrible old prune
said mickey if it was me id get aw-
ful disgusted with it

  that wouldnt do any good jerry
said hes tough as a goat every-
thing but police routine bounces right
off him and hes always had it in for
me when i was on the regular cops he
kept me standing all the time

it must be terribly thrilling said
j miss fuller to be like you are mr
mooney ive often heard mickey speak
of you and to have a job in the office
of a detective like her must be absolute-
ly wonderful

  its no real place for a lady said
jerry sometimes the boys when things
aint going right come prancing hi and
start to carry on usually in those kind
of spaces i send mick out to see if its
raining or not but often they outsmart
me by starting their stuff as they come
down the hall at times like thst im
only able to reach for the brass knuckles
and get up from the desk some cases i
et wouldnt look too well in the books
ut somethings always got to be done
about them

  sometimes said miss fuller when
i think how the law is i could just hate

it take for example that thing that
happened the other day to that little
ethel codrey she said to mickey its
shameful

  whos ethel codrey asked mickey
oh mickey said miss fuller you
know her shes in that little cubbyhole
of a place near the merchants trust
building she has the office girls mend-
ing shop

  oh yes said mickey i know the
place fully but i didnt know her name
i often take things there

  that little thing said miss fuller to
jerry is one of the nicest softest-spoken
kids you ever saw and shes terrible
clever when a stocking or a glove goes
bad on you and you think youve lost the
pair shell fix it for you and itll look
as if nothing ever had happened to it
i never thought she looked very
strong mickey said

  shes not said fully and thats
not the worst of it her mothers been
sick this long time and theyve had a
terrible time getting along the party
that owns the building has a heart like
a paving-block so you know what that
meant as soon as they owed him some-
thing he was all for tossing them out
aint it a shame mickey said peo-
ple like that ought to have something
done to them

  not only has the owner a terrible dis-
position but hes got a party working
for him thats worse said fully and
its this party that comes around after
the rent he not only went to their
rooms and talked but he went to the
office girls mending shop and talked a
lot more he had the poor girl almost
simple and now said fully heres
the dirty part of it the girls mother
had a picture it must have been awful
nice because this little ethel says her
father had it and just before he died
he told them to rake care of it he said
sometime it might be worth a good bit
of money

  well this party-you know the one
that comes after the rent-hes one of
the nosey kind he sees the picture and
asks about it and then he brings in the
landlord and he looks at it too and the
next day the collector comes back and
makes a speech and says hell take the
picture and give them a receipt for all
rent up to date about forty dollars
and he said if they didnt want to do
that hed levy on their things and they
could go live some place else but
where that would be they didnt know


the blue book magazine

  that picture said mickey was
worth money-i can feel it was and
those dirty tramps knew it

  it was worth money said fully
and they did know it and they got
it and then do you know what this
man malitoff sold it

  who did you say interrupted
mickey she leaned across the table she
caught fullys hand and held it tightly
what was his name

  malitoff said miss fuller surprised
it tells about him in the newspapers
and i think hes an awful louse be-
sides owning apartments that aint fit to
live in he has a diamond business i cut
ihe piece about him out of the paper
she fumbled in her handbag here it
is she said as she handed the clipping
to jerry that tells all about it

   diamond-dealer malitoff - located
on the ninth floor of the middle city
tower  jerry sounded only the high
spots of the newspaper story  recently
secured a correggio long lost who had
it no one knew-one of the many ro-
mances of the picture game got it for
a song and we are given to understand
not a very high-priced song disposed
of at once the selling price is named
at six thousand dollars

  fully looked at mickey would you
ever believe anyone could be so filthy
she said

yes i would said mickey id be-
lieve that man would because ive seen
him do something even worse than that
jerry looked at her inquiringly her
face had gone white and her eyes blazed

  do you know this pretzel mick he
asked

  i mentioned him to you once or
twice but not by name hes the man
that lied my kid brother into jail
yeah said jerry

  he was in a crooked business and
my brother worked for him one time
they needed a car quick and the kid
stole one and he was caught tommy
was just a wild kind of boy and he might
have got off but malitoff thought
hed be mentioned so to stop anything
that might do he pinned a couple more
things on the boy

  oh mickey your brothers not-not
now- in-there said fully wide-eyed
yes he is he got five years
what a terrible thing that malitoff
must be said fully you wouldnt
think anybody could be so rotten
these parties always work with their
fingers crossed said jerry ive never

seen malitoff but what i know of his
record says hes pretty tough the first
i heard of him he was said to be smug-
gling diamonds in from europe i think
i remember two or three of his people go-
ing to federal prisons but he never did
shoeing how slippery he is hes prob-
ably been in other lines beside that
though not ever having had any business
that he figured in i couldnt say

mooney was taking mickey home
and she sat silently in one corner
of the cab he said

   thinking about the kid

   yes-a little

   dont get too deep into it you know
i mentioned we might build up a parole
in another little while we might have
him out

  to have him locked up in there
said mickey and with that coughl it
scares me

   listen said jerry hell be rid of
that when hes out a month or two
yes she said that might be so
and then it mightnt but anyway hes
not taking up all my thinking just now
who im going over is mostly that little
ethel codrey

  oh yeah said jerry he drummed
with his fingers uponhis knees that
wasnt such a nice thing was it

  couldnt something be done about
it isnt there some kind of law it
seems funny to me that jobs like that
can be put through and nobody say a
word

   it could be taken into court said
jerry but malitoff probably has
money and hed fight it this codrey
girl as your friend hinted aint got a
dime and i dont see how she could
win

   for something thats worth six thou-
sand dollars said mickey this peanut
gives them a receipt for two months rent
-and rent thats already worked out in
a little while maybe theyll owe him
more and then hell get them out of the
place anyhow

   the flavors not nice admitted jer-
ry reluctantly

  something ought to be done about
it said mickey if the police cant
mooneys in a jam

do anything and theres no law to cover
it something else ought to be tried i
think she said we ought to do some-
thing just sos wed feel better about it
well said jerry ive turned a few
tricks in my time when some clever par-
ty had the gate locked but things like
that being outside the rules are not
liked it just happened this is the very
subject pash wanted to see me about
awhile ago he was all worked up as
usual and said lies going to get me
im always scared of that old walrus
said mickey sometimes when he calls
the office and you arent in i wonder
what he thinks he is he sounds like
judge jury and governor of the state
when people make all that noise over
the telephone i lose all confidence in
them

   jerry lighted a cigarette and his head
sank down between his shoulders in a
way he had when working out a problem

  this malitoff attracts my attention
he said and i dont mind saying id
like to step in close and drum on him
just to find out what he sounds like
that matter of your brother aint never
been settled for either
k theres never been a chance to do
anything about it said mickey

  thered be a chance now jerry told
her maybe kind of nice too

  well said the girl and there was a
whip to her voice that made jerry lift
his brows if there is id like to hear it
and id like to help put it through
suppose said jerry we think it
over hes on kind of a spot right now
and maybe something could happen to
him

  they had reached the building where
mickey had her apartment and were
going in when jerry spoke again

  does malitoff know you

  ive seen him only once-in court the
day tommy was convicted

  do you suppose he saw you

  i was sitting among a lot of other
people

  all right said jerry he went with
her to the elevator and said good night

after shed gone up he stepped-into
l a telephone-booth in the little
lobby he dialed a number and when
the answer came said is that you
gootch

  yeah thats me said a voice how
are they coming at you jerry

  ok just now and things being that
way im thinking of giving out jobs

i

  right away i know you got one for
me said gootch but i hope it aint
a hard one like the other time then i
was scared

  never get that way advised jerry
always keep your head up and your
chin out if you do that nobodyll ever
say a word to you

  i hope said gootch ibis time what
you want is clever i like my jobs where
the brains are used mental work is a
pleasure

  so ive heard said jerry and
maybe we can fix this thing so you can
give the old head quite a work-out and
now give your best ear to this theres
a diamond-dealer in the middle city
tower name of malitoff hes on the
ninth floor have a look in there to-
morrow jerry then detailed the mat-
ter of the picture talk with him
youre a friend of the codrey family
tell him the situation just as it stands
try and soften him up appeal to whats
often spoken of as a persons better na-
ture and remember all the things he
says in reply if he stays cold keep
friendly with him but put the brakes
on and when you have finished with
saying how sorry you are leave

  it is such a nice assignment said
gootch ill be glad to engage myself
with it it has human nature i will
appeal to him i dont think-confiden-
tially-liell be able to resist me

  i hope thatll turn out to be so said
jerry but dont be too sure from
what i know hes a tough egg and that
kind dont give very easy anyway when
you finish with him call my office make
sure im there and then come in
jerry left the place and the cab rolled
him to a basement eating-house on fifth
street a man stood behind a short bar
he was bald had a pencil behind his
ear and wore a white apron

  hiyah sid said mooney

  hello jerry said the restaurant-
keeper what you sparring around this
time of night for

  a little business said jerry whats
the chance of getting hold of chubby
ill see said the man in the apron
he might be upstairs he spoke into
a telephone for a moment then he
nodded to jerry yeah hes there and
hell be down

  in a few moments a short round-faced
young man came in at what seemed a
private door

  boy he said to jerry this is whats
called unexpected whereve you been
the blue book magazine

 operating i aint put an eye on you in
 a month

   im still pounding around said jer-
 ry up and down and sometimes side-
 ways they sat at a table and jerry
 ordered a bottle of red wine id hoped
 id find you here he said ive got a
 thing in mind

   thats fine said chubby because
 im that close-picked  cant get any sort
 of grip on myself between ten oclock
 and now i roll eighty-five bucks out
 of my pocket and not only that but
 out of the neighborhood i always think
 that if you drop dough to somebody
  thats around it aint so bad youve
 got a chance of getting some of it back
 again but when they fold it up and
 carry it away its just a heartbreak
 often its so far you cant see it even with
 a spyglass

   they had emptied the first glass of
 wine and poured out the second when
 jerry said

   theres a party i want looked at
 somebody that maybe you know

   no friend admonished chubby
 nobody i ever buddied around with
 jerry

   no i wouldnt ask you to do that
 this is malitoff you know the dia-
 mond-merchant

   chubby brightened up at once

   oh yes he said sure malitoff
 down there in the big lower yeah i
 know him when sime and me were
 working together we had that place all
 set for a going-over but just then sime
 had to leave town theyd got something
 on him and he thought hed better let
 himself get cold

   what i want you to do said jerry
 is step in at malitoffs and see just how
 the shops laid out are you following
 me

   im right alongside said chubby
 cheerfully but you aint thinking of
 opening that joint are you jerry
 well in a limited way maybe i am
 but forget that what i want is a report
 on how the place works from hour to
 hour

   that would mean a daylight job
 then

   yes

    all right ill give it a good scouring
 ive got notes on it right now but may-
 be theres been some changes made since
 sime and me was figuring on it

   there probably are a great many
 jerry said so dont trust to any old
 possibilities he looked at chubby

 who was tipping up a third glass of the
 wine when do you think you can see
 me in the morning

   not before noon its best not to be
there too early in these things you got
to give them a chance to start seeing peo-
ple then they dont notice you so
much

   all right said jerry noon it is
ill be sitting waiting for you

when jerry entered his office in the
morning he found mickey already
at her desk

  i thought id be first he said
whats the idea of you moving around
so early

  well said mickey as this might
be a busy day i thought id get going an
hour or so in advance and it was a
good thing i did we had a visitor and
he was here before i was

  jerry sat down on the corner of her
desk and looked at her

  anyone id be knowing he said
yes that man engle who came after
you last night

   no said jerry surprised

  he was here and making himself at
home when i unlocked the door

  pash must be teaching his boys new
stuff jerry said giving them false
keys and things wfiatd he say

   at first said mickey when he saw
me he was surprised then he tried to
laugh it off but when he saw  didnt
think it was comic he began to get
tough

  he would said jerry thats the
old formula

   he was all for opening things up and
going over your papers but  woiddnt
let him and when he talked  sassed
him back and that said mickey
must have discouraged him anyway
after a while he went away

  jerry continued to sit on the comer
of the desk and he swung one foot

  pash wouldnt like anything better
than to pile me up in a corner and stamp
on me he said and look at the things
ive put right in his lap

   i hope said mickey this doesnt
change your mind on anything youve
been thinking about that business of the
picture


mooneys in a jam

  jerry sat looking at her there was a

uick startled way about her that he
idnt like

  you werent pleased with engle being
here were you he said dont let it
bother you people like him never count
for much

  do i look pale or anything said
mickey anxiously

  maybe a little off said jerry but
not much

  it must be i need more make-up
she said i thought as i was coming in
on the subway i hadnt taken enough
time

  she took her handbag from the desk
and opened it jerrys eyes followed the
movement there was always something
attractive to him in her way of doing
things he liked to watch her but this
time it was something else that held his
attention after the first moment for in-
side the bag nestled a squat hard object
a thing that had a black glittering sur-
face a small automatic pistol he only
had a glimpse of it for in an instant a
handkerchief was crumpled over it then
mickey took out a vanity-case and began
examining herself in its small mirror

  what say if we got this thing started
today he said

  itd be the thing to do she told him
as she touched her face here and there
itd be making it nice and snappy
not frightened or anything

  why should i be

  well thisll be a little different from
the things youve worked in

  all right she said i still want to
do it she laughed and then closed the
vanity-case with a click and put it back
in the bag the sound and the motion
made jerry lift his brows ive been
wanting a chance at this malitoff she
said and this looks like a good one
are you thinking about the kid
brother

  yes she said

  dont forget said jerry if we start
weve got to go through with it we
mustnt stumble any place we mustnt
have other things in our minds no mat-
ter what they are

  ill do what you want me to do said
mickey just tell me what it is

  all right said jerry he studied the
pattern in the office rug for a moment
last night i talked to a couple of peo-
ple it may be tilingsll break right and
we can start this afternoon

  malitoffs is a pretty uppy place
said mickey and if i have to fix up as

somebody more than usual id like to
know it now

  youd better make arrangements
said jerry so we can step into the thing
right away if we have to

  a half-hour had passed before ates
haley the office-boy came in his freckles
almost gleaming from a morning scrub
and his red hair alarmingly neat

  take charge said mickey to him
im going out for about an hour

mickey in a snappy little hat and
a tight skirt small bright shoes
and astonishingly good-looking stockings
stepped briskly down the street by and
by she went in at a doorway at the side
of which was a metal plate carrying the
name hortcnse there was a long
poorly lighted passage then came a huge
room in which hung an absolute wilder-
ness of womens costumes a large wom-
an sat at a table and at sight of mickey
she arose

  well darling she said i was think-
ing of you only a bit ago

  how are you nora said mickey
you look very well

  im all right mickey said nora
burns known to the used-outfit business
as hortense but i cant say that
you look as though you were you have
worriment written on the face of you
oh its not much said mickey
nothing at all i suppose

  what made me think of you said
nora was that the other day i saw a
piece in the paper about that wretch
malitoff isnt it the gods wonder how
such things are let happen him mak-
ing money hand over fist after all the
things hes done and then i thought
about poor tommy and then about you
and youve been in my mind off and on
ever since

  well dont think of me that way
said mickey just look at me as a cus-
tomer ive come in to hire a costume
nora

  i was hoping said nora youd
want to buy shoes only yesterday a
girl who is married to a harum-scarum
rich fellah sold me some things and her
only wearing them a half-dozen times
her shoes are so small i thought theyd
be a loss who has such a foot i said
to myself and then i thought of you
you could wear them mickey

  what i want is a gown said mickey
for maybe this afternoon or it may
be tomorrow or the next day i cant
say just when it all depends


the blue book magazine

  its an adventure said nora some
of that big fellah jerrys goings-on
im to be a rich girl said mickey
i step out of my own car and into a
pretty swell place and i must look the
part

  nora searched among the gowns

  i have plenty she said she selected
one here is class she said money
without end it belonged to a girl who-
but mickey waved it away

  that would go too far said mickey
i want one that looks rich but it
mustnt raise hell

  well said nora give a look your-
self you have taste darling youll be
sure to see something

  mickey moved along the line of hang-
ing gowns she paused here and there
and at length she pointed to one

  that looks nice she said id take
that if you could make it fit

  i can make any of them fit said
nora confidently i wasnt twelve years
with madame henri for nothing dar-
ling this she said taking the gown
from a hanger belonged to a strip of a
girl who makes a fool of her father she
buys enough clothes in a year to outfit
a dozen-and sells them almost at once
for pocket-money try it on mickey
and well see what must be done

mickey did this and while doing it
she talked with nora

  listen she said i came over here
to get a dress but besides i wanted to
tell you something

  well thats nice said nora be-
cause i see very little of you darling and
anything youd have to say to mell be
welcome

  i dont think this will be said
mickey its a thing thatll make you
feel jumpy

  what is it asked nora alertly

  do you remember that day in court
when tommy was sent to prison

  yes said nora and her eyes were
suddenly troubled

  after theyd taken him away said
mickey you and i stood in the corridor
do you remember why

  no said nora and there was fright
in her voice no i dont

  you do said mickey you do
nora but youre afraid to admit it we
were waiting until malitoff came out
i wanted to see him close so id remem-
ber him and when he did come out
and passed by and id had a good look
at hiirv do you remember what i said

  darling said nora its not good for
a person to keep foolish excited things
like that in their minds

  i said the time would come when
hed suffer for what hed done said
mickey more than that i told you
the ctay was coming when i-

  dont say it again cried nora
burns dont mickey she took hold
of the girl it was the distress in you
that made you say such a thing

  i know said mickey i remember
that you put your arms around me then
just as youre doing now and you made
me promise something

  i did said nora i made you
promise youd never step a foot in any

elace where that man was and you
eing a truthful girl darling i knew
youd keep your word

  youve forgotten something said
mickey there was more in that prom-
ise than youve said

  you promised me-

  i promised interrupted mickey
that id never go anywhere i knew mal-
itoff would be without coming to you
first and telling you i was going to
nora looked at her frightened

  you did mickey that was it dear
i came here this morning nora not
only to get a dress to wear on this little
office business but also to tell you the
place im going to is malitoffs in the
middle city tower

  noras face was white she released the
girl and stood looking at her

  mickey she said ill never forget
your words that day or the way you
spoke them it put fright in my heart
and that fright is still there you are
not thinking of that saying now darling
are you you havent such a terrible
thing in your mind

  one of our office proceedings said
mickey takes us to malitoffs its busi-
ness nora but as i made you a prom-
ise i thought id better tell you  was
going there		

during mickeys absence from the
office the telephone rang and ates
haley answered

  mooney proceedings said ates in
an official voice yessir mr mooneys
here whos calling yessir i know
everybodys business is private but you
tell what your name is to people dont
you

  put him through called jerry from
the inner office never fight with the
trade about anything but a bill


mooneys in a jam

  it was gootch who spoke in his ear
ok said jerry howd you make
out

  i have many small facts said gootch
also there is to report an important
conversation

  thats nice said jerry suppose
you run in ill be waiting

shortly afterward gootch reached
the office he was small neatly
dressed and looked like an armenian
and he smoked a heavily scented cigar-
ette while he talked

  i did not wish to speak to malitoff
too soon he said so in the early
part of the morning i searched for out-
side information at first it looked like
work that was easy but in a little while
i found it was not so there were
places where there was nothing

  blank spots said jerry i know
what you mean i keep running into
them myself

  as i searched said gootch i saw
there were places where hed done things
to cover other things up three times
i found hed changed his name but
there was once or twice more that i
could not be sure of he has been in
many things almost always things where
the shadow of the law fell on him pre-
cious stones were the things he liked best
he carried on an importing business
and never paid the customhouse a dollar
unless they found something out twice
the federal government had him but
could prove nothing always said
gootch it was someone else they proved
it on malitoff-admiringly-is clever
so ive heard said jerry

  what i have found out said gootch
is all along these lines the other
things what you call blank spaces ill
look into later if you think it necessary
lets have your talk with him said
jerry

  when he talks said gootch he is
cheerful and careful not once would
you think him a rascal he is smooth
like glass and hard i found that out
right away he smiled when i began
telling about the two women the young
miss codrey and her mother hieyes
smiled but deep down in them i saw he
was watching me and waiting he has
fine hands said gootch long fingers
with pointed tips and polished nails
they are the kind of hands people have
who work with diamonds and other ex-
pensive things and while i talked with
him he rubbed them together

  when they do that said jerry i
always get extra careful

  it is a sign said gootch it tells
you they are aware they are meditating
they are examining every word you say
the man told jerry hed opened his
talk by explaining to malitoff how the
girl and her mother happened to have
the painting he told them of the dying
father-of how that father had told them
to treasure the painting because it was
not only beautiful but valuable but
they were innocent they knew nothing
of such matters even when they were
bitterly poor the picture never came in-
to their minds they suffered grievous-
ly and all the time unknowingly had
this thing of price in their possession

  all the time while i told of these de-
plorable situations said gootch this
man smiled and rubbed his soft hands
together but when he spoke his words
were the words of a man who had no
pity he was a business man he said
that to me while i stood wiping the
tears from my eyes you know my tem-
perament i had been so affected by the
words id said that i wept as a business
man he said he always worked in a
business way where there was a profit
he always tried to get it in no other
way he said would he be doing himself
justice

  and then what asked jerry

  i could not move him said gootch
he had made a nice deal if someone
suffered how could he help it it was
not his fault he told me that and
smiled when he said it and so when
i saw it was no use i left him

  all right said jerry i thought it
would be something like that but i
wanted to give him a chance

gootch had departed when the tele-
phone rang again it was chubby
ive looked at the shop chubby said
also ive asked a few questions here
and there in places i know and im
all ready to give

  where are you

  downstairs in your own building
  run along up said jerry

  chubby when he came in looked
quite cheerful

  what this does to me is make me feel
good he told jerry like old times
when me and sime were getting some-
body ready

  were you in the shop

  yeah i walked around and exam-
ined a few small things they looked


the blue book magazine

at me a couple of times me not being in
the class that they mostly see there and
to keep them oft me i got one of the
salesmen aside and hinted that  knew
where they could buy a little ice at a
low figure of course he said no they
only bought in the regular places-which
was a laugh to me though  didnt do it
out loud

  what did you see that id want to
know said jerry

  the place is just about like it was
when sime and me looked at it there
are six people there not counting mali-
toff all of them are the kind youd ex-
pect to see working in a place like that
except the doorman hes got two thick
ears looks like hed been belted around
in a ring a good bit at some time

  hes probably there to handle any
trouble they might have

  thats what  thought but im go-
ing to look him up said chubby i
like to keep the run of parties like him
sometimes its useful he looked at
jerry in silence for a moment and then
he said i dont know what youve got
in your mind about this place but its
got tables where you sit down and look
at jewelry or stones and any of themd
be a nice place to leave a button if
youre thinking of that

  im not sure said jerry not yet
he looked at chubby for a moment
what did you pick up outside

  theres always guys who keep their
eyes on the trade said chubby and
i talked to a few of them kind of on
the side you know not letting on i
was meaning anything in particular was
malitoff doing a good business did he
sell good stuff was he pushing any-
thing just now anything he thought
was tops and i find said chubby
that hes got a ruby that lies holding at
twelve grand

  a ruby said jerry

  it must be awful nice said chubby
because thats a real price the thing
is what you call a burma ruby and
thats supposed to be the kind people go
nuts about

  sounds good said jerry it might
be worth reaching for

  there was a pause then chubby said
listen jerry no kiddin-whatre
you letting yourself in for this aint
just a crooked job is it

  no said jerry you ought to know
that

  because said chubby id hate to
see you turn mooch

  so would i said jerry but dont
get nervous what im going to try is to
get something back that this malitoff
took from someone else

  o k said chubby i thought it
mustjbe something like that but listen
look out for pash i hear hes been ask-
ing questions about you and i know hed
like to get you down

  jerry grinned

  there aint been a day since i opened
this office that hes not done something
along that line he said but he dont
step fast enough pash and his boys are
all right at bulldogging but real refined
works over their heads

malitoffs in the middle city
tower was a gleaming sort of
place the lights shone determinedly the
iloors glittered the showcases shot their
hard rays everywhere the chairs tables
and wall-panels reflected every movement
in the place the attendants were well-
mannered and suave anti toward noon
when the doorman swung wide the door
to admit a large young man carefully
dressed and with a heavy rather pon-
tifical manner only one salesman ap-
proached the others standing at a dis-
tance with polite attention

  can we serve you sir said the at-
tendant

  the big young man leisurely drew off
his gloves

  this morning he said in a voice
even more pontifical than his manner
im looking for some unset stones

  the salesman indicated a seat at a
table but the young man preferred an-
other

  the light here is better he said

  diamonds perhaps sir

  but the big young man hung his stick
on the edge of the table and looked
bored

  no he said im tired of dia-
monds id like something with color
an emerald maybe or a ruby

  quite so sir said the salesman

  in a few moments he had a tray of un-
set emeralds of good size on the table for
the patrons inspection the young man
handled them indifferently they did not
appear to be at all to his liking


mooneys in a jam

  ive been seeing stones just like these
for a long time he said what im
hoping to see is something different

  yes sir said the man i under-
stand

  he removed the tray and in a few
moments returned with another but
the interest of jerry mooney was no
greater than before

  what youre doing is not exciting
me he said these have more size
but they are du -looking he motioned
languidly with one of his big hands
i warn you lie said that im hard to
please another thing maybe emeralds
are not at the top with me this morning
a ruby might come nearer the spot
ive noticed that the fire of a ruby some-
times stimulates me it wakes me up
so what do you say if you show me a
ruby or two

  if you are considering stones of a
higher price- the man was saying but
another movement of the big hand
stopped him

  i said nothing about price said jer-
ry if you have a stone that might
please me lets see it i think what i
need this morning is to be startled

  yes sir just a moment the at-
tendant took away the tray and he re-
turned with a man who had a cheery
face round and with soft long-fingered
hands

   this is mr malitoff sir said the at-
tendant

  mr prawn tells me you are looking
for a fine ruby said the proprietor
well sir you are very fortunate for at
this time  have in my collection the
highest quality stone of that character
i have seen for several years to have
the gem-with a cheery smile-and the
person who will appreciate it is always
the merchants hope prawn-to the at-
tendant-have the small safe opened
and get out the burma ruby

  the man proceeded to do as directed
and in a few minutes a big stone in a
silken nest was produced it blazed on
the table before jerry in the cunningly
placed lights it had a notable aspect

  there is no stone in the city that i
know of said malitoff and i make it
a point to keep posted  such things-
that could hold a place against this one
its natural quality makes it an admira-
ble gem but the manner of the cutting
gives it added importance it was
thought years ago that gem-cutting had
then reached its highest development
but we hgve since found-with the same

cheery smile-that a newer generation
had something to add

   jerry hovered over the ruby not touch-
ing it but shaking his head impressed

  a very nice piece he said a rare
chunk of stone i think i like it

  take my word for it said the gem
merchant it is an exquisite adornment
or it would make a cabinet piece with-
out a peer youd go far sir before
youd find its equal at the price

   but at the mention of price jerry ges-
tured impatiently

  i think he said id like to see a
few other stones-also rubies-alongside
this one very fine ones i always be-
lieve in playing one thing against an-
other

  a tray of rubies was placed upon the
counter they seemed excellent stones
but jerry regarded them with disapproval

  havent you some closer to the top
he said with more stuff in them
these seem to have been cut for size and
like most stones so treated are mostly
aluminate of magnesium-quite soft and
unlike the true corundum gem

  jerry had spent an hour poring over
an article in an encyclopedia dealing
with precious stones and he had an ex-
cellent memory malitoff looked at him
and then at prawn

  take these away he said and
bring the tray from the inner compart-
ment

   yes sir said prawn

   bring said jerry impressively some
real pigeon-bloods and as the attend-
ant went to the safe the young man
looked at the proprietor when youve
once had a look at a real kyat pven
stone any other kind looks shabby
quite true sir said malitoff i
agree with you

the man brought another tray but
jerry keeping quite close to the book
went on talking

   inferior stones have fluid cavities and
in those you see enclosures of minerals
not corundum rubies like those are
no better than garnets for purposes of
exhibition asserted jerry impressively
they are not nearly as good as the ruby
of chemistry made with an oxyhydrogen
blowpipe

   i can plainly see said malitoff that
you know your rubies but here are
some stones with which the burmese
gem may actually be compared

  his hand went automatically to the
silken nest in which the big ruby had

the blue book magazine

rested since it had been taken from the
safe but it was not there the mans
brows lifted his face went a sudden
dirty white but jerry mooney was still
talking

  these he said hovering over the
newly brought tray are fair and i think
they prove what ive been saying i dis-
like mentioning price but to finish up a
transaction it must be done and so-
the face of prawn the clerk was rigid
the burma stone he said mr
malitoff have you it

  jerry looked at the empty nest
maybe he said quietly to prawn
you put it in the tray you just took back
to ihe safe

  look said malitoff to prawn and
look carefully

  as prawn turned to the safe agitated
he signaled the doorman at once the
man threw an electric control and the
big doors were fast locked malitoff was
breathless his delicate hands shook

  no one he said shall leave until
the stone is found he stared at jerry
it was here a moment ago directly in
front of you things do not vanish of
themselves you know

  jerry gazed at him

  listen he said if i were you id
keep at least one foot on the ground
that sounded a good deal like something
i dont care for there are other people
here in your place-and he indicated
a half-dozen persons who had been ex-
amining articles in other parts of the
room these were looking toward the
center of disturbance startled and con-
cerned they can hear what you say
if you make any charges against me
dont forget that the courts are still open
and doing business and people often
collect damages in them

  here prawn turned from the safe
the stone is positively not here he
said

  call the police said malitoff at
once and then as prawn touched a
button in the wall the proprietor said to
jerry the lock is on the door the
officers will be here in a few minutes
you cant frighten me sir this is not
the first time ive been placed in this po-
sition it is you who needs to be afraid
of the courts not i

  in a very little while the police were
knocking at the door and with them was
engle the plain-clothes man who had
picked jerry up at the algerian moon
the night before and he listened with
popping eyes to malitoffs story

  well he said as he stood his derby
hat on one side and a cigar in his mouth
looking at jerry will pash be glad to see
you or wont he

  with a disposition like his said
jerry all out of shape that way he
will

  brother said engle hed rather
put a real tight hand on you than on ten
grand thats just how much he thinks
of you

  he called headquarters and in a mo-
ment had captain pash

  hes just as pleased as hell said en-
gle as he put down the telephone and
now-to jerry-lets see what you got
on you -take him into one of those of-
fices he indicated a row of rooms
well go over him real good

  jerry was taken into malitoffs office
and stripped every article of clothing
was gone over with the greatest care but
with no result

  how could you find anything sug-
gested jerry easily as he pulled his shirt
over his head when there wasnt any-
thing there but if you were a good cop
-this to engle-youd start now going
through some of these other parties
all right smart guy said engle
were not done with you yet -take
him away he said to the policemen ill
be right after you

  when jerry had finished dressing he
adjusted his hat at the angle he liked
and he hooked his stick over his arm

  lets see that said engle he took
the stick twisted at the hooked end and
the ferrule to no purpose after eying it
suspiciously he returned it youve got
the stuff some place he said

  what you want to do is stop being
impulsive jerry told him you listen
to pash so much youre beginning to act
a good bit like him

it was at exactly twelve-forty-five that
a car drew up before the middle city
tower and mickey got out-mickey
dressed wonderfully and carrying herself
with an air and a few minutes later
she was entering the shining rooms of
malitoff dealer in gems

  madame said prawn as he came
forward
mooneys in a jam

  under the plentiful lights mickey was
beautiful her costume was beautiful she
gave off an air of wealth of place of re-
served remote class she loosed a won-
derful fur neckpiece and sat down at the
table where jerry mooney had sat an
hour or so before

  i want to replace a lost stone in a
setting she said a diamond she
took a small clasp out of her handbag
which she permitted to lie open in her
lap the stones are cut in peculiar
shape and i have not been able to dupli-
cate the missing one but ive been told
that you might have one that would an-
swer

  prawn took the clasp and examined it
through a glass which he screwed into his
eye as he was doing this mickey leaned
against the table one of her hands was
feeling under its edge while she looked
at the man with the glass the search-
ing fingers of the quietly moving hand
touched something under the projecting
top it was something soft-a button of
gum and pressed tightly into it she felt
a stone instantly she detached both the
button and the stone and slipped them
into a handkerchief which was in the bag
on her lap

  im afraid said prawn we have
nothing cut like this as youve said
madame its a character of cutting that
is most unusual

 mickey received this coldly

  possibly she said the proprietor
might be able to make a suggestion

  prawn removed the glass from his eye

   if youll pardon me he said i will
speak to him

  mickey arose her eyes followed him to
the far end of the room where she saw the
name malitoff upon the door

  at a showcase some little distance
away there was a girl holding a small
black spaniel in leash she had been look-
ing at something in the case and as
prawn started down the room she had
said to the attendant who also stood at
the case

  no do not bother to get it out now
tomorrow i will come again with my
husband perhaps he will likeu it
is very beautiful

  they came down the room the little
black dog moving before her prawn
was going into malitoffs office as the
girl arrived at the place where mickey
stood and what seemed like a sudden
move on the part of the spaniel caused
her to stumble she caught at mickey
for su

  oh please pardon me she said as
she recovered her balance this little
dog of mine does such very unexpected
things

  mickey made no reply she stood quite
still her face set her eyes fixed upon
the door of malitoffs office the girl
with the dog passed on and out of the
place and in a moment or two more
prawn returned

   if you will come this way he said to
mickey mr malitoff will see you he
led her to an office next malitoffs
where a communicating door stood open
please be seated said prawn hell
be with you in a moment or two he
closed the door leaving mickey alone

  there were only a few patrons in the
salesroom they were sitting at tables or
standing at the cases examining pieces
of jewelry only an hour or so before
the place had been in a turmoil the po-
lice had been there the doors had been
locked those patrons then present had
been detained despite their protests but
now a quiet had settled over everything
the thick rugs deadened what movements
there were voices were hushed to a gen-
tle murmuring

and then suddenly a high sharp
l sound-a pistol-shot the unex-
pectedness of it its blasting explosiveness
split the quiet in a frightening way and
then a second shot

  a woman patron screamed one of
the salesmen possibly with the incident
of a little while before still in his mind
called out to the doorman who instantly
threw the fastenings upon the exit feet
thudded upon the floor excited voices
lifted the shots had come from the
offices malitoffs door was thrown open
and there was a swift crowding into the
room the proprietor was huddled up-
on the floor beside the desk as though
hed slipped stricken from his chair a
few yards away stood mickey her face
set her hands clenched staring at the
prostrate form

  and at about this same time jerry
mooney sat at the desk of captain pash
at headquarters there were a number
of uniformed men in the room and
pash his chin thrust out was talking in
his sharpest and most accusing tones

  you walked into that place he
yelled just like you walk into every
other place and right away something
happens

  maybe said jerry it would be as
well not to go so far when you say


the blue book magazine

every place aint you bearing down a
little too hard on an old pal

  you go into malitoffs and ask to see
the finest item he has-a burmese ruby
worth an armful of dough and in a few
minutes the stone disappears-right un-
der their noses both malitoff and one
of his clerks were standing right there
but you got away with it

  now wait said jerry dont lets
get ahead of the facts you try to pin
this thing on me just because i was there
when it happened dont forget mali-
toff was also there

  the stone was malitoffs property
said pash a man dont steal what al-
ready belongs to him

  now listen said jerry youre a
cop thats had experience dont let
yourself go on record saying a thing like
that dig around a little how many
cases do you know of where parties got
the idea theyd like to collect some insur-
ance jerry tilted back in his chair
before you get me down and start
stamping on me why dont you take a
look into malitoff the boy might have
a record

  pash glowered on him

  you talk nice he said but keep
this in mind youre not going to talk
yourself off this spot he pointed his
bony finger at jerry what were you
doing in that place looking at expensive
jewelry is business so good with you
youre going to start collecting rubies
what i wanted grinned jerry was
a little relaxation you know id begun
to feel all tightened up and had started
to worry when  get that way i like a
place where they show prosperity see
what i mean a place i can go into and
sit down and make believe im in the
chips

  the next thing i expect to hear
pash said with derision is that youve
got yourself a bean-bag and are playing
catch out in the alley

  thats one i never thought of said
jerry but ill keep it in mind
first said pash with relish im go-
ing to slate you and when they get
here with the rest of the facts well start
puting the pressure on

rtheres another thing that wont
 stand up said jerry what do you
mean by the rest of the facts what
facts have you got i dropped in at
malitoffs for a pleasant half-hour look-
ing and asking prices a kind of win-
dow-shopping only carried higher up

while im there a valuable stone is
missed no one saw me take it when
i was searched i didnt have it where
does that get you if you went to the
d a with a group of facts like that hed
laugh s-loud hed get the stomachache
we aint going to let you be the judge
of that said pash

  thats all right with me said jerry
genially but dont forget youre not
going to judge it either friends of
mine are passing a few words in the
d as office right now also some oth-
er-items of that kind are being looked
after youll find captain ill be walk-
ing out on my word to appear when
wanted afterward maybe ill be asked
to give bail but i dont think so

  pash glared at him he looked like an
old cat whose prey was being taken from
it and just then the telephone on his
desk began to ring he picked it up and
yelled

  what do you want

  there was a mumbling at the tele-
phone captain pashs gaunt face was
stiff with sudden attention

  wait say that again and say it
slow a grin came upon his face as he
listened and his eyes turned upon erry
with a gleam of satisfaction in t lem
and finally when the voice ceased he
said o k have the party brought in
and you get over here yourself as soon
as you can

  he put down the telephone and he
planted both elbows on the desk and
stared at jerry

  i know he said youve got friends
who usually can do things but listen
fellah theyre not going to do much in
this case he wagged his bony fore-
finger at the young man i said id get
you sometime when id have enough to
indict you and now ive got it

  jerry as he looked at the face staring
into his own a face full of satisfaction
and almost savage triumph felt a sud-
den stoppage in his nerve-centers
mickey something had happened she
had gone to malitoffs to get the ruby
she had been detected she had been
arrested she was even now on her way
to headquarters there was a rising
clamor in his mind a roaring in his ears
but his expression didnt change he sat
looking amiably at captain pash appar-
ently quite undisturbed

  somethings happened he asked

  something only tells a little of it
said pash grinning he was still point-
ing his big finger at jerry the dia-


mooneys in a jam

mond-dealer malitoff was murdered in
his office about fifteen minutes ago and
that girl who works in your office has
been arrested for it

jkiuiy mooney spoke into the telephone
to steve curren of the district attor-
neys office

  i dont know much about it steve
he said the headquarters man who
telephoned in hasnt reached here yet
but from what they tell me this mali-
toffs been killed and mickeys been ar-
rested

   as the killer asked steve astonished

  yes of course the whole thing is as
screwy as hell but the police always
want their way in these things

  she hasnt been brought in yet

  not yet

  youd better have your own attorney
there

   ive thought of that but pash wont
listen to it hell not let me call him

  all right said steve ill get him
for you downs or burgess

  get me downs hell know this kind
of a trick better than burgess

  and ill see you myself said steve
curren

  good kid said jerry and he put
down the phone

  youll find said captain pash that
talking to attorneys is going to do you
no good youd better sit down and let
things take their course now that weve
got a chance to go over you were not
going to let it go by without making use
of it you may depend on that mur-
der you know is a thing that gets a lot
of attention-and youre right in the mid-
dle of this one he checked the counts
off on his fingers you go into malitoffs
place and are accused of stealing a val-
uable ruby also youre arrested about
an hour later this girl a friend olyours
appeals in the place and malitoff is
killed what was she doing there did
her errand have anything to do with the
robbery are the business of the ruby
and the killing of malitoff separate jobs
or are they one until thats made clear
were going to have a pretty free hand
with you pash nodded his head and
looked exultant theres a lot of things

youve been keeping to yourself for some
time that were going to hear about now
-things having to do not only with this
case but with some others

  the telephone rang once more

  yes said pash into the transmitter
and then all right let him come in
engle entered a few moments later
and when he saw jerry he laughed

  still here he said well this is
one rap youre not going to duck

  dont waste your time guessing said
jerry as he leaned against the captains
desk dont you see pash is watering
at the mouth hes so anxious to get his
teeth into what you know

  its as clean a case as i ever handled
said engle at a sign from the captain
everything fits like the works of a clock
the girl comes into the place at about
twelve-thirty one of the men named
prawn waits on her she wants a stone
to replace one thats been lost but it
seems they didnt have one that would
do then she asks if she can see the
proprietor malitoff prawn takes her
into an office next to malitoffs to wait
and he leaves her there for a couple of
minutes there are two shots the
people of the place run into the office
malitoffs on the floor the girls stand-
ing almost beside him the door be-
tween malitoffs office and the one shed
been in while waiting is open

  the gun said pash what about
the gun

  that was the first thing we looked
for said engle but we couldnt find
it

  have you searched her

  right away she didnt have it her
handbag was on the floor it had a vani-
ty-case in it a handkerchief a cigarette-
case a bill-fold with four one-dollar bills
in it and some small change

  noihing else

  nothing

  jerry mooney leaned against pashs
desk he was seeing that same handbag
as hed seen it quite early in the day
when mickey had opened it in the office
he saw the small shining wicked-look-
ing automatic that lay in it again he saw
her draw the handkerchief over it

  he tried to think of what had hap-
pened at malitoffs he pictured mickey
beautifully dressed bright-eyed and
charming seated before the table where
he had been sometime before he saw her
talking with one of the salesmen and
while she talked she drew off her glove
leisurely with no haste her hand moved
the blue book magazine

along under the tables projecting edge
to the place where the ruby was em-
bedded in the lump of soft gum she
had it-in her handkerchief he had
gone over the whole proceeding with her
a dozen limes the next thing hed told
her to do was arise and her getting up
was the cue for cora and he saw cora
some distance away small dark with the
little spaniel on a leash

  but with that the film moving across
his mind stopped    pictures were in-
his mind to be sure but of the auto-
matic gun in the handbag a boy in a
prison cage serving a sentence of five
years and mickey with a look in her
eyes hed never seen there before

  and now he heard pash speaking into
the telephone

  tell them to bring that girl in
then the big beak was pointed at jerry
its all pretty evident he said the
reason we couldnt find the ruby on you
was that youd planted it somewhere in
the store the girl went there to pick
it up and somehow malitoff had found
out what was going on he accused her
and she shot him

  the door opened and mickey came
in a policeman on each side of her at
sight of jerry a policeman at his elbow
she stopped startled then she laughed

  to think she said of seeing you
here

  jerry waved his hand

  from this distance how are you he
said

  im all right mickey told him but
these people are hard to convince they
insist on keeping right with me

  pash scowlingly regarded the girl

  has she been searched he asked

  the matron and a woman assistant
examined her said one of the police-
men

  what did they find

  nothing

  pash pointed a long finger at mickey

  what did you do with that revolver

  theyve all been asking me that
mickey told him mr engle asked me
about it a couple of times and he never
seemed satisfied when i told him i never
kept a watch out on such things once
he put his fist in my face i suppose
thinking that would make me remember
better

  jerry mooney shifted his look from
mickey to engle the man saw the threat
it held and he said to the girl

  youll tell before youre through
they usually do

  early this afternoon you went into
malitoffs place in the middle city tow-
er on a little matter of business said
pash to mickey your boy friend had
planted a valuable ruby somewhere
there aud you meant to pick it up
mr engle told you that captain
said mickey hes been telling it to
everyone hes even told it to me it
seems to be his favorite joke

  pash grinned at her wickedly

  when you went there he said you
thought you had the thing pretty well
sewed up but people like malitoff are
seldom dumb he was waiting for you
and when you found out he had you
shot him

  you go to too many movies captain
mickey suggested and theyre really
throwing you off balance

  that sounds a good bit like one of
mooneys clever sayings said pash but
were not handling that kind of stuff
just now he glowered at her what
kind of statement are you willing to
make about malitoffs death he asked

  i dont know anything about it
mickey said anyway no more than
the others who were in the place when
the shots were fired i was sitting in the
office next to mr malitoffs id been
shown there and was asked to wait
yes and then what

  i was waiting when i heard the
first shot i got up when i heard the
other i ran into the next office where
the sounds seemed to have come from
and i saw him lying on the floor

  pash wagged his head

  i dont think well have much trou-
ble breaking that down he said youre
in a jam young woman and youd do
yourself a good deal more good if you
told the truth

he put his elbows upon the desk and
began asking questions he could
be brutal and merciless also he could
keep up a constant fire of interrogations

  how often have you been in mali-
toffs he said

  never before said mickey

  i understand you went there to get
a setting replaced

  yes

  how come you picked out an expen-
sive place like that for a little job

  i was talking to mr mqoney this
morning just before he went out he
said if business didnt get better hed
have to go back to wrestling again or
something like that


mooneys in a jam

  whats that got to do with your go-
ing to malitoffs

  thats what im going to tell you
said mickey sweetly

  answer briefly and to the point
yes i know thats a good way to do
said mickey ive always believed in it
but as i was saying mr mooney was de-
pressed and he said he thought hed take
a few hours off and just stroll around
his idea was that hed look at jewelry
he likes jewelry he says it always does
him good to go into places where they
had rich settings and fine gems and just
sit and talk about them and look at
them

  yeah said pash and then what
after hed gone out said mickey
i thought of a clasp i have with a stone
missing mr mooneys talking about jew-
elry must have made me think about it
and it might be-smiling and nodding
at jerry-that his talking about high-
priced places made me think of mali-
toffs and how i ought to go there and
see if they had a setting like the one id
lost id tried all the low-priced places
and they didnt have it

  you left your work in your office to
do that

  malitoffs is not far from our place
and i went there during my lunch-
hour

  exasperated at the easy plausibility of
this pash began a barrage of questions
he was in the midst of it when there was
a knock and the door opened

  now wait said one of the police-
men you cant come in here

  brother said a young man in the
doorway dont be so sure he flour-
ished a paper how are you captain
he said cheerfully an order from judge
anderson

  but pash furiously gestured the docu-
ment aside

  how are police to run things if
someones always interfering with them
the young man with the paper
laughed and jerry said

  you see pash its only the police-
mans idea he should run things the
courts know he shouldnt

  i dont want any criticism from-you
said pash youre up to your neck in
trouble and youd better start thinking
about yourself

  believe me said jerry thats what
im doing-though at the same time my
trouble is mostly all in your imagination
in a half-hour ill be walking out of
here and telling you good-by

  if you walk out mooney said the
captain his eyes going to mickey youll
do it alone and in the end youll be
coming back youre in this thing and
well we know it youve outsmarted us
before but this time weve got you pretty
well tangled up

   ive often showed you how wrong you
were said jerry and i dont think
ill have to start making changes in the
act now before they turn the lights on
over the door tonight captain ill have
you chewing at your thumb and admit-
ting that sometimes as a cop youre
pretty cold

but when jerry talked with young
huntly downs of burgess  downs
a little later in a side room he wasnt
nearly so confident

   as far as  go he said everythings
all right but this thing about mickeys
got me down

  whos he asked downs

  what you mean is who is she said
jerry my secretary didnt you see
her out there

  oh yes said young downs aw-
fully nice-looking too but whats she
got to do with this diing

  you know this jewelry place i was
in said jerry i suppose curren told
you about that well it just happened
that mickey was there about an hour or
so after i was and while she was there
the proprietor was knocked off

   downs stared at him

  not murdered

  yes said jerry they say he was
cold when the people reached him shot
twice the thing that gives it a nasty
twist is that mickey was in the next of-
fice to malitoffs at the time she runs
in to him when she hears the shots and
when the others come piling in they find
her there and the police are all for
holding her for murder

   it looks ugly said downs but as
long as there was no reason for her do-
ing such a thing i suppose well be able
to straighten it out somehow

   now wait said jerry the police
havent got this-not yet anyway-but
its something youd better know this
malitoff has been in a lot of things that
the blue book magazine

havent looked so good mickeys broth-
er worked for him and in some kind of
a job he stole a car and malitoff afraid
the boyd squeal shifted some other stuff
on him and sent him to jail itd be just
like pash to dig that up and work it up
into a plausible reason for whats just
happened

  young downs expression was serious
ive seen less made to look pretty
bad

  what i want you to do right now
said jerry is to have the doors thrown
open so we can move out theres work
to be done on all this and we must have
a chance to do it

  but downs shook his head

  i can fix it for you but theyll hang
on to the girl-for a day or two anyway
but i want to have a talk with her may-
be therell be some angles thatll turn
the thing around in her favor there
was a pause and then the young attor-
ney said what started this going jer-
ry is it one of your romantic adven-
tures

  jerry grinned what do you think
he said

  what i think said downs is that
robin hood and brennan on the moor
lived a long time ago their kind of
stuffs not generally understood nowa-
days if you keep playing at it youll
get yourself in a jam some day that no
onell be able to get you out of

  o k said jerry but why cant
a guy have a little fun

in pashs office once more downs said
id like to speak to the girl now cap-
tain

  not with mooney standing by said
pash suspiciously

  hell not be said dovns id like
to have him taken into judge andersons
court right now and arraigned for a hear-
ing tomorrow

  and in the meantime to have him
running loose grumbled pash and
making more trouble

  jerry waved his hand to mickey

  sit tight he said mr downsll see
that youre treated right and ill be
back in a couple of hours if im not
ill call you up and report how things
are going

  after judge anderson had admitted
jerry to bail downs returned to head-
quarters for a talk with the girl mooney
called a cab and was hurried to his office
ates was there and as jerry came in he
got up and looked at him with wide eyes

jerry saw an early edition of an evening
paper lying on mickeys desk

  i see youve been reading the news
he said

   where isshe said ates his freckles
seemingjo dissolve and reappear again

  shes at headquarters said jerry
and he added bitterly hoping were
going to do something

  lets start doing it right away she
cant be in that place not in a cell
said ates theyve got rats in cells and
micks afraid of rats

   all right kid take it easy said
jerry shes not in a cell and shell
not be well have her out he lit a
cigarette anybody called

  yeah-mr chubby and mr gootch
and the newspapers i told them you
were out that friend of mickeys in the
dress shop called a couple of times she
was crying shed heard whats hap-
pened and she said she wants to lalk to
you about something important

  jerry hunted out the telephone num-
ber and in a moment or two had the
used-gown shop on the wire

  oh mr mooney said nora burns
i was just going to call again this ter-
rible thing about mickey what shall
we do how can we help her

  all we can do just now is try and
think said jerry ive found when i
do that i most always find something
i called because i have something to
tell you said nora its something
you ought to know

   ill be over there in a few minutes
said jerry and he called to ates

  hold on for a while im going out
if anybody comes in ask them to wait
if anybody telephones you dont know
anything

  im dumb said ates

   youre especially that way if any re-
porters come talking around you work
for me and get fifteen bucks a week
outside of that nothing has ever hap-
pened in the place

  in a little while he entered the hor-
tense shop and he found nora burns
her eyes red with weeping

  i think ill go simple she said to
him ive cried ever since i heard them
tell about the thing over the radio
well try to quit it said jerry
and tell me what youve got to say
she began to relate disjointedly what
the girl had said earlier that day

  now wait said jerry after a few
moments whats this about a promise
a promise to do what


mooneiys in a jam

  she promised me to never go near
malitoff i said to her that day-
what day interrupted jerry keep
the thing pinned together

it was the day poor tommy was sent
to prison explained nora sobbing i
thought shed die she looked so white
and sick and we were standing there-
standing where

  in the corridor at city hall we were
waiting for malitoff she wanted to see
him she said she wanted a close look
so shed remember him and when hed
passed us she took hold of my arm and
pointed after him she was shaking and
could hardly speak and she said she
was going to kill him

  now get your breath said jerry
disturbed and keep down the excite-
ment youre saying something serious
and i want to know how to value it
mickey said she mas going to kill mali-
toff she said it on the day her brother
was sent to prison on malitoffs evi-
dence

  yes and i begged her for gods
sake not to do it but she said she would
she told me said nora burns her
hands clasped together if she had any-
thing to do it with shed follow him
right then and fix him before he got out
of the building

  mickey said that jerry stared at
the woman

  mr mooney said nora im say-
ing this because i think you ought to
know it i wouldnt tell anyone else
yeah i know said jerry it dont
make me feel very good but just die
same telling it to me was the right thing
to do he lighted a cigarette what
else is there tell me more about this
promise

  i tried to make her promise never to
go near malitoff but she wouldnt do
it then i asked her to promise if she
ever did shed tell me before she went
she said shed do that and this morn-
ing when she came to look at the dresses
she told me where she was going

  she said she was going to his place
to shoot him

  she didnt say it no but she had
the same look in her face that i sav in it
that day after the trial

when jerry arrived at his office about
a quarter of an hour later it was
dark with cigarette- and pipe-smoke and
crowded with young men who sat upon
the chairs and desks and talked loudly
one of them armed with a camera which

had a flashlight attachment backed him
against the wall as soon as lie arrived

  get your pan all straightened out
jerry the young man advised because
this is going to be in die last edition
wheres the cane you had on when
you went into malitoffs asked another
of the young men weve heard you
got there looking like the grand duke of
some place get it out jerry and hook
it on your arm for a little class

  now listen said jerry im not
feeling any too good and id rather not
hear any remarks

  a young man with a pipe who sat
hugging his knees on top of a desk said
whats the idea of you feeling poor-
ly ive had inside instructions on die
value of that red ice twelve grand
nobody with that value on them could
feel anything but fine

  what drawer have you got it in
mooney said the youth with the cam-
era id like to take a slam at it they
could make the page up with the ruby
on one side and you on the other look-
ing at it across four columns of story
telling just how you pulled the job
jerry grinned hed given many a good
story to this crew and he knew they were
friendly but at the same time he knew
a news-hawk was completely a news-hawk

  what i was doing this morning he
informed them was amusing myself
fresh air and a stroll around town al-
so a drop-in here and there to refresh
the eyesight and put a new edge on the
appreciation for art objects just that
and i happened to stop at die wrong
place how could i tell ahead of time
that somebody had fixed up a little trick
on the worthy merchant and whats
a good bit more how could i know that
i was going to get an armful of publicity
by way of headquarters

  your story then said the thin-nosed
youth is that you were not tempted
the only thing i like to do about
rubies said jerry is look at them
slipping them into the side pocket is a
trick i leave for somebody else

  what about the girl asked another
reporter being held for sinking two
bullets into the malitoff system and put-
ting it permanently out of commission
that said jerry is something else
its been hinted that it isnt said the
reporter

  pash doesnt hint it said the young
man with the long chin he tosses it
right out where everyone can see and
hear it one job he says and it ought

the blue book magazine

to be one pinch he looks to have you in
the calabooza almost any minute

  pash has so many ideas that none of
them have a chance to operate said
jerry he sits on them the way an old
hen sits on a group of eggs hoping one
of themll hatch

  how long has this girl been in your
office said a youth with a soggy-look-
ing cigarette hanging from his mouth
a couple of years

  i hear said the youth shifting the
soggy cigarette skillfully she jumps out
with you now and then to a dance
not as often as id like said jerry
was it funny or wasnt it that she
happened in at malitoffs just a little
after engle picked you up

  things do happen said jerry and
that was one of them

 then you deny that the ruby had
anything to do with the two slugs said
the young man with the thin nose

  how could i deny it when i dont
know anything about it

  but you have heard about it havent
you

  i was listening while pash bounced
the idea up and down on his desk awhile
ago engle had handed it to him but
theyre both wrong more times than
theyre right

there was a fire of questions for the
best part of a half-hour jerry an-
swered good-humoredly and the group
gradually began to fade out the thin-
nosed young man with the long chin was
among the last and he said to jerry
from a news point of view youve
been highly unsatisfactory and i think
youd have done better if you loosened
up a trifle because the late editionsll
not look so good to you therell be a
pretty close-knit and abrupt little gang
of facts mooney went to malitoffs
looked at some high-priced gems one
valued at twelve thousand dollars is
missed mooney is arrested an hour
later his secretary who is remarkably
good-looking appears in the place mali-
toff is shot the girl is found beside
him protests she is innocent but is also
arrested mooney is released but its ex-
ected hell be taken into custody again
efore the days over the young man
pulled down his hat and settled himself
for departure how does that sound to
you

  its not too agreeable grinned jerry
but ive taken worse and come through
without springing a wheel

  after the office had been cleared of re-
orters jerry went into his own room
e put his feet upon the desk and began
to smoke and think what hed lately
learned was gnawing at his vitals that
mickey had actually shot malitoff that
shed waited coldly and patiently for an
opportunity and when that came shed
put two bullets in him was now hardly
to be denied shed put the pressure on
the night before to go into the case of
the mending-shop girl shed wanted
something done and shed seemed to
want to figure in it herself in the second
place there was this thing about her
saying shed shoot malitoff for loading
those five years on her brother in the
third place shed had a gun in her hand-
bag-jerry had seen it but when the po-
lice searched her after the shooting she
didnt have it

  there were windows in the office of
course if one of them had been open
she might have tossed the gun through
it but a weapon missing in a room al-
ways associated itself with an open win-
dow in the minds of the police

  jerry called to ates but there was no
reply he looked into the other office
the boy was curled up in his chair as
though asleep

  hey listen said jerry whats the
idea of sleeping in office hours

  excuse me said ates i wasnt
asleep i was thinking

  jerry grinned pretty deep he said
that much thinking ought to get you
something but before you go into it
again see if you can get gootch for me
after a few moments of telephoning
ates reported

  the last they heard of him was fifteen
minutes ago he told them he was on
his way here and to tell you so if you
called

  the boy stood in the doorway as if
reluctant to leave

  im thinking about mickey he said
i cant get her out of my mind

  me and you said jerry ive been
thinking so hard about her my brains
worn clean down to my eyebrows

  i hope said ates where she is
theyve got good lights and magazines to
read and things like that mick aint
the kind that cries about things but she
worries

  have you ever had any idea what its
about

  listen said ates but dont ever
tell her i said it she might get sore at
me i think shes got a tough brother
mooneys in a jam

do you know what i mean mr mooney
i aint sure if hes younger or older than
her but he must be kind of knotty and
shes thinking about him when she
worries

  what does she say

she dont say anything right out
rut the brother must be in some kind of
a jam somebodys riding him do you
know anything about that mr mooney
yeah a little

  would you know who that party is
  i couldnt be sure

  ates shifted his feet and looked down
at them then he said

  do you think it could have been this
malitoff

  what makes you think of him
mick was sore at somebody she went
around to malitoffs and he was shot
yeah-and what next

  ates was white he put his hand on
jerrys arm and lowered his voice
this morning here in the office she
had a gun

  mickey had

  i saw her take it out of her hand-
bag she put it in the drawer in her
desk

  well said jerry

  after i read in the paper what had
happened i got scared i looked in the
drawer and the gun wasnt there
when she went out she must have taken
it with her

  jerry looked at him

  you like mickey dont you ates
shes always been swell with me i
was a mutt when i first came here and
she helped me

  that being so said jerry youre
keeping everything youve seen or heard
to yourself youre telling no one

  im not said ates nobodyll find
out anything from me

a short time later gootch appeared
in jerrys office he sat by the desk
and smoked a high-smelling cigarette

  after i read the news of these things
that have happened i did not wait to
speak to you and i was not sure if
that was possible because of the police
he told jerry

  they had me for a while said jerry

  so right away i went out again to
these middle city tower and began to
ask questions very careful you under-
stand i did not want to make suspicion
there were things i knew youd like to
hear what had happened in malitoffs
place before the shots were fired also
what happened afterward

  very important things said jerry
also said gootch there was some-
thing else i wanted to know who were
there-what people were present in the
showroom and in the offices when the
shooting was done

  how did you make out

  i have questioned and i have ana-
lyzed said gootch i found the girl
entered the office at fifteen minutes of
one oclock that is also the time the
police have for it it is a slack period
most people shopping have stopped to
take lunch also some of malitoffs em-
ployees have gone out for theirs gootch
took some slips of paper from his pocket
at  a man and his wife came in
they left at  a girl came in at
-a stranger she had a small dog
she left at  a messenger-boy de-
livered a telegram at  and left at
once at  a young man came in to
price an engagement ring two old la-
dies stopped in to see a diamond brooch
which one of them had looked at the
day before they came in at 
these two old ladies the young man
who was pricing rings and the girl from
your office were the only patrons in the
place when the shots were fired that
killed malitoff

  you are sure of that said jerry

  i am positive said gootch also
i know that the police after checking
up have said the same thing

  nice close work said jerry

  the doorman said gootch threw
the lock on at exactly  i read it on
the automatic device on the door
howd you manage to get in

  i said i was a friend of malitoffs
said gootch i had been there earlier in
the day these people of the store had
seen me engle questioned me it was
while he was doing this that i learned
most of the things i have written down
jerry grinned

  engles not a bad cop he said but
he does talk too much he looked at
gootch for a moment how many of
the stores people were there at 
and who were they

  the doorman was there said
gootch mr prawn the head sales-
the blue book magazine

man plutstine the diamond setter and
a porter four in all

  and it wasnt possible for anyone to
get out before the lock was taken off the
door

  no

  when was it taken off

  when the police arrived at 
said gootch

  take them all together-customers
employees police who do they think
did it

the girl the idea is no one else
could have done it engle was very
sure he threatened he shook his fist
jerry pulled down one comer of his
mouth in scorn

  he thinks that gets him something
also said gootch i found that
malitoff had enemies

  who asked jerry

  it was not said maybe they did not
know

  people like malitoff always have a
lot of ex-friends said jerry and often
they are enterprising people a bullet or
two dont mean much to them

  when gootch had finished and gone
jerry had ates get him a number on the
telephone

  hello sid said jerry when a voice
spoke in his ear this is mooney
are you still at city hall jerry
no i stepped out of there

  i was laying money you would right
away when i heard about it i said
they aint got no rummy in mooney
hell be out before they can turn
around 

  i wonder if you can get hold of
chubby for me

  sure

  all right tell him ill be at your
place in fifteen minutes

  right away

chubby was sitting at a comer ta-
ble when jerry entered sids restau-
rant jerry sat down opposite him put
some cigarettes on the table and ordered
red wine

  have you seen cora

  yes and everythings all right from
her end its good you had her planted
there to take the stone when the other
girl made the pass thatdve been a
hard spot for anybody to talk themselves
out of

  there are some others just as hard
said jerry this killings got an ugly
angle for the last hour ive been trying
to think how i might get working on it

but nothing seems any good he sipped
at his drink and then put down the glass
what word have you had from doxey
i saw her an hour ago when i told
her about the ruby her eyes just laid out
on hercheeks but she asked me where
it came from and when i told her right
away she started to get nervous-i guess
about malitoff being knocked off

  did she make an offer

  yes she thought about eight grand
  take it and get cash

  o k said chubby but some-
body else might offer more

  the people who are to get this money
cant wait

  ill get it said chubby inside an
hour

  jerry sipped at his drink once more
when  saw you this morning you
said there was a party at malitoffs you
were going to ask about

  that was the doofman yeah i
found out about him his names sud-
ler was one time a boxer not much
good i hear he got the thick ears most-
ly working as a sparring partner 
anything else

  no but if you want more ill go a
little further

  jerry got up and went to a telephone-
booth at the back of the room he dialed
a number and when the reply came he
said

  georgie

 yeah that you mooney the
voice was full of excitement where are
ou-down at the d as work on him
ig boy dont let him get set

  i was wondering if youd heard whats
happened

   got it about an hour ago said the
voice and i left a guy on the rubbing-
table with him still sweating and took
a cab for city hall to tell them what i
thought a girl like mickey in the can
for knocking somebody off aint they
got no sense does a person have to be
that dumb to be a cop

  sometimes said jerry they get ex-
cited

  they were that way with me said
georgie and were for throwing me
out

  did they

  well they did get me out with about
six of them pulling on the oars but i
wouldnt call that throwing and now
listen said the voice what are you do-
ing about this thing

  im on that right now i called to
ask if you know a party named sudler

mooneys in a jam

  sudler georgie considered seems
to me i do whats he like

  he used to be a fourth-rate pug hes
got the ears and the scars but never had
much else

  sudler said georgie still thinking
yeah i know him but i dont know
where from and listen the only thing
im sure of is that hes some kind of a
heel just hold on a while and let me
turn him over ill get him nice and
bright for you

ill be running around to your place
in another ten minutes said jerry
keep after him between now and then
he hung up the receiver and returned
to chubby

  i may get something about sudler
myself he said but id like you to
keep him in mind also see what you
can do with the other employees at mal-
itolls there may be something useful
he talked awhile with chubby then
he left the restaurant and after turning
a few corners entered a building on arch
street in a huge room fitted as a gym-
nasium he found georgie lotts big
blond and with a shock of hair hanging
over one eye superintending the efforts
of a half dozen stout men past middle
age who lay in a row upon a wrestling
mat lifting and lowering their legs in
unison

  hey listen said georgie im all
up in the air these parties must all be
crazy if i ever get a chance at that
pretzel they call engle im going to tie
his ears under his chin

  take it easy advised jerry dont
do anything thatll make her more trou-
ble than shes got already

  georgie had forgotten the row of stout
performers upon the mat

  that sudler you phoned about ive
got him pegged i used to see him at
rudy salvos place i thought he worked
there and one time i asked rudy what
he had a guy like that on the pay-roll
for and rudy told me he wasnt he
said klem paid him

  what klem asked jerry

  that klem that has an office in the
w m z building-you know he buys
pieces of things of horses of bets of
fighters of outdoor shows

  yeah said jerry eddie klem
what was sudlers job with him

  i dont know said georgie but
klems smart hes got little turns the
other fellow dont think of and may-
be he finds a dumb-bell like that comes
in handy once in a while

  maybe youre right said jerry
though i dont think you could get me
to follow you more than halfway on it
sudler worked on the road with some
of klems fighters said georgie may-
be he even boxed with some of them
or he might have been a kind of a front
in some of klems shows where the cus-
tomers were rough

  jerry looked at his watch

  i think ill slip around and have a
talk with eddie he said

jerry mooney dropped in at a corner
drug-store not far from georgies
place hunted out a number in a small
book and dialed it there was a mur-
muring voice a womans voice

  mrs doxey jerry asked

  whos calling

  mooney

  oh yes mr mooney but you know
i never talk business over the telephone
im asking a question said jerry
youve been in the jewelry trade for
some time and i thought you might be
able to tell me do you know eddje
klem

  ive done business with him

  was he interested financially or any
other way in mali toffs business

  there was a pause then the voice
said

  ive heard-though i dont know-
that he was a partner

  o k said jerry thats all and
many thanks

  he hung up and left the place mak-
ing his way north on broad street he
turned east a few blocks below and in at
the entrance to a huge office building
jerry looked at the long display of names
in white letters upon the gleaming black
wall and located the office of e b klem
arriving at the floor indicated jerry went
in at a door which carried a number only
a wide-headed man with a bulging stom-
ach sat reading a newspaper at a desk
he looked at jerry

  whats wanted he said

  klem said jerry where is he
the man did not seem pleased at the
abruptness of this he put down the
newspaper

  whats your business


the blue book magazine

  i forget said jerry but hurry in
and tell him mooneys here maybe hell
get talking with me anyhow

  hes not in said the man

  you wouldnt go out of your way to
kid me would you said jerry

  the man got up

  suppose he said you step outside
listen said jerry his voice lifted
its sudden volume filling the room tell
klem that mooneys here and wants to
see him and put away that sour look
its not getting you anything so why
waste it

  there was the sound of a chair being
pulled back and - then the door of an
inner office opened and a man appeared
hello eddie said jerry i havent
seen you for some time how are they
treating you

  the man was thin-faced he had black
dull-looking hair and smooth white skin
there was what might be called a ha-
bitual smile about his mouth and his
eyes were bright with a fixed derision

  this is a surprise he said i
thought they had you in the can

  all a mistake said jerry the
boys were a little hasty

  what about the glamorous office-as-
sistant said klem lounging in the door-
way did they change their minds
about her too

  not yet said jerry you see the
way these parties are put together they
can only think of one thing at a time
but theyll get around to the other idea
in a little while

  the derision in klems eyes was more
marked than ever

  do you want to see me he asked
well to tell you the truth said
jerry i did have that in mind when i
headed in here

he followed klem into the other of-
fice the man didnt ask him to sit
down but closed the door and stood
staring at him

  whats it about he said

  i thought it might be pleasant if you
and me had a few words about malitoff
said jerry

  what would that be for

  it was just a notion of mine jerry
said seeing you were in the business
with him i thought maybe a little con-
versation might work you up out of your
depression you know what i mean
when a guy youre pretty close to is sud-
denly sunk right in the shop you just
naturally feel down about it

  klems eyes were half-closed now and
the smile about his mouth was ugly

  i always pick the people  want to
talk to about private matters he said
so if thats all you want what say if
you move on out

  whats the hurry said jerry cheer-
fully weve got all the rest of the
afternoon ahead of us he took out a
cigarette and tapped it on the back of his
hand you and malitoff have been in
quite a few things together i hear
ive been in things with a lot of peo-
ple said klem

  yeah but none of the others have got
two btdlets in them thats what makes
malitoff interesting just now the po-
lice are busy turning things over of
course i know just as well as you that
their works faulty but if you give them
time they always dig up a little some-
thing and the federal copsll be in on
this case too theyll be looking into the
times malitoff imporied the ice and for-
got to mention it to the customs people
youll figure in that you see and the
talk might begin to go around which
wont be so nice

  well when i begin to find myself in
anything i dont care for said klem
ill make my own arrangements ill
not go to you looking for help

  that said jerry is whats called
prejudice i know ive loaded you into
a police car a few times when i was a
regular cop but things like that are of
the past i hurry around here this after-
noon to split up some talk with you on
important current matters and right
away you begin reaching back into the
year before last to get hold of something
that oughtnt to bother you at all
alonzo called klem to the man in
the outer office

  the man appeared in the doorway
mr mooneys going out said klem
this way said alonzo to jerry with
an air of satisfaction

  the bums rush grinned jerry he
lighted the cigarette i know just how
its started manys the time ive been
slammed through a door and up against
an opposite wall he blew out a rift
of smoke and looked at klem genially
but youre making a mistake here
alonzo sags too much in the middle to
do the job alone why dont you hop
to the phone for a minute and get that
number at middle city tower maybe
sudlerd run over and lend a hand
klem looked at jerry for a moment in
silence then he motioned to alonzo


mooneys in a jam

  thatll be all he said when the
man had left the office klem smiled
you move around dont you he said

  with me everythings a proceeding
jerry answered yon were next in this
one and thats why im here

  yeah said klem i see that but
whats behind it

  as i go from one thing to another
said jerry i come across items that i
think ought to be looked into that you
were hooked up with malitoff was one of
those that your bouncer sudler is
doorman in the malitoff place was an-
other the secret in getting along as a
private cop said jerry is to give every-
thing a good looking-up

  was that why you went to malitoffs
place today asked klem and is that
why the girl followed in after you some-
time later

  things break badly sometimes said
jerry this wasnt our lucky day

  a twelve-grand stone disappears while
youre looking at it a mans shot while
the girls in the next room-a room with
an open communicating door klems
eyes gleamed with derision if i was in
the cops he said id take a good bit
of interest in those two things as a pair

  dont worry said jerry head-
quarters is bearing down from all angles
thats the one thing they always do and
knowing that is what made me get
thinking about you of course you be-
ing in the business with malitoff and
your ex-bodyguard sudler now working
there might not mean anything at all
what i mean is nothing interesting but
you never can tell how a fellah like
pashll see a thing

  if the police get looking at me about
the matter said klem all ill do is
have a big laugh but he was not
laughing at the moment there was a
scowling threat in his thin face as he
looked at jerry i dont like what
youre saying mooney or the way youre
saying it and im telling you to keep
at a distance in my affairs

  jerry grinned cheerfully

  you wouldnt believe how far away i
can met said jerry because mixing in
other peoples business is something i
never do but then sometimes i have
affairs of my own and when im working
with them i got to get in pretty close
klem said nothing for a space and
when he spoke again his voice was cold

  i understand he said youve been
running around a good bit lately with
this girl that works for you

  with the unhurried motion of a big
cat jerry moved toward the man and
he said

   in a little while shes going to stand
up with me and take on the job of being
mrs mooney aint that all right
with me it is said klem but
what im working up to is this seeing
shes in trouble you ought to be careful
keep your ideas to yourself dont go
drifting around talking a good bit
could happen to anyone in a spot like
shes in you know

  yeah i know said jerry its a
thing ive been having in my mind all
afternoon but he said while youre
thinking that way eddie dont forget
the things that could happen to any

earties that tried to sew her up theyd
e plenty and they wouldnt be easy to
get away from

  i see what you mean klem said
and im glad you came in and passed
the time of day nothings really been
done but-and his eyes shone with de-
rision-we understand each other and
thats something

jerry on his way out paused long
enough in the lower corridor of the
w m z building to call steve cur-
ren at the district attorneys office
whats new he asked

   were moving said steve slowly
though the police are still yapping
we have to get most of that out of our
ears before we can really get down to
business

   did you look after mickey as i asked
you

  right away i went into pashs of-
fice raised some hell and took her away
from them shes now in a room in the
sheriffs department with one of our
men at the door to see that shes not dis-
turbed too much

   good boy steve said jerry ill
not forget this

   pashs people have been looking for
the gun said curren but as far as
i know theyve had no success

   are they still at malitoffs

   pash is there himself just now with
a couple of his best workmen

  whenll your people move in


the blue book magazine

  ill be down there myself in the next
half-hour

  thatll be fine said jerry be-
cause ill be wandering along that way
and i dont know but what ill be trying
to squeeze in also you being therell
save me an argument

  o k said the assistant district at-
torney come right along but dont
forget jerry in this office we deal in
law and law only all comers friends
or enemies are treated alike

  jerry grinned at this but he said

  i get what you mean and many
thanks steve so long

when jerry reached his office ates
haley met him at the door

  youve got a caller hes inside

  it was chubby and when he saw jerry
he got up out of his chair in swift ex-
citement

  listen he said coras in the hos-
pital

  whats happened asked jerry

  i called her place a while ago to tell
her i was coming in to pick up the ice
and then i hear it from the landlady
she said shed knocked on coras door
and shed got no answer also the dog
didnt bark which was something it sel-
dom didnt do and then she went in
cora was on the floor-completely out
somebody had hit her on the head and
the whole place was torn up as if some-
body had been looking for something
also said chubby the pooch was
dead

  looks like the rubys gone said
jerry quietly but his brows knitted

  thats the first thing came into my
mind said chubby i called up the
hospital but they wouldnt let me talk
to her

  where is she asked jerry

  chubby named the hospital

  ill run down there said jerry
hold on here until you hear from me
he got a cab in a few minutes and
in a few more he was at the hospital and
was shown to the girls room cora had
a bandage about her head and her face
was pale blit she greeted him eagerly
and when the nurse had left the room
she said

  i guess the whole jobs messed up
jerry but i did my best i never thought
of a thing like this

  what do they say about you said
jerry i mean the doctors

  its just a bump said cora ill
be out in a couple of days

  i dont feel too good about it said
jerry here i frame this thing think-
ing im clever and now look mickeys
being held while the police look into a
murder and here this things happened
to you

  you dont mention the ruby said
the girl

  i suppose its gone said he

  it is i had it hidden waiting for
chubby but they found it

  do you feel you could tell me a little
about what happened

  my apartment bell rang and a
womans voice spoke to me on the door
telephone she said shed like to see me
on some business and could i give her
a few moments so i clicked the street
door for her and she came up i had
never seen her before she w-as tall an
artificial blonde and very well dressed
she spoke in a low voice and smiled and
was very well mannered she wanted to
know about her sister who she said
once lived in the house she was agitated

i thought she wras going to faint and i
went into the kitchen to get her a glass of
water while i was there i heard a sud-
den and peculiar sound from my little
dog toto when i came back into the
room toto was stretched out on the
floor and the woman was standing look-
ing down at him

  she said she thought he had a fit i
bent over him and then she hit me with
something when i came to the police
were there and the people with the am-
bulance

  shed cleaned up on the dog first to
make sure thered be no noise said
jerry

  yes said cora i think that was
the idea and when i saw how the place
had been ransacked i thought of the
ruby and before id let them take me
away i looked to see if it was where id
put it but it wasnt the woman had
found it and taken it with her

  jerry talked with the girl awhile and
then after hed seen the people in the
hospital business office and made all ar-
rangements for care and medical atten-
tion he left the building at the first
public telephone he called his office

  mooney proceedings came the boy-
ish voice of ates haley

  this is mooney jerry said is
chubby still there

  yessir waiting for you

  in another moment chubbys voice
sounded

  hiyah been expecting you


mooneys in a jam

  ive just had a little talk with cora
jerry said she told me how she came
to get slammed that way it was a
woman

  nol said chubby listen fellah
theyre getting into everything aint
they

  you know some of eddie klems peo-
ple dont you

  not many and them not much

  what about a woman tall a made
blonde very ladylike when she wants
to be

  that might be sonya said chubby
but look dont tell me shes the party
that leaned her weight on cora

  that tvas the description i want
you to get busy if you can find out if
klems had her on any kindsof a job
call up my place every now and then and
report and let me know where i can
get you

  right said chubby youll be
hearing

  once more in the street jerry headed
for the middle city tower deep in
thought when hed heard the story of
nora burns and listened to what ates
haley had said about the gun hed be-
come convinced that mickey because of
the wrong done her brother had shot
malitoff

  but now things were changing there
were other threads in the fabric he was
handling surprising and exciting threads

  somethings been going on inside
he told himself maybe im getting too
sunshiny but it looks as if i could show
mick out in the clear after all

there was a policeman standing at
each side of the door at malitoffs
when jerry readied there

  no visitors brother said one of
them

  jerry grinned amiably im wanting
a few words with mr curren of the dis-
trict attorneys office he said

  theres no one from the district at-
torneys office here said the man

  jerrys grin broadened captain
pash is here he said id like to speak
to him the name is mooney

  the policeman opened the door a
trifle and spoke to someone inside and
in a few moments pash appeared

  what you want he asked

  it came into my mind awhile ago
that if i came down here i might be able
to turn up a few things jerry said
agreeably so i thought id have a few
words with you

  listen said pash his nutcracker face
screwed up tightly the only words i
want from you will be when i tell you
what cell youre going to be put in this
is one time mooney that ive got the
knuckles in your neck and im going to
make you say uncle before im through
the real fault ive got to find with
you said jerry is that you take every-
thing too much to heart you believe
too much a man thats been around as
much as you ought to take a little time
and sort things out

  keep him away from the door said
pash to the policeman if he insists 
hanging around treat him rough

  he was about to close the door when
jerry said

  just a moment heres a mutual
friend -how are you steve-to the
young assistant district attorney who had
just stepped out of the elevator

  sorry if ive kept you waiting said
curren as he shook jerry by the hand

  not too much said jerry just
long enough for me to have a pleasant
little chat with captain pash

  now look here curren said pash
glowering i dont want this man inter-
fering in my business i dont want him
here at all

  well thats too bad said curren
who evidently was a young man whod
not stand glowering but i think xve
want him captain on our business i
hope it doesnt annoy you too much
jerry followed curren into the big
showroom there were a number of
people from headquarters present some
of whom knew jerry and nodded to him
pash who had been talking to the sales-
man prawn when jerrys arrival inter-
rupted him resumed his questioning
where hed left off

  im to understand then he said
you never saw this girl before she came
here today	

  to the best of my knowledge i never
did said prawn

  did she show any excitement while
she talked with you

  no sir

  nothing that would indicate that she
was thinking of shooting a man

  not anything

  what were your impressions of her
what thoughts were in your mind while
you talked with her

  i dont recall any marked impres-
sions she was a beautiful girl hand-
somely dressed and with nice manners
did she ask to see malitoff
the blue book magazine

  not at once she had some work-
remounting and replacement we talked
about that for a while said prawn anx-
iously but it was a piece of work that
would be difficult to carry out it was
when wed reached that place in the mat-
ter that she asked to see mr malitoff
what did you do then

  i went into his office to ask him if
hed speak with her he said he would
so i took her into one of the rooms that
you see there and told her mr malitoff
would see her in a few minutes

  and then

  she sat down in a chair at the desk
and i went out of the room

  did you close the door after you
  yes sir i did

  all right said pash thatll be
enough for now maybe ill listen to
you again after a while

  if you dont mind said jerry to
pash id like to have a few words with
him and before pash could speak he
went on to prawn how long have you
worked for malitoff

  im not sure said the man but
id say a dozen years

  while youve been here has he ever
been in any other line of business
well yes said prawn after a mo-
ments hesitation

  do you remember his being in trou-
ble at any time again the man hesi-
tated think hard trouble with the
government smuggling

  yes said prawn i believe there was
something of that kind

  have you known any of the people
who were in that line with him

  no i have not

  but here pash interrupted what i
want to know he said to jerry is what
this has to do with your secretary

  it has nothing to do with her said
jerry and thats the idea im try-
ing to get a few facts together somehow
thatll show she had nothing to do with
this thing youre holding her for

  the trouble mr malitoff had with
the government said prawn hap-
pened some years ago mr malitoft has
done no importing since then his time
has been given to this place and to the
buying and selling and renting of real
property

  has he another office for that part of
his business asked curren

  no sir all mr malitoffs affairs were
carried on here i had the management
of his real-estate accounts and i collect-
ed the rents

  jerry was about to resume his ques-
tioning but pash gestured him aside

  now wait a minute he said as i
see it this is only a waste of time to
curren i cant allow this man to in-
terfere in my case because hes prac-
tically -fn custody himself on a charge
that we feel pretty sure will hook him up
with the killing

  jerry beamed genially at the captain
no interference meant captain he
said the police may go on just as
though i wasnt here

  oh we may may we said pash
well thats pretty nice of you aint it
what i thought was you were going to
squeeze us out into the corridor

  no said jerry  wouldnt ever
think of a thing like that the police
are often useful im always for letting
them stay just to see what theyll do

however as pashs questioning of
the other employees proceeded jer-
ry seemed to lose interest he spoke to a
clerk who was standing at one side
where did the shooting take place
there said the man pointing you
see those offices there are three of
them mr malitoffs was the one in the
center the girl was shown into the
one to the right of that

  and the other one asked jerry
thats used by plutstine said the
man for repair work and such

  jerry went into the room where
mickey had been shown by prawn his
eyes went about carefully point after
point there was the desk where she
must have sat when prawn closed the
door there was the doorway leading
into malitoffs office he noted the two
windows these seemed to attract him
he lifted one of them and looked out
there were no fire-escapes or projections
by way of which any one could pass from
one suite of offices to another

  there was a narrow traffic way below
and opposite was a low-built shabby-
looking building with a broad and much
cluttered roof he closed the window
and went into malitoffs office

  hello nugent he said to the po-
liceman stationed there

  how are you jerry replied the po-
liceman

  everything going right

  except that the old man aint making
much headway said nugent

  he never does jerry said that old
buzzard would rather use his needle any
time than act like an intelligent cop
mooneys in a jam

  he looked around the room there
was a spot of blood showing where mali-
toff had fallen the stain was dark and
ugly-looking he threw up one of the
windows and looked out

  a long- drop he said

  no chance there said the police-
man weve been all over that

  whats been done about the gun
asked jerry

  theyre working on it but no dice
so far two men have combed every-
thing and theyre going over it again
one of them was up here awhile ago for
further orders and he told me from the
way people talk and act down there they
not only didnt see that gun but they
never saw any gun

  what building is that asked jerry
pointing to the structure opposite

  thats the elysium theater the
side of it the front is around the cor-
ner on the next street

  jerry went back to the room where the
assistant district attorney was now work-
ing over the employees he shook hands
with curren who said in surprise

  what going so soon i thought
youd be snooping around here for the
next hour or two

  i may be back before the days over
said jerry but im thinking of some out-
side things just now and unless im mis-
taken theres light beginning to show
im glad you think so said curren
things dont look so promising here
i didnt expect anything new when i
came here said pash we had a case
already what it needs is putting to-
gether the party that knocked off
malitoff is at headquarters

  the party will be at headquarters
said jerry sometime in the next few
hours he smiled at pash be ex-
pecting a call from me because im go-
ing to let you make the arrest

  youll always be a smart guy sneered
pash but listen to this i am going to
make an arrest today and the party i
put my hand on will be you

jerry mooney called sids eating-place
  from a public telephone

  whats the word on chubby he
asked



  he called awhile ago and said if you
phoned in to say he was just finishing
up and hed see you at your place in
maybe a half-hour

  o k sid jerry answered many
thanks

  he reached his office in ten minutes
time

  chubby called ates told him he
said he was on his way in

  jerry lighted a cigarette and put his
feet on his desk the thing was open-
ing up the minute chubby had men-
tioned klems name things had started

  there had to be a party like klem in
it jerry said to himself also there
had to be a blonde in it just to keep the
books straight

the burma ruby that was the thing
to start from when hed walked into
malitoffs that morning all fixed to take
the gem from the diamond merchant it
had never entered his head that there
might be some one else thinking the
same thing

  of course he admitted if id really
got my mind operating id have known
there must be because when a thing
like that is known to be locked up in a
safe somewhere the whole intelligentsia
begins to buzz dozens of smart boys be-
gin to edge into the section there was
some one he mused all fixed ready
to pull their little trick and me like a
big stiff had to have mickey walk in and
take the shock

  there was one thing he agreed with
pash upon the ruby and the murder
were hooked together he was still turn-
ing this over when ates came in from
the outer office

  ive been reading a two-star said
ates and it tells how the gun aint
been found yet it wasnt any place
around the offices or in anybodys pock-
et not in mickeys or any of the peo-
ples that worked in the place and none
of the customers had it so the paper
prints it must have been thrown out of
the window

  yeah said jerry theyre working
on that

  that little place down behind middle
city tower is mccaldrum street said
ates if anything like a pistol was
chucked out of a window and fell into
mccaldrum street somebodyd see it
and they wouldnt keep it for theyd
hear about the murder itcl be a hot
gun and might get them into trouble
right said jerry
the blue book magazine

  so said ates seeing nobody aint
turned it in i think it didnt fall into
the street whoever heaved it out of the
window if anybody did maybe gave it
plenty of power and maybe it fell on the
roof of the theater across the street

  it might be so said jerry but the
police have thought of that too and
theyve covered it just as they have every-
thing else

  did you look down on that roof
ates asked its got all kinds of stuff
on it-junk that once was things they
used in plays if anything was thrown
there it might slip under something
else if youll let me off for a half-hour
id like to go down there and hunt on
that roof

  youd not be allowed up there said

  yes i would said ates i know i
would and thats what made me think
of it tony cenzis the watchman there
he lives in our street and i know him
ive been up there with him a couple of
times

  ates was smart and the office knew it
jerry looked at him and while the thing
was still turning in his mind the outer
door opened and chubby came in

  all right said jerry to the boy
give it a try but remember no talk
not to anybody or about anything
chubby seated himself beside jerrys
desk

  i think ive got a little something
he said

  lets have it said jerry and i
hope its good

  if you remember as soon as you men-
tioned what this dame looked like-the
one who socked cora-i thought of son-
ya chubby said tall plenty of shape
a made blonde and with a lot of nerve
the first time i saw her she was doing
the hostess thing in a night-club that
klem had money in then i saw her
running a swell place for him in miami
one time when sime and me were down
looking over a prospect shes been
stringing along with klem ever since
has she ever been in anything the
police had hold of asked jerry

  shes been on the edge a couple of
times only lately the wranglers-a
cozy kind of clip-joint she managed-
was pulled but she battled her way out
of court with klems help as she al-
ways does she lives at the etruria an
old pal of mine tweedy-i think you
know him-is a kind of a house cop there
and i went around and talked to him

he told me sonyas been jittery ever since
the wranglers sunk moneys short with
her some days she keeps the telephone
hot for a half-hour at a time trying to
stick the label on somebody but it
never seems to work but today she got
a call that must have had stuff in it
for she phoned for a cab and tore out
of the place in a terrible hurry and in
about an hour she came back as fast as
shed gone and as excited as hell
what time was that asked jerry
the nearest tweedy could put it was
early this afternoon

  i think said jerry ill step around
to the etruria and try and get up a con-
versation maybe itll not turn out to
be what i think but sonyas leading
somewhere and ive got a lot of interest
in her put the lock on the door as you
go out he said his hand on the knob
the kid maybell not be back for a
while

  but before he could open the door the
telephone rang he went to it

  hello he said

  this is steve curren

  hello steve whats going on
youre going to be picked up pash
has already sent engle and another man
out after you

  cant you talk him out of it you
know ive got a lot of going-around to
do said jerry ive got to put enough
stuff together in the next couple of hours
to get the girl out of the can

  id like to oblige you said curren
but something happened since  saw
you last the police have dug up in-
formation that puts a kind of a new face
on this whole thing it seems the girl
has a brother who got in trouble some-
time ago and this fellow malitoff testi-
fied against him and sent him up for a
stretch the boy said the charges were
false and the girl threatened to kill
malitoff also its known that just a
few days after shed made this threat she
got a gun some one in the apartment
she lives in has seen it and reported it

mccaidrttm street directly behind
middle city tower was quite nar-
row the huge office-building overhung it
gloomily the side wall of the theater
was dingy-looking at some long-past
time it had been painted but the paint
had now peeled off in uncouth patches
the windows were high and dusty the
doorways battered

  ates haley appeared in the street
about a quarter of an hour after hed

mooneys in a jam

left the mooney office with his hands in
his trousers pockets and chewing gum he
moved along with a careless air

  its best not to look too smart he
told himself thats the way you get
people to taking notice and i dont
want to do that

  mccaldrum was a squeezed-up little
street most times when you went along
it there were broken packing-boxes car-
tons discarded excelsior and a lot of oth-
er junk at back doors availing to be swept
up and carted away but this day the
guys must have been in there early for
the whole street was looking tidy

  ates moved on until he reached the
rear of middle city tower the ninth
floor was a terrible way up if anybody
had heaved a gun out of a window up
there and it hit the stones it wouldve
broken apart it couldnt help it

  but ates didnt chink any of this had
happened his idea was when anybody
shot anybody else especially in a place
where there were a lot of other people
they were excitcd theyd want to get
the gun away as soon as they could be-
ing excitcd theyd throw it hard and
if the gun that did this shooting was
thrown hard out of a ninth-floor window
of the tower itd sail right across onto
the roof of the theater

  so the boy opened the stage door anti
went in it was gloomy and depressing
inside he knew where the light-switch
was and turned it on and instantly a
voice came from the interior

  hey whos that

  hello tony said ates where arc
you

  there was a halting step and a small
distorted shape appeared

  howre you benny said ates i
thought it was tony

  no it was me said the twisted man
he leaned against the wall to take his 
weight off a crippled leg but i made
believe it was tony i got so now i can
talk just like him

  ates grinned

  you certny had me fooled ben he
said i was sure it was tony

  im getting better all the time said
the crooked man much gratified ive
been practicing an imitation of a stage
carpenter sawing through a plank and
you ought to hear my finish for that-
where the sawed-off piece falls on the
floor

  boy said ates ill bet thats a
nice one you get a lot of stuff like that
together and youll have something

  you better believe i am said the
crooked little man and im practicing
on the pigeons you know how they go
when a lot of them get together

  that ought to be easy for you said
ates theres such a lot of pigeons
around these buildings he looked at
benny his fate blank of ulterior mean-
ing you ought to get up on the roof
sometime sos you can hear them bet-
ter there must be some of them have
their nests there

   i gel up there every time i can said
benny id be up there this afternoon
if it wasnt for ihe police

  what police

aint you heard whats happened
said benny somebodys been shot
across the street and the police think
the gun was thrown out of a window on-
to our roof theyre up there now
hunting for it its the second time
theyve been here

    wonder if i could go up said ates
nobodys allowed to said benny
nobody but the cops thats what im
doing here at the back door tony told
me to stay here but just when you
turned the light on i was going outside
to take a smoke the fire-insurance peo-
ple dont let us smoke inside here-and
when ive got a cigar i like to sit out-
side with it i always enjoy it that way
ill be waiting till tony comes down
said ates so ill sit with you

  they went outdoors and benny coiled
his crooked body and leg in a fearsome
knot on the wooden steps he took out
a long pale-looking cigar and lighted it

  this is the last one he told ates
 had three of them but i smoked the
others

  you must be in the chips said ates
buying cigars three at a time

  i didnt buy them said benny
thats the best part of it  got them
for nothing gravy the dishwasher
down here at the short order cafe gave
em to me    he didnt know i was
here said benny chuckling i had the
door open just a little way looking to
see if tony was coming he was out for
a minute-i think down at the corner
and the street-cleaners were here and
just as i looked i saw gravy come up
out of the basement at the short order
cafe then he climbed up on the guard
of the back wheel of the truck and got
something out of it he put it in his
apron pocket said benny now laugh-
ing and he looked around to see if
the blue book magazine

anybody noticed him then he saw
me

  whatd he do then said ates try-
ing to keep eagerness out of his voice

  he went into their place with a car-
ton of something hed brought up out of
the basement but he came out again
right away and walked down here and
he said to me it wasnt much hed got
it was just something in the junk he
thought maybe he could use so he gave
me the three cigars and said not to men-
tion it to the street-cleaners they were
always tough with him he said and he
didnt want no trouble

  maybe he was right ates said
gravy aint so strong you know

  ates talked with the crippled man a
little longer and then moved on down
the street he paused before the short
order cafe then went inside seated him-
self at the far end of the bar and ordered
a glass of milk and a cut of lemon pie
from where he sat he could see a por-
tion of the kitchen especially he could
see that portion in which gravy ap-
peared every now and then to pick up
the soiled plates and cups and cutlery
finally he caught his eye and beckoned
and gravy came out into the bar

  hello kid said gravy he was very
tall and very thin he had a slack jaw
and there was in his bearing something
furtive and mouselike

  howre you getting on asked ates
gravy looketl toward the barman and
saw he was paying no attention

i aint making no money said gravy
they dont pay me nothing here
listen said ates dont you make
nothing on the side-no pickings at all
sometimes i get something said
gravy but not often

  now listen said ates what about
today he poked gravy in his lean
ribs and made him grin ill make a
bet you turned a little something i can
tell by the way you look youve picked
up something that maybes not so bad
dont let that guy back of the counter
hear you said gravy hes down on
me he hates to see me make a cent
some pineapple commented ates
but listen whatd you collect today
i know youre a sharp old cheese but
you cant fool me youve turned some-
thing for yourself something nice
gravy grinned once more

  i made two- dollars he said
  how

  i aint saying anything i dont want
the cops onto me

  cops what they got to do with it
i didnt know they had anything to
do with it till afterward said gravy
not till id sold it i got two bucks
right down he looked toward the
barman and nobody else dont get
any of it

  did you steal something asked ates
no said gravy alarmed i dont
ever do that it was a pistol he said
in a whisper somebody threw it out
of the tower and it fell into the street-
cleaners truck i saw it fall and i got
it and i sold it he said then the
cops come around hunting and i heard
somebody had been shot

  what kind of a thing was it asked
ates was it an automatic-you know
flat and black

  yes said gravy and little
  whod you sell it to

  do you know joe nipper that drives
the cab

  whats he look like

  hes thick sometimes he fights in
places

  oh yes said ates i know who
you mean

  sometimes he stops here and eats
said gravy always on the days when
we have sour meat and dumplings well
he was in today and i thought maybe
him being a cab-tlriver hed like to have
a gun so i showed it to him  and
he said how much i said two bucks
and he gave it to me 	

  and afterward the cops came around
and you heard somebodyd been shot
yes said gravy and when i heard
it i was scared as hell

  well listen said ates what you
got to do is keep quiet dont tell
nothing to nobody if the cops heard
you had that gun youd be in a jam
keep shut tight you dont know any-
thing about any pistols at all -

when ates haley left the short or-
der cafe he hurried back to the of-
fice he let himself in with his key and
found the place empty he telephoned
several of jerrys customary stops but no
one knew anything of his movements
ates sweated and bit at his nails he
had to do something he had to get
mooneys in a jam

that gun mickey was locked up in city
hall and if the police got the auto-
matic shed be worse off than that he
couldnt forget how shed stood there by
the desk some hours before and taken
the weapon out of her handbag

  she did put it in the drawer ates
repeated to himself i saw her but
afterward she must have changed her
mind    mick didnt do it though   
just the same i want to get hold of that
gun if ihe police get it they might
find things out about it and that joe
nipper if he-

  i he telephone rang hello said
ates into it mooney proceedings
i want to speak to mr mooney
said a womans voice

  hes not in at present said ates
is there any message

  when will he be in

  i couldnt say ates told her hes
out on a case but maybe theres some-
thing i can do

  i must speak to him said the voice
ill call again and the phone clicked

  she had something said ates aloud
i could tell by the way she said her
words

  he gnawed at his nails and he again
thought of mickey in the hands of the
police he thought of the gun and he
thought of joe nipper a tough egg
he had fights in the ring where they
paid him to do it

  if i could get him and have a talk
but id only be a kid to him and hed
shove me away if i knew somebody
that was acquainted with him some-
body that-

  ates didnt finish he was up  his
feet had the phone receiver in his hand
and was dialing a number

  mr lotts he said when a voice had

thundered down the corridor and in at
the office door he put ates into a chair
with a strong hand and sat down in
front of him

  now break it he said what is
it and whos the guy

occupying a very solid spot in the
front of the boys mind was jerrys
warning-to say nothing to anyone and
so lie sparred cautiously

  you know he explained we got
office secrets here things come in
thatre other peoples business and weve
got to keep them under cover

sides that shes in the calabooza waiting

georgie

  georgie tightened his hands into fists
until they looked like mallets

sometimes fights

  georgie seemed pleased

   o k said sid

  ill get him in a few minutes said
sid and ill tell him

in a few minutes after leaving his oflice
jerry mooney was entering the etru-
ria the place had a gay-looking front
a marquee extending over the sidewalk
potted plants on the steps and a good
deal of pink-colored lighting in the lobby
and office jerry spoke to the clerk and
in a few moments was approached by
tweedy a medium-sized compact sort of
man with a sharp hard face

  hello said tweedy and didnt seem
any too pleased about it chubby said
you might be stopping in

  its just a little thing about this
sonya said jerry

  i know said tweedy but listen
mooney i dont like talking to cops-
any kind of cops-about people that live
in the house

  yeah  know said jerry ouite all
right too i dont blame you but this
thing in a way is between friends im
not pining to throw sonya in the can for
anything my principal notion is to get
someone out of it	--

well said tweedy sonya puts on
a good bit of heavy work around the
hotel and nobody likes her any too well
i understand said jerry shes not
very well fixed just now

  shes broke said tweedy when
that place the wranglers was closed she
hit bottom shes been playing them

high and low all up and down the line
but nobody falls any more her jewelry
went sometime ago about a week or so
back she sold some of her swellest clofhes
shes in on the house for three or four
months rent and the managers wonder-
ing what hes going to do about it
yeah said jerry and all that puts
her in a spot where certain things ive
got in mind might have started happen-
ing does she see klem often

  not here said the man but i un-
derstand she has him on the telephone
a good hit but about two nights ago
he did come in and ihey hail a lot of
words in her apartment so many of
them said tweedy that i had to ride
up to her floor and shush them

  i suppose you dont know what the
little squabble was about

  money grinned tweedy what
most battles is about but what kind of
money and how or where i didnt hear
if you want inside details on sonyas
personal troubles he said youd bet-
ter speak to freda

  whos she

  the switchboard girl i think shell
be willing shes been making faces at
sonya for a long time

  all right jerry said well go over
and speak to freda

  freda was dark and spectacular-look-
ing and she was quite willing to dis-
cuss sonya

  i used to be friendly with her she
said but i got over that sometime
ago awhile back she gave me such a
run-around that my heads still turning
if id been looking for anything from her
it mightnt have been so bad but i
wasnt she heard me sing one night in
a place where i sometimes go i was
doing a number that was terrible popu-
lar at the time and i will say for myself
i did make them take notice

  sonya comes up to me while i was
standing there with a crowd around me
freda went on and she says id handled
the song awful nice and she says she
thought i ought to be using my voice in
other ways besides in a telephone and
maybe she could get me a try-out at the
wranglers

  yes said jerry that was her club
at the time said freda i thought
it was nice of her  didnt know she was
just throwing a bluff for the crowd that
was around afterward when i found it
out i thought she was an awful louse
often said jerry you cant take
them at their words
the blue book magazine

  you never can said freda they
get you believing their stuff and then
they treat you something awful after
she spoke to me the way i just said 
started to practice the exercises  took
really got the whole neighborhood talk-
ing they thought some opera company
had made me an offer but did she ever
open her trap to me about anything
again not oncel shed go through
here with her nose in the air and look-
ing enough dressed-up to strangle her-
self but she never even whispered wran-
glers to me and so one night i spoke to
her and asked her what about the try-
out and she had the nerve to ask me
what try-out  right away i knew shed
been kidding me and i lit into her i
fried that doll to a turn said ihe switch-
board girl she was that surprised that
she couldnt say a word for a while but
when she got her breath you ought tove
heard her conversation she was that
common youd be astonished she had
the whole office here standing up lis-
tening

  yeah said jerry from things ive
heard shes got a lot of stuff

  ever since then said freda i aint
had any time for her when i heard the
wranglers had been closed and shed
gone broke i tried lo feel sorry for her
-though not too much but  couldnt
make even that

  do you know klem a friend of hers
asked jerry

  ive seen him a couple of times said
the girl and ive heard him talk over
the telephone often it seems he aint
nobodys fool what he told her most
times was that he didnt have the
money

  have you ever had a party named
sudler calling her asked jerry

  sudler said freda it seems to
me i do remember that name did he
talk rough kind of

  he would be a little that way said
jerry

   he one i think he might be said
the girl is in some kind of a jewelry
place

  thats him jerry told her

  well hes called her up a couple of
times lately said freda something
about business

  that interests me said jerry did
you hear what kind of business they
talked about

  it was some kind of a proposition
she wanted him to go into it with her
maybe another place like the wranglers

  what did sudler say

  he didnt see how he could do it he
said he hadnt any experience in the line
she had in mind

  when was the last time he called
here--

  today-it was somewhere around one
oclock maybe before or after

did you catch any of what he said
something had happened he was
excited somebody had beaten them to
something he wanted to see her right
away

  yes

  she got me to call a cab said freda
and she went through the office here
like a bat right out of some place she
was away for about an hour and when
she got back she was terrible nervous
and excited she didnt talk with anyone
but went right up to her room

  has she been out since then

  no

  any calls on the telephone or any
visitors

  none

  now wait said tweedy putting his
hand on jerrys arm here comes one
now

  and jerry casting his eye down the
length of the office saw eddie klem com-
ing in at the street door

  klem as he approached the telephone
desk saw jerry mooney and looked at
him fixedly

  how are you jerry said think of
seeing you here

  i thought said klem a sneer at
one corner of his mouth there was a
police call out for you

  so i understand jerry looked quite
cheerful it does beat all the things
they think of dont it

  sonya mr klem said freda he
nodded and she plugged in the room

  pash is no man to fool with said
klem

  yeah youd know that wouldnt
you said jerry hes knocked you
over a couple of times

  mr klems here said freda into the
telephone then she looked at klem
youre to go up she said fourth
floor as usual

klem moved away toward the eleva-
tor and jerry moved with him

  i might as well be going up too
jerry said im here on a little busi-
ness

  klem made no reply they stepped
into the small cagelike elevator when it
mooneys in a jam

got to the fourth floor the man got out
jerry followed right at his heels

  nice stretch of weather weve been
naving jerry suggested

  klem the hard look still in his eyes
and his mouth pressed tight shut in a
thin line walked down the corridor
he stopped at a door and touched a bell-
button the door opened and a tall
well-made blonde woman in an elab-
orate negligee appeared

  why eddie this is so nice she said
klem entered the room and jerry was
following when she added a sudden ice
in her voice i didnt know anyone was
with you

  there isnt said klem this big
mutts shoving himself in as he usually
does he looked at jerry menace in his
expression some of these days he
said youre going to step into a lot of
trouble

  jerry laughed he was now in the
room and had the door closed

  well as long as its not this after-
noon its all right he said but be-
tween the three of us id hate to get tan-
gled up just now ive got a lot of things
to do

  the woman had been staring at him
while he spoke and now she pointed at
the door

  get out of here she said and do
it right away

  id keep my wrap on if i were you
he told her you look awfully well in
it and besides thered be no use in me
going out because id only be coming
right back

  he moved farther into the room he
sat on the corner of a center table and
swung one foot looking at klem

  you kind of surprised me he said
i mean-seeing you here on this busi-
ness

  what business asked klem

  but jerry waved a hand in good-hu-
mored protest

   listen he said dont lets start that
kind of thing i know and you know
also-his look shifting to sonya-you
know so lets play on top of the table
and from the top of the deck its hitting
close to three oclock and ive got a kind
of an engagement to take a lady out to
dinner so what say if we dont waste any
time

  klem smiled crookedly

  if you mean the party im thinking
of he said youll hardly do it theyve
got her pretty well tied up maybe you
havent heard the news shes known to

have threatened malitoff and to have
bought a gun to do the job with
yeah said jerry ive heard that
aint it funny how these things get
around and often theres nothing to
them at all

sonya had kept on registering indig-
nation what do you want here 
she asked of jerry

well getting back to that he said
i stopped in to have a few words with
you but you know i cant get it out
of my mind how surprised i was to see
eddie come in while i was standing
downstairs i thought if itd be anyone
itd be sudler
for a moment there was silence the
woman turned white under her rouge
klems eyes went from one to the other
what do you mean sudler he said
jerry looked amused dont tell me
youve forgotten him your old strong-
arm guy the fellah that used to front
for you when the going got heavy
what about him

  well i didnt really expect him
jerry said but i did think if i ran in-
to anyone itd be him he looked at
sonya my idea he said was that
the job was between sudler and you
klem closed his eyes for an instant
then he said in a quiet voice

  as there seems to be something to
talk about we may as well sit down

  i wonder said sonya to jerry if
you havent had two or three too many
whats all this about expecting sudler
and especially whats this idea you have
about some kind of a job

   well you see said jerry affably as
i get to proceeding around little things
pop into my mind of course i dont
know if it was you mentioned the ruby
to sudler in the first place or he to you
what i mean is the burma ruby he
said to klem -the one they tried to pin
on me when it disappeared

  the look klem fixed upon the woman
was as ugly as jerry had ever seen she
said this big ape is having some kind
of a dream

  i never dream said jerry he
studied sonya you knew this chunk of
red ice was in malitoffs place didnt
you he asked her

how should i have known about it
well of course i wouldnt be sure
but sudler could have told you
listen said sonya for the second
time i want you to get out of here and
i want you to do it right now


the blue book magazine

  lets wait said jerry theres no
hurry anyway i havent told you whats
known as all i thought maybe after
id talked to you awhile youd hand the
stone over and id go quietly away
youve got a hell of a nerve to sit
there and say things like that said
sonya what do you think i am

  i never was good at guessing jerry
told her but you know the ruby is
missing and sudler called you about
one oclock or so and you slipped out to
meet him

  sonya looked at him scornfully

  hed taken it i suppose and wanted
to hand it over to me he said

  oh no it wouldnt be as coarse as
that my notion was that the job was
done by an independent party maybe
a woman and he wanted to tell you
where to find her it not being too safe to
mention such things over the lelephone
and after you lalked with him you went
around to wherever the place was and
you got the ruby and carried it away

sonya her hands clenched but with
fright in her eyes turned to klem
are you going to sit there and let this
man speak to me this way she said

  it sounds like an interesting line
said klem suppose we hear the rest of
it

  there is no more said jerry but
i thought id bring that much around
sos youd have some idea of how things
are working he got up from the table
and now he said to sonya suppose
you hand the thing over to me and ill
be going

  youre crazy said sonya

  if i figured up all the things ive been
called jerry told her that one would
be close up to the top he pulled open
a drawer and stirred up its contents
though of course you wouldnt have
it here he said most likely its in your
bathroom-or bedroom maybe under the
mattress thats a favorite place with
women for putting things they dont
want seen he closed the drawer and
opened another what im going to do
is go through the place he said one
thing after another what i hope-and
he nodded amiably to them-is that
youll not think im going too far

  klem said nothing the usual derision
in his eyes had deepened as he looked at
jerry but with sonya it was different

  nobodyll search my place she pro-
claimed stormily and if you dont
leave  at once ill call the police

  i wouldnt do that said jerry good-
naturedly and continued witli his in-
vestigation when they get into a place
they go nosing around something terri-
ble

  any more than youre doing said
sonya

  oh yes theyre different from me
when i get hold of a thing i can make
a little deal of some kind if the case calls
for it but they cant when they turn
up a find theyve got to make something
of it

  in a fury the woman snatched a heavy
brass candlestick from the table but
jerry smiled at her

  dont get rough he advised that
kind of thing might work with pet dogs
or with girls when their backs are
turned but ive been around too much
for it to have any effect on me

  the look of fright was again in the
womans eyes

  are you going to let this gorilla get
away with this she demanded of klem
i thought from the way youve always
talked you had something

  be wise said jerry to her at the
door of the bedroom dont ask too
much of a guy you know eddie went
into the red with an awlul smack when
the wranglers closed dont you and
youve been on his neck ever since he
disappeared into the bedroom and there
followed the sounds of further search
why not give him a chance jerrys
voice continued suppose he is part
owner of malitoffs does it follow that
you ought to grab off the best thing they
had in stock

  there was a sound of jerry moving
around then came the tinkle of broken
glass and a whistle of surprise the
woman moved swiftly toward the bed-
room door but klem stopped her

  the old light-fixture gag said jer-
rys voice well well and i almost
missed it

  let me go cried sonya struggling
with klem

  if theres nothing there he said to
her coldly what are you worrying
about

  do you expect me to stand still and
let that man paw over and break my
things

  before klem could make a reply to
this jerry reappeared buttoning up his
square-cut coat

  luck does get through he said with
a good deal of satisfaction in his voice
no matter how tough the going were
i

mooneys in a jam

sure to get a break somewhere along the
line he took up his hat and pulled it
jauntily down upon his head how
sorry i am for intruding this way he
said ill never be able to say he
grinned at sonya who was white and
shaking then he turned to klem
somehow he said i had a feeling
when i saw you downstairs that you were
going to be a help women are what is
called impulsive-you never know just
what theyll do but the man-influence
sometimes quiets them down hed
opened the hall door by this time and
now waved a hand ill be seeing you
he said but maybe not again today
times short and packed tight with
things to do

  the door closed upon him and there
was silence then sonya turned a bitter
look upon klem and said

  if the thing he said happens to be
true-if there was such a thing here as a
stolen jewel are you going to allow him
to walk out with it and not lift a hand

  he looked at her and his eyes were
like ice

  i have no idea what was here he
said but if he has walked out with
the thing he spoke of lies carrying dyna-
mite every police-car crew and every
patrolman in the city is looking for him
at this minute and hes sure to be nabbed
somewhere along the line

a half-block from the etruria jer-
ry mooney went into a phone-booth
and called sids place he wanted chub-
by and it was chubby who answered

  ive been waiting here knowing id
hear from you said chubby the
last time i called your place the police
were there

  i thought they might be whats the
news

  i think id better see you some place
said chubby theres quite a bundle
to pass on to you what about georgie
lotts

  no said jerry they know geor-
gies a friend of mine and maybe would
have a man with his eye on the front
door what do you say to the fish-
chowder place in moleyne street

  right said chubby

  when jerry reached the place a nar-
row doorway with a long passage open-
ing into a big bare room at the back
there was a fat black man shucking
oysters at a small bar and another one
even fatter and blacker was serving fish
chowder chubby came in a few mo-
ments later jerry ordered beer and
cigarettes and they settled down in a
corner

  what is it asked jerry after a mo-
ments silence

  sid told me that about an hour ago
hed had a call from your office-from
ates it was about a gun

yeah said jerry whatd he say
he said for me to go to ciggys bar-
gain basement the gun had been sold
there by a party called joe nipper and
for me to get it

  but it seemed that sid hadnt found
him until a half-hour had passed and
when he reached ciggys place the police
had been there before him

  for the gun said chubby and
they got it

what did ates say about the gun
howd he know about this joe nipper
chubby related the story of the boys
experiences and how hed called on
georgie for help in dealing with nipper

  georgie was the trouble said jerry
he put the squeeze on when he
shouldnt have and then the guy called
up the police he considered awhile
did you speak to ciggy about what
kind of gun it was

  right away i did i always make
sure about things like that ciggy told
me it was a shanley automatic a
twenty-two ciggy told me hed looked
at it pretty close because hed seen a
shanley a good bit like that one before
in his mind jerry mooney pictured
the small dark glistening weapon hed
seen in mickeys handbag it might very
well have been a shanley also a 

  just a minute he said to chubby
he went to a phone-booth at the end of
the bar dialed a number and closed the
door

  mr curren please he said as an
answer came this is important

  after an interval he heard currens
voice

  hello steve he said this is a
friend of yours

  so i hear said curren none too en-
thusiastically

  has the coroners report come in
especially has the laboratory put through
the bullets found in the body
the blue book magazine

  the coroners report was as usual
said curren the police laboratory so
far has only said the slugs were small
twenty-two

  nothing about the gun

  it was an automatic that was all
jerry thanked curren then he went
back to chubby and asked

  when you were asking about sudler
did you find out where he lives

  yeah in that place they call the
cleveland house a kind of polished-lip
flop-joint

  i know it said jerry he took a
package from a pocket this is for
doxey he said find out what shell
give for it

  the ice asked chubby

  yeah get as much as you can if
theres any over we got places for it
he talked on with chubby for some
time then he left the fish-chowder place
and cut through the back streets took a
street-car and finally reached the estab-
lishment known as the cleveland house
it ran a good deal to polished brass and
wide spreads of shining window-glass it
was a stopping-place for people not al-
together broke but verging upon that
condition behind a brass cage with an
opening let into it was a small man with
thin sandy hair parted in the middle
and with paper tfuffs drawn up over his
sleeves

  what can i do for you sir he in-
quired softly

  id like to speak to mr sudler said
jerry

  mr sudler is not in he is not here
during the day

i think said jerry hes in now
what about sending up a little call
the clerk held up a finger-and a
colored boy in a showy livery came for-
ward

  has mr sudler come in asked the
clerk in a low murmur

  is mr sudler that genlman in 
  yes

  no suh the boy said mistah sud-
ler aint in

  not in murmured the clerk to jerry

jerry turned away there was an
archway opening from the office into
a wide mirror-framed lobby this had
a red floor-covering and a large num-
ber of imitation-leather-covered chairs
at the rear he had noticed as he came in
a flight of steps led upward to turn
to the right would bring him to the door
and out so jerry turned to the left

  the boy had mentioned sudlers room
as  that would be the third floor and
well toward the front the stairs lead-
ing to the third floor were narrower than
those leading to the second the hall
also was narrower and there were two
rows of white-painted doors with brass
numbers upon them at  jerry
paused and following his custom he
tried the door it was not locked and he
walked in a burly man with ears and
brows distorted by fistic pounding stood
in the middle of the floor buttoning on
a shirt he paused in the operation and
looked at jerry

  what do you want he demanded
pardon me for bouncing in on you
this way said jerry remember who
i am

  yeah said sudler but dont you
ever knock when you come in places
well do you know said jerry i
never gave that a thought he closed
the door and stood with his back to it
looking exceedingly cheerful but i
had a few words for you and i thought
id step in and drop them in your ears
the last time i saw you said sudler
you were going out of a place with a
couple of cops shoving you and if you
dont scram out of here under your own
steam big boy this time itll be me doing
the shoving and let me say when i
shove i shove hard

  i wouldnt wonder said jerry still
keeping the cheerful expression you
look like a party thats bulled around a
good bit but at the same time you
look as if you got your share of slams in
the puss however what say if we dont
go into that right now ive got some
talk for you awhile ago i was speaking
to a lady friend of yours and it popped
into my mind id better interview you
also

  who were you talking to

  sonya around at the etruria
sudler turned up his shirt-collar ad-
justed his tie under it

  what was she saying he asked
what could it be but something
about what happened at malitoffs this
noon and also about the way you got
agitated afterward and went out and
telephoned

  sudler pointed to a chair

  sit down he said

  jerry sat astride the chair facing sud-
ler and he took out cigarettes

  sonya told you id telephoned her
did she said the man as he put a knot
in the tie


mooneys in a jam

  oh no said jerry he selected a
cigarette i saw her but she didnt tell
me anything id heard about the tele-
phoning before i saw her

  sudler grinned at him like an ugly-
tempered dog

  when i saw you lugged out of mali-
toffs by ihe police he said i figured
you were another of those big dubs that
cant keep out of trouble he put on
his vest and began to button it up but
now i see maybe youve got some stuff
who told you id telephoned

  jerry put this aside

  i trade sometimes he told sudler
but i never give things away its work-
ing around in my mind youve got some
information thatd clear up this shoot-
ing my idea is if you let me have enough
of that to do some good you and mell
start getting friendly

udler looked at him fixedly

what are you interested in me for
he asked

  im interested in anything that hap-
pened at or around malitoffs today
about noon said jerry now look
here i go into that place to see some un-
set stones-just because looking at them
makes me feel good and then-bingo
-all of a sudden im in the hands of the
police also i have my name and my
picture in the paper

  what are you stopping there for
said sudler with his ugly grin what
about the girl that friend of yours
who shot a couple of holes in malitoff
just now said jerry ive got the
ruby on my mind maybe thats because
sonyas been thinking so much about it
maybe its whats called thought-transfer-
ence anyway id like to hear you say
just why right after the shooting you
went outside somewhere and called
sonya on the telephone

  did she say i did

  listen jerry said im just after
telling you she said hardly anything the
party who gave about your phone-call
was someone else and i might add i
got the time of the call and the number
of the taxi sonya took when she went to
see you

  sudler stared a moment then said
what i wanted to do when i called
was give her the news of what had hap-
pened

  jerry laughed encouragingly

  well anyway he said thats an
effort but it dont get far with me and
id say itd sound even flatter to the



police what did you mean when you
said to sonya that somebody had got to
the ruby first

  i never said it sudler was suddenly
excited whatd i say a thing like that
for

  thats what im asking you grinned
jerry and you must have told her
some other things too when you saw
her if you didnt what made her go
hopping around paying little visits-one
of them especially to a party that had a
little dog

  sudler shut his big hands tightly but
just as he was about to speak the tele-
phone rang he took it up oh yeah
come on up he said  was just think-
ing about you and ive got a couple of
things to say

  dont tell me its sonya jerry said
enjoyingly as he waved away the smoke
from his cigarette

  shell be up in a minute said sudler
menacingly and then ill have a little
show-down with you

  sonya looking extremely blonde and
stately appeared a few moments later
she halted in the open doorway and
looked at jerry with startled eyes

  it surely is queer how people run into
each other aint it said fie agreeably

  the woman came into the room and
sudler closed the door after her

  what i said he told her was that
i was just thinking about you but what
i should have said was that i was talking
about you he indicated jerry do
you know this big ape he asked

  he came into my apartment this
afternoon said sonya and he gave
me a lot of talk

  what about asked sudler

  he said i had a ruby the one she
said the police had him up for taking
he said all kinds of dirty things to me
what i should have done-resentfully
-was to have appealed to the police
i think you mentioned that said
jerry dont you remember i said if
you once got them in you wouldnt be
able to get rid of them theyre always
rummaging around and you never know
what theyll turn up itd been a risk
i told you so at the time

  sudler glowered heavily he looked
from sonya to jerry and then back again
at the woman

  after you left me this afternoon he
said to her where did you go

  as soon as i got through with my
shopping she answered i went back to
the hotel
the blue book magazine

  and you did some visiting too didnt
you suggested jerry remember we
were talking about that the girl with
the little dog-you know on a leash
sonya looked at jerry with cold scorn
from the way you sound that big
head of yours must be awful soft she
said then she turned to sudler i
came up here to have a talk she said
especially about this man here he
came into the hotel and began to ask
questions fie said-

  now wait said sudler his battered
face heavy with suspicion before we
get to that lets hear about the girl and
the dog i talked to you about people
that was in the store at the time the
trouble was on today and i mentioned a
girl that had a dog i said to you she
was the only one in the place i knew
anything about but that she didnt get
there until after the ruby was stolen
you did say something about a girl
said sonya but i didnt know her
you mentioned her name but it didnt
mean anything to me i didnt know
where she lived or anything about her
visiting she said wrathfully to jerry
its a wonder to me they let you go out
alone

  well of course he said if you say
you didnt why i dont know when i
mentioned her i was just repeating what
id heard the girl i mean he said to
sudler is named cora when i saw
her about an hour or so ago she was
in the hospital with her head tied up
cora said sudler did she tell you
that was her name

  yeah and she said shed got the
hurt head through a woman wrho had
dropped in at her apartment for a
friendly cup of tea or something and
cora says while she wasnt noticing the
dame bent what felt like a piece of rail-
road iron over her head

  its a lie stormed sonya i never
even saw her

  of course as i just said jerry told
her i dont know only the descrip-
tion the girl gave me was so close i
thought id run around and find out
what you knew about the thing

  didnt i tell you she couldnt have
taken the ruby said sudler to sonya
didnt i so what the hell did you
have to go around and beat her up for
and have the police looking for you
the police said sonya contemptu-
ously they never find anybody thats
got any sense theyre even worse than
this big-pretzel here

  talking about someone not having
any sense said sudler to sonya you
dont have too much yourself how
could that girlve got away with the ruby
when it was gone before she got into the
placed why didnt you try somebody
that had a chance if you wanted to get to
work why didnt you sock klem if you
thought-

  sudler stopped suddenly and jerry
looked at the woman she was gazing at
sudler her face like stone

  i might have thought of him she
said if hed been at malitoffs today
but he wasnt

   there was a pause and jerry realized
sudler was groping about hurriedly in
his mind

  i know said the man and a girl
that didnt get to the place until after
the stuff was stolen hadnt any more
chance to steal it than somebody like
klem who wasnt there at all

   as jerry a little later stepped down
j the carpeted stairs and through the
mirrored lobby he pulled things alertly
together in his mind

   a slippery dame said jerry shes
stringing them both klem didnt know
she was dealing on the side with sudler
and sudler didnt know shed listened so
close to what hed told her that shed
seen a thing hed never even thought of
also klem was at malitoffs about the
lime of the happenings that big plow-
horse was just on the point of saying
klem was there when she stopped him
a block along the way jerry slipped
into a chinese restaurant in a phone-
booth he called for gootch and got him
instantly

  i thought you might call said the
man i see the heat grows worse all
the time pretty soon im afraid theyll
catch up with you

   listen said jerry did you speak to
the doorkeeper when you were at mali-
toffs was it him gave you the informa-
tion about what people were there about
the time of the happenings

   yes and the police got their informa-
tion from him too

  theres a clock record on the door
isnt there


mooneys in a jam

  yes no one goes in or out at these
place without it is seen on the tape its
a ribbon of paper like in an adding-ma-
chine or a cash-register everything is
there plain as a newspaper

  you didnt see this ribbon

  oh yes the doorkeeper had been
showing it to the police i looked at it
very good

  did you check up on it person for
person as they came in with the time
and everything

  there were places where the paper
was broken a couple of them the
man said hes nervous and excited when
he took it out of the machine and hed
torn it but it was pieced together i
saw it all

  all right jerry said thats about
what i expected

  if the police pick you up said
gootch what am i to do

  stay close to the phone thats all i
can say jerry told him i may call
you any minute

  after hed put down the receiver he
hunted out the call number at the back
door of the elysium theater

  hello i want tony he said after
hed made the connection

  this is tony

  tony this is mooney  i want to
know if there was anyone around looking
for the gun that was tossed out of the
window across the street from you
five six police they all looked re-
plied tony

  was there anyone else-not a police-
man asked jerry

  i got a man here that says he talked
with somebody it was a somebody who
gave him five bucks nobody com-
plained tony ever comes around with
anything while im at the door

  i hats the way it goes said jerry
some guys have all the luck but any-
way tony some day ill be seeing you
and ill build you tip a little

  jerry put down the telephone and
went out the man who had spoken to
benny might have been klem but who-
ever it was in return for the payment
of five dollars hed been sent to gravy
gravy in turn was sure to have directed
him to nipper the cabman cliubby
had told jerry the location of the rack
where nipper hung his cab and jerry
proceeded there at once

  which of these drivers is joe nip-
per he asked a hotel doorman

  the man pointed to nipper sitting in
his compartment smoking a cigarette

jerry opened the door and stepped into
the cab

  get going he directed

  nipper looked at him suspiciously but
he started the motor

  where to he asked

  city hall they had gone only a
few blocks however when jerry told
him to pull in at the curb he handed
nipper a bill and kept the wallet in
plain view who he asked was the
man who came to see you and asked what
you did with the gun you bought in mc-
caldrum street

  there wasnt anybody asked me
said nipper

  jerry took another bill out of the wal-
let and held it so that the man coidd
see its denomination

  this is private business he said
not police

  eddie klem asked me a few ques-
tions nipper told him and i said i
sold it to ciggy that keeps the place in
vine street

  o k said jerry he passed the bill
to nipper take me to about a couple
of blocks from ciggys shop

  within ten minutes jerry was descend-
ing some dirty stone steps that led to a
naitow low basement there was a
clutter of secondhand goods of all sorts
and at a work-bench was a thin sickly-
looking man tinkering at a lock

  how are you said jerry

  the man looked at him in surprise
hello mooney he said aint seen
you in a long time

  what might happen grinned jerry
is that maybe if tilings dont break a
little right for me it might be longer still
before you see me again

  that said ciggy sounds like some
kind of trouble

jerry leaned against the work bench
and looked about i hear you had
the police here awhile ago he said
well theres nothing new about
that ciggy said i have them every
day in the week about something

  it was about a  automatic jerry
said a shanley chubby was telling
me about it

  yeah he was here he didnt say
who sent him was it you

  jerry nodded

  it was him told me about the police
was anyone else in asking about the
gun

  yeah a man came in to see about it a
little while after id given it up


the blue book magazine

  did you know him

  no

  sure wasnt it eddie klem

  it wasnt he was a big pot id say
about sixty or so inches around the mid-
dle and he had a way of talking that
made me want to sock him

  klems office man alonzo jerry in-
stantly had a picture of this peremptory
person in his mind

did he want to buy he asked ciggy
yeah and he was sore as hell because
id turned it over he wanted to know
why i didnt cover up for a while until i
seen what was going on

  a shanley automatic  said jerry
its a shooter you dont often see
there were only a few thousand
made and its hard to get ammunition
for them now the stuff for other 
automatics dont fit

  you never saw this copy before i sup-
pose said jerry

  nobody can be in this business and
talk much if he does he soon finds hes
buying little and selling less

  you have seen it then said jerry
this is a police thing said ciggy
and the police always mean trouble for
someone

  the party im talking for said jerry
is already in trouble and im for get-
ting her out of it

  well said ciggy i had that gun
once before i knew it as soon as i
looked at it because it had the number
cut out of it it was a very neat job and
id taken special notice of it

  who did you sell it to

  guns said ciggy are things i al-
ways get rid of as soon as i can because
when theyre brought in here theyre
always hot i sold that one to max
korn

  how long ago

  i couldnt say maybe six months
but i remember max made a talk about
it it was too small the people that
come to him for guns mostly want the
kind you blast with

  jerry looked at his watch
four-twenty he said some of the
races are still coming in i wonder if
maxd be at foleys

  he mostly is about this time

ewing ciggys basement jerry cut
through side-streets at an old of-
fice-building he ascended to the top floor
in the heavy slow-moving elevator and
went in at a door upon which was let-
tered office countiy club a thick-

shouldered young man in his shirt-sleeves
greeted him in a room gray with smoke
and crowded with men

  hiyah jerry

  hello phil anything going on
two more races if you want to
play-theres still time

  ive got a little business said jerry
is max korn around

  yeah i think so but listen i had
two of pashs people in awhile ago ask-
ing for you i understand the words
gone out about you

  so they tell me said jerry cheer-
fully but you know pash goes dull
every once in a while and this is one
of the occasions

  id say this thing about the girl must
be kind of jerking you around the
boys that were in here seemed to think
they had her practically indicted
they always take their stuff from
pash said jerry -ie yells and they
believe but im going to have her out
of the calabooza by nightfall

  well good luck said foley shes
a nice kid and i dont want any of their
talk to be true -theres korn now
max korn was a barrel-like young
man with a head covered with heavy
black ringlets he had a round face like
a clock and he talked loudly

  get the pressure down said jerry
as he led him aside because were going
to talk about something private

  its going to be about this trouble
youre in said max confidently and
im telling you right away i dont want
any part of it i cant-afford to get under
anything i got all i can do to hold up
what ive got already

  all i want is a word or two said
jerry between you and me i was
around at ciggys place just now and i
was talking with him about a gum
me said max i wouldnt know one
gun from another i never handle them
jerry grinned listen he said
dont you think youd better give
that way youll have no trouble itll be
one pal with another the gun we were
mentioning was the one somebody used
on this malitoff

  you get into a conversation with me
said max all right i cant help that
what im asking is what have i got to
do with it

  as far as the trigger-work goes said
jerry youre out in the clear and clean
as a whistle but the gun is something
else ciggy once sold you that shooter
he didnt say so to the police when they


mooneys in a jam

were around at his place but he told me
-because he knew it was the best thing
to do

  sometimes i buy things said max
a lot of things together and i dont al-
ways know whats in it all there may
have been a gun in some goods i got
from this ciggy one time i couldnt
say

  youll remember this one said jerry
because you and ciggy had some talk
about it a shanley  you said
there was no sale for small guns

  oh yes said max that shanley
i do remember that quite a while ago
it was thats when hevy worked lor
me it was him bought it and i tell him
hes a sap for bringing it in i says to
him now youve got it lets see you
sell it 

  did he

  sure said max hevy wasnt a bad
salesman a woman bought it

  jerry fixed him with intent eyes you
wouldnt have the womans name would
you max he asked

  i wouldnt said max hevy might
remember but where the hell is he i
havent seen him for months

  for a while longer jerry talked with
max theihe went to a phone-booth in a
side room called the etruria hotel and
got tweedy

  this is mooney he said ive been
thinking about what you told me this
afternoon about the night you had to go
up to sonyas room and put down a riot
you mean between her and eddie
klem

  yes what went on there was
there any heavy slugging

  that sonya was awful sore a dame
like her most always gets that way when
the wallets tied up and she cant get
into it

  she didnt go so far as to pull any-
thing like a gun on him

  howd you know that said tweedy
surprised

  after i talked with her awhile i
thought she looked like somebody thatd
do a thing like that

  well youre right said the house
detective when i got into the -room
she was laying plenty words on klem
according to her he was a prize heel
he didnt make much noise with his
answers but when he spoke what he
said must have hurt anyway she got
a gun out from under a sofa pillow i
tried to grab it but klem got there be-
fore me he shoved it in his pocket

  a small gun jerry inquired

   a little automatic

  jerry finished with tweedy and dialed
another number in a few moments he
had gootch and said

  the last time you were at malitoffs
you talked to some of the people who
worked there didnt you

  most of them said gootch id
have gone through them all if it hadnt
been for the police

  i know said jerry that youve got
a habit of taking down addresses that
fellah that had the designing and reset-
ting job and worked in the room next
malitoffs i hope you covered him
ill see said gootch there was a
pause and then came the voice once
more i have him in the book he is
isidor plutstine and he lives in hay-
mount street the number is 

  i know the street said jerry keep
where you are i may call you soon

jerry took a street-car transferred to
another and finally got off at a street
crowded with dealers in poultry in
cheese and eggs with bottlers and oil
and hide merchants haymount street
was a narrow one-car way crowded with
small houses and filled with the shouts of
energetic children he knocked at the
door of  a woman with her head
wrapped in a shawl spoke to him from
a ground-floor window

  plutstine is never home in daytime
she told jerry he works at night
youll find him when you go inside and
ring the bell with his name on it

  jerry did not wait for the coming of
night he went into the hall saw the bell
with plutstines name on it and rang it
and a voice shouted for him to come up

  plutstine was a tall thin young man
with a shock of upstanding red hair that
had begun to recede at the forehead
jerry remembered seeing him at mali-
toffs when hed revisited the place

  how are you he said everything
all right

  youre the fellah that was arrested
out of the store today plutstine said

  right said jerry you remember
things dont you yes im the fellah
that thing happened to but dont forget
the blue book magazine

im also the fellah they let go because
they hadnt anything on him

  what do you want asked plutstine
  a few words with you

  about the murder what else could
i say that the police didnt ask me not
any more said plutstine violently will
i tell anybody anything

  i know what you mean those boys
get awful rough when theyre working on
a case they never think of a witness
feelings

  im not a witness stated plutstine
dont think it i didnt see anything i
should be a witness about

  all right said jerry agreeably but
i dont want you as a witness all i want
is a little information-any little thing
you can tell me you didnt see the
robbery you didnt see the murder i
know that but you may have seen a few
things thatll put some light on them
what say if we sit down and give matters
a talking-over you know he said as
he saw refusal in the young mans face
theres a girl in this shes being held by
the police and shes not guilty of any-
thing i want to get her clear

some of the scowl departed from
   plutstines face and he said

  right away when i saw her i knew
she was a fine girl and extra shes
good-looking he opened a door and
went in jerry followed there was a bed
and some chairs and a work-bench at a
window any time at all said plut-
stine ill do something thatll keep
anybody out of trouble

  jerry and the young man sat down
jerry took out his cigarettes they each
lighted one and began to smoke

  you set the stones for malitoff i
hear said jerry and designed sellings
plutstine said that had been his work
anti i have done good work he said
for a long time but what did i get for
it look he said and waved a hand
around the room this is where i live
i should get wages sos i could have two
rooms and maybe a bath malitoff was
ijo good he said i worked nights for
him as well as daytime and he paid me
not so much as he paid the doorman
thats the way it goes said jerry
sometimes they dont appreciate what a
person does pie puffed at his cigarette
you worked in the room next to the one
malitoff used didnt you

  yes plutstine said just next to
him where he could lock the door on me
when i had some stones to set that were

worth money he didnt trust me he
didnt trust anybody

  what about sudler said jerry did
he trust him

  him he didnt trust at all declared
plutstiwe all the time they had words
with each other

  i wonder why malitoff kept him on
the job said jerry

  he had to said plutstine when
you got a partner the partner has often
something to say about things

  klem wanted sudler in the place
did he said jerry

  he made malitoff give him a job
a couple of times they had a fight about
it

  klem and malitoff didnt always hit
off together then

  lately said plutstine they were
not friendly klem wasnt doing good
but he was a partner with malitoff in
other things-what i dont know-and
sudler worked for them how anybody
would give work to a man like that i
wouldnt understand averred plutstine
he is dangerous

  how do you mean dangerous
he fights always he has the fist up
even malitoff he threatened and said
plutstine hes not such a friend to
klem more than once ive heard him
tell what was in his mind for that fellah
it wasnt nice

  and you say that klem and malitoff
werent hitting it off together either
what was the trouble-outside sudler
money klem wanted plenty money
and malitoff said no also he called
klem things but never said plutstine
did they talk loud every time they
made their fights private which is a
good way then nobody knows your
business

  but you knew about it said jerry
how could i help it im in the
next room working or should i put
things in my ears today said plut-
stine they had a fight but never have
i heard them so extra quiet sudler was
there and i heard him trying to make
them friends once they were whisper-
ing and i got frightened right away it
was so terrible i thought maybe they
would kill each other so i got up and
went to the door thats between the two
offices to give a look

  you couldnt hear but you wanted
to see said jerry

  on a coat-hanger near the door said
plutstine was klems overcoat id seen
him put it there awhile before when i

mooneys in a jam

was in malitoffs room as i stood by
the doorway thats all i could sec-the
coat and extra the thing it hung on
and then i saw sudlers hand-i know it
was sudlers because its thick and hairy
and couldnt be anyone elses and it
went into the pocket of klems overcoat
and took out a pistol

  a pistol said jerry steadily and
then what

  there was nothing i thought there
might be but there wasnt it was just
talk and then klem went away

  he went away before malitoff was
shot

  he wasnt in the place when that
happened after they had the fight and
called each other things he went away
youre sure of that are you

  im positive absolutely afterward
i was in malitoffs room and then i was
in the store and j didnt see him

  it was sudler that took the gun said
jerry

  also i am positive of that but-how
am i to know if he kept it or not may-
be he took it so klem wouldnt have it
while he was mad and maybe he gave it
back to him when he cooled off

  the last person you know to have the
pistol was sudler

  yes said plutstine but he didnt
shoot it sudler is no friend of mine
he always says things about me but
when the pistol went off in malitoffs
room sudler was at the door where his
job is i saw him there when i heard
the shot right away i looked to see if
he would put the lock on the door so no
one could get out and he did when
there was the second shot he was still
there after that i saw him running
toward malitoffs office door

  youre sure you dont know if he
had the pistol

  how could i tell maybe like i said
he gave it back to klem maybe he gave
it to malitoff and maybe malitoff shot
himself

  but jerry shook his head

  if he had the gun would have been
there when they found him

lutstine agreed this seemed xp be
so but funny things happen in
murders he said when i read about
them it says you never can tell

yeah jerry said and you cant
but listen how much of this that youre
telling me have you told to the police
i answered questions all the time
said plutstine i told them the truth

but-with a grin-for why should i
tell them what they dont ask when i got
a friend a reporter on a paper who
makes it a scoop in the morning

  isidore-jerry grinned-youre not
dumb but let me hear this whats the
idea of telling it to me

  plutstine gestured

  aint i seen in the papers that youre
a friend of the girl whats in trouble by
the police also aint i told you al-
ready that shes nice-and in addition
that shes good-looking

for a few minutes longer jerry chat-
ted when he went downstairs and
out into the street again he had a new
look of determination on his face from
a public pay-station he called a phone-
n umber

  is this doxeys he asked he was
told it was and then he said if chub-
bys there put him on the phone
chubby was there and in a few mo-
ments spoke in jerrys ear

  have you made the deal jerry
asked

  all straight said chubby shell
pay eight grand

  o k you know what to do with the
six and you know how to get it there

  same as with the other people said
chubby

  yes and the two youve got over-
what place was it mickey laid the next
money over was to go to

that home for crippled children
right said jerry send it there
right away special delivery and put
in a note that its from a party who dont
want to be known

  yeah said chubby all right
have you got anything else for me
there was a message from the boy
before i left sids said chubby he
says theres been a woman trying to get
you on the telephone shes been calling
all afternoon she wouldnt say any-
thing but the boy at last got her to give
her name-its nora do you know her
o k said jerry ill look into it
within ten minutes he was in the used-
gown shop that carried the name of
hortense nora burns her eyes red
and speaking in a frightened broken
voice took him into her little office

  oh im glad youve come she said
i called and called you but no one
knew where you were

  pash has made kind of a tramp out of
me said jerry bitterly ive got to
keep on the move


the blue book magazine

  i read in the paper-ive been buying
every edition all afternoon-that they
were after you said nora and it
scared me every time i called your of-
fice i was afraid the police were there
and i was afraid to say anything

  you calling me as often as that said
jerry makes me think youve got some-
thing to say

  i have said nora when i read
that the police had found the pistol
malitoff was killed with and that it was
mickeys i was almost crazy i knew
shed bought a pistol not long after shed
said what she meant to do to malitoff
but i thought as shed said no more
about him for so long that shed for-
gotten about the thing and maybe got
rid of it

  how do you know she bought a pis-
tol asked jerry she tell you

  no but i knew the man she bought
it from he told me

  yeah said jerry all right and
then what

  when she came here this morning
said nora and told me she was keeping
her promise to tell me if she ever made
up her mind to go any place malitoff
was i was that frightened i was sick
 tried to persuade her sobbed nora
burns but she wouldnt listen she
seemed determined and then she said
good-by and started to go when she
got to the door said nora she stopped
and came back she asked me about
some shoes id spoken to her about when
she first came in she wanted to know if
i was sure they were the size id said
it seemed kind of queer to me that she
should be thinking of such a thing as
shoes at that time but i went to the
back of the shop where i keep them and
looked then i came back and told her
and what did she do then

  i remember she smiled at me then
she said good-by again and went out
jerry sat looking at the woman specu-
lation in his eyes

  all that seemed kind of odd to you
he said you got thinking about it
yes i did said nora burns i got
thinking and wondering it seemed to
me what shed done just before she went
out meant something but i couldnt
make out what it might be

  when i was here awhile ago said
jerry you didnt mention this

  i didnt think it was important then
said nora but little by little it came
to me that shed asked about the shoes
not because she was interested in them

but because she wanted me to go back
into the shop where i couldnt see her
and while i was away there was some-
thing she wanted to do

  yeah said jerry i see what you
mean

  there were only two things as far
as i was able to see that shed want to
do the first was that she wanted to
take something but i put that out of
my head right away mickeys a good
girl

   what was the second one said jerry

  she wanted to hide something she
had something she didnt want to take
with her she wanted to leave it here
and didnt want me to know

   did you find that was the fact he
asked

  she was standing right about where
you are sitting i was only gone a mo-
ment and she hadnt much chance to
move very far so when i thought she
might have hidden something i began
to search and here said nora burns
in this desk drawer where i keep my
account-books dropped down between
two of them i found this

   as she spoke she lifted a newspaper
that lay upon her desk and there small
black and full of deadly competence lay
a  shanley automatic

jerry mooney sat looking at the
weapon as it sparkled in the light 
nora burns desk he picked it up
it was fully loaded it looked new on
the band of metal that ran around the
butt a number was deeply bitten

  you think mickey put this in your
desk drawer he said

  it must have been mickey who
else could it have been i had all my
books out this morning-i go over them
in the morning because i have more
time people dont begin to come in be-
fore ten oclock

  you had all the books out and the
gun wasnt there

   it wasnt if it had been id most
surely have seen it when i opened the
drawer to search for what mickey might
have hidden it was the first thing i saw
all right said jerry i think weve
got something he put the gun care-


mooneys in a jam

fully down upon die desk have you
handled it much

  no said nora because id heard
about fingerprints at first i was going
to wipe it off with a cloth but then 
got frightened i thought about what
id best do sos to help mickey then
it came to me that she hadnt done any-
thing with the pistol and so to wipe off
the fingerprints might do her harm

  it would have said jerry the gun
theyve got at headquarters is likely the
one that killed malitoff but it doesnt
belong to mickey her fingerprints here
if any will go a long distance toward
proving that this one does belong to
her

  oh i hope sol said nora fervently
i hope so indeed

  a few moments ago said jerry you
said you knew the man who sold mickey
the pistol some time ago would his
name be hevy

  no said nora

  it wouldnt be korn

  no said the woman it was leo-
pold who keeps that little hardware and
sporting-goods place

  leopold eh and he sold it to her
right over the counter

  yes thats what he said

  jerry got up

  all right nora he said i think
this is the break ive been honing for
twice in the half-dozen blocks he had
to go jerry saw policemen but they were
of the settled unimaginative type who
troubled themselves only with routine
things and he got by them without
much difficulty at leopolds place he
talked with the gray-haired spectacled
proprietor at the far end of his small
crowded store

  i read the things said about the mali-
toff murder in the afternoon papers and
i have been expecting a visit from the
police said leopold it is a terrible
thing  was shocked

  no one has been here yet asking
about it inquired jerry

  no one but i suppose there will be
and i will have to testify at the trial
and i am sorry the girl is a nice girl
it is too bad	-

  when did she buy the gun from you
asked jerry

  one evening just seven months ago
ive looked it up in my books she came
in and asked for a small automatic i
was surprised she had often been here
to get tnings and i had come to know
her said leopold i asked her why

she wanted a thing like that she said
she felt she ought to have one in her
room for protection so i took down
her name and address look said the
dealer taking a book down from a shelf
and opening it here is the entry there
is a routine as i suppose you know be-
fore delivering the weapon to the pur-
chaser the merchant must send the name
and address to police headquarters here
you will see is the date when i did that
if the police find there is nothing against
the person whose name has been given
they send a permit the note giving that
permission said leopold pointing to a
date written at the bottom of the entry
is here

  jerry studied the history of the trans-
action then he wrote down the dates on
the back of an envelope took out the au-
tomatic which hed got from nora burns
and handed it to the man saying

  be careful of the fingerprints is this
the automatic you sold her

  a shanley said leopold a 
he looked at the butt and the num-
ber is the same ive got here he looked
at jerry over the rims of his glasses
there can be no doubt of it this is the
identical piece

things were meanwhile happening
at headquarters

  we have every respect for the district
attorneys office said captain pash in a
voice that plainly indicated that he per-
sonally had none at all and we want
to get along with it as agreeably as pos-
sible but also we must have a chance
to get on with the business of the police
department

  the idea was said assistant district
attorney curren smoothly that wed
leave all questioning of the girl until
tomorrow

  pash pointed his long chin belligerent-
ly at the young attorney

  that arrangement was made before
wed reached the spot where the case
now stands he said at that time we
hadnt the gun we hadnt the full police
laboratory report	

  mooney said curren is looking
around why not give him a chance to
do a little something

  mooney declared pash is a party
to this murder and as you know judge
andersons release of him has ceased to
ride

  well why not wait until your people
bring him in then you can talk to the
girl and to him also
the blue book magazine

  we havent got him said pash but
we have got her also weve got a defi-
nite case and we want to fasten it down
so tomorrows newspapers will have no
doubt about whats happened

  very well said curren with a ges-
ture if you must i suppose you must
so lets have it

 they went into the room where
mickey sat reading she looked up

  its all right curren said to her
but captain pash thinks he ought to
speak to you

  mickey looked at pash shed listened
to his tirades over the telephone a hun-
dred times

  i hope she said its something in-
teresting

  you might find its a good bit more
than that pash replied youve been
pretty lucky since youve been brought
in anyone else-anyone who hadnt
friends on the inside-with a look at
curren-would have had to toe the line
and been asked to tell what they know
long ago

  youve already been told what i
know mickey said it wasnt much-
because i dont know much

  you know a good deal more than
youve said charged pash and im
warning you that youd better gei talk-
ing if you dont give what youve got
were going to take it from you

  well  suppose youll have to keep
doing it said mickey and ill be in-
terested in seeing how you work captain
ive often heard of the way you put the
pressure on but have never been able
quite to believe it

  curren smiled at this and pash be-
gan to glare through his lenses

  maybe he said it would be just
as well young woman if you didnt put
so much edge on your conversation itll
do you no good in the long run im
warning you he stood facing her
leaning upon the back of a chair first
of all he said id like some informa-
tion about the gun you used today
where you got it-what kind of a one
it was-and what you did with it

  ill answer the first of those captain
said mickey quietly and that answer
will do for the others also i had no
gun

  remember bawled pash im warn-
ing you ill stand for no nonsense

  i can see that said mickey and
thats the reason im telling you the
facts i dont like to see anybody get ex-
cited

  pash with an effort controlled him-
self all right he said if youve
made up your mind that we must squeeze
information out of you we cant help it
but if your feelings are hurt and you
feel yonve been talked to not so gently
why blame it on yourself

  i dont expect anything but the very
worst said mickey so lets be going
along but dont talk to me about guns
i had no gun when i went into the place
in middle city tower i saw no gun
while i was there i had none when
your police arrested me

  do you deny you own an automatic
  i do own one

  do you deny it is a shanley 

  it is a shanley 

  pash grinned at this now he said
were getting somewhere - zottman
he said to one of the two policemen let
me have that pistol

  the policeman took a small automatic
from a cloth bag he gave it to pash who
laid it upon a table

  take a glance at that he said to
mickey does it look like your pistol
it looks very much like it she ad-
mitted

  hah pash glanced at curren tri-
umphantly it seetns more and more as
though we were getting somewhere
he turned to the policeman lets have
the slugs he said

  from the cloth bag the man produced
two bullets both of them somewhat dis-
torted pash put them on the table be-
side the pistol

  these he said are the bullets that
were fired into the body of malitoff
they were removed at the autopsy
which was performed about two hours
ago since then-glowering at mickey
through his big lenses-they have been
put through the police laboratory as
has the weapon they were fired from
we have absolute proof that jhis gun
which you have acknowledged as yours
is that weapon

 yust a moment said curren but
i he was prevented from proceeding by
 pash who turned upon him with a
bitter look and an uplifted hand

  this said pash is my investiga-
tion and i must not be interfered with
very well said curren i merely
wished to set you straight

 i know what was in mr currens
mind said mickey to pash he
wanted to tell you that i didnt say this
pistol is mine and i didnt what i


mooneys in a jam

admitted captain was that it looks like
mine for there have been some thou-
sands of shanley s made and they all
look alike

  yeah said pash i know youre
smart but whether youve admitted
this weapon is yours or no makes no
difference the police laboratory tests
prove these bullets taken from malitoffs
body were fired from this pistol and
thats a first-class beginning you admit
you had a shanley 

  yes

  where did you get it

  the girl was silent

  all right well find out he glow-
ered at her through his lenses youve
said you hadnt that pistol with you at
any lime while you were in malitoffs
store if you hadnt it with you where
was it did you leave it at your apart-
ment

  she didnt answer he grinned at her
like an old dog i dont mind saying
we were there and didnt find it

  it wasnt there mickey said

  did you give it away at any time
did you sell it did you loan it to any-
one

  she made no reply

  for a few moments well put that
part of it aside and take up something
else you have a brother havent you
yes

  some time ago he was arrested tried
and convicted of various robberies hes
now serving a five-year term in the peni-
tentiary is that correct

   it is

  it was the testimony of this man who
has just been murdered-malitoff-that
convicted him am i right in that
mickey nodded did you or did you
not make threats against malitoff on the
day of and directly after the trial

  she didnt reply and pash said to one
of the policemen

  ask scharf to step in

  a wide-headed man with a bulging
stomach came into the room he tried to
seem at ease but was none too successful
is your name scharf asked pash
alonzo scharf said the heavy-stom-
ached man	
what was it you reported this after-
noon about this girl-indicating mickey

  i stood near her and another woman
one day in a corridor in city flail said
alonzo it was just after a trial mali-
toff had been a witness and as he went
by i heard this girl-pointing to mickey
-say to her companion that she was go-

ing to kill him-for testifying against her
brother

  thats all said pash and after
alonzo had gone out he turned to
mickey who was the woman you said
that to

   the girl was silent

  listen said pash youre trying to
cheat the lawl when i ask a question
i want an answer

  dont tell me youre judge and jury
and everything else protested mickey
because im not going to believe it
ive got enough stuff on you to indict
you a dozen times over said pash so
have sense and tell what happened fie
leaned toward her one finger pointing
what did mooney have to do with this
affair hes in it neither you nor him
can fool me hes in it and if youve
got any sense youll make a clean breast
of it

  just then there was a knock on the
door one of the policemen opened it
and someone spoke to him the man
an astonished look on his face ttimed
and said to pash

  heres mooney now

avell said captain pash as jerry
mooney walked into the room so
theyve brought you in have they
not to my knowledge said jerry
this little visit is all on my own he
waved a hand to curren hello steve
glad youre here then he went to
mickey how are you kid he said in
a low voice not feeling so bad eh
i feel all right she said and smiled
at him perhaps a little wanly ive
been hoping youd get back soon

   i tried a couple of times to phone you
but theyd not let me

  how do things look

   nice he said i think ill fix it in
the next few hours have they treated
you all right

  yes mr curren saw to that

  good boy steve said jerry hes
a first-rate guy

  in the meantime pash had gone out
into the corridor where a sergeant was
standing

  didnt someone bring this party in
asked pash


the blue book magazine

  not that i saw said the sergeant
when i first got a view of him he was
coming in the door all alone and he
asked for you

  pash locked his jaws and glared

  id have given quite a good bit he
said after a pause if some big cop had
dragged him in by the neck but you
can never get any satisfaction out of that
big beef no matter what its about

pash returned to the sheriffs room
    and his rasping voice filled it

  all right he said now youre here
mooney well see to it that youre tucked
away good and safe therell be no
more walking out and having us hunt all
over eastredge for you

  well said jerry cheerfully you
always were the one for hospitality no
matter how many words i have with you
you never fail in your offer of board and
lodging

  yes i know said pash and this
time mooney youre going to get it
something must have turned up since
i talked with you last jerry said good-
humoredly whos been playing games
with the facts and getting you all worked
up again

  look said pash and he pointed to
the automatic on the table does that
look like a joke

  a very competent little gun said
jerry looks like a nice one to carry
if a person needed such a thing

  that said pash is the weapon
malitoff was killed with jerry ap-
proached the table but the captain
waved him away keep your hands off
he said ill not have you touching any-
thing around here

  youre not thinking of fingerprints
said jerry and he looked at pash grin-
ning from what ive heard of this
piece captain it ought to have so many
on it that none of them would be of
much use to you

  what do you know about it asked
pash eying jerry like a hawk

  well you know when i get to pro-
ceeding around i ask questions and in
that way i often get to hear of things
the history of this little shooter-anyway
part of its history-shows that quite a
few people have handled it since the
killer heaved it out of the ninth-floor
window of the middle city tower
jerry put his hands in his pockets and
looked thoughtfully at pash now lets
see he said first there was this fellah
gravy in the short order cafe he got

it out of the street-cleaners truck then
he sold it to a cab-driver the cab-
driver passed it on to a secondhand
dealer thats where you got it three

jeople when it comes to handling said
erry and finger-marking can give a
gun apretty good work-out

  weve got more than fingerprints
said pash we know this girl owned
a  automatic shanley also we know
that she threatened to kill malitoff she
was in a room next his just before he was
shot she was found standing beside his
dead body immediately after the shots
were fired

  but jerry gave little attention to this
he kept his gaze upon the pistol lying on
the table

  and this is the gun the shooting was
done with is it i suppose youve looked
at the number of it and everything
it has no number said pash peo-
ple who do jobs like this always cut the
number out they think thatll get them
something they forget he said with
huge satisfaction that the laboratory
gives us facts that are sufficient proof in
themselves

  you seem to have gone after all the
points in this case dont you said
jerry his brows uplifted laboratory
and everything i call that being pretty
thorough what did the firearms permits
show you when you looked over the list
of them

  revolvers or pistols with the num-
bers cut out cant be traced on the
permit-list said pash and people
who make up their minds to do a piece
of knock-off work like this never bother
about permits they get their guns from
somebody who handles them under
cover

  if youd taken a little trouble said
jerry and opened the permit file youd
have learned something jerry looked
at mickey you did have an automatic
 didnt you she nodded where
did you buy it

  at leopolds

  did he send in your name for a per-
mit

  he told me he did

  do you know the number of the
pistol you bought

  no she said i never looked

jerry took a handkerchief-covered ob-
ject from his pocket lie opened it up-
on the table

  here is the automatic she bought he
said to curren the number is x b

mooneys in a jam

 -take a look at it captain and
then go to your pistol-permit file and
look it up also put it through the
laboratory if you want and see what
more you can find

	pash gazed at jerry stormily

  the first thing  want done about
this he said beating the table with his
fist is to hear you tell where this pistol
came from

   all you need worry about said jerry
is whether its the piece i say it is the
filell tell you that

  youve had this and have withheld
it yelled pash thats an old trick of
yours mooney and you know as well
as i do its illegal to conceal evidence
from the police

  havent i brought it in said jerry
he turned to curren when i bring
a thing in openly and offer it as evidence
could you call- that concealment-in
court

   it might be called that said curren
but it couldnt be made to hold

ell anyway said pash its
plain to me youve been up to
something and whatever it is its going
to stop right here he turned to ihe
policeman zottman he said take
charge of this man have him booked for
complicity in the malitoff murder and
see hes put in a cell

  listen said jerry amiably lets
take it a little more quietly you say
captain ive been up to something and
thats right  have been ive been try-
ing to open up this killing

   pash snorted derisively
f- we dont need any help he said
we know who did the killing

 yeah said jerry you always know
and when its looked over its mostly
found to be a lot of stuff you want to
believe because of something that hasnt
got anything to do with the case this
time and its happened before you want
it to turn out so and so because youre
sore on me

  slam him into a cell zottman said
pash to the policeman and dont be
too easy about it

  all right said jerry jusfs you
please but understand me pash if you
sling me in the can youre going to get
one hell of a blasting in the newspapers
for it if im in a cell this whole thing
will break tomorrow morning in a way
youre not thinking of and most of the
piecesll fall on your thick nut let me
keep on the case as ive been going and

itll break in a couple of hours and
youll get the credit

  all talk said pash but with a sud-
den sharp look in his eyes what have
you got lets hear ill

  im telling you something said jer-
ry but im going into no details you
people always ily to bits when you try
to work with them what you did
jerry proceeded was to stop thinking as
soon as youd found id been hooked
and right away when they told you
that theyd also put ihe hand on my sec-
retary you let yourself be riveted down
hard

  why shouldnt i said pash no
one goes hunting for a thing after hes
found it those two arrests were enough
for me

  yeah i know and thats what im
talking about no good copd let him-
self dry up that way as soon as he got
his breath hed looked around hed
found that malitoff was a crook that he
had a record as long as your arm be-
sides that hed have found there were
crooks employed in malitoffs whod
done their bits hed have found all was
not well in the control of the place and
that the boys did not like each other any
too well-and hed know almost anything
could come out of a set-up like that
we know about malitoff and his
diamond-smuggling said pash and we
know about sudler and we know
enough not to be pulled to one side by
anybodys phony talk

  o k said jerry im through
thats my last go ahead and make a
jackass of yourself with a little co-
operation i could clear this thing up in
the njext couple of hours

  any showing how smart you are
said pash will be done in a cell you
can have a nice comfortable seat he
said with a grin and maybe you could
dictate to somebody who has a pad of
paper and a pencil just what youd want
them to do

  personally said curren to pash i
dont see what purpose itll serve to put
mooney under arrest just now if hes at
large itll do no damage its quite evi-
dent he doesnt mean to run away his
coming here on his own shows that im
in favor of giving him room to work in
my opinion is that hell bring in some-
thing thatll put a new face on the
whole matter

  pash burst into a long and strenuous
objection to this and curren finally said
impatiently
the blue book magazine

  all right but judge anderson is still
in the building and ill speak to him
again you know captain he has never
looked on police methods favorably and
i feel pretty sure hell disagree with you
in this and let mooney run

  pash blazed up but jerry disregard-
ing the mans remarks began to talk
through them

  heres a job to do he said ill
make you an offer ill not only do this
case up in a neat bundle as i just said
but ill lay it in your lap and you can
open it and show it to all the morning-
paper boys as your own

  i dont have to depend on you or
anyone else for my write-ups said pash
im known my records written down
for over thirty years i dont have to
take anything from anyone else but i
dont want anderson lecturing me i
can only take a lit tie more from him
without blowing up and remember
at seven oclock be all ready with what-
ever youve got to show for thats the
time the bells going to ring on you and
im going to give my story to the papers
jerry grinned

  tough guy to the last he said he
turned to curren o k steve ill
remember this and then to mickey
keep your chin up ill be back before
long and youll be out of this he was
turning away and then paused what
say to the algerian moon after you have
a chance to get home and dress

  mickeys beautiful teeth showed in a
smile as she looked at him

  we were there last night she said
remember this time lets go to the
lombardy

  theres no dancing there you know
said jerry

  she nodded

  this is one time ill not want to
dance she said ill want to talk a
little about things

  o k said jerry well do that

when jerry reached his office he
fovind ates surrounded by editions
of the evening papers the boy arose
hastily

  listen he said you hadnt ought
tove come herd the police have been

around almost all the time since you
went away and maybe theyre watching
some place now

  its all right said jerry theyve
laid off me-for a while anyone else
been here

  reporters said ates a lot of
them there were a good many phone
calls i put them down

  he handed jerry a list

  ive been hearing from them while i
was out said jerry as he glanced at the
slip but try to get chubby for me
now

  in a few moments chubby answered
and jerry said

  what have you found out

  ive got a little bagful said chubby
want to hear it now

  no im going home to get a bath
and some clean clothes run up there
then we can talk

  jerry at his apartment had a warm
bath with plenty of soap and rubbing
he had slipped into his pajamas and a
house-robe and had lighted a cigarette
when his doorbell rang and he admitted
chubby

  im getting to be a big help to you
said chubby as he sat down when
things begin to break you never know
how far theyll go

  something about sonya said jerry
yes but besides that i picked up a
nice little item when i went to see the
mending-shop girl with the money i
was lucky when i went in for there was
no one in the place but herself when
i asked her was she miss codrey she
said she was and then i said id come
for a few words with her on business-
about the picture shed sold to malitoff
and right away said chubby she
started to get a little shaky she said
shed thought maybe something would
happen and shed get part of the money
malitoff has sold the thing for even a
little of it and now that he was dead
she supposed she wouldnt

  i had to talk to her awful easy said
chubby because i saw if i didnt i
couldnt get the money over to her with-
out her thinking something was wrong
i knew if she ever got it into her head
that the murder was in any way hooked
up with it shed never take it but i
stepped along nice and quiet chubby
said and made her believe the thing
had been fixed up yesterday that people
who didnt like the way the thing had
been done had put the squeeze on mali-
toff and made him give
mooneys in a jam

   you told her not to talk said jerry
 yeah i said malitoffs going out
 might make trouble in things that came
 just about the same time his heirs might
 ask for explanations she said shed say
 nothing not even to her mother but
 there was one person-she thought hed
 be sure to ask questions thats the
 party who collects malitoffs rents i
 asked her about him and what i got i
 thought was kind of funny he took
 out a little loose-leaf memoranda book
 tore out a page and handed it to jerry
 take a look

  erry read what was on the page and
  then tucked it in his pocket

  i heard about that awhile ago he
said and ive been thinking of drap-
ing in on him just to see what might
e going on

   after i left themoney with the girl
 said chubby i sent the rest of it just
 like you said then i went over to the
 etruria and talked with the people there
 tweedy got me a chance to listen to the
 telephone-girl freda and does she like
 this sonya-or does she

  when i once got her started on the
subject i had trouble keeping her in
control but when i got her down to it
she gave me the facts shed talked to
klem that one said chubby i
fixed at just about the time you called
me awhile ago klem said you had been
reported as coming out of headquarters
and his idea was that youd gone there
to turn in what youd taken at her apart-
ment and to try and fix yourself right
with pash and that you must have done
it or you wouldnt be coming out as you
did

  well anyhow the boys got a head
to think with grinned jerry what
else did he say

  he told her you doing like you done
made him sure he had something to set-
tle with her and that he was going to
do it soon right away when hed

 	stopped talking said chubby she puts
 in a call for sudler and it seems what
 she wanted from him was protection
 she wanted him to come to the etruria
 and to come soon for almost any minute
 klem might get there and she was afraid
 of him

   jerry looked up abruptly

  and of course sudler being a real
tough boy said hed be there

  -ie said he would said chubby
but not right away he had some busi-
ness about eight oclock uptown and

where do you think it is hes going
a-calling

  id never know said jerry where
its that address i wrote on the paper
i gave you a couple of minutes ago
jerry sat apparently turning this over
in his mind and then he said

  sudlers going up there too is he
that might make it kind of nice if he
drops in while im there maybe hell be
interested in what im going to say
after chubby had gone jerry slept for
a while then he rose dressed and
called headquarters

  captain pash he said

  but the captain had gone home jer-
ry got his number and in a few moments
the captains querulous voice was rasp-
ing over the wire

  in fifteen minutes said jerry a cab
will stop in front of your door ill be
in it and on my way to visit the party
who shot malitoff if you are ready and
waiting and want to go along thatll be
your chance

  he put down the telephone while the
captain was still yelling and demanding
he then called a cab and smoked a ciga-
rette until he had word it was at the door

in less than the fifteen minutes named
he drove up to the home of captain
pash the man was standing at the gate
bundled in a big coat his hat pulled
down on his head

  before you say a word said pash
at the cab window let me tell you im
not going to be jockeyed around by you
or anybody else and furthermore-
all right captain grinned jerry
get in well not have any talk this
time were going to do things so lets
be on our way

  pash got into the cab where are we
going he asked as he adjusted himself
and the taxi crept away from the curb
what name asked pash

  why bother with names said jerry
but i hope captain youve put a gun
in your pocket

  dont worry about me said pash
ive been in the police business too long
to overlook a thing like that

  presently jerry called to the cabman to
stop and he and pash got out

  drive around the next corner said
jerry to the cabman and wait about a
block farther on

  the cab drew away and then disap-
peared

  pash was looking about glumly
  which way he said
the blue book magazine

  straight ahead replied jerry the
number is  they moved on until
the number showed in the fanlight over
the door of ah apartment house on the
opposite side of the street all right
said jerry im not sure just how the
thing stands at the moment so lets set-
tle down here for a little and see if any-
thinghappens

  they had waited about a quarter of an
hour when they heard a cab it stopped
before the door across the street and a
man got out	

  sudler whispered pash turning his
look upon jerry the doorman at
malitoffs

  none other said jerry i wasnt
sure if hed gone in or not thats why
the wait

  sudler paid the cabman and entered
the building

  now said pash whats next

  in a few moments well also go in
said jerry it was perhaps ten minutes
before he stirred and pash waited pa-
tiently thatll be enough said jer-
ry i always like to let diem get well
into their business before i move in on
them

  the elevator was shown to be at the
basement level jerry who had looked at
the list of names at one side said

  lets take the stairs the party we
want is on the third floor

  pash said nothing but followed him
up the flight to the second floor at the
third floor jerry paused

  we want  he said ill do the
talking and you keep your eyes on the
party thats re-

  the sentence was broken by the rend-
ing report of a heavy revolver before
the shock of the sound had settled the
two men were rushing down the hall
the door of  opened and sudler a
revolver in his hand appeared instant-
ly pash with the true police instinct
struck him with a blackjack hed drawn
while on the way and as sudler col-
lapsed jerry entered the room prawn
head clerk at malitoffs was sitting in a
hair his hands pressed against his mid-
dle jerry bent over him

  did he shoot you jerry asked
sudler did gasped prawn he said
hed do it and he has

sudler fallen in the doorway part-
ly lifted himself he grinned at prawn
through a mask of blood

  you dirty double-crosser he said
you always wanted the best of things

didnt you i told you nobody could
make a sucker out of me

  hes wrong gasped prawn i nev-
er got anything but wages from malitoff
and not much of that

  sudler got to his feet with the help of
pash the house was in an uproar by
this time and tenants of the apartment
filled the hall the excited elevator-man
was demanding to know what had hap-
pened

  keep your voice down said pash
and telephone for the police tell them
a man has been shot

  he shoved sudlers gun into his coat
pocket shoved the man into a chair and
shut the room door prawn was sunken
deep now in his chair his head hanging
and he was moaning

  that guy said sudler will die with
a slug in him and hell go on lying it
was him that shot malitoff and it was
him that got away with the ruby this
mug - indicating jerry - was arrested
for stealing malitoff found it out and
was shot to keep him quiet

  prawn shot malitoff said pash
and is that what you shot prawn for

wiping the blood from his face
sudler grinned

  not me he said anybody could
have taken a wham at malitoff and it
would have been all right with me
what i wanted was a piece of the ice
prawn wouldnt do anything so i fixed
him-as i said i would

  a knock sounded on the door

  i called the police theyre coming
said the voice of the elevator-operator

  all right said pash keep that
hallway clear

  jerry spoke to prawn

  did you shoot malitoff he asked
yes said the man with a gasping
effort but not because of the ruby i
dont know what became of that i
thought you took it or maybe malitoff
himself for the insurance

  dont forget said pash youre mak-
ing a statement to the police

  i know-i am said the man

  pash opened the door and called in the
elevator-man

  listen to this he said ill want
your testimony as a witness to this state-
ment and then to prawn you admit
you shot malitoff

  yes yes-i shot him-twice

  what did you do it for

  he never gave me more than wages
i-i turned over things to him that he
mooneys in a jam

made big money out of i never got any-
thing he made six thousand dollars
out of a picture-the other day i located
that for him just like ive done-lots of
things but i didnt get a cent thats
-thats why i made up my mind to kill
him

  what did you do with the gun
asked jerry

  i-t threw it out of the window
  was it your gun asked pash

  it was in his office i got the idea
when i saw it

  how did you get it asked pash
how did you get into ihe room and
out so quickly

  but the man could not answer his
head sank still lower and his whole body
seemed to fold up in the chair

  has he passed out asked sudler
no said pash but he will and
youll cook for it

  it was self-defense grinned sudler
the guy was a killer you just heard
him admit it i came in to talk about
this business i just mentioned and he
tried to get me

  a few minutes later the police arrived
prawn was carried out and sudler was
taken in charge by a pair of stalwart
patrolmen for a moment jerry stood
alone in the room with pash

  well said jerry there it is all
done up in a neat package as i said
and laid in your lap

  pashs lean jaw worked his hawklike
beak pointed at mooney

  it lets the girl out he said and
as far as i can see its going to let you
out but listen fellah in spite of that
youre not fooling me any youve been
in this thing how i dont know but
youve been in it and only your usual
luck got you out so ill be watching
you dont forget that

there were violins at the lombardy
also there were clarinets a cello and
a wonderful piano but no dancing sil-
vestro had always thought his music was
enough

  mickey sat with mooney at one of the
tables

  well not stay very long she said
maybe an hour i took an awfufpound-
ing today and i need sleep

  yeah said jerry youll want a
night and a day of that to catch up
if it hadnt been for that pistol said
mickey and the way i lost control of
myself that day at the courthouse i think
things wouldnt have been so bad for



 id got over that idea of being a law of
 my own a long time ago i brought the
 pistol to the office with me today to get
 it out of my rooms when i went to
 noras place i took it with me thinking
 id turn it over to her but when the
 time came i couldnt i was ashamed
 of the ihreats id made i said nothing
 to her but hid the pistol in her desk
 meaning to tell her about it at another
 time

    theres one thing i havent been able
 to understand said jerry and thats
 why you asked to see malitoff personal-
 ly when you were in his place

   that was another thing i had in my
 mind said mickey i w-antecl to see
 him to speak to him and then go away
 i wanted to prove to myself that i never
 would think as i had been thinking
 again

    i saw in the pistol in the office said
  jerry ates saw it and your having it
  made the whole thing look pretty bad
  it knocked me further than id care to
  say and i hadnt an idea about what had
  really happened

 f ou seemed as if you knew what you
 i were going to do when you left
 pashs office said mickey telling me
 not to be scared-and everything

    all a bluff said jerry i hadnt an
 idea and i didnt have one until i
 talked with georgie and he told me that
 sudler the doorman at malitoffs had
 been a strong-arm man for eddie klem
 and then when mrs doxey told me
 klem had a piece of malitoffs business
 i thought there might be something
 when i talked to klem i could see there
 xvas something there was a kind of glim-
 mer but i didnt know what

   but ill bet you let on you knew a
 lot said mickey

    jerry grinned at her

   you have to do it he said let
 them once see youre stuck and its aw-
 fully hard to do anything afterward but
 when i talked to cora at the hospital
 and she told me what the woman looked
 like that had called at her place and
 slugged her and when chubby said the
 description was like sonya a friend of
 klems i really began to take hold of
 things

   when i heard sonya was broke and
 had been trying to raise money and that
 shed had a fight with klem because he
 wouldnt put any through i began to
 figure on a possibility klem didnt
 know who had the rubyl sonya was
 
the blue book magazine

working with sudler and klem was be-
ing kidded that idea was what made
me talk plain as ive told you in sonyas
apartment and begin to rummage
around and at last to walk out with the
ruby klem wasnt sure of anything and
sonya wouldnt give herself away while
he was around listening

  i went to see sudler to find out about
the tie-up with sonya-if any he had
seen cora in malitoffs place and knew
her he mentioned her to sonya and
sonya saying nothing stepped around to
coras and played a few cards that sud-
ler knew nothing about

hat dame said mickey she
was working with sudler against
klem and by herself against sudler
yeah said jerry and it looks as
if she didnt hesitate any either and
when sudler got sore when he heard
what shed done he dropped the hint
that klem had been at malitoffs around
noon and afterwards tried to cover up
sudler didnt seem to have anything
against klem personal because he also
tried to cover him by tearing the piece
out of the clock record on malitoffs
door

  why did he do that said mickey
i dont see any reason for it

  jerry shook his head doubtfully

  it must be about the gun he took out
of klems pocket plutstine didnt know
what became of that but prawn says the
gun was on a shelf in malitoffs room

he saw it there and got thinking about
it then he used it so i think sudler
gave the gun to malitoff after klem went
away

  i figure it out said jerry that when
klem heard about the shooting and
found the gun had been taken from his
pocket lie got nervous if it was found
by the police they might trace it to son-
ya and to save herself shed tell how
hed taken it from her so he must have
begun a hunt for it just about the lime
we did

  it was plutstine who first told me
of how prawn felt about the shabby deal
malitoff was giving him and how sore
he was about it also he told me how
he from another part of the store saw
prawn coming out of his room after
everybody else had rushed into the room
where the body was found and when
you remember there was a communicat-
ing door between the two rooms you can
see how prawn managed the job

  and to think said mickey that i
sat in that right-hand room while he
came into the other one with that terri-
ble thought in his mind

ell youre in the clear kid said
jerry and maybe itd be best if
you got your mind off it they listened
to the swelling of the violins the soft
blowing of the clarinets and the deep
background made by the piano

  nice eh jerry commented

  beautiful said mickey

heal experiences

ombs

the pilot of a medium bomber tells a flame-vivid story of his part

in a recent british raid on the invasion bases

as told to-

ralph mighaelis

the squadron leader said youre
for antwerp tonight boys and we
knew it was an invasion-ports show

  then the intelligence officer gave us
our instructions and pointed out our ob-
jectives on the target map he told us
where to expect anti-aircraft fire and
where we would meet the most intense
searchlight concentrations we were to
bomb the docks barge concentrations
and shipping the whole show had been
worked out meticulously by the staff be-
fore we started on it

  each captain of the planes comprising
the bombing force was given his zero
hour at which he was to attack his target
he was given the direction from which
he should approach it and the direction
by which he should leave it together
with the minimum height below which
he must not fly over the target and the
time allowed him to find his target and
carry out his bombing   



  it was bright moonlight as we roared
across the airdrome with a useful bomb
load to dump on the invasion fleet

  my wireless operator was busy check-
ing his instrument with a message to the
ground station while my bomb-aimer
was giving the once-over to his gadgets
and the front guns which are also his job

  the country below was almost as clear
as daylight as it rolled beneath us like a
patchwork quilt bathed in a silver light
over the coast lighthouses flashed and
shot out their beams while our own
searchlights stabbed about the sky on
the lookout for german raiders

  as we approached the belgian coast
searchlights reached up their long silver
fingers at us and the barking woof-woof
of bursting anti-aircraft shells under our
port wing announced that german gun-
ners had spotted us

  were comparatively little chaps-me-
dium bombers they call us and we fly
real experiences

a good deal lower than the big fellows
consequently we get a lot of stuff fired
at us that cant reach the height at which
the big fellows fly in fact they seem to
loose off everything at us except hand-
grenades

  as we approached the target we could
see that somebody probably the big fel-
lows had been there before us for there
was a regular bonfire blazing among the
dock warehouses every now and then
there was an explosion which sent out
another gush of flames the searchlights
caught us in their blinding concentrated
glare and we became the center of a real
brocks benefit strings of red and
green tracer bullets came sizzling up
toward us there were flaming onions
strung together in clumps of threes with
pom-pom and anti-aircraft shells galore

  the plane began to rock crazily from
the bursts of anti-aircraft shells and i
changed height and direction quickly to
put the gunners off their aim i shook
them off for a bit but they picked us up
again as we flew over the target

down below in the light from the
blazing warehouses i could see a
lunch of barges waiting to go through the
ock into the dock basin inside the ma-
chine i could just see the legs of my
bomb-aimer as he lay full length face
downward peering through his window
under the nose of the machine

  left - right    left - steady 
came his voice over my telephone as he
directed my steering over the target
then he told me we had overrun it and
asked me to fly over again

  i dodged round for a few minutes to
get away from the searchlights and the
gun-fire and then ran over the target
again

  left    left    right  directed
my bomb-aimer but just then there
was a terrific report behind me as a shell
burst and the nose of the machine
pitched downward as if a giant foot had
given us a tremendous kick from behind

  i regained control with some difficulty
and the rear gunner reported that he
could see holes in the tail-plane how-
ever as the plane still answered to con-
trols i flew once more across the target

  left-left    steady chanted
the bomb-aimer then bombs off

  i threw the plane over in a quick dodg-
ing turn as soon as i heard bombs off
for i knew that the bomb-aimer had done
his job and it was not healthy to stay in
that neighborhood any longer

  i was too busy dodging searchlights
and anti-aircraft fire for the next few
minutes to be able to look back and see
what damage we had done but the
bomb-aimer and rear gunner reported
that there had been a tremendous explo-
sion among the barges and that they had
seen what appeared to be a chunk of one
of the lock-gates pitched clean over the
wharf into a neighboring dock basin

  the searchlights picked us up again
and a shell bursting at close quarters
above our starboard wing fairly stripped
the fabric off it what with this and the
hole in the tail-plane we began to lose a
bit of height and as i was reluctant to
strain the injured machine by throwing
it about to dodge anti-aircraft fire we
collected all that was coming to us

  my rear gunner spotted a flaming-
onion battery that was making itself par-
ticularly objectionable and begged to be
allowed to have a shot at him i let him
have his shooting and he silenced the
battery for we did not hear from it again

  as we flew home across the north sea
the clouds were gathering and i told my
wireless operator to ask our home station
for a fix that is to say he would send
out our code number to the home station 
and they using a system of wireless de-
tection which need not be explained here
would work out our position on a map

  a few minutes later back came the re-
ply from our home station giving our
position and i set our course for home

  there was a bit of ground-mist as we
approached our airdrome we could see
through it quite clearly until we got down
to about one thousand feet and then it
got thicker and i could see that it was
not going to be an easy landing i told
my wireless operator to ask the airdrome
for permission to land and as soon as
they gave it they put a flare-path out

the lower we got the more confused
the flare-path appeared in the ground
mist as t wound my flaps down and
flew in to land they looked as if they
were shining from the bottom of a pool
and i had to guess our height above the
ground for it was impossible to see it
through the thick ground-mist

  however we touched down nicely and
taxied away to our parking-place

  the tender rumbled out to meet us
and we drove back to the office to report
our nights work to the intelligence offi-
cer and to our commanding officer who
always waits up for us to come home
heaven knows when that man sleeps


jbalkan

 an american citizen tells of his boyhood in that wild moun-
 tain land where the greeks and italians are fighting today

    by stoyan christowe

 itself was a low building shaped like a
 horseshoe with a well in the center of the
 yard in front of it we dismounted in the
 yard tethered our horses to posts near
 the well and hung bags of oats at their
 noses then we walked over to the ter-
 race and sat at a table the eave of the
 inn extended several feet from the wall
 forming a kind of awning beneath which
 were tables at which travelers could sit
 in the shade and enjoy a view of the
 plain

 the innkeeper whom my father knew
 well from his previous journeys came
 over and greeted my father then he
 asked if the young comitadji meaning
 me was his son a comitadji was an
 armed member of the secret revolutionary
 bands that were fighting the turks
 they were inspired patriots and were re-
 garded as heroes so i liked the inn-
 keeper even if it was in fun that he re-
 ferred to me as a comitadji every boy
 whose father was a comatadji was proud
 and i often felt ashamed that my father
 wasnt one

 besides ourselves there were two other
 guests at the inn they were albanian
 mohammedans of the gheg tribe they
 wore white fezzes without tassels and
 extravagantly embroidered white woolen
 trousers tight around the calves and



for a long time i had been coaxing
my father to take me on one of his
regular trips to prilep the distant
town where he went to buy oxen to sell
to the peasants of our valley finally
when i was about twelve he did take
me it was the first time i had ever been
away from the village for more than a
jay

  we traveled on foot across the moun-
tains until we reached the city of monas-
tic there we hired two horses for our
journey across the plain to prilep they
were two fine mounts black as coal
my father promised their owner we
would take good care of them it was
a whole days ride from monastir to pri-
lep and we started out early in the
morning to reach our destination before
nightfall these were turkish times
and one never traveled at night especial-
ly if one carried money

  astride the black mounts we rode
across the plain passing many -villages
my father told me the names of these
villages and though years have passed
since then and i have traveled half
around the earth i still remember their
names-orizari berantzi topoltchani
ushi the last place was no village at
all but just an inn standing like a little
fort atop a hump in the plain the inn
real experiences

knees and baggy toward the hips their
skanderbeg jackets of wool dyed black
were sleeveless and buttonless with loose
yarn of the same color hanging at the
back like mops they were not soldiers
yet they were dressed alike in their tribal
costumes and were girdled with rows of
cartridges

  when my father and i had dismounted
the ghegs observed us for an instant and
continued to be occupied with their meal
and now as we sat at the other end of
the veranda from them they conversed
in low tones my father spoke albanian
and could have understood what they
were saying but by the time their words
reached our table the sound died away

  the innkeeper brought us food and
a jug of wine for my father i watched
the ghegs and once or twice i caught
them glancing at our horses i did not
like that but my father did not seem
disquieted only once i noticed him
look sidewise at the ghegs and that
reminded me of the way i looked at dogs
that did not bark

  presently the ghegs knocked on the
table for the innkeeper paying for what
they had eaten they picked up their
rifles which had been propped up against
the wall within reach as they sat took
their beaded skin-bags from the ground
and walked over to where our horses
were tethered just like that in the
most casual way they took down our
bags and hung theirs on the saddles they
did this without saying a word calmly
indifferently

i broke out in sweat not for the
horses but from fear that the ghegs
might search us my father and i carried
one hundred and twenty gold pounds on
our persons forty pieces wrapped in
cloth dipped in beeswax and shaped like
an amulet i carried in my bosom next
my bare skin the rest divided in two
piles were sewn in the lining of my
fathers coat besides even though i had
no definite knowledge of it i was certain
my father was carrying secret corre-
spondence to the revolutionary committee
at prilep

  my father rose from the table and
quite casually like the ghegs walked
over to where they were took down their
bags and slung ours back upon the sad-
dles my heart began to flutter like an
agitated bird in a cage how could any-
one do such a thing with ghegs they
were the most desperate people from
durazzo to istanbul they were a ter-

ror from the danube to the egean de-
scendants of albanian christians who
years ago had embraced islam they were
powerful and privileged at the expense
of their christian brothers who had clung
to llie faith turks real turks had
feelings touched by supplication or the
sight of suffering turks sometimes gave
way to their human sympathies but
ghegs were ruthless were as unaffected
by entreaty as stones no fiercer people
could be imagined than a horde of gheg
bashibazouks

  the two ghegs watched my father re-
move their bags as a two-headed giant
might look at a child playing with some-
thing which it cannot harm and of which
he alone is master they waited until my
father replaced our own bags on the sad-
dles and then they broke into loud laugh-
ter not even bothering to take down our
own bags they put theirs back on un-
tethered the horses flung themselves in-
to the saddles and galloped toward mon-
astir

we continued toward prilep on foot
now and then the road skirted
an elevation that rose like a camels hump
athwart the plain and then again there
was another interminable stretch before
us when we had rounded the last one
of these mounds we saw the peaks of
mount babuna at the farthest end of the
plain prilep was where the mountain
met the plain

  we cannot reach prilep by night
said my father well have to sleep in
allentzi he explained that allentzi
was a village not very far from where
we were on the road and that he had a
friend there whose name was strahil and
who was chief of the local revolutionary
committee

  allentzi was not on the road but a
mile away from it nestling in a hollow
between two oblong mounds that ex-
tended toward the road and embraced
a semicirde of meadows dotted with
heaps of recently mown hay a path
issued from the village and ran like a
ribbon through the meadows joining the
main road at a point where a fountain
spurted water into an old mossy stone
trough not far from the spring a lone
peasant was swinging a scythe against a
narrow patch of tall grass a mare and
her colt grazed near by

  good evening said my father as we
approached the mower

  god be good to you the man re-
plied and continued to brandish his im-


balkan

plement against the grass twilight was
falling over the plain and the man was
anxious to finish his mowing before go-
ing home we lingered keeping close to
the man and out of the way of his scythe
my father asked some questions to which
the man replied without turning his
eyes from the curved line which the
scythe followed as it ate away the flow-
ery grass when my father asked about
his friend strahil the man stopped and
looked at us for the first time

  strahil is no longer here said the
man he was an old man but powerfully
built and well preserved with mustaches
curving like sickles

  but his brother tsvetan is here
observed my father we can stay with
him

  tsvetan is not here either theres
no one here of strahifs they all moved
to another village

  i wonder then where we shall sleep
put in my father expecting the man to
suggest the hospitality of his own house
at this the peasant pulled a tongue-
shaped whetstone from the folds of his
leather belt and began to lick the blade
with it

  you can sleep out here in the mead-
ows he said coldly again he bent down
to his task the instrument sharpened
sang as it cut the crisp grass serpent-
like the scythe swung before my eyes
and hissed and whined amidst the grass
which seemed to sigh as it fell in swaths
at the mowers feet

over the plain twilight was deepen-
ing the peaks of mount babuna
were shrouded in dusk i felt terribly
lonely and homesick and i began to
wish i hadnt begged my father to take
me along on his trip to prilep i yearned
to be back home under the shelter of our
own roof try as i would i could not
hide the way t felt

my father did not get angry he spoke
very gently to me dont cry he said

  where will we sleep i asked as
soon as i was able to speak without chok-
ing

  dont you be worrying about that
he tried to reassure me a father takes
care of that

  by this time the man had finished the
strip he tied a sheaf of grass to either
side of the pack-saddle mounted the
mare and placed his scythe across his lap
like a rifle the colt jumped a few times
gave a strident neigh and scampered after
its mother

bandits	i

   my father nodded to me to follow the
 man knew we were walking right behind
 him but did not turn back to look at us
 he was riding slowly not to tire the
 colt and we could keep up with him
 without difficulty

    at last after we crossed a little brook
 that sang softly in the dusk we entered
 the village we kept close to the man
 not to lose him he rode into a broad
 court in the center of which stood a
 threshing-post at the far side of the
 court a one-story house pressed down up-
 on the earth like a crouched animal it
 had one large door and a row of small
 windows on either side of the door it
 looked like a barrack	

 the man dismounted and handed the
 halter-cord to a woman who came out
 from the house a large dog wagging
 his tail cowered at the feet of his master
 it did not bark at us some children ran
 out of the doorway and shouted happy
 that their grandfather had returned from
 the meadows

   my father and i stood by silently
 when the old man with one infant
 pressed to his bosom and another cling-
 ing to him hobbled toward the door we
 trotted after him the man entered the
 house of which he was the master my
 father and i strangers to it also entered
 it no one asked us in and no one wel-
 comed us still as soon as we crossed
 the threshold we said good evening
 again no one acknowledged the good-will
 which we brought in except perhaps the
 fireside toward which we proceeded in-
 stinctively uninvited we sat on one
 side of the hearth and the old man sat
 opposite us the room was immense and
 the family a large one there were at
 least a dozen other people in the great in-
 terior men women children some of
 the children held to their mothers aprons
 being in the way as the women went
 about attending to their household work

   the old man never once raised his
 eyes to look at us none of us spoke
 meantime the women set the supper
 table and youngsters and adults began to
 line themselves up along the board as at
 free table in a monastery the old man
 rose and took his place at the head of the
 table throughout the evening i felt con-
 strained but now when all the family
 had seated themselves at the table and
 my father and i invited by none to share
 in the meal still sat by the hearth si-
 lently like two punished children i
 feared the timbers from the roof would
real ex

crash upon me and not because no one
asked us to supper but because i feared
my father would make us sit at the table
uninvited

 fortunately one of the women-she
had large black sunken eyes that be-
spoke much suffering-came over and
spread a cheesecloth on the hearthstone
before us she put half a loaf of corn-
bread on the cloth brought a large earth-
en bowl filled with buttermilk and rested
two wooden spoons against its brim

 when supper was over the women
cleared the table and swept the crumbs
soon after the youngsters were put to
bed with their stockings and outer gar-
ments on they lay down on the bedding
in the very places where they had eaten
supper huddling close to one another like
sheep their heads to the walls and their
limbs stretched out toward the middle
of the floor the women brought quilts
and threw them over the sprawled com-
pany

  the old man returned to his patriarchal
place near the fire still not looking at us
or saying a word to us i had a feeling
of guilt for our having inflicted our pres-
ence upon the household but i was so
weary and fatigued from the journey
that i could hardly keep my eyes open
i was glad when the old man stretched
himself out and covered himself with a
coarse woolen blanket the others too
began to retire in their various places
through the spacious interior the wom-
an who had thought of us at supper
fetched us a blanket and my father and
i laid our tired heads on the rough floor
wrapped the blanket about us and went
to sleep

it was earlier than i had risen for a long
time my father had probably been
pushing at me to rouse me i rubbed my
eyes and woke up to the fact that we
were not at home the experiences of
yesterday began to flood my mind and
for a few seconds i was uncertain wheth-
er they were real or whether it was some-
thing i had dreamed

  the whole household was astir men
and women fastened pigskin sandals on
their feet took turns at pouring water
to wash their faces and were off yoking
oxen fitting pack-saddles to horses and
donkeys and starting out to field and
meadow no breakfast was necessary
for them in bags and baskets they car-
ried their food for the day with them

  in the place which he had occupied dur-
ing the evening and in which he had

slept sat our reluctant host a little
copper pot shaped like an hourglass and
with a long handle was stuck in the
sparkling ashes the old man was brew-
ing his morning turkish coffee when
the brew was ready he poured it out in
two small porcelain cups taking care to
distribute evenly tle layer of brown
cream that had floated at the top of the
pot he offered the first cup to my
father and took the second for himself
but again he said not a word

as soon as my father had finished his
 coffee we rose to go my father shook
our silent hosts hand which was grudg-
ingly given i had been taught by my
mother to kiss rather than to shake the
hands of old people so i bowed before
the old man and kissed his hand then
just as we started i turned back and
asked the man his name

  oh what do you want my name for
he grumbled

  id like to have if grandfather some
day we hope to repay you for your good-
ness there was no irony in what i
said i really felt guilty that my father
had so brazenly inflicted our guesthood
on the man and was grateful for his
patience with us

  not wishing to quench my boyish en-
thusiasm or perhaps irritated by my
importunity the man said well its
bogdan golavoda

 when we were out of the house i
wrote in my notebook bogdan golavo-
da village allentzi district of prilep

  we retraced our way over the path
through the meadows and joined the main
road the sun now beamed from behind
the peaks of babuna gilding the whole
plain the dew upon the grass and
wheat-stalks glistened like quicksilver
peasants trudged to their patches of field
or meadow where they would spend the
day in labor and sweat

  we walked along upon the dusty road
quite oblivious of the extraordinary in-
cidents of our journey prilep was be-
fore us-a jumble of low houses grace-
ful minarets rising toward the peaks of
babuna to reach allah the ruined tow-
ers where legendary king marko had
held court in the dim past loomed up to
the left

  we passed a little whitewashed church
and some women holding a service at a
grave in the churchyard crossed a small
bridge and were in the city

  at the inn the proprietor was drinking
his morning coffee-a corpulent man he
balkan bandits

was with a serious and meditative look
on his face he was glad to see my
father

  but why so early he inquired
where are you coming from you
couldnt be coming from monastir this
early then without waiting for an
answer he asked what will it be cof-
fee or brandy 

  both said my father

  the innkeeper as i later discovered
was a trusted man of the revolutionary
organization and his inn had regularly
been used by comitadji couriers disguised
as muleteers monks and itinerant saw-
yers and carpenters

  we left monastir yesterday ex-
plained my father and planned to reach
prilep last night but some ghegs took
our horses at ushi and we walked the
rest of the way we slept in allentzi
night caught us there but we did not
know strahil is no longer there

that we had been deprived of our
horses seemed to make little impres-
sion on the man for our having spent the
night in allentzi eclipsed in his mind
this incident of our journey

  in allentzi the innkeeper ex-
claimed startled in what house did
you stay there  he looked at my father
apprehensively a cracked note in his
voice betraying his excitement

  oh it was not a house my father
said it was a dozen houses under one
roof

  i am serious repeated the man tell
me in whose house you slept

  i took out my notebook and finding
the page on which i had written the
name of our host i read bogdan gola-
voda

  the innkeepers face blanched he
stared at us then moved his head slowly
from side to side as does a father when
he hears of some perilous exploit on the
part of his children did golavoda
know who you were  did he know any-
thing about you 

  no replied my father we said
little to him and he said less to us we
only asked about strahil it was he told
us strahil and his family had mtjved to
another village he did not ask us to be
his guests we invited ourselves

  one could see that the innkeeper was
disturbed he shook his head reproving-
ly at my father as much as to say
what a flogging you ought to have for
this bit of recklessness and taking
my father by the arm he led him into an-

other room where he could talk to him
without being overheard as to what he
said my father would tell me nothing

  we returned to our village with a herd
of oxen which we sold to the peasants at
a good profit but most of it went to pay
for the two horses which we never re-
covered

several years passed and i was
making ready to emigrate to america
while packing my things i came upon
some old school papers and notebooks and
i found the page on which i had written
bogdan golavoda and the address
notebook in hand i went out to look for
my father i found him in the yard
testing the loops of a wine-barrel

  father  asked excitedly do you
remember the name of that old man in
allentzi 

  yes he answered bogdan gola-
voda

  how did you remember it i wrote
it down here myself and i had forgot-
ten it

  laying down the adze and the chisel
my father said you do not know my
son how near we were to losing our lives
that night golavoda was a spy strahil
had not moved to another village but
had been killed by the turks and gola-
voda was responsible for his death one
night strahil had left his band of comi-
tadjis in a hiding-place and had slipped
into the village to see his wife and chil-
dren golavodas menials who had spied
strahil entering his house reported this
to him the old renegade rode to prilep
in the night and returned with a detach-
ment of turkish cavalry strahils house
was surrounded rather than fight from
within and endanger the lives of his fam-
ily strahil opened the door and bared
his breast to the volley of bullets

  one year after we met him gola-
voda was found stabbed in the meadow
near the spring

  who killed him

  oh i dont know

  but did you know when we went to
his house that he had caused strahils
death

  no-how should i the innkeeper
in prilep told me but i suspected some-
thing at the time thats why i did not
ask him any more questions or talk to
him much

  then why did we go to his house if
you suspected something i demanded

  we had to my son because-well we
had to sleep somewhere

     runyon of this cham-
     pion who here tells us
     his own story

by

   mickey
   walker

    arm and leg weary with two black
  eyes    jack britton stood in the center
  of the ring in the old madison square
  garden and watched a pug-nosed irish
  kids face break into a delirious grin as
  joe humphries announces winnah-
  and new welterweight champion

    fifteen hard tough rounds jack brit-
  ton and mickey walker fought and the
  older man bore up manfully to the last
  mickey youre the best man i ever
  fought he said

     fter i won the title jack and i
went on the stage a couple of
weeks we did a funny little bit
that theres no use describing here our
opening was at the old howard theater
in boston an old burlesque house where
john l sullivan jack dempsey and
nearly all the champions between those
two appeared

  we stayed at a place which come to
find out is bostons society hotel so we
decided to throw a party

  some acquaintances were invited and
then we invited some of the girls from
the show at the floward theater

  the girls didnt take long to start a
battle amongst themselves and these
girls might have made good in the prize-
ring

  i dont know yet what the fight was
about but it was a rip-snorter and we
nearly left the hotel a complete wreck
ever afterward that hotel barred fighters
and managers

my father wouldnt give us a minutes
rest until we promised him we
would fight in his home town holyoke
mass he wanted to show his old pals
what a great son he raised

  holyoke didnt go in for boxing in a
big way but the fans supported a small
club holding about eight hundred i
was scheduled to fight wildcat nelson
but the wildcat was sick that day and
jack substituted harlem eddie kelly
whom t knocked out some years before

  the day of the fight my old man
paraded me all over town they had to
push the buildings back to allow room
for his chest to pass i never knew i had
so many relations i was a cousin to
the whole town

  my old man liked to tell relations
about when i was a kid in curls and he
took me to a bricklayers outing it
ended in fighting and the men fighting
my father i naturally bit into-i mean
i bit into their legs so a man picked me
up and dropped me curls and all into
the tub where they iced the beer i had
on a new suit my mother must of paid 
cents for anyway it shrank and the
belt made a necktie on the way home
i was watching out for my mother but
she came around a corner sudden and she
gave the old man a terrible lacing just
look at the kids suit  she said   

  now i was the welterweight champ
scheduled to fight eddie kelly in


holyoke neither jack nor myself had
seen eddie since i boxed him last and it
was a shock to see him now he looked
like the fat man from the circus and was
in no shape to climb into a ring he col-
lapsed in the second round without being
hit

  in half a minute the ring was fdled
with chairs the angry mob was throwing
at us jack and i dashed into the dress-
ing-room grabbed our clothes and beat
it for the railroad station my father
came running behind

  well boys he says there was some
out-of-town people there

all in one years time

 philadelphia kayoed steve latzo

toronto kayoed max herscovitch six
  rounds

  so you see jack and i were getting
around   

  dave shade was coming up just then
but jacks ambition was a fight with
benny leonard the lightweight cham-
pion according to all fight dope this
fight would draw a million-dollar gate
and tex rickard is interested but it
took a lot of dickering benny has lots
of money and isnt in a hurry he is ap-
pearing in vaudeville in cleveland he
says he could lick mickey walker with-
out a doubt

a couple of days before i was to fight
johnny gill in philly again jack and i

were at a party in jack woods apart-
ment in the cumberland hotel in n y
jack complained of a stomach-ache
something that had never happened to
him before

i saw him the next day
  you get down to philly jack said
i dont feel just right but ill see you
the day of the fight

  on the afternoon of the fight we got a
phone-call that jack was in the hospital
near death his appendix had bursted

  i hopped a train never even thinking
to call off the fight at st michaels
hospital in newark i learned that jack
needed a blood-transfusion my blood
wouldnt match but his brothers come
out okay but jack died the next day

  maybe a few times in a lifetime you
can have someone near you die and leave
a great big empty place if it happened
often we couldnt go on living

after jacks death i was a champion
 on the loose i might have been a
pretty fair prize for a good manager but
i had ideas of my own i appointed joe
diegnan my front man jack and i
had made a lot of money together but
when he died we were both broke and it
was up to me to get a new stake i kept
right on where he left off-the leonard
match

  after wasting a lot of time and putting
myself in the red for a lot of money the
match was made for boyles thirty acres
in jersey city seeing what a great
money match it was the new york box-
ing commission had it moved to new
york

  the new york commission and i
never did get along even in my last days
of boxing bill muldoon was head of
the commission then a perfect gentleman
and the squarest shooter on two feet
we had a disagreement at the time of
the leonard match but years later
when i fought jack sharkey in brooklyn
muldoon stood up right in front of the
audience and said i was robbed from
that day until his death we were great
friends   

  to get back to the leonard fight
after all the ballyhoo it landed at the
polo grounds tex rickard was the
promoter

  i went into training and hired johnny
collins place in summit n j making
a private training-camp out of it alto-
gether the training expenses were ten
grand but i was forty more in the hole
jack bulger wouldnt have let me get in
this deep but without him i was kind
of reckless

  the leonard fight would fix me up
besides i didnt like these statements
he was handing out about what a easy
mark i would be in the ring even when

 its only newspaper talk it gets under
 your skin

   but the bubble busted the castles
 came tumbling down the plans of mice
 and men benny leonard took a warm-
 up fight with pal moran somewhere out
 west and came out of it with a busted
 hand he postponed the fight later
 on benny called off the fight altogether
 leaving me holding the bag

   i was in a tough spot i had debts to
 pay and nothing to use for money i had
 to grab a fight and grab it quick

   the purse was short in philly when
 i fought lew tendler but without let-
 ting them know i grabbed half of the
 guarantee like a drowning man this
 was a ten-round struggle that got swell
 write-ups but i was getting used to my
 name in the paper

   then i thought i was getting as good
 as jack in games of chance-anyway a
 little game after the fight and i was
 once again clean as a whistle

   to put it mildly my debtors were
 pressing    this bookkeeping is an
 awful bother

   well just then comes a offer from her-
 man taylor and bobby gunnis in philly
 to defend my title against bobby barrett
 - come one come all

   bobby barrett was a murderous punch-
 er the title was at stake

   the fight was held in the ball-park
 and the night of the fight turned cold
 in my dressing-room i was told the at-
 tendance didnt come up to expectations
 i didnt have to fight but all they could
 give was  finally i says okay
 -shoot


  a couple of minutes before i left my
dressing-room for the ring taylor come
in you better scram mick taylor
says we cant even make seventeen
and a half grand

  id boxed for taylor and gunnis be-
fore-they handed me twenty-five grand
without blinking an eye for boxing lew
tendler tonight i had to fight

  what can you make i says

  ten grand would do it taylor says

  he didnt know i would have taken
ten cents

  all right i says lets stop yapping
about it and call it ten grand

  so i went out to defend the title   

  i will never forget that night

  first of all when i reached the ball-
park i was given a dressing-room that a
preliminary fighter wouldnt take it
was so cold that when i was getting into
my tights one of the guys there was shiv-
ering in a coonskin coat then this room
was a regular hallway-everybody had
to pass through it going or coming from
the other rooms

  then i was called to get into ihe ring

  all i used to wear going in was my
tights shoes and a lightweight purple
sweater knitted by my mother for my
first fight i was kept waiting in the ring
in all that cold in the ball-park the
mob kept yelling for barrett yelling and
stamping their feet the yelling grew
into a roar i felt like roaring myself

barrett came in just in time to prevent
a riot all wrapped up in blankets retir-
ing to his corner like the sultan of
turkey

i couldnt wait for the bell to ring
with my teeth beating a tattoo that shook
my whole skeleton

the time always comes the bell
rang it was the signal to fight

  i tore across the ring like a shot

  before he could get out of his corner
with his hands in position barrett was
on the floor i was like a wild man
the weather wasnt cold for me any more

  barrett came up again but he bounced
right back to the canvas he came back
again and again only to hit horizontal
again with a thud that shook the ball-
park

  the mob was on its feet making noises
in the throat

  i connected with my worst left hook
and barrett was stretched out flat look-
ing up at the stars but the bell saved
him for the next round the bell rang
at the count of eight

bob cullen was in my corner that
night and started to rub me down
with a sponge

  never mind bob i said wrapping
my mothers old sweater around me
hell never come out of that one

  okay mickey bob said standing
there with his sponge dripping

  the bell rang and i still sat in my
corner i never expected barrett to get
on his feet to my surprise he come
charging like a wild bull

  like the feller said i jumped out of
my ring in the nick of time

  i started to box but barrett clipped
me on the side of the head with a long
real experiences

right-hand swing that nearly knocked
my head off a bump as big as a grape-
fruit started to raise on my head

  i walked into a clinch to think

  the worst thing a fighter can do is to

lose his head i mustnt get too mad

and i made up my mind that the next
time i put bobby barrett down i would
put him down to stay

  it took me four dangerous rounds to
do it and i boxed as i never boxed for a
title before or since because i knew if
i got one of those barrett punches square
it would be curtains for mickey walker

  from the second round on i kept nail-
ing him in the belly i knew i was hurt-
ing him because he nearly went down
several times but every time i nailed
him and see him going toward the floor
i would rush in and lock his arm in mine
i didnt want him on the floor until i had
the convincer ready

  the opening of the sixth round showed
me he was ripe

  i gave it and he took it

  barrett went to the floor and out like
a light

i boxed jock malone in newark at
the time dempsey was making a
personal appearance at the loews the-
ater there the manassa mauler said he
would be at the fight

  jack dempsey was my favorite fighter
when i won jack brittons title and was
a champ myself one day i drove up to
saratoga to watch dempsey train i
will never forget the thrill of that mo-
ment the first time we ever met and the
grin he gave me   

  the last time i had fought malone
was in boston malone had trimmed me
okay in boston but now dempseys
presence must have put new fight in me

  i pummeled poor old jock with all the
strategy i had ever learned to show
dempsey what a great boxer i really
was and then as if i did it on purpose i
clouted malone right over the ropes into
the lap of jack dempsey dempsey did
not exactly receive malone with open

arms but after a while he grinned the
same grin he had at saratoga

  malone and i boxed three or four times
after that the last time was in ma-
lones home town st paul which is why
he got the name of the st paul phan-
tom ifts a good thing they like jock
in st paul or we would have both been
thrown in jail for impersonating fighters

  i	had run into jock in willie webbs
place in chicago where jock was a bar-
tender

  being a little short of money mick
says jock couldnt you and me box
some place

  how about st paul  says doc
kearns with an eye to business

  but when we come into the ring we
looked like two paul whitemans before
paul reduced our fight must of looked
like two flappers practicing the snakes
hip i won the newspaper decision but
we both stayed the full twelve rounds
fighting our way into shape and a fine
battle

  about this time i fought mike mc-
tigue in newark for the light heavy-
weight championship the newspapers to
give the decision new jerseys law for-
bidding ring judgments

  i	got a gold cup presented by a ray-
nor proclaiming me the new champ of
tke world this championship did not
mean much in those days i didnt give
the gold cup much attention but mike
was a generous loser and it was a good
fight it cleaned up most of my debts

next month mickey
walker tells of other
fights and of presenting
a pair of golden gloves
to president coolidge-
who promised to use
them on congress
