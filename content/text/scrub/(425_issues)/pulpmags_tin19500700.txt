when professor elstan turned from his
bench to get a piece of apparatus he
needed for his work shor was standing
there in the centre of the laboratory with
nothing on

   the professor was a thin tired looking
man who was probably no more than fifty
years of age but he looked all of sixty his
stooped shoulders straightened slightly as
he peered at shor through thick-lensed
glasses there was an annoyed cast to the
smile he gave the naked man the sort oi
smile one might give to a welcome friend
who has called at the wrong time

  and what may i do for you queried
the scientist mildly

   i have work to do shor said quietly
his voice flat and without expression

  then might  suggest you get about it
and leave me to mine suggested elstan
with equal calm

   -he was -about -to -take jin the piece ol
equipment he needed and turn back to his
bench when he stopped suddenly looked
again at the man who had so suddenly ap-

-	peared - out - of nowhere -and  then  pointed
vaguely at a dust-coat hanging behind the
door of the bam which was serving as his
laboratory

  you might put that coat on before you
leave i have a feeling mrs mander might
be rather shocked if she were to see you
like that

  there was an amused smile to his lips
as his thoughts dwelt for a moment on the
possible reactions of his house-keeper to
the sudden appearance of this man before

her when he didnt hear the door close
behind the intruder he looked up again
rather more annoyed than previously shor
was still standing in that same position but
pow his eyes were roving round the barn
systematically noting all the equipment
and materials which were available

   he was a tall man of the high-browed
well feathered type and his age could have
been anything from thirty to sixty he was
such an indefinable character that elstan
looked at him with more curiosity now he
couldnt recall ever having seen a man quite
like him what it was about him that made
shor so different elstan couldnt be sure
but after a moment or two of consideration
he decided that it was the complete lack of
expression shown on his face it was al-
most mask-like in its perfection of feautre
and then only was it that elstan noted that
shors face was completely without hair like
a womans but shor was most certainly a
man

   well demanded elstan irritably then
must i detain you you should know

 -well- e-non-g-h- that-youd- be-i-n-esr-ious- trouble
 if the guards were to find you here this
 laboratory is strictly secret what with the
 threat of war with the east its most essen-
 tial that my experiments be completed
 now will you take the coat and leave
 quietly

  i have work to do shor said again
just as coldly as before

  then for goodness sake do it and be
gone snapped elstan testily how much
more time must i waste on you
 stood in shocked stillness as
her eyes stared at the ghastly
sight  the rigid body of the
professor had about it a luminous
glow of life yet there wasnt a move-
ment from him as the rats made
their meal   

ne utraliser

  my work is here replied shor quietly
thats ridiculous snapped the pro-
fessor sharply i need no assistant and
have asked for none you have come to
the wrong place now off with you
this is the place replied shor softly
and then he moved for the first time

  there was a liquid sort of grace to his
movements as he began to gather pieces ol
material and apparatus from the shelves and
cupboards packed around the bam elstan
was startled for a moment and then angry

he couldnt see the funny side of such a
practical joke as this

  put those things down and be gone he
rapped out sharply

  shor ignord him and elstan fished into
the pocket of his laboratory coat and pro-
duced a small automatic pistol which fired
tiny shells of surrender drug

  all right he snapped at shor then
put those things back and march for the
door im turning you over to the guard
ive had enough of this nonsense and
page

put that coat on before you leave the
laboratory

  put that toy away advised shor
quietly no trace of a change of expression
on his face i have work to do and little
time to accomplish it ive no time to waste
with you

  do as i say or ill be forced to fire on
you warned the professor doubtfully
firing the will-snapping drug wasnt some-
thing he wanted to do but this fellow was
forcing his hand why had the guards lei
him through their lines	

  so foolish of you said shor mildly

  as he did so he stared hard into the
depths of elstans eyes and the automatic
fell from nerveless fingers as the professors
whole body became rigid with his arms
down straight at his sides without a second
glance at elstan shor picked up the rigid
body and carried it over and leaned it in
the corner of the laboratory out of his way

  there was no breathing no pulse to
record in that stiff body but somehow it
seemed certain that elstan still lived-as if
in a suspended state of living as if he had
been suddenly subjected to a deep-freezing
from which he could be later thawed when-
ever shor chose

  but the man had forgotten the professor
apparently and he tinkered with the video
apparatus for a time and added extra parts
and disconnected several sections of the
complicated apparatus at last he began
speaking into the microphone

  shor calling from minus three thous-
and he said quietly and then repeated
this statement

  report at once came a crackling voice
back from the instrument

  am located in the laboratory of pro-
fessor elstan as planned all materials are
available or capable of being muted from
elements here will commence work im-
mediately

  good work shor carry on but what
of the professor

  regret to report that it has been neces-
sary to devitalize him temporarily the
interruption to his work should not affecl
our plans

  be most careful warned the voice from
the other end we wish to leave no trace
of our coming or going

  x understand replied shor slowly

shor signing off from minus three thous-
and

   when the instrument ceased to crackle
shor turned it off and began immediately to
work with various pieces of equipment he
had brought from the cupboards his con-
centration on the task in hand became more
and more intense as the hours wore on and
elstan would have marvelled at the things
he was doing with elements like lead and
iron

   from them shor was muting various rare
metals he found necessary for his work it
was twelve mid-night by this time and the
light burned brightly from the special at-
tachment above the bench in the process
of his work shor found it necessary from
time to time to use some part of the ap-
paratus and he ruthlessly took the com-
ponents he needed from the professors
experimental set-up

  and so deep in concentration was he
that he didnt hear the squeaking chatter
coming from the corner of the room where
he had propped the professor so that he
would be out of way

   it was mrs mander tired of waiting up
with supper for the professor who finally
noted the horror of it three large rats
were fighting over the meal they were mak-
ing from the professors left leg professor
elstan unknowing remained stiff and
rigid no blood flowed from the gnawed
wound the rats made

  when mrs mander plump and smooth
faced came bustling to the door of the
barn to take her master to task for keeping
her waiting she was fidgeting with her grey
hair contriving to make the bun more pre-
sentable at the door she stopped and a
long indrawn gasp of horror was the only
sound she made she stood in shocked
stillness as her eyes stared at the ghastly
sight

   the rigid body of the professor had about
it a luminous glow of life yet there wasnt
a movement from him as the rats made their
meal mrs mander stood a full minute
before the high shrill scream broke from
her lips in one long shuddering screech of
sound it was enough to snap shor from
his concentrated work at the bench and his
movements perked the womans eyes in his
direction she caught one glimpse of his
naked bodv above the bench and fled before
shor could act	-

  help help she cried in hysterical
sobs of choking sound as she ran pell-mell
toward the guards quarters about a hund-
red yards away

  shor knew that he would have to work
fast now and switched the adjusted video
apparatus on and called

  shor reporting from minus three thous-
and shor reporting from minus three
thousand

  shor to report a voice crackled from
the instalment

  work incomplete have been dis-
covered guards being called what
orders have i

  how much more time have you to com-
plete assignment

  one hour shor reported back quickly
  very well snapped the voice tersely

you have it suitable adjustments have
been made to the time apparatus here
carry on

  shor signing off shor from minus three
thousand signing off

  the instrument went dead and shor re-
turned to his work at the bench he now
had an hour before he would be disturbed
again when he looked at the clock on the
shelf above the bench he realised that it was
reading eleven of the night a moment ago
it had been registering twelve mid-night
but no alteration had been made to the
clock

  it was simply a matter of adjustment of
the instruments at the control end which
displaced him through one hour in time but
his naked flesh was all that could be dis-
placed so that the equipment he was wor-
king on was completed to a stage where hed
left it at twelve mid-night but he was now
working one hour earlier having gained an
hour of time he needed

  his complete concentration was shattered
suddenly by the ear-piercing scream from
the door of the barn and he looked up in
time to catch a glimpse of the fleeing
woman she was plump and grey-haired
and he guessed that she must be the house-
keeper the professor had spoken of he
could hear her screams as she fled and knew
that the guards would be coming any mom-
ent eagerly working against time he
checked-the gadget he had made and then
proceeded to mute some lead into a sil-
very metal which he worked into a com-
plete shell over his equipment so that the
rectangular shape about the size of a foot-
thing was completely sealed into a rough
ball

  just as he completed this he noted that
three rats were eating a meal from the pro-
fessor and he rushed to the man and fright-
ened the rodents away then he stared into
the glazed eyes for a moment and elstan
was suddenly alive and agile and crying a
little at the pain from the wound in his left
leg where the blood now flowed freely

  seeing the seriousness of the situation
the professor found dressing and bandages
in a kit kept for that purpose and began an
effort to staunch the flow of blood from
the wounds meanwhile shor had run to
the door and saw that three guards were
coming toward the barn laboratory at the
double he caught sight of the menacing
weapons they carried and spun around and
gathered up the small automatic with its
shells of surrender drug

  taking a quick glimpse of the gun he saw
the obvious way to use it and returned to
the door from where he sighted the guards
now less than twenty yards from the bam
from behind the door he took rapid aim
and fired a first tiny shell assured that it
had found its target he loosed two more
missiles just as accurately

  all three guards moved forward slug-
gishly now though no wound showed to re-
veal where the tiny shells had pierced their
skins they came like automatons their
movements sluggish and hands hanging lim-
ply at their sides their weapons having fal-
len from them when they reached the door
shor turned to the professor and asked
quickly

  what do  do with these men now

  make any command and theyll obey
page

replied the scientist truthfully for he saw no
point in lying to this strange creature who
had so suddenly and inexplicably appeared
in his laboratory how did i wound my
leg he asked shor then

  i forgot you im afraid shor said
calmly three rats were making a meal
from you

  a shudder of revulsion passed through
elstan and he backed away from the clean-
faced stranger as if he didnt belong to el-
stans world at all as if he had suddenly
come from unknown parts but shor was
busy gathering up the small sealed gadget
he had worked on with such intense con-
centration during all the hours since he had
suddenly appeared to take over the pro-
fessors laboratory with his cryptic an-
nouncement that he had work to do

  whats that you have asked the scien-
tist curiously feeling no pain now that he
had given himself a shot of pain-sense anti-
dote k

  the object for which i came to make
replied shor calmly the evasive answer
only awakening the scientists curiosity still
more

  and what purpose will it serve elstan
asked the three guards standing sluggishly
in the doorway all this time

  it will make the inevitable future inevit-
able replied shor truthfully but the ans-
wer only seemed to confuse the professor
who was considered one of the most brilli-
ant men of his day

  please explain he said humbly

  it is simple shor spoke fluentlythe
chain of events that form the pattern of
time are inevitable down to the smallest
detail-what you might call fate-but
nevertheless to ensure that this pattern is
so at certain points in history it is neces-
sary that outside influences are set to work
all are preconceived in the pattern and so
are nothing but a part of it

  then you would say that man can do
nothing to provoke or prevent war asked
the professor solemnly

  exactly nodded shor seriously the
pattern is inevitable if war is in the
pattern of time at a certain point then it will
occur whether or not men strive for and
against it since all these strivings are but
parts of the pattern themselves

  then-since you claim to know so
much-perhaps you could assure me that
the east and west will not war one on the
other with the civilization-destroying helium
atom bombs

  strange that you should ask that my
mission in the pattern is to see that such a
war did not take place that is the reason
for my labors my appearance here

  why come naked and why do you speak
of this war as if it were already past when
it has not yet commenced queried the
professor

  my transport will allow me to come with
nothing but myself explained shor
sombrely one gets used to it for the
rest-the war  have come to stop is in my
past

  but youre here protested the pro-
fessor testily youre some ridiculous
crank ive stood enough of you

  i am at minus three thousand from my
day snapped shor showing something
approaching feeling for the first time that
means that the war is past for me
youre claiming you have come from
the future asked elstan wonderingly
precisely admitted shor

  but such travel through time is a mere
trick of the writers of fiction stories pro-
tested the scientist desperately

  im afraid not im here arent 
queried shor

  then its ridiculous spat out the pro-
fessor irritably you have come from the
future to prevent a war which you already
know has not occurred what nonsense
you misunderstand the concept of
time shor replied patiently as  ex-
plained before-time is a pattern not a
series of events one following another
imagine it as a carpet woven in many
colors with many threads then it is simple
to see that to ensure a certain pattern at
the one end a thread may have to be drawn
from the other and woven through a myriad
of other patterns alusimply to give the final
desired design

  then    began elstan quickly

  i have no more time replied shor
coldly think of a many hued carpet and
imagine time as such an endless carpet
i can tell you no more guards bring
an atomic rocket plane i must deliver my
atomic neutroliser

page 

work to its rightful place before it is too
late

  a new lease of life seemed to come into
the men then as they saluted smartly and
wheeled round with military and automaton
precision a few moments later an atomic
rocket plane settled down just outside the
door of the barn laboratory

  ill take this little gun shor told the
professor it maybe very convenient

  then the naked man stepped through the
door into the night and a moment later the
drugged guards were taking him aloft in the
ship

  elstan was puzzled for a time but he soon
was certain that the man was an impostor-
a spy for the east who were planning a
secret and immediate attack on the west
once having decided that this was the
logical explanation of the behaviour he ran
to the video apparatus and switched it on

  elstan calling group  he called
urgently fiddling with a dial which shor had
seen fit to cut out of the complicated cir-
cuit elstan calling group  elstan
calling group 

  shor report in shor who is that

fool meddling with our communications
shor report in immediately

  shor has gone to deliver the thing he
made snapped the professor and im not
a fool

  then stop interrupting our communica-
tions thanks for the report on shor
crackled the voice in reply

  who are you queried elstan curiously
zero year for reorientation came the
incomprehensible reply you are minus
three thousand

  hell snarled elstan angrily then
what will they think of next to bring con-
tusion before attack

  quitting the barn he hurried to the house
where he found mrs mander in a state of
near collapse but he glanced at her but
casually as he hurried to the video equip-
ment and repeated his call

  elstan calling group  elstan calling
group 

  come in elstan snapped a brisk
voice through the speaker screen your-
self for identification

  elstan turned the switch and knew that
at group  his face would be showing on

the video screen then he was flashed an
answering identification screening and
elstan spat out his urgent message

  have reason to believe that east is about
to attack us he sent quickly suggest all
preparations for the atomic-powered-pilot-
less helium atom bombs regret that my
counter measure equipment is not com-
pleted

  message received all precautions al-
ready taken west has already dispatched
large forces of the bombs you mention to
pattern bomb the entire east if ours reach
their targets first we may have a chance of
survival came the terse reply

  professor elstan signed off then and
switched to a general transmission wave-
length and hoped to hear any progress that
might come of the attacks believed to be
already launched by both east and west
with the devastation area of each bomb
being one hundred miles in radius a plan
had been worked out so that a huge number
of bombs could be launched simultaneously
set for definite targets so that all devastation
areas would overlap and so wipe out the
whole civilisation of the east

  the tension that had mounted between
the east and west was such that each sus-
pected the other of planning annihilation
and so both had tried to protect themselves
by destroying the other now whistling
through the stratosphere huge fleets of
helium atom bombs were destined to destroy
the complete civilizations of both east and
west

  helium bombs have been falling over
metropilis territory for a half hour all
have so far failed to explode came the
joyous news from the video here is a
screening of one such monster

  and onto the screen flashed the huge
helium bomb zooming down under the
atomic power of its rocket tubes and then
shattering harmlessly into the earth with
nothing more than a crash of splintered
metal

  the authorities announce that our
bombs are already launched to pattern-
bomb the east from existence a further
report came no western bombs have so
far landed on enemy territory

  attention attention cried a voice
over the video the east offers uncondi-
tional surrender to the west if the helium

bomb raid is recalled the heavily accented
voice cried

  it was obvious that the east knew of the
complete failure of their helium bombs and
were now completely at the mercy of the
bombs of the west the voice had been
that of the chief high officer of the east

  then a few minutes later another voice
broke the video silence with the reply to the
easts surrender terms

  the terms of surrender by the east are
accepted by the west all helium bombs
have been ordered back to base attention
bomb destined for your metropilis one is
not responding to signal take precautions

  but it was too late to take precautions
and the people of easts metropilis one
stood in the streets and watched the helium
bomb zooming down from the skies over
the city there was the fascination of the
lost hope in watching that dreadful missile
zoom closer to them it struck the ground
with terrific force and the whole thing was
shattered asunder but there was no ex-
plosion

  east calling west we are withdrawing
surrender terms your helium bombs are
equally ineffective with ours suggest con-
ference to bridge differences

  west agreeable was the terse reply

  elstan relaxed back away from the video
apparatus where he had been crouched and
his mind suddenly flashed to shor who had
said that events would be such but how
could a small gadget made in the space of
a few hours and sealed in a small rect-
angular metal container possibly neutralize
all atomic explosions on earth how could
it be

  but when elstan thought back to that
vaguely distant past time when the first
atomic explosions were made he knew
that the advancements since then were such
that the future must be crowded with
amazements for the scientist and slowly
he began to understand what shor had
ment without the atomic neutralizer at
work civilization would have been destroyed
and there could have been no future for
man so out of the future had come a man
with a way to ensure the reality of the
future from which he came

  right then elstan knew that he had a
tremendous task to perform for science he
had to detain shor and see that he revealed
atomic neutroliser

page 

his scientific secrets for the benefit of
elstans age

  already there was this new concept ol
time-the idea of pattern which made time
travel reasonable there must be much
more hurriedly he contacted group 
and they agreed to assist though his ex-
planation of shor was wildly reckless sincc
he didnt understand it fully himself elstan
had managed to convey a pressure of sulfi-
cient urgency to set group  acting

  when the atomic rocket plane settled
gently down outside the barn laboratory
shor stepped out and he was without the
object he had been so anxious to establish
at its rightful place and there was a relaxed
weary expression breaking through the cold
and expressionless mask shor was well
content with his activities and it did not
detract from his achievement to know that
it had to be in such a fashion that things
happened

  all he wanted now was the safety of his
return to his own lime and the rewards he
would receive there by way of honors and
titles for his weaving of an important thread
in the carpet of time

  halt called a group of voices from all
around him in the night

  who is that shor demanded calmly
seemingly unafraid

  elstan and some friends the professor
leplied calmly we have decided that we
are not allowing you to return to your own
time you have top much of value to us

  guards called shor calmly open
fire

  the three guards in the rocket plane
under the influence of the surrender drug
opened fire on the force of group  and
elstan moved calmly toward the barn
laboratory

  the use of the surrender drug on me
would ruin me for your purposes he called
too you darent risk shootin for the
wound might not be a minor one the
guards will keep you occupied while i retire
quietly	

  but suddenly the guards were no longer
active for elstan had failed to mention that
the surrender drug produced final collapse
and death after a relatively short time the
sudden burst of activity had hastened this in

the case of the three affected by shors
shooting	

  immediately the group  men who still
remained alive rushed with professor elstan
into the barn and in a moment they were
swarming all over shor as he worked at the
video apparatus he had adjusted

  shor reporting from minus three thous-
and he cried as he fought off three at-
tackers desperately shor reporting get
me out of this mission complete

  but slowly he was dragged away from the
apparatus and tied then with elstan
sitting directly before him the men from
group  the scientific branch of the wests
defences began to ask their questions
eagerly and shor squirmed under the utter
futility of trying to explain his knowledge to
such fools as these men who passed for
scientists in this age

  at his present position the time-device in
his own day would not pick him up and
so he knew that he had to be free besides
the pattern demanded that no record be left
of his coming or his going thus it was
in the pattern of things

  slowly his eyes burned deeply into
elstans as he caught his eye the pro-
fessor went rigid and life was held in
abeyance then using all his cunning
shor manoeuvred each of the others into
a suitable position and within five minutes
they were all tense and rigid and only one
flaw remained in the plan he himself was
tied down and helpless

  he called loudly and at last mrs mander
came and this time she checked her shock
lor the mans eyes caught hers as she came
through the door and she moved closer to
him and he uttered his order the glazed
eyes of the woman stared back into his as
her hands worked the knots loose and he
was released then sitting the woman
down in the chair he bent the power of his
will on her through his eyes and she
stiffened into rigidity like the others

  shor ready for return called the man
into the video

  shor about to return the voice came
back

  a few moments later shor was whisked
through three thousand years in an instant
the last thing he heard in the bam labora-
tory was the hungry squeaking of many rats
    clive krane set out to capture the cleverest gang
of inter-planetary hi-jackers ever known    pirates
who attacked from nowhere and then vanished intos
space

clive krane turned away from the
window marked venus transport and
faced the isp official across his desk

   from the time you leave this office youll
be in deadly danger the official said we
arent dealing with occasional cases of
space piracy this is a well organised
group of saboteurs pirates and assassins
backed by a ring of powerful and un-
scrupulous men some of them in high
places-

  krane laughed harshly doesnt sound
like a rest cure whyd you pick me for
the job

  you were recommended by the
ministry of transport also you were
transferred from the mars-jupiter sector
because you are unknown here any other
regular isp men would have been recog-
nised at once our original idea was to
place you aboard a transport as a crewman
to spy out the weak links in our defensive

measures but a matter of graver import-
ance has come up the assignments will
overlap but we can no longer give you any
official backing

  youd better bring me up to date said
krane bluntly

  the pattern is usually the same bar-
ratry three of the venus transports have
been deliberately wrecked and looted of
plutonium for the most part members- of
this criminal group have been among the
crew even trusted officers have been made
to assist the plotters by the use of black-
mail or other methods we can trust no
one not even the captain two days ago
we arrested a man on a charge of barratry
we had no name only a heliophoto from
venus in his possession we found docu-
ments of vital political importance release
of this information could cause chaos-even
war

        he caught a glimpse of the blaster in hamlins hand  he spun
    round and hurled the wrench in one motion but hamlin had al-
    ready pulled the trigger   

space
  krane grunted such documents have
no right to exist

  i agree unfortunately this one does
exist and its no longer in our hands a
woman obviously an accomplice got a
blaster gun to our prisoner two isp were
killed and the prisoner escaped the docu-
ments went with him both these fugitives
must be caught and killed and those papers
must either be brought back or destroyed
thats your job

   i dont like it and i dont like work-
ing out of uniform

   you werent asked if you liked it with
two black marks against your record you
cant afford an opinion one more and
youre through as an officer of the space

patrol-

   i still dont like it

  i wouldnt count too much on your
friendship with paul hall if i were you
krane hes through here-even if he was
kicked upstairs into the
transport ministry we
no longer approve his
methods his rough shod
undisciplined met hods
may get by in the frontier
civilisations like those of
the outer planets but
nowadays we require efficiency the time
is past when the isp man can forget to
change his uniform and go without shaving
for days at a time

   kranes eyes glittered there was more
to paul hall than pretty braid and a uni-
form he was a man for your information
those black marks on my record are for
tearing apart superior officers who made
cracks about paul hall do you want me
to turn in my badge

   whats the matter the job too tough for
you

  listen snapped krane the jobs
dont come too tough relax big-shot ill
run your stinking little errand for you but
its the last one when i hand your bad-
man over to you im through make out
my resignation that way and ill sign it be-
for i leave

   right the official threw a card across

the desk theres the man you want
that picture wont help you much since
hell probably be wearing a plastic face
mask

  krane glanced at it and shrugged thats
not much to go on any other leads

  yes the official glanced at his wrist-
chron we know that he will be on the
venus transport x--the astronout
-which leaves in three hours probably
the woman too whatever happens they
must not reach venus alive

  and remember added the official the
astronaut is an unarmed emigrant ship
there will be a space patrol following you
if you strike any trouble signal them-by
helio flash if possible-and theyll come run-
ning i suggest you contact the man first
and through him find the woman oh yes
your friend paul hall will be aboard and
you can contact him if you feel like it

  have you figured out how im to get
on the astronaut if
shes an emigrant ship
theyll take only married
couples the company
wants settlers to colonise
venus and build up
their plantations for
them

  thats your problem marry someone
if you have to or hire a fake wife its
been done now get going youve got less
than three hours to take off time

the bee-hive activity of the ticket office

slackened off as take-off time drew near
the nuggety little booking clerk behind the
grill was tired and his tone of long suffer-
ing patience had worn to a thread of annoy-
ance

  clive looked fondly at the little man over
the heads of the surging crowd it wasnt
so long ago that art grogan had been one
of the best chief engineers in the isp
rocket service five years ago the ship
both he and clive were serving on had been
jumped by a small fleet of pirate craft near
saturn in the victorious fight which fol-
lowed art had been maimed for life when
a blaster beam had seared his ship clive
had risked his ship to nurse the little man

back to life and he knew that art had
never forgotten needless to say the isp
had dropped art like a ton of bricks after
according to him an ironic heros send-off

  the person in front of krane hurried ofl
and he was able to approach the window
 lo art he grinned got a pair of
tickets for a foot-loose space-man who wants
to get to venus in a hurry

  art looked up and a genuine smile of
welcome lit his face as he recognised the
lean figure at his window the same old
clive he grinned guess you know 
cant sell tickets to anyone but married
couples still if i know you a little thing
like that wont stand in your way for long
eh

  how right you are in less than half
an hour one clive krane expects to be
hitched  but only for a glorious two
weeks he laughed aloud at the look on
arts face well can you fix it you sawn-
off space rat	

  youre in luck art answered this
is the last pair of tickets for the entire
ship but i warn you clive    youd better
have your papers and a wife when you
try to get past the purser

  clive waved his thanks and good-byes as
he walked off in the direction of the nearest
honky-tonk in search of a floozy who he
could persuade to fall in with his plans after
waving a roll of notes in front of her nose

  the figure of a girl that had been stand-
ing behind krane during his conversation
with art hesitated a second then hurried
after him and tapped him on the shoulder
clive turned and saw a young girl expen-
sively dressed almost too well groomed with
honey blonde hair a haughty manner and
an icy stare in her violet eyes

  ignoring his look she rapped out ill
give you a thousand for those tickets
not even if you said please

  please and two thousand

  stop it youre getting too near my
price besides it wouldnt do you any good
you need a husband to go with them
three thousand

  clive whistled you must need them
pretty badly look ill make a deal with
you ill sell you half of my double for
one thousand five hundred providing you
marry me

  marry you there was a note of loath-
ing in her tone

  he turned away forget i mentioned it

if im to be stuck with a girl for three
months- dont want it to be you

  you win-i guess ill do even that
krane laughed wickedly dont flatter
yourself youre just a ticket to venus for
me meet me in the marriage bureau in
half an hour we havent much time and
youll have to be psychographed by the
way im clive crane	

  im noni moore-in half an hour

  the rocket transport left its runaway at
an angle of  degrees slanting up into the
silent night with a blossom of pink-white
flame flowering around the bell-shaped
stern jets the warning alarms ceased their
blaring and the series of muffled vibrations
smoothed to a muffled burr

  krane hunched himself ofl the shock-
couch and looked over towards the girl he
saw that she was out cold he crossed the
cabin in quick strides and picked up her
purse and went through it methodically
the only thing that interested him was a
small photo in an ivory frame of the man
whose face was on the security head-
quarters dossier card krane neutralised the
charge in her blaster-also found in the bag
-and replaced everything as he had found
it he wished that he had a pocket magna-
scope to study the color photo in detail
but that could wait he must check the
passenger lists and find where paul halls
room was located paul would have to be
warned so that his surprise at seeing krane
would not give the game away

  the girl stirred and moaned feebly
krane found the emergency medical locker
and forced an anti-acceleration capsule be-
tween her tight clenched teeth following it
with a water concentrate capsule she would
be wildly thirsty when she came out of it
and real water would have some very un-
pleasant effects during a-shock he leaned
over and checked the straps they were
tight enough so that she would never get
out of them without help her eyes-blinked
open as she stared at him in panic

  just relax he cautioned and dont
be impatient ill be right back have to

see a man about-

  he went outside and made his way with
difficulty up the bleak passage forward the
distorted gravity made walking extremely
difficult once outside the main gravity
field of earth artificial gravity fields would
be turned on until then only an experi-

enced spaceman could get around with cer-
tainty krane was grateful for the rigorous
training of the isp

  a staccato bark of unintelligible verbal
commands came through the door of the
control room ahead the captains office
should be somewhere about here on
kranes right was a closed door marked
captain krane knocked twice without
receiving any answer then tried the door
it slid open easily he stepped over the
high threshold and the sight that met his
eyes brought an involuntary gasp to his lips

  sprawled forward half across the desk
was the captains body the upper part of
his head had been blown away by a blaster
gun evidently fired at close quarters

  a cry from behind swung krane around
in the frame of the open door-way stood
the purser mouth open pointing at the
dead man with a trembling finger instinc-

tively krane started for the door the
purser sprang into action leaped on krane
and caught him in a surprisingly strong grip
for so slight a man krane made no attempt
to struggle in a moment the office was full
of people the burly first mate pulled the
purser away from krane

  whats all this hamlin the mate de-
manded

  i heard a sound in the captains office
and when i came to investigate i found
him hamlin explained the captains
been murdered

  mate harriman looked krane up and
down wheres the gun he barked

  how should i know i just came up
here a minute ago he was like this when
i got here

  harriman drove a fist full into kranes
mouth come on you dont expect us
to believe a yarn like that wheres the
gun

  krane spat blood from his mangled lips

  i dont know anything about it i came
up here to check the passenger list and was
told back at the space port that i should
have to see the captain

  the purser nodded agreement

  i want to see the first mate krane said
the words seemed to recall harriman to
his duties im the first mate he said i
havent time to bother with you now ill
take care of you later throw him into the
locker rooms ill have to take over for the
old man

  krane had been flung into the cramped
quarters of the ships locker room more than
a day ago when hamlin come in and sat
down

  youre in a bad spot krane its cus-
tomary in cases of civilian infractions of
ships rules to appoint an officer as council
for their defence im yours theyre giving
you a hearing in the wardroom id suggest
you co-operate with me by telling me any-
thing that will help in your case i dont
mind telling you that your storys too weak
to hold up ill do all i can for you but
youll have to help

  what am  supposed to do krane
grunted

  you might tell the truth we know that
the captain was killed just as the ship took
off if you can prove that you were some-
where else at the time-

  i was with my wife she can bear wit-
ness for me

  it wont do krane i should have told
you before that your wife is ill i found
her myself strapped to the bunk in your
cabin martian plague i called the doctor
who examined her then quarantined the
cabin we left concentrated food and water
warned her not to leave then locked and
sealed the cabin no one can see her
krane went cold with anger someone
must really be trying to foul me up he
raged she couldnt have the martian
plague-shes never been off the earth
your papers read that you came from
mars corrected hamlin

  i did we were married just before the
ship left if i were carrying the plague id

have it myself she couldnt have it-

  hamlin laughed nervously i wash i
could convince the doctor of that hes been
taking blood tests of me ever since we left
her im sorry for you krane but she has
it i saw the grey tash myself its horrible
page

  kranes mind worked like lightning
what am i charged with he asked

  deliberate murder and plotting against
the welfare of the ship if the officers agree
on your guilt you can be put through an
airlock immediately the regulations have
to be pretty stringent on a space-ship
krane stood up lets go up and get it
over with he said well see about your
regulations

  the assembled officers stared at krane
curiously his lip was still bruised and
swollen he stared insolently at the group
and concentrated on the immediate hurdle
in order to get out of this mess harriman
wet his lips and opened the hearing

  i wont waste words when we all know
why were here the captain of this ship
was foully murdered and this man who
calls himself clive krane was found stand-
ing over the body there was no gun in
the room and none on the prisoner his
papers seem to be in order but may be
forgeries that can be checked his wife
is in quarantine and unable to testify one
way or the other

  krane broke in i demand to hear the
formal charge against me

  harriman read the charge much as
hamlin had already guessed downstairs

  good now i make formal demand that
my wife be called as witness

  you heard me say that your wife was
in quarantine she will not be able to
testify if you have anything else to say
in your defence speak up

  i make no defence i will stand on
my civilian rights as a technicality this
court has no jurisdiction over me the most
you can do is to confine me to this ship
until a charge can be brought against me
in an admiralty court in venus also
under security law no f  since the
one witness i have asked to have called in
my defence has not appeared in court i
demand that the whole hearing be dropped
as illegal

  harrimans jaw dropped do you expect
to get away with this and then in moment-
ary desperation he glanced around the room
at the circle of faces and saw that krane
had him over a barrel the hard-faced
astro-navigator spoke up better send for
hall-hes from the ministry of transport
and should know the correct procedure
the officers remained silent while paul
was called when he arrived the situation

was explained to him by harriman in a
monotonously levelled tone of repressed
fury

  well gentlemen said paul hall as
far as i can see the prisoner is within his
rights even if the circumstances are un-
usual we have no alternative but to release
him however i recommend that he be
under the constant watch of some competent
officer once venus has been reached the
man can be turned over to the proper
authorities

  krane broke in roughly does all this
monkey talk mean that im free

  harriman was maliciously official im
afraid it does krane but dont try any-
thing funny hamlin and nalson im de-
tailing you two to watch over krane in
shifts if he tries anything - shoot him
since he has no room he will share yours
for the remainder of the voyage

  hall glanced at him with an odd expres-
sion if the acting-captain has no objec-
tions id like a word with krane in private
harriman was curious but nodded
are you sure youll be safe with him
hall smiled thats my worry after
twelve years in the space patrol im used
to handling bad boys

  nine days out the astronaut ran into
trouble proximity alarms blared wildly it
was only a small asteroid not more than a
quarter of a mile in diameter just a jagged
piece of rock and fused metal but it came
out of a direct line with the sun moving
fast and discipline had been dangerously
lax after harriman had taken over com-
mand

  at  ships time there came the sound
of a rending crash up forward followed by
a nauseating sense of shock and withering
waves of motion energy transformed into
heat fortunately the collision was a
glancing one but enough the spacer was
a shattered wreck her bow and the control
room were carried away bodily and only
the space tight bulk-heads of the waist saved
the passengers and crew from instant death

  at  far off course leaking air dan-
gerously from sprung seams the doomed
transport and the asteroid circled each other
like wary- wrestlers awaiting an opening
sooner or later as the initial force of the
spin died down they would crash together
in a flaming holocaust in the meantine
all that could be done was being done
space pirates inc

pag it

  orders went out to abandon ship of the
original complement of  passengers and
crew  were dead or missing and 
others more or less seriously injured the
heaviest casualties were among the rocket
crew and officers some of whom were
fatally burned by premature atomic dis-
charge rocket jets were set roaring at full
capacity in a vain effort to break the trans-
port away from the deadly vicinity of the
circling asteroid surviving crew members
labored heroically to load and launch the
life-rocket-boats from three airlocks two
which were so badly jammed as to be almost
unworkable

  the forward compartments were a scene
from an inferno krane who had been
with nalson in the chartroom when the crash
occurred picked himself out of the jumble
of broken lockers and scattered metal-leaf

charts and crawled through the glare and
heat to a pitiable huddle of pulped flesh
pinned beneath the wreckage of a berylium
table nalsons skull was fractured blood
pumped from his ears and he was gasping
out his life as krane pried the table away
his eyes seemed to be bursting from his
head

  no excuse for wreck he got out im
security police-sent me in case you
fumbled watch harriman-hamlin

  a spurt of blood from his mouth and
nose stopped his words he spat savagely
think    hamlins  the man you
want his lips continued to movs weakly
then hung open as he died

using a leg of the ruined table as a
wrecking bar krane pried open the
door and got into the passageway a blast
of sickening heat rushed to meet him for-
ward was a lurid glare of white hot metal
and he could hear air shrieking through the
leaks where seams had started he fought

his way aft to a bank of elevators but

they were hopelessly jammed

  descending the spiral staircase he en-
countered paul hall

  i thought you were a goner hall said
the entire forward of the ship seems to
be carried away

  it is im hard to kill nalsons dead
and so are the men in the control room
a kind of exhilaration moved in krane
the endless watching and waiting under
constant surveillance had gotten on his
nerves he was not used to intrigue now
that a need for his kind of action had arisen
he felt better already

  halls left arm had a compound fracture
above and below the elbow it hung at his
side with splinters of bone thrusting through
mangled skin and flesh krane broke open
a locker and gave him emergency first aid
binding the limb with metal splints

   thatll hold it till you can get it cared
for youd better get to the lifeboats im
going to find my wife as i told you she
might be in this racket but i cant be
sure in any case shes my responsibility
cant i help hall asked

  not now if i make it well discuss it
there if not you can relay a message for me
theres an isp squadron  hours behind us
get a helioflash to them telling them to
come a-running ive an idea theyll find
something interesting

  ill get word to them hall promised
take care of yourself boy the door of
stateroom no  was still locked and
sealed krane opened a locker and got out
a wrench to open the lugs on the hinges a
voice from behind jarred him

  ive been looking for you hamlin
sneered i thought youd be up to some-
thing in the dimming and flaring light
krane got a glimpse of the blaster in
hamlins hand kranes fingers tightened
on the wrench he spun round and hurled
the wrench in one motion hamlin pulled
the trigger but the wrench spoiled his aim
krane dodged under the beam and dragged
him down in a flying tackle the gun went
rattling down the corridor

  came away from there you fool ham-
lin screamed as he broke away dyou
want the plague he edged towards the
fallen gun but krane cut him off both
lunged for it krane got to it first but
before he could use it hamlin kicked him
page 

thrills incorporated

in the stomach he rolled on the floor in
agony hamlin kicked again viciously
krane fumbled with the gun

  a warning alarm sounded the boats
were about to leave

  krane got his breath back help me
to get her out shes no more got the plague

than you have besides shes your-

  youre mad hamlin shrieked theyd
never let her into the boats i wont risk
the lives of innocent people on your say-
so he leaned across krane to snatch at
the gun krane clawed at his face and
layers of plastic came off in his fingers
hamlin screamed as the synthetic pulled
loose from his flesh then he turned and
ran

  he darted up the companion stairs and
by the time krane could reach for the
blaster it was too late the man had
vanished to the upper gallery

  krane got to his knees and aimed the
blaster at the lock on the state-room door
the mechanism and half the door disap-
peared in a ravening violence the shock
knocked krane flat

  noni stepped through the shattered door-
way

  whats going on she wailed hysteric-
ally

  never mind that weve got to gel you
out of here are you all right she laughed
wildly of course i am has everyone
gone crazy you look a fright do you
want to carry me-or shall i carry you
get to the lower decks find the doctor
and show him youre not sick and hurry
-the lifeboats are leaving and seeing
that she hadnt moved he raged what are
you waiting for if you dont hurry it will
be too late

  she answered with a quiet assurance
listen tough guy you didnt have to come
back for me dyou think id leave you to
save my skin after that

  all right if you want to play the big
hero-have it your own way krane shook
his head to clear it of the mists of a dizzy
weakness lets get going he urged if
the lifeboats leave before we reach the air-
lock youll really be in jam

  they rushed together to the sally-port
the air-lock door was closed the boats
have gone he said he sat down hope-
lessly on a casket-like metal toolbox
maybe someone will come she said

  thats just what im afraid of he
snapped

  what do you mean thats what youre
afraid of who would come back

  dont you know

  she shook her head in bewilderment
how should i know im a stranger here
myself

  you may as well stop playing innocent
in case you dont already know im an
officer of the space patrol sent to prevent

  you act as if  knew something about
all this noni cut in i dont know why
you should think so but youre way off the
track why suspect me

  how can i help it with that picture in
your purse and that phonv martian plague
act

  i- cant explain about the picture but
the other  had nothing to do with while
you had me tied up someone came into the
room naturally  thought it was you 

was still dazed from shock and only half
awake first thing i knew a man in uni-
form had jammed a shock-cushion over
my face  thought he was trying to kill
me and nearly smothered he rubbed
something on my arms and down my neck
then left  blamed you vaguely till i re-
membered the gold braid on his sleeves
and knew it must have been a ships officer
later an officer came in with the doctor
who took one look at me and seemed scared
to death too scared to examine me they
wouldnt listen to anything just untied me
enough sos i could work loose eventually
left some stuff and locked me in thats
all  knew until you let me out just now
and now what about the photograph
whats he wanted for

  theres another one of him in the
security police headquarters hes the man
i was sent to get the original charge was
barratry but-
space pirates inc

page 

  whats barratry she asked

  its the deliberate wrecking of a ship
for the insurance or to salvage the cargo
illegally i dont know what your con-
nection with this man is-

  its very simple she said hes my
brother i knew he was in trouble but 
never dreamt it was so serious i-i wanted
to find ken and help him i thought that
if i was able to talk to him hed give him-
self up take his punishment and we could
start over again together kens all i have
left hes not bad a little wild but not
bad

  krane stood up and stared at the black
gulf of space through the visorplate he felt
a sudden bleak distaste for his profession
im afraid its a little too late for that
hes wanted for barratry murder and per-
haps treason the penalty for any one of
them is death im sorry

  far out in the void a faint cluster of
blurred needle points etched themselves
against the star patterned darkness space-
ships coming up fast under rocket power
krane glanced quickly at the wallchron it
was too soon for the space-patrol even
under full acceleration they could not make
it in less than three hours

  ill have to trust you he said grimly
brace yourself-companys coming

  noni snapped out of her black reverie
what are you going to do

  wed better work out a plan of
action working like mad krane dumped
the contents of the metal toolbox on the
floor with a spanner he smashed the hand-
operated controls which worked the air-
lock from the interior of the ship into a
tangle of twisted machinery

  get inside the toolbox he ordered
try it once to make sure you can raise
the lid from the inside then keep out of
sight when they get here ill try and
draw them away into the after part of the
ship then you slip out and get into the
airlock closing the door and locking it from
the inside if i manage to circle round
ill get back here and signal you-three
hard knocks followed by three short that
way youll have a gamblers chance

  good luck said noni softly she slid
into the toolbox while krane recharged the
blaster and stuffed his pockets with extra
ammunition

  noni raised the lid of the box slightly
it works clive she said

  take care of yourself

  he grinned one thing more when
youre in the airlock get into a space suit
and have one ready for me she nodded
and let the lid down krane rearranged the
stowage of boxes in the next compartment
into a series of defensive barricades then
crouched behind the half-open door of the
sally-port he had not long to wait

  the sally-port door swung fully open and
three rough looking men came in they
were followed by a dozen others not wearing
the heavily insulated space armour the
pirates must have run a sealed gangway
tube between the two ships and fastened it
with magnetic grapnels

  krane took careful aim and fired the
blaster into the crowd of men four were
killed by the first discharge the others
broke for cover blaster beams interlaced
and the room jarred with the repeated con-
cussion men poured through the open

door the temperature rose sharply with
the release of energy then -the pirates
rushed the door and krane was forced to
retreat to his line of barricades

  he did so cautiously firing as he went
from behind the last of his barricades he
managed to burn down three of his foes
then broke and ran for the engine room
shaft leaping across it to the spiral stair
just as he reached the upper engine loft
a beam cut down the shaft he dodged
behind a massive generator but three blaster
beams concentrated on it the force of
their triple discharge tore it from its moor-
ings artificial gravity combined with its
mass to send it crashing into a tangle of
intricate machinery below

  to avoid being crushed krane was
forced to plunge down the second shaft
then lost himself in the spider-web of inner
support beams the renegades scattered and
climbed after him in the maze of beams
page

probing with their blaster rays as shadows
moved uneasily in the eerie darkness the
lumi-bulbs waxed and waned as the un-
steady current fluctuated

  further and further krane led them
always away from the sally-port and the air-
lock darting chance beams at his pursuers
whenever the opportunity presented itself
he had the advantage of knowing that they
were all enemies their forces were divided
and confused in the weird and uncom-
fortable lofts of the engine room clear
targets were impossible

  a wild half-plan occurred to krane he
headed for the main engine room switch box
and with his beam burned out all the
fuses

   pit-like darkness enveloped the lofts as
the lumi-bulbs went out it was touch and
go sliding down the long beams in utter
darkness he reached a cat-walk and made
his way back once he collided with a
heavy body and the man swore savagely
krane gave a slight push and the man dis-
appeared over the edge of the catwalk and
fell a pulped mass on the tangle of mach-
inery below

  by a miracle he found a hatchway which
opened into the deserted passageway lead-
ing back to the room where he had erected
his hasty barricades it was occupied

   two men had been left behind as guards
he caught them unawares and burned them
down with a single sweep of his blaster
beam

  then with the butt of his blaster he
tapped out the signal on the airlock door
there was the smooth hiss of releasing
metal parts and the airlock door stood open
he slipped through and slammed the door
spinning the lock-bolts tight

  thank god you made it noni said
pale and shaken she handed him the heavy
space armour krane slipped into his helmet
and then adjusted their microphones and
space communicators

   i shut the outside door she complained
i even bolted it but it wont stay locked

  its automatic he told her when
the air-pressure is equal on both sides it
opens ill show you

   just as he reached for the controls the
door opened with a crash hamlin stood
framed in the doorway blaster in hand

  i hadnt counted on you krane he

said the gun didnt waver dont reach
for that gun

krane relaxed and stared at his
opponent he looked quite different
without the plastic face mark    somehow
older than he looked in his photographs
but noticeably the same man despite the
lines of strain which did not show in either
picture

  hamlin smiled wolfishly my pictures
dont flatter me do they the problem is
what youve done with my men youre
becoming a nuisance krane ill have to
kill you of course but id like to know
how you managed this switch

  krane was playing for time ill make
a deal with you he said im curious to
know why you pulled that martian plague
stunt with noni

  hamlin laughed  recognised her at
once though shed changed since  last
saw her ten years is a long time when
youre kids but id seen a picture of her
since when i saw you with her i knew
you were up to something i wanted to
keep away from her till i could deal with
you the rest was easy just a little grease
and aluminium powder the doctor was

scared to hell-

  you did know me then ken noni
was staring at her brother through the space
helmets

  hamlin shot her a contemptuous look
you little fool he snapped you should
never have come here i dont know what
im going to do with you now

  noni cringed as if he had struck her
well have plenty of time for old home
week later hamlin went on now tell
me whats happened t my men krane i
havent much time to waste

  krane told him and added some of
them got weeded out on the way

  and now its your turn krane hamlin
said brutally his finger tightened on the
space pirates inc

page 

trigger noni stood looking from one to
the other a look of anguish on her face
dont do it ken she said moving in
front of krane

  stay out of this noni hamlin warned
im not kidding if you get in my way ill
kill both of you

  krane moved fast then he struck her
helmet so heavily she fell against the wall
all in the same movement he lunged at
hamlin the blaster beam raked the ceil-
ing and in that confined space concussion
was unbearable even inside the space-suits
kranes blow knocked hamlin through the
door-way and into the connecting tube
krane swung about and caught up his own
gun

  dont shoot clive noni screamed
look

  the shock of the first blaster discharge
had loosed the magnetic grapnels holding
the ships together the pirate craft began
to drift away tearing loose the end of the
tube

  hamlin was on his feet trying to fire
his blaster but the charge had burned out
and it only flickered feebly he leaped the
widening distance between the ships and
went up the side like a spider gripping
with the soles of his magnetic space boots
krane climbed round the doorway and went
up after him gun in hand

  hamlin had disappeared around the
curve of the hull by this time it was rough
dangerous work climbing around the hull
of a space-ship one slip meant a plunge
into the awesome emptiness of the void
gravity  was practically non-existent and
the grip provided by the magnetic soles
was slight and only one foot could be
moved at a time

  from the vantage point of his cover
behind a dead rocket tube hamlin waited

he knew that his time was short off across
the black gulf of space three flakes of
gleaming light resolved themselves into fast
patrol cruisers racing toward the derelict
krane had not seen them but came on
steadily determined to see his assign-
ment through hamlin waited blaster rest-
ing on the dead rocket tube waiting for a
clear shot mad with hatred he blamed
krane for the failure of his whole life and
was viciously resolved to take his enemy
with him

  the patrols had moved in close by this
time and warped alongside the crippled
astronaut men in space-suits poured out
of the airlock and guns were trained on
the rocket tube behind which hamlin was
hidden

  sick fury possessed hamlin with the
gesture of a trapped rat he rammed the
blaster up the vents of the rocket tube if
he could ignite the remaining fuel he would
blow them all to kingdom come in a roaring
atomic holocaust

  krane saw his intent and stood up to
fire his beam went wildly into the dark-
ness as he lost his balance and toppled into
space another beam whipped out from the
space-cruiser and caught hamlin full force
as he stood up to fire into the tube

   he vanished in a glittering cloud of par-
ticles dispersed instantly by their own radia-
tion

  lines with magnetic grapnels attached
snaked out from the space-cruiser and
snatched krane reeling him back like a
grotesque fish for three long days he lay
unconscious from space-shock   

   back on the moon at lunar station three
people were waiting for the martian express
to take off clive krane had just said his
good-byes to noni and paul he walked up
the gangplank of the big transport and
turned to wave to them

  noni looked at paul yknow i really
cant let him go i might have a chance
to win him but how can i if hes on mars
and im here

  im afraid thats out of your hands
clive doesnt know it but hes not through
with the space patrol they refused his
resignation and hes been made commander
of the mars-jupiter section do you think
you have the guts to be a space-mans wife

   she reached the gangplank just in time to
grab it and be dragged up with it
the captain of the ship crumpled to the deck    quickly franz
went to the control room and set i he ship on a steady coarse    he
only had a few moments to complete his calculations before the
heat overcame him

even a thousand years of commerce
between earth venus and mars had
not been long enough for the spaceways to
be safe for the peaceful rocket ships that
blasted their atomic way through space in
search of trade that was all the reason
necessary to explain the presence of patrol
ship plx  in sector eight of the space-
way between earth and mars

  at the controls in the forward cabin sat
captain max gaul tall blonde trim of
figure and tough as hard training could
make him in the other heavily cushioned

seat sat his co-pilot terry cleo who ranked
as a lieutenant terry was a short red-
headed fellow with more beef than brawn
if one judged by his appearance but that
didnt pay where jerry was concerned and
a wise person took note of his red hair and
didnt rub him the wrong way

  back aft in the variable look-out naviga-
tion room sat franz hertz who also rated as
a lieutenant in the earthling patrol squad-
rons bullet-headed with clipped hair and
deep-seeming brown eyes he had the coldly
intellectual look that seemed to go with his
draught

        they were nearing the dawn of civilisation on
  a quest to find where the world was forged-could
   they withstand the dreadful power of creation

ever-ready figures on space-drift star-sights
and new courses his automatic calculators
never seemed to be still with the incessanl
complicated problems of space navigation
he fed into them

  these three rated as tops as a team in
the earthling squadrons and now they were
in sector eight because of the mysterious
disappearance of several trade ships in this
part of space their automatic observers
were continually flashing new information
on to the screen in front of the pilot but
there was never a sign of anything
remotely like a space-raider the haunting
pirates of space who plundered cargoes and
resold them secretly at enormous profits

  after three weeks and with nothing
better to do now franz was busy writing
up a detailed log of the ships activities for
the day he was able to put in a lot more
than could come through the automatic
recorder which transmitted information
automatically back to headquarters as any-
thing was said aboard ship

  this recording device had many dis-
advantages and the chief among them was
that it didnt pay to blaspheme against the
top-rank officers of the squadron while
aboard ship for it was recorded in the log
and could be read by any officer at leisure

  on the other hand as a fighting ship the
plx  was so equipped that immediately
action was engaged against a space raider
full information was being flashed back
automatically to headquarters who were
thus kept fully alerted to the situation

  suspicious sight three degrees off the
port stern snapped captain max gaul
quietly get a sight on it franz

  already have max came the quiet re-
tort from the navigator could be an
extremely large space ship or a comet gone
crazy

  that was the decision of the keen-eyed
hertz and so gaul checked position and

changed course to bring him up closer to
the stranger in the space soon they could
make out the enormous tail of the thing
where it flared out into space in a great
flaming tail behind the thing

  still no accurate identification hertz
snapped when they had been travelling on
full rocket power for some minutes

  im going in close snapped the cap-
lain quietly

  take it easy captain protested terry
excitedly as he viewed the object they were
investigating we dont want to crash that
outfit if its a sky raider its too big for
us to handle alone

  though the red-headed young fellow had
an almighty temper at times he also carried
a great streak of caution in him and this
was one time that he had a hunch they
ought to be heading the other way he said
so and the captain laughed at him max
wasnt the least bit impressed by hunches-
especially when they were jerrys but he
had to admit when he thought about it that
jerry wasnt very often wrong on such
occasions he decided to pull away im-
mediately

  take your photographs immediately im
pulling out now we can wave the prints
back to headquarters and get an expert
identification from there

  his hand swung back on the controls and
the ship shuddered desperately and then
terry was crying out anxiously

  get out of this were being trapped
in get us out of here

  but doing a heap of yelling didnt help
matters much and the ship was drawn more
and more rapidly toward the tail of the
thing as they got closer they realised that
it was a comet gone crazy off its course
and they were being rushed headlong for the
perimeter of the flaming tail of it

  were caught in a sort of draught con-
cluded the captain anxiously almost as
if we were flying in an atmosphere and ran
page

into a heavy-laden atomic blow-hole in the
air

  space draught ive never heard of a
draught in space before protested hertz
calmly

  thats my theory snapped the cap-
tain with conviction its not a gravita-
tional pull because were not heading for
the area of greatest mass but toward the
perimeter of the flaming tail

  what does it matter demanded terry
dismally i told you we should have pulled
out earlier

  naturally growled max sombrely
terry is always right after were in
trouble

  but that sort of banter didnt improve
their moods any as they were hurtled faster
and faster toward the comets tail then
with a sudden splash of colour they were
into the centre of the tail and here their
ship was locked despite the full power of
their atomic tubes

  might as well cut power drawled max
sombrely were stuck here and we cant
get out

  and for a whole day they were careened
through space in the space draught that
followed the rocket and though they didnt
know it their ship and themselves were
being subjected to a bombardment that was
to finally send them off on another track
which was apt to be a lot less to their liking
than their present precarious position

  from the comets influence they began to
emerge slowly and it was with a horrible
shock of nightmarish unreality that they
observed themselves in relation to other
things again things looked smaller were
smaller by comparison with themselves
they were increasing in size everything
was being affected by some strange whim of
the comet a billion-million to one chance
was coming off some force was working
on them

  were bigger gasped terry as he
stared out at the space beyond their ship
where it had once been a tremendous void
it now seemed to be closing in around them
and their ship was huge compared with the
moon and they guessed that by now their
mass was approaching that of earth

  im gone crazy terry blurted
anxiously i must be

  then we all have franz replied
quietly his every sense alert as he tried to

detect some change in himself he could
not he still looked and felt the same as
ever but most assuredly they were growing
larger every moment it was incredible at
what a fantastic rate they were growing it
was as if their cells and all the cells of the
whole ship were growing out and out

  if we were in a space draught before
what is this called franz hertz anxious
for a name for this phenomena so that he
could make his log records

   guess were still in some sort of a space
draught decided the captain sooner
or later well be thrown out of it and well
be back to normal again

  thats plain guessing terry snapped
angrily ive got a hunch this isnt a
passing phase

  dont tell me you think we can keep
on enlarging indefinitely snapped hertz
incredulously

  why not demanded terry eagerly
if we can enlarge at all in this space
draught why cant we be stuck in it for
good and go on enlarging

  because theres got to be a limit some-
where hertz snapped

  dont believe it max laughed theres
no end-no beginning

  but as they gazed out they saw mars
brush past them like a bettle against a
huge rock and franz recorded all the data
he could collect but there wasnt a limit
yet they burst suddenly through what
seemed to be a wall in space and found
themselves tiny beside the monsters that
abounded around them

  weve broken through the limits of the
universe we know gasped terry it   
it wasnt anything but an atom in this   
whatever it is

  very interesting murmured franz
quietly as he observed the surroundings
from his observation window a new
universe a new space new worlds
take a hold of yourself franz
snapped max angrily all this is some
sort of optical illusion created by an effect
we experienced in the comets tail we
should have run into tremendous heat and
we met none that was strange enough
but this this is impossible

  i dont think so retorted hertz
quietly many scmetists have felt that
even as in the inner structure of the atom
is never reducible to its smallest quantity
space draught

page 

so the universes are never faced with a
limit it is a series of worlds within worlds
till the end of time

  cant we do something to get out of
this complained terry excitedly why
not use the rocket tubes its getting dark
outside darker and darker as we get
bigger try the rocket tubes max

   his voice was shrill and hysterical as he
saw the darkness closing in around the
ship his hand suddenly jerked out and
slammed down the ignition of the tubes
and they burst into life and in a moment
they were thrusting through what seemed
solid matter and then suddenly they were
burst into the open

  below them from which they had come
lay the dying body of a weirdly primitive
winged creature

   weve just killed that thing franz said
calmly apparently we were a part of its
structure and this enlarging process acted
like a cancer and killed it

  how can you be so calm yelled terry
angrily were getting further and further
away from the universe we know from the
world the space we know moving up and
out through bigger and bigger things and
all you do is sit back there and make
notes

   what else is there to do asked franz
quietly

   the cold logic of this caused the little
co-pilot to turn livid with rage and he
started up from his seat and made as if
to go back and have it out with the navi-
gator max laid a hand on his arm and
growled out an order harshly

  stay where yuh are were big enough
now to take a look around

  good idea came the calm agreement
from hertz

   they were on a world of some sort that
much was immediately obvious and above
them they could see the pale pink of a sky

and the spaces beyond around them were
strange growths of primitive form and here
and there a huge monster trundled away
through the squelching bog of the marshes

  in comparison to the size relations they
had known on earth their ship was now as
big as a pigeon and they were compara-
tively smaller suddenly out of the pink
of the sky a winged thing swooped down on
them and great claws fastened around the
ship as it started its rocket tubes blasting

  the atom guns max snapped the
order weve got to get clear before were
crushed

  terry his face red and his hands
trembling set his eyes on his controls and
a moment later he squeezed the trigger
gently and the winged monster that had
captured them jerked upward and released
them whirling higher and higher up
through the air away from this strange
thing that stung so fiercely

  we made it gasped max his face
white with strain that blast would have
knocked a pirate ship out of space and all
it did here was to act like the savage sting
of an insect

  purely a matter of relative size chimed
in franz in his maddeningly calm voice

  but all the time they were getting bigger
and within the space of ten minutes as
measured by the clock in the dial before
max they were as large as the winged
thing that had captured them and when
another of the same breed swept in to
attack out of the pink sky terry laughed
hysterically as he pressed his trigger and
loosed an atomic bolt that blasted the
creature from the sky

  here time was moving slowly much more
slowly than on earth and then max re-
called the terrific speeds of the particles of
an atom and knew that the larger they be-
came the slower time would move ten
minutes by the dial clock must be but a
fraction of a second on this planet

  then sweeping down out of the sky came
a flock of winged reptilian monsters and
though they wounded several they were
captured in the claws of one of them and
the reptile swung away toward an eyrie
where the ship was dumped unceremoni-
ously a outer-skin plate was damaged by
the reptile and max snapped anxiously

  well have to repair that plate im-
mediately
page

   course came franzs reply

  those monsters would destroy us in
seconds rapped oul terry anxiously
why cant we wail till were bigger
because wc may be losing part ot otu
air supply right now snapped max
angrily do as yuhrc told and obey
orders since when have i had to ask so
many questions

  this isnt the earthling space squadron
any more snapped terry heatedly this
is beyond duly ill do what  like when
 feel like it-not before

  max gaul stood up slowly andgrowled
out angrily

  youve been asking for trouble foi
quite a time now here it is

  and gaul smashed home a terrific right
hand punch that felled terry to the flooi
from where he stared up ai max with
defiant blue eyes

  next time is my turn he growled
fiercely

  get your space-suit franz snapped
max you and  arc going out to fix thai
damaged plate

  a few minutes lalcr they were through
the air-lock and walking over the rough
sticks that made up the creatures nest all
the time they were getting bigger but they
were midgets yet compared with the winged
monsters swiftly they worked keeping an
eye out for the monsters return

  they were not quite finished when they
sighted them first and they worked on
desperately as the creatures swooped in to
land by this time they were nearly as large
as the things themselves and both men
snatched up sticks from the nest to defend
themselves but the atomic blast from the
ship told them that terry was at his post
and the first creature was blasted from the
sky

  then with the damaged plate in the hull
of their ship repaired franz hertz and
max gaul returned through the air-lock to
the interior of their ship terry was sitting
nervously by the controls of the atomic guns
and watching anxiously through the sights
i got them he cried eagerly when he
saw the boys had returned

  i guess you did max agreed quietly
were big enough now to look around

  at the controls he soon had the ship
swirling up into the pink of the atmosphere
and as he went higher he glanced anxiously

at the temperature gauge and made an ad-
justment to the refrigerant dial it was
getting hotter as they grew larger terry
was mopping his forehead with a handker-
chief and glancing doubtfully about the ship
in his cabin aft franz hertz was quietly
making observations from his window and
 hen jotting notes in his log

   the planet was alive with primitive forms
of reptilian life and a few enormous crea-
tures moved through the bogs in search of
food then they were circling into the
pink of space and franz was talking through
the inter-com equipment

   it all fits he said triumphantly the
larger we get the more primitive are the
forms of life that tics with the fact that
things move more slowly here-time itself
is slower so that creatures of this universe
havent had the same time to develop as
have wc in ours

  dont talk about ours shouted terry
angrily well never get back theres
nothing ahead but this endless growth
getting bigger and bigger nothing
nothing ahead

   pull yourself together terry snapped
max severely

  ill do as i please he snarled back
viciously im sick of you bossing every-
thing ill do as i please its too hot to
do anything anyway he added desperately
as he removed his shirt leaving himself
bared to the waist max watched him
closely but said nothing more

  then they were expanding out through
the pink of this space and the enlarged size
of their ship was brushing planets aside
from their courses till it seemed the ship
filled the whole of the hot space of the uni-
verse through which they were moving

   its getting hotter all the time exulted
franz quietly

   whats in that to be glad about yelped
terry fiercely

   cant you see cried the excited note-
taker quickly as we get bigger and
bigger we burst into and through more and
more primitive universes its getting
hotter too if we keep going well reach
the dawn of time itself the beginnings of
everything well solve the riddle that has
plagued earths men since they first began to
use words

  there was the exultant delight of the
scientific curiosity in the mans voice as he
space draught

went through and through his notes then
with the refrigerant plant working at full
blast and with the heat well-nigh unbear-
able they burst into yet another universe
and crashed into the open from a tiny
particle of steam to which they clung until
they were too large to be supported

  only then did max ignite the rocket
tubes and keep aloft by the use of their
power their rations of food were running
low now for it was three days since they
had been caught in the space draught and
that had been close to the end of their
patrol but all around them was the
steamy nothingness of cloud and no solid
matter seemed evident

  terry was back in his seat perspiring
freely and his tongue kept licking at his lips
nervously as he stared out into the steamy
cloud suddenly he was up and tearing at
max in an effort to drag him from his scat
max fought his way up and they locked
together in a struggling embrace with terry
cursing hysterically crying out that ho
wanted to go back

  desperately they fought back and forth
till max slammed terry to the deck of the
cabin on the floor terry jerked his knife
from his belt and came to his feet slowly
murder gleaming in his eyes more surely
than max had ever seen it in friend or foe

  its all your fault he screamed sud-
denly i warned you to keep clear of that
comet

  then he lept in with his knife upraised
max caught the wrist of the hand and
wrestled with his co-pilot neither man was
prepared to give quarter now for max was
well aware that the knife would sink deep
between his ribs if he gave the red-headed
madman half a chance from the navi-
gators cabin franz hertz called asking
what was the trouble but paying no further
heed of them when he got no answer he
was busy still making his notes and smiling
delightedly as he worked out more and more
of the scheme that lay behind the universes
-the worlds within worlds

  im going to kill you max cried terry
furiously its all your fault all of it

  dont be a crazy fool yelped max as
he fought terry off once more youre
letting the heat get you

  heat laughed terry harshly what
do i care bout heat im going nowhere
heading for nothing ask franz hell tell

you the dawn of everything where it
all began ask franz

  the last words were rung out in an
hysterical burst of sound and then he dived
for max again and this time max caught a
good hold of the knife-wrist and slowly
forced the pressure home hard so that the
lingers gradually released the knife and max
got his foot over it

  for a while they fought back and forlh
until terry was flung off once more defty
max stooped low and swooped up the knife
that terry had armed himself with then
with terry crouching back the captain of
the ship wiped some of the perspiration
away from where it ran from his brows into
his eyes

  sit down and dont be such a traitor
snarled max angrily his temper frayed till
his nerves were at snapping point

  all the while they had fought they were
being whirled in great sweeping circles
through the steamy nothingness and once
they darted from the cloud for a moment
and saw there was still light

  max went to turn towards his scat once
more when terry yelled his vicious de-
mented hate and flung himself on the cap-
tain again this time the knife swept up
under them in maxs hand and his powerful
arm drove the blade home between the ribs
piercing the co-pilots heart dumbly max
staggered back from the falling body and
went to franz hertz and muttered brokenly

   ive just killed terry

  naturally he was to be the first to go
stated franz quietly ive been expecting
it ever since we were heading for this uni-
verse ill note it in the log then he
turned toward his book sonce more

  what sort of inhuman devil are you
cried max desperately

  inhuman me gasped franz in sur-
prise why ive been exhibiting the most
basic trait of all humanity he cried

  isnt it basic to want to know-to be
curious isnt it human to want to be the
first to do something before anyone else
all these things ive been giving full rein

 havent had time to worry about the heat
or the end of it all

  youre coldbloodedly inhuman
growled max and swung away from the
navigator as he worked on his notes taking
observations with his instruments every
once in a while
page 

thrills incorporated

  the next universe after this will be the
purity of space leading to the dawn-the
dawn of everything cried franz as they
got through the cloudy swathes of steamy
cloud and were clear of the most terrible
of the heat and living in a warm yellow
light

  who gives a damn snapped max
angrily

  come man- see it my way come and
look at my diagrams its beautiful in its
symmetry from nothing to nothing an
endless eternity of fulfilment rambled
franz

  shut up snarled max angrily peeling
off his shirt as terry had done some time
before im sick of your theories and your
stupid scientific gusto id trade all my
knowledge just to be back with the green
hills of earth around me again

  trade this for a few hills cried hert
dramatically why man to be the first
to know all think think of the glory
of it supreme knowledge the beginning
and the end

  a wild rage swept over the captain ot
the ship and he leapt from his seat and
swung an angry punch at hertz franz
ducked swiftly under the blow and parried
with a long left that stabbed into maxs
face with the damaging effect of a spanner
blow but it only served to make max a
lot more angry than hed been and he
closed with hertz and the knife hed used
on terry slipped into his hand with a
stealthy movement

  when he tried to use it however he
found that franz was well aware of his
intention and was not in a possible position
for the stroke so the captain his face
slitted with an animal keen savage smile
slugged the navigator hard with a right and
followed with a left but found that his
second blow crashed his knuckles hard
against the inner shell of the craft

  maybe that will teach you sense sug-
gested hertz laconically

  but it didnt the heat the weirdness of
their experience and the terrible strain of
being in charge of the ship had gradually
worn down gaul until there was nothing he
could run on nothing he could keep going
on but his own emotions and franz was
the only object on which they could be
thrown hatred came easy and so now
max found he hated his navigator more

fiercely than he had ever before hated the
screw or the earthling space squadron he
hated with the blind unreasonable hate of a
man so placed that unless he has an enemy
he will die some men cant stand it when
here is nothing they can do about a situa-
tion and max gaul was such a one

  so he only plunged back to the attack
with a more fierce recklessness than before
his knife had made rips and thrusts but
franz was cleverly avoiding them till
suddenly he whipped out a hand and caught
the knife-wrist with his other hand he
brought across a short length of metal ruler
and slammed it down hard across the
knuckles of the hand that held the knife
the blade dropped to the floor from where
franz retrieved it swiftly

  now he announced still in his usual
calm voice well see how you like it

  and immediately he was attacking swiftly
with the knife and changing it from hand to
hand as occasion arose within three or
four minutes he had plunged it home to the
hilt into maxs side the captain of the
ship crumpled to the deck of the ship and
franz dropped the knife beside him

  quickly he went to the control room and
set the ship on a steady course and left her
then to care for herself while he returned
to his observations his calculations and his
excited dreaming

  somewhere he knew things stopped
getting bigger and there it was that the
dawn had been there it was that tire first
part of energy changed to a particle of
matter and that was where the ship was
heading heading for the dawn

  all around him the metal of the ship was
burning hot and the perspiration swelled
from franz in great streams but he would
not relinquish his position by the window
for as he caught sight of that splendid
golden glow he knew that soon he would
know all

  soon if only the torturing heat would
leave him be if only he couldnt smell the
harsh odor of cooking flesh where the hot
and buckled deck-plates acted like a
griller on the fallen men but there are a
lot of ifs between nothing and nothing and
franz hertz tumbled from his position by
the window and joined his sizzling com-
panions on the floor as he still clutched his
book of notes firmly in his hand

  intelligent interference

the president of planet prospectors lim-
ited gave a slight shrug and looked
down the long table at the assembly of direc-
tors personally gentlemen he said i
regard the occurrences as merely coincid-
ental although of course very unfortunate
hazards exist in space and will continue
to exist until the end of time we have
learnt a great deal during the past century
and thanks to the pioneers who probe far-
ther and farther into the depths of the
universe we have amassed a great deal of
knowledge which has helped us to allow
for and overcome most dangers of space-
travel magnetic bombardment has no ter-
rors for us we can deflect meteorites auto-
matically and even the influence of ultra-
gravitational bodies can be countered the
president paused and there was a general
nodding of heads

  the fact he went on that we have

lost two cargoes of radioactive material
worth hundreds of thousands of pounds
during the past two months is a serious
matter and perhaps it is natural for some
of us to assume that it is more than a for-
tuitous occurrence he coughed slightly
and glanced at one of the two youngest
shareholders present ken grayfield

  do you consider mr president said
ken that there is any connection between
the missing cargocraft and the spaceliner
that disappeared three months ago

  over the years there has been a steady
loss of spacecraft of all sorts replied the
president ambiguously he tapped the sheaf
of notes on the table before him the
figures here go back ten years and they
speak for themselves

  i agree said the young man theres
been no craft lost for more than two years
and in quick succession we lose a spac-
finer and two cargocraft

kens finger was closing on the trigger
as the nogaeinan raised his arm   
there was a blinding flash   
page 

thrills incorporated

  im with him mr president said
jimmy briscoe kens co-pilot and friend
there is a connection between the disap-
pearance of the three craft

  you and your friend are suggesting that
there has been intelligent interference to
the craft said the president raising his
brows at the plump jimmy

  well-er-i didnt say that replied
jimmy self-consciously but its a possi-
bility what do you think ken

  all eyes were turned towards ken gray-
field the young man had earned an envi-
able reputation as a spaceflyer and it was
his and jimmys efforts that had lifted
planet prospectors limited to its present
position of wealth and power and incident-
ally given them seats on the board and
made the two young men enormously
wealthy overnight they had discovered a
fabulously rich asteroid composed almost
entirely of radio active mineral and taken
possession of it in the name of planet pros-
pectors with the result that the company
now had a virtually inexhaustible supply of
atomfuel but although no longer necessary
for the two young spacefliers to tramp
through space prospecting for minerals they
could not remain inactive and they had
made several adventurous spacetrips in their
little luxury spacecruiser it was natural
then that the young spacefliers opinions on
actual cosmic possibliities should be awaited
with interest by the stay-at-home members
of the board

   i think it is a decided probability said
ken slowly i think that there may have
been some interference from a human
agency or by some form of life similar to
humanity

  pirates eh one of the elder members
threw out the suggestion accompanied by a
laugh a laugh which was taken up by the
others

  come mr grayfield said the presid-
ent smiling we all admit your skill and
experience but your suggestion is rather-
ah-startling how could a craft be board-
ed in outer space without the co-operation
of its crew and even if that co-operation
existed would it not be necessary for the-
ah-piratical vessel to have identical air-
locks with those of the victim finally mr
grayfield you will concede that successful
operations of missiles through outer space
is extremely problematical i mention that
in case you are about to suggest that the

vessels were bombarded by hostile craft
lots of things problematical to us could
be practicable to a more advanced tech-
nology-say on another planet said ken

  our regular routes have been mapped
mr grayfield every body in space of any
magnitude is on the astromap

  i have offered a possible explanation
said ken nettled by the presidents rather
condescending tone i now await your
alternate explanation

   it was the presidents turn to look embar-
rassed while the weathercock members
smiled at his discomfiture

   it is easy to theorise mr grayfield he
snapped i have a theory myself but as it is
merely a private theory i hesitated to put it
forward here until i had learned more since
you have asked for it i shall give it he
eyed the members who were now leaning
forward expectantly i am of the opinion
that our last cargocraft collided with that
mysterious intermittent comet which was re-
ported by the passengers and crew of a
spaceliner a few weeks ago

  a ten billion-to-one chance mr presid-
ent but all the argument sitting around at a
murmured agreement

  very well said the president i have
ventured a theory just as mr grayfield has
 what do you think mr grayfield
ken rose its a possibility mr presid-
ent but all the argument sitting around at a
table wont make any difference unless we
decide to do something     he stopped
as a little buzz sounded at the head of the
table and at the same time the visiscreen
set in front of the president glowed the
voice from the screen was muted and for
the presidents ear alone he received the
message murmured acknowledgment and
deadened the screen

  gentlemen the president rose to his
feet and tapped his gavel i have an an-
nouncement to make news has just been
received at control room that scs  has
been lost

  the third cargocraft said ken he
looked at the president and you still
think its a coincidence

  one moment mr grayfield rebuked
the president i have something to add to
that the last spaceradio call from the craft
mentioned a fiery comet i will admit that
the sender of the message the co-pilot
did not attach any significance to the comet
which was a vast distance from his craft at
devouring comet

page 

the time he merely mentioned it whilst
giving his own position in accordance with
regulations but i do attach significance to
it whether you gentlemen have changed
your minds     he waited and smiled
thinly at the doubting expressions that flitted
across the others faces

  theres one way to learn the truth mr
president said ken grayfield jimmy
and i are prepared to investigate i still
hold to my theory of intelligent interference
and therefore i shall require the use of one
of our cargacraft as a decoy

  that is a matter for the board

  one of the members moved that a cargo-
craft be placed at the disposal of the two
young spacefliers a move that was carried
unanimously

  i think your theory is wideof the mark
mr grayfield said the president but
knowing you and your friend here im
sure you will remain out in space until you
discover something he held out his hand
i wish you both luck

      the comet appears
izen grayfield at the controls of
-iv the spacecraft looked intently into the
visiscreen and then at the astromap his
co-pilot was staring through the plastic
windows out into the blackness of space the
dead absolute blackness not intended for
the eyes of an earthdweller

  this is roughly the vicinity from where
the last spaceradio call came from space-
cargo craft  said ken bringing the craft
around in a wide sweep not that that
means much it may not have struck
trouble for an hour or so later and an
hour to a spacecraft means a lot of miles
in space

  jimmy briscoe nodded glumly if we
had any idea of its direction we could make
that way but as it is its no use getting off
the regular track-that if if your argument

is correct if theres some sort of controlled
craft manned by a being from another
planet then its sure to be prowling about
on the regular run looking for victims

   i still think im right said ken dog-
gedly three ships one after another
cant disappear without trace without a logi-
cal reason and im sure that each one has
been lost through the same agency

  and what about the presidents fiery
comet theory

  i cant swallow that retorted ken
there would be about as much chance of
that happening as there would be for a ten-
nis ball floating in the atlantic striking a-
a canoe and if the countless billions-to-one
chance did come off it wouldnt occur three
times we can dismiss the fiery comet from
our calculations jimmy

   both he and jimmy turned their attention
to the visiscreen in which floated tiny images
of planets and asteroids like marbles the
asteroids and planetoids little larger than
pinheads and one planet jupiter showing
against the black background like a glowing
pearl and as they looked at the screen a
tiny pinpoint of white with a tail of red no
larger thana hairs breadth in thickness ap-
peared on the extreme left-hand corner and
slowly crept across the face of the screen

   a comet said jimmy his voice animat-
ed strange we should scan one just now
ken nodded and craned closer to the
screen the comet was behaving in a curi-
ous fashion usually such a body moved
across the screen and was seen no more its
speed depending upon its distance from the
scanning craft but this comet after appear-
ing on the screen then disappearing sud-
denly returned and its second appearance
indicated that it was now much closer to
the craft

  i say jimmy was now frankly excitcd
thats something new to me ken ive
never seen a comet with an orbit like that
before look its in the screen all the
time now and its coming closer

  although still not visible to the naked
eye the comet was clearly defined now on
the screen a glittering silver ball with a
blood-red fiery tail sweeping out behind it as
it swept across the black sky in an erratic
elliptical orbit the two young spacemen
watched the extraordinary sight fascinated
comets on the mars-jupiter run were un-
usual although not rare but never before
had they been treated to such a display of
page 

thrills incorporated

cosmic fireworks at best their previous
views of these hurtling heavenly bodies had
been little more than mere glimpses and
jimmy was hastily scribbling the account in
the log book at the same time watching the
screen

  jimmy it was ken who was now ex-
ciicd its coming straight towards us

  the comet had indeed ceased its appar-
ently aimless gyrations and instead was
fixed in the centre of the screen its tail only
faintly visible as a glow in the rear of the
shining silver ball which was growing larger
and larger every instant ken turned the
craft to port and the comet swung off the
screen but a moment later it was back
again larger than ever

  great scot it-it almost looks as though
the thing was being attracted to us said
jimmy in alarm

  kens answer was to swing away to star-
board again the comet swept across the
screen and disappeared and again it re-
turned exactly to the centre of the screen-
and again it was larger

   its coming towards us at terrific speed
panted jimmy were definitely attracting
the thing ken the old president was right
after all

  looks like it said ken between his
teeth but i still cant understand it a
little ship like this attracting a comet through
thousands and thousands of miles of space
it doesnt make sense

  the fiery comet was almost the full size
of the screen its tail causing a red back-
ground for it in place of the normal black-
ness of the screen jimmy wrenching his
gaze from the screen peered out through
the glastic nose of the craft he caught his
breath sharply as he saw directly ahead the
tiny silver ball with its fiery red aura and
then it disappeared as ken swung the craft
around in a wide sweep and headed back
the way they had come

  keep an eye out to the rear jimmy he
rapped out were moving away from
here if that thing collides with us the mys-
tery of those missing craft will never be
solved

  jimmy pulled himself along the interior
of the craft gripping the handrails and float-
ing weightless as he was out there in space
to the rear of the machine he expected
when he looked through the glastic rear
window to see the comet as a dwindling
speck instead his startled eyes beheld the

comet sweeping after them and gaining
every second

  step her up ken he called back its
catching up

  get into a shock brace called the pilot
at the same time releasing one of the spider-
web-like members from the ceiling he slip-
ped his arms and legs through the holes in
the apparatus and after satisfying himself
that his friend was likewise protected against
the tremendous acceleration which was now
about to take place he operated the major
converter the spacecraft leapt forward the
web-like brace straining to its limits and the
pilot feeling as though a heavy weight was
pressing against his chest a pressure that
seemed about to flatten his ribs against his
spine the plump jimmy on the other hand
was experiencing sensations exactly opposite
to those of his friend he was facing the tail
of the craft and the pressure was on his
back and he was suffering intense spine-
cracking agony

  fortunately the sensation was moment-
ary and when he opened his eyes again
which he had involuntarily screwed up with
pain he saw that the fiery comet was
dwindling

  weve beaten it ken he roared jubi-
lantly its dropping away

  good breathed the other i want to
circle it if i can im curious to learn some-
thing more of that mysterious comet if 
slacken down-

  dont slacken shouted jimmy in alarm
its catching up again it-its coming up
as though were standing still

  ken turned a startled face and looked
along the length of the little spacecraft
there was no doubt about it the comet
was hurtling towards them at a fantastic
speed the shining silver ball with its blood-
red background was almost on top of them
he pressed down the major converter to its
limit but the effect was negligible

  its on us yelled jimmy were done

     controlled comet
rphe two young spacemen braced them-
selves for the shock-for the collision
that would shatter their craft to fragments
send their bodies out into space to burst-
and provide yet another problem for the
puzzled people of earth but the shock did
not come instead they had a glimpse of
the comet shooting past them a matter of
less than half a mile away its enormous tail
devouring comet

page 

filling the interior of the little craft with a
bright red glow

  well gulped jimmy sweat starting from
his forehead thats as close as  ever
want to be to-

  were catching up with it cut in ken
for some reason the comet had slowed down
and was now racing along level with the
craft the pilot gradually decreased the
speed and the comet moved ahead but after
a few moments its own speed decreased so
that again it was travelling at the same
speed as the spacecraft

  well ill be hanged gasped ken he
stared through the side shield at the hurtling
comet it was a comparatively tiny body its
diameter little more than a mile while its
tail so far as he could judge would be about
five miles in length but no doubt that would
extend to twice that length when travelling
at greater speeds for the rest its surface
was smooth and silvery and gave an impres-
sion of great metallic density

  whatdo you make of it demanded
jimmy returning to his side

  that tail ken was watching the comet
closely and it was nearer to their craft the

distance having been lessened to perhaps a
quarter of a mile its not just a streak of
light its an actual flame no its a series
of fires  see there theres a white-hot
mass on this side and a little distance away
a hundred yards or so is another white-hot
mass there must be dozens-scores-of
them all adding up to one big conflagration
and giving the effect of a tail as it shoots
through space the thing must be composed
of white-hot material of some kind either
that or there is constant atomic energy being
generated in its interior but i cant puzzle
out how its apparently being attracted to
our craft he turned his attention to the
spaceradio transmitter just in case it sud-
denly swings over our way im going to send
a message through to earth spaceradio giv-
ing the details of our experience he
turned the switch waited for the transmitter
screen to glow but it remained blank and
dead

  its cut out he said that explains
why none of the missing craft sent -a mes-
sage immediately before they were lost or
destroyed this comet must possess an enor-

blanket against radio-activity in its vicinity
and it all adds up to the presidents
theory said jimmy youre satisfied that
he was right now

   looks like it  im going to try to get
out of its range and send that message across
to earth itll make the president feel satis-
fied with himself at least

  ken turned the craft but almost imme-
diately the mysterious comet turned with
them he twisted dived and climbed but the
comet as though attached to the craft by
an invisible arm faithfully kept pace with
the craft

  gosh breathed jimmy its like an
old man of the sea it wont be shaken
off   what the-somethings happening
to it ken the tail its smaller the fires
on this side have died down to nothing 
its-look look-will you the plump
young mans voice had risen to a shriek
am i going mad can you see it he
grasped ken grayfield by the shoulder qnd
stared open-mouthed through the glastic
side-port ken no less shocked was look-
ing with unbelieving eyes at the comet

  not only had the tail dwindled by reason
of a cessation of the fiery activity on the
side nearest them but low down in the great
globe a black line had appeared about a
hundred yards in length and running later-
ally along the comet the line was at firt
thin but gradually it widened so that it
had all the appearance of a great mouth
opening in a dead silvery face

  so intent were the two young spacemen
on this extraordinary phenomenon that they
failed to notice another and a more ominous
development it was ken who discovered
the fresh danger and he reacted by turning
back to the controls

  its coming over to us jimmy he said
and theres no doubt that its being con-
trolled from somewhere he attempted to
alter the course of the spacecraft but the
vessel failed to respond it was as though
the craft were no longer the responsive
machine it was but rather a dead thing
drifting in space its dead he called i
cant do a thing with it the instruments
are useless

  the comet was only a matter of yards
away the silver sheen of the thing was
dazzling to the eyes of the two men and
then the brightness was blacked out for

the enormous mouth-like black slit was level
with the craft

  its an opening into the comet shouted
jimmy

  and were being drawn into it replied
ken and at the same instant the little
craft gave a violent lurch in the direction
of the comet jimmy was flung against the
foamrubber of the far wall ken sprawled
back in his seat the craft pitched quivered
or a moment and then was still

inside the fiery comet

the two young men picked themselves
up and looked about them the lights
in the spacecraft were still burning but the
craft seemed to be resting on solid ground
ken moved to the glastic nose peered ot
but ahead was a dense blackness not uie
accustomed blackness of space dotted with
tiny pinpoints of light but the darkness of
a heavy curtain-a dense dead pall

   well were still alive after our collision
muttered jimmy and the ship is intact
but thats about all i can gather

   it wasnt exactly a collision said ken
were obviously inside that comet the
black slit in its side was a sort of doorway
which was opened to receive us and our
craft was attracted inside by some means
but whats behind it all beats me com-
pletely we might as well be dead and
buried inside the comet

  jimmy shuddered there isnt a sound
either he said uneasily its like a con-
founded grave  do you think we ought
to try getting out ken

  ken looked doubtful for a moment i
dont feel like opening the air-lock jimmy
goodness knows what sort of an atmos-
phere exists outside-or rather inside this
thing well make a test first at least and
then if necessary we can put on ou space-
suits and do a bit of exploring i know now
by the way that i was right in my theory
and that the president was right too the
fiery comet is the answer to those missing
spacecraft and the fiery comet is controlled
by some intelligence

  you think there are others in this
comet asked jimmy or do you think
its remotely controlled from another planet
-i mean it could be automatically actu-
ated by the presence of metallic craft which
it could gobble up like it has us and then
transport the catch back to some distant
planet
devouring comet

page 

  it was a question that was answered im-
mediately and surprisingly the blackness
outside was dispelled suddenly by brilliant
light and the two startled young men found
themselves looking out into a huge chamber
one wall was slightly concave indicating
the outer casing of the comet and along
this wall was a series of vertical furrows
and one long horizontal ridge of gleaming
metal above the vertical furrows were
several huge cylinders and pistons descen-
ded from them to the horizontal ridge

  thats the door and its mechanism
said ken quickly and look jimmy
straight ahead our missing cargocraft-
the last one

  gosh jimmy stared it was a cargocraft
similar to their own and the lettering
scs  was boldly visible on its side
where arc the others i wonder

  probably dumped out in space replied
ken grimly to make room for us and
any other craft that comes within range

  they moved to the other side of their
craft and peered out and saw that a door
was sliding up silently in the inner wall re-
vealing a brilliantly illuminated room in
the doorway a figure appeared it was a
human figure but its height was more than
seven feet the lace of the man was smooth
the skull entirely devoid of hair there were
minute eyelashes on the lids covering the
deep set eyes but no eyebrows he was
dressed in brief shorts and an almost skin-
tight shirt both of a glossy brilliant red
material the scantiness of his attire re-
vealed the prefect proportions of his great
body and the smoothness of his skin which
had in it a faint yellow tint

  he stepped from the doorway followed
by another being only slightly less in stat-
ure and similarly clad under the won-
dering eyes of the two earthmen the tall
beings walked around the craft eyeing it

with apparent approval then the taller man
walked over rapped on the glastic panel
on the port side and made signs to the
earthmen to open the airlock

  what do you think ken asked jimmy
atmosphere must be ok theyre human
even if they are a bit oversize

  weve got no choicc replied ken im
keen to get out and find out what  can
about this mystery comet but im not going
without an atoblaster open up while i
slip one in my pocket

  unobtrusively he pocketed the weapon
as his plump friend released the air lock
and then the two men stepped from their
craft to confront the huge residents of the
fiery comet

   tan rokas plan
reetngs and welcome to our
craft said the taller man in perfect
english and observing the astonished
looks of the two earthmen he added with
a smile you are not the first guests we
have entertained over the past few months
as calculated by your earth-time we have
had many visitors from them we have
learned the language which is now almost
universally used on earth we have learned
also many things about your planet-a
most desirable planet it seems he glanced
at the other man as he spoke and the two
smiled meaningly

  youve certainly staggered me said
ken to hear you speak our language as
though it is your own-

  you do not surprise me put in the
man already we know that learning to you
people of earth is a long and tedious pro-
cess to us of nogae whose culture is
thousands of years in advance of your own
learning is a swift and simple matter you
earth folk require time in order to become
habituated to new skills with us that tedious
and time-wasting process is unnecessary
we learn instantaneously

  that explains it to some extent said
ken but you speak of nogae

  it is the second planet in what you
would call our solar system replied the
man conditions there correspond to those
of the third planet of your system atmos-
pheric pressure and gravity is almost identi-
cal

  gravity it was jimmy who interrupted
i say there is gravity here-out in spacc
page 

   artificially created gravity said the tall
man it exists only within this craft and
mekes this more comfortable for us that
is important for we must live in our craft
all the time

  and this is a craft breathed ken it
-its a colossal achievement its more
than a mile in diameter

  you will find many interesting things
aboard our craft while you are with us
the taller man nodded to his companion
this is gru nadar whom i can best de-
scribe to you as my deputy  am tan
roka commander of the craft

  ken responded by introducing his friend
and himself and now tan roka he said
quickly  think we are entitled to an ex-
planation no doubt your method of in-
ducing us to visit your craft was necessary
but others have paid you involuntary visits
over the past few months and they are still
your guests are they prisoners-or isnt it
possible for craft to leave here once they
are inside

  you must be patient my little friends
smiled tan roka you do not understand
the lengthy explanation required to answer
fully your questions i must first ask you a
question your craft is carrying radioactive
material is it not

  not a scrap replied ken closely
watching the expression on the giants face
and noting a sudden change in the deep-
set eyes were using a cargocraft thats
all

  he felt the eyes burning into his own
then tan roka turned to his companion
he is speaking the truth

  then we have brought them in to no
purpose said gru nadar his voice deep
and harsh send them away as we did the
others

  the commander shook his head and
spoke again this time in a soft and curiously
liquid language gru nadar nodded slightly
in apparent acquiescence the two earth-
men eyed their gigantic captors doubtfully
the words of gru nadar suggested that
the others had been sent away by dump-
ing them in space and the suggestion was
emphasised by the presence of that other
cargocraft

  you will stay with us for a time said
tan roka we may learn a little from you
it is possible to learn from anyone you will
learn a lot from us if your intelligence is

of a higher quality that that of the others
you may be permitted to remain with us
until we visit your planet

  youre going to visit the earth said
ken surprised

  tan rokas laugh was echoed by his
deputy yes my little being we are going
to visit the earth and we are going to
remain on the earth

  but what about your own planet why
have you left it

  our planet has suffered the fate reserved
for those with gret knowledge but with
unsuitable rulers said tan roka his face
darkening the planet nogae is now a
radio-active mass and will remain so for
countless millions of years the planet
earth will suffer the same fate if it is left
to work out its own destiny

  i dont understand you

  you earthmen said tan roka are
on the threshold of atomic annihilation
you are probing the mysteries of matter-
its creation and its utter destruction soon
you will use it and the result will be the
same as that which occurred on nogae it
cannot be avoided unless a superior form
of life descends upon earth and prevents
that calamity

  you mean-atomic war

  i do we of nogae although far ahead
of earth in culture and intelligence could
not prevent our own calamity i foresaw
it as did many others but i acted i de-
signed and constructed this craft which is
powered by atomic energy and when hos-
tilities broke out between the two nations
on our planet i and my followers left
from afar we saw our home planet become
a boiling mass of gaseous activity the re-
sult of the use of a process which split the
atoms of the atmosphere itself it was the
ultimate and inevitable weapon the war
was over then and there was nothing left
tan roka paused a brooding look in his
dark eyes for years according to your
time we have searched the depths of space
seeking a planet which might become our
home and fthe cradle of a civilisation
superior to any in the universe the story
of our wanderings would amaze you we
have entered countless systems but al-
though many planets will support our form
of life there are factors which make them
unsuitable we at length reached your sys-
tem and the first thing we learned about it

was that the inhabitants of the third planet
which we now know as earth had achieved
spaceflying that is not an achievement
peculiar to you earthmen but it suggested
a fairly highly developed technology our
next step was to ascertain what sort of
beings you were and if possible to learn
something of the social conditions existing
on earth to do that it was necessary to
have some of you as our guests

  thats what this trap is for then said
ken jerking his head towards the enormous
door why didnt you simply go to earth
itself

  we had reasons which will shortly be
clear to you replied the nogaeman we
knew by our instruments the nature of the
earth-its atmosphere gravity and struc-
ture but there were many little things to
learn-your history the age of your civilisa-
tion and above all your technical achieve-
ments we had also to learn your languages
english is the chief language we know but
we have learnt chinese from one of the pas-
sengers of a spaceliner-

  what happened to that spaceliner
demanded ken quickly

  it was of no use to us replied the other
we discarded it after removing its atom-
fuel for our own purpose

  and the passengers

  they were of no use to us replied
tan roka we discarded them after learn-
ing all we could from them

  why you-youre nothing but a mur-
derer exploded ken a cold-blooded
killer

  neither of the two nogaemen seemed in
the least perturbed at the young earth-
mans outburst either they kept their emot-
ions well under control or else they were
beyond such elementary feelings tan roka
continued as though ken had not spoken
you will know soon why we wished to
learn the extent of the knowledge of earth-
men but before leaving this room you

would like to learn how we persuaded your
craft to join us we shall not open the doors
on to space for the reason that we should
lose our atmosphere in this room and our
lives once the doors are closed however
the normal atmosphere is restored within
a few minutes automatically

  those pillars you see built into the inner
wall he went on with a wave of his arm
are ultra-gravitational machines which we
call x-nogaes a similar apparatus on
earth you would doubtless call x-earth as
it provides a gravitational attraction many
times more powerful than that of your
planet when actuated from the control
room your craft was drawn to the
machines just as it would be drawn to your
own planet the intense gravitational field
also rendered your spaceradio equipment
ineffectual

  that explains our helplessness in our
craft commented jimmy feelingly but it
doesnt explain why you trapped us and the
other craft

  primarily said tan roka coolly we
trapped your particular kind of craft because
we learnt that it was the type which carried
atomfuel in large quantities we had a great
initial supply but our wanderings have con-
sumed a great deal the secondary reason
i have already explained-to learn some-
thing of your kind he paused have
you not guessed our ultimate intention
kens eyes narrowed as he stared up at
the giant and before the other spoke he
realised that ultimate intention

  we said tan roka slowly and dis-
tinctly are going to take over the earth

     a desperate decision
co you imagine said ken drowning his
 friends horrified gasp that you can
take over an entire planet have you any
idea of the population of earth tan roka
there were-using your own method of
calculation replied the nogaeman seven-
teen billions on nogae the earth would
because of the stunted stature of its beings
probably hold more but there will be far
fewer beings on your planet when we take
control it will be necessary to clean out
one or more entire countries just as we have
in the past cleared certain pests from great
areas of nogae

  he turned away follow he invited
and you shall see more of our craft and
page

you shall learn that i speak truly when i say
we can and we will take over the earth
the two earthmen led by tan roka and
followed by gru nadar walked from the
big room and stood on the threshold of
the inner room and stared around unbeliev-
ingly it was not a mere room into which
they were looking it was virtually an en-
closed city but a city with a difference

   before them stretched a wide promenade
extending more than half-a-mile and from
this central promenade there were smaller
paths some leading to left and right on the
same level but others sloping gently up-
wards twisting and turning at different
levels and in turn providing more tributary
paths so that the effect from the floor level
to the mile-high dizzy levels above was that
of enormous petrified ribbons formed into a
tangled maze these higher pathways were
supported by absurdly thin and graceful pil-
lars and the pillars also provided the foun-
dations for tall and beautifully finished
buildings composed of a gleaming cream
material higher and higher ken looked
and his eyes were bewildered at the sight of
the  buildings stretching up and up into the
rdisteince collectively they made even the
modern nd century skyscrapers seem
dwarfed by comparison

    our temporary homes explained tan
roka we of nogae are individualists we
prefer to live alone and as far as possible
to work alone for we found at a certain
stage of our cultural evolution that our finest
work is produced in that way we work to-
gether only against a common enemy or on
a project which is beyond the powers of an
individual

   ken was aware of several of the gigantic
nogaemen emerging from the buildings and
looking at the two earthmen with a mixture
of curiosity and condescension just as a
man would gaze on an interesting but unin-
telligent animal the inhabitants of this
miniature world were dressed in the briefest
clothes for the temperature was delight-
fully warm but without the slightest sign of
humidity as the party moved along the
wide promenade several groups of the nog-
aemen and women were passed the latter
beautifully proportioned amazons only a
few inches shorter than the average male
and dressed in clothes similar to those of
the men although in more sombre colors
tnd like the men there was no vestige of

hair on their smooth slightly yellow skulls
which gleamed under the soft white light
from some concealed source behind translu-
cent panels in the walls

  they had walked a matter of two hun-
dred yards when tan roka turned from the
main promenade and ascended one of the
sloping paths which led towards the rear
or tail-end of the great globe he stopped
at a high door and in response to pressure
on a small white knob the door slid up
silently

  the control room he announced

  eagerly the two spacepilots moved into
the room and eyed the scene judged by
earthly standards it was an enormous
room and the first thing that arrested their
gaze was a sort of outsize visiscreen about
fifty yards in diameter on which was visible
myriads of stars planetoids and planets

  our solar system cried jimmy look
at earth why it seems no distance away
ken

  ken nodded lost in admiration at the
nmazing sight the glowing ball of the sun
with a great flaming corona was floating
serenely in the black void and around it
were grouped its satellites the earth with
its moon having the appearance of a double
planet he turned from the huge screen to
the nogaeman who seemed to be the control
officer he was sitting at a semi-circular
desk from which protruded a maze of small
identical levers there was nothing to dis-
tinguish one lever from another no in-
scribed plates but remembering what tan
roka had told him of the intellectual powers
of the nogaemen ken realised that once the
function of one of those levers was ex-
plained the knowledge was grasped and
held in the amazing brain of these super-be-
ings and the chilling thought struck him
that creatures with such capactiy as well as
the possessors of an advanced culture and
technology might well conquer the entire
earth

  this said tan roka is the heart of
our craft the levers regulate the degree of
destruction of the radio-active matter which
we use as fuel the speed of our craft is
determined by the speed at which the matter
is annihilated the direction is determined
by the jets which are in operation the
whole control is sensitive to the slightest
manipulation of the controlling levers there
are jets above and below which are rarely

used those below may be changed from
propulsion and repulsion purposes to an-
other very different and useful purpose

   the taciturn- gru nadar-perrailted -a- sis-

	ister smile -to sit across his  face -at these
-words -a -smile that -was reflected on the
face of the xoxnmsnder  ken was-cansckms
ci a dr eadi fear sot for himself but for
his fellow-creatures on earth no doubt
that the mention of the mysterious jets had
something to do with the method by which
these calculating creatures intended to sub-
due the earth but it was the less percep-
tive jimmy who asked the obvious ques-
tion	

  what useful purpose he demanded
bluntly

   you may as well know said gru nadar
harshly from the lower jets by means
of the simple operation rf one of those
levers a supersonic ray will penetrate the
atmosphere of earth and destroy human
and higher forms of animal life

  now you understand said tan roka
why we are confident that we can take
over your planet little man we can te-
main out in space and train our rays on
any given area of earth and drown your
fellow-creatures in soundless vibrations
and nothing can shield them from the
effects-nothing

   but-but its inhuman protested ken
after all we are human creatures just like
-yourselves you cant contemplate such a
mass-slaughter

   it is necessary replied tan roka we
desire a planet for our own superior race
we will permit earth-life to exist on earth
to a limited degree such life being inferior
will be engaged on inferior tasks for us
they will be fed and clothed-and will
work for us

   slavery said ken bitterly it would
be better if you wiped out the entire inhabit-
ants rather than reduce them to beasts of
burden

  perhaps agreed tan roka but we
are not considering them he gestured
towards a thick studded door there re-

-said he -noddedtothcgontcel-g-sieer-who
rnanipujalajswitch and -the iheavjly  stud-
-ded -door slid otpjvards and  hissing xoae -
strom of sound poured into the room the
two earthmen peered into the room the
iear wall of which was slightly concave
great white pipes ran from the enclosed
atomic furnaces to this concave wall and
through these pipes poured the released
energy from the furnaces

   it is quite safe said tan roka step-
ping inside everything is perfectly
shielded the atomfuel he went on indi-
cting rows of cylindrical containers is
placed in those cylinders and is fed auto-
matically to the furnaces a little at a time
of course the bulk or reserve supply of
atomfuel is contained in those larger tanks
above and that too is automatically fed to
the smaller cylinders as supply runs low
nothing is handled once the atomfuel is
placed in the reserve container

  very ingenious said ken his voice
quivered slightly as he looked at the great
tanks for tan rokas words had suggested
something to him a means by which he
might be able to destroy this little floating
world and thus save the earth from sub-
jugation he still had his atoblaster and if
it were possible to blast a hole in one of
those tanks or in a cylinder there would be
an immediate reaction of the radioactive
fuel to the disintegrating ray from the ato-
blaster and the chain reaction set up in the
masses of unstable atomfuel would result
in a cataclysmic explosion which would re-
duce the fiery comet to a mass of radioactive
gas if he could blast one hole 

 with apparent carelessness his hand
moved to his pocket and gripped the handle
of the atoblaster his finger on the switch
if he were successful it would mean the end
of everything the bodies of himself and his
friend would disintegrate but it was two
lives in the balance of the lives of millions

  and then with one swift movement he
withdrew the weapon from his pocket

    shock for gru nadar 
tt was the keen-eyed brooding gru nadar
-i who first sensed trouble he had been
watching the changing expression on the
young earthmans face for some moments

 the other nogaeman intent on his explana-
 tion of the controlling functions of the fiery
 comet-and- obviously--anafraid- of-any- action
 -which -these gigmy iearihmen couiii make

 -	was taken comp-ieteiy unawares tic turned
 swiftly as his deputys harsh voice palled in
 the nogae tongue

   ken levelled the muzzle of the atoblaster
 at the great cylinder nearest him but before
 he could press the switch gru nadar having
 uttered his cry of warning moved with in-
 credible swiftness stretched out one long
 arm and gripped the earthmans wrist like
 a crushing vice

   let go roared ken struggling violently
 but as futilely as a baby in that huge power-
 ful grip he felt the strength ebbing from
 his hand as it was crushed tighter and then
 tan roka was beside him grasping his other
 arm

   let em have it it was jimmys voice
 high pitched with excitement the plump
 young man flung himself at tan roka his
 fists lashing out the force of the blows caus-
 ing the huge nogaeman to stagger but he
 recovered raised one great hand and sent
 jimmy staggering across the room with a
 blow on the chest that almost cracked his
 ribs

   gru nadars eyes were glittering in sad-
 istic triumph as he increased the pressure on
 kens wrist and then a contemptuous smile
 curling his lips he lifted his left hand and
 gripped the young earthman by the throat
 the great fingers tightened ken felt the
 pounding of a pulse in his neck as the blood
 was dammed back under the terrible pres-
 sure in a few seconds he would lapse into
 unconsciousness and the last vestige of hope
 would vanish he felt the atoblaster slip-
 ping from his numb fingers and it was that
 movement which caused him to summon up
 his ebbing strength-that and the sneering
 maddening smile on the big face of his an-
 tagonist

   with a last violent effort he wrenched the
 atoblaster against the giants body and
 pressed the switch gru nadars face still
 wore a contemptuous triumphant smile
 when the mans body blasted from the
 middle exploded in a blinding mass of white
 heat and the next second all that was left
 of the deputy was a drifting mass of vapor

   ken felt the crushing grip of tan roka
fall from his shoulder as the comets com-
mander with a hoarse cry sprang back

from the blast and he heard another cry
this time of exultation from his friend

  hiausvjyteilimziry nowtct
-kkmhanziii

  ken swung the weapon around so thatit
covered the big nogaeman dont move
towards us tan roka he warned harshly
you saw what happened to his body

  the veneer of the nogaemans boasted
culture and civilisation had slipped from his
face and there now peered through those
deep set eyes a glare of homicidal passion it
flashed through kens mind that in the last
analysis emotions remained constant and
fundamental in the make-up of humanitiy
tan rokas attitude had previously been
that of one superior to all feeling and emo-
tion but now he was mentally back in the
jungle whence he had emerged countless
thousands of years ago

  the thought stimulated the young earth-
man he was after all dealing with a human
being a creature who was nothing more
than a would-be dictator on a grand scale
and whose primary concern just then was
his own life and ambitions

  you are foolish pigmy earthman
snarled tan roka his thin lips pulled back
from his big even teeth in an animal grimace
of rage my deputy has gone but you shall
go too i was too careless with you i
should have searched you for weapons but
i thought you were as supine and helpless
and as slow thinking as the other earthmen
we captured and destroyed

  youre going to conquer the whole
earth put in jimmy why you oversize
swollen-headed so-and-so youre not going
to conquer us  what are we going to do
with him ken reduce him to his mole-
cules

  tan roka said ken slowly i did not
intend to blast gru nadar-i intended to
puncture one of those cylinders set up a
chain re-action and blast this craft to noth-
ingness i still intend to do just that we
shall perish but the earth will be saved
the big nogaeman looked at him then a
slow smile spread across the large face
you are just foolish after all earthman
he said in coldly amused tones he stepped
to one side and motioned to the nearest
cylinder train your weapon on that and
observe the result

  ready jimmy said ken quietly

  the plump young man gulped his cheeks
devouring comet

page 

pale yes he said it-its the only
way to - to destroy this threat to human
life l-let her go

  ken nodded and pressed the switch

terms rejected

across the control room straight for its
target the living white flame leapt a
great white sheet spread out from the cylin-
der as the blast struck its surface a sheet
that widened and blindingly filled the room
but the cylinder remained intact the only
effect produced by the atomic blast being a
red-hot patch against its whiteness which
quickly cooled leaving only a faint dark
stain on its surface

  tan rokas laughter echoed mockingly
through the great room you did not be-
lieve me he said now you know

  i should have known admitted ken
that material capable of keeping atomic
force inside would be proof against an out-
side force he glanced upwards but per-
haps the tanks may prove a more vulnerable
target they only store the atomfuel

  try them invited tan roka mockingly
no ill save my blast charges for emer-
gencies tan roka snapped ken you
dont seem to realise that we have the upper
hand at the moment at least so far as you
are concerned one touch on this switch
and you follow gru nadar we could use
our advantage to bargain with you to save
our own lives and demand you release us
and our craft but we are both prepared to
lose our lives in ridding the earth of the
threat you and your kind are holding over
it we intend to destroy this infernal craft
tan roka

  -	that is something beyond your powers
replied the nogaeman you can destroy
me but that is all he looked at the tense
set-faced young earthman you will serve
no purpose in destroying me he added
and i am willing to come to terms with
you you are superior to the other earth-
men  have met and you can assist me in
ruling your own kind when we take over
your planet give me that weapon and i
promise that no harm shall befall you you
may join us in our work and you will be
taught many things and you will be treated
as one of us i make you both this offer out
of respect for your qualities

  out of respect for your own skin said
jimmy i wouldnt trust you as far as i
could throw you what do you say ken

   we are not interested in your offer said
ken coldly but we are interested in learn-
ing more about this craft tell me this he
said making a threatening motion with the
atoblaster where is the apparatus which
maintains atmospheric pressure within this
craft

   a look of alarm appeared in the dqep-set
eyes of tan roka it was a fleeting expres-
sion of fear but it was not lost on ken
jimmy immediately aware of his friends
design started slightly but made no com-
ment

  why do you ask that said tan roka
and immediately answered his own question
you imagine that you can destroy the pres-
sure equipment reduce our atmosphere to
a vacuum and thus cause the destruction of
every living being within our craft our
bodies will burst when atmospheric pressure
is removed and the craft itself will disin-
tegrate and you think i will assist you in
such a design

  ken frowned in perplexity tan rokas
logical summing-up constituted stalemate
and an insurmountable obstacle the
nogaeman had nothing to gain not even
his own life by revealing the location of the
pressure equipment and then his brow
cleared

  i shall come to terms with you tan
roka he said my intention is to destroy
this craft but only to protect the earth if
you and your people would go your own
way and seek an uninhabited planet we
would go and interfere with nothing but
even with you out of the way  do not
think the threat would be removed there-
fore i offer you your life you can come
with us to earth and make your home there
in return you will take us to and describe
the means uy which i can carry out thede-
struction of this craft

  tan roka made no reply he was staring
fixedly at the earthman his eyes bright and
compelling and ken became awaie of the
strange hypnotic power emanating from
those deep-set orbs a power which he had
briefly experienced at his first contact with
the nogaeman he felt his resolution ebbing
as tan roka took a long step towards him

  you will give me that weapon said
tan roka in a low compelling voice then
we shall discuss terms

  ken jimmy stared as his friend ex-
tended the hand holding the atoblaster
page 

thrills incorporated

dont-

  its all right ken stepped back shaking
his head violently you snapped me out
of it jimmy this chap has some sort of
hypnotic power but i wont risk looking at
his eyes again for any length of time 
well whats your answer tan roka do
you come with us

  ken jimmys voice was raised in
alarm get out run

  what ken swung round and saw that
a door on the far side of the chamber had
slid open and through the opening were
coining a line of the huge nogaemen 

   temporary sanctuary
wtih one bound jimmy reached the
 door leading to the control room
where he turned to see ken close behind
him tan roka made a move also but he
stopped abruptly under the menace of the
atoblaster

  keep moving jimmy commanded ken
urgently i cant hope to finish off all
these theres a dozen or more theyve
been working in that far room and now-
therere others coming this way cried
jimmy as a line of nogaemen appeared at
the entrance to the control room evidently
these men were taking over the work of the
others who had completed their time of
duty were sandwiched between em
the control officer at his panel had risen
too he took one step towards ken and it
was the last step he took without hesitation
the young earthman discharged his ato-
blaster there was a blinding flare of flame
and the nogaeman disappeared in a burst
of vapor the other huge beings who had
been converging on the two earthmen
checked their movement but a quickly rap-
ped-out order from tan roka set them
moving again

  back shouted ken at the same time
moving towards the outer door he held
the atoblaster threateningly before him but
he recalled that there were but two charges
left in the weapon orlce they were used he
and jimmy would be virtually helpless at the
hands of these powerful giants but the
nogaemen in spite of their leaders com-
mand were wary the lesson of the control
officer too vivid in their receptive minds to
goad the earthman into using the gun and
then one of the nogaemen attempting to
catch ken unawares leapt forward grab-

bing at the atoblaster and the second-last
charge spat death and disintegration

  the two earthmen then leapt from the
control room and down the sloping path
to the main promenade behind them liter-
ally devouring the distance with their great
legs poured the nogaemen other nogae
beings attracted by the unusual sight of
fleeing earthmen were coming quickly along
the wide promenade from different direc-
tions some from the higher levels others
from the smaller tracks from buildings on
the lower level

  straight ahead and up yelled jimmy
racing across the wide promenade to a
winding and at the moment deserted path
leading upwards the pursuing nogaemen
were close behind but in spite of their long
legs and enormous strength they were no
longer gaining on the two sturdy spacepilots
it seemed as though the additional weight of
the big-bodied nogaemen militated against
sustained running particularly uphill the
two earthmen reached a wide landing from
which a great web of tracks radiated lead-
ing to the tall dwellings

  along some of these tracks were nogae-
men and women moving towards the land-
ing jimmy choosing an unoccupied track
shot off at a tangent reaching a dwelling
the door of which was closed he stopped
panting until ken joined him

  dead end he gasped

  cant you get in said ken theyre
coming weve only got a minute he ran
his hand over the slightly raised ridge around
the door frame found a small projection
and pressed heavily and even as the first of
the pursuers reached the great platform the
door of the dwelling slid silently upwards

  he charged into the interior jimmy at his
heels the room was lofty and pervaded
by an opalescent glow from a concealed
lighting source the light seeming to eman-
ate from the walls themselves there were
several moulded form-fitting chairs around
the walls and one of these chairs ken
grasped and dragged back to the door at
the same time shouting to jimmy to investi-
gate further the interior of the dwelling
ill keep em back while you look around
he yelled

  at the door he saw that the pursuing
nogaemen were pouring along the aerial
pathway in a long line he waited until the
foremost was within a few yards of the
devouring comet

page 

door the huge nogaeman was already ex-
tending his great arms towards him when
ken suddenly lifted the chair and sent it
hurtling at the mans face it struck him
full in the chest with all the force behind it
that the young earthman could summon
the nogaeman caught in mid-stride lurched
to one side tried to regain his balance but
failed he uttered a great bellowing cry of
despair as he struck the low slim rail be-
side the aerial path and toppled hfad firs
to his death below the heavy thud of his
great body reaching the ears of the young
earthman

  the other nogaemen paused in their rush
while ken feverishly groping along the
inner door-frame found the control for the
door he pressed it and held it down
hoping that he would thus prevent the oper-
ation of the outer control a hope that was
shortly realised for he could hear his pur-

suers immediately outside the door which
however remained closed and then
jimmys voice from the rear of the building
called frantically ken quick

the green marble

leaving the door control ken ran
across the room and through an arch-
way into another and smaller room where
in alcoves in the wall were long built-in beds
in one comer of this room was a winding
ramp in lieu of a staircase as he entered
jimmy came tearing in from the far side

  theyre coming around the back en-
trance ken panted the plump youth

  	and theyre coming in the front way
too now said ken grimly as the sounds
of heavy footsteps reached them its up
that ramp for us and after that    he
left the sentence unfinished and ran to the
ramp he urged jimmy up ahead of him as
the first of the nogaemen entered the room
the giant in a few great strides reached the
ramp only yards behind ken and the young

spacepilot not daring to look back scuttled
up the winding incline expecting at any sec-
ond to feel the powerful hands grasping him

   the incline levelled out to a landing and
an open archway the two men shot through
the archway and found themselves again
out in the open this time on a fiat-topped
roof around them were the suspended
aerial pathways and galleries but there was
no exit from the roof itself ken ran to
the limit of the roof and looked down the
paths leading up to their refuge were literally
jammed with hundreds of the fiery comets
inhabitants a mass of smooth yellow faces
were turned up to them and a murmuring
ripple of deep voices rose as the two fugi-
tives were seen

   were trapped said ken bitterly that
fellow was right on our heels and there were
others behind him well just have to make
what sort of a fight we can

  theres an aerial path here called
jimmy from the opposite side we can leap
for it

  ken looked at the archway frowning
whats happened to that chap who was
chasing us he muttered hes given it
up he moved cautiously to the archway
and peered out and down the ramp there
was no sign of anyone either on the ramp
or in the room below miraculously the
house was deserted

   well that takes some beating said ken
blankly theyve gone-every one of em
time we went too said jimmy we
can make that aerial path ken its a long
leap and if we miss-well we wont know
much about it thats all if we wait here any
time theyll start swarming up that path and
cut us off

  id like to know what it all means
though said ken uneasily all right
jimmy well risk the jump

   but as they moved back towards he edge
of the roof a voice from below arrested
them

  earthmen it was tan rokas voice
they went again to the front of the house
and saw him below standing a little in front
of the silent mass of his fellow beings

  earthmen i have stopped my people
from pursuing you i know that you will
fight and that you will in the process be in-
jured or perhaps destroyed i wish to keep
you unharmed i tell you again that men
such as you will be most useful to me on
  page 

thrills incorporated

earth so i am giving you this last chance
are you prepared to join us and obey my
commands

   you are asking us to be a party to the
destruction of our kind shouted ken
there can only be one answer to that-
and its no

   i shall not bargain with you further
earthmen called tan roka you will be
destroyed at once

  quick jimmy said ken i dont
know what devilish means tan roka has to
destroy us but he seems mighty confident
make the jump and ill follow

   jimmy nodded sped back out of sight of
those below stepped on to the low parapet
and anxiously watched by his friend
launched himself at the aerial path his
plump body shot across the intervening gap
his fingers clutched the side of the pathway
and a moment later he hauled himself up
and was standing shakily on the path ken
stepped on to the parapet and as he did
so something sailed up from below and fell
on to the roof it was nothing more startling
than a pale green marble glowing a bright
green as though with an internal flame but
as he stared at it for an instant its shape
changed with astounding suddenness its
roundness became flattened and then like
lightning the entire roof was covered with a
brilliant green sheet like a film of green
ice

   ken waited no longer tan rokas con-
fident prediction of their early destruction
left no doubt in the earthmans mind that
this extraordinary manifestation was a lethal
one he leapt over the abyss reached and
climbed on to the path beside his friend

   look what you missed gulped jimmy
pointing a shaking hand at the roof from
the green sheet a vapor was rising heavy
and green it boiled up for a few seconds
only then appeared to condense into a huge
green blob of liquid whcih floated in the air
for a moment then with a little plop like a
bubble bursting it disappeared

   a lethal gas of some sort said ken
shuddering theyll use it again i wonder
they didnt use it before

  thats why said jimmy look

   ken stared the entire roof had disap-
peared the  two earthmen were looking
into the room below but there was no sign
of debris the material from which the roof
had been constructed had simply and sil-

ently ceased to exist as matter

  thats why echoed ken that weapon
is a two-way one it causes matter to disin-
tegrate to lose its identity and revert back
to a gaseous form from which all matter
originally was formed if they use it indis-
criminately against us theyre using it against
their precious comet creation and no
doubt they-or tan roka anyway-con-
siders that two puny beings like us are not
worth all that damage thats why he made
us that final offer-he didnt want to use
that green marble hell get a nasty shock
when he discovers that his trump card has
failed    jimmy he looked over the
edge of the path then upwards they
dont know weve escaped i cant see a
soul either below or above it looks as
though everyone not actually engaged in
some work or other is on the paths leading
to the front of that house and the walls are
screening us from them if we can only lie
low somewhere weve got a chance of doing
some sort of sabotage

       playing with fire
teeping to the rear of the damaged
house the two earthmen moved cau-
tiously up the path their objective being
another gallery a little distance ahead and
above on which were several small struc-
tures around them wound and stretched
the aerial paths their multiplicity confus-
ing to the sight but the tortuous design of
those elevated roadways and the crowds of
buildings perched in apparently precarious
and unexpected places was a blessing to the
fugitives as it was a comparatively simple
matter for them to find cover from any
searching eyes below

  they reached the first gallery and were
enabled to peer from one of the small build-
ings it held on to the dense crowd of nogae-
men below and as they looked the crowd
began to break up and move away most of
them going back to the low level but many
moving upwards

   weve got to try to get to the outer wall
of this globe jimmy said ken quickly
im satisfied that the atmosphere-producing
apparatus will be dispersed all around the
globe in order to keep up a uniform pres-
sure our best chance is to keep climbing
until we reach the top and if we make it
we can search for an opening which should
lead to the compartments between the inner
devouring comet

page 

  and outer walls but well have to keep
  under cover once they know were still
  alive well have no chance to do anything
  except try to escape them and their little
  green marbles some are coming up this
  way now so-

    yes interrupted jimmy ducking back
  to the cover of the structure and one of
  em is tan roka himself

    it would be said ken hes likely to
  have some of those confounded green
  marbles with him hell make no mistake
  this time unless i use the last charge in the
  atoblaster on him and once thats gone
  were helpless

    they entered the structure which ap-
  peared to be a sort of office containing as
  it did a large desk and several of the
  moulded chairs ken stood near the door-
  way he could hear the heavy footsteps of
  tan roka and his hand on the atoblaster
  he waited tensely the footsteps came
  closer so close that it seemed that tan roka
  was coming to the office building

     think hes making for here whis-
  pered ken and theres no back door to
  this place

    then its a showdown said jimmy
  youll have to use that last charge
  behind that chair said ken quickly
  ill take this one

    the two earthmen had barely time to
  conceal themselves behind two of the big
   moulded chairs before tan roka entered
  the office cautiously peering from behind
  his chair ken saw the big nogaeman move
  over to the desk ide open a drawer and
  drop something in o it then there came
  a faint click and tan roka lowering him-
  self into the chair at the desk was speaking
  apparently into some communication instru-
  ment the words were in the nogae tongue
  and meaningless to the earthmen he
  spoke at great length nd one word for
  which there was obviously no equivalent in
  the nogae tongue earthmen told the
  listeners that he was broadcasting through
  the craft the recent happenings his speech
  concluded tan roka rose and quitted the
  room and the two earthmen emerged ken
  went straight to the desk and opened the
  drawer inside were several round brown
  objects like walnuts

    i thought they would be those little
  green marbles he said in disappointed
  tones i noticed that the first thing tan
  roka did when he entered was to drop

something in here it looked as though he
was returning his unused- wait though
he twisted the brown nut and found that it
was in two threaded sections a few more
turns and it came apart revealing a dull
grey glassy marble the two men stared at
the thing and then the greyness gave way to
a dull green which became brighter as they
looked at it

  gosh involuntarily ken uttered a yell
as the significance of that increasing glow
struck him the things livening up when
its released from its shell it becomes
active with shaking fingers he tried to
restore the upper portion of the shell but
already the green marble now glowing with
a blinding brilliance was changing shape
he raced to the door and flung the thing
out

     sabotage attempt
jhrom their retreat the two friends
watched the descent of the glowing
marble it dropped down down missing
the paths by inches a tiny devastating
meteor until it struck the lowermost path
far below and then it seemed that a great
lake of green spread over the surface fol-
lowed by the now-familiar boiling up of
the green vapour fascinated they watched
the atomic drama below saw the cloud
condense into a bright bubble saw the
bubble burst and then a great black patch
and above this patch was a cleared space
where only a few seconds before had been
part of the tracery of aerial paths

  whew ken mopped his streaming
forehead its certainly violeni and so
absolutely silent its pierced the inner skin
of the craft judging by that black crater
i wonder if that force would be effective
against those atomfuel cylinders gosh if
i could get near them id try it anyway
weve got no hope of getting away alive
-that is if we intend to wreck this floating
menace so well take a supply of these pills
and use em indiscriminately

  weve given these fellows something to
think about now commented jimmy look-
ing down at the great crowd which had
assembled around the damaged portion
tan roka will have a pretty strong sus-
picion that we werent disintegrated

  he eyed the maze of paths consideringly
and finally indicated one which ran hori-
zontally from the office

  theres our path jimmy he said deci-
sively its the one track that doesnt

appear to lead upwards and that means it
must eventually lead to the side of the globe
its quite likely that it does lead to some
vital function because its coming direct
from this broadcasting room and office used
by tan roka himself all we have to do is
get clear without being seen    grab some
of those green marbles too and well
move

  jimmy obeyed and the two earthmen
moved lrom the office stepping from the
gallery on to the horizontal path they
moved slowly stopping now and again at
spots which gave them cover from any
watching eyes below but there was no indi-
cation of an alarm from the nogaemen
still no doubt puzzling over the disaster that
had befallen them the path continued in
a dead straight line and the further they
went the more convinced was ken that his
theory was correct that it would eventually
lead them to the limits of the globe

  this is it cried jimmy at last as
directly ahead the path ended at a studded
door similar to that of the control room
he ran forward searching for a means of
opening the door but there was no evidence
of a controlling medium probably con-
trolled from inside he muttered

  that means there is always someone
working in there said ken well weve
got to take the risk im going to try out
one of these green marbles its either that
or the atoblaster and i want to keep that
last charge for a last emergency as he
spoke he removed the cap from one of the
marbles and placed the marble against the
studded door then stepping back sonie
yards the two men waited results as they
watched the glowing green marble a sudden
swelling roar from below reached their ears

  were spotted groaned jimmy
theyre starting to climb after us

   the words had scarcely left his lips than
a blinding green sheet spread across the
metal in front of them they staggered
back as the lethal vapour spread outwards
and boiled towards them and when the
bubble formed and burst they saw a great
gap in the wall ahead there was also a
gap in the path where the material had dis-
integrated but they cleared this without
difficulty and found themselves in a great
cavern of a room with its far wall concave
indicating the outer shell of the fiery comet

  there were great cylinders ranged in
orderly rows on the level where they stood

and on lower levels were similar rows of
cylinders as far as the two men could see
pistons protruded from these cylinders and
entered a huge tube which ran around the
outer wall the pistons pumping rhythmic-
ally

  this is the apparatus for maintaining
atmospheric pressure im sure of that now
said ken but its only a small part of
it if we wreck this section some other
portion of it will probably maintain pressure
automatically a huge system like this
couldnt possibly be destroyed unless we
could get to the very heart of it still   
he took two of the green marbles from his
pocket removed their caps and placed
them beside two of the cylinders we may
as well do as much damage as we can while
we can he added grimly and now well
see if we cant trace this system to its
primary source

  he led the way down to the next level
they reached it at the same moment that
two nogaemen clad in tight-fitting stained
overalls emerged from a chamber on that
level

a way out

it was jimmy who accounted for these two
giants and at the same time causing the
disintegration of part of the gallery and in
the meantime the green marbles above set
up a billowing cloud of green vapour but
the effect produced on the atmosphere mech-
anism remained unknown to the two earth-
men

  they raced down the tracks towards the
lowest level without seeing anything that
looked like a focal point for the great tube
and its feeding cylinders and when they
reached the flat expanse of floor level they
stopped baffled

  weve done some damage panted ken
but in spite of the power of these marbles
the effect is too localised its like trying to
kill an elephant by sticking pins into its
hide

  from above there came sounds of pur-
suit as the nogaemen who had climbed the
tracks after them were now hot on their
trail

  how many of these marbles are left
asked ken i have four

  five said jimmy

  right perhaps we can kill our elephant
if the pin is big enough well make a pile
of em and see if the effect is strong enough
to cripple the apparatus it wont need to

be out of commission long to make these
nogaemen swell and burst

  the advance guard of their pursuers had
reached the second lowest level and the two
earthmen raced away at the same time
taking the green marbles from their pockets
and loosening the caps for their last attempt
they came to a halt at another studded
door but the controlling switch was clearly
visible they operated it stepped into
another vast cavern and saw before them
their spaceship

  jimmy gasped but ken merely nodded
i thought we werent far from it he said
we knew it was against the outer wall
and that it was on the lowest level and on
this side of the globe but it might as well
be millions of miles away for all the good
its going to do us

  he looked around the cavern and his gaze
fell on the huge pillars which tan roka had
told them controlled the gravity and ultra-
gravity force he gripped jimmys arm
theres a chance he said quickly if we
have time into the craft see if the atom-
fuel is still there

  without questioning his friends object
jimmy opened the airlock and dived into
the little craft its still here he yelled

  grab a cylinder of spare fuel then
called ken his eyes on the approaching
nogaemen who were now on the lowest
level he took the cylinder of atomfuel
which the sweating jimmy handed out
were going to use this fuel to set up a
chain reaction inside those pillars remem-
ber what tan roka told us - that those
pillars control the ultra-gravity system and
are connected to the control room theyll
certainly control the gravity system too
and thats part of the atmospheric pressure
system as well it must be all linked to-
gether in the control room if we can break
the outer casing with a chain reaction it
will react throughout the entire globe

  but-

  dont talk shouted ken wildly put
it over beside the pillar with shaking
hands he took one of the green marbles
from his pocket and placed it at the great
door through which their craft had first been
drawn this calls for timing he said try-
ing to keep his voice steady this marble
should act first leaving us a gap to get out
into space then the others grouped
around the atomfuel should act setting up
a chain-reaction he sped across to the

pillar and both he and jimmy removed the
caps from the marbles and ran back to the
craft jimmy tumbled in and ken was
about to follow suit when he was arrested
by the voice of tan roka at the head of the
nogaemen

collapse

he young spacepilots first impulse was i
to dive into the craft after his friend
but tan roka held in his huge hand one
of the green marbles and ken knew that if
it struck the little craft disaster would
follow already the marble in the nogae-
mans hand was glowing brightly

  goodbye earthman called tan roka
raising his arm

  goodbye yelled ken at the same time
firing the last charge from his atoblaster
and the commander of the fiery comet dis-
solved in atomic death with his arm still
upraised

  a green flare to his right warned ken
that the marble at the door was taking
effect and that in a matter of split seconds
the atomful pile would have its terrific
energy released he flung himself headfirst
into the airlock and fell in a heap at
jimmys feet its done it his friends
voice raised almost to a scream was in his
ears he felt a lurching sensation and he
was tossed against the foamrubber walls
then he clambered to his feet and looked
through the glastic screen and saw with a
feeling of unutterable thankfulness that the
craft was out in space once more

  there wasnt much in it gulped jimmy
his face deathly white with the reaction
the hole was large enough to let half-a-
dozen craft through but i had to take it
at an angle i think i scraped the sides
my heart as in my mouth for a minute

  the fiery comet cried ken look at
it-look

  against the black space sky the comet
with its great flaring tail was slowly chang-
ing shape no longer was it a globe it was
crumbling into an oval which in turn slowly
assumed a wrinkled jagged sausage-shape
the fiery tail became dull and the whole
crushed mass suddenly burst into a blinding
green mass of light  and a moment
later there was nothing but the blackness
of space   

  the fiery comet said ken taking his
eyes from the glastic screen it lived up to
the name we gave it right to the end

he fired and flame enveloped
the nearest house then came a
second blast of ravening des-
truction-a third-a fourth

it was only the dew-god making a mon-
strous noise off in the darkness but
fahnes allowed his eyes to open and he
halfway sat up there was a shaded light
over by boles bunk and boles was fussily
arranging his kit for a journey to the trad-
ing-centre in the lamphian hills food
canteens and the trading-stuff these things
would be left at the untended mart in ex-
change for a new lot of ilossa fiber which
on earth was equal in exchange pound for
pound with platinum

  fahnes made an apologetic noise as boles
whirled at his movement boles snorted in-
dignantly

  its just one of them gods he said
scornfully they make a racket like that
before dawn every mornin

  fahnes made himself grin sheepishly as
if half-awake he knew about the dew-god
he had more brains than boles and he
knew more than boles about all the things
that really mattered on oryx though hed
only been on the small planet five months
because of his knowledge hed been awake
for hours feverishly debating with himself
whether as a matter of commonsense he had

not better murder boles this morning
there were reasons for killing him but it
would be satisfying to let boles come back
from the lamphian hills to find the trading-
post in ashes the honkie village a mere
black scar on the green surface of oryx and
the supply ship come and gone

  i know said fahnes he yawned now
but the racket does seem louder than
usual this morning i wonder-
regulations say native customs an re-
ligions aint to be messed with said boles
inflexibly you aint paid to wonder quit
it

the unholy racket which was the dew-
god off beyond the jungle seemed to
grow louder yet no man it was said in the
instructions for oryx had ever yet seen a
dew-eod but the native deities were of
regulations

extreme importance to the honkies and
the maintenance of trade-relations required
that their religion should be undisturbed

  boles zipped his suit shut he began to
struggle into the various straps which would
hold the articles of his equipment about him
fahnes watched with concealed amusement
the honkie religion was not to be meddled
with

  the windows of the trading-post rattled
from a sudden special uproar from the god
he fahnes knew things about the honkie
religion that boles didnt that the survey-
party apparently hadnt found out gods
which roared in the darkness could arouse
the curiosity even of a man like fahnes
who despised such stupidities as gods and
regulations fahnes had taken satisfaction
in breaking the regulations about honkies
under boles very nose hed set up a
camera and flashbulb and trigger-string off
where the dew-god roared even now and he
fahnes had a photograph of a dew-god

  the blinding flash of the flash-bulb had
startled it it had crashed into a jungle-tree
in its flight and at the scene of the accid-
ent-the crystal was in the pocket of fahnes
sleeping-suit-hed found a memento of
honkie religion it had been torn from the
headdress of the dew-god the photograph
of the dew-god told how many more such
mementos the dew-god wore in his head-
dress so fahnes had planned murder for
this morning and was still in two minds
about its necessity the prospects before
him were enough to make a man giddy

  but he wasnt giddy his plan was care-
fully worked out it was so brilliant that
hed honestly regretted that nobody would
ever know how magnificent it had been
but thered been two breaks-one a space-
radio message and the other this decision
of boles to make the trip fahnes could
leave boles alive to realise his situation if
he chose when boles came back six days
from now hed understand not completely
perhaps but a memento--a small one left
on a stick where hed be sure to see it-
would enable him to piece out the story
bit by bit as he tried hopelessly to live until
another ship came to rebuild human trade
on oryx

  boles was festooned with all the impedi-
menta that regulations said should be car-
ried on any journey on oryx it was still
dead-dark outside the dew-god still
roared though more faintly now

  all right said boles curtly im off
mind you stick to regulations while im
gone

eahnes slung the flame-rifle over his
- shoulder made sure the bolt-pistol was
ready for action and marched off toward
the honkie village there were four or five
hundred honkies in the soapstone huts of
the settlement they were greenish in tint
and while their skin was not in actual plates
like insects it was thick and stiff and really
flexible only at the joints they were sol-
emn-faced and quiet and lived their whole
lives in a passioned absorption in their
religion as boles lived his in devotion to
regulations boles said that their religion
was regulations and that it made sense

  then he reached the village every
house was built of blocks of soapstone
carved to perfection and ornamented with
elaborate designs for which fahnes at this
moment had no taste the soapstone
boles had said had been brought on hon-
kie-back for fifty miles or more just so the
village could be built where there was no
red clay under the soil to be turned up by
an incautious hoe it had stood here for
generations perhaps for a thousand years

  he fired coruscating flame enveloped
the nearest house there was the roar of
suddenly-expanded air and of burning a
second blast of ravening destruction a
third-a fourth

  he saw a few furtive fugitive move-
ments the honkies in the village had fled

  he fired the flame-gun again from sheer
destructiveness then went snarling into the
temple ready to deal out death to anyone
who dared to dispute anything with him

the tall honkie squatted on the ground
outside the trading-post and worriedly
mouthed his few words of terrestrial speech
boles listened with an air of indignation

  your runner caught up to me an
brought me back boles said dogmatic-
ally accordin to regulations i got to help
you out any way i can but this is bad

  the honkie struggled again to convey
his meaning in earth language then he
fell back upon his own tongue

  lord he said with dignity it was
the dew-gods doing we do not understand
the man came through our fields approach-
ing our village and this was against the
law so all our people pretended not see
page 

thrills incorporated

lest he be shamed yet he had no shame
even in breaking the law he shouted at
us in the fields he went to the village
where again those who were present pre-
tended nof to see then he took an instru-
ment we know not and struck houses with
it destroying everything

  a flame-gun said boles scowling
this is goin to make trouble he busted
regulations

  he went into the temple of the dew-
god the worried honkie chieftain went on
with dignified emphasis and there are
bright stones which look like the dew save
that they also hard and we carve our bowls
and houses with them but often because
they are like the dew we give them to the
dew-god the man seemed to desire them
greatly he tore them from the walls of the
temple where they are set and then he
saw the inner part of the temple where the
dew-gods holiness -stays we had put the
most beautiful of the bright stones there
and the dew-gods holiness covered them
but the man desired the stones so greatly
that he threw himself into the dew-gods
holiness and he could not endure it so
he died

   the dew-gods holiness eh said boles
sceptically

  the dew-god said the honkie chief
practically shakes the dew from our crops
before dawn so that they do not change
color and grow uneatable like the wild
things of the jungle one of us each morn-
ing carries his headdress and blows his
horn for him among the crops as the dew
falls from the leaves it hurries to the dew-
gods temple each morning dew-drops by
millions run into his temple and gather in a
great deep gathering which is the holiness
of the dew-god and we place the brightest
stones there to welcome them boles
blinked then he jumped

  holy he cried the dews like a
rainstorm shook off all at once an you
got a drainage system sure you got a
dewpond in the temple a lake a swim-
min-pool full of shook-off dew an bright
stones were there

   lord the bright stones are covered by
the holiness for a large space said the
honkie chieftain apologetically and the
man seemed to desire them greatly if we
had understood we would have given them
to him we bring them from a great dis-
tance but it is our religion freely to give

one another the things that are most desir-
able if it is the custom of men to desire
those bright stones we would surrender
them

 doles looked at the glittering handful
 of crystals he had taken from the
 pockets of fahnes after the honkies had
 brought him back

    it aint worth while he said vexedly
 they what man call zircons they pretty
 but there aint any value to em for trade
 they just hard enough to use as tools to
 cut soapstones fahnes thought they were
 diamonds  guess when he saw a swim-
 ming pool carpeted with diamonds on the
 bottom he went outa his head he dived for
 em an the pools probly deeper than it
 looks he hopped in to grab zircons he
 thought was diamonds an there wasnt any
 steps like a swimmin-pool should have an
 he couldnt get out again so he drowned-
 on oryx where it never rains good grief

   the dew-god destroyed him because he
 broke the law said the honkie respect-
 fully

   he died because he was a fool who
 didnt keep to regulations said boles caus-
 tically
