font you know dear reader that
its a mighty useful thing to e a
good guesser it reminds me of a story
they tell about a circus in a small coun-
try town the usual crowd of small
boys was gathered about the entrance
of the tent when a benevolent-looking
old gentleman came along and stood
watching them for a few minutes with
a beaming eye then walking up to the
ticket taker he said smilingly

  let all these boys in and count
them

  the gateman thinking the benevo-
lent-looking old gentleman was indulg-
ing in a bit of philanthropy did as re-
quested when the last lad had gone
in he turned and announced 
twenty-four sir

  thats fine said the benevolent-
looking old gentleman as he walked
away i thought i guessed right

  as a matter of fact an editor has
simply got to be a mighty good guesser
when it comes to picking out stories
that he thinks will interest his readers
and whenever he guesses wrong he is
not in the enviable position of the
benevolent-looking old gentleman able
to just turn round and walk away-not
much he simply has to sit tight on
the job bow his head to the storm and
-guess again all this is inflicted on
you because peoples editor has been
muchly patting himself and being patted
on the back for making such a good
guess about high speed in the sep-
tember number it just seemed to hit
the bulls-eye of his readers approval
judging from the nice letters he has re-
ceived about it hence all the pats

af

talking talbot the complete
novel in this issue represents an-
other big guess which your editor be-
lieves is going to bit the bulls-eye of

your approval in exactly the same place
high speed did you remember the
remark some celebrated old fellow got
off about rather being right than presi-
dent well thats just the way your
editor feels this minute and if you hap-
pen to think he is right wont you just
pass along the glad tidings and make
him feel real good please do

  mr john r coryell who made our
guess about talking talbot possible
is a new contributor to peoples pages
and may not be well known to some of
you the best introduction we can give
him is to let him introduce himself in
his own autobiography here you are

  id as lief write my obituary as my
autobiography but  know better than
to refuse when an editor asks for it so
here it is

  born in new york city december
 which makes me thirty-six
doesnt it or are my figures mixed
but it doesnt matter how many years
ive lived its how  have lived them-
and that is most joyously there is
nothing i would like better than to live
them all over again

  public school ami city college for
preliminary education  travel and news-
paper work higher education i was a
mighty poor newspaper man but  have
been a good traveler africa and aus-
tralia are the only places i havent been
in and their turn is coming

  when i failed at newspaper work
i wrote popular science stuff for the
magazines then i took up story writ-
ing for boys diego iinzon a story
of the voyage of columbus was prett
well known in its time i wrote stead
ilv for all the juvenile publications un-
til one day i tried my hand at a story
for adults writing under a pseudonym
that was a considerable success and i
have been pseudonymous ever since
peoples

  the creation of the now famous
nick carter was one of my greatest

successes 

  i dont know how many stories i
have written but the number goes be-
yond two hundred full-sized novels and
many short stories now i am shame-
lessly writing under my own name

  why any one should care to know
these things about me  dont know but
the editor thinks they will care so
please accept my apologies anybody
who agrees with me

  i forgot to say that i have never
 ceil guilty of writing verse but that
 have written four plays one of the
plays was about to be produced in lon-
don when the war broke out isnt it
an accursed war

many of you seemed to like our
guess about -a son of the cin-
cinnati that we wrote bedford-jones
to give us another chance to guess along
the same lines ilis response came in
the shape of trails chivalrous and
believe me it didnt take much guessing
it is -imply great it is historical cor-
rect in every last detail and presents a
picture of the ireat lakes at the time
of the war of  which is both in-
structive and interesting it is all
ction full of virility and nerve-break-
ing adventure with the sweetest ten-
derest thread of romance running
through it you ever read you will get
it complete in the next issue of peo-
ples and its dollars to one of your sus-
pender buttons-if you happen to be
built that way-that you will come back
at us and say we are the champion lit-
tle guesser

  some wise old fellow once remarked
that the more he saw of men the better
he liked dogs mighty few men or
women either but what feel the same
way and to this great army of lovers

of mans best friend we offer a splen-
did series entitled boru by j allan
dunn which will commence in the next

last word it displays an unusually inti-
mate knowledge of the dog and a truly
poetic appreciation of the beauties of
nature we believe we are offering
you a huge treat in presenting this series

talbot

coryell

for a few seconds he was conscious only of looking into a small inclosure
which had once been a garden but which now bore not only the blight of a
cold november but of years of neglect a small stone cottage stood in the
midst of the garden and beyond stretched the well-kept grounds of the castle

chapter i

oh how cruel make him stop
somebody make him stop

        a lot of several hundred
horses was being loaded on a train at
a siding in texas destined for the
british troops in france

  it was a scene of excitement noise
and bustle frightened horses plunging
biting kicking squealing men shout-
ing and swearing

  a party of men and women betrayed
by their dress as strangers were sit-
ting their horses grouped together
watching the proceedings with a lively
interest

  the horses were all broken but ter-
ror and excitement had made them rest-
less and difficult to handle most of
the men x-ecognizing the state the ani-
mals were in were gentle with them
but one big evil-looking fellow seemed


peoples

to know no other method but that of
violence and finally had undertaken to
drive a high-spirited terrified horse
into the car by kicking it brutally

  it was one of the ladies of the party
who had voiced her horror appealing
to the gentleman near her a man who
sat his horse in a fine military way
make him stop colonel

  the fellahs a bally brute said the
colonel but hesitated in indecision

  before he could have done anything
even had he moved quickly another
man had acted with a swift easy
stride he was by the mans side his
hand on his arm

  stop that he said quietly

  buck corson in the habit of doing
as he pleased shook off the hand and
delivered the kick he had started the
next instant he was caught in a grip
of steel and sent sprawling in the dust

  he fell almost under the feet of the
horses of the spectators he poured
out a string of oaths as he scrambled to
his feet and would have had his gun
out if two men hadnt caught him cry-
ing out warningly as if with one voice
you fool its talkin talbot
buck stared foolishly then swal-
lowed and sneaked away to another
part of the place talbot meanwhile
seemed to pay no attention to the man
but having quickly secured the horse
was carefully running his hand over
its belly to ascertain whether or not
it had been hurt satisfied that it was
uninjured he petted it for a moment
and then led it gently up the gangplank

  talking talbot murmured the
young woman who had cried out
what a funny name

  what a splendid specimen of a
man said an older woman who is
he mr trenchard she turned to a
ranchman who was one of the party

  bob trenchard smiled as all the faces
were turned in curiosity to catch his
answer hes generally called talk-
ing talbot hes the owner of a ranch

near here and he was clever enough
to know that horses would be in de-
mand in europe and to buy them up all
over the country as soon as war was
declared

  is he what you call a bad man
out here asked the young woman in
a low tone looking with mingled ad-
miration and fear at talbot who was
now moving away from the group -
no laughed trenchard hes a
good citizen

  well persisted the girl i noticed
that ruffian was frightened the instant
he heard his name

  he sure was talbots a terror to
that sort the fellow came with a lot
of horses i reckon and didnt know
talbot by sight he knew him by name
all right though

 he looks capable-what said
colonel st john the colonel was the
purchasing agent for the british gov-
ernment

  ive think lies mighty capable colo-
nel answered trenchard hes
johnny on the spot if you know what
that means

  i cawnt say i do but id like to
well hesitated trenchard its
like this if theres anything that needs
to be done hes always doing it by
the time other people are coming to
the conclusion theyll get together and
tackle it

  this was a bad country when he
came out here seven years ago you
never knew when your horses were go-
ing to be rustled hed been here a
year i reckon and we were all talking
about getting together and putting an
end to the way things were going he
didnt do any talking at all but just
got out and shot up a few rustlers
in that terribly quiet way of his
you mean he killed them cried
the girl

  he never killed one of them didnt
have to the first time he came on
a rustler with some of his horses the
talking talbot



man started to draw his gun he got
it out but he never lifted it talbots
bullet shattered his thumb everybody
thought it was an accident until the
same thing happened to the next man
after five of em had their right hands
shot up we all knew it was done on
purpose

  my word said colonel st john
thats good shooting

  oh hes some shot all right the
quickest gun thrower in texas why
there was a real bad man heard about
him-a cow-puncher from down near
the border-and nothing would do but
he must come hunting talbot some
of us heard about him and warned
talbot

  yes cried the young woman and
then 

  talbot was quiet for a moment then
asked where the man was we told
him the man was in the town he sad-
dled his horse without a word and rode
up to town we followed it was easy
enough to find the fellow strangers are
known right off you see he was
standing in front of a saloon talking

  i reckon some one told him talbot
was coming for he stepped out as if
he was going to stop talbot well
talbot was off his horse in a minute
and you may be sure there wasnt any-
body behind either of them

   so youre talkin talbot said the
gunman

   so-called answered talbot very
even

  they watched each other steadily
i think there was something in talbot
that got the other fellows nerve any-
how he gave a quick glance around as
if he didnt half like the situation tal-
bot all the while cold as ice

   i bin lookin fer you said the other
fellow

   im here was all talbot said

   i hear youre some gun thrower
said the other

  well demanded talbot

   im goin to find out was the an-
swer and what followed was so quick
you couldnt see it but that fellows
bullet hit the dust within two inches of
talbots foot

  and talbots queried the girl
where did his hit

  went clean through the fellows
hand breaking two bones

  they all turned and looked at talbot
who was moving about quietly direct-
ing the loading he was quite six feet
in height but so well proportioned that
he did not look tall he moved like
a man who had enormous reserves of
muscular power he spoke seldom but
his manner was masterful

  why do they call him talking tal-
bot asked the girl whose curiosity
was stimulated by her admiration is
it because he is so silent

  the rancher laughed i reckon the
name sticks for that reason and partly
because of the t t alliterative you
see easy to say no the boys got
to saying that talbot talked with his
gun and so the name came

  he jolly well knows how to handle
a horse said the colonel

  you bet he does was the enthusi-
astic response men too why mrs
martin you must remember when

chester talbot-

  is that chester talbot cried the
lady

  thats chester talbot why colo-
nel he went to one of the small col-
leges back east anti was famous as
half back on the football team his
last year they made him captain and
that year the team cleaned up every-
thing-harvard yale princeton every
one of them wasnt defeated once
the papers were full of it

  and hes been out here all these
years commented mrs martin he
disappeared in a sensational sort of
way and this is the first ive heard of
him


peoples

  oh please do tell us about it cried
the girl he just fits into a romance
mrs martin seeing they were all in-
terested shrugged her shoulders and
told the story it isnt much though
it created a lot of interest at the time
as mr trenchard says he was a fa-
mous football hero his father was a
multimillionaire and failed-went all
to pieces-just as ghes talbot was
graduated he was engaged to mar-
garet cranston-you know the cran-
stons-and she threw him over then
the story was that he took to drinking
and went down into the gutter

  good gracious he doesnt look it
exclaimed the girl

  he never touches liquor said
t renchard

  well that was the story and he dis-
appeared anyhow and to think of his
coming out here you say hes mak-
ing a success

  sure thing hed make a success
of anything he undertook

  i wish said colonel st john hed
undertake to land those horses in
france for me

  not likely have you asked him
  ya-as

  he refused

  he looked at me-i never saw such
eyes-as if to make sure i was in ear-
nest what then he smiled and
walked away never said a word  not
a bally word

  but you understood him laughed
trenchard

  jolly well i did laughed the colo-
nel felt like a bally ass too what
but hes just the man for it

  he delivers them in new york
doesnt he demanded trenchard
ya-as i pay him there

  he goes to new york cried mrs
martin i wonder if hell call on his
old friends i must write and tell all
about him is he married

  no and never looks at a marriage-
able woman i reckon i know why

now always thought there was a
story

chapter ii

  the trainload of horses had been de-
livered and paid for and chester tal-
bot was preparing to return to his ranch
anxious to be on his way he had re-
mained in hoboken all the time hadnt
crossed the river to the big city

  if there was any bitterness in his
feeling for his old home it didnt show
in his conduct he had stood on the
end of the wharf while the horses
were being loaded on the steamer
studying the wonderful sky line across
the river with interest and admiration

  he had not wavered for a moment
however in his determination not to go
to new york he knew he would cer-
tainly be recognized and called on for
explanations and why should he ex-
plain no his life was in the west
he would go back without seeing any-
body

  a letter was pushed under his door
after the primitive fashion of the sec-
ond-rate hotel where he was stopping
it made a very faint noise but his hear-
ing was very keen he turned and
saw it

  a mistake he thought there was
no one to write to him no one in the
wide world he went over and picked
it up and looked at the address it
was for him and in a womans hand-
writing

  he frowned slightly his lean brown
face seeming to harden who could
know he was there above all what
woman and why should any woman
write to him

  it seemed as if he was minded to toss
the letter into the wastebasket he held
it by one corner for a moment then
changed his mind and opened it with
cold deliberation

  dear chester it began he looked
for the signature nathalie brook-
field oh he murmured his face
talking talbot



softening wonderfully as he began to
read

  dear chester i learned by the merest
chance that you were here i have waited
hoping you would come to see me since
you do not i must ask you to come-beg
you to come if that is necessary you can
do something for me at least i think you
can if you are what you used to be i am
sure you can please come i need you

             a ffectionately

nathalie brookfield

  he folded the letter and put it in his
pocket his face troubled in another
moment he was on his way he took
the tunnel cars and went under the river
and as far uptown as they would carry
him a taxi took him to fifty-sixth
street just west of fifth avenue he
knew the house well

  he was shown to the reception room
it was just as he remembered it and it
brought a gentle smile to his face as he
looked around he heard a rusde of
silk and faced the door a beautiful
woman of forty-five came toward him
with hands outstretched a glad smile
on her careworn face

  you came at once chester she
said gratefully as he took her hands in
his

  did you doubt that i would dear
lady he answered studying her face
earnestly i would have responded to
such a call no matter where i was my
one good friend when all the others
had failed me

  no i didnt doubt you chester
she looked him over while he kept his
eyes on her face all the change in
you is for the better and that is saying
very much you have prospered
thanks to you

  oh no thanks to yourself chester
and there has never been another
woman 

  no other and never will be if you
had a daughter perhaps and he
smiled with wonderful tenderness
yes he went on in a certain curt
decisive way peculiar to him i have

prospered not rich but i have plenty

for my needs and in the way of making
more

  i am so glad chester i never
doubted that you would

  shall we sit down he arranged
the chairs so that they would be close
together and face to face if i speak
of myself he went on before she
could say anything it is because i
want you to know what little there is
to know before you tell me why you
want me you are in some trouble and
think i can help you

  oh i dont know she cried her
lips quivering when i heard you
were so near i remembered your cour-
age and resourcefulness and turned to
you you seemed the very one now
i dont know

  i know he snapped his firm jaws
setting i can help you dear friend
let me tell you about myself briefly
i have a ranch worth all of one hundred
thousand dollars i have over one hun-
dred thousand in cash i have fifty thou-
sand safely invested i have perfect
health some experience and absolute
confidence in myself everything to
the last drop of blood to the last cent
i lay at your feet

 oh chester so much for so
little

  it is so little for so much dear lady
do you remember the broken-hearted
only half-sober boy you found one
morning in his rooms that boy you
risked your reputation to save you
left a ballroom to come to me because
you had heard i was on the verge of
suicide if you had been discovered
there or known to be there your repu-
tation would have been gone

  i had loved your father

  you sobered me you made me look
life squarely in the face you put your
arms about me and kissed me you
saved me if you could only guess how-
grateful  am for the chance to do some-


peoples

thing for you while sorry for the need
now tell me

  the tears were rolling down her face
now hope had released them it is
my boy donald she said

  little donald

  you forget the years chester hes
as big as you

  he hasnt-hasnt started on the
way i took

  oh no but he was in paris when
the war broke out-studying art he
-she bit her lip to control herself-
he went to the front

  yes

 he-hes been missing for six
weeks

a prisoner in germany of course
thats what i hope thats what i
hope but oh chester i can get no
word of him not a word and ive
used money and influence im afraid

hes-hes-- she broke down and

sobbed her hands over her face

  talbot started up and walked the
floor several times then went to her
side and kneeling put his arm about
her

  he isnt dead dont be afraid of
that dear lady if he had been you
would have known it before this hes
a prisoner and ill find him dont
worry any more

  she turned and looked into his strong
face wiping her tears away it was
an inspiration to send for you you
bring back my courage but-and
her voice faltered-i dont know what
you can do i have had inquiries made
through the german embassy i have
had ambassador gerard urged by our
government and by personal friends to
look for him i have done everything
that any one could suggest you know
i can command so much influence
what-what are you thinking of
im going to search the prisons of
germany and austria dear lady

  ou- he had spoken so quietly

that it seemed as if she could not have
understood you will do what

  he patted her reassuringly on the
arm and rose to his feet i will see
every prisoner in germany and aus-
tria  i will- but there im going

to find him

  but you cant leave- she began

protestingly

  i can do anything in this world that
i want to do and i want to find don
more than i want to do anything else
but-

  the discussion is ended dear
friend he said with an air of finality
now to ways and means

  you will need money luckily i

have plenty qf that but-

  there are no buts you will point
out all the avenues of your influence to
me and put me in the way of using
them come you have memoranda
letters information i want everything
shall we sit down now have you
time

  how energetic you are how hope-

inspiring and you are sure you-

  dear lady do i look uncertain if
i could only make you understand my
joy in being able to serve you  there 
dont waste time over that let me
see everything that will help me show
me what youve done

  they spent until midnight looking
over letters cablegrams notes in dis-
cussing the details of what had been
done in writing letters of introduction
for talbots use

  there he said finally standing up
and buttoning his coat now to start
things

  you seem to know just what you
will do she said with a sigh of relief
and a look of admiration nobody
else has

  nobody else cared as much good
night theres a man i must see to-
night if possible he will give me my
first start he took her hand and
kissed it with profound courtesy

  when shall i see you again she
asked

  i dont know i go now to make
sure of my passage over under the best
conditions then on to washington to
interview these people and get my pass-
port ill see you again before  start
he went quickly he was going to
see colonel stjohn if possible it was
late but he knew the club the colonel
put up at and knew he was likely to
keep late hours

  the colonel in fact had just come
in and on receipt of talbots card had
him brought in at once anything
wrong he demanded voicing his first
thought

  nothing colonel when you asked
me to take the shipload of horses over

to the other side-

  it was a mistake mr talbot inter-
rupted the colonel flushing

  is the offer still open asked tal-
bot

  why-why stammered the colonel
yes i suppose so

  i would like to consider it let me
explain why he told in a few words
of the disappearance of donald brook-
field and of his determination to hunt
for him it occurred to me he went
on that if i took your horses over
you might be willing to help me get to
the front to talk with some of the fel-
lows who were in the company with
donald you see i shall need all pos-
sible influence

  it will be quite easy the head of
the commissariat department is a per-
sonal friend-a good sort ill give you
a letter to him hell help you if he
can

  when is the boat to start

  theres a small lot of horses to come
yet but were hoping to get her off
on saturday-four days from now
its understood then said talbot
ill see you friday night im off for
washington now thank you good
night

  the next morning as soon as it was
possible to do anything talbot was
going about washington in a limousine
which he had engaged for the day
thanks to the letters he carried from
a person of so much social importance
as mrs brookfield he transacted his
business with unusual swiftness

  with all his expedition however
there was an inevitable quantity of red
tape to be unrolled and tied and untied
he was compelled to go to one legation
and another several times to the state
department many times

  he never lost his quiet imperturba-
bility however never relaxed his per-
tinacious grasp on the object in view
he acted always as if he had no sus-
picion of failing to obtain what he asked
for and he frankly told the full story
of his quest

  he was a difficult man to put off and
on the second day he went about reaping
the harvest he had sown the first day
so that he was able that night to take
the express back to new york

  toward the end of the second day
however he began to have an uneasy
unpleasant sense of being followed it
occurred to him at once that he might
be the object of the attentions of an
international spy though he could not
understand why he should be in face
of the fact that he had so carefully told
his whole story

  he laid simple traps for his shadow
if he should have one and was soon re-
warded by discovering a very innocent-
looking westerner always near then
being satisfied and having nothing to
conceal he went his way without fur-
ther concern

  the morning he reached new york
he was amused to find his shadow still
after him he went to his hotel in
hoboken for breakfast the food there
being satisfactory as it often is at
second-rate hotels

  he had not been at his table many
minutes when his man sauntered in


peoples

no longer a westerner but now a re-
spectable business man talbots blue
eyes twinkled

  i beg your pardon lie said as the
man passed him i think weve met
before

  the man started the least bit i-i
dont remember he said

  my names talbot

  i think youre mistaken sir

  not at all talbot was openly smil-
ing now you were a western man
yesterday dont you remember how
you followed me about from legation
to legation all over washington 

  i dont know what youre talking
about

  yes you do sit down and eat with
me do yes please do i want to
save you time and trouble ill tell you
who i am and what  was going about
for or do you know

  the man was flushed and uncertain
there was something in talbots eyes
that made discourtesy impossible and
denial difficult he tried to move away
you are mistaken was the best he
could think to say

  not in the least dont you remem-
ber how often we met yesterday do
sit down you are wasting a lot of
good time over me  have no secrets
what government do you represent
the man turned chagrin and anger
depicted on his face and left the room
without looking again at talbot the
latter laughed softly shook his head
slowly and went on with his breakfast

  i suppose he murmured that the
poor fellow must do something to jus-
tify himself good god what a
business

  with this he dismissed the matter
from his mind and went about the work
he had yet to do he must telegraph
and write to his manager get himself
clothes suitable to the conventions of
european life see mrs brookfield and
do innumerable other things some tri-
fling some important

  one of his first acts was to go to the
steamer announce his connectionwith
the shipment of horses and secure his
stateroom then as early in the day
as he thought admissible he went to
see mrs brookfield and had the sat-
isfaction on leaving her of knowing
that she was as happy as hope could
make her under the circumstances

  the last thing he did was to see colo-
nel st john and get from him his cre-
dentials and the promised letter he
slept on board that night and was up
early in the morning to look over the
horses and talk with the men who had
been engaged to take care of them

  as it came near to sailing time he
went on deck and looked about the
friends of the few passengers had gone
ashore and the usual talk was going
on between deck and dock he glanced
idly over the wharf and suddenly
smiled the man who had shadowed
him in washington and whom he had
accosted in the dining room was fur-
tively watching the vessel from the shel-
ter of a shadowed corner

  poor fool he murmured and was
turning away when his eye was at-
tracted by a man hurrying down the
wharf carrying a large box on his
shoulder there was just time for him
to give his burden to some one on board
before the gangplank was withdrawn

  somebody always comes at the last
moment said a sweet musical voice

  he turned quickly because it seemed
that the remark was addressed to him
he looked down into one of the most
beautiful faces he had ever seen it
was that of a woman who might have
been anywhere between twenty and
twenty-five

  she was evidently one of the pas-
sengers and had been leaning on the
rail watching the activity on the wharf
she smiled in a frank friendly way as
their eyes met

  yes he responded coldly
talking talbot



  i beg your pardon sir said a voice
behind him

  he turned quickly pleased with an
excuse for cutting short any conversa-
tion with the smiling beauty the
speaker was one of the men engaged
to look after the horses he was an
alert trim-looking young fellow and
had already attracted talbots notice

  a letter for you sir the man said
holding it out a man just came with
it he brought a box for you where
shall i put it

  talbot moved a few paces away and
opened the envelope the letter was
written on the paper of the club where
colonel st john stopped and when
talbot glanced at the end of the letter
he saw the colonels name signed there

  my dear talbot talbot frowned slightly
at the familiarity when i was talking to
you last night i quite forgot to speak of a
box of samples i wished to have delivered
at the commissary department i am send-
ing it by bearer and i shall be greatly
obliged to you if you will see that it is deliv-
ered to the address you will not need to take
any care of it as it contains only samples
of a few things i can get over here in case
they should be wanted by the army in
france

  what have you done with the box 
talbot demanded as he folded the let-
ter and put it in his pocket for refer-
ence

  its on the main deck

  is there any place down among the
horses where it will be safe it is for
delivery on the other side

  plenty of room in one of the feed
bunkers

  put it where it wont be lost

  yes sir

  the man went below and talbot
mainly to avoid the young woman who
had spoken to him went forward

  he was annoyed with the colonel for
the familiarity of his address and he
was annoyed with himself for being an-
noyed and yet it was certainly unlike
colonel st john who had treated him

throughout with an almost ceremonious
courtesy

  by this time the vessel was gliding
slowly out into the river hugging the
wharf closely as she went out the
groups on the wharf began to break up
and straggle away once more talbot
saw the man who had shadowed him
but this time he was with another man
to whom he was talking earnestly

  talbot looked after them smiling
and yet puzzled there was something
familiar about the second man and yet
he could not place him in his memory
he tried for a moment to do so then
dismissed the matter it seemed too
ridiculous to think about

  ridiculous as it was however his
mind continued to revert to the man
in the effort to place him aso it re-
verted to the colonels familiar address

  when he went below for lunch he
had a third trifling annoyance the
beautiful young woman sat at his right
hand he sat at the foot of the table

chapter iii

  talbot was not so silly as to be a
woman hater he had had a bitter ex-
perience once however and since then
had had no desire to know any woman
intimately

  he was sorry that this beautiful
young woman had been placed where
common decency would compel him to
be polite to her for maybe ten days
unless-and he smiled grimly-they had
bad weather and she was kept in her
stateroom

  she certainly was exceedingly beau-
tiful and it was immediately evident
that the other men on board were ready
to make up for any indifference talbot
felt for those at the only other table
watched her as much as the limits of
decency permitted while those at her
own table betrayed feverish eagerness
to make her acquaintance


peoples

  she for her part bore herself in a
friendly pleasant way with every one
but yet with a simple dignity that for-
bade familiarity she laughed easily
but softly and in a way that was a de-
light to listen to in fact talbot found
himself waiting for the low musical
ripple it was exactly such a laugh as
one might expect from the possessor
of a voice of such golden richness

  her beauty was of rather a sensuous
sort her lips full and very red-natu-
rally so talbot decided very quickly
skin milky white and running into a
shell-like pink in her round cheeks
eyes of a soft melting brown white
even teeth a round full throat

  talbot also noted that her eyelashes
were very long and dark her hair wavy
and of a lustrous brown her chin de-
liciously rounded and with a tiny but
well-defined dimple in it indeed of
dimples she had a great plenty they
were in her cheeks most adorably when
she smiled in the slightest degree they
were on her hands no doubt they
would be found at her elbows and-if
she ever wore her gowns so low-on
her shoulders

  as for her figure it did justice to her
face being exquisitely rounded without
the aid of superfluous fat all her
movements were free and graceful as
if a natural health and strength had
been supplemented by careful training
when talbot saw her on deck later
she made him think of a well-fed pan-
ther

  as his attitude toward the sex was
not a pose he did not hesitate to admit
bis pleasure in her any more than if
she had been a beautiful horse and
when he discovered as he soon did
that she paid no more attention to him
than he did to her he watched and en-
joyed her with careless frankness in
the meantime eating his lunch and leav-
ing the table as if she didnt exist

  the only other person  board who
interested him at all was the young man

who had brought him word of the box

of samples from the colonel

  this young man was a good-looking
fellow who gave the horses an eager
intelligent attention who was always
alert and always trim in appearance
he was the first to greet talbot when
the latter went down among the horses
and was always unobtrusively ready to
answer any question or to jump to a
word

  he was so constantly cheerful so
ready with his agreeable smile and at
the same time so competent that tal-
bot before the day was out had prac-
tically made him foreman over the other
men

  where did you learn about horses
he asked the young fellow

  on a ranch in montana

  and what are you going over with
these horses for its none of my busi-
ness but im interested by the way
whats your name 

  harry furness is my name he
flushed and went on unhesitatingly
it is private business that takes me
over

  pardon my question talbot said
quickly i really asked because i have
a ranch in texas and am always glad
to get hold of a good man you know
my name

  yes sir its talbot he smiled in
his engaging way they call you talk-
ing talbot he looked his admiration

  a silly name said talbot curtly
and walked away

  harry furness shrugged his shoul-
ders and watched talbot walk away a
faint odd smile curling the corners of
his mouth

  late in the afternoon they were
stopped and boarded by a british
cruiser talbot was surprised as he
had taken it for granted that it would
be known that the ship carried horses
for the british army in france

the ships papers were perfunctorily
examined and then the crew and pas-
talking talbot

sengers were examined with great care
and particularity it was then that tal-
bot learned that the beautiful young
woman was mrs frank parker of san
francisco and a widow

  the person in charge of the exami-
nation of the passengers and crew was
not a naval officer but a civilian and
he plainly knew definitely what to do

  talbot was surprised to find that he
was treated with unusual courtesy and
was scarcely questioned he immedi-
ately concluded that his mission was
known

  the other passengers were treated
with varying degrees of inquisitiveness
some being quickly dismissed and others
being questioned minutely talbot got
the impression that the inquisitor was
seeking some special person or bit of in-
formation

  mrs parker when her turn came
submitted with quiet dignity to the ques-
tioning never showing any signs of im-
patience when the man pushed his in-
quiries to an extreme even when it
looked as if the man suspected her of
being other than she asserted she did
not lose her calmness but replied
readily and placidly and occasionally
smilingly to the questions he asked her

  i guess growled a man to talbot
hes taking advantage of the situation
to talk to her

  talbot smiled i dont know he
answered thinking of the way he had
been shadowed a lot of fool things
are done these days

  id like to punch his jaw for talking
to that little woman that way said the
man talbot remembered that he had
been paying assiduous court to mrs
parker

  just then the inquisitor suddenly
ceased to question the lady and left
her with a bow that was almost pro-
found

  well said talbot with a smile it
looks as if the fellow had succumbed
to those fascinating dimples

  the other passenger broke at once
into a rhapsody over the ladys beauty
and charm to which talbot shut his
ears not being interested

  no one else on board was subjected
to the same close scrutiny as the cali-
fornia widow until talbots young
helper harry furness was reached

  his examination took precisely the
course that hers had in spite of his
engaging frankness and the readiness
of his replies to the most searching
questions the inquisition was persisted
in rudely and then suddenly dropped

  talbot had a fashion of noting small
things and putting them away in his
brain he did so in this instance puz-
zling over the matter for a few mo-
ments and then dismissing it

  the next morning when he went
down to look at the horses harry said
to him in a low tone do you know
whats in that box sir

  the one for the commissary depart-
ment

  yes sir

  it is supposed to have samples in it
i dont know what kind why do you

ask 

  i wish youd come over to where it
is before i answer you 

  harrys face was so serious that tal-
bot made no objection but went at once
with him to the feed bunker where the
box was he had seen it before but
had paid no special attention to it now
he leaned over it and examined it
closely

  suddenly he stood quite still and
hardly breathed then he turned and
looked at harry who was watching
him

  when did you discover this

  this morning it may have been
going on before but i hardly think so
im sure i would have noticed it

  there was a very faint regular tick-
ing sound coming from the box tal-
bot bent over it again his mind work-
ing rapidly and connecting together


peoples

things which before had seemed to bear
no relation to each other

  there was the man who had shad-
owed him seemingly so senselessly the
man who had been with the shadower
as the vessel moved out from the
wharf and that man was the same who
had brought the box to the boat then
the letter from the colonel the letter
with the familiar address

  whats your idea he demanded of
harry

  i thought it might be a bomb

  it is possible do you think you
could bring the captain to me at the
stern of the main deck

  shall i tell him anything

  yes say what we suspect hurry
god knows when it will go oft if it is
a bomb

  are you going- began harry

  im going to take it with me hurry
my boy 

  harry sped away his face white but
bis jaws set in a way that delighted tal-
bot who had learned to judge men

  he picked up the box and held it to
his ear the ticking was distinct and
in view of its possible meaning decid-
edly sickening nevertheless he car-
ried it with an appearance of calmness
to the stern avoiding any contact with
the persons he met by the way

  one of these was mrs parker their
eyes met and she smiled a good morn-
ing at him as they had not met at
breakfast he smiled back with more
friendliness than usual he was think-
ing how shocking it would be if that
beautiful creature were to be sent to
eternity by the explosion of the thing
he carried

  he walked swiftly but without ap-
pearance of concern and when he had
come to the stern of the boat stood
there to wait the ticking of the thing
inside the box was horribly distinct
beads of sweat broke out on his fore-
head

  the captain and harry furness came

both pale and the former greatly agi-
tated

  good god man the captain cried
huskily why dont you throw it over-
board 

   i dont know that it is dangerous

  throw it overboard i say i wont
have my ship jeopardized im respon-
sible for all these lives

   captain said talbot icily we are
wasting time if there is a bomb in
here it may go off at any moment

  then why-

  listen i have an invincible objec-
tion to making a fool of myself there
may be harmless clocks in here

 but-

  and i want you to put me into one
of your boats with tools to open this
with then we shall know-

  it shall not be opened on board of
this boat throw it overboard or i
shall call my men and have it thrown
 over

  it would take a great many of your
men to do that talbot said in a cold
even tone and the thing might go off
in the struggle besides i dont be-
lieve a man would come near me if i
said what might be in this box i am
not asking you to let me open it on
board i want you to lower me and
tow me far behind i will open the
box without danger to any one but my-
self

   get into that first starboard boat
the captain said his face convulsed with
fear and anger he turned and beck-
oned some of the sailors who were on
deck lower away the first starboard
boat there

   the tools said talbot looking at
harrj

  the latter turned and ran quickly
away talbot got into the boat to the
amazement of the men and of the group
of spectators who had been drawn by
the sight of something unusual

   talbot looking about saw that mrs
parker wras one of the group and that
talking talbot



she was studying him with a far more
puzzled expression than any of the
others

  harry returned with a hammer
chisel screw driver and a powerful
pair of nippers just as the boat reached
the water before she could be cast
loose he had slid down the pulley ropes
holding the tools in one hand

  what- began talbot at the

sight of the young man in the boat

  im going with you

  talbot started to speak then flashed
an approving glance at the other and
did not say anything

   the boat cast loose fell rapidly away
from the steamer to the end of the coil
of line by which it was to be towed
talbot held the box in his arms till the
end of the towline was reached and
the boat had taken its normal move-
ment

  the sea fortunately was smooth so
that there was not a great deal of mo-
tion there was more indeed from
the wake of the vessel than from the
waves

  talbot had been studying the box
carefully to see how it was fastened
and was ready to operate the moment
the little boat was steady enough for the
purpose

  there were a number of screws
which he took out with the screw
driver some wires which he cut with
the nippers harry silently handed him
ihe tools as he needed them

   he tried the cover but it still held
he pried it very gently it gave a little
pie looked at harry

   i dont believe it will go off by fric-
tion he said the clockwork makes
me think it will be by percussion

  thats what i think

   talbot tried again to pry off the lid
it yielded more and more having evi-
dently been held by a few blind nails

  remove it gently while i hold the
box he said to harry

  the latter put his fingers under one

end of the lid and lifted upward it
came easily and without any suspicious
sound that would have indicated pre-
arranged friction

  there was paper on top this tal-
bot carefully lifted away then the
devilish thing was fully exposed it
was an ingeniously and carefully pre-
pared time bomb

  enough dynamite there said tal-
bot to blow the ship in two the
brutes

  with steady fingers he disengaged
the connection between the explosive
and the machinery and then put the
clockwork on the bottom of the boat
leaving the dynamite in the box

  harry leaned over the side of the
boat sick at his stomach when he
sat up again talbot said it is the
motion of this small boat

  no was the response it was
fright

  oh  well i dont mind telling you
i was never so scared in my life i
never expected to get back to the
steamer he lifted his hand and sig-
naled to the captain who was at the
rail watching eagerly the boat began
to move toward the steamer pulled by
strong hands

  i think harry said talbot after
a moment of silence id like to shake
hands with you youre the bravest
man i ever met

  oh mr talbot stammered harry
his face flushed and his eyes shining
with pleasure as he eagerly reached
out and took the hand that was prof-
fered but i was terribly frightened
anybody not a fool would have
been but i dont see why you came
it wasnt necessary you know why
did you 

  the color receded from harrys face
and then rushed back again as he met
the searching glance of the keen blue
eyes he looked away and hesitated
why did you harry


peoples 

  do you think i had any unworthy
motive mr talbot he asked

  no i dont my boy but you had a
motive i know nothing about and i
am very properly curious what was
it

  the young man bit his lip and looked
away silent for a space of time tal-
bot watched him closely harry turned
suddenly and faced talbot

  i did have a motive mr talbot i
know there is no good reason for my
being here that you can see but-but
i cant tell you what it was you must
believe there was no unfriendliness to
you in it please believe that i-i
never knew a man i admired and re-
spected as much as i do you mr tal-
bot im sorry i cant tell you why i
came

  all right said talbot curtly you
dont have to

  you wont trust me any more
said harry in a troubled tone

  it must have been a powerful mo-
tive to induce you to risk your life as
you did i dont see how i shall have
any occasion to trust you i suppose
you wont do any harm to the horses

  oh mr talbot was the reproach-
ful response

  as talbot made no effort to conceal
the nature of the contents of the box
there was intense excitement on his
return the captain lirst and the pas-
sengers afterward hailed him as a hero
and were warm in their thanks to him

  dont thank me dont praise me
he said coldly theres the person who
deserves all this and he pointed to
harry he discovered the probable
nature of the box first and as you
saw he helped me open it

  w ith that he went to his stateroom
and left the young man to bear the bur-
den of praise and congratulation but
harry too escaped as soon as he could
and went below

  after that talbot treated harry with
a coolness that manifestly disturbed the

latter though he only redoubled his ex-
ertions in performing his work and in
trying to anticipate talbots wishes

  in spite of his attempt to make harry
the hero of the bomb affair however
he found himself filling that role and
it was only by coldly repelling all ef-
forts to discuss the matter with him
that he extricated himself from the dis-
comforts of it

  oddly enough the only person he
ever talked with about it was mrs par-
ker  and she perhaps was the only one
who had made no effort to discuss it
with him

  it would have been impossible to say
how an intimacy had grown up between
them since neither had made any vis-
ible effort to bring it about no doubt
almost constant propinquity had much
to do with it she was always on deck
no matter what the weather so was
he and she sat next him at table

  one day they were talking about war
and the courage it required to face
death on the battlefield she smiled at
his comment and said id like to
know how you really felt out there in
the boat when you were opening the
box

  terribly frightened

  she laughed outright you looked
as cool as ice

  oh i was cool enough i dont lose
my head very easily

  no i dont believe you do she
said looking into his eyes with an odd
expression by the way what made
you think it might be a bomb

  that was natural enough i think
even my helper-that handsome young
fellow who went out in the boat with
me-thought so at once as for me
i had good reasons i had been shad-
owed all over washington by a man
i saw that man talking to the one who
had brought the box to me and the let-
ter the man brought with the box was
a forgery
talking talbot



  nothing seems to escape you mr
talbot she said

  he shrugged his shoulders i pre-
sume i see very little but when i un-
dertake to do a thing i try to keep my
wits at work do you know why i am
going to europe

  tire faintest color rose to her cheeks
you are taking horses over for the
british government arent you

  yes but that is only incidental im
really going over to find the son of a
very dear friend then he told her
about donald

  its very interesting she com-
mented when he was through

  i dont know whether it is or not
he replied but i like the fact to be
known so that it will be plainly under-
stood that i have no political mission
you certainly havent the appearance
of a diplomat you are far too uncom-
promising she laughed

  thats exactly the impression i want
to give im going to find that boy if
hes alive and i wont be turned from
my purpose i was foolish not to un-
derstand that that man didnt shadow
me for my own sake hereafter i
shall suspect everything unusual and
keep away from it

  he looked squarely into the limpid
brown eyes as he said this mrs
parker looked back smilingly

  i think mr talbot she said that
you would make a good friend and a
bad enemy i am like that myself
he smiled and presently went below
to look at the horses

chapter iv

  one day not long before they ex-
pected to reach havre talbot was tak-
ing his customary look at the horses
when harry furness came to him and
said may i speak with you mr
talbot

  certainly

  i want to explain why i went out
in the boat with you

  the truth harry

  harry flushed yes sir the fact
that i didnt try to deceive you when
you asked me ought to show that im
not a liar

  i dont think youre a liar but on
the other hand it would have been hard
on the spur of the moment to make
up a story then you expected me to
accept your action as a part of your
readiness to serve me didnt you
yes sir

  well go ahead what do you want
to say

  i-i started on this voyage for the
sake of adventure

  i can understand that

  when you were put in charge the
men talked about you and i learned
that you were the talking talbot i
had heard so much about out in mon-
tana then i learned what you were
going over for

  how did you learn that

  you must have told somebody for
the men knew about it

  yes i believe ive been talking
talbot with a vengeance

  harry smiled about that maybe
not about anything else well when
i learned what you were going to do
i was crazy to go with you and i made
up my mind to compel you to like me
by showing you how serviceable i could
be

  you made a success of that
  thank you sir then we discov-

evered the bomb-

  when you discovered it interposed
talbot quietly

  i only suspected until you came
you seemed to know it must be a bomb
and it was the most natural thing to
think under the circumstances anyhow
it would have made the germans very
happy to have the vessel blow up with
all these horses on board


peoples

  but they reckoned without us didnt
they

 without you i wouldnt have
thought of going out in the boat
you might have been more sensible
and thrown it overboard but that
brings us to the time you went out in
the boat with me at the risk of your
life why did you do it

  it came over me while i was run-
ning for the tools that if i went with
you you would know i was one to be
depended on in a tight place

  you mean said talbot eying him
keenly that you risked your life for
the sake of inducing me to take you
with me

  yes sir

  talbot studied him for a brief while
all right i believe you

  harry sighed as if a mountain of
doubt had been lifted from his shoul-
ders and you will let me go with
you 

  thats another matter what use
can you be to me

  i can help you in a lot of ways
was the eager response i understand

french and german-

  so do i as well as i do english
i spent my childhood over here
still i can help you a great deal
there are sure to be times when you
will need help i cant exactly be valet
to you because i dont know how but
ill do anything you tell me to i
wish youd let me go with you

  there was an intensity of desire in
his voice and manner that told of an
inexpressible eagerness talbot smiled
as he listened to him

  very well he said i may be able
to use you anyhow im glad you told
me the truth

  as a result of this conversation
friendly relations were reestablished
between the two and harry showed
his happiness in the way in which he
went about his work

  the last day on the boat talbot and

mrs parker were standing together by
the rail they had stood there for many
minutes without exchanging a word
suddenly mrs parker laughed softly
he looked at her

  why do i laugh she said i was
thinking how you had changed-or
seemed to-since the first day on
board

 how

  you were so distant and forbidding
then now you and i are almost good
friends i wonder why

  the last day on board is always a
crucial time with acquaintances made
on a short voyage it is a question
whether or not they shall even nod to
each other if chance brings them to-
gether on land

  talbot looked down into the beautiful
face a faint smile on his lips he
knew that she was perfectly well aware
of the boldness of her words

  i always meet subtleties by plain
truth mrs parker he answered
with you anyhow i know that i
would be thoroughly worsted if i tried
to meet your subtleties with efforts of
my own in that line

  was i guilty of a subtlety she
asked perhaps i was i believe it
is supposed to be a womans way my
question should have been why did you
try to avoid my acquaintance when i
wanted yours time has shown that
we are suited to be friends

  i avoided you at first because you
attracted me by your very great beauty
i have distrusted myself ever since 
fell in love with a girl and believed in
her until she threw me over when i
lost my money

  what an odd man you are she
said flushing beautifully but studying
his face frankly now having said
that dont you think you could go on
and satisfy the curiosity you have
roused by saying the rest i attracted
you at first did i cease to attract
you
talking talbot



  she wasnt in the least coquettish but
was amusedly interested as he could
plainly see

  you are more attractive than ever
he answered his amusement as great
as her own but i soon saw that your
beauty was the least of your attractions
i liked the quality of your mind and i
knew that as a possible husband i had
no interest for you that is why i
even made opportunities of seeing you
am i blushing she asked

  you are

  i feel as if i were blushing from
my toes up she said i feel as if
i had been laid on a marble slab and
been dissected

  that only shows that you under-
stand all i didnt say from the little i
did say if you did you will also
understand that if the female of you
blushed the brain of you was compli-
mented

  and you dont deal in subtleties
the truth sometimes seems subtle
because it is unusual

  maybe and now to return to our
subject my object in asking my first
question was to lead up to another
before i ask it however i must as-
sure you that i shall never never try
to induce you to marry me

  i am relieved he laughed my
opinion of you is such that i would be
afraid you would win out if you under-
took even my capture ask your ques-
tion with the assurance of a fully truth-
ful answer

  she looked at him quizzically i
like to be successful in my undertak-
ings she said so that is one of the
things i would never try to do with
you my question is shall we plan
to meet again i am bold enough to
say that i would like to know you
you see being a widow i dare to
say things any other kind of woman
would not

  i should be sorry not to see you
again mrs parker he answered

      

you are a personality as well as a
woman you have a quality of positive
force new to me in your sex i feel
honored do you know where you will
be

  i shall go to paris at once i have
engaged an apartment in a very quiet
part of the old st germain quarter
i will give you the address before we
go ashore i am glad i am not to lose
sight of you besides i may be of
service to you in your quest

  really why do you think so

  i know many persons of importance
and power it is true that you carry
introductions but you know these are
peculiar times and it is possible that
ordinary influence will not suffice be
sure to let me know if you have
trouble

  he did not see her to speak to again
after that she sent him her paris
address by one of the stewards and
they waved their adieus to each other
when she went away

  his first care was to see that the
unloading of the horses was well
started then from the subordinate who
had come to take delivery of them he
procured the address of the commissary
general and went there with his intro-
duction 

  the simplest thing in the world
he was told heartily when he had stated
his wish to get to the front to inter-
view the members of donalds com-
pany come to-morrow and well
have everything read for you

  general allenby was so positive that
talbot never doubted when he went
for his permit however the general
had a long face

  ive just had word from general
french that no one with emphasis on
the no is to be permitted to go to the
front so i cant do anything for you
but you say you have good introduc-
tions to important persons in paris
go there its better anyhow for we


peoples

couldnt have promised anything for
the french lines

  not greatly chagrined by this since
it seemed of little importance talbot
waited until the horses were all safely
landed and handed over to the proper
persons and then went to paris fol-
lowed by furness who did not fail to
make himself very useful

  he put up at a hotel near the louvre
and as early in the morning as any one
was likely to be in evidence at the
government offices started out with his
letters

  at the american embassy everybody
was very cordial and very willing
everywhere else he was met with ex-
treme courtesy but many excuses he
spent several days in going about and
then one day sat down in the garden
of the tuileries to think it out

  it was perfectly plain that he was not
to be allowed to conduct his search for
donald at the front something was
working against him it wasnt that
he was asking for something impossi-
ble for he knew of two cases at least
of permission to do the very thing he
wished to do

  suddenly he remembered what mrs
parker had said to him about the pos-
sibility of his meeting with difficulties

  i had almost forgotten her he
murmured and i shouldnt have done
that

  he sat there silent motionless for
a long time then with a grim look
on his face got up and went home
harry was waiting for him

  any better luck he asked seeing
a smile on talbots face

  i think its coming out all right
at last was the response it oc-
curred to me that i hadnt tried the
department for foreign affairs so i
went there and think i shall win
through now im to see the minister
at three oclock this afternoon he
looked at his watch and i must be

off get everything ready for a quick
start

  he hurried out but when he reached
the street stopped behind a kiosk and
waited i may be mistaken he
thought but it is worth trying

  he had not been there ten minutes
when harry came swiftly out of the
hotel went to the rue de rivoli turned
to the right and disappeared talbot
went in pursuit

  harry went on to the place de la
concorde turned there and crossed to
the other side of the river

  the old st germain quarter mut-
tered talbot

  harry passed the chamber of dep-
uties and turned away from the river
all his movements were assured and
unhesitating like those of one who has
done the same thing before

 a few blocks from the river he
turned into an obscure street walked
a short distance and entered the open
gate of a courtyard talbot followed
cautiously and peered in the court-
yard was large and quite empty the
office of the concierge was at the left
in a small lodge

  i wish to see madame parker said
talbot to a stout matron who was en-
gaged in preparing vegetables for din-
ner

  she went to the door and pointed
the first door on the left she has
the entresol

  those are her windows just above
the door demanded talbot

  yes monsieur

  talbot walked close to the building
and entered the door indicated he
went up one flight with the least pos-
sible noise and stood listening for a
moment there was a murmur of
voices and he recognized both of them
he knocked at the door

  it was opened by mrs parker who
uttered a cry of surprise but did not
move to let him pass her she did put
   -

talking talbot

out her hand to him however and say
in a loud voice why mr talbot

  yes he said advancing his foot
over the threshold as he took her hand
i had something i wanted to say to
harry so i came right here

  an odd expression flashed into her
brown eyes then she laughed in the
gayest possible manner and bade him
enter standing aside to enable him to
do so

  the room was empty save for the
two of them mrs parker closed the
door and watched talbot as he searched
the room and looked at two doors that
opened out on the farther side of it

  come back harry- she called out
raising her voice slightly and seem-
ingly greatly amused he knows
youre here

  one of the doors opened slowly and
harry very white and shamed look-
ing entered the room he looked first
at the stern and slightly contemptuous
face of talbot and then at the mirthful
one of the young woman then he
stood with his eyes cast down

  sit down mr talbot said mrs
parker

  it is unnecessary he said coldly
i only came to ask harry what it
means

  im sorry mr talbot- harry

began

  mrs parker frowned and interrupted
haughtily why do you say that
theres nothing to be sorry for

  yes there is harry said in a low
tone i have lost the good opinion of
a man whose respect is worth having
i am sorry elsa

  at that note of intimacy talbot
turned his eyes quickly on her and
then back at liim

  my brother laughed she yes
theres been a deep and terrible plot
mr talbot i knew you would be dif-
ficult

ah he murmured with a smile
that was most cynical whatever you



do you do admirably i fancied it
would be so but isnt it time to en-
lighten me and let me go my way in
peace why have you taken all this
trouble with one who has no concern
with your lives

  ah she cried gayly but it is be-
cause we wish to have that concern
that we have meddled

  it is due to your meddling then
that i have been unable to advance a
step since coming here 

  entirely

  and the plot is working as you in-
tended he demanded

  not at all she responded lightly
i expected you to remember my sug-
gestion that i might be able to help
you when others failed

  i did remember

  but not as i wished i wanted you
to come to me and use my influence
and be very very grateful

  in order that- he questioned

  in order that you would in exchange
do something for me

  just a woman after all he said
with quiet scorn you prefer indi-
rection for its own sake

  no she answered without any loss
of her smiling insouciance really mr
talbot you are unjust to me but
do sit down you must see that we
have much to say to each other and
if i sit i shall be at a disadvantage
with you towering not to say glower-
ing at me so sit down and be your
eminently reasonable self

  she looked more seductively beauti-
ful than he had ever seen her the
negligee she wore showed liberal por-
tions of her white throat and bosom
and draped in revealing lines about her
rounded figure

  he did not believe there was any
premeditation in this and yet he had
come to feel that nothing was alto-
gether impossible with this very clever
woman even her gentle mockery of
him added to her piquant charm and


peoples

might be a part of her plan to win
him

  he was very suspicions but he sat
down and crossed his legs in the man-
ner of one who is prepared to be pa-
tient he was hoping to find out the
meaning of the attempt to force him
into an undesired association

  well he queried

  she seated herself laughing softly
i never saw such an interesting man
in my life she said

  youll not need me now interposed
her brother somewhat sullenly ill
go get my things if mr talbot doesnt
mind

  but i mind she cried quickly
why do you give up so soon i
am still hoping that mr talbot will
give us voluntarily the assistance i had
intended he should give involuntarily
sit down anyhow i should have a
chaperon she laughed again in her
soft musical way

  the young man sat down shrug-
ging his shoulders talbot watched
wondering how much of this was act-
ing how much real he looked in-
quiringly at the smiling woman

  you want an explanation she said

  i have no other reason for remain-
ing here you are very charming but
you dont interest me he answered
with studied rudeness

  oh truthful talbot she laughed
but you shall have your explanation
will you first tell me when you began
to suspect me of wicked designs on
you 

  willingly it was when we were
boarded by the cruiser i noticed then
that you and your brother received sim-
ilar treatment and peculiar treatment
i couldnt guess then any more than
i can now what your object was but
i decided to take your brother into my
employment so that i might find out

  curiosity is a womanish trait mr
talbot

  i am indifferent excepting as my
mission is affected

  if i could help you find your
friend she said with a sudden altera-
tion of manner would you help me
i should need to have evidence of
your power to help me and i should
need to know exactly what you wished
me to do for you was his cool re-
sponse

  you have had evidence of my power
to hinder she returned quickly

  and i have discovered the source
of hindrance come mrs parker-
if that is your name-this game of
hide and seek is as childish for you
as it is for me be as frank as you
can if i can help you and further
my own interests at the same time i
will do so but i will not be a puppet
and i will determine my own course
your silly interference hasnt done any-
thing but weary me

  you speak almost as if you wished
to make me an enemy she said in a
soft tone

  no i only wish to make it clear
to you that i am not afraid of anything
you can do if you can help me well
and good if you are only meaning to
withdraw your malign influence i may
as well tell you that i dont value it
in the least

  his tone was very icy very sarcas-
tic and it had its effect the soft
brown eyes darted a flame and the full
red lips closed tightly but that was
only for a moment when she spoke
her voice was as soft and caressing as
ever

  the more you say the more i want
your help this then is what i can
do for you i can see that you have
every facility for making inquiries
about your friend  or-she paused and
smiled with a faint air of triumph-
i will tell you at once what has be-
come of your missing friend

  you know

  yes he is-
pp

talking talbot	

  stop please understand that i
shall feel under no obligations to you
if you tell me i must see to the end
of your skein before i touch any part
of it

 o monument of suspicion o
most cautious talbot

  as you say he responded calmly

  a slight frown came and went slowly
the astute woman felt as never be-
fore that she was dealing with a man
adamant to blandishments or cunning
she smiled and took a long breath as
if entering on a new course

  your friend-dont be afraid i am
committing you to nothing-i have beeti
able to locate your friend exactly
wont you be grateful for the informa-
tion she laughed mockingly

  grateful certainly but not in-
debted

  incurable well he was taken
prisoner by one of the austrian regi-
ments then in alsace really by a hun-
garian regiment he is now in a prison
camp not very far from budapest

  thank you

  you see i have sources of informa-
tion

  i hope they are reliable

  incorrigible she laughed again
but i will put you in the way of ob-
taining assurance of the reliability of
this i can do more i can make it
possible for you to obtain the freedom
of your friend

  now you are most interesting i
suppose it is this that i am to pay
for in some way

  yes and a small price

  you are not to be the judge of my
estimate of the cost what am i to
do

  the brother and sister exchanged
glances betraying that they felt they
had come to the crucial spot in the
negotiations

  it is essential that we get to buda-
pest all we ask of you is to take us
there with you

  talbot knew he was being watched
now with anxious scrutiny his face
was like a mask in its impassivity he
realized that in some way this was a
game of wits why or wherefore he
could not guess

 and why do you ask me to take
you there i have no influence i am
an american as you are americans
you can enter austria and hungary as
easily as i

  we are not americans we are hun-
garians

  you have american passports they
brought you safely to paris

  by themselves they would not get
us into hungary except to put us be-
hind iron doors

  how could i get you in

  as your servant my brother could

get in and i- she hesitated and

her brother got up and went to the
window

  and you talbot prompted

  she lifted her lovely head with
haughty pride i would ask you to
take me in as your wife

  the ghost of a smile passed over
talbots face hers went white as she
noted it he shook his head slowly

  it would be too much honor he
said

  you mean you refuse she snapped
a new note of passion in her wonderful

voice

  you are conspirators are you not
he asked

  what we are is not your concern
once we are in budapest you will see
us no more

  talbot rose to his feet you are
so far right he said coldly that who
or what you are is no concern of mine
therefore i wish to have nothing to do
with your enterprises i have set out
to find and if possible to take home with
me donald brookfield i am interested
in nothing else he moved toward
the door

  one moment she snapped her eyes


peoples

flaming her whole attitude threatening
i have told you i could help you to
free your friend

  yes you have said so also you
have said things that convince me that
i dont wish to associate with you i
will work alone

  you fool you fool you self-
sufficient fool she broke out in a rage
that was all the more impressive be-
cause it was so deadly quiet because
you have been a successful bully and
gun lighter you think you can stalk
through europe in the same way
he smiled this time in sheer amuse-
ment he studied her in her passion
of anger and thought her more than
ever beautiful

  why didnt you pick out a more
susceptible man he asked carelessly
you certainly arc marvelously beauti-
ful

  the young man at the window had
turned now he spoke for the first time
his face was livid i think youd bet-
ter go mr talbot he said in a tone
hoarse with suppressed emotion i
wouldnt like you to insult my sister
i have no intention of doing so
talbot answered quickly but evenly
but i dare you to deny that it was
her intention to win my acquiescence
through her beauty

  go said the angry beauty and
i warn you to beware how you cross
my path keep what you know or
suspect to yourself your life will be
blown out like a used match at the
first suggestion of loose talk from you
highly melodramatic talbot said
with a smile and passed out of the
room

chapter v

  talbot walked slowly away from the
house he didnt doubt that he had
been wise to refuse to be drawn into
the scheme whatever it was it might
be that the plotters would have been
able to help him they certainly had

hindered him but his judgment told
him that he had acted wisely

  the question now was whether to
go on without further thought of them
or to try to figure out first what the
extent of their power was and so be
in a position to elude it

  there was young hopkins at the em-
bassy he would be the one to advise
him he not only knew the ins and outs
of european politics but he had been
a friend of donalds and therefore
would be interested in the matter

  hopkins was yawning over a long
dispatch which he had just finished
putting into cipher when talbot was
shown in

  wait till  seal this and well have
a cigarette together the attache said
briskly any luck 

 thats what ive come to talk
about and then when they were
settled in easy-chairs with cigarettes
he told the story of his connection
with the brother and sister down to
the moment

  in his interest hopkins let his ciga-
rette go out he asked very few ques-
tions for though brief talbot was ex-
plicit when he had finished he sank
back in the chair and eyed the other
phew whistled the attache

  do you understand it demanded
talbot

  surest thing you know ejaculated
hopkins who in his expatriation loved
to use all the slang he could revo-
lution thats what

  revolution where in hungary
yes dont breathe it but weve
been getting information right along
that there is a big plot under way to
separate the two kingdoms while all
this turmoil is on just how it is to
be done we dont know we do know
though that the allies are deeply in-
terested in all the disturbances that will
make things difficult for their enemies
that would account for the ladys
ability to thwart my inquiries
talking talbot



  sure thing as for the lady herself

no doubt shes the countess- but

theres no need to give you her name
shes the center of the work in amer-
ica and from all accounts is a little
dynamo so shes over here look
here if i were you id steer clear
of those people if you got in their
way they wouldnt consider you any
more than you consider the insect you
unconsciously crush as you walk
through the woods theres a king-
dom in question you see

  well it looks silly to me said tal-
bot it looks like playing preten-
tiously an impossible game

  because of the pretty woman in it
youre way off my friend if the
woman in question is the one i think
shes as ruthless and as clever as the
most hardened conspirator you ever
heard of women why bless your
heart they are at the bottom of every
successful revolution the world has ever
seen dont make the mistake of de-
spising her whatever else you do in
such a matter she isnt a woman but
only a conspirator

  what credence do you put in what
she said about donald being in hun-
gary

  none its six and half a dozen
fifty-fifty theyre saying now arent
they he laughed in appreciation of
the new bit of slang but say he
cried with sudden recollection one
of our american boys has come back
from the front slightly wounded hes
in the american hospital go see him
hell know whether or not don was
taken by the austrians and say do
keep out of countess-that womans
way

  do you think id have been wiser
to take up with her proposition

  not on your life even if shes
telling the truth now she wouldnt hes-
itate to sacrifice you and donald with
you the moment it was to the advan-
tage of their plot here he scrib-

bled on a blank card this is the
name of the young fellow in the hos-
pital tell the doctor you come from
me oh another thing get a move
on as soon as you can

  talbot went first to the hospital it
was on the other side of the river and
the day was slipping away but the
metro took him there in a few minutes
and when he arrived a few urgent
words to the physician in charge gained
him his interview

  the young fellow had nothing worse
the matter with him than a bullet in
his arm and a broken bone so he
talked readily he confirmed the story
of being opposed by austrian troops
at the time of donalds disappearance
that was all he knew but it was enough
to satisfy talbot that he couldnt do
better than hurry on to hungary and
there investigate the prisoners camps

  after some hesitation he went to a
cable office and sent a message to mrs
brookfield reason to believe don-
ald prisoner in hungary he had de-
cided to give her that much comfort

  then he went to his hotel to eat and
plan for departure it was evident the
moment he entered his room that harry
had been there for his clothes after
a few moments he saw a note stuck
in the frame of the mirror

  dear mr taibot whatever you may
now think of me i must tell you that my
feeling for you remains the same dont
judge me too harshly until you know all the
circumstances as you may some day you
are threatened i know that in your supreme
courage you will be tempted to disregard the
threat dont there is real danger to you
a woman may be beautiful and yet implac-
able by the way the information concern-
ing your friend is absolutely correct be-
ware from this moment	h f

  umph grunted talbot i wonder
if that lovely creature is really the
tigress they would make her out
countess somebody and he a count
well there is a little melodrama left
in life anyhow


peoples

  me dined and then went hunting for
hopkins to report his success and to
hasten arrangements for his departure
for hungary the next day passports
and money matters had to be looked
after and letters of introduction ob-
tained

  he found the attache at last and
having made him acquainted with the
new developments arranged with him
to get things started as early in the
morning as possible

  it was late when he returned to his
hotel and he was prepared to enjoy a
nights rest the hotel was one of the
small old-fashioned sort but very com-
fortable talbot had his first really
restful night since reaching paris

  as he sat over his coffee and rolls
in the morning he took stock of the
situation he found himself in his first
and instinctive feeling had been not to
take the lovely countess seriously and
even now he might have dismissed her
as a mere spectacular incident if he
alone had been concerned since his
mission was to rescue donald if alive
he decided to pay the threatening beauty
the compliment of running away from
her as quickly as possible

  she might or might not be able to
do something to him once he was in
hungary but at any rate he would get
there first and be through with his task
before she could reasonably hope to get
there

  he met with no delays as he went
about and even when his needs took
him into the various government offices
where he had met with wearisome diffi-
culties before he now found everybody
ready and even eager to give him all
the assistance he needed and even to
suggest some things that he had not
thought of

  thus he was advised to go across
switzerland and the way made easy
by passes and recommendations  he was
put in the way of obtaining all he
wanted of austrian money of all sorts

in fact as if sorry for the delays pre-
viously spread out before him every-
body moved to assist him with smiling
alacrity

  this kindness seemed on the whole
as suspicious as the previous policy of
hindrance had been so when his busi-
ness with the various departments was
all transacted he went to hopkins to
ask his opinion

  the change of route involved his
remaining one night more in paris
anyhow so he could take the time to
talk the matter over with his sophis-
ticated friend

  i wouldnt bother you ordinarily
he said by way of preface but this
storybook business of a plot with a
kingdom for a prize and a woman flam-
ing threats at me and a young diplomat
full of mystery have ended by making
me suspicious of everything

  hopkins laughed youll be lucky
if its never any more than a joke to
you ive been able to confirm my sus-
picion that the countess is here with
her brother and that she represents
the hungarian revolutionists in amer-
ica she has brought over a huge sum
of money and there is an inside but
ostensibly unofficial movement of the
allied governments to give her all the
aid they can

  youre sure of that

  positive

  then she is dangerous and id bet-
ter get away from here the soonest
possible

  thats my notion of it you see
hungary is bent on having a govern-
ment of her own and now seems their
best chance i have private informa-
tion that the allies are promising every
help to that end if the new government
of hungary will throw in its lot with
them all the fighting isnt being done
in the trenches you see now for your
story

  talbot told all that he had done and
talking talbot



how he had been helped where pre-
viously he had been hindered

  i confess i dont like the looks of
it said hopkins shaking his head and
frowning why should you be given
such generous assistance with the
letters you have to austrian officials
in addition to the help the french gov-
ernment has given you to get to aus-
tria  then your letters to swiss officials
say have you been followed about since
youve been here

  i have been to-day but it seemed
too silly to pay any attention to

  silly do you know that the papers
you carry would be a great help to any-
body wanting to slip into austria ill
bet those plotters know everything you
carry

  much good may it do them
hopkins looked him over approv-
ingly youd put up a good tight all
right but say i f everybodys been
fitting you out so carefully to get into
austria its because its important that
somebody should have just that equip-
ment now youre an american and
everybody who is at all interested knows
just what your business is you can
get what no one else could

  you mean they intend to use me
as a cats-paw

  i dont say so positively but any-
how its sure that you carry papers that
would be useful to a hungarian revo-
lutionist who wanted to get into hun-
gary

  yes thats sure but im not going
to give them up

  do you know said the attache seri-
ously that i think it would be a wise
thing for you to stay with me to-night
ill send for your luggage and you
can start the first thing in the morn-
ing

  well answered talbot after a
pause maybe i would be wise to stay
with you but somehow i want to find
out what im really up against i be-
lieve ill go to my hotel

  youre armed

  always

  well for heavens sake keep out
of trouble said hopkins shaking his
hand warmly and inwardly congratu-
lating himself that he was not in tal-
bots place

  the streets were dark when talbot
went into them lights had been few
and far between since the days when
the fear of zeppelins had fallen on
paris to make matters worse there
were no taxis to be had and there was
a fine rain falling

  talbot stood for a while in the door-
way giving his eyes time to become ac-
customed to the darkness when he
started on his homeward way he lis-
tened for footsteps behind him and
occasionally glanced swiftly behind
him

  he had gone half a dozen blocks be-
fore he was satisfied that he was be-
ing followed then he turned a corner
suddenly and waited a while then as
suddenly went back as he had come
a small man with upturned collar al-
most ran into him

  three times talbot did this with the
same result the last time he stopped
in front of the man having contrived
this time to have the meeting under a
light

  im going to my hotel he said get-
ting in the mans way will you go
with me it will save you such a lot
of trouble

  the little man snarled something in-
articulate and was for passing talbot
but the latter put out a restraining arm

  no but come then he said quietly
you have been going my way all day
lets walk together at last we can
talk then

  you are crazy the other snapped
he spoke his french like a foreigner
i dont know you i dont want to
know you

  you are foolish to waste so much
time following me then talbot said
	peoples

quietly if you continue to do so you
may know me without wishing to i
assure you  am going straight to my
hotel so good night to you

  the man went away quickly as soon
as talbot moved and it seemed from
the sounds lie made that he was stran-
gling talbot laughed

  how funny these spies are he
thought they become so angry when
they are found out

  so far as he knew he wasnt followed
any farther he was wary in passing
particularly dark spots but saw noth-
ing at any time to make him feel that
danger lurked along his way

  ever since he had lived in the open
spaces of the west it had seemed to
him that he was very sensitive to un-
friendly presences more than once this
sixth sense of his had served him well
so that he had come to have faith in
it and to feel sure now that excepting
for the spy there had been nothing evil
or threatening on the streets

  he took his key from the clerk
asked that his bill should be ready early
in the morning and went upstairs

  it was between ten and eleven oclock
-a time when paris hotels are at their
quietest talbot took it for granted
that now that he was in the hotel he
had no need for caution and yet he
wtas cautious

  ide went softly along the corridor to
his room listening intently and half
laughing at himself these revolution-
ists have given me the willies he
thought 

  at his door he stopped and listened
again before he put the key in the lock
there wasnt a sound to be heard and
yet he was uneasy he took a small
quick-firing revolver from his side
pocket and held it in his right hand
while he unlocked the door with his
left

  his room was pitch dark and still
and yet talbot could have sworn there
was some one in there he squatted

low and putting his fingers on the
electric button by the side of the door
turned it staring into the room ready
to see what was there

  the light didnt come he was sure
now that some one was there pie
didnt believe for a moment that some-
thing was out of order with the switch
except as it had purposely been made
so

  he decided quickly he might have
slipped out and gone downstairs for a
light and assistance he preferred
some risk and to have the whole affair
in his own hands

  somethings gone wrong with the
light he said audibly but as if think-
ing aloud ill have to turn it on
at the bulb

  he closed the door and made sev-
eral deliberate steps toward the center
of the room then seemed to hesitate
as if seeking the bulb in the darkness
in reality he was listening a faint
sound came to his ears from just in
front of him

  confound the thing where is that
bulb oh here it is

  as he spoke he leaped lightly back-
ward and crouched down it happened
as he had expected-a sudden rush and
a blow that smashed the bulbs on the
electrolier and he was aware that
there were two persons besides himself
in the room

  if either of you moves a step ill
shoot he said in a tone that was cold
and hard

  at the sound of his voice the two
intruders flung themselves in that direc-
tion instead of shooting as he had
threatened he closed his hand over the
barrel of the revolver and hooked in
boxing parlance taking the chance of
landing

  he rose as he delivered the blow
and knew instantly that he had had the
good fortune to land on the face of
one of his assailants the other one
fell against him and they grappled
talking talbot



  the tussle was sharp and short it
would have needed a veritable hercules
to hold his own with chester talbot
in a mere trial of strength in this
case talbot didnt hesitate to use the
butt of his pistol freely with the re-
sult that the man sank limp and groan-
ing to the floor

  as he had been free from any attack
by the first man he hail struck he took
it for granted that he was disabled
he felt rapidly about and found that
both men were stretched on the floor
instantly he struck a match and looked
at them they were only semiconscious
if that

  another lighted match showed him
that the bulbs on the electrolier were
all out of commission he turned to
the light that stood at the head of his
bed it was intact he turned it on
and then stood to take breath and view
the battlefield

  both men were covered with blood
but were not seriously hurt and were
recovering consciousness he used
their own handkerchiefs to bind their
wrists with he noted as he used them
that they were of fine silk and faintly
scented the men were not ordinary
ruffians then

  a glance about the room showed that
his effects had been thoroughly
searched he smiled grimly and set
about a search of their pockets and
clothes generally

  he found nothing that interested him
excepting a box of his own visiting
cards and several business letters ad-
dressed to him he smiled as he real-
ized that they had come for what he had
on his person-the letters of introduc-
tion the passport the money perhaps
and the notes he had made from time
to time

  there was nothing on them to give
him any clew to their names or nation-
ality though of the latter he had little
doubt even with the blood on their
faces they were unmistakably hun-

garians that is he assumed so under
the circumstances

  the first man struck and the one
least injured was now recovering rap-
idly so talbot used some stout twine
he had to secure his feet first and then
those of the other man

  after that he washed away the blood
with a wet towel so that he would have
a chance to see their faces properly
when they recovered this done he
lighted a cigarette and waited

  when the first man had recovered
consciousness fully talbot helped him
to a sitting posture with his back
against the wall the man scowled
but was silent talbot smiled at him

  presently the other man came to and
was treated in a similar way the two
men looked at each other and then
fiercely at talbot he was the first
to break the silence

  i am assuming gentlemen that you
are hungarian patriots i know you
are gentlemen by your conduct and i
guess you are hungarians am i cor-
rect

  one of the men the second one to
go down growled incoherently and
looked at the other by reason of which
talbot took the latter to be the one
of greater authority it was that one
who answered him

  what are you going to do he de-
manded with a haughtiness that was
ludicrous under the circumstances tal-
bot thought

  i dont know he answered slowly
i dont know what is best to do you
annoy me exceedingly and i might
turn you over to the police a flash
of joy lighted up the mans face tal-
bot noted it and went meditatively on
but i dont believe  will i am more
disposed to send for the american am-
bassador ah i see that is distasteful
to you i propose then that we have
an amicable discussion what do you
say

  what do you want to discuss


peoples

  to begin with am i right in sup-
posing you to be hungarian revolution-
ists

  we are hungarians

  why have you been here searching
my things and assaulting me 

  i must leave the answer to that ques-
tion to your own imagination

  then we will consider your answer
to be that i have some articles of value
to you in your revolutionary activities
now dont you think you are not
merely unreasonable in acting toward
me as you do but even ridiculous

  t think you would better decide to
do something with us and do it- was
the petulant response

  even the american ambassador
would you like america to get busy
and keep all hungarians in the united
states you know that might happen
if your revolution were thoroughly
aired and i have the influence to see
that it does happen

  the man bit his lip the other man
muttered an expletive in what talbot
took for hungarian

  now said talbot with a grimness
that was made impressive by the cold
evenness of his tone i am tired of
your silly attentions to me if i have
any feeling about your revolution it is
one of sympathy but above everything
else i want to fulfill my mission over
here you know what that is for i
have taken extraordinary pains to make
it known i wont meddle with you if
you leave me alone but if you insist
on your dime-novel melodramatic and
altogether asinine methods of treating
me i promise you you will repent it
have i made myself clear

  what do you want me to say the
man asked

  good god am i to tell you what
to say you know whether or not you
understand me

  i understand you

  will you undertake to convince that

absurd countess that we are living in
the world and not in a storybook

  the mans face grew purple with
anger i will undertake nothing you
will do with us what you please and
you will take the consequences no
harm has been meant you and none
would be done you if you had been
or would yet be reasonable

  you mean consent to be your pup-
pet demanded talbot with such con-
temptuous scorn that the other ground
his teeth together what a pack of
idiots you are

  without another word he got up and
stretched the two men out on the floor
side by side placing the subordinate
across the doorway so that the door
could not be opened without pushing
him out of the way the other man
he adjusted close to him but with his
head to the heels of the other

   expect you to lie as placed he
said sharply im going to bed

  he looked to the fastenings of their
ankles and wrists and reenforced the
latter with twine then he bound the
arm of one to a leg of the other

  youll not be very comfortable he
said as he undressed calmly but at
least youll be better off than i would
have been if you had found me as easy
as i found you

  what do you mean to do the
spokesman demanded

  you will discover that when i do
it i am still ready to discuss my lack
of connection with your silly revolution
but i prefer not to waste words with
you i may say though that i dont
think much of your chances if you and
your absurd countess are fair samples
of the other leaders

  the two men on the floor talked to-
gether jn a language unknown to talbot

  you know he said quietly i shall
gag you if you dont stop talking i
want to sleep

  both men swore there could be no
doubt of that even if what they said
talking

talbot



was unintelligible the fact was that
talbot could have done nothing to dis-
turb them as his matter-of-fact prep-
arations for sleep had done

  if we promise not to interfere with
you again will you let us go the
leader asked

  youve lost your chance to make
terms my revolutionary hero talbot
answered with a sarcasm that made
the man writhe im sleepy now in
the morning i may decide to talk with
you i dont know

  talbot after putting out the light
and opening his window knowing that
the men could not do anything without
awakening him got into bed knowing
himself to be a light sleeper and closed
his eyes at last

  he slept soundly and peacefully and
when morning came got up and dressed
as if the men were not there the
leader spoke to him several times but
talbot went about his toilet whistling
softly as if he were quite alone

  finally the man desisted and talbot
finisheddressing and packing for con-
venience in traveling he had only one
large bag

  when he was quite ready he took
some towels and set about gagging
both men in spite of their fierce prot-
estations

  what you think doesnt interest
me he said in his grim way i am
not going to hurt you or make you any
more uncomfortable than i can help
but i am going to arrange so that you
wont be disturbed till noon anyhow
by that time i shall be far on my way
perhaps i had better tell you that you
have seen me in a mild a very mild
mood if you will take my advice-
though i think you are much too big a
fool to do it-you will not meddle with
me again and say its none of my
business but why dont you get a man
to take charge of your revolution
youll never get anywhere with that
absurd countess who evidently got all

her irlcas out of the balkan romances
she has read

  what the men might have answered
to this talbot neither knew nor cared
they were gagged and speechless and
he was ready to go

  he locked the door on the outside
then found the man in charge of that
floor and gave him his bag to carry
downstairs

  i left a friend asleep in my room
he said to the man slipping a five-franc
piece into his hand dont disturb
him until after noon

  no monsieur

  ill give the key to the patron when
i pay my bill so you must let him out
some time after noon will you

  yes monsieur

  talbot paid his bill publicly tipped
everybody in sight including the man
already tipped got into the old moth-
eaten hack that had been brought out
to take the place of the taxi autos
requisitioned for the army and was
driven to the gare de lyons

chapter vi

  it was with no small satisfaction that
talbot found himself one day estab-
lished in one of budapests best hotels

  he had gone first to vienna where
he had used his credentials to such
good purpose that he had been fur-
nished with other letters to the proper
persons in budapest he felt that
his search for donald was nearing an
end and he hoped a successful one

  he had told the people at the amer-
ican legation of his experience with the
hungarian revolutionists in paris and
they had not only taken his story very
seriously but had urged him to hurry
through with what he had to do and
above all things to say nothing about
it unless he wanted to find himself
mixed up in it in spite of himself

  there really is something in it he
asked


peoples

  the whole of hungary is ripe for
a rupture with austria he was told
if the hungarians were only united
it would be a matter of days only as
it is there arc two claimants for the
throne and a strong minority that fa-
vors a republic

  and my little countess

  your little countess is the most dan-
gerous of the lot she has been an
exile for a number of years and has
spent her time gathering men and
money in america she is in favor of
a return to the old regime-the nearest
representative of the ancient reigning
house

   thought said talbot she might
be meaning to mount the throne her-
self

  you think it a joke was the quick
response but let me tell you that if
the man she favors is put on the throne
she will undoubtedly be his queen
and to think laughed talbot that
i have had the honor of familiar inter-
course with her

  steer clear of them all his ad-
viser urged the three parties are
at war among themselves we got
word a day or two ago that the other
claimant to the throne had disappeared
and it is suspected that she has met
with foul play poor child

  child queried talbot with mild
interest

  a girl im told shes an unwilling
participant but it seems she has a few
drops of the very oldest simon-pure
strain of blood royal in her veins and
has been dragged into the affair
shes part slav interposed one of
the attaches who had been listening
and that is supposed to make her de-
sirable as likely to reconcile the slavic
part of hungary however shes done
for now if the magyar party has her
shes not likely to bother anybody for
long

  well said talbot with a sort of

disgust i thought the hungarians
were a fine people

  fine was the general outcry
nothing better in the world nothing
better than the hungarian people
were not talking of them but of the
ruling class the ruling class the world
over is rotten and despicable to the last
degree the hope is that in the end
the people will come into their own
well said talbot they have my
best wishes in the meantime im busy
with just one thing and nothing will
divert me from it

  budapest has the reputation of be-
ing the gayest city in the world and
the naughtiest and when talbot found
himself set down there where only a
short time before he had not dreamed
of being he might have indulged a per-
fectly justifiable curiosity to explore it

  it was as gay and bright as ever it
had been even though the russian army
threatened from the carpathians but it
held nothing seductive for talbot he
was intent on finding donald so that
he might send the good word to the
waiting mother in america

  he presented his letters at the head-
quarters of the military governor and
was received with a courtesy that al-
most revived the suspicions he had had
in paris

  when he was shown in to see the
governor however he quickly forgot
his suspicions in face of the prompt-
ness and frankness of his treatment by
him

  you are seeking a friend among our
prisoners i believe said the governor

  a young american who enlisted in
the french army

  tell me all about it please

  talbot told his well-rehearsed story
refraining carefully from any reference
to his difficulties the governor asked
a few questions all of which talbot
answered

  what made you think he might be
here the governor demanded
talking talbot



  talbot explained that he bad been
captured by the austrian troops which
at that time were in alsace

  was he wounded

   dont know

  it would make it easier to free him
but no matter it shall be arranged
somehow once you find him

  he rang a bell explained the situa-
tion to the young aid who came in
response and bade him prepare the
necessary permits and passes to enable
talbot to search the detention camp

  you see he said we have but the
one camp here you will have some
difficulty in reaching it but with money
you can accomplish it no doubt this
young gentleman will give you all the
information you require kindly re-
port to me when your search is over
you understand that i am promising
nothing more than that i will do my
best for you

  when his highness says that
laughed the young officer when they
were outside it is as good as done

  at any rate the plainly manifested
good will of the governor made smooth
sailing for him everybody helped him
frankly and freely so that the next
morning saw him making his way to
the camp

   it was quite fifty miles from the city
and was reached by a slow journey by
rail for part of the distance and by
any conveyance he might get for the
remainder

  it was still early in the afternoon
when he reached the village that was
nearest to the camp but he found that
by the time lie could get to the camp
some three miles distant it would be
too late for him to gain admittance

  he had so far seen nothing in the
nature of a spy and therefore felt
reasonably secure from the interference
that had annoyed him so in paris

  almost everybody spoke german so
he had no difficulty as a consequence
of not understanding hungarian the

head of the village with great solem-
nity had interviewed him at once 
his arrival and had retired bowing pro-
foundly to the combination of author-
ity from the military governor a hand-
ful of gold and avowed american
citizenship

  the american gentleman was wel-
come to the best the village afforded
a conveyance should be ready for him
in the morning to take him to the de-
tention camp in the meantime there
were the paths in the forest and by the
banks of the little river where he was
most welcome to walk no doubt if
his highness the prince of something
unpronounceable were at home he
would welcome the stranger at the cas-
tle as it was the gentleman might find
the exterior of the old castle worth
looking at

  the suggestion of a walk in the noble
forest near by struck talbot as a very
good one and he had no sooner washed
the dirt of travel from his hands and
face than he set out

  the few people he saw-mostly old
men and females of all ages-were not
disposed to be friendly or perhaps
they did not understand german out-
side of the villages at any rate the
workers in the fields only looked up
and stared in response to his greetings
and then went on with their work

  an hours sauntering walk through
the wonderful forest brought him to a
vast open space at the farther side
of which rose a great castle flanked
on each side by a high and apparently
massive wall

  it was plainly a very very old struc-
ture though in perfect repair and in
the days long past must have been a
formidable fortress the romance in
talbot made him feel that he would like
to explore the interior of it but it was
so plainly in use that he dismissed the
idea

  he even refrained from approaching
any nearer lest his presence should an-


peoples

noy the inmates wishing however
to get some idea of the size of the place
he kept at the edge of the woods and
started to skirt the wall

  he neither saw nor heard a human
sound and if it had not been for the
smoke coming out of some of the chim-
neys he would have believed it unin-
habited

  the wall stretched on and on for-
bidding and insurmountable by ordinary
means nothing less than a good lad-
der would have enabled any one to
climb up and look over it

  he passed two doors in the wall
both were of recent date and of oak
bound with wrought-iron straps later
he came upon a small door of open
ironwork but very heavy

  he could not resist the impulse to
look through the bars to get a glimpse
of the grounds hidden by the great
wall he was obliged to stoop in order
to do so

  for a few seconds he was conscious
only of looking into a small inclosure
which had once been a garden but
which now bore not only the blight of
a cold november but of years of neg-
lect a small stone cottage stood in
the midst of the garden and beyond
stretched the well-kept grounds of the
castle

  for a few moments he studied the
scene in wonder then he became aware
of a human occupant of the garden
and flushing with shame he stammered
in german i-i beg your pardon i
-f-im a stranger

  much chagrined at having been de-
tected in so undignified a proceeding
he was hurrying away when a soft voice
called out in tones of mingled terror
and entreaty dont go please come
back

  he turned back and looked again
through the grating ready to make the
most abject of apologies but saying
nothing

  a simply but richly dressed young

woman stood in plain sight in an at-
titude of fear her hands tightly clasped
in front of her her lips parted her
eyes wide open

  in spite of her manifest terror it
seemed to talbot he had never seen
so lovely a creature as this her slen-
der but well-rounded figure and the
firm fresh lines of her exquisite face
indicated that she was about twenty
years of age

  i am very sorry he said earnestly
i didnt mean to frighten you i am
a stranger and was walking about the
castle

  you are a stranger she demanded
in a low tone glancing furtively around
yes an american

  oh-li she breathed and softly
moved toward him her great gray eyes
studying his face not a hungarian
oh no an american

 she approached closer and the
nearer she came the more wonderful
she seemed in her pure sweet beauty
you are not deceiving me she asked
with a pathetic quiver of her sensitive
lips

  i give my word of honor he an-
swered why should i deceive you
what reason would i have

  she came to within three feet of the
grated door her little hands clinging
tightly to each other her eyes search-
ing his face but all the while she
seemed to be listening intently and to
be moving softly so that she might hear
the better

  you look honest she whispered
are you in trouble do you need
help

  she wrung her hands if i could
only be sure

  you may trust me he said with
a fervor that he wondered at himself
i never betrayed a trust in my life
do you need help

  i am a prisoner here she breathed
and-and i am afraid

  who keeps you a prisoner what
talking talbot



for demanded talbot instinctively
trying the door to see if it could be
forced open

  oh  dont know if i dare to speak
-to tell you

  who are you he asked

  i am afraid she half sobbed oh
why did they drag me into this i
didnt want it

  i wish you would trust me he
pleaded his heart torn by her distress
i will never betray you and i will
help you

  im such a coward she wailed
softly im not fit for this sort of
thing if they had only left me where
i was

  if you would only tell me something
that would enable me to help you
pleaded talbot more moved than he
remembered ever to have been

  she looked fearfully about and crept
close to the grating i am the prin-
cess sonia she whispered and then
clapped her little hand to her lips terri-
fied lest she had made a fatal mistake

  talbot looked puzzled the prin-
cess sonia he repeated softly but
what have you done that you should be
imprisoned 

  you dont know she cried a new
light of hope leaping to her eyes
you really are a stranger then

  i reached budapest yesterday for
the first time in my life i am here
to rescue an american boy who is a
war prisoner in the camp near here
on my honor you can trust me

  she reached out eagerly and put her
soft little hand on his as it clung to
the bar of the door he shivered and
grew weak at the touch it was the
most extraordinary sensation he had
ever felt

  oh she breathed i wonder if you
can help me i had lost all hope i
am so afraid you see-she lowered
her voice so that he could hear her
only by putting his face so close to
the bars that he could feel her warm

     

breath on his cheek-they wanted to
make me head a revolution and be-
come- her voice trailed off to

nothing she was afraid to utter the

words

  now i understand talbot cried
you are the poor little girl the count-
ess elsas party kidnaped

  the countess elsa isnt here the
princess gasped in fright dont say
she is here yet

  i dont think she is i left her in
paris

  you know her you are a friend
of hers and the poor child crept
away from him in horror

  no not a friend he answered re-
assuringly indeed i think she is very-
near to hating me

  oh she said softly and drew
closer again do you think she will
be here soon

  i dont know i suppose she will
come as quickly as she can

  they are keeping me for her the
princess said staring at him

  you mean she is to decide what-

he couldnt put into words a thought
that seemed so monstrous

  the princess nodded her head slowly
what to do with me she said in
completion of his phrase and i know
what it will be

  he dared not ask her he recalled
the countess and remembered what he
had heard about her he couldnt be-
lieve the frightful suggestion that lay
in the low-spoken words of the princess
however

  i dont believe shes as hard as they
say he contrived to murmur

  she wants to be queen herself the
princess whispered she will be mar-
ried to the duke you know there was
a plan to marry me to the duke that
is why i was stolen away and brought
here

  do you love the duke demanded
talbot understanding that he must be
the pretender to the throne


peoples

  i cant bear him but they would
have made me marry him you know
you see it doesnt matter about me
 have to do what im told but thats
all over now the countess elsa wont
let me be in her way as long as i
live she added piteously they think
im a menace and all i want is to
live in humble obscurity i was never
born to be a queen it was so un-
reasonable to want to make me be one
have you no friends he demanded
i mean is there any one i could ap-
peal to for you

  what could they do she answered
hopelessly the countess elsas party
is the most powerful the leaders of
my party must know where i am but
they have done nothing

  will you let me help you he asked
but-she stared at him eagerly-
what can you do

  i dont know but if you will trust
me i will do my best to get you away
from here and out of the country
oh could you do you think you
could i would be safe in russia i
am half russian you know but-
and her head drooped sadly-you are
alone you say you can do nothing
will you let me try

  he took one of her little hands in
his and held it she looked into his
eyes as if fascinated

  you give me courage she said in
a tone of surprise but i dont want
you to get into trouble

  never mind about me tell me you
will trust me and let me try to get you
away from here

  you know you will be risking your
life she murmured they would kill
you if they saw you now talking to
me why should you take such a
chance for me

  do you suppose i could be happy
if i did not try to help you come
that is settled have you any sugges-
tions

  about escaping oh no i have

thought of everything but nothing was
worth while you can see how secure
they feel when they let me out here
the first day they made me stay in the
cottage

  are you locked in at night

  yes

  and is no one about in the day-
time  can no one see or hear us 

  there wont be anybody here till-

oh some one is coming now go
go quickly 

  to-morrow at this time be here
he said drawing back

  yes yes  and she turned her back
on him

  he waited by the side of the gateway
long enough to hear the rough voice
of a man address the princess in hun-
garian and to hear her reply in the same
tongue then quickly and silently he
went on

  it was hard for him to realize that
such things as he had just been hearing
of could be true but the sight of the
suffering princess sonia and her cer-
tainty that she was facing death de-
prived the plot of the comic-opera effect
it had theretofore had for him

  and sonia the girl herself appealed
to him with her helplessness her gen-
tleness and for her piteous unfitness
for the role she had been called on to
play

  but how was he to help her what
could he do there alone an utter
stranger knowing nobody ignorant
even of the language of the people

  suddenly as he strode swiftly along
he remembered donald up to that
time he had forgotten him completely
evidence of his absorption in the trou-
bles of the princess

  how was he to reconcile the two
tasks he was pledged to find and
free donald if possible he had pledged
himself to succor the princess and even
if he had not pledged himself he would
not have deserted her

  it seemed hopeless to reconcile the
talking talbot



two enterprises and he went to sleep
that night still racking his brains to
find a way out of his distressing
dilemma

chapter vii

  when morning came he saw his way
no clearer than before but at least it
was so far simplified that for the mo-
ment there was nothing else for him to
do but go to the prisoners camp

  he had tried the night before to ob-
tain a horse so that he might ride over
but all the good horses had been requi-
sitioned for the army and all the others
were in constant use on the farms

  however three miles made but a
short walk and he set out as soon as it
was advisable his thoughts were now
as they had been since last evening all
of the princess sonia

  he had tried to bring his mind to
bear on the case of donald but it
had not been a success t find him
or i dont find him at the camp he
said to himself i cant do a thing
about him till i know where he is but
that poor child they never would kill
her of course

  but he wasnt so sure of that as he
would have liked to be and so he for-
got donald for the thousandth time
and let his thoughts dwell on the perils
the misfortunes and the appealing
charm of sonia

  when he reached the camp he found
his affairs were already in an amaz-
ingly forward condition

  he was taken to the headquarters
outside the camp and there his creden-
tials were carefully examined by a
young officer

  you are the herr talbot described
here demand the lieutenant looking
up from the passport that lay in front
of him and smiling agreeablv

  yes

  and you seek a prisoner donald
brookfield according to this note from

his highness i suppose you know
him

  not very well it is seven or eight
years since i have seen him but i
think i would know him he might
know me better than  do him

  the lieutenant rang a bell bring
in here that convalescent prisoner who
is in the other room i hope we have
found your friend he added to talhot
as the soldier went out

  talbot sprang to his feet suprised
and delighted if only the affair were
moving correctly as well as smoothly
you dont mean he exclaimed that
you have taken the trouble to hunt him
out 

  when his highness was here yester-
day he gave orders to that effect you
have a good friend there sir

  his highness the governor of
budapest cried talbot he was
here yesterday

  yes he came down in his automo-
bile

  oh talbot was surprised though
grateful but why should his highness
take so much trouble for him he
might have asked some impertinent
questions in his amazement if at that
moment the door had not opened to
admit a gaunt shadow of a man lean-
ing on the soldiers arm

  talbot studied the sallow skeleton
trying to see in him the ruddy-faced
bright-eyed boy he had known the
convalescent stared at him for a few
moments then broke out almost sobbing
in his joy why you are ches tal-
bot 

  are you don brookfield cried
talbot in a shocked tone but leaping
to his feet and going to him

  whats left of me my god how
good it is to see you hows mother
crying her dear old eyes out

  he tried to be gay and casual but
he broke down and clung to talbot
tears running down his thin cheeks

  i come from your mother don


peoples

sit here talbot put him in his chair
been sick

  excuse these tears said don
smiling wanly but between joy and
weakness im about all in but what
does it mean he demanded am
i to be exchanged lie looked from
talbot to the officer

  the latter smiled pleasantly thats
it he said in good english there
has been an exchange of prisoners and
his highness has ordered that you are
to be included

  say murmured don faintly
thats good to hear

  how can i thank his highness
cried talbot warmly he is a very
noble gentleman he gave me no hint
of such generosity

  his highness loves americans the
officer said smiling now let me ex-
plain the prisoners will go under
escort to the swiss frontier where they
will be exchanged this young man
will be set free there if he will give
his promise not to bear arms against
the german allies during this war
with all my heart agreed don
a paper will be given you to sign
then

  when do they go demanded tal-
bot his thoughts on the princess once
more

  as early as possible this afternoon
  but my friend is too ill

  he will be conveyed to the train
in an automobile and on the train will
have a comfortable bed oh his high-
ness doesnt do things by halves your
friend will come to no harm on the
way

  but i must go back to the village
protested talbot all my clothes are
there

  you will have all the time you want
to overtake your friend the prisoners
wont be traveling on the de luxe ex-
press laughed the officer would
you like to help him get ready

  i may go into the camp then

  it will not be necessary your
friends effects-not very bulky i im-
agine-have been brought outside you
are both free to walk about or sit any-
where you please only he must be
ready by one oclock

  i shall be readysaid don with
a fervor that made the officer smile

 talbot was kept busy answering
dons eager questions and doing the
many little things that were possible
for his comfort on the journey to-
ward the last he sat down with don
in a sheltered spot

  do you think you can stand the
journey he asked

  itll do me good if you knew what
the camp is you wouldnt ask they
were fair and kind but a detention
camp is no place for a sick man why
im better already

  its evident i cant be with you on
the journey don

  of course not but dont worry
about me i dont need anybody to
look after me

  i expect to be at the swiss frontier
when you get there but if i shouldnt
be dont wait for me but go straight
on to paris

  yes yes

  youre sure you dont want more
money 

  you gave me twice as much as i
need

  talbot remained there and saw don-
ald start for the train comfortably en-
sconced in the back seat of an automo-
bile he had a half-shamed sense of
not completely fulfilling his mission in
not trying harder to go with don and
yet he knew that nothing could drag
him from the place until he had done
what he could to save the princess
sonia

  he waved his hat as don was car-
ried away and then after thanking
the young officer and sending through
him a message to the embassy in vi-
enna to be forwarded by wireless or
talking talbot



otherwise to mrs brookfield he turned
his face toward the little village again
his heart bounding with the thought
that now there was nothing to interfere
with his determination to rescue the
helpless girl at the castle

  the audacity of his purpose did not
occur to him he knew that i f he failed
he was quite likely to lose his life but
that he accepted as a mere incident he
had risked his life too many times for
what relatively were trifles to let that
weigh with him now

  it was impossible for him to make
any very definite plans beyond getting
the princess out of her prison since he
knew nothing of the country or the peo-
ple  but in a general way he meant to
compel the people of her own party to
help her escape that he considered
was the least they should do

  when he set out that afternoon he
had his belt of cartridges besides his
money belt on also he had found a
coil of strong pliable rope which he had
converted into a makeshift lasso with
the object of using it to obtain an en-
trance into the castle inclosure this
he concealed in one of the side pockets
of his outer coat

  when he reached the part of the wall
where the iron gate had been the day
before he found that it had been cov-
ered by a heavy iron-strapped oak door
similar to the other two he had noticed

  he was chagrined and alarmed did
it mean that his visit had been discov-
ered  or was it only done in the nat-
ural course of preventing any outlook
from the grounds

  he was afraid to call out or make
any noise to call sonias attention so
he went along the wall looking for a
place to throw the loop of his lasso
over he had noticed several project-
ing stones the previous day

  he found one a few rods farther 
and had  difficulty in tossing his loop
so that it fell over it he tightened it

and then went up the wall very easily
hand over hand

  when he was far enough up to en-
able him to peer over he did so with
the utmost caution no one was in
sight not even sonia his heart sank
at that but as he was beyond the limit
of the ruined garden he hoped it was
not significant of her absence

  he carefully climbed up and sat
astride the wall he detached the loop
from the stone doubled the rope caught
the doubled end over the stone and
slid down pulling the rope after him

  he had so far seen  one nor heard
any suspicious sound he hugged the
wall so that the shrubs growing at its
neglected base would hide him and so
concealed crept along to the garden

  a sort of fence that once had marked
the limits of the garden had been re-
placed by a natural hedge of currant
bushes and other wilder growths this
he pushed his way through

  the cottage stood about fifty feet
from him it gave no sign of life al-
though talbot watched it for several
minutes he crept toward the back of
it and then after listening again moved
cautiously along one side toward the
front

  peering around the corner he saw
the princess standing listlessly by one
of the pillars of the little porch she
looked unutterably lonely and hopeless
he wondered if it was because she be-
lieved that the new door had shut him
out from assisting her

  he stepped into view but she did not
see him until he spoke her name then
she turned with a start and a cry of
incredulity and joy

  you you came after all but
how 

  are you alone princess

  oh yes and i have been so un-
happy

  did you think the new door would
keep me from seeing you he asked
approaching her


peoples

   was so sure of it she looked
at him with her beautiful gray eyes
sweeping him from head to feet a flush
rising to her round cheek  had given
up hope

   will never desert you he said
you are very brave sir i dont
know what you can do but you surely
give me courage how did you get in
he told her she listened like a child
who is awed by a talc of great daring
you see he finished this is not a
difficult place to get into or out of

  she smiled rather pitifully not for
a strong brave man like you she said
but i am such a coward such a poor
little coward

  but you are going to trust me you
know princess and i am going to get
you out of here i came to tell you
about it are we quite safe here do
you think

  let us go over by those trees she
answered the shrubs will hide you if
any one should come but it is so early
that is not likely i thought of you all
night and all day to-day then when
the men came and put that door in
place i said to myself that i should
never see you again and now you
have come anyhow

  i told you i would be here i came
to tell you that to-night i am coming to
take you away to safety

  to-night oh she clasped her
hands together and looked into his face
i wonder if you can do it i believe
you can i never knew any one who
made me feel so sure he could do what
he said

  talbot felt himself grow hot and red
it is kind of you to feel that way he
said

  you make me feel so you say
things so quietly like a very very
strong person i dont know why you
should be so good to me do you know
your life will be in danger you
mustnt think it wont be have you
thought about that

 he smiled i suppose i have
thought about it but it makes no dif-
ference besides i think we shall get
away

  she put her hand confidingly on his
arm i told you you made me brave
do you know that you make me think
of one of the old knights they used
to go around the world seeking adven-
tures and helping distressed damsels
she laughed softly and looked up at
him in a way that made his blood
quicken you are my knight arent
you all the way from america ive
always heard that american men are so
splendid please tell me what im to
do

  his eyes were glowing softly a light
in them that no woman had ever seen
there before you have only to be
ready he said in a low tone i ex-
pect to be here about ten oclock that
will give us all night to travel in im
afraid you will have to walk at first
later we may get a horse

  oh i can walk im strong in that
way im much stronger than i look
and ill be brave with you  i know i
shall yesterday i felt braver after
you had gone and now im wonderfully
brave i think its having such a won-
derful man as you for a real friend
do you know she added with a half-
roguish smile that  am letting you
rescue me without knowing your
name 

  chester talbot

  you are noble

  there are no noblemen in america
he answered smiling

  ah yes i have heard that well
-she laughed softly-i am almost a
queen so i make you sir chester tal-
bot that is the way to do with ones
knight isnt it and you are my
knight

  vowed to your service most gra-
cious queen

  oh she cried turning pale and
holding by his arm it frightens me
talking talbot



to hear you say that that is what i
have been called lately she shud-
dered i wonder why i forgot oh
i hope you will be able to take me
away

  she was very appealing and very
charming in her clinging terror tal-
bot covered the little hands that lay
on his arm with his own

  i will surely take you away he
said if you could tell me the name
of any one we could go to to help us
out of the country is there no one at
all 

  not nearer than budapest she an-
swered dolefully and even there i
could not be sure you dont know
any one

  i might get help from the military
governor he has been very kind to
me

  what military governor she de-
manded quickly

  of budapest

  prince szchymsl

  i think thats his name hes the
military governor of budapest

  oh she gasped drawing away
from him and it was through him
that you came to me 

  no i havent seen him since i left
budapest

  hes your friend

  no but he has been very kind to
me he helped me get my friend free
from the prison camp what is the
matter why do you look at me like
that is he unfriendly to you

  you dont know oh you dont
know she wailed tell me you dont
know

  what dont know what i dont
understand

  she crept nearer again studying his
face anxiously if you are deceiving
me she said i shall never trust an-
other human being

  i am not deceiving you little sonia
tell me what you fear i dont under-
stand at all

  this castle belongs to prince
szchymsl she breathed

  she seemed to droop as she spoke as
if the mere statement of it made her
weak

  talbot put his arm about her to sup-
port her this place belongs to him
he said to the military governor of
budapest

  yes i was brought here by his
orders he is the countess elsas
cousin and main support

  talbot tightened his hold on the sup-
ple form of the frightened girl he felt
that he was again being tangled up in
the old silly plotting only now he real-
ized the danger that lurked in it

  it does not matter he said i
shall take you away from here to-night
and we shall manage somehow you
are sure there is no one to whom you
could go to be hidden

  you dont understand she said
simply nobody cares for me sonia
kotorska but only for the princess who
has certain royal blood in her veins
they thought the nobles of hungary
would gather about me because of that
blood it was a mistake then they
tried to marry me to the duke the
countess elsa who is very terrible they
say was before them and besides had
much money and many adherents then
i was a burden to them and yet i was
a menace to the other party that was
for the duke-the countess elsas
party so i was stolen away one night
and brought here the nobles who
dragged me away from my home in
bosnia have no longer any use for me
and yet i am dangerous to the other
party they say and i-i only ask to
go back to my little castle on the bosna
now do you understand

  yes i understand although it is
so incredible well little sonia-and
with his strong arm still about her waist
he looked down into her gray eyes-
i will have to save you alone at least


peoples

you can be no worse off than you are
you will trust me 

   do trust you she shyly disen-
gaged herself from his detaining arm
and smiled at him i will do what you
tell me to  will go where you say i
can be almost brave for you

  then somehow we shall leave to-
night some one sleeps at the cottage
to guard you

  two men soldiers

  no more that is good you know
how to ride

  better than i know how to do any-
thing else she answered smiling

  well i am afraid there are no
horses to be had but ill try to find two
if we could get to bosnia would you
be safe

  oh yes my own people love me
and although they could not protect
me they would hide me or smuggle me
into serbia

  ssh  he murmured i hear foot-
steps

  she listened and her face grew white
there are many men hear them
oh my sir chester she moaned i
am afraid

  she sprang close to him and nestled
against him when he put his arm
protectingly around her he peered
through the branches of the shrubs and
presently saw a small squad of uni-
formed men headed by a noncommis-
sioned officer marching down a broad
path toward the little garden they
were guided by a thickset man in civil-
ian garb

  talbots hand was on his revolver
but at sight of the rifles carried by the
men he dropped it back quick as he
was he couldnt hope to prevail over
all those armed men it was a time
for finesse not for force

  sonia he said quickly and with pas-
sionate earnestness now is the time
to show that you trust me and that you
can be brave

  i-i will try very hard she panted

studying his fiercely determined
tell me

  i think those men have come to
you to the castle i could die here
you but i could not save you
must go with them i will follow
and rescue you will you still 
me 

  yes she breathed her face v
and her whole body trembling 
-you shall see what-what a little 
aid can-can do

  go out then dear let them
you but remember i shall ab
be watching over you go  he lo
her took her small hand and carri
to his lips

       chapter viii

  the princess sonia tottered foi
first steps away from talbot and
a piteous despairing glance bac
him then as if summoning the c
age she had promised to display
walked more steadily into the open
waited for the coming of the men

  the squad of soldiers remained
side of the garden leaving the ol
and the other man to approach
princess and then talbot tha
heaven for the inspiration not to r
a struggle for with the men ren
ing at a distance he would have
without a chance

  he crouched so as to be the b
concealed the men approachec
within a couple of paces of the 
cess the officer saluted the 
man bowed with scant courtesy

  you are to go to the castle i
ness the latter said

  why must i go there she ac
a terrible fear taking possession of
why have these soldiers come v
does it mean

  i am only obeying orders highn
the officer said saluting again
it please your highness to lead
way
talking talbot



  talbot saw her droop for a second
then half turn her face toward him and
draw herself up me was sure she was
trying to show him that she could be
brave when he was near

  he had already been struck by the
formality of the escort it was plainly
an attempt to give an air of legality
to what was in contemplation and it
made him realize that the power and
the machinery of a state were controlled
by the enemies of the princess

  he knew he was enlisted in a des-
perate cause and he could see no way
to success but at least he could keep on
trying

  he let the party get some distance
away before he moved he could see
the princess leading the way up the
path making a picture of dignity and
pathos she looked so helpless so
small so alone

  for a long distance he kept between
the wall and the shrubbery then as the
castle came nearer he was able to steal
out and use trees and clumps of shrub-
bery for concealment

  the castle was a huge building or
set of buildings for although con-
nected by covered passages it really
consisted of the castle proper and a
whole village of subordinate buildings

  smoke issued from the chimneys of
the main building and from what tal-
bot judged to be the chimneys of the
servants quarters

  although still fairly light out of
doors it was evidently dark enough in-
doors to require lights for from open-
ings in the curtains of the great win-
dows of the second floor streaks of light
came

  a deep and wide moat surrounded
the castle but there was no water in it
and the drawbridge was permanently
down

  over this bridge the men marched
led by the slightly swaying figure of the
princess it seemed to talbot that half-
way across she stopped and cast a for-

lorn look back he wondered if she
had begun yet to question if he would
ever be able to find her

  it was not in his heart to blame the
poor child if she doubted him for he
could see no way yet of doing anything

  he crept warily near to the castle and
waited hoping something would occur
to suggest a plan to him in a few min-
utes the squad of soldiers with the of-
ficer marched out again broke ranks on
the turf and went in disorder to the
servants quarters laughing and talk-
ing

  while they were filing out of the
house a light broke out in one of the
windows on the lower floor to the right
of the drawbridge that window was
grated as was plainly evident and tal-
bot knew that it was where sonia had
been placed

  there was something too sinister
in this disposition of the girl to be
doubted and talbot could see her
drooping and losing all hope if he
could only get a word to her to revive
her spirits

  he studied the place as well as he
could at the distance and it seemed to
him that where the wall of the castle
had once presented a smooth surface
all the way down it had in the course of
time been worn away at the level of the
water in the moat so that perhaps there
might be foothold there now

  it was growing darker rapidly so
that he felt safe in approaching nearer
to the castle finally he found a place
that gave him a view into the lighted
chamber

  he drew in his breath as he looked
it was plainly a cell but it had been
made fairly comfortable with furniture
though that fact did not seem to have
much weight with the princess who sat
on the side of the little bed a listless
pathetic picture of utter loneliness

  a fury of rage shook talbot as he
looked why should that sweet inno-
cent creature be made a victim of the


peoples

lust for power he vowed that some
one should pay for what she was being
made to suffer and lie dared not think
of what he would do if they had the
hellish wickedness to take that sweet
life

  while waiting for a deeper darkness
to come he made a hasty and cautious
survey of the buildings locating the
servants quarters the stables and other
parts of the massive pile

  by the time he had done this it was
dark enough to justify him in trying to
reach the window of the princess cell

  lie crossed the drawbridge lightly
and examined the wall carefully lie
found that he could make his way along
the face of the castle with some risk
of a fall into the deep moat he trusted
to his skill as an athlete to help him
there however and presently was near-
ing the window from which the light
shone

  looking in first to be sure she was
alone he tapped  the glass the
princess started half in alarm half it
seemed in hope and looked at the win-
dow

  he tapped again louder she started
up and ran to the window and shaded
her eyes so that she might see outside

  sonia he called gently

  she must have heard his voice for
she made a gesture of joy and nodded
her head then she unfastened the win-
dow and opened it as far as it would
go

  you are thefe sir chester she
cried in a tone of passionate joy

  put your light very low he whis-
pered

  she ran over to it and turned it
down it was an old-fashioned oil
lamp then she returned to the win-
dow

  i was thinking you never never
could see me or speak to me again she
said ill never doubt again oh how
brave and good you are

  fie readied in and took her hand and

put it to his lips while i live you
can count  me sonia have you
found out why they have brought you
here

  no but i am afraid oh i am not
afraid as i was before-before i knew
you but i know they have brought
me here for some evil purpose

  dont lose hope dear  matter
what happens i must not stay here
or  shall be seen good-by for a little
while

  he had held her hand all the while
he kissed it now twice and then again
she drew her hand back and in the dim
light he was sure he saw her press the
back of her hand to her own sweet lips

  my brave true knight she mur-
mured

  sonia dearest he said softly

  he crept back and was almost on the
bridge again when the door opened
he shrank back and stooped so that he
was in the shadow of one of the old
supports of the ancient- portcullis

  i must have a word with you alone
prince said a voice talbot recognized
at once as that of the countess elsas
brother

  yes yes maurus was the impa-
tient response talbot was sure it was
the military governor who was speak-
ing

  i dont like this plan of a summary
court-martial elsa is too drastic in her
methods

   tell you it is the one wise thing
to do

  it is the one wicked and cruel thing
to do why should we stain our hands
with innocent blood our cause is just
the people are with us the whole game
is in our hands

  it will be in our hands when-

  maurus is still arguing broke in
the rich voice of the countess elsa
nonsense you are military gover-
nor endowed with absolute power to act
in the interests of the government do
your duty highness the mocking note
talking talbot



was in her voice even while she urged
what talbot knew in his heart was the
one most awful deed

  but elsa  pleaded the young count

  come prince  she said curtly the
longer you put it off the longer will
maurus waste our time it is the only
thing to do what is one life to the
security of a kingdom

  the door was closed and talbot
heard no more it was what he had
believed was contemplated but to have
heard it discussed in such a way left
him quivering with horror

  he rose up and stood staring out
into the darkness what could he do
alone against these cold-blooded plot-
ters he saw no way but to act blindly
to be reckless under such conditions
was to be wise

  acting on this conclusion he listened
for a moment at the door that had just
been closed and then opened it his
revolver was in his hand every sense
alert

  the door as it turned out was an
ordinary one made in the great arch
that had once opened from the draw-
bridge into a semicircular courtyard
the massive grating that had once
guarded the entrance bad been replaced
by masonry excepting for the space
occupied by the door the courtyard
remained as it had been

  in front of him at the top of a flight
of broad stone steps was a great wide
door which manifestly opened into the
part of the castle-occupied by the noble
owner at bis left on the level of the
stone flagging was a small plain door
a similar door opened at his right this
much was plainly visible even in the
growing darkness

  he took it for granted that the count-
ess elsa and her companions had gone
in by the great door at the center also
that the door at the right led to the part
where the princess was imprisoned

  his heart gave a bound why not
take this opportunity to free her and

escape it was a thing so little ex-
pected by her captors that they had
taken no pains to guard her

  it was no sooner in his brain than
he was executing it lie ran to the
door and pulled it open once inside
he was in total darkness but after a
moment or two of hesitation he was
able to see where a streak of light
touched the blackness of the floor

  feeling his way along the wall until
he came to the light he then tried to
find some way of looking into the room
to assure himself that it was the one he
sought the door was tight however

  he might have spoken to her but if
it really were she who was there it
woidd serve no good purpose and if
it were not the sound might serve to
notify some unfriendly person that a
stranger was there

   he felt about for the lock and found
that the door was secured by a padlock
the strap and staples of which were of
-heavy wrought iron although the lock
itself was ordinary it would have
withstood almost any pressure from
within but was easily breakable from
outside

  with any ordinary tool or even with
a stout stick of wood it would have
been a matter of only a minute to burst
the padlock as it was he took the thing
in both hands and exerting his great
strength began twisting it

   it was not easy to do and it was sev-
eral minutes before the loop of the lock
began to give way but once it did be-
gin progress was swift when the lock
came apart perspiration was rolling
down talbots face fie wiped it has-
tily away and pulled the door open

  the princess had heard him working
at her door and not suspecting that it
could be he had been alarmed and
when he saw her she was at the far
end of the little cell her back to the
wall her great gray eyes staring in
terror

   sonia he cried softly


peoples

  sir chester oh sir chester she
murmured and ran to him in a passion
of joy

  he took her two hands in his he
wanted to take her in his arms put
your hat and coat on quickly he said
we must escape at once

  she flashed a look of admiration at
him you are afraid of nothing she
said

  praise had never greatly mattered to
him he was a masterful man who
knew himself capable and had been in
the main indifferent to the admiration
his strength and courage had elicited
it seemed however that the opinion of
the princess was of the utmost conse-
quence for the expression of it set his
heart beating quicker

  he helped her on with her coat her
hat was a readily adjusted felt affair
that she merely pulled down over her
brown curls it was no time to speak
of such a thing but talbot could not
help thinking that the effect was rav-
ishing

  he took her by the hand whispering
there is danger but you must trust
me

  she pressed his hand im learning
not to be such a coward- she said in
her soft tones

  he led her out into the courtyard
and had reached the exit door when
there came the sound of voices from
outside

  talbot could not understand what was
said because hungarian was used but
the princess gasped and pulled back in
terror

  the soldiers she whispered
they are coming in we are caught

  there was the impulse to dash out
and try to take them by surprise but
it was dismissed at once he might
overcome them but the chances were
terribly against it

  he turned and dragged her to the
flight of steps and up them she fol-
lowed him docilely he pushed open

the door and went in closing the door
after him then he stood there ready
to defend her against her enemies on
the inside in case they should be at-
tracted by any noise they had made in
entering

  a murmur of voices came from some-
where but no sound to indicate that any
alarm had been raised

  he listened to the sounds outside
he could hear the heavy-footed soldiers
enter and draw up together then some
loudly spoken words

  what was said he demanded feel-
ing her two hands catch and cling to his
arm

  the man is going after me and the
soldiers are to wait there for him oh
sir chester

  it was a desperate situation instinc-
tively the princess got as close to him
as possible and he put his arm about
her

  come he said with sudden deci-
sion and led her into the castle make
no noise do you know where we are
have you ever been in here before

  this is a big hall she answered
in a whisper there are big rooms-on
both sides of it there is a great stair-
way in the middle- oh

  a door had been thrown open from
a brightly lighted room the princess
trembled so violently that she would
surely have sunk to the floor if talbot
had not sustained her he held himself
tense his revolver ready

  a man looked into the hall they
are not here yet he said and went
back leaving the door open he had
spoken in german so that talbot un-
derstood

  he knew what the words meant too
the summary court-martial that hor-
rible mockery of the forms of justice
was to be held in that room

  come dear he said and led her
toward the great stairway which was
now visible

  for a few steps she managed to go
talking talbot



with him but the thought of passing
that open door robbed her of strength
and she drooped without a moment
of hesitation he picked her up in his
arms and carried her across the broad
band of light to the stairway

  his intention was to make the upper
floor if possible and since it could be
done only by taking the risk of cross-
ing the band of light he meant to do
it even if they were discovered what
he hoped and what happened was that
the persons in the room were not look-
ing out

  he won to the stairs and up them
before the outer door was flung open
by the jailer of the princess crying fran-
tically  she has escaped she is
gone he spoke in hungarian but
his meaning was clear

  it was very dark where they were
but talbot followed the baluster rail
and found it ran around a sort of bal-
conv that looked down into the great
half

  from inside the lighted room rose a
hubbub of voices followed by an erup-
tion into the hall of the persons there
a swift questioning of the man took
place on the part of prince szchymsl
whose rage grew as he learned what
had happened

  suddenly a voice rose clear and dis-
tinct above the others it came from
the opposite side of the hall if the
cell was broken open from the outside
it said in german it means we have
a traitor among us where is mau-
rus

  it was the countess elsa who spoke
her brother who answered from an-
other part of the hall i am here
elsa are you calling me a traitor
is that what your words mean 

  you were opposed to us did you
help her escape

  if a man asked me that question he
woidd not live to hear the answer

  i suppose we must take that for a
denial she cried sharply come

prince let us go to the cell set
everybody searching for her she cant
have gone far she changed to hun-
garian and gave the frightened jailer
a number of stern orders

  this is a frightful misfortune said
prince szchymsl if the princess es-
capes we are all in danger

  then lose no time cried the count-
ess furiously stamping her foot
come the rest of you wait here till
we come back maurus the least you
can do is to join the hunt

  he turned and left the hall followed
by his sister and the prince the others
remained where they were talking in
low frightened tones

chapter ix

  talbot dared not move from where
he stood as long as the men remained in
the hall below he stood with his arm
about the frightened girl supporting
her

  it seemed a long time that they
waited the men below were too much
perturbed to return to the room they
had come from and kept close together
talking in low tones

  after what seemed a long time the
countess and prince szchymsl returned
in gloomy silence

  did you discover anything asked
one of the conspirators

  nothing new snapped the countess
elsa the lock was broken on the
outside which can mean nothing but
that we have a traitor among us i
thought it might be count maurus but
i know him so well that his answer sat-
isfies me it can be none of us it
must be one of prince szchymsls men
but which one anyhow she is gone
and we must decide what to do in the
circumstances

 my men and count maurus are
searching for her said the prince

  if she gets back to budapest-

began one of the conspirators


peoples

  countess elsa interrupted him  she
mustnt prince your car is ready is
it not

  it waits in front of the castle ready
to go

  we must get to budapest at once
you can get your whole secret service
out to intercept the princess it is her
life or ours are you ready

  only to put my hat and coat on

  you gentlemen remain here till
morning she commanded if the
princess is not found come at once to
the city and report to the prince if
she is found and brought back-she
hesitated a moment-well dont take
any more risks do you understand

  yes one of them responded in a
low tone

  ill not be two minutes prince she
said and turned and ran up the stairs

  the princess stifled a cry of fear and
crowded close to talbot he stood still
hoping the countess would turn away
from them but fortune was against
them the countess turned and ap-
proached them guiding herself in the
darkness by the baluster rail

  you ought to modernize this old
place prince she called out as she
went along then stopped suddenly and
peered toward talbot and the princess
trying to make out what it was she saw

  talbot acted promptly taking the
boldest course he pushed the princess
to one side and sprang at the countess
the latter screamed and darted back

  she was not quick enough however
and talbot had her securely around the
waist she screamed for help and the
men below started to her assistance
she fought like a tigress outraged by
the insult she thought had been done
her

  ill kill the first man that mounts
those stairs talbot cried in a tone
that rang high above every sound

  the men all stopped they were
brave enough but there was something

compelling in the cold tones of that
voice

  talking talbot the countess ex-
claimed in a tone of wonder and in-
stantly ceased to struggle

  the prince ashamed of the hesita-
tion of himself and friends once more
moved as if to rush to her assistance

 you are a dead man prince
szchymsl if you try it snapped tal-
bot

  stay where you are prince said
the countess quietly he could kill you
all before you could reach me it is
my american friend this time she
laughed softly and turned her head and
spoke to talbot so you insist on
meddling

  if you hadnt begun the meddling
i never would have crossed your path
he answered as it is here i am dis-
tressed to incommode you but com-
pelled to do so

  so you released the princess with
what object please

  to save her from assassination
nonsense she was in no danger
and now what are you going to do if
you dont mind telling me

  not in the least he answered his
coolness equaling her own i am going
to hold you as a hostage for the good
behavior of your friends below there
and do you find this way of holding
me absolutely necessary she referred
to the fact that his arms were about
her

  neither necessary nor agreeable
he answered which reminds me that
there is a much better way

  with this he held her firmly with one
arm while he took from his pocket the
rope he had used to climb the wall with
finding the noose he suddenly caught
her two hands and brought them be-
hind her where he secured them by
drawing the noose tight this done he
proceeded to fasten her ankles together

  the countess bit her lip to keep back
the flood of angry words that struggled
talking talbot



for utterance the men below stood at
the foot of the stairs in indecision
straining their eyes to see what was
going on above

  i should think you would know this
wont help you she said when she had
controlled her anger you cant carry
me about the country and sooner or
later you will be trapped

  im taking long chances countess
gentlemen he said raising his voice
and addressing them a little conversa-
tion is necessary

  you shall suffer for this sir said
the prince i did everything for you
and you repay me in this way

  on the surface responded talbot
feeling with one hand for the princess
and drawing her to his side my con-
duct doesnt seem like a nice return
but there is so much that is not on the
surface however i have a proposal
to make i am grateful to you for your
help to me no matter what your object
was and to prove it i will give my
word of honor to rid you finally and
completely of the princess sonia
what do you mean  was the quick
demand

  i mean i will promise for her that
she will leave this country and never
lend herself to any attempt on the
throne

  how can you promise that

  let the princess promise for her-
self then princess will you tell these
men that you will do as i have said
clinging to him the trembling girl
raised her sweet voice with an effort
and said i do not want the throne
i do not want to have anything to do
with it i will never set foot in hun-
gary again if you will let me leave it in
safety

one moment before you answer
cried talbot i have the countess
elsa in my power and i shall not let
her go until the princess is in safety
what pledge will the princess give

to fulfill her engagement the prince
asked

  that is a foolish question prince
the princess loathes the whole affair
and asks nothing better than to put it
all away from her how can she give
any pledges 

  you seem to know her thoughts very
well said the countess

  she has expressed them freely to
me

  all the time that he had been talking
talbot had been trying to find a solu-
tion of the situation he knew very
well that determined as the countess
was to eliminate the princess from the
contest nothing he had to offer would
be of the least value he knew too
that although the countess served very
well for the time being to protect them
it was impossible for him to hold her
permanently

  there is one way by which she can
give a pledge the countess said

  what is that

  become your wife was the mock-
ing reply i am sure she must be grate-
ful to you for what you have done for
her what do you say princess sonia

  the princess sonia doesnt need to
make any response to such a question
talbot said quickly then raised his
voice and cried sharply to the men be-
low all of you retire to the back end
of the hall i am going down

  the men resented the tone and hesi-
tated the prince voiced their feeling
we do not obey commands from such
as you

  youll obey this talbot said icily
countess tell them that i can kill every
one of them i tell them that i not
only can but will if they oppose me
my position is not one that leaves me
any choice tell them countess

  this man said the countess ad-
dressing the men below has the repu-
tation of being the quickest man in
america with a revolver i would ad-
vise that you do as he wishes


peoples

  her tone was mocking and sinister
leaving talbot with the feeling that she
wished her friends to understand that
she had something in reserve it only
made talbot more cautious

  follow me closely princess he said
to her then lifted the helpless countess
and put her rather ignominiously over
his left shoulder thus leaving his right
hand free to manipulate the revolver

  oh sir chester the princess mur-
mured i am afraid

  he put his arm about her and held
her a moment while he whispered en-
couragingly you are not afraid you
are nervous be my brave little sonia
and we shall -win to safety

  he could feel her bosom rise and fall
quickly then was sure she pressed
closer to him i will be brave she
said

  the countess elsa laughed scorn-
fully whether she had heard or not
talbot was stung by the laugh for he
had yielded to the ineffable sweetness
of the interchange with sonia and he
felt as if he had betrayed a weakness
to this woman who was so cold and
calculating herself

  he gave sonias little hand a squeeze
to show that he appreciated what she
was doing and then started for the
stairway as the men below retired to
the back end of the hall

  he carried the countess easily and
when the hall was reached looked
keenly about he had little fear of the
men as long as he had the countess for
a shield knowing that if they carried
weapons none of them was sure enough
of his marksmanship to venture a shot
at him

  there was a big chair at one side of
the hall and in this he deposited the
countess taking his position at the other
side of her sonia had followed close
behind him holding to his coat like a
little child

  is there a door at the front end
princess he asked in a low tone

  yes

  would you be brave enough to go
and open it while i remain here to keep
an eye on these men and the countess
she put her hand on his arm as if
to plead her cowardice then took it off
and breathed  i-i will-will try
he patted her arm in tender encour-
agement he heard her sigh and saw
her straighten up as she started off

  what is your plan sir chester
demanded the countess sarcastically

  he found an amazing difference be-
tween her way of saying sir chester
and sonias indeed he winced under
the ridicule though he gave no sign of
disturbance

  my plan is to escape he said
and you are infatuated enough to
think you can do it do you think you
are in your own wild west better
make terms sir chester

  what terms

  give up the girl and leave hungary
i know you are thinking it would be un-
chivalrous but after all sir chester
you will have to give her up and lose
yourself in the bargain where can
you go

  i might find my way into budapest
you will be overtaken before you
have gone a mile

  at least you will be there loo
countess i would not think of going
without you

  he had been watching for the open-
ing of the door which would follow the
fumbling of sonia with the bolts also
he had kept a wary eye on the group
of whispering men at the other end of
the hall sonia came running to him
with the speed of fear

  it is open she whispered

  he raised his voice let no man
move on peril of death he said he
took up the countess again and backed
his way to the door guided by sonia
as soon as she realized what he was
trying to do

  he darted through the door and
talking talbot



closed it behind him there was no
way of fastening it on the outside but
lie had anticipated that and lost  time
trying it

  the princes automobile stood  the
driveway outside the driver in it ready
to start at an instants notice a glance
told talbot it was a car he was familiar
with and that it was a high-powered
machine

  paying  attention to the chauffeurs
look of astonishment he placed the
countess on the vacant front seat sud-
denly took hold of the chauffeur and
lifted him out of his seat as if he had
been an infant and tossed him uncere-
moniously aside

  get in princess he said at the
same time assisting her all the while
he was watching for a sudden attack

  a swift examination showed him that
the car was equipped with a self-starter
and that it was in working order he
leaped into the seat beside the countess
pressed the self-starter and the car was
off

  the countess had watched him as he
had done all these things in the confi-
dent precise way of one master of the
situation and for the first time real
alarm took possession of her if tal-
bot knew what to do he had it in his
power now to thwart all her plans and
even to make an end of her but did
he know

  in fact talbot did not know the ex-
tent of his power but he guessed from
a few of the things he had overheard
that it would not be well for the con-
spirators to have the princess reach
budapest on the other hand he was
afraid the risk for the princess might
also be great

  he said nothing however but guided
the car along the drive and into the for-
est road setting up high speed as soon
as the straight road was reached

  a backward glance had shown him
the prince and his companions standing
together in front of the castle but he

    

gave himself no concern over them
though he wound an end of the rope
that bound the countess around his arm

  permit me she said composedly
to express my sincere admiration of
you sir chester i am sure there would
lie a kingdom of hungary to-morrow
if you led the revolution

  praise from you is sweet he said
dryly then turned smilingly to the prin-
cess are you comfortable

  she smiled faintly she really was
wishing she sat in front with him she
always had more courage when near
him

  are you making for budapest the
countess asked

  is there any other place youd rather
not go to he demanded

  it holds as much disaster for her as
for me she answered

  i had thought of going to vienna
he said

  it is open to the same objections
she answered

  he could see that she was alarmed
and wished to keep him from taking her
to either of the two capital cities but
what he had better do he could not de-
cide he hoped she would give him a
clew

  not quite the same he said medi-
tatively in vienna your capture is
worth far more than hers believe me
your worth is fully appreciated in vi-
enna and i could make it by mid-
night or sooner with this car yes
you have decided me i will go to vi-
enna

  princess sonia cried the countess
with a sudden vehemence that betrayed
her disturbance of mind is it true
that you wish to withdraw from your

party

  i never have been in it willingly
the princess answered

  it is hard for a woman like you to
understand countess interposed tal-
bot but the princess loathes the whole
business


peoples

 stop the car commanded the
countess let us make terms and
put something about me im freezing
i beg your pardon he stopped the
car and wrapped a rug about the shiver-
ing woman what terms countess
we have no time to waste

  free me and put me down here i
promise to refrain from any unfriendly
act toward the princess on her agree-
ment to leave the country and take no
further part in any revolution in this
country

  what security have we that you will
keep your promise

  my word she answered proudly

  it was not quite the sort of security
he would have wished but he knew it
was the best possible under the circum-
stances so he pretended a greater con-
fidence than he felt in accepting it

  very well countess i am sparing
your life and making your ambition pos-
sible so i hope you will be as good as
your word

  he unloosed her and helped her into
the road she gave utterance to a sigh
of profound relief

  you are a strong antagonist mr
talbot maurus knew you better than i
did which way now

  which way do you suggest he
demanded

  theres a fine road running south
to the princess home in bosnia not
more than two hundred miles away
you could make it by morning

  and where do i come to that road
it is the first important road you
come to turn to the left you will
have no difficulty in finding it

  any large towns on the way

  let me see theres kecskemet

felegyhaza- oh three or four

but you should have  trouble with
them you can go around them
thank you countess will you sit
in front with me princess

  he helped her into the front seat got
into the car himself and started the

countess stood in the darkness listen-
ing a wicked smile on her red lips

chapter x

  for ten minutes perhaps the car
sped swiftly on without a word being
exchanged between the fugitives fin-
nally talbot spoke what do you
think of the countess advice princess
im afraid of her she answered
timidly

  what do you think will happen if
we take that road

  we shall encounter many soldiers 
am sure

  and most likely friends of prince
szchymsls that was my notion i
know nothing of this country how-
ever can you suggest anything what
about going to budapest

  please no she answered in terror
they will get me again and go on with
the revolution worse than ever or
they will make me marry the duke
oh sir chester dont take me back
ill do nothing you dont wish me
to he answered but indeed little
sonia i dont know what to do

  you are sure to know she said con-
fidently perhaps you could get to
serbia or bosnia you are so wonder-
ful

  he knew she wasnt trying to flatter
him but was speaking her real thought
he was deliciously thrilled by it and
was ready to give his life to bring her
to safety nevertheless he was at a
loss

  at the great road the countess had
spoken of he turned as she had di-
rected there was almost no traffic on
it and he went ahead at full speed his
glaring lights showing him that it was
safe ahead

  he was absolutely adrift as to a plan
of action whichever way he turned
seemed to be charged with danger he
knew the country toward serbia was
full of soldiers and the chances were
talking talbot



that the countess fully expected him
and the princess to be stopped and held
for the countess orders

  he was cudgeling his brains in si-
lence when something happened that
took the matter out of his hands the
fuel gave out and with a few ineffective
coughs the car stopped

  he jumped out and looked at the gas
tanks both were empty and as gas
was one of the scarce things now he
knew he must abandon the car

  come princess he said we
must walk now

  where shall we go she asked
springing out of the car with the utmost
blitheness as if the breakdown was a
matter of little consequence it was
only of human beings that she seemed
to be afraid ordinary troubles she met
cheerfully

  i dont know he answered this
looks like a forest here wait till i
push the car to the side of the road
he not only pushed it to the side of
the road but ditched it he removed
one of the headlights and put the other
one out he was not expecting pursuit
at once if at all though he did not fail
to consider that the chauffeur would
know how little gas there was in the
tanks in any case it was prudent to
get as far as possible from that spot
where the car stood as evidence against
them

  have you any idea where we are
princess he asked when he rejoined
her

  none at all all i know is that the
danube must be a short distance to the
west of here

  the danube perhaps we carr reach
it anti find a boat in which to go down
it i forget my geography but i think
the danube runs through bosnia
doesnt it

  oh sir chester she laughed is
there something you dont know the
danube goes near bosnia but doesnt
touch it it does run along the edge of

serbia though and in serbia we shall
be safe safer than in bosnia but
everywhere there are troops these

days

  if we can find a boat we can travel
only by night and hide in the daytime
would you be afraid

  i think i am afraid of nothing when
you are by my side sir chester i m
sure i would learn to be brave in time

  you are brave now little sonia
come then take my arm and hold
tightly we will try to find the river

  the ditch by the roadside was a deep
one but easily crossed and in a few
minutes they were making their way
through a noble forest almost free of
undergrowth

  the walking was good the powerful
light of the automobile lamp made the
way clear and to crown all the princess
was happier than talbot had yet seen
her like the child she was she had
thrown her cares away confident in the
prowess and wisdom of her knight

  he felt anything but confident him-
self but it rejoiced him to see how com-
pletely she trusted him and he listened
to her as he had never listened to music
in his life

  he wished his light had been a smaller
one he wished they would soon come
to the river and he prayed that he
could justify the confidence of the prin-
cess by taking her to safety

  in the meantime there was a strange
delight in walking in the lonely woods
with that beautiful creature hanging on
his arm pressing close to his side and
talking to him as if they had known
each other for years instead of mere
hours

  she was full of admiration for his
strength courage and resourcefulness
and wondered how he had dared to do
the things he had and why had he
that seemed to puzzle her

  i dont understand why you should
take so much trouble for me she said
it isnt as if you had known me you


peoples

just came on me all frightened to death
and started in to rescue me why did
you do it sir chester  did you have a
reason 

  you were reason enough he an-
swered troubled to know what to say
how could any man have left you in
such a plight

  would any american have done it
just as you did she asked

  some might have done it better i
dont feel very proud of making you
take a walk like this at such an hour
are you tired

  oh no im not like a storybook
princess i have been a poor girl all
my life and if it had not been that i
had some of that wretched blood royal
in my veins nobody would ever have
given me a second thought why i
am used to climbing the mountains  im
strong even if i am such a coward
are you very much ashamed of me
im proud of you princess

  i like it best when you call me
sonia

  i like sonia too but i thought may-
be-

  maybe what

  that you might not like me to be so
familiar in moments of excitement or
danger it seemed natural to call you
sonia but i wouldnt have you think i
lacked respect lor you

  you lack respect and she laughed
merrily laying her head against his
shoulder as she did so isnt that
funny why you are the most splen-
did and wonderful man i ever heard
of you are like a storybook knight
i couldnt imagine you doing anything
that wasnt exactly right and proper
i would never mean to he said
gravely

  of course you wouldnt ah if you

had been the duke- she stopped

embarrassed

  who is this duke he asked hastily
  the duke of jankovacz

  that meant nothing to talbot but lie

said oh  and then asked why do
you dislike him so much you said you
disliked him

  i hate him hes big and stupid and
-and horrid i met him twice in
budapest the nobles who were try-
ing to make me queen found they were
not strong enough so they thought it
would be a good idea to marry me to
the duke you see they wanted to get
the power out of the hands of prince
szchmysl and the countess elsa

  yes i see and so they contrived
the interview

  yes the duke was secretly brought
to my hiding place i think he had seen
me once before when i didnt know it
the first time we met he did nothing
but stare at me i was frightened and
was as still as he was

  then he saw you again talbot
suggested he was deeply interested
in the matter

  yes after he had gone the first
time my nobles told me he was very
much taken with me and was ready to
enter into an alliance i let them know
that i didnt like him but they only
laughed at me you see i was power-
less in their hands

  no i dont see why were you
well my uncle was on their side
he had brought me up and i was
afraid of him i always had done what
he wanted me to though he had never
troubled me much till this revolution
was thought of after this awful war
was started he said i must be queen
and then he said i must marry the
duke what could i do

  poor little sonia and the duke
saw you a second time

  yes he came again i think he had
been drinking a great deal that time for
he had plenty to say he told me he
adored me and that hungary would be
fortunate to have such a queen and
once he tried to kiss me i-i was
afraid but i struck him

  my brave little sonia 
talking talbot



  do you think it was brave i was
afraid you would think it horrid of me
my uncle said it was unwomanly the
duke only laughed and said he was glad
i wasnt such a mouse as i seemed
how i hated him  had never wanted
to be a queen after that it seemed hor-
rible to me the countess elsa would
make a much better queen she is very
beautiful isnt she

  very but not pleasing why didnt
your nobles try to rescue you when you
were stolen from them

  they knew that with me gone
prince szchymsl would arrest them and
try them by court-martial the minute
they tried to do anything you see
with me they could start a revolution
any time i dont know why for i
never could understand but that is
what they said

  would you have let them marry you
to the duke talbot asked

  t suppose so she answered cling-
ing closer to him i hated him but i
didnt know what to do was it very
very cowardly of me

  perhaps he answered hesitatingly
it is hard for me to understand of
course you were in their hands

  sir chester she said softly

  yes 

  i wouldnt marry him now i am
braver than i was im sure they
couldnt make me do it now

  i like to hear you say that i am
sure you would be very unhappy to
marry a man like that

  do you think i would be brave
enough now sir chester

  i hope so

  i know i would if i was sure you
were ready to help me you wont

leave me until- she stopped at the

thought of a time when this wonderful
man would leave her

  i will not leave you until you wish
it he said

  they both fell silent after that and
were walking along quietly preceded by

the cone-shaped flood of light when
they were suddenly halted by a voice
behind them the speech was hun-
garian and the princess with a cry
stopped short

  talbot stopped too understanding by
the tone that it was a command to halt
he swung about putting the princess
behind him bringing the light to bear-
on the speaker and drawing his re-
volver

  who are you  he demanded in
german

  who are you who walks in these
forests with an automobile lamp

  by what right do you ask de-
manded talbot fiercely

  the right of might was the curt
response behind you and all about
you are my men now tell me what
you are doing here and lower that
light so that it wont be in my eyes

  talbot lowered the light so that it
fell on the earth only he had seen that
his interlocutor was in the uniform
of an officer and that several soldiers
were back of him

  we were automobiling he said
and our machine ran out of gas we
left it by the roadside and came hunting
for a house hoping we might get gaso-
line

  who are you put your weapon
away

  still affecting a docility he was far
from feeling talbot put his revolver
back and answered i am an ameri-
can and have heen visiting the prison-
ers camp to find a friend my passport
is in order and i have papers to show
that i went by permission of the mili-
tary governor of budapest

  who is the lady

  a friend of mine

  the officer laughed likely enough
let me look at her

  will you be so ungentlemanly  de-
manded talbot

  if you will kindly let me have your
lamp you shall see was the response


peoples

with a good-natured laugh come sir

i	must do my duty im sure she cant
be so ugly that she will object to being
seen

  talbot saw himself trapped and help-
less it was a time for wit not muscle
he handed the lamp to the officer who
immediately turned it full on them

  i beg you let me see your face fair
lady he laughed

  it is better talbot said in a low
tone to the princess who was obsti-
nately sheltering herself behind him at
his word she came into view

  the officer was now in the shadow
and they could not see his face lie
was silent for a moment before crying
out in a tone of wonder and delight
it is the princess sonia kotorska

  the princess with a cry of terror
drew close to talbot whose revolver
was out in an instant though he knew
very well that all the odds were now
against him

  in fact his weapon had hardly been
drawn when he regretted it and it only
needed the words of the officer to cause
him to put it away again

  put it back sir you are with
friends come with me and you will
be well taken care of and joyfully re-
ceived your luck is surely with you
highness how did you escape

  he gave the lamp to one of the sol-
diers issued a few orders in hungarian
and stood at respectful attention
though talbot noted that the soldiers
formed about them a guard of honor
perhaps but none the less a security
against their escape

  may i ask who are the friends you
speak of talbot inquired

  let it remain a pleasant surprise
was the cautious response i pledge
you my word that the princess will re-
ceive a royal welcome as befits her dig-
nity and he made a low respectful
bow

  what do you wish to do princess
he asked her

  you must decide she answered
tremulously

  pardon me interposed the officer
respectfully but  have no choice but
to escort you to the castle

  whose castle the princess de-
manded quickly

  forgive me if in prudence i leave
that question unanswered may i hope
you will follow me highness

  she looked up at talbot pressing his
arm as if to let him know that she
would follow his command

  i think we must go princess he
said aloud adding in a whisper  see
no other way i will not leave you
we will go with you the princess
said with an air of dignity that sat well
on her talbot thought

  the soldier carrying the lamp lighted
the way at one side the officer led the
princess and talbot followed the guard
flanked them and brought up the rear

  can you guess whose house it is
talbot asked her in a low tone

  it may be one of my nobles but i
dont understand why he should not
tell us so she answered i am al-
most afraid again you wont leave
me but i know you wont

  while life lasts you may depend on
me sonia never doubt that

  she pressed his arm in assurance of
her trust in him he felt her tremble
nevertheless and it set his heart throb-
bing to realize how much he was to her
and that she trusted him so utterly

  excepting for his occasional whispers
of comfort the walk through the woods
was a silent one the officer evidently
had decided that it was better he should
not try to converse with the princess
he walked ahead without even looking
back

  after ten minutes walk the many
brilliantly lighted windows of the castle
came into view it was plainly a large
place and held many people

as they drew nearer music and sing-
ing could be heard as well as gay laugh-
talking talbot



ter and the shadows on the curtains of
the windows showed many rooms occu-
pied

  there is a great dinner party on to-
night the officer said turning and
saluting	 t

  and you will not tell me whose cas-
tle this is the princess said

  forgive me highness if i ask you
to wait you have no more humble
servant than  but  am sure i am doing
as my master would wish

  you are sure then that i shall be
among friends

  devoted friends your-your maj-
esty he answered lowering his voice
as if startled by his own boldness

  dont say that she cried clinging
fearfully to talbot and then whisper-
ing to him it must be the house of
one of my nobles oh sir chester
keep close to me i want to be brave
but  am afraid i fear others besides
my nobles

  at the main entrance they were left
on the driveway by the officer who had
first given orders to his men which re-
sulted in their gathering closer about
the two

  talbot looked at their guard won-
dering if it might be possible to break
through them and escape again but
when he saw how many of them there
were he realized that it would be a mad
thing to do if they were going to meet
avowed enemies the case would have
been different but it seemed quite cer-
tain that whover these people were they
wished the princess no harm so that it
would be wiser to accept the situation
now and escape later if need there were

  the substance of this he said to the
princess ije of good courage sonia
you may not like these people but it is
sure that they wish you no harm put a
good face on it whatever comes and
later if you wish it i will find a way
of escape for you are you feeling a
little braver now

  the fear comes suddenly and i for-

  get to be brave she answered 
shall be brave i think dont be
ashamed of me yet

  i shall never be ashamed of you
he said fervently i know that you
are a brave little woman

  i am trying she said softly

  the doors of the castle were thrown
open a burst of light flooding the scene
out of doors a large handsome man
as he seemed at first glance stepped to
the threshold and looked eagerly out

  the duke it is the duke wailed
the princess

chapter xi

  it did not take an instant for talbot
to realize what had happened they
had come upon the duke of jankovacz
in the midst of his friends after-
ward he learned that it was the dukes
own castle

  it was another kind of trouble but
at least it was not one that meant any
immediate danger for the princess and
was far preferable to the peril he had
rescued her from

  the duke was still standing in the
doorway peering out into the darkness
when talbot bent over the shrinking
girl and whispered play your part
boldly sonia be the princess you are
and trust to me we shall escape from
this as from the other

  he felt her press his arm and hearc
her murmur ill try then he saw
a glad smile break over the face of the
duke and saw him hurry down the
steps with outstretched hand

  he cried out something in hungarian
by way of joyous greeting and led her
up the steps with a ceremony that be-
trayed the importance he endowed her
with

  she was greeted with effusion and
respect by the little party of men who
had stood behind the duke and with
still more effusion and respect by the
throng of gayly dressed men and


peoples

women who had remained crowded
eagerly together a short distance away

  timid and shrinking at first the
princess cast a swift look back at tal-
bot and then accepted the greetings
with a dignity that gained a wonderful
charm from her sweet simplicity

  it was the most brilliant gathering
talbot had ever seen what with the
men in their gay and picturesque uni-
forms and the ladies in full dress

  the princess looked as out of place
as he knew she was feeling and he fol-
lowed slowly after her wondering how
he was going to make any headway
against so many

  he stood back and to one side unno-
ticed save for an occasional glance from
some one facing him in the throng the
duke maintained his place by the side
of the princess his handsome but dis-
sipated face glowing with delight as he
looked down at her

  there was much talk but it was all
in hungarian and therefore unintelli-
gible to talbot until the duke said
something that made the gay throng
open out before him and the princess
then she turned and looking straight
at talbot said in german

  i owe my liberty to this american
gentleman your highness this is herr
talbot herr talbot please come with
us

  she said this with a decision that
seemed amazing in her indeed it had
taken all her self-control to enable her
to do it rut the truth was that she
was afraid her courage would all go if
she were separated from talbot

  the american bowed composedly to
the duke whom he instinctively dis-
liked and went forward the duke
looking him up and down with a swift
glance knew him for a man to be met
on equal terms so stretched out his
hand in greeting

  talbot shook the almost royal hand
and turned to the princess at your
service highness

  a twitch of her red lip and a fleeting
dimple in her round cheek betrayed the
sense of her amusement at the sudden
formality of their relations

  we are most grateful to you herr
talbot for the service you have ren-
dered our beloved princess sonia
most grateful repeated the small
number of men who kept near all the
time

  the princess flashed a look of intel-
ligence at talbot and said some of
these gentlemen are nobles devoted to
the duke some are of my party i
presume they have come together to de-
vise measures for my rescue

  talbot was sure he saw some of the
faces flush at her words but the re-
sponse was quick and eager yes
highness yes

  luckily for me herr talbot was
there- said the princess her courage
high now and her manner oddly lofty
you wish to know the story of my
escape he shall tell it for he knows
it better than i shall i stand while
he recites it

  talbot saw that she was playing her
part as he had bidden her boldly and
like a princess and it amused him all
the more therefore to see the looks
of wonder that were exchanged among
the nobles

  shall we retire highness de-
manded the duke evidently taken
aback also by this unexpected exhibi-
tion of poise and dignity

  i presume they will all wish to
hear answered the princess looking
over the throng of ladies and gentle-
men whose lesser rank kept them at a
discreet distance

  there was an instant murmur of de-
sire from them to hear the story and
an equally swift frown of dislike from
the small group but talbot without
fully understanding saw that the prin-
cess wished to let all of them know
what had happened so seeing a large
talking talbot



chair hy the open fire in the hall he
quickly went to it and said

  if your highness wishes to sit here
is a chair

  the duke bent his head and whis-
pered something to her but with her
eyes fixed on talbot as if to maintain
her courage she shook her head and
said in a loud voice no highness

 prefer to tell it now and here all
of our friends will be curious and they
may as well hear the story at once
besides i am tired and cold

  the duke who was plainly a mas-
terful man bit his lip looked at the
high nobles near him shrugged his
shoulders and led her to the chair be-
side which talbot stood

  the princess began to undo the fas-
tenings of her coat but instantly was
surrounded by a group of ladies eager
to help her this act as much as
anything else impressed upon talbot
the knowledge of the princess im-
portance and his heart sank these
people must feel that the revolution was
almost accomplished to be so ready to
serve the princess in this eager way

  if you would like to make a toilet
first highness suggested one of the
nobles i am sure that among these
ladies there will be plenty with

which-

  all that her highness wishes if she
will put up with such poor things as
we have to offer cried the lady who
was fortunate enough to be assisting
her

  afterward the princess said seat-
ing herself comfortably in the big
chair wont you be seated high-
ness she said to the duke

  the duke bit his lip and looked
angrily about him but already a chair
was being brought in a few moments
he also was seated within the circle
that had been formed

  talbot saw how his heavy brows were
drawn down as he sat staring at the
princess who was exhibiting a side of

herself unknown to him then he felt
the searching glance bent on him
though he pretended unconsciousness
he was beginning to feel that the duke
was a man to fear as well as to dis-
like

  now will you tell them herr tal-
bot the princess said looking up at
him and smiling a bit tremulously

  she had been enjoying the play but
she too had caught the expression of
the duke and it recalled to her how
afraid of him she had been but there
was talbot-her sir chester-looking
cool and unconcerned as if in no wise
disturbed so she determined to go on
with courage

  she wished them all to hear the story
of the outrage on her because she was
afraid of the compromises the high no-
bles might be inclined to make for she
knew they were all afraid of the count-
ess elsa

  it was not much of a story tal-
bot said quietly i came upon her
highness quite by accident in the in-
closure of the castle of prince
szchymsl

  it was the prince then murmured
the duke exchanging glances with the
high nobles a low murmur came from
the other eager listeners

  it was the prince the princess said

  i was going to carry her off from
there talbot resumed which would
have been easy but she was taken to
the castle and put in a cell to be held
for court-martial

  an audible gasp came from the audi-
ence the duke bent suddenly forward
his eyes glowing

  are you sure of what you are say-
ing herr talbot he demanded

  yes replied talbot quietly i am
sure i am sure because i overheard
them planning it

  who demanded the duke

  the prince the countess elsa and
the others


peoples

  the countess elsa was there de-
manded the duke in a lower tone

  yes she was there and i knew from
what was said that the life of her
highness was in danger so i borrowed
the automobile of the prince and
brought her highness away

  there was a dead silence when he
ceased speaking and it was plain that
fear had fallen on them all the name
of the countess elsa was evidently
something to conjure with

  it seems very easy as he tells it
cried the princess what he doesnt
say is that he entered the castle broke
open the door of my cell captured the
countess elsa right in their midst and
single-handed took us both out of the
castle before the eyes of all those men

  you brought the countess elsa
away with you demanded the duke

  we left her on the way about
thirty miles from the castle i should
say talbot answered she prom-
ised to take no unfriendly step toward
her highness if i let her go

  she knew you would fall into the
hands either of the princes friends or
of the troops of the emperor said the
duke

  so i suspected therefore i let her

go

  every eye was on the man who spoke
so simply of the daring thing he had
done without in the least intending
it he looked the part of a hero of
romance as he stood there it wasnt
only the princess who thought him mag-
nificent

  one of the high nobles approached
the duke and said something in hun-
garian which made the duke start and
say to talbot you have done a great
service to-night herr talbot i hope
you will join us at dinner it will be
put off until you can change your
clothes-you and her highness i trust
you will permit me to supply the de-
ficiencies of your wardrobe i know
you will be glad to wait for her high-

ness fadies and gentlemen countess
turning to the lady who had assisted
the princess to take off her coat will
you see that her highness has proper
attention 

  talbot seeing that he and the prin-
cess would inevitably be separated bent
over her as if to make his obeisance
and whispered hastily brave little
sonia keep it up we shall escape
this

  she had turned pale at the thought
of being taken away but his words re-
assured her as she reflected that she
was perfectly safe there for a while
anyhow all she had to fear from the
duke was his determination to make
her his wife

  she rose and allowed herself to be
led upstairs talbot also was taken
upstairs and conducted to a room which
he was told was to be for his use

  valets came and brought him a choice
of many garments all of them absurdly
ornate he thought but he realized that
he must dress to appear in the dining
room in that gay company so he swal-
lowed his dislike of the comic-opera
clothes as he called them and allowed
himself to be shaved and arrayed in
some ones clothes

  he retained his money belt and car-
tridges and at the risk of being de-
tected with it slipped his revolver into
one of his hip pockets then feeling
ridiculous in the brilliant dress of an
officer of the army but admitting some-
what reluctantly that he did look well
he went downstairs to the hall where
he was cordially greeted

  the duke and his small group of high
nobles were not there but in a few
minutes a movement among the guests
indicated that something was happen-
ing and looking toward the grand
stairway he saw the princess an al-
most unbelievable vision of loveliness
coming down it

  she was in a low-cut gown of some
clinging stuff that exquisitely outlined
talking talbot



her supple rounded figure a band of
pearls sat like a crown on her brown
hair and a rope of pearls hung about
her white throat

  talbot caught his breath and a feel-
ing almost of despondency took pos-
session of him he could not fail to
see that nature had planned her for
the queenly role it was designed by
men that she should fill

  he stood moodily back but her eager
gray eyes searched about until they
found him when with a sigh that lifted
her snowy bosom her lips parted in a
smile of pleasure

  she went toward him at once swept
him with her eyes for an instant and
cried out now you are one of my
followers in your gallant uniform herr
talbot

  i was one before he answered
no she laughed drawing very near
to him you were leader before
then she lowered her voice my
party has increased in power it seems
and i am more important than ever
countess elsa is less to be feared other
things more to be feared i will play
my part as bravely as i can but you
must rescue me from the new peril or
life is worth nothing to me

  i am devoted as always highness
he answered in a whisper you can
depend on me

  she frowned and looked reproach-
fully at him since when have i
ceased to be sonia

  he drew a long breath you look
so royal he stammered

  i am only cowardly little sonia
whose surface courage is all due to
you she said tell me i am still
sonia to you

  you will always be sonia to me
the coming of the duke separated
them but enough had been said to re-
store to him his equanimity and he saw
her conducted to the dining hall by the
duke without disturbance of mind

  she certainly played her part right

royally as with her little hand resting
on the dukes arm she went the length
of the great room smiling graciously
at every one

  talbot watching her saw her stop
and look about before sitting down
he knew she was seeking him and
guessed in a moment that she was go-
ing to demand his presence near her
so when her eye caught his he shook
his head slightly

  she tossed her head and pouted her
red lips for an instant as if in rebel-
lion at his wish but suddenly smiled
and took her seat at the right hand of
the duke

  from where talbot sat he could see
her though the length of the table was
between them the master of cere-
monies had made his own judgment
of the social value of an american gen-
tleman even though dressed as a hun-
garian officer

  the dinner was a very merry one
with everybody drinking plentifully of
the delicious native wines and with
everybody smoking cigarettes during
the whole time

  it seemed to talbot who hardly
touched his glasses as they were filled
with the different wines that the duke
was doing more drinking than eating
and that he was beginning to feel the
effects of it

  he saw sonia flash a look of appeal
at him now and then but although he
hated the big handsome brute by her
side he knew he must restrain himself
and not betray any feeling

  after dinner the ladies left the men
at the table and then brandy and
liqueurs were brought and the duke
seemed to pour the brandy down his
throat

  this conduct manifestly disturbed the
high nobles and one of them whispered
what must have been a remonstrance
the duke fell back in his chair and
broke into a loud laugh saying loud
enough to be heard by all in the room 


peoples

  dont worry im drinking to the
bride

  talbot couldnt help but understand
that this referred to the princess and
it made him desperately uneasy he
knew that a marriage between the two
was contemplated

  he had promised to stand by sonia
and at any cost he meant to do it but
he realized his insignificance there in
the midst of all these people in the
heart of a strange country surrounded
and hemmed in by the armies of the
empire

  the duke sought out the princess the
moment he left the dining hall and
talbot was obliged to stand aloof and
see him bend amorously over the shrink-
ing grl- 

  the princess seeing at a glance that
the duke had been drinking too freely
started up from her chair and drew
back casting an appealing glance about
her and betraying what it was she
sought by the relief she shotved when
her eyes fell on talbot standing stem
and grim not far from her

  she made a scarcely perceptible sign
to him to come to her and reckless of
consequences he had started when a
restraining hand was placed  his arm
he looked around and saw that it was
one of the high nobles who had stopped
him

  well sir he demanded sharply

  the other was a distinguished-look-
ing man of about fifty with a keen
intelligent face and the manner of one
accustomed to authority he smiled
suavely as he met the cold blue eyes
a few words with you herr talbot
he said

  a very few please the princess
wishes to speak to me

  and it is precisely of that that i
wish to talk with you was the smiling
response will you not come over
here and sit down with me

  talbot studied him for a moment his
face unsmiling his eyes unpleasantly

cold i will talk with you when i
have learned what her highness wishes
of ine he answered and started to-
ward her

  i can tell you what she wishes

  i prefer to hear it from her own
lips

  you would intrude on the dulce
the other demanded a note of anger
in his voice

  i do not intrude when i obey her
highness wishes he stopped how-
ever for he saw the princess elude the
reaching hand of the duke and come
toward him

  the noble seeing what had happened
waited beside talbot until the princess
panting but with eyes sparkling an-
grily reached them then he spoke
to her in hungarian evidently convey-
ing reproach if not reproof she an-
swered him in german

  he is drunk  will not have him
paw me i will not endure it

 the noble answered her in hun-
garian she drew a deep breath looked
into talbots set face and said angrily
speak in german since herr talbot
does not understand hungarian

 and why must herr talbot know
what we say	

  because t wish it for one thing
for another because he rescued me from
death when my party friends would
have left me  to die i trust herr
talbot

  there was silence then talbot
looked anxiously about the situation
was becoming tense the duke with
flushed face and slightly swaying body
was approaching the noble was furi-
ous at the open rebellion of the hitherto
docile princess the princess was
alarmed at her own temerity

  at this moment there was a sudden
bustle at the other end of the great
salon and the noble turning to see
what it was cried out in a tone of
relief the archbishop

  the archbishop gasped the prin-
talking talbot



cess catching at talbots arm why
is he here

  is he not one of your highness ad-
herents the noble said with an enig-
matic smile

  ha ha roared the duke stopping
beside them and looking at the prelate
welcome monseigneur

  he added more but as he spoke in
hungarian talbot understood only the
first words then he saw the princess
turn pale and shrink close to him and
by that knew that the words had to do
with her

  he has come to marry me to him
she breathed looking up appealingly at
talbot

chapter xii

  it cant be done without your con-
sent talbot said firmly enough though
in his heart he was not sure

  the prelate a tall portly man of im-
posing presence was slowly approach-
ing them as they stood a group apart
in the vast salon he bowed and smiled
graciously as he rroved along and tal-
bot was quick to see that here was a
force greater than any he had yet en-
countered

  save me sir chester moaned the
soft voice of the princess

  refuse to marry him he said in a
whisper do nothing without me by
your side

  he was at his wits end and was
nervously feeling of his hidden revolver
though he knew very well it was not
force that was needed now

  the archbishop reached them he
greeted the duke cordially though lift-
ing his brows on seeing that he was the
worse for what he had been drinking
the princess he seemed unfeignedly
pleased to see

  why highness he said benevo-
lently i heard you were missing yet
here you are in the flesh and lovelier
than ever

i was missing and i would be dead

now monseigneur she answered with
recovered courage if it had not been
for this gentleman herr talbot an
american gentleman monseigneur
what are you saying he demanded
of her as he put out his large white
hand to talbot you would have
been dead what do you mean

 i was in the power of prince
szchymsl and countess elsa and i was
about to be court-martialed and exe-
cuted when this gentleman saved me
we have heard that story too often
already highness interposed the duke
coarsely the gentleman shall have
his reward let us get to the business
in hand

 what business she demanded
she kept close enough to talbot to be
able to reach out to him in case of need

  the duke laughed and lurched to-
ward her she uttered a little cry and
drew aside he almost lost his balance
but recovered himself with a frown
and muttered something in hungarian

  ill not be married the princess
cried as if in response to what he had
said

  highness remonstrated the noble
who had tried to keep talbot from her
the other high nobles who had joined
the group murmured among them-
selves

  my dear princess said the arch-
bishop you are not in earnest

  i am  will not marry the duke
look at him

  he was standing unsteadily opposite
her leering in a most unpleasant
fashion the archbishop looked and
bit his lip

  let us have a private conference
said the noble who had already spoken

  an excellent idea agreed the arch-
bishop heartily

  quite right said the duke thickly
come gentlemen

you will come too highness
rather commanded than asked the noble
the princess put her trembling band


peoples

out and laid it oil talbots arm and
herr talbot too

  herr talbot has no concern with
this

  if i wish it he has she replied
her courage remaining with her and
i do wish it  without him i will not
go to your conference

  i trust herr talbot vill see the

impropriety-

  i see no impropriety in doing what
her highness wishes he interrupted in
an icy tone

  really gentlemen expostulated the
prelate i do not see what harm there
can be in the presence of this gentle-
man if her highness wishes to have
him there

  you dont understand
gentlemen said talbot impressive
in his cold impassive way you may
as well understand that i am her high-
ness devoted servant and will carry
out her wishes

  he looked so extremely capable as
he faced them all that the duke shrugged
his shoulders and muttered something
in hungarian talbot felt sonias fin-
gers tighten on his arm she said noth-
ing however and he could only guess
it was a threat the duke had muttered

  come then if you will have it so
the noble said we are making a spec-
tacle here

  may i have the pleasure highness
asked the archbishop bowing in his
magnificent way he turned she took
her place beside him and the entire
party went to a room across the hall

  there was silence while chairs were
brought from different parts of the
room and the members of the party
seated themselves

  the duke had passed into a moody
stage and was glowering at talbot
the nobles were exchanging angry and
determined glances and the archbishop
was serenely complimenting the prin-
cess on her appearance she and tal-
bot a few chairs apart were exchang-

ing glances-of encouragement on his
part of appeal on hers

  will you open the conference
count szolnak  said one of the nobles
seeing that the duke was determinedly
silent

  the noble who had already taken the
lead in the matter glanced around as
if to obtain the assurance that it was
the wish of the assemblage that he
should do so

  the situation is most simple he
said the condition of the empire is
such that a separation of austria and
hungary is only a question of time
there are practically only two parties
in hungary the smaller one hoping
for a republic the larger one demand-
ing a constitutional monarchy

  the monarchical party is divided in
a sense between those who wish to see
his higness the duke of jankovacz on
the throne and those who wish to see
her highness the princess sonia ko-
torska there

  for a time there was conflict be-
tween these two parties but now the
leaders of both parties have come to-
gether and have decided that the wel-
fare of our beloved country demands
the union of the two aspirants to the
throne to the end that there may be
no sinful waste of blood

  the marriage of the duke and the
princess will bring instant peace to the
country and this marriage has been
agreed upon by the leaders that i
believe is the present state of affairs
excepting that i neglected to state that
advices from all over the country as-
sure us that such a solution will meet
with enthusiastic approval

  i will not marry him the princess
said her face white

  you were willing once why do you
refuse now demanded count szolnak
with difficulty restraining his anger

  surely my child remonstrated the
archbishop in his most paternal man-
ner you dont wish to plunge the coun-
talking talbot



try into the horrors of civil war is
not the present war shocking enough
it will not create a civil war she
answered quickly  renounce any
pretension i have to the throne in favor
of his highness i will not marry him
at least give us a reason pleaded
the archbishop

  look at him she cried

  they all looked involuntarily at the
duke he was still glowering at tal-
bot but in a purposeless way and with
his body swaying slightly as if he were
trying to balance himself his face
was inflamed and his lips loosely apart

  the archbishop bit his lip and the
others turned their eyes sullenly away
from him

  is this a common love affair cried
out count szolnak are high state
matters to be made dependent on the
whim of a foolish child yes high-
ness a foolish child  would you sac-
rifice a throne for yourself and plunge
your country into a bloody war because
his highness had taken a drop too much
wine enough of this it is your duty
to marry the duke

  i will not she reiterated her face
whiter and whiter and her eyes con-
stantly seeking talbots as for him
he felt his powerlessness but sat there
ready at any moment to make the best
fight he could

  monseigneur cried count szolnak
you came here to unite these two and
thereby serve our beloved hungary i
beg you to do it

  princess said the prelate sternly
i cannot believe you will hold out
against the wishes of the statesmen of
the country and refuse to do that which
will bring us peace in spite of the war
now raging and spare us the more hor-
rible conflict among ourselves

  oh sir chester help me she
wailed

  he rose and went over and stood
beside her i am a stranger here from
another land he said but her high-

ness has chosen me to protect her from
the evils which threaten her

  if you are wise you will not meddle
with what does not concern you herr
talbot cried count szolnak

  it concerns me when the princess
asks my help you who think her so
important now did not raise a hand
to save her when prince szchymsl car-
ried her off you feared him and you
feared the countess elsa i feared
neither of them nor their power any
more than i fear you and your power
now you would sacrifice her to that
brute of a man who will not keep sober
even when he is looking forward to
such a bride what sort of life are
you dooming this delicate creature to
shame on you

  the nobles stared aghast at this ar-
raignment of them the archbishop
moistened his lips and looked at the
speaker in shocked amazement but into
the brain of the swaying duke stupid
with alcohol there must have flashed
a consciousness of what talbot was
saying for without a word or gesture
of warning he suddenly leaped to his
feet and hurled himself at talbot

  talbot saw and acted he stepped
forward slightly and shot out his right
fist the duke caught on the point of
the jaw fell back on the thick rug
senseless

  a cry of rage and horror broke from
the others some of them sprang to
help the duke some of them looked as
if minded to leap on talbot one of
them glided to the table and pressed
an electric button

  the princess had thrown herself into
the arms of her champion and he had
held her for a moment close to him
soothing her terror then he disen-
gaged his right arm and found his re-
volver

  what to do he didnt know he was
thinking of going to the door and try-
ing to escape from the house it
seemed so hopeless that he was hardly


peoples

disappointed when the door opened and
a footman appeared

  a squad of soldiers quickly com-
manded the noble who had touched the
button

  a long-drawn sigh of relief and tri-
umph came from the men in the room
that was the way to deal with this
preposterous interloper

  talbot considered the door again
this was the most desperate case they
had yet been in if they tried to escape
through the salon these men would set
up such an outcry that their way would
inevitably be blocked and it was use-
less to think of using his revolver he
might threaten with it but there would
always be the soldiers to reckon with

  there remained the windows of the
room how high were they from the
ground outside was there a moat

  come sonia he said to her draw-
ing her toward one of the windows
she followed him willingly frightened
but confident that her splendid knight
would find a way out of the trouble

  but he felt more and more doubtful
how could he take her out into the
cold in that scant dress how could
he ask her to walk the rough ways in
those dainty satin slippers

  then he remembered that there would
surely be horses in plenty and heavy
coats of one kind and another if only
be could get out and hold these men
at bay

  watch them and tell me if they
come near sonia he whispered and
began to work at the fastenings of the
window the curtains he had flung
aside

  it was a french window opening to
the floor the fastenings were of the
familiar french kind and were soon
undone the window opened talbot
looked back at the men no one there
was making any effort to hold him and
on the faces of some he saw a sardonic
smile

  when he leaned out he understood

there was a black void there he would
have ventured for himself but he could
not ask her to take such a risk if
only he had had his rope with him
but he hadnt

  he turned back to the room the
duke was still unconscious but show-
ing signs of life two of the nobles
had gone to the door and were waiting
there

  he looked at sonia she stood there
trembling but trustful as a child she
looked into his eyes and tried to smile

  brave little sonia he murmured
i am going to fail you at last

  we cannot escape that way she
asked

  it is very high

  he was scanning the room looking
for a suggestion time was flying and
the soldiers might come at any time
suddenly he remembered how he had
used the countess elsa and in half a
dozen leaps he was by the side of the
duke

  he tossed the nobles aside as if they
had been children and just as the door
opened to admit the soldiers he picked
up the heavy body of the duke and ran
with it to a corner of the room

  the princess had followed him at
every step and now was close by his
side he put her behind him and
holding the body of the duke before him
as a shield cried out to the dumfounded
men i will kill the duke if you force
me to it

  the soldiers filed into the room look-
ing in amazement at the man at bay in
the corner the officer waited for or-
ders through the now open door of
the salon the curious throng of guests
could be seen peering into the room

  the nobles conscious of the absurd
position they had been put in by this
maneuver of talbots consulted to-
gether for a moment

  wait outside said szolnak to the
officer and close the door

  the squad of soldiers filed impas-
talking talbot



sively out again szolnak turned to
talbot and studied bis stern face

  well he said  what do you expect
to gain by this

  freedom or death was the calm
response freedom under guarantee
for the princess and me or death to
the duke and as many more as my re-
volver will account for and i am in
the habit of making every bullet tell
my dear man exclaimed the arch-
bishop in a tone of remonstrance you
are acting in a very high-handed man-
ner you come here a perfect stranger
and interfere with the operations of a
whole government why not take your
friends and leave us to deal with our
problems ourselves you would be
wiser

  the oply thing that concerns me is
the welfare of the princess answered
talbot she doesnt wish to marry the
duke nor does she wish to sit on the
throne so it is you who are unreason-
able in trying to force her to do so
and if we agreed to your outrageous
terms what must b done asked szol-
nak what will you do what do
you expect of us

  i wish to go free from this place
with the princess i wish a pair of
horses to ride my clothes and the
clothes and wraps of the princess and
your oaths not to molest us

  szolnak turned to the others and
talked with them in low tones then
turned to talbot again what will
you do with the duke

  let him lie on the floor i wish him
no harm

  very well if the princess will as-
sure us once more that she really re-
fuses to succor her bleeding country
we will agree to your terms how is
it highness do you desert us now
are you without regard for your coun-
try you have no gratitude to us who
have done so much for you

  the princess her courage quite re-
stored by this new victory of her cham-


pion over such overwhelming odds
stepped out f rom behind talbot and an-
swered firmly

  this is not my country as you very-
well know i am a bosnian far more
than a hungarian you have done
nothing for me but on the contrary
have done much to injure me by drag-
ging me from my happy obscurity to
compel me to marry a man i loathe
and to fill a position i have no fitness
for i am not deserting yrou when 
go back to my home

  so be it szolnak turned to his
companions we must do without her
then get the clothes of these two and
have two horses saddled he indi-
cated the ones he would have execute
the errands and the nobles set out at
once

  talbot dryly interposed you might
let the archbishop administer the oath
to these gentlemen before they leave
the room not that i suspect you of
contemplating anything dishonorable
but it is just as well to have them in-
cluded in the oath

  the nobles stood together before the
archbishop who after a few moments
of reflection voiced the following
words which were repeated after him
by the others

  we nobles of hungary individu-
ally and collectively do hereby take
solemn oath before almighty god that
we will take no step to prevent the de-
parture from this castle of the princess
sonia kotorska and herr talbot an
american gentleman that we will fur-
nish two properly equipped horses for
them and restore their clothing that
we will take no steps to have them in-
tercepted outside of these grounds
they all took this oath and crossed
themselves talbot at once carried the
duke nearer the table and placed him
on the rug then returned to the prin-
cess the two nobles left the room to
have the horses made ready and to get
the clothing


peoples

  i hope you will let us wear what
we have on for the time being talbot
said we will return everything
later

  you may keep them or give them
away szolnak said indifferently

  the door of the room had been left
open again and talbot could see that
the soldiers had been sent away every-
thing seemed to be done in good faith
but he had an uneasy feeling that all
was not well yet

  how splendid you are sir ches-
ter the princess murmured you
are greater than an army you always
succeed

  wait little sonia he answered
we are not away yet

  his suspicions seemed to be rebuked
however when the clothes were brought
in bundles suitable for carrying on
horseback themselves covered by their
outer clothing and the way out through
the salon left open to them

  talbot had slipped his revolver in
his coat pocket and held it there ready
for use the guests who had welcomed
them so heartily early in the evening
now watched them in silent wonder as
they passed through the salon the prin-
cess clinging to his arm

  on the driveway in front of the great
doors stood two horses ready saddled
talbot lifted the princess into her sad-
dle and then put his foot in his own
stirrup at that instant he was sur-
rounded dragged back and in spite of
his furious struggles securely bound

  the princess was lifted from her
horse and carried into the house too
stupefied to utter a sound after one
cry of dismay at the sight of her cham-
pion rendered helpless

  both of them were taken back into
the room of the conference and the
door shut the princess was seated in
a chair but no restraint was put upon
her talbot was also placed in a chair
but he was left securely bound

chapter xiii

  you have broken your oaths you
have dishonored yourselves the prin-
cess cried starting up from her chair
monseigneur what infamy

  sit down my child said the prel-
ate and try to be reasonable no
oath has been broken there was 
promise that nothing would happen to
you within the grounds

  you absolve them she gasped in-
credulously 

  there is nothing to absolve he
answered smiling benevolently he
turned to the smiling nobles i leave
the matter in your hands now

  the princess stared at them for a
moment then started toward talbot
szolnak interposed with outstretched
arms no highness i regret the
necessity but you must have no more
to do with him

  she looked as if she contemplated a
struggle two of the others placed
themselves beside szolnak she sank
back in her chair casting a glance at
talbot

  talbot had not uttered a word as yet
he had been looking about wondering
what would happen next trying to see
some way out of the tangle he noted
that the duke was no longer in the
room he was sure he saw signs of
some definite purpose in the conduct
of these men

  have good courage highness he
said as if in response to her look

  szolnak whispered to one of his com-
panions who went out and returned
with the lieutenant who had been in
charge of the soldiers who had cap-
tured them

  draw your sword and guard that
man lieutenant and tell me are
you one of his highness men
devoted to the death

  and if you are ordered to run him
through the heart will you do it with-
out question
talking talbot



  if his highness commands it
no no no cried the princess
starting up again frantically you
shall not hurt him you shall not

  that is a matter which is entirely
at your disposal the noble said care-
fully standing in front of her if you
will listen to reason nothing shall hap-
pen to him otherwise he shall die as
the spy and the traitor he is

  what do you wish she faltered
you know well what we wish high-
ness you know what the whole coun-
try is wishing there is one thing that
will unite thei factions and the people
-your marriage with the duke

  oh no  oh no  i cannot she
moaned

  then you wish this man killed
what no no no what are you
saying he-he rescued me he is my
champion

  he is a foolish meddler was the
cold response but he shall be sent
back to his own country if you will
consent to wed the duke

  no no it is monstrous oh sir
chester

  refuse princess- he said

  if you do not consent he shall die
and if he dies it will be by your will
highness szolnak was implacably in
earnest

  at this juncture the duke entered the
room all traces of his previous intox-
ication were gone he stood in the
center of the room and looked trium-
phantly from the princess to the bound
figure of talbot

  so he said malevolently the in-
terfering spy and traitor is in our haqds
why is he not disposed of

  we are using him in our argument
with her highness

  and what is the argument  he de-
manded curtly

  we are trying to persuade her to
consent to her marriage to you and
we are promising that he shall return
to his own country if she will consent

  is her consent necessary he de-
manded red in the face with anger
must the welfare of the country wait
on the whim of a foolish girl what
do you say monseigneur 

  her consent is absolutely essential
highness

  then let her decide quickly since
this fellows life is of such consequence
to her this matter must be settled
at once time is of the utmost im-
portance

  szolnak turned again to the princess
who had listened breathlessly to all that
had been said our opinion coincides
with that of his highness you must
decide at once officer are you
ready

  the lieutenant whose face had be-
come very pale during this conversa-
tion turned to the duke and saluted
saying at your service highness
do as the count bids you growled
the duke

  the lieutenant saluted the count
szolnak and faced talbot with drawn
sword the count once more faced the
princess

  she dropped into the chair again and
covered her face with her hands for
a few moments not a sound was to be
heard in the room save the heavy
breathing of the men who were all
tensed with excitement

  the princess let her hands fall into
her lap and looked piteously into the
various faces when they came to tal-
bot they rested there for a space if
-if i consent she said do you swear
you will set him free

  yes

  without subterfuge you-you will
keep your oaths this time

  you he shall word the oath and
we will take it in the most solemn way
monseigneur can devise

 then-then she cried wildly

ttj	m

  stop shouted talbot do you
think  would accept life at such a


peoples

price you shall not do it princess
besides do you believe such sorry trick-
sters would play fair they would kill
me anyhow

  they will swear to set you free
she faltered

  i will so word their oath that there
can be  loophole said the arch-
bishop

  you are too clever at the making of
oaths returned talbot with stinging
scorn have nothing to do with them
princess my life is nothing in com-
parison with your life spent with that
sottish brute

  what roared the duke fairly pur-
ple in the face

  let them kill me i shall count it
a small thing if suffered for you be-
sides you cannot trust them they are
such skillful liars

  choking with rage the duke would
have interposed with a furious order
 the lieutenant but for the calming
hand of szolnak  his arm

  let him talk highness he said
ft is better that he should make every
possible representation to the princess
in order that what we say and do will
have more weight

  talbot took him at his word and
went on bear this in mind princess
my death would be swift and easy
your life would be a prolonged hell with
that beast be brave for the last time
and you will never regret it

  i cannot let you die she sobbed
i would live the remainder of my life
in agony and remorse oh she
pleaded with szolnak let me go to
him and i will persuade him i will
marry the duke then

  szolnak stood aside with a trium-
phant bow the princess tottered
across the room to talbot and stood
beside him supporting herself by the
back of his chair

  you will retire a little way she
said coaxingly to the lieutenant

  the young man who was already

trembling with emotion bowed and
went some yards away without even
asking by a look for permission from
his superiors

  talbot was devouring the lovely face
of the princess she followed the
movements of the lieutenant and then
looked down into talbots eyes

  oh sir chester she said softly
sobbing gently all the while do not
ask me to see you die to know that
a word from me could save you i
know these men they are mad with
ambition and would count your life as
nothing i cannot do it you must live
 will demand to see you set on a horse
and given pledges before i will wed
him

  no he said firmly i will not con-
sent

  but you must you have done so
much for me already do not stop at
such a little thing if you die i will
kill myself i swear i will i am a
little coward but i shall have the cour-
age for that you have been every-
thing to me you have changed me from
a girl without spirit to a woman
whose courage grows with every min-
ute she is with you if you die i die
with you and you know i will keep
my word

  little sonia he said i could not
live and know that you were in the
arms of that beast perhaps if i-if

i- he stopped and bit his lip to

keep from going on

  if you what sir chester she
asked bending over him

  perhaps if i tell you something you
will-let me have my way

  i think nothing can make me change
my mind she answered sadly

  i have known you such a shorl
time sonia really only a few hours

  tt seems as if we had always known
each other she said

  yes it seems so to me i am an
ordinary man an american but in my
own country the equal of any other
talking talbot



while you are a princess with royal
blood in your veins

  such a poor little princess she
sighed

  but there is a throne waiting for
you a throne which  think may be
yours without this marriage with the
duke

   dont want a throne sir chester
all i want is to know that you are alive
and well

  but you are a princess and you may
be a queen and that is why i am guilty
of a great presumption

  of what are you speaking she
asked wonderingly

  i am going to tell you that noble
as you are and short as is the time i
have known you i love you

  you love me she breathed softly
and looked into his eyes with an ex-
pression of ineffable wonder and joy
you love me 

  i cant help it sonia

  oh she murmured isnt that
beautiful you love me you the
most splendid man in the world love
me

  he looked into her face and won-
dered at what he saw there for the
instant both of them forgot the hope-
lessness of the situation

  you dont mean sonia- he be-
gan

  you love me she repeated softly
as if overcome by the marvel of such
a thing coming into her life

  and you sonia he asked eagerly
do you love me

  from the first moment always now
and forever

  kiss me dearest he said

  she bent over him wound her arms
about his neck and pressed his lips
with hers

  at this there was a furious outcry
and a rush toward them sonia was
snatched away from him and the duke
tearing the sword out of the hand of

the young soldier rushed at talbot to
thrust it through him

  the princess saw his intention sooner
than any one else she broke loose
from the men who held her and threw
herself before talbot

  you shall not she cried passion-
ately i love him

  in his mad fury the duke raised the
sword as if he would strike her szol-
nak caught his arm and held it

  are you mad highness he said
in a low tone are you fighting for
a kingdom or for the love of a silly
girl 

  the duke listened and flung the
sword away great drops of perspira-
tion broke out on his forehead he
turned away saying hoarsely make
an end of this at once

  the others grouped themselves in
front of sonia as she stood protect-
ingly in front of talbot szolnak
looked curiously at her for a moment
and then addressed her quietly

  you said highness that if we let
you talk with him you would marry the
duke well you have talked with him
she stared at him for a moment as
if she were coming back from another
world and had quite forgotten the
events of this one the next moment
she smiled scornfully

  if i were like you she said i
would remind you that i said that i
would marry the duke if i could per-
suade-she turned and smiled lovingly
at talbot-if i could persuade sir
chester i could not persuade him i
will not even try to persuade him

  do you mean- broke in szolnak

she made a gesture of silence

  i mean that he and i will die to-
gether if you wish it but that i will
not marry the duke

  my brave sonia  murmured talbot
oh i would learn to be so i am
sure she smiled turning to look at
him if only there were time

 do i understand that you posi-


peoples

tively refuse to marry the duke de-
manded szolnak

  positively

  gentlemen he said sharply turn-
ing to the other nobles i regret to
ask you to lay hands on your future
queen but there is no other way will
you kindly take her away from him

  as gently as was compatible with the
force exerted two of the nobles dragged
her away from talbot

  szolnak went to the officer who hav-
ing recovered his jword had been
watching the scene in amazement and
took his sword from him

  please wait outside the door he
said the officer saluted and left the
room

  szolnak now went over to talbot
with a firm decided step and opened
his coat inner coat and waistcoat and
finally his shirt so that the flesh of his
breast was bare

  monseigneur he said you know
as we all know that it is essential for
the good of hungary that the princess
sonia kotorska wed the duke of jan-
kovacz she refuses and lets us know
that she loves this man and would
rather die with him than do her duty

  you have stated the case correctly
and succinctly replied the archbisbop

  as a patriot szolnak went on i
cannot permit the princess to make such
a choice therefore i shall take such
steps as will convince her of her error

  the princess had struggled very little
when taken from talbot she had
shuddered when she saw his garments
opened to bare his great chest but she
had not moved now she gave a cry
broke away and ran to talbot throw-
ing herself upon him

  she had acted without reason but
it seemed to her that she must protect
him

  what shall i do what shall i
do she moaned in his ear

  be brave there is nothing else you
can do dearest then he raised his

voice and addressed them all you
have the power and you may kill me
but you know as well as i that you
cannot compel her to marry the duke
and i whom she loves beg her to be
firm i even forbid her by the right
of my love to wed him and after
that what if i am not mistaken her
friends are more powerful than the
dukes now in which case beware of
the consequences of what you do

  they tore her away from him and
held her firmly at the request of szol-
nak who once more approached near
to talbot

  the fact that what you say is more
or less true he said is the very reason
why the princess must marry the duke
and i hope to be able to persuade her
he turned to the princess and in a
cold hard tone said to her high-
ness this is not a time for hesitation
and i shall not hesitate i warn you
that this man shall die before your eyes
if you do not consent to wed the duke
and wed him at once will you do it

  by your love for me refuse cried
talbot

  she looked at him and she looked
at szolnak she knew the merciless
quality of these men so well she had
been a puppet in their hands far too
long for her to be in ignorance

  i-i refuse she faltered

  without another word szolnak put
the point of the sword on the white
breast of the helpless man sonia
screamed in agony the noble turned
and looked inquiringly at her

  well  he said

  be firm dearest said talbot al-
though the prick of the point was al-
ready painful

  oh my love she panted strug-
gling furiously with the men who held
her oh my dear love

  szolnak ground his jaws together
and pushed until the point entered the
flesh and the red blood began to flow

  no no screamed sonia stop
talking talbot



stop i cant stand it ill do what
you ask forgive me dear yes take
that sword away i tell you i will do
what you ask but you must let me
go to him you must  must go
to him i say

  she struggled so like a madwoman
that the men let her go she ran fran-
tically and before any one could stop
her had put her lips to the wound one
little hand reaching up and tremulously
patting his cheek

  talbot managed to turn his face so
that he could kiss the soft fluttering
little hand then he turned his eyes
on the group of nobles and said in such
tones of implacable purpose that there
was none that was not affected  you
curs hear what i say if you do not
kill me i swear by all i hold dear that
i will kill that sodden brute who is
called the duke of jankovacz he
softened his voice and murmured ten-
derly to the sobbing sonia the
wound is nothing sweetheart dont
fret for me let them wed you to the
duke since you cannot endure to see
me die but believe me when i say that
i will kill him you will not have to
endure him long dearest

  you will hate me she wailed but
i cannot bear this

  i shall not hate you dear i shall
always love you do what you think
is best i think you foolish to wed
him but if you cannot endure to see
them kill me then let the bishop do
his foul work

  she was holding her dainty handker-
chief over his wound now and looking
up at him with the tears streaming
down her face

  could you endure to see me dying
under your eves when a word from you
could stop it

  no dearest he answered tenderly
i am sure i would do as you decide
to do but will it do any good do
you believe they will dare to spare me
you know how utterly false they are

  you shall be spared szolnak said
i will see to it myself that you are
taken to cither italy or switzerland

  it does not matter to me talbot
said indifferently you have heard my
oath and  think you know that i keep
my oaths

  if ever you set foot in hungary
again snarled the duke that instant
you will die let us get on with this
interesting wedding count szolnak
forgive me dear sobbed sonia
i wish i could be braver but i cannot
i know  would yield the moment i saw
your dear blood flow

  you are as brave as you are beauti-
ful my sonia i could say no more
than that dont think of me any
more

  i shall always think of you

  and i of you dear but since you
must do this let it be done quickly
put no obstacles in their way

  but sonia would do nothing until
every man in the room had sworn the
most solemn and particular oath that
talbot should be placed safely in either
italy or switzerland as he elected

  then unhindered by them she
bound up his wound which was very
trifling and then kissed him tenderly
on the lips

  it is good-by dear she said the
tears streaming down her fair checks
yes sweetheart i know it is
you will not forget me

  never

chapter xiv

  the princess turned to szolnak set
him free since i have given you my
promise

  no cried the duke he shall not
be freed until after the ceremony lias
been performed

  you see dear said talbot how
plain it is that there is no intention of
keeping their promise

  you have our inviolable oath high-


peoples

ness interposed szolnak with an im-
patient glance at the duke you can
trust us

  talbot laughed scornfully what
does it matter dear if you trust them
at all which is folly why not trust
them altogether  besides it will not
matter in the end

  no murmured the princess in
the end it will not matter let the
ceremony go on then she said in a
louder tone

  talbot always watching the beautiful
face saw by its expression that sonia
had made a supreme decision he
raged to have to sit there utterly help-
less while she fought a hopeless fight
for his life

  her highness cannot be wedded in
that gown the archbishop said point-
ing to the stains of blood that were on
it moreover such a ceremony should
be public particularly as the guests out
there must be wild to know what is
going on in here

  you are right monseigneur an-
swered szolnak after an exchange of
glances with the other nobles high-
ness will you -cover your gown wih
your coat so that its condition may not
be noticed and then be so good as to
make a new toilet

  you are wasting time said the
duke savagely what does it matter
how her gown looks as for the guests
half of them have fled panic-stricken
already those who remain suspect a
part of what has happened they do
not know that the princess has de-
graded herself with that fellow but they
know she was trying to avoid this mar-
riage

  the more reason highness why the
wedding should be as public as possi-
ble besides the more witnesses the
more there are irrevocably committed
to us

  whatever you do hurry said the
duke impatiently

  talbot nursing a terrible wrath in

his breast was nevertheless all the
while racking his brains for some plan
of action he had strained at his bonds
without effect now an idea came to
him

  since in your mercy you have de-
cided not to murder me he cried sud-
denly is there any reason why i
should be trussed up like this it is
neither necessary nor agreeable

  youll do well as you are growled
the duke

  he must be unbound said the
princess passionately turning to go to
him

  szolnak interposed i will see that
he is made comfortable highness if
you will go make a toilet

  sonia with a look of high resolve
that talbot could not fathom permitted
herself to be led from the room by one
of the nobles szolnak at once rear-
ranged talbots bonds so that only his
hands were tied

  after this the young lieutenant was
brought in to guard talbot while the
others went into the salon to make such
explanations as they saw fit and thus
prepare the way for the wedding

  talbot on pretense of stretching after
the painful stricture of his limbs put all
the pressure he could on the cord at
his wrists he had already tensed his
arm muscles and held his wrists as far
apart as possible when they were being
tied so that he had hopes of ultimately
freeing his hands that done he would
know what to do

  they had not taken his revolver from
him not knowing that he had it on his
person or having forgotten it

  he was still making quiet but inef-
fectual efforts to loosen the cord when
the door was thrown open and the
lieutenant was bidden to bring his pris-
oner into the salon

  many of the guests had gone but so
many remained that there was still a
large and brilliant gathering in the great
talking talbot



hall they all looked at him with a
new curiosity

  sonia had not come down yet but
the others were there in full view of
talbot who had been so placed that any
effort to escape could easily be blocked
besides a file of soldiers stood at the
door leading from the salon to the hall

  the archbishop in all the robes of
his office stood a little apart talking
with the duke and szolnak

  before many minutes sonia accom-
panied by two ladies came into the
room she was very unlike the timid
girl of the old garden talbot thought
her gown was not unlike the one she
had just worn but was a pale yellow
she wore no jewels at all

  it was her manner that made the
great difference she bore herself with
a sort of fierce pride when she en-
tered the room she stopped and looked
imperiously about only when her eyes
fell on talbot did her face soften

  disregarding everybody else she
went directly to him waving szolnak
aside when he attempted to interpose

  i will have my way she said

  why create a scandal he asked in
a low tone

  any scandal is of your making she
said and passed on

  she looked wonderfully beautiful as
she approached talbot but he could see
that her resolve whatever its nature
had only hardened in the interval how
happy he and she might have been he
thought but for these meddlers oh
if only the cord would give

  sir she said to the lieutenant re-
tire a few paces and when he had
done so her face relaxed in a sad sweet
smile dear one she murmured to
talbot this is my farewell i am sure
i am doing the only thing i could do
but do not doubt me no other kiss
but yours shall ever touch my lips i
am a coward now only in my inability
to see you suffer in other things i
know i shall be brave i am glad you

came to me love is worth everything
let me press your lips once more

  she bent forward and with her hands
on his shoulders pressed his lips with
hers

  there was a cry of rage from the
duke and a murmur of wonder went
through the whole assemblage

  good-by sweetheart he said it
may be for a long time or for a short
one i can see that you have some des-
perate plan in your mind wait two
days at least give me that much
time

  i will if i can she answered

  they exchanged one more look in
which it seemed to both of them as if
the whole religion of love was revealed
then she turned and went to where the
archbishop stood

  i am ready she said to him to
the duke she said you may win a
crown by this you will not get a wife

  he looked her over with a glance at
once wrathful and appraising i will
take the risk of that he said

  they took their places side by side
and a hush fell on the room it was
as if the strangeness of the wedding
oppressed their spirits the prelate
took his place in front of the couple
and looked about him as if he would
call attention to the fact that to him
there was nothing unusual in the situ-
ation

  at that moment there was a com-
motion in the hall the duke looked
toward the door in annoyance

  hurry monseigneur said szolnak
in a low tone

  talbot who by reason of his stature
and because of where he stood could
see better than any of the other prin-
cipal actors into the hall started in
surprise and stared

  the archbishop cleared his throat
and started to speak a movement at
the doorway and then a clear rich
mocking voice rang out


peoples

  come then prince we are among
good friends

  szolnak leaped from where he stood
and pushed aside the guests who had
made an involuntary movement to see
from whom the voice came when he
was beyond them and could see the
doorway he stopped with a muttered
oath

  prince szchymsl and a beautiful
woman stood there side by side he
knew without being told that the woman
was the countess elsa

  count szolnak said the prince

  are we in time for the ceremony
count demanded the countess then
closely followed by the prince who bore
himself fiercely while she was all radi-
ant smiles she swept forward through
the throng that parted to let her pass
and came into view of the wedding
party

  ah the prince cried

  im afraid we interrupt said the
countess her lips smiling but her eyes
flaming do we interrupt count szol-
nak she demanded turning to him

  he bowed low it has just begun
he said in a low voice

  the princess sonia turned her head
indifferently the duke had been star-
ing at the newcomers the prince he
knew too well to look at twice the
woman he did not know but he guessed
who she was as readily as szolnak had
done so it was no surprise to him when
the princess cried out

  countess elsa

  the archbishop changed color and
stepped back tt was amazing how the
personality of the countess dominated
them all

  what a charming couple they make
prince the countess said but dear
me princess sonia is this the way you
keep your word you were to take no
further part in the revolution which
reminds me where is our friend sir
chester 

  here countess he answered  here
awaiting your kindly help

  the countess looked in his direction
and such persons as had crowded be-
tween moved away it seemed that
every one knew of the mysterious
woman who had been the very soul of
the contemplated revolution

  the countess laughed with real mer-
riment what they actually have
overcome the invincible hero she
laughed again and then turned and
looked at the princess

  there was something so sinister in
this look that fear woke in the unhappy
girl and with a cry she ran to tal-
bots side

  if only i were free he panted

  she began to tug at his bonds but
her little hands were quite inadequate
to the task i can do nothing- she
moaned

  talbot raged but was helpless he
had strained at the cord until his wrists
were raw there was nothing to do
but await the issue

  countess said szolnak who had
been exchanging glances with some and
whispers with others of the nobles
with your permission we will go on
with the wedding as you know it is
the one wise thing for us to do the
whole country demands it

  and if i refuse this permission you
demand- she cried

  i should be sorry if you did since
your services to the country have been
so great but with or without your
permission the wedding must go on
monseigneur continue  princess i beg
you to return

  the countess flashed a glance at the
prince another at szolnak and then
rested her eyes on the princess who
was nestling close to talbot and who
only drew the closer to him at the words
of szolnak

  do you defy me then count szol-
nak she cried fiercely

  i do not defy you countess but i
talking talbot



must act in accordance with the welfare
of the country princess

  but swift to decide and to act the
countess caught the prince by the sleeve
and whispered keep by me  i will
spoil their game yet and in another
moment she had reached the side of the
officer who stood apart with his drawn
sword in his hand

  he had no notion of what was going
to happen and was staring wonderingly
at this beautiful woman who had come
to turn everything into a turmoil so
she had no difficulty in snatching his
sword out of his hand

  sonia saw her coming with her glit-
tering weapon and feared at once for
talbot she cried out and threw her-
self in front of him no no she
cried you shall not

  the countess laughed aloud it
really is so then she said sir
chester if i set you free and the little
princess too will you stand by me
talbot understood the instant the
words were spoken with all my
heart countess he answered and
lurned his back to her

  in a moment the cord was cut with
a grim laugh talbot turned we cant
fail countess he said

  we need only a few minutes she
said in a low tone do anything to
keep them occupied there will be a
regiment of hussars here in a few min-
utes take the sword

  i have my revolver he answered
he asked no questions because he
understood the whole plan now that
he was free he knew how to act he
saw that the nobles had been so taken
aback by the act of the countess that
they were unable to do anything they
simply stared at each other

  it was not a situation to be thrown
away with a leap he was by the side
of the duke his revolver at his head

  one movement he said threaten-
ingly and i will put a bullet in your

brain and he added ominously i
would like nothing better

  sonia was by his side immediately
the countess followed by the prince
was there almost as soon

  i think said the countess in her
mocking way addressing szolnak that
we are masters of the situation what
fools you are do you think this child
is fit to lead a revolution do you
want to lose your heads do you think
you can win because you marry these
two  where would you be without the
money i bring and the regiments the
prince contributes

  it is the logical thing to do count-
ess answered szolnak recovering
from his stupefaction at finding the
tables so suddenly turned

  the duke sullenly said something in
hungarian the countess burst into a
good-tempered laugh and answered in
german sir chester do you know
what his highness says he tells me
that if he had first seen me he would
not have been so warm for the other
alliance are you not angry with such
poor judgment

  talbot smiled grimly i had sworn
to myself to kill him countess and i
would have done it

  i am sure you would sir ches-
ter she interrupted

  talbot went on but if he will
marry you i shall be satisfied

  the countess at that laughed more
merrily than before ah sir ches-
ter she said you and i would be
the ideal couple but much as i admire
you in the same degree i detest you
you are much too masterful for me
we would never get on together the
little princess is a much fitter mate for
you

 he may have her growled the
duke put down your pistol fellow
i ask nothing better than to make the
countess my wife what do you say
countess elsa shall it be a match


peoples

now that i have seen you i will have
no one else

  there was a sudden noise of many
hoofs trampling the lurf and the gravel
of the driveway

  put your revolver away sir ches-
ter the countess said yve are mas-
ters now there is our regiment-

  almost as she spoke there was an
irruption into the hall of several men
followed by screams from the women
in the salon and a crowding of the men
together

  have no fear friends cried the
countess in her full voice the prince
has merely brought a regiment of hus-
sars to show you a small part of his
contribution to the cause

  count maurus strode into tin salon
and looked for his sister when he
saw her standing by the side of talbot
and the princess with smiles on her
face he stopped where he was

  allies now maurus laughed the
countess in good humor what do
you say to a compromise count szol-
nak

  you are generous to offer a com-
promise when it is in your power to
dictate terms he answered with no
little dignity

  talbot looked down at the princess
who stood by him trembling with ap-
prehension she had not understood
as well as he had

  it will all come out right little
sonia he whispered it will be to
the interest of the countess to help us
you will see

  compromise or terms what does it
matter she cried in a voice to be
heard by all i suppose we all think
first of our country we all are agreed
that the duke of jankovacz shall be
our sovereign what need of terms or
compromise or controversy t think
and i say that such an alliance as the
one about to be made was a mistake
tf i know the mind of the princess-

and if i dont she is here to set me
right-she wishes nothing so little as
the throne

  nor would i ever occupy it cried
the princess lifting her head proudly
if this marriage had been forced on
me by the threat of the murder of the
man i love  would have killed my-
self

  why sir chester murmured the
countess you actually have made her
over from a coward into a brave
woman my congratulations  then
in a louder voice she took up the talk
again but it is not only the wishes
of the princess that are to be consid-
ered in her heart she is more slav
than magyar and already that has af-
fected the feelings of those whose aid
we most want if you do not believe
me ask that regiment of hussars who
have come here to honor their future
king

  the applause at this was unmistaka-
ble indeed it was plain that the
countess had completely captured the
fancy of the high-spirited hungarians

  count szolnak was quick to see that
it would be foolish to strive against one
who held the treasures the men and
the power of persuasion his blood
quickened at the thought of having such
a queen to serve for he saw that the
duke would soon be no more than a
figurehead

  countess he said let me be one
of the lirst to acknowledge the superi-
ority of your wisdom and judgment

  the high nobles and all the others in
the room hastened to make their peace
with the woman in whom they saw
their future queen and in a few mo-
ments they were crowding about her
and treating her as if already she occu-
pied the throne of the magyars

  the countess intoxicated by the easy
triumph turned smilingly to talbot
who had watched the progress of her
affairs doubtful and prepared for the
worst confess sir chester she
talking talbot



said this is worth making a struggle
for isnt it

  that depends entirely he answered
upon what it holds for me

  she laughed oh we are allies
now and i am as faithful to my friends
as i am bitter toward my enemies you
may safely put your revolver away
you will have no use for it

  and the princess he said

  is in no danger from me as long
as i am in no danger from her she
has nothing to fear from me what
a good friend you are i was unfortu-
nate in being unable to win your good
will

  you never tried you set out to
make a tool of me from the first

  i didnt know you as well then as
i do now sir chester i thought of
you as an exceptional gun fighter
thats all i knew of talking talbot
then  i know better now

  well he said it doesnt matter
now if you had come to me and told
me frankly what you wanted i might
have refused but it would have saved
you all that trouble and waste of time
in paris

  she laughed it wasnt wasted
you brought to my friends here all
the papers they needed you didnt
know it but you carried them nicely
hidden in your bag they were taken
out in your hotel in budapest as
long as you refused to bring me in with
you i let you bring my valuable papers
you are a hard adverasary to get
the better of he said

  you are a harder she retorted
you could have ruined all my plans
if you had wished i mean she added
if you had not fallen in love you
did didnt you  and she laughed

  yes answered talbot serenely i
fell headlong

  good  cried the countess i dont
need to ask the princess if the same
calamity happened to her i knew that
the first time vve met

chapter xv

  prince szchymsl approached the
countess and spoke to her in hungarian
she answered quickly and turned to
talbot

  we are going to have a conference
will you wait here until it is over

  have i really a choice in the mat-
ter he asked

  absolutely she answered i keep
my word in letter and spirit maurus
is in charge of the hussars and knows
what my wish is in regard to you the
prince has told him but if you will
wait i think you will not be sorry

  i will wait he said

  the countess followed by the duke
the prince and all the high nobles
went into the smaller room that had
been the scene of so much that was
vital in talbots life

  talbot and the princess were left
standing together by themselves while
the rest of the party remained in small
groups on the other side of the room

  for a few minutes talbot and the
princess maintained silence both of
them overcome by the sort of depres-
sion that so often follows periods of
exaltation and excitement

  talbot looked at her she had been
watching him studying his grave face
when he turned his eyes on her she
flushed and looked away

  she was very beautiful very pure
very winsome he recalled how sure
he had been that there never would be
any other woman in his life than the
one who had treated him so shabbily
and yet here was this girl whom he
had known so short a time and to whom
he had given his heart utterly

  of himself he felt sure but had he
any right to believe that she in her
inexperience could know whether she
loved hitn or only regarded him with
admiration respect and grateful liking

  sonia he said

yes sir chester she responded


peoples

looking up and then quickly down again
as if a bit frightened by what she saw
in his face

  you are a very true and honest lit-
tle girl

  yes sir chester she breathed in
alarm looking up again and studying
his face intently what is the mat-
ter

  will you be honest and true with

me now

  now and always

will you search your heart and try
to answer me with perfect frankness
you know i must sir chester
when i was bound and in danger
of- my life you said you loved me
yes

  and i told you that i loved you
yes she never took her eyes
from his while he spoke but the quick
movement of her bosom betrayed her
emotion fear and dismay were creep-
ing into her eyes

  you are safe now and i am safe
he said i know how i feel because
i am old enough to know because i
have had experience in emotion be-
cause i havemown many women but
you sonia are you sure can you
be sure can you even answer me
now or do you wish for time to think
it over

  i dont think i understand you sir
chester wrhy are you so stern  what
have i done dont you love me any
more was it a mistake her lip
trembled but she did not move her
eyes from his

  it was no mistake on my part
sonia he said quickly covering her
hand with his i am serious not
stem your answer means everything
to me i love you with all my heart
and soul

  a glad smile broke over her face
dimpling her cheeks adorably   am
so glad i was afraid what do you
wish to know if i love you oh
sir chester

  i want to know if you are sure
you have had so little experience i
want you to search your heart

  oil sir chester she said letting
her brown head rest for a moment 
his arm how can you ask me to
search my heart when you must know
there is nothing to find there but you
you my knight my wonderful man
if i could only show it to you sure
but you fill my life it is like asking
me if i am sure of the breath i breathe
or of the sunlight that brightens and
warms me it is i who should doubt
not you are you sure sir chester
why should you love me do you

  and you will give up all that your
position here means to go with me to
a strange land to enter on a new life
you will trust me so much as that
sonia

  i would rather wear rags and eat
crusts with you than have all the world
can offer without you oh i cant tell
you how much i love you but it is as
much as i can love at all

  and you will be my wife soon

  whenever you like it is for you
to say

  there were too many onlookers for
him to yield to his desire to take her
into his arms and hold her close to him
so lie pressed the little hand that lay
under his

  i will try to make you very happy
he said

  he led her to seat where they would
be partially screened by a large pillar
and there they sat and talked the wise-
foolish things that come so naturally to
those who really love

  there they were joined after a while
by the countess and szolnak the lat-
ter was discreetly pleased the former
was radiant and triumphant

  the wisest way with you sir ches-
ter the countess said is the most
direct way so i will take it the duke
and i are to be wedded here to-night
talking talbot



  i fancied something of that sort
would result well

  we all feel that the princess sonia
kotorska will be a menace to us
yes said talbot rising to his feet
the countess laughed how ready
for action i say the princess is and
must be a menace but mrs talbot will
not be now or ever

  talbot drew a long breath i un-
derstand

  i didnt think it would take many
words to make you understand the
countess laughed and you princess 
do you also understand

  sonia flushed rose and stood close
to talbot yes  also can understand
what you mean

  and you are ready

  i will do whatever sir chester bids
me

  yes murmured the countess now
and always and that is well for you
for talking talbot is the sort of man
who will have his own way but he is a
good man sonia and i think you are
as line and good as you are beautiful
 am sure sir chester has already told
you that she laughed well what
do you say sir chester will you take
advantage of the opportunity and re-
move the princess from my path by mar-
rying her now  there will be another
wedding at the same time i may tell
you

  do you mean that  have a choice
he asked

  i mean that it is the only way we
can be sure of removing the danger of
a free princess sonia

  then i have no choice he per-
sisted

  isnt it only a question of time she
asked are you not ready to make her
your wife why do you hesitate
because i dislike the priest and i
dislike the company he answered
bluntly i dont mean i dislike you
countess as a matter of fact i like

you and i am sorry you lose yourself
in your ambition

  she thinks of her country hungry
for her own national life interposed
szolnak as for the priest one is the
same as another for such a purpose
besides he too may be a patriot

  let it be as you wish talbot said
abruptly

  i shall not feel married talbot
said in a low tone to sonia when they
were left to themselves but at least
it will be legal and when we reach
switzerland we can be married again
why did she call you talking tal-
bot sonia asked irrelevantly

  it is a name they gave me in my
own country

  but you dont talk much

  there is a saying in english that
actions speak louder than words i
think the name has something to do
with that he answered smiling as he
thought of the effect on his western
friends of the coming into their midst
of his beautiful bride

  then you have always done things
she said moving her little head admir-
ingly but of course you have

  ive surely done something this
time he said gayly

  and i was thinking of killing my-
self hardly an hour ago she mur-
mured  wonder if i could have done
it do you think i could

  i am sure of it he replied with
conviction and the duke would have
followed you very soon

  and you too

  i expected it i hoped it

  once more the archbishop stood up
to perform the ceremony of marriage
but this time there were two couples
and both couples were eager and will-
ing

  an hour later talbot and his bride
once more in their own garments were
seated on the back of the princes au-
tomobile which had been put in work-
ing order and brought to the dukes


peoples

castle they had passports vised and
every necessary paper to speed them on
their way

  before they started count maurus
came up to the car and put out his
hand to talbot will you shake hands
now mr talbot he said i am
sorry you ever came to any harm
through your connection with me and
 want you to believe that i never in-
tended such a result

  i never doubted it count a man
as brave as you is never the sort to do
dirty work i hope you are going to
win out here

  some day yes but this revolution
will never come to anything  am sure
of it and that is another reason why
t am here dont lose any time on the
way to switzerland get over the bor-
der as quickly as possible

  you think there will be a counter-
blow

  i do the countess thinks it will
come to nothing and has risked every-
thing on this marriage with that un-
speakable duke  would prefer a con-
stitutional monarchy or better yet a
republic and one or the other is in-
evitable eventually just now the dual
monarchy is on the verge of ruin but
as is often the case has yet the power
to crush a premature effort

  thank you count for your frank-
ness ill lose no time on the way i
was going back for my luggage in the
village but now i wont

  unless there is something of value
there better let it go good-by you
may yet see me at your ranch looking
for the job you once offered me
talbot laughed it will be open to
you always

  good-by princess

  im not a princess any more she
said i am plain-how do you say it
sir chester

  mrs talbot was the laughing re-
sponse

  missis talbot she repeated it

sounds like snakes never mind if it
is english it will sound good to me
good-by count maurus

  oh by the way count said talbot
were those two enterprising gentle-
men found in my room in paris
count maurus laughed heartily
they were two furious men and they
always speak of you as that devil of
an american

  i dont see yet the necessity for all
that melodrama in paris said talbot
why was it

  elsa had determined to use yrou
that is all once she fixes her mind on
anything she is immovable but you
should be satisfied you have beaten her
from first to last

  and going home with my booty
laughed talbot squeezing the hand of
his bride well good-by and the best
of luck

  keep the place open for me count
maurus called after them as the car
rolled off

  they reached the frontier in tmie to
greet donald brookfield when he ar-
rived with the other prisoners already
don was able to walk with some brisk-
ness his few days of freedom taken
with the radical change of scene and air
had done wonders for him

  he grasped talbots hand and wrung
it enthusiastically i can never thank
you he said simply

  you dont need to i owe your
mother more than you could possibly
owe me come meet my wife

  i didnt know your wife was with
you cried don in surprise  how
did you dare bring her over here

   didnt

  you mean she was over here al-
ready 

  yes

  oh  then you came on her account
too 

  no i didnt know she was here
laughed talbot oh come meet her
talking talbot



sonia lie said to her come meet
my friend donald brookfield she
speaks french and german besides
some other languages he said to don
but  english

  donald positively stared at her in his
profound admiration i-i didnt
even know you were married he said

  i wasnt when i saw you laughed
talbot and only half married now
according to my way of thinking
though sonia is satisfied 

  i should think so indeed she cried
with an archbishop to perform the
ceremony

  anyhow said talbot were going
to have it done over again in geneva
and i hope youll be a witness

  what does it all mean  demanded
don i can see there is some mystery
i broke into a revolutionary plot and
carried off the head of it thats all
answered talbot fll tell you about it
on the way to geneva

  you shall not sir chester i will
tell you monsieur donald he would
have it over in ten words i shall take
two hours

  believe me i prefer to listen to
vou said don but why sir ches-
ter

  he was my true knight and since
i was almost a queen i gave him the
accolade

  talbot blushed twenty times during
the recital and tried to stop sonia but
donald listening eagerly begged him
to shut up and her to go on with her
story when it was told he remained
silent for some time then demanded
have you any sisters princess
im not a princess any more please
no i have no sisters why

  at least you have some girl cous-
ins

  no but why 

  if you had i was going back at
once but i might have known you were
the only one of the family you are
certainly lucky talbot

    

  it is i who am lucky sonia pro-
tested with a deep blush

  very much to her amusement she
and talbot were married again in ge-
neva as he had said they should be

  hes quite right don declared
if you were my wife id have three
weddings but id tie the knot fast

  mrs brookfield met the steamer in
the tug and was taken down to dons
stateroom by talbot later she met
sonia and took her to her heart in a
way to make sonia very happy

  my dear she said to the bride you
have the best man in the world for a
husband

  i am sure of that acquiesced
sonia

  to talbot she said chester she
will take new york by storm such
beauty and such a manner will be a
revelation

not to new york said he grimly
youll never take her out into that
wild country and bury her  a ranch
new york is wilder than that coun-
try dear lady and she isnt a prin-
cess any more are you sonia

  i am missis talbot she replied
smiling at her own pronunciation and
i am crazy to go to the ranch

  besides laughed talbot im ex-
pecting a genuine count to join me as
one of my hands

  he had received word in paris of the
failure of the revolution and the nar-
row escape into serbia of the duke and
his new duchess maurus had sent word
that he would soon be with talbot in
t exas

  as was to be expected sonia took
talbots part of texas by storm when
he startled everybody by bringing a
bride back with him

  nobody wondered that he had been
routed out of his obstinate celibacy by
such a wonderful creature and every-
body is eager to help her in her studies
of the texas language

walter who makes an enemy of her by not respond-

fraud quarrels with the captain and is left for dead
on the barren beach of one of the tiny islands near

turkish delight

in those days of zohrabs infatuation
for maisie sellon hussein ali
never left him alone for a moment
if it could be helped the hypnotic in-
fluence which was undoubtedly the
secret of his power though to some ex-
tent continuous in its action was weak-
ened by lack of contact between practi-
tioner and subject

  so it was that joanna wishing to see
hussein alone frittered away a whole
morning in vain attempts and in the
end so important was her business had
to seek him in her brothers presence
followed by a stalwart native carrying
a bloodstained sword she entered the
billiard room where she knew that the
two were together hussein was loung-
ing on a settee while zohrab was list-
lessly practicing cannons on the table

  husseins snaky eyes taking in the
the plunder ship



young womans eager entrance and the
reddened blade of her companion con-
tracted in a sudden frown he half
rose and opened his lips to speak but
was too late to gain the first word

  the englishman lynden is dead
exclaimed joanna in the native tongue
abdoolah has slain him after a long
chase through the jungle speak ab-
doolah and tell them how fleet of foot
you were in pursuit of the enemy of
jogore

  the mans story came pat enough
he was one of those who had been
searching for the englishman since his
escape from the palace and he had come
suddenly upon him in a rice field at the
east of the island not far from a steep
precipice overhanging the lagoon the
quarry had started running but he ab-
doolah had overtaken him on the brink
of the precipice and had cloven him to
the neck so that the body fell into the
water

  after his first sign of displeasure
hussein had listened calmly to the mans
-statement and zohrab showed traces of
growing anger and clenched his cue
as though to strike the self-confessed
slayer of the englishman lest hussein
should extract the information from
him his sister had said nothing to him
of walters whereabouts but he had
been hoping during the past two days
that his english rival had made good
his escape the worst he wished wal-
ter was that he would go away and
leave the coast clear for him to win
maisie sellon for the barbaric strain
in his nature made small allowance for
womans constancy

  husseins prompt grip of the situa-
tion relieved the tension

  your highness did not witness this
occurrence he said to joanna raising
a restraining finger at zohrab

  not perceiving his drift joanna saw
no need for another lie she shook her
black locks and stamped her cane impa-
tiently

  you could not have done so hus-
sein went on in his smoothest manner
and for this reason abdoolahs story
is not true  know where the english-
man lynden is at this moment and no
harm will befall him under certain
happy circumstances which we all desire
to bring about i have too much need
of mr lynden just at present to com-
pass his death

  this was startling news for joanna
and she scanned husseins face for in-
dications that he was aware of the part
that she had played in befriending wal-
ter but the sphinxlike features re-
mained inscrutable only smiling cruelly
at the now frightened swordsman zoh-
rab heaved a sigh of mingled relief and
perplexity

  as for you abdoolah proceeded
hussein a prison is the best place for
one who tries to gain praise for a deed
that he has not committed it will rest
with his highness whether to extend to
you mercy or punishment when in due
course you are brought up for judg-
ment

  he clapped his hands and three of
the armed men who were always within
hail of zohrab rushed in the delin-
quent was led away without protest
but casting appealing glances at his in-
stigator joanna however averted her
eyes too much was at stake for her
to avow her share in the deception by-
pleading for the unfortunate at any
rate till he was in peril of torture or
death

  the incident convinced her that with
hussein professing knowledge of wal-
ters whereabouts it would be wasted
labor to devise schemes for taking mai-
sie to him on the atoll yet her wom-
ans heart made her shudder at the only
alternative of preventing the forced
marriage-that of falling back  her
knowledge of drugs

  as a matter of fact she might have
spared herself both the design and the
justification if she could have taken a


peoples

peep into the obscurities of husseins
mind that astute diplomatist having
no reason to the contrary quite be-
lieved abdoolahs story of walters
death and was not at all displeased
with it his pretended disbelief was
not due to any knowledge such as he
had professed but to a certain scheme
to which walter lynden still supposed
to be in the flesh was essential

   he had been on the point of putting
this scheme in train when joanna had
entered and he was now doubly anx-
ious to do so the ladies in the garden
were well watched and guarded but ru-
mor flies by magic in the east and it
was essential to his purpose to fore-
stall the episode of the bloodstained
sword

   i am going to visit our fair guests
he said significantly is it the pleas-
ure of your highness to accompany
me

   zohrab had gone back to his occupa-
tion of knocking the billiard balls about
he seemed dull and apathetic and all
the rather childish brightness which
walter had noticed as mingling with his
discontent had vanished at husseins
invitation he first looked up eagerly
and made as though to lay down his
cue but immediately resumed it

  whats the use he replied sul-
lenly miss sellon is as cold as ice
to me for the last three days i have
heen making love to her yet she does
nothing but laugh i begin to wonder
whether i speak english with a native
accent or what is it that makes her
laugh god knows i have got money
enough to tempt most women

  hussein had continued to humor him
by talking english to him when they
were alone during the last few days

  my dear master he said in an
affectionately deferential tone that
scarcely veiled the irony of the appella-
tion you take the thing altogether too
seriously you forget you are an in-
dependent sovereign of vast wealth and

within your own realm of unlimited
power the girl is really at your mercy
why let me ask you for the twentieth
time should you behave like a rejected
suitor there is no need for consent
for a moment hussein thought that
his words had struck home zohrab
quietly finished his stroke without re-
plying and made a clever shot off the
red into a side pocket then his fine
half-semitic features blazed into a sud-
den tumult of fury as he flung aside his
cue

  dont you forget you black beast
that i am a white man he thundered
you control me god knows how in
most things but i am too strong for
you in this miss sellon may laugh and
laugh but though i am on fire for her
i will not lay a finger on her till she
gives me leave

   hussein listened not only without re-
sentment but with every appearance of
deep respect

  i go he said meekly raising his
bowed head to secure that permission
your highness has reminded me some-
what forcibly of the difference in the
shades of our complexions-the sar-
casm was quite lost upon its subject-
but our hearts are of the same color
i may be allowed to presume

   the smoldering lire of his coal-black
orbs burned deep into zohrabs soul and
partially regained the mastery

  you are faithful i know and i
spoke in haste replied zohrab weak-
ening fulfill your promise and pro-
cure for me mies sellons consent i
care not how and there is nothing i
will not give you for the asking

  the golden gates said hussein
with the sly insinuation of half jest that
may however be taken for sober ear-
nest at the will of the listener

   aye even the golden gates replied
zohrab but for voluntary consent
only mind you and look here hus-
sein he added as the other prepared
to depart well satisfied you might tell
the plunder ship



me what has become of lynden i am
doing the poor chap a fearful injury in
robbing him of miss sellon and i
should like to make him some compen-
sation you changed your mind and
allowed him to leave the island un-
harmed 

  again hussein brought the hidden
force of his wonderful eyes into play
and beat the will of the other into sub-
jection

   there i must ask you to excuse me
in your highness own interests he re-
plied firmly when i have gained for
you your hearts desire and then alone
will it be well for you to hear the steps
i took to clear mr lynden from your
path the knowledge now might only
hamper your courtship but i have no
fear but that you will approve in the
end

   so saying he left zohrab no chance
of protest by quitting the room mak-
ing his way to the wing where the sel-
lons were lodged he beckoned one of
the men in attendance in the hall

   i want to see the old englishwoman
alone if she is with her daughter call
her out he said

   but the man answered with a grin
that there was no need the ladies had
quarreled he believed at any rate
they spent nearly all their time apart
the elder one in the sitting room and the
younger one in the private garden of
the wing where she now was

   hussein thereupon entered the room
and was welcomed almost affectionately
by mrs sellon who was surrounded
with evidences of the profuse hospi-
tality lavished upon her and her daugh-
ter a basket of mangoes stood on the
small table at her elbow  a liqueur stand
and an ice pail graced the cairene stool
at her side

   really this is too good of your ex-
cellency-to drop in for a friendly
chat she began i am afraid that
i have no good news for you though
she went on when her visitor with

many salaams had seated himself
maisie was always an obstinate girl
and though i am sure she does not dis-
like his highness she wont listen to
me when i speak of the proposed
honor

  the signs of enormous wealth the
titles and mock air of court etiquette
observed at jogore had done their work
so far as mrs sellon was concerned
profoundly ignorant on all matters out-
side her own selfish interests she was
under the impression that zohrab was
the recognized prince of an independent
and powerful state and that hussein
as his vizier would certainly attend the
prince of wales levees when in lon-
don the dazzling prospect of an alli-
ance with so much power and splendor
had led captive her greedy sold and she
looked forward to queening it as the
mother of her highness the sultana
of jogore she little thought that the
blandly smiling asiatic opposite had
doomed her to a lifelong residence  a
coral island

  a little sentiment about mr lyn-
den still blocks the way to our hopes
eh said hussein it seems a pity
that an attachment of that kind should
mar your daughters career and he
appeared to lose himself in thought the
picture of an oriental statesman trying
to solve a knotty point

  to think that that wretched young
man should have turned up here said
mrs sellon querulously if they
hadnt met here again the other day
maisie would probably have forgotten
all about him

  annoying certainly dear madam
but by no means an unmixed evil
said hussein in his silkiest manner
in fact i was just reflecting that mr
lynden might be used to solve our
little difficulty by enabling us to put a
gentle pressure on our pretty miss sel-
lon all is fair in love and war says
your english proverb though i should
not dream of advising this course tin-


peoples

less  felt sure that it would have your
maternal approval

  but how are you going to lose lyn-
den you sent him off to bombay in
the sultans steam yacht i thought
queried mrs sellon in surprise

  a polite fiction madam conceived in
the kindness of his highness heart to
save your daughter anxiety on her ex-
lovers behalf said hussein with a
cunning wink the fact is however
that mr lynden had infringed the laws
of this state in such a heinous manner
that i as his highness chief adviser
was compelled to have him detained
he is at this moment in the public
prison of jogore and the punishment
allotted to his crime under our code is
-death

  hussein looked at her meaningly and
mrs sellon regarded him with an ox-
like stare into which presently came an
answering gleam but she was a stupid
woman and had mistaken his meaning

  you think that after he has been
executed maisie will give in and prefer
a living man with a lot of money to a
dead pauper she said with a callous
laugh a good idea but your excel-
lency doesnt know my daughter if that

is your plan she would-

  pardon me interposed hussein
gently quick to see that he need not
scruple to make his proposal to a
woman of such stony heart  always
lean to mercy if practicable and that
was not my notion at all t think that
if we made miss sellons consent the
price of mr waller lyndens life it
would be a better move eh

  splendid cried mrs sellon clap-
ping her pudgy hands in ecstasy shall
i go and strike while the iron is hot
she is in the garden

  it will come better from you
madam i will await you here replied
hussein rising to hold the french win-
dow for her

  mrs sellon sailed across the garden
and soon espied maisie at the wicket

gate leading into the larger grounds
where she had had her brief interview
with walter mrs sellon caught a
glimpse of some one at the other side
of the gate who vanished at her appear-
ance

  maisie turned to her mother with a
stiff little laugh the relations between
the two had been strained for the last
day or two

  see she cried holding up a lump
of turkish delight and plainly glad
of a noncontentious subject of conver-
sation i have made a new friend
that nice girl who received us after the
wreck has just presented me with this
you frightened her away as she was
beginning to explain the gift

chapter xix

a bargain tor a life

  mrs sellon sniffed contemptuously
at the sweetmeat which maisie held up
for her inspection in her hazy concep-
tion of the establishment in which she
was being entertained she had regarded
the portuguese woman who had re-
ceived them on arrival as a sort of
housekeeper and had almost dismissed
her from memory

  if she had known that joanna was
the sister of the eastern prince for
whom she was angling as a son-in-law
also that she was within earshot behind
the prickly-pear hedge she would have
been more discreet as it was she re-
peated the insulting epithet which had
first won joannas enmity with a worse
one on the top of it

  the figure of fun  she cried the
young minx is currying favor with her
future mistress i suppose seeing which
way the wind blows i have got some-
thing more important to talk about than
her though come maisie you are
going to be a sensible girl and accept the
brilliant prospect offered you 

  i dont wish to be disrespectful
mother but if you have only come out
the plunder ship



to repeat that absurdity you had better
have stayed in the cool room maisie
replied why she went on warmly
leaving me out of the question how
can you ever expect to look my dear
father in the face after countenancing
such a ridiculous proposal

  your father thinks that we both
went down in the tiber he ought to be
glad to find that you are alive and mar-
ried to a prince replied mrs sellon
that is not the point however a
good deal more depends on your deci-
sion than colonel sellons displeasure-
no less than a mans life i should not
care to stand in your shoes if you per-
sist in your obstinacy

  oh i dont think you need be afraid
that poor zohrab will die of love
laughed maisie merrily

  mrs sellon eyed her daughter mali-
ciously spitefully conscious that she had
it in her power to turn that laughter
into tears

  i was not speaking of his highness
the sultan she said after a full enjoy-
ment of the pleasures of anticipation
my allusion was to your pursuing ad-
mirer mr walter lynden it is his
life which will be imperiled by your re-
fusal

  maisie experienced in her mothers
extravagances did not at first take her
seriously

  that cannot be even supposing your
friend zohrab and hussein ali to be the
heads of a gang of murderers she
said mr lynden was to sail for
bombay five days ago he is safe there
by this time

  thats just where he isnt shrilled
mrs sellon triumphantly he broke
the laws of this place-some disgrace-
ful conduct i have no doubt-and was
not allowed to leave he is still on the
island and has been sentenced to death
maisie scenting the truth or at least
belief in the excited ring of her moth-
ers tone went as pale as a sheet

  but-but if this is true how does
it affect my decision  she faltered

  simply because if you accept the
sultans offer lyndens life will be
spared if you refuse he will be
hanged said mrs sellon cruelly

  and you would wish to see me the
wife of a savage who would force me
under such a condition as that-you
my mother cried the girl as the bitter 
tears came into her eyes that is al-
most as hard as the sacrifice you are
asking me to make

  ah but it isnt zohrabs doing
blurted mrs sellon eagerly gathering
hope from her daughters words lie
doesnt even know of it hussein ali
manages everything here and it was he
with his sovereigns happiness at heart
who thought of this way of bringing
you to reason he commissioned me
to put this matter before you and he
is waiting for your answer now
maisie caught in the toils looked
helplessly round her but there was no
one in sight to whom she could appeal
or for the matter of that in the whole
island unless she thought with quick
intuition zohrab himself would have
pity on her

  then i shall throw myself on zoh-
rabs mercy she replied after a pause
he at least shall know what is being
done in his name go and take that an-
swer to hussein-that if zohrab will
himself come and impose these condi-
tions on me i will at least listen to him
if only to insure that the wicked plot
has his sanction from the sheepish
way in which the poor creature made
love to me i do not believe him to be
so bad as that

  but- mrs sellon began to pro-
test

  that is quite final the girl inter-
rupted  must have this from zohrab
in person or i shall regard the whole
affair as a hoax in which you will have
been a not very enviable dupe-mother
the last word was uttered with evi-


peoples

dent reluctance and maisie pointed her
decision by turning her back mrs sel-
lon cast an evil look at her hesitated
and then making her way back to the
house with extreme dignity disap-
peared through the french window

  maisie remained on the scene of the
interview within a yard or two of the
prickly-pear hedge and close to the
wicket gate in her agitation she had
plucked a tuberose blossom and was un-
consciously tearing off its petals one by
one the condition of her mind at
present varied between intense irrita-
tion and rather more than a shade of
uneasiness the former was due to the
belief relapsing now into a confident
hope that she was the victim of an im-
possible situation created by her moth-
ers infatuated folly the latter to a
growing impression that the ways of
jogore were not to be judged by ordi-
nary standards it was beginning to
dawn upon her as a little singular that
an island ruled by a sultan from a
palace and boasting steam yachts
european luxuries and an armed sol-
diery had not had its name familiarized
to her either at school or during her
residence in india

  not for long was she allowed to pur-
sue her reverie a quavering but not
unmusical voice broke the silence and
looking up she saw the young woman
who had given her the sweetmeat and
who had vanished at the sight of mrs
sellon at the gate the sight reminded
her of the gift and so did joannas
tremulous question

  you havent eaten that raiai iak-
liumn that i gave you

  not yet said maisie nodding and
smiling at the apparition and holding
up the lump of sweetmeat which she had
retained in her hand

  well dont then-yet said joanna
it is poisoned one little nibble and
you will be in purgatory if that fat
old woman had not come out i should
have warned you but t joanna of goa

could not stay to be called a figure of
fun to my face

  you did not mean to poison me
then said maisie drawn to and yet
repelled by the quaint figure in euro-
pean dress but with asiatic figure and
complexion mouthing at her through
the bars of the gate she was filled
with shame that her mothers insults
should have been overheard and under-
stood by this pretty creature whose atti-
tude was not unfriendly

  i wished you to have the means of
poisoning yourself was the startling
reply you have spoken good words
of myself and my brother zohrab and
i would not harm you willingly but
to such as you the fate which that fat
woman and hussein propose would be
worse than death so it is right that
you should possess the wherewithal to
choose the latter

  you then are zohrabs sister
said maisie faintly for joannas words
seemed to confirm mrs sellons state-
ment as to walters peril and her own

  yes i am the sister of syed bin
zohrab replied the girl with mingled
pride and sadness you did right just
now to insist on hearing that base con-
dition offered by his own lips lie
is not bad at heart and has already
withstood husseins temptation to take
you to himself by force if you see
zohrab alone you may be able to per-
suade him to spare mr lynden and
yourself but if as is most likely hus-
sein is present-well you may want
that lump of sweet stuff

  is it true that mr lynden is still
on the island and his life is threatened
asked maisie quietly fortified with
the means of escape that joanna had
given her she was able to give her
mind wholly to scheming for walters
safety in the heyday of her bright
young life she had  wish to die but
as compared with the other peril hang-
ing over her death had no terrors

  he has not gone away and hussein
the plunder ship



most surely intends to kill him joanna
began but before she could describe
walters position on the atoll and the
attempt which she had planned but
now dared not make to take maisie
to him there mrs sellon appeared at
the french window at sight of her
bete noire joanna vanished from the
wicket gate and maisie was therefore
unable to compare her story with the
false statement which she was shortly
to hear that walter was actually in con-
finement awaiting execution

  mrs sellon came some way toward
her beckoning and then called out
his highness is here he hastened
over the moment your message was
given him

  anxious to be done with suspense
maisie followed her mother quickly to
the house concealing as she went the
lump of sweetmeat in the pocket of her
dress as she drew near her knees
trembled with the frantic hope that zoh-
rab had come alone but directly she
crossed the threshold and saw the hate-
fully smiling face of hussein she braced
herself with the courage of despair it
was a picture of a brave self-possessed
young englishwoman that was framed
for an instant in the window and then
stepped quietly into the room

  zohrab deep in conversation with
hussein looked up eagerly at the girls
entrance and advanced with out-
stretched hand maisie ignored it and
ignored also the chair which hussein
placed for her taking another one the
effect being that when zohrab fell back
abashed and sat down he occupied the
relative position to hussein which the
latter had desired though maisie did
not from where she was seated she
had a greater opportunity of watching
the play of husseins face and the mo-
tion of his ever-restless hands

   maisie after noticing with relief that
her mother had passed through the room
and disappeared approached the sub-
ject abruptly

  is this true what i am told about
mr lynden she asked fixing zohrab
with her clear penetrating gaze

  under it the sultan of jogore cut a
piteous figure he essayed to speak
but though his lips moved spasmodi-
cally no sound came till hussein made
what looked like an impatient gesture

  quite true he managed to falter
out at last

  i will trouble you not to prompt
sir said maisie sharply to hussein
well go on she proceeded turning
again to zohrab i must have your
proposal and the conditions you wish
to make in your own- words from your
own mouth or i wont believe you ca-
pable of them

  it may have been that at that mo-
ment the frail girls undaunted spirit
came within an ace of casting out the
devil that possessed the great stalwart
simple-hearted eurasian he shook as
with an ague and trying to speak again
failed it may have been also that
hussein felt his vicarious kingdom slip-
ping from him for with more display
of control than he usually showed be-
fore others he laid his hand on zoh-
rabs knee and shook him with a gentle
swaying motion but he said never a
word

  slowly very slowly and with every
sign of shrinking reluctance zohrab
turned his frightened eyes on husseins
face and then the end was assured
held spellbound by the snaky glitter
that had fastened on him zohrab jerked
his head round toward maisie and be-
gan to speak automatically like a ven-
triloquists puppet

  mr lynden has broken the laws of
the state he began he is under
the sentence of death he is to be
hanged at daybreak to-morrow i will
spare him and send him away if you
will consent to marry me

  the jabbering intonation ceased and
the speaker sank hack in his seat so
utterly exhausted with the effort that


peoples

maisie knew afterward that it was at
this moment that the idea of hypnotic
suggestion first occurred to her in con-
nection with the thrall in which hus-
sein held zohrab for the present how-
ever she was too full of wrathful con-
tempt for any such lenient diagnosis

  laws of the state sentence of
death she broke out indignantly
how dare you talk like that about
an english sailor  know enough of
the map of asia to be very sure that
there is no state as you call it within
three days of the indian coast that
would live a week after committing
such an outrage 

  zohrab had subsided now that his
task was done and seemed incapable of
further effort it was hussein who
glibly took up the talking

  your argument refutes itself by its
own truth he said it is to the very
fact of its being an unknown land that
jogore owes its power and independ-
ence and it is to having endangered
its privacy by endeavoring to leave in
an unauthorized manner that mr lyn-
den owes his present position we are
compelled to make an example of him
-if only as a warning to others added
hussein with a latent gleam of ferocity
intended to overawe his fair opponent

  if so it quite failed of its mark she
was quite prepared to sacrifice her life
for her lovers safety but she did not
want to sacrifice it in vain and all her
wits were up in arms

  if i were to comply with these out-
rageous terms what guarantee should
i have that such as you would keep
your promise to let mr lynden go un-
harmed  she said shrewdly on re-
turning to england or reaching india
he would hardly remain silent  what
has happened

  hussein believing walter to be dead
was equal to the occasion we are
not afraid of that he laughed it
will be pointed out to mr lynden that
he would do you as the consort of his

highness a grave injury by giving in-
formation about jogore

  to maisie confident in her lovers
unselfish devotion the explanation was
quite plausible and she the more read-
ily accepted it as it pointed to her being
speedily avenged since she meant to
swallow the poisoned sweetmeat within
two minutes of the ceremony that would
fulfill her part of the bargain walter
would not long have cause for the si-
lence upon which hussein appeared to
reckon

  there was a long pause during which
liussein watched her as a cat does a
mouse and zohrab stole shamefaced
glances at her looking out across the
gray flowers through the window she
heeded neither of them but stood wrapt
in thought when at last she turned
and faced them all the girlish freshness
seemed to have gone from her face and
voice and  wonder for she turned to
pronounce her own doom

  to save the life of a fellow country-
man t must yield to this outrage-as it
is my mothers wish she said slowly
adding the second reason lest hussein
should suspect her purpose from too
ready compliance but she went on
there are two minor conditions on
which i must insist i dont know
whether you profess any religion in
this island but the ceremony must be
performed by a christian minister or
i withdraw my consent and before it
takes place i must with my own eyes see
mr lynden depart from jogore a free
man	v

  the conditions might have staggered
a less cunning player than hussein see-
ing that he believed walters body to
be lying at the bottom of the lagoon
and that there was no one even capable
of acting the part of a christian min-
ister at jogore yet he was not the
man to refuse a good offer and trust-
ing to his wits to extricate him from
the difficulty he promptly closed with it

  his highness is of the mohammedan
the plunder ship



faith he said grandiloquently but
 will at once dispatch the steam yacht
to bombay for a priest of your religion
and your other request-to witness mr
lyndens departure-shall most cer-
tainly be complied with

  so saying he gently shook zohrab
who looking more like a sleepwalker
than a victorious suitor rose and fol-
lowed him from the room at the door
hussein faced about and bowed pro-
foundly but zohrab passed out without
so much as a glance at his future bride

  when they were quite gone maisies
overwrought nerves gave way and
throwing herself on a couch she burst
into a flood of tears

chapter xx

  an alliance with the enemy

  so it was that walter lynden from
his precarious refuge on the atoll saw
the tulwar speeding northward her na-
tive commander being under orders to
pick up any drunken sot of a european
wastrel-a broken-down missionary for
choice-whom he could find in the ba-
zaar of bombay and bring him with
all speed to jogore

  that was on the morning of the fifth
day from joannas visit to the outlying
reef so that if she did not bring maisie
out to him during the ensuing night he
would know that her attempt at rescue
had failed and that the dread alterna-
tive which she had shouted to him
from the boat would take its place
and after the lapse of another twenty-
four hours powlett ferrars in the sea
hawk might reappear at any minute
to complicate-or save-the situation

  though walter was of course igno-
rant of the tulwars mission he acted
by a happy instinct just as if he had
known it dismissing a wildly con-
ceived hope that hussein had relented
and had sent maisie and her mother to
bombay in the yacht he decided to
prepare for the worst and take it for

granted that the ladies were still pris-
oners on the island with no chance of
success for joannas plan of escape for
maisie

  the tulwar had not been hull down
live minutes when his mind was made
up as to what course he would pursue
he had not been altogether idle during
the last few days having spent much
time in trying to learn the system of
the submarine mines in the entrance
channel through the reef which he had
discovered he had mastered the posi-
tion of most of the explosive cases
tracing them by the electric wires lead-
ing thereto but he had not completed
the work to his satisfaction he walked
round the reef as far as the channel
now and devoted the best part of the
day to finishing his investigation with
the result that before sunset he was
acquainted with every one of the con-
nections and was in a position to switch
them on or off at will

  by nightfall he was back again at the
spot where the steam siren stood silent
in the absence of its guardian angel
bob kent at least he hoped that the
old seaman would come off to the atoll
to give a ghost dance when even if
he did not bring maisie he might have
news of her but the hours passed
the brief twilight faded and no sound
of oars or grating keel came to cheer
the lonely watcher as -a matter of
fact joanna in her cross-purpose game
with hussein ignorant whether he
really knew walters whereabouts had
persuaded the old man to sham sick
and thus avoid drawing suspicion to the
atoll by a visit

  with the first flush of dawn walter
gave up-hope and flung himself down
for a few hours much-needed rest be-
fore facing the ordeal he had set him-
self it was a desperate remedy at
best for a desperate situation and he
had very little hope of coming out of
it alive himself but it would be better
than doing nothing now that the time


peoples

was up for joannas threatened poison
to take the place of rescue

  when lie rose but slightly refreshed
it was the open sea to the northward
that claimed his attention rather than
the lagoon and the distant island of
jogore according to his reckoning
the sea hawk might put in an appear-
ance any moment now and all day long
he lay in what shade he could find
straining his eyes to the quivering hori-
zon for the first trace of her smoke

  toward evening he was rewarded by
the sight of a faint blue cloud amid
which half an hour later the two pole
masts of the sea hazvk took shape
enough to gain his recognition

  the steamer appeared to be heading
for a point on the atoll some two miles
from the hidden channel and walter
at once set out thither allowing for
full speed it would be an hour and a
half before she arrived close inshore
by which time it would be too dark for
him to be seen from her and he would
be free to choose his own method of
making his presence known his great
fear was that he would be shot down
before he had done his business with
powlett ferrars

  one thing in favor of his plan he
had already noted with satisfaction
the place for which the sea hazvk was
making was the most densely wooded
in the whole of the encircling reef

  there was yet the chance that she
might change her course but if she
kept on as she was going there would
be no fear of her being seen from
jogore or any of the small craft fishing
in the lagoon she could approach and
lie to under a complete screen of tall
cocoa palms

  another point he had for self-con-
gratulation the coral growths form-
ing the atolls of the maldives rise sheer
from the depths of the ocean so that
up to the very beach the water is hun-
dreds of fathoms deep there being
no anchorage near or far the vessel

could come within hail as she had done
six days ago on her first appearance

  when he arrived at the palm grove
it was as dark as it ever is in those
latitudes when the brilliant stars are
unclouded but the green and red lights
of the oncoming steamer both visible
told him that he was right ahead of
her nearer and nearer she drew till
it was beyond doubt that ferrars meant
to land where he stood waiting the
only question was whether he would
land a party to commence his man
hunt that night or wait till the morn-
ing walter smiled grimly as he fer-
vently prayed that the former would
be the case

  i wonder if a man was ever so keen
before to meet a shipload of cutthroats
looking for him he thought as he
watched those steady red and green
eyes shining at him from the sea they
never wavered the course steered
was straight for the sheltering palms
and then like music on his ears there
sounded the thud of the screw and a
little later the hoarse cries of com-
mand as the steamer rounded to within
biscuit throw of the shore

 whatever happened now being
within easy ear shot he could com-
municate with the ship at will but he
waited a little to see if a boat would
put off none came on the contrary
the signs of activity on deck decreased
and he could see indistinct forms tum-
bling into the focsle he knew that
the steamer had been made snug for
the night and that all but the deck
watch were going to their bunks

  well here goes he said to him-
self i should have liked to know
if lena was on board but with that
terrible threat hanging over my dear
one i cant afford to lose the hours of
darkness and putting his hands to
his mouth he sent a mighty hail ringing
across the water

  sea haztk ahoy

  the sound of his voice was followed
the plunder ship



by half a minutes dead silence all
noises ceasing instantly on the vessel
at the unexpected hail then he saw
a mans figure run hurriedly up the
bridge stairs to join another already
there and then came an answering hail
in laban booths oily tones

  you there on shore ts that mr
lynden

 aye walter replied send a
boat will you  i have important in-
formation for the captain

  that will stop their cutting me down
or shooting me on sight he thought
as he noted that after a brief confer-
ence his request was being complied
with five minutes later he was climb-
ing the side of the sea hawk to be met
to his surprise by the outstretched hand
of powlett ferrars and the blandly
smiling countenance of laban booth
he had expected open enmity but he
mistrusted this cordial greeting more

  why lynden this is a pleasant sur-
prise said ferrars when you went
suddenly off your head and jumped
overboard at seluga we never thought
to see you again

 after leaving me for dead and
buried i dont suppose you did said
walter coolly

  the poor chap has not fully recov-
ered yet- murmured booth in an audi-
ble whisper how lucky that weve
found him-for careful treatment
bleeding would about suit his case eh
sir

  come below both of you said fer-
rars scowling at the speaker theres
no need to palaver before all these gap-
ing swabs and he turned and led the
way down into the saloon now
whats this rot about being buried
alive he went on as he turned and
faced walter by the light of the swing
lamp

  the fierce glitter in the bloodshot
eyes warned walter that he would be
appealing to the wrong passion by pro-

voking anger when greed was the card
he had to play

  i wont argue the point he said
im willing to consider-aye and to
maintain-that ive been raving since
you called me into your cabin that night
off seluga and ill go farther and
promise if i ever see england again
not to blab about your throwing things
overboard for the diver to find and
on top of all that ill give you a hint
that may lead you to what youre look-
ing for-the treasure out of the old
galleon but theres something to lie
done in return-something that most
men would do without all this bargain-
ing

  ferrars and booth exchanged glances

  i dont call it bargaining on your
part to offer to forego a lot of
trumped-up charges that you cant
substantiate said ferrars cautiously
what is there to do it must be a
pretty tall order to make you climb
down like this

  its to rescue a couple of english
ladies from a pack of black-hearted
niggers that mean them no good re-
plied walter

  and he went on to narrate his rescue
by the tulwar and his discovery of the
shipwrecked passengers at jogore hid-
ing nothing that had occurred and de-
scribing fully the mysterious power of
hussein over zohrab but he saw that
his hearers were much more interested
in the wealth and luxury of the long-
concealed stronghold than in the fate
hanging over maisie sellon prompted
perhaps by shyness he did not dis-
close her name or that she was the
original of the photograph which had
caused one of his quarrels with ferrars

  this beggar hussein is the same
that was mouching about this ship be-
fore she left dock-youre sure of
that asked ferrars at the conclusion
of walters narrative

  theres no shadow of doubt and in
my mind that fact shows a connection


peoples

between the treasure and this island
was the reply

  ikweve got an old black duffer on
board who knows something he wont
tell remarked ferrars thoughtfully
the same that came nosing about at
seluga he turned up again with the
same old yarn about the treasure hav-
ing been fished up-the day after you
-you went off your head you know
and i took the liberty of kidnaping him
and clapping him under hatches hell
come in handy to say where the stuffs
hidden if this is the place

  and if they aint blowed the lot in
buying all the pretty things mr lynden
talks of put in laban booth

  well chance that laughed ferrars
anyway therell be loot enough to
make the job pay

  all this talk of the plunder and
never a word of the woman in trouble
irritated walter but he strove hard to
master himself

  youll have to go easy because of
the ladies he said you wont have
such a soft thing as it seems there
are a lot of well-armed natives under
good discipline in the place and they
will fight hard at a pinch

  and so by g- will the shipload

of rakehells i have brought from bom-
bay under promise of such a turnip
as this replied ferrars grimly the
women must take their chance but if
we come out on top theyll be all right
never fear the girl that this half-
caste boss is sweet on is a pretty little
bit of goods i dare say he added
with one of his nasty leers

  walter had committed himself or
that look might have altered his plans
he nodded but ignored the question
verbally in his answer

  my notion is that if you ran in
to-night in the dark you might take the
place by surprise he said

  and a very good notion too-mine
as well as yours drawled ferrars
hes been very useful this stray bird

of ours eh booth added the captain
to his confederate but after a sig-
nificant pause i think we have got
about all we want from him

  laban booth sniggered ominously
and began fingering the flap of his hip
pocket but walter had another card
to play-the best in the pack

  i quite understand that it would be
convenient to finish that funeral but
you will have to put it off he said
quietly it would take you a week to
find the channel through the atoll and
then youd end by being blown to where
youll go some day the passage is
full of mines both electric and contact
which  have spent the last week in
studying

  my dear fellow your head is a bit
weak still i was only chaffing of
course i shall be only too glad of
your pilotage ferrars replied with
forced geniality well rouse ship and
get to it at once

  they all rose together

  i will steer you to the opening
said walter then you- will have to
land me and work her through as i
disconnect the mines by the way
telfer the diver is on board still i
suppose that is well i shall want
some one who can work under water
theres no depth and no need for his
divers dress

  ten minutes later the sea hazvk was
heading for the channel with walter
conning her and the surly quarter-
master at the wheel on the bridge

  on deck mark telfer roused from
his bunk was rubbing his sleepy eyes
waiting for orders and looking down
walter caught the flutter of a pink
dressing gown at the door of lenas
cabin

chapter xxi

the passage of the reef

  having brought the sea hawk to the
mouth of the channel walter explained
to ferrars and booth who had re-
the plunder ship



mained close tu him on the bridge the
zigzag course of the passage through
the encircling reef

  you must go dead slow with no
way on her and stop every time i sing
out if you dont want to be blown
-sky high he said  shall give you
the signal in good time before you ap-
proach each mine and you mustnt
come on again till you hear from me
that the wires are disconnected

   what sort of a lookout do they keep
on the island asked ferrars

  a sharp one-to judge by the way
they stopped my attempt at escape re-
plied walter you had better have all
lights covered before you come out into
the lagoon and if you are thinking
of such a thing i shouldnt advise you
to go  without picking me up at the
other side of the reef you will burn
your lingers to a certainty if you try
to approach the island without some
one who knows the ropes to guide you

  ferrars exchanged a grin with laban
booth whose broad face always re-
flected his commanders humor

  blessed if  dont like a chap that
knows his own value he sneered
never fear but what well pick you
up mr lynden we love you too much
to lose you after all the pains weve
been at to find you

  there rf the diver is ready you
had better land us on the atoll re-
plied walter for maisies sake curbing
a wild impulse to tell the pair that they
could murder him as soon as they liked
when they had put the english ladies
at jogore in a place of safety the bit-
ter drop in his cup was that he might
be eating insults and veiled threats to
no purpose for he was sorely vexed
in spirit now whether he had not made
a great mistake powlett ferrars could
be trusted to put in a bold bid for the
treasure but he was a poor pillar to
lean on as a champion of chivalry

  but as walter went along the deck
to go to the boat that was waiting to

put him ashore one ray of comfort
flashed from the clouds that beset him
passing lenas deck-house cabin he
saw a white hand shoot from the door-
way and felt a detaining clutch  his
ann the cabin was in darkness but
the starlight showed the face of lena
ferrars framed in the entrance

  dont trust my brother she whis-
pered no matter what has prompted
this rashness in giving yourself up-
dont trust him for gods sake give
him the slip if you can he will kill
you as soon as you have found the
treasure for him-if you are pinning
your faith to that

  i dont trust him whispered wal-
ter in reply and made as though to
pass on for ferrars and booth were
only a few paces ahead leading the
way to the boat lena too waved him
away but as he turned his back 
her he caught another whisper floating
after him

  im sorry for what  did

  shes human anyway and not the
absolute fiend i thought her thats a
point in my girls favor he reflected
as he went on to the ships side where
mark telfer stood ready to descend
into the waiting boat ferrars and
booth narrowly watched his meeting
with the diver but to his great relief
telfer was equal to the occasion and
merely nodded showing  particular
pleasure at his reappearance

  the sea iiazvk was lying but fifty
yards from the atoll so the trip to
the shore was quickly accomplished
walter noting that the two men who
rowed the boat were strangers to him
-not members of the original crew
a brace of beetle-browed evil-looking
ruffians they were so far as he could
judge in the dim light and certainly
not english he put them down as
spaniards or italians though as they
did not speak he could not be sure of
their nationality

  telfer however threw some light on


peoples

the subject as he stood at walters side
watching the men paddle the boat back
to the ship

  a pair of beauties those eh sir
said the diver two of the new hands
shipped at bombay and not the worst
samples of the crowd by long chalks
well  darent say it before ferrars
but im glad to see you alive mr lyn-
den almost as glad as i am to be
alive myself though that wont be for
long  reckon

  we must do the best we can re-
plied walter i have no real need of
you on the job were on but i asked
to have you with me so that you could
post me in whats happened weve
got a minute or two while they hoist
the boat up and work the ship through
the mouth of the channel just spit
it out as quick as you can

  well said telfer seating himself
on a snag of coral it was given out
that youd gone off your nut and jumped
overboard though i knew better than
that next morning i was sent down
and fetched up a lot of old truck-
swords and guns and what not-that
ill swear in the court of law werent
there the day before you mind my
celling you id covered a lot more of
the sea bottom that first dive than ever
i let on

  i can bear you out in that said
walter ferrars chucked the stuff
overboard himself it was because i
saw him that i was knocked silly in his
cabin that night

  knocked silly were you said
telfer then that was why they came
south from seluga after id done my
dive-to dump you hereabouts they
were messing about among these south-
ern atolls for a day or two with boats
out at night aad no end of jabber be-
tween skipper and booth and then
away we went for bombay and back
again after shipping a fresh crew of
as bloody-minded unwashed dago cut-
throats as ever stunk out a sailors

boarding house ferrars must have
offered a reward for condemned mur-
derers that had escaped i reckon it
promised to be too thick a cruise for
me and i tried to do a bunk but it
didnt come off then we came back
here and im called out of my bunk
for some sort of racket that i dont
rightly understand except that im
main glad to see you in the flesh again
mr lynden i never thought to
walter patted him on the back
there was no time for gush ferrars
was talking about some old nigger
theyd brought from seluga he said
hes on board now isnt he

  aye-a cruel job replied telfer
the old chap came worrying around
in a canoe and at first they stood him
off then they changed their minds
invited him aboard and clapped him in
irons the canoe they stove in so that
the poor black devils in her had to
swim through the sharks for the shore
ferrars and booth go down and do
things to that old man every night-its
my belief with hot irons anyway it
makes him scream

  walter shuddered but a hail came
across the water and claimed him the
sea hawk had begun to forge slowly
into the mouth of the channel and the
voice from her was that of laban
booth 

  were on the move sing out when
were to stop

  you can keep on and stop twenty
yards from the first bend walter re-
plied and bidding the diver follow he
led the way along the bank of the
channel to the first mine which was
just round the first acute angle in the
zed it was a contact mine designed
to be fired by a passing vessel striking
a wire stretched taut from an iron
peg in either bank and communicating
by a branch wire with the explosive
chamber under water it was not by
any means a perfect contrivance as
all that was necessary to make the pas-
the plunder ship



sage safe was to detach the wire from
one of the pegs and pay out the slack
till it dropped to the bottom clear of
the ships keel

  walter correctly guessed that the ar-
rangement had been devised for the
convenience of the tulwar and other
vessels belonging to jogore which when
requiring to pass would land a man
to lower the wires to safety and tighten
them up again when the vessel had
traversed the danger point the secur-
ity of the channel in fact depended
upon the locality of the pegs and the
secret of their use being only known
to vessels authorized to use it with
that knowledge any vessel authorized
or not could have passed safely to and
fro at will but for an additional pre-
caution close to the inner or lagoon
end of the channel there were a couple
of mines contrived to be fired by elec-
tricity from some point on the island
the weak point in this part of the sys-
tem being that these two mines de-
pended for their efficacy on the lookout
that was kept

  walter had only found the iron peg
after a prolonged exploration made
possible by his enforced idleness on the
atoll during the past week they were
driven into the rock a foot below high-
water mark and at full tide they with
their coil of extra wire were invisible
either from the channel or the bank
it was to this discovery that he owed
the inspiration of the idea that now
possessed him

  you had better not watch me too
closely he said to telfer when they
came to the first angle in the zigzag
passage it may come in handy to you
to be able to swear that you couldnt
find the place i shall want you later
on

  he swung himself over the shelving
bank and found the peg under the
water having done what was needful
he hailed the sea hawk that she might
safely round the bend when she had

     

done so he hailed again that she must
proceed slowly and then stop as before
at the next angle as he did not im-
mediately reappear mark telfer went
and peered over the bank and saw him
frantically busy below his body sway-
ing apd one arm waving with a curious
circular motion it was much too dark
for walters movements to be seen from
the now slowly receding ship and in
any case they would have been unin-
telligible to those on board for the
expert in subaqueous matters however
they had a grim significance

  why youre never- the diver

was beginning in a throaty whisper
when walter silenced him with an angry
hiss

  the sooner you realize that a word
too much may cost your life the bet-
ter whispered walter as he rejoined
him on the bank as it is we shall
have to hustle if they are not to smell a
rat

  call me a fool i see your game
now murmured telfer as he raced
across the reef in walters wake to the
site of the second mine at the next
angle in the channel a contented grin
had replaced the look of alarmed sur-
prise that had furrowed his good-hu-
mored face at first sight of his com-
panions maneuvers

  at the second mine exactly the same
performance was gone through the sea
hawk passed the dangerous point in
safety and walter was again slow in
returning to the bank after she had
glided by but this time mark-telfer
called forth no rebuke by unnecessary
comments

  now this is where you come in
said walter as he rejoined the diver on
the bank and led the way to the next
and last angle in the zigzag waterway
this is an electric mine and were
going to spoil it once for all youve
got the tools i asked to be put in the

hussein is busy

  when hussein ali was awakened by
a frightened attendant in the gray of
dawn with the news that a strange
steamer had entered the lagoon during
the night and was anchored or lying to
within long rifle shot of the island he
cursed his informant for the son of an
owl who had mistaken the tulwar the
sultans own steam yacht for an alien
vessel but it was not his habit to
leave matters to chance and though
he did not cease to curse he hurried
into his clothes and quitted his apart-
ment

  the palace of jogore was built
as has been stated some way inland
and for purposes of privacy out of
sight of the lagoon to verify or re-
fute the astounding statement of the
trembling menial hussein had to pro-
ceed to the summit of a wooded hill
outside the walls where by day it was
usual to keep a lookout man posted
by night the precaution was dispensed
with and indeed such was the con-
fidence in the secrecy of the channel
and the efficacy of its protection that
even by day the watchman was only
placed there to signal the arrival of the
tulwar from her periodical trips

  there was a stone hut under the brow
of the hill on the landward side in
which was kept the electrical apparatus
for firifig the two mines at the lagoon
end of the channel and the hut also
served to give shelter to the watchman
this man a swarthy arab had been
the first to discover the presence of a
steamer in the lagoon and hussein
found him still staring at her through
his telescope

  snatching the glass from the man
hussein leveled it and saw at a glance
that what he had believed to be the

impossible had happened that coal-
black vessel of three thousand tons was
certainly not the smart little steamer
in which zohrab was wont to idle about
the lagoon and which was used for
importing european goods from bom-
bay there was no doubt that for the
first time in the history of that curious
kingdom the inviolate channel had
been found and safely passed

  but husseins scrutiny was prolonged
and told him more than that he
recognized the intruder as the sea
hawk-the steamer to which he had
paid that nocturnal visit in the royal
albert dock on the eve of her much-
advertised departure in quest of the
lost galleons treasure-the steamer
whose expedition he had taken a hur-
ried voyage to europe to prevent by
any means as he shut the telescope
with a snap he remembered how he
had crept aboard her with a knife
ready for powlett ferrars and had
stumbled on honest walter lynden
instead

  hussein ali though too cosmopolitan
to be a strict observer of the rites of
his creed was imbued with the true
mahommedan fatalism and the ap-
pearance of the sea hawk did not alto-
gether disconcert him it was disquiet-
ing certainly but what was ordained
had to be and matters had not gone
so far yet that by luck or judgment-
the latter chiefly-he might not per-
suade fate to stand him in good stead
it would be time enough to accept the
decree as against him when it had been
openly declared-not a moment before
-and in the meanwhile he would do
his level best to prevent that disaster
it might be that he could twist the
advent of the sea hawk to his own
purposes

  with this philosophy strong upon
him he bade the lookout man report
the slightest movement of the steamer
or so far as they could be observed of
the crew and made his way back to the
the plunder ship



palace of jogore for the moment he
put from his mind vague speculations
as to how the steamer had safely passed
the contact mines in the channel or
why she had come and set himself face
to face with the actual fact of her
presence in the lagoon and its bearing
upon existing circumstances

  these on the whole were not quite
to his liking-apart from the tremen-
dous one that had dragged him from
his bed two hours earlier than was
his wont he had retired to rest on
the previous night happy in the belief
that walter lynden had been slain
proud of his victory over maisie sellon
satisfied that his policy of effecting a
more or less forced union between
zohrab and an english girl would bind
his nominal master in closer bonds than
ever and yet as he had closed his eyes
in sleep he had been conscious of a
slight uneasiness

  this had been due to the behavior
of zohrab after the interview at which
consent had been wrung from maisie
as a price of her lovers life-the lover
be it remembered whom hussein be-
lieved to be already dead dazed at
first from the effect of the hypnotic
pressure put upon him zohrab had
grown sullen as the influence wore off
and finally almost rebellious husseins
uneasiness was due to a half doubt
whether he would be able to keep his
subject up to the mark till the return
of the tulwar with some individual able
to travesty a marriage service

  by the time he reached the palace
inclosure his active brain had ham-
mered out of an unpromising situation
the germ of a very promising plot which
should serve two ends the chief one
was the destruction once for all of
zohrabs scruples by hurrying on the
union with maisie the second had ref-
erence to the final disposition of the
sea hawk that the steamer had a
crew strong enough to attempt violence
he was not aware but he knew that the

magic word treasure must be the
cause of her arrival and he had no
intention of allowing her to depart the
jealously guarded secret of jogore was
not to be endangered through sentiment
about the lives of a few seamen

  on passing through the guarded
gates into the inclosure instead of go-
ing indoors he turned aside and made
for the quarters where the armed re-
tainers lived he saw at a glance that
the rumor of the strange ship had pen-
etrated here the men were hurrying
on their accouterments the air was
filled with a buzz of excitement and
amid the crowd stalked to and fro the
sikh commander of the forces of jo-
gore twenty years before mirzah
khan had vanished mysteriously from
his regiment at rawal pindi after
shooting his colonel and there was still
a big reward offered by the indian
government for his capture zohrabs
father had had a genius for spiriting
away and turning to his own uses male-
factors who had made the mainland too
hot to hold them

  seeing hussein this man came for-
ward and saluted

  there is to be a fight at last o
hussein ali sahib-a fight after all
these years he said with a gleam in
his eye i shall not have drilled these
rascals for nothing after all

  hussein laughed a little at the others
enthusiasm it is well to be prepared
mirzah khan but this little surprise
may after all be settled by subtler
methods than your strong soldier ways
how do you account for this vessel
having passed the contact mines in the
channel through the atoll there is a
hanging ahead for some one who has
been remiss in his duty

  that mongrel son of a dog ayoob
who commands the tulwar is respon-
sible anyway replied mirzah khan
between whom and the chief of the
sister service there was a long-stand-
ing jealousy when she went out the


peoples

other day the lazy wretch who was
landed on the reef to let her pass must
have omitted to brace up the wires when
she had gone by then this ship comes
along hits by the will of allah on
the passage and lo there is an enemy
within our gates ayoob should hang
he shall if as seems likely your
view is the right one said hussein to
whom this explanation had already oc-
curred now take orders from me
mirzah khan he proceeded i have
need of this ship and her people before
your lust of blood can be sated and for
the present the armed strength of jo-
gore must be concealed details i leave
to you but no hint of the discipline
and the numbers at our disposal must
be disclosed if as is possible some of
the people from that ship come as the
invited guests of his highness to the
palace you understand me

  it is an ambush that your excel-
lency prepares nodded the renegade
soldier my men shall vanish as
though swallowed by the earth the
sword that is to drink blood in the end
can stay its thirst knowing that it is
to drink

  one more instruction and i have
done said hussein has that relic
of bygone times the english sailor
who plays the ghost got over his sick-
ness yet he ought long ago to have
been knocked on the head but he may
be useful to-day

  the sikh made a gesture of con-
tempt i heard from a man who
passed his hut last night that he was
drunk and singing he replied

  then you shall sober him said
hussein he alone as you know has
charge of the atoll and the things that
are thereon go to the old man as
soon as you have made your disposi-
tions here and tell him to repair to
the atoll at once keeping his boat be-
hind the island so that he will not be
seen from the steamer inform him
that the contact mines are disarranged

and instruct him to wind up the wires
left slack by the tulwar thus what-
ever befalls here in jogore shall yon-
der steamer be caught like a rat in a
trap

  mirzah khan promised to dispatch
bob kent to the reef within half an
hour and hussein passed into the pal-
ace his first visit was to the apart-
ment of zohrab who had to be aroused
from sleep to hear the news and who
as hussein had expected was very
wrath that the mines had proved such
a failure in the hour of need not
that zohrab had the slightest wish for
any one to be hurt by them but their
construction had been his pride and
amusement for a whole year and he
was annoyed by the twinkle of scorn
which hussein purposely threw into his
glance

  i always told your highness that
our strength was rather in the secrecy
of the channel than in contrivances so
liable to break down hussein said
with a trace of reproach however
perhaps it is as well that it has hap-
pened so who knows what the end
of this intrusion may be at least it
may cause the abandonment of the mar-
riage about which your highness first
blows hot and then cold

  looking up zohrab caught the full
power of husseins baleful eyes which
backed up by the insidious words ac-
companying it once more vanquished
the weaker soul

  the marriage shall not be abandoned
for forty strange vessels in the lagoon
cried zohrab impetuously i trust to
you to carry it through and rid me of
all interference by cunning if force
fails us though surely we are strong
enough in men and arms not to fear
the crew of a trading steamer

  hussein in a flash of thought de-
cided not to say yet that the strange
ship was the sea hawk if zohrab
had known that fact such was his par-
tiality for walter lynden that he
the plunder ship



might have been openly hostile to the
captain who hacl ill-treated him and
for the present civility to ferrars was
essential to his scheme

  now that i know your highness
mind i will certainly carry the matter
through said hussein i see my
way clear already but in order to suc-
ceed it may be necessary to invite some
of the people from the steamer to come
to the palace and appear friendly with
them your highness has no objection
to this course

  zohrab bound in chains by those elec-
tric eyes laughed hysterically i ob-
ject to nothing that will give me maisie
sellon he cried

  it was ever husseins way to strike
while the iron was hot and he went
away at once having interviewed the
chief butler of the establishment and
made sundry arrangements in other de-
partments of the huge household he
set out for the landing stage

  but he first dispatched a messenger
to the garden wing with a note for mrs
sellon couched in these terms

  an unexpected opportunity has oc-
curred you may prepare your daugh-
ter to be ready sooner than was ex-
pected it would not be well for her
to be taken by surprise

chapter xxiii

the arrangements for a wedding

  when the sea hazvk had taken up
her position within a mile of jogore
under cover of the darkness ferrars
ordered all hands save the deck watch
to turn in for a few hours sleep by
walters advice the watch was strong
and well armed but nothing happened
to disturb the repose of those on board

  no one preventing him walter had
retired to his old cabin as a matter of
course and was glad to find his sea kit
and other small possessions just as he
had left them powlett ferrars had
either been too preoccupied to meddle

with them or had carefully preserved
them in case he was called upon to
substantiate his version of how his chief
mate left the ship

  the brilliant tropical day had not
long broken over the lagoon when
walter quitted his bunk and went out
on deck mindful to play the part al-
lotted to him-that of captains guest
-he lounged about with ostentatious
irresponsibility but he took particular
note of what he saw the crew were
busy washing down decks and he saw
at once thattelfers description of the
newly shipped hands was no exaggera-
tion an uglier set of mongrel riffraff
he had never set eyes on

  laban booth who was in charge of
the deck took no notice of him but
almost immediately powlet ferrars
came out of his room and joined him
the captain had brought out his spy-
glass and took a long survey of the
curving coast line of the island wooded
nearly everywhere to the waters edge
with luxuriant growth and smiling
peacefully in the morning sun

  i dont see this wonderful castle
or whatever it is of yours ferrars
growled

  it is hidden in a dip of the ground
behind that hill to the eastward re-
plied walter as i told you the whole
policy of those who have been running
the place has been to keep it concealed
that was what set me thinking that
it owed its origin to the treasure from
the old galleon

  ferrars made no comment but con-
tinued his scrutiny

  and that white dome in the trees
near the pier-that will be a temple
he asked as he moved his glass round
to the buildings that covered the en-
trance to the subterranean passage

  walter saw no reason why he should
give all his knowledge away at the out-
set so he replied that the building was
a sort of guardroom for the men who
watch at the pier it would be time
enough to tell of the underground way
when ferrars had shown how he was
going to behave about maisie

  lenas appearance on deck put an
end to further discussion ferrars
greeted his sister with a harshly bois-
terous laugh and his first words
showed that he was not aware that she
had seen and spoken to walter on the
previous night

  heres mr lynden turned up again
been having a good time on this merry
island while we were weeping our eyes
out over him as shark food was all
the explanation he offered

  lena who looked paler and thinner
than during the voyage out welcomed
walter coldly evincing no curiosity as
to what had happened to him while
away from the ship or surprise at his
return but on her brother turning his
back to receive the announcement of
the steward that breakfast was ready
in the saloon she placed her finger on
her lips and raised her drooping eye-
lids to reveal one brief flash of warning

  during the meal at which ferrars
his sister and walter alone were pres-
ent the commander of the sea hawk
markedly abstained from any reference
to the business in hand or to the in-
formation given him by walter as to
the extraordinary state of affairs on
the island nor did he allude to the
original purpose for which the steamer
had visited those seas he affected a
jocular vein rallied lena on her want
of appetite and expatiated on the su-
periority of brandy and soda to coffee
as a breakfast beverage

  chafing inwardly at being able to
gather no clew to his intentions wal-
ter fell in with his evident desire and
avoided the forbidden subjects know-
ing the cunning of the man-a cunning
less subtle than but quite as danger-
ous as that of hussein ali-he boded
no good from this reticence on vital
matters but knowing also the un-
governable temper of ferrars he was

anxious not to provoke him till maisie
was safe and so he too attempted
to be frivolous

  lena who had been watching walter
furtively seemed relieved by his de-
meanor and thenceforward made a
nervous effort to join in the trivial con-
versation though it was not a success
except so far as it gave walter an
opportunity of seeing that a change had
come over her from the sensuous
self-possessed woman who had made
advances scarcely decent she had in
one week grown into a highly strung
creature whose forced gayety seemed
perilously on the verge of hysteria

  the ordeal of that breakfast in the
saloon of the sea hazvk though it lived
for years in the memory of two who
partook of it was not unduly pro-
longed it was broken by the advent
of laban booth who came rapidly
down the stairs and whispered in the
captains ear

  a boat putting off from the shore
good business exclaimed ferrars
rising i wanted the first overture
to come from them it will be easier
to play the virtuous trader on board
than on shore i couldnt trust myself
there without a pack of my bombay
ducks at heel and their ugly faces
would spoil the part

  he led the way on deck the others
following and took a long look through
his telescope at the boat that had just
started from the pier

  by gad lynden id begun to think
you were fooling us but youve been
talking gospel truth he exclaimed
the thing looks like a great state
barge pulls eight oars and is covered
with gold paint they must be an oofy
lot of niggers to put on side like that

  he took another look through the tel-
escope and then passed it to walter

  you know the beggars and i dont
he said who is the boss in the stern
under the big umbrella is that his
majesty the king of the cannibal
the plunder ship



islands who wants to wed the lady pas-
senger from the tiber

  disgusted with ferrars tone which
under the circumstances was hardly
that of an english gentleman walter
took the glass and scrutinized the on-
coming boat

  no that is not the so-called sultan
zohrab he replied it is hussein
ali the headman i was telling you
of who has zohrab under his thumb-
the same who sneaked aboard the sea
hawk in the albert dock

  ah the gentleman with peculiar no-
tions of hospitality said ferrars a
right-down foxy-looking specimen he
is too well it will be a pleasure to
meet him and try conclusions with him
with his own weapons but you mustnt
show lynden if im to come out top-
side of him in the business between
us he will have to think that the ship
is here by a fluke if he guessed that
id been posted in the ways of the
place i should have to fight him with
all my cards on the table

  walter saw the truth of the remark
and was quick to take a hint which he
knew would be enforced anyhow

  in that case  had better got out of
sight before the boat comes alongside
he said i will go into my cabin and
leave you to deal with hussein but
for gods sake captain ferrars re-
member that an english girls honor is
at stake and that this brute has the
cunning of the devil

  ive got a bit of that myself mut-
tered ferrars with a grin as walter
moved away and shut himself into his
deck-house cabin bubbling with rage at
the callous brutality with which his
appeal had been ignored lie was angry
with himself too for having placed
maisies fate in such hands as those
of powlett ferrars but what else could
he have done he asked himself in
extenuation with joannas threat of
poison still ringing in his ears

  it was not long before the sound of

oars was borne upon the lazy air and
stationing himself at the open window
of his cabin but screened by the drawn
curtains he waited to hear what passed
did the representative of jogore come
as an open or a secret foe to the in-
truder for with the lawless record
of the concealed stronghold fresh in
his mind walter was assured that he
did not come as a friend with the
wild temper of iowlett ferrars to
reckon with the first attitude taken by
hussein seemed to have a tremendous
bearing on maisies fate

  the question was answered in the
hail that was interchanged between the
advancing boat and those on the deck
of the steamer

  may i come aboard captain you
have some goods to trade with us poor
islanders floated up in husseins silk-
iest accents

  right you are i staiy by while we
throw you a rope returned ferrars
in his heartiest sailor fashion the
preliminaries of the impending duel of
wits were at least to be amicable

  there was a pause and then a pid-
pad of sandals on the deck told that
hussein had come up the side and was
approaching the group outside the cabin
for some reason best known to him-
self lie had discarded his semi-euro-
pean attire for this occasion and was
arrayed as an oriental of high degree
from behind the curtain walter saw
the snowy white garments of a mus-
sulman magnate fluttering within two
yards of him as hussein bent low in
homage to the commander of the vessel

  glad to see you sir-all the more
that we didnt expect it said ferrars
affecting the same blniv manner you
seem to have a snug place here though
its charted as uninhabited

  ah you will doubtless have that
error rectified- -when you get back to
england was husseins noncommittal
reply if you will visit us-on shore
you will find that we are not unworthy


peoples

of mention on the maps i am here
to bring you an invitation from his
highness syed bin zohrab the sultan
of jogore to come up to his palace

  walter listening with greedy ears
wondered what this meant and from
the silence that followed he guessed
that ferrars was equally puzzled
could it be a treacherous design to
lure the strangers on to the island
overpower them by superior numbers
and slay them to a man that some
such suspicion crossed the mind of
ferrars was made evident by his re-
ception of the invitation

  thank you he said presently with
a neat sarcasm that the subtle mind
of hussein must have appreciated im
not fond of landing at foreign ports
where there isnt a british consul

  ah we havent such a luxury yet
replied hussein and walter could
imagine the innocent smile that accom-
panied the admission perhaps after
you have had the island charted and
ships call regularly that honor may be
accorded to us his highness is more
than half an englishman by inclina-
tion at any rate it is because he
requires the services of one whom he
regards as a fellow countryman that he
begs you to visit the palace

  he wants something of me eh
said ferrars with an eagerness which
walter growing sharp by reason of his
surroundings could well understand
the commander of the sea hazvk was
keen to learn the card which his oppo-
nent meant to lay on the table so that
he could judge whether it was a gen-
uine lead or not

  and then the card was played and
walter listening in a frenzy of wrath
knew that whatever else remained be-
hind husseins bid for the services
of powlett ferrars was real enough in
design and intention

  yes captain his highness wants you
to render him an obligation for which
he is prepared to pay very handsomely

came the obnoxiously bland tones in
answer what do you say to a thou-
sand bright english sovereigns no
bankers drafts or securities that you
might under the circumstances reason-
ably doubt but sterling coin the fact
is that a very pretty little romance has
been taking place on our island his
highness has fallen in love with a young
english lady saved from a wreck has
wooed her and has won her consent
to become his consort you as the
commander of a british ship have the
legal power to perform the marriage
ceremony in the absence of a priest of
your religion i see that you take my
meaning

  the proposal was received with a
ripple of laughter blending the snigger
of laban booth with the rich contralto
of lena and interrupted by the harsh
chuckle of powlett ferrars

  so im to play the parson eh and
rake in a thumping fee said the cap-
tain of the sea hawk well mr-i
didnt catch your name-hussein ali
is it-you seem to be as well posted
in our laws as you are in our lingo
and whats more youve shown why
you are so pressing ill take on the
job with pleasure when shall i
come 

  at once if convenient replied
hussein if you will land in one of
your own boats i will return now in
mine and wait for you at the pier
yonder

  you will want some witnesses
how many of my crew shall i bring
asked ferrars with a trace of his old
suspicion

  hussein knowing what was in his
mind and also what was his own ulti-
mate design was prompt with a cor-
dial invitation to the whole crew

  honest sailormen like to dance at
a wedding he explained blandly

  mine dont i only wanted-but
there its all right i will just bring a
boats crew ferrars replied and wal-
the plunder ship



ter felt that he could supply the miss-
ing words in the captains sentence
he only wanted to assure himself of
husseins good faith by no objection
being raised to his being backed by a
strong following

  again came the pid-pad of sandals
and from the other sounds outside it
was evident that hussein was going
back to his boat a moment later
the voice of the surly quartermaster
sharpe was heard calling for hands
to man the captains gig and then
the door of walters cabin was flung
open and ferrars stood before him

  you heard all that palaver asked
the commander of the sea hazvk eying
his ex-chief officer maliciously

  walters condition after listening to
the calm acquiescence of ferrars to
husseins proposal was only too piti-
ably noticeable

  yes i heard he stammered in his
helplessness but surely captain fer-
rars you do not mean to-

  i mean to use this royal niggers
need of a parson to find out where he
keeps the plunder-if theres any left
interrupted ferrars roughly and
when ive found it i shall lift it dont
make any mistake about that it was
your own notion you know youve
no cause to whine

  i make no secret of it-i held that
out as a bait to induce you to save
maisie-i mean the english girl who
is threatened with this outrage re-
plied walter in his grief and anger
making a slip which the other was
quick to pounce upon

  so you speak of the lady by her
christian name eh said ferrars
showing his teeth  thought i wasnt
far out when from the fuss you made
about her i spotted her as the original
of that pretty picture and he pointed
to the framed photograph of maisie
sellon over the bunk

  waite kept his hands down with an
effort and checked the rage on his lips

this scoundrel was his only mainstay
and through force of circumstances he
had sought him himself

  you can make your mind easy about
one thing continued ferrars with an
evil grin i am not going to marry
the girl to the king of the cannibal
islands that is to say unless i take
over the kingdom myself a throne in
these parts would be a bit lonely with-
out a consort and shes a dear little
thing

  he was gone before walter realiz-
ing the full horror of his words reached
the cabin door-to find it slammed in
his face by a dozen scowling ruffians
and himself a prisoner

chapter xxiv

the death warrant

  while hussein ali on the deck of
the sea hawk was preferring his re-
quest to powlett ferrars maisie was
walking in the private garden attached
to the wing occupied by herself and
her mother since a reluctant consent
had been wrung from her as a con-
dition of walters life being spared
she had spent much time near the
locked wicket gate in the hope of seeing
joanna again  but either by accident
or design zohrabs sister had kept out
of the way

  during those sad days the poisoned
sweetmeat was maisies most cherished
possession and it never left her per-
son walking or sleeping the little
sticky lump alone seemed to stand be-
tween her and unimaginable horrors
and her purpose was quite clear with
regard to it having satisfied herself
that walter was beyond the power of
his enemies she would fulfill her part
of the contract by going through the
ceremony of marriage with zohrab and
would then immediately swallow the
poison

  with her mother she had almost
ceased to have any conversation not


peoples

from temper but because the good
ladys talk was nothing but wearisome
reiteration of the brilliant prospects
ahead as the wife of an eastern
prince maisie would of course have
a house at queens gate attend all the
drawing-rooms and shine as a leader
of london society

  when you are once her highness
and have got the jogore diamonds safe
at your own order in the strong room
of a west end bank there must be
an end of this preposterous island
mrs sellon had remarked when sketch-
ing the splendid program a couple
of months every second year you might
manage perhaps but as a permanent
residence comfortable as they have
made usj the place is impossible

  it is difficult to analyze mrs sellons
conduct toward her daughter at this
time probably her motives like most
human ones were mixed though it is
more charitable to suppose that she was
more actuated by a real desire for
maisies welfare than by an unreason-
ing hatred of walter lynden

  no rumor of the arrival of the sea
hawk in the lagoon had penetrated the
carefully guarded garden wing and
maisie had no means of finding out the
nature of the unexpected opportunity
mentioned in the message from hussein
that had been duly imparted to her by
her mother at breakfast the hint to
hold herself in readiness had in-
creased her eagerness to see joanna to
learn particulars but no brown-faced
lame girl appeared at the bars of the
gate

  she had turned away from the gate
in disappointment to saunter again in
the shade of the trees when a low voice
called miss sellon and looking back
she saw zohrab himself regarding her
wistfully from behind the bars her
first impulse was to return at once to
the house but she checked it on re-
membering joannas advice to if pos-
sible plead with her brother alone

strangely enough considering their
proposed forced relationship the young
sultan had never inspired her with the
same loathing horror as his bear leader
hussein had and she nerved herself
to take the opportunity

  despite his great height and imposing
figure there was nothing very terrible
about zohrab as he stood shrinkingly
at the other side of the gate he looked
half inclined to run away himself

  i hope that i did not frighten you
he said timidly i very much wanted

to see-to explain that-

  taking his measure rapidly maisie
interrupted him with a wave of her
hand

  there is nothing for you to explain
and not much for you to apologize for
she said weighing her words carefully

  if you were a european you would
deserve to be whipped for your con-
duct to a defenseless girl but as you
are i suppose a savage with a smat-
tering of education and a pretense of
being half civilized your behavior was
only to be expected

  she could not have chosen a better
way with him every word touched
him on the raw and he winced as
though slashed with a keen-edged blade
the white blood in him surged up to
defend the assault on his pet vanity
and he hurried on the explanation
which to do him justice had brought
him there

  you are harsh when you should
really pity he said i came to set
your mind at rest-to say that i have
acted toward you under compulsion

and that i deeply regret-

  one moment broke in maisie
will you prove your words by fore-
going your mad intention and by send-
ing me and mr lynden and my mother
of course safe to bombay

  i will-that is to say i will en-
deavor to do so replied zohrab with
the air of a man who had been set a
the plunder ship



task which he doubts his ability to per-
form

  but what on earth is to prevent you
you are master here said maisie de-
termined to push her advantage to the
full

  in name i am ruler of jogore but
in fact hussein does as he likes with
me said zohrab i know not how
it is but when he is present and to
a certain extent when he is away my
will seems to have passed into his keep-
ing he has gone out to a ship that
came into the lagoon during the night
so i made an effort to come and say
what i have

  he must hypnotize you or mesmerize
you or something remarked maisie
vaguely she was beginning to feel a
certain sympathy for this great help-
less creature who had threatened to do
her so foul a wrong you dont really
wish to marry me then she added
unable to resist the feminine luxury
of teasing him now that her horizon
seemed to be brightening

  the awkward question caused zohrab
a good deal of agitation but he man-
aged to answer it without falling into
the trap laid for a rude reply it
would not have occurred to me to pre-
sume with such a proposal if it had
not been forced on me by hussein he
said modestly and then in his irritation
at the chain that galled him he flashed
forth an angry protest

  it is unbearable that i zohrab of
jogore should be driven to such vile
behavior against my better impulses
i who have the power to slay this
hussein by lifting my finger the peo-
ple here love me miss sellon and my
sister too for what my father and
grandfather have done for them at
my bidding they would strangle hus-
sein before my eyes yet such is his in-
fluence that i dare not say the word
i have tried to do so many times but
always something has seemed to grip
me and tie my tongua

  for the first time during her brief
acquaintance with him zohrab looked
and spoke like a man and maisie with
quick intuition treated him as one she
saw her way with the clearness of one
fighting for life to obtain a weapon
more potent and more pleasant to use
than joannas poisoned sweetmeat

  i see that you are afraid that when
hussein returns this influence of his
will be as strong as ever she said after
a pause

  i fear it believe me as much on
your account as mine was the reply

  i believe you and i can show you
a way to shake off this influence once
for all if as you say your people are
devoted to you said maisie is there
any one who would obey your written
orders-some one in authority who
knows and would respect your signa-
ture

  zohrab peered at her through the bars
of the gate his handsome features il-
lumined with the dawn of hope it
was a strange position-the girl offer-
ing to show to her would-be abductor
a way out of the business and the man
clutching at the notion with every sign
of joy

  there is mirzah khan who com-
mands my soldiers said zohrab he
can read and would die to save me
he obeys hussein with the fidelity of
a dog only because he believes that
the orders hussein gives him come
from me that is the way of the brute
miss sellon hussein gives orders to
my people-which he has himself wrung
from me god knows how and they
poor devils execute them blindly
thinking to please me

  well i am going to wring an order
from you this time said maisie look-
ing him boldly in the face have you
got any writing materials about you

  no but i will soon fetch some
zohrab exclaimed eagerly and he dis-
appeared from the gate to return
breathless in a few minutes with a large


peoples

sheet of official paper and the latest
thing in stylographic pens

  now write in whatever language
mirzah khan understands said maisie
firmly draw up an order to him to
make hussein ali a prisoner and to
execute him by whatever method is
usual on the island within twenty-four
hours -

  zohrabs face fell and he shook his
head i will do as you wish he said
commencing to write but  fear that
it will be useless do you know that
i have written out death warrants for
hussein a dozen times in the last seven
years and something has always held
me back as with a vise from handing
them to the executive officer i have
torn them up and things have gone on
as before

  they will not this time said maisie
with grim insistence thus encouraging
his pen to travel faster till he affixed
his signature at the foot

  now give it to me she said com-
pelling him to meet her gaze as he was
about to put the document in the breast
pocket of his coat

  to you he faltered

  yes to me maisie went on boldly
then if you cannot stand firm against
hussein and keep your promise to re-
lease us i will make use of it and you
may be sure that nothing will hold me
back from doing so i shall not how-
ever let this come into mirzah khans
hands except as a last resort for i am
a woman and have no wish to send the
scoundrel to death but in self-defense

  all this time she was speaking she
kept her hand held out for the docu-
ment and as she finished zohrab
passed it through the bars of the gate
subservient as ever to the stronger will
maisie hid it in the silk blouse which
the native dirzee had made for her
and looked up to proffer her thanks
but found that zohrab had turned away
from her and was gazing across the
walled inclosure toward his portion of

the palace at the same time the voices
of persons advancing from that direc-
tion fell upon her ears and a moment
later hussein came into view accom-
panied by a european in the dress of a
ship captain

  hussein was talking gayly to his com-
panion who was looking about him with
evident interest at the wonders of jo-
gore while the two were yet afar
off something struck maisie as familiar
in the deeply lined cruel face of the
european but it was not till they were
within ten paces of the gate that she
recognized with a thrill of horror the
man who had insulted her in the rail-
way carriage in london not two months
ago even as she recognized him his
fierce eyes were fastened on her face
and she turned and fled from the gate
back to the garden wing without wait-
ing to see if the recognition was mutual

  hussein who had been in high spirits
before expanded into open hilarity at
the sight of the girls rapid retreat
from the gate his suqmse he adroitly
hid

  there he whispered to powlett
ferrars i dont think you quite be-
lieved me when i said that miss sel-
lons consent had been won that
pretty little scene ought to convince
you

  it does so ferrars replied gnaw-
ing his straggling mustache and taking
stock of the tall young half-caste who
came forward to meet them

  hussein allowed his gushing mood
to overflow at the approach of his
master

  ah your highness this is too bad
of us to interrupt so pleasant a meet-
ing he began i trust that we have
not alarmed your bride by our abrupt
intrusion-a little maiden coyness eh
this is captain ferrars of the steam-
ship sea hawk who has been good
enough to promise to satisfy miss sel-
lons scruples by performing the need-
the plunder ship



ful rites a marriage celebrated by
the commander of a british vessel in
the absence of a clergyman is quite
binding and legal

  zohrab was an object pitiable to be-
hold as husseins glittering orbs
fixed him it was as though he were
rent in twain by a thousand devils
pulling different ways powlett fer-
rars watched him curiously

  i-i dont question that-the legal
part you know-and it is very kind of

the captain but-

  that but was enough for hussein
scenting a revolt he exerted all his
powers and sent out a mesmeric wave
that gripped zohrab body and soul and
tore all his good resolutions from their
moorings

but asked hussein very quietly
but-but i fear i am putting him
to too much trouble concluded zoh-
rab with weak surrender in his tones

  it is no trouble sultan and friend
hussein has promised me a princely
fee said ferrars forcing one of his
hearty laughs

  zohrabs protest was therefore left
unspoken and accepting the situation
he turned to accompany the other two
to the palace they had not taken
many steps before the tall form of
mirzah khan was seen hastening to-
ward them with lengthy strides the
sikh warrior saluted and beckoned
hussein aside

  kent has been to the atoll and has
returned he whispered low there
has been miracle work going forward
the old sailorman reports that the
contact mines are coupled up and in
position that ship captains vessel
must be a phantom to have passed over
them unscathed and the supersti-

tious indian cast a look of awe at
ferrars

 for a moment hussein was non-
plused but soon a smile illumined his
subtle face my good mirzah he
said let us leave a belief in spirits to
the denizens of the neighboring islands
there has been human agency at work
keep your men out of sight but well
in hand and be ready for any emer-
gency act only on verbal instructions
from myself or on orders bearing the
sign manual of his highness-then let
it be unquestioning and without com-
promise

  mirzah khan saluted and withdrew
leaving hussein plunged in deep
thought his keen brain had pounced
upon half the truth walter lynden
was not dead but was or had been
upon the atoll and joanna whom he
had fondly regarded as his firm ally
had really tried to impose upon him
with the trumped-up story of the hated
englishmans death

  she must have been in alliance with
him-have been helping him to escape
hussein snarled between his clenched
teeth lynden must have discovered
the mines passed the sea hazvk
through and then readjusted the con-
tact wires so as to make his own terms
with ferrars it is well that i am
warned in time-but joanna

  pulling himself together he hurried
on to rejoin zohrab and ferrars who
had sauntered on ahead as he came
up ferrars turned to him and said

  i have just been explaining a little
matter to his highness this festive
marriage ceremony must take place on
board my ship it wont be legal un-
less it is performed under the british
flag

iii-feature stuff

jimmy hamilton to whom all the world was an undeveloped picture film
and to whom god had given a double-edged case-hardened tongue for the
purpose of shooting out verbal lightning had spoken softly and kindly
to cissy alton when she spoiled a scene that meant the cutting out of
a hundred and two feet of film at twenty cents a foot the kid
had worked a miracle which was to reach farther than any one could guess

the sorrowful face of george
rogers the perpetually sad
comedian of the international
film companys no i company had
slipped into a sunny smile eight times
in one day after the fourth slip
george became absolutely shameless
and laughed outright the kid had
punched him in the nose with a chubby
red fist

  jimmy hamilton to whom all the
world was an undeveloped picture film
and to whom god had given a double-
edged case-hardened tongue for the
purpose of shooting out verbal light-
ning had spoken softly and kindly to
cissy alton when she spoiled a scene
that meant the cutting out of a hundred
and two feet of film at twenty cents a
foot the kid had tangled his fingers
in jimmys hair and lifted his eyes a full
inch above normal by a powerful pull-
ing of small arms

  ah fling the chinese cook on the
one-hundred-thousand-acre ranch that
the international provided for its great
western motion pictures had escaped
lynching only by the strength of his
kitchen door plus the time and distance
to the next cook ah fling had cooked
a chop suey that would have made the
irish inventor of the dish howl with
envy from the depths of his san fran-
cisco grave ah fling had put all the
knowledge he possessed into that mas-
terpiece and they had discovered him
feeding it to the kid with nimble chop-
sticks the kid had almost succeeded
in gouging out one of the mongolians
eyes

  gracie heyburn an adventuress with
a reputation for heartlessness and de-
ceit wherever there were eyes to look
at films and joe bates whose villain-
ies usually only escaped the board of
censorship by a vote of three to five
the movie makers

were busy making lace bonnets and
square-legged wooden horses the lat-
ter also resembled either an arkansas
river house on flood stilts or a billiard
table the kid had kicked them both

  and polly nelson who was very
young in the business had to unlearn all
the things about her fellow workers
that she had spent six weeks in learn-
ing

  its the limit fling she declared
with much emphasis polly was speak-
ing to the chinese cook polly always
talked to ah fling when she was sorely
troubled or blue he didnt understand
what she was talking about and ac-
cepted all her statements with placid
silence polly found him much better
to talk at than a tree or a rock he
was almost human and he moved
around in a way that was restful to
miss nelsons eyes i say isnt it the
limit fling she repeated theres
george rogers he was supposed to
have all the grouch output in the world
packed away in his cold-storage brain
theres jimmy hamilton that always
had blisters on his lips from the hot
words he let through them gracie ilcy-
burn who can be as catty as anything
when she forgets that her heart begins
beneath her toes and extends to the
end of the longest hair in her head
and joe bates the original cheap-com-
edy slang artist putting the soft pedal
on his awful line of conversation when
little johnnies around for fear he

might learn it and you- oh lord

theyve all got kid-itis its worse than

the limit its- here polly jumped

to her feet with a cry of joyous sur-
prise oo-oo theres the little dar-
ling now

  the book that polly had been reading
before she began talking slipped to the
floor with a bang ah fling leisurely
finished polishing the pan in his hand
and picked it up that was part of the
ranch cooks duties

  polly had seen dorothy carlton the

girl they had found starving and ex-
hausted in the mountains a week before
with the baby hugged to her breast just
as she hugged it now but it was a
different dorothy carlton on this day
the old lines of hunger had disap-
peared under the skill of ah fling the
rings and the hunted look had gone
from her deep blue eyes and the smile
had come back to her lips for all the
members of the internationals no i
company had hearts like polly rogers

 as dorothy carlton came up the
steps of the leading actors headquar-
ters on the ranch her whole face was
alight with some great joy as polly
got out of the door gracie heyburn
hid the unfinished lace bonnet and
jumped to her feet with joe bates and
george rogers who had been match-
ing quarters in a corner some dis-
tance behind dorothy came her hus-
band whose arrival three days before
had made the kid kill the picture that
was to have been the internationals
masterpiece last of all came jimmy
hamilton

  wonderful news cried dorothy
carlton as she reached the top step
simply wonderful

  johnnie hasnt a new tooth  asked
george rogers with one of his new-
found smiles

  he hasnt said something put in
gracie heyburn eagerly

  dorothy carlton smilingly shook her
head then she turned to glance at
her husband and jimmy

  were going to stay she confided
joyfully

  huh blinked joe bates

  sure youre gonna stay george
rogers was bewildered at even the ne-
cessity of such a statement lose the
kid

  jimmy hamilton stopped at i lie lower
step and presented john carlton with
a flourish

  our new juvenile lead he intro-
duced proudly
i 

peoples

  what came the chorus half deep
masculine fifty per cent shrill femi-
nine somehow that possibility had
never occurred to any but the shrewd-
brained jimmy hamilton

  sure repeated the director and
he seemed to be as proud as though he
had conjured some wonderful new be-
ing from nothing

  john carlton shook his head dubi-
ously mr hamilton insists he
was actually blushing i havent had

any experience-

  you dont need it cut in gracie
heyburn quickly some of the best
leads in the business never tried to act
in their lives before they got into this
game look at kildare of the world-
wide company and heres polly nel-
son 

  but i cant act deprecated john
carlton

  if you try ill have you shot at
sunrise put in jimmy hamilton em-
phatically thats why i want you
theres getting to be too blamed much
acting in the films nowadays youve
got the shoulders and the face and you
can keep your feet close to the ground
and brains ejaculated george
rogers entering into the spirit of the
thing

  thatll make him feel strange among
this crowd but hell get over it after a
while jimmy hamilton couldnt for-
get that he was a director after all

  john carlton laughed boyishly
well mr hamilton is taking all the
risk i think it will be wonderfully fine
work and the little lady here and my-
self can be together

  for heavens sake dont call him
mister hamilton growled george
rogers call him jimmy were
using his head now for all the balloon
scenes that come over

  but john carlton paid no attention
he had jumped up the steps two at a
time and held his wife in his arms and
kissed her while the baby tugged man-

fully to separate his right ear from his
head while it laughed in glee at its
defeat

  gee folks wailed jimmy hamil-
ton dont waste that stuff

  laughingly they stood side by side
their arms around each others waists
the child in its fathers arms now
crowing its delight at the world in gen-
eral and the members of the no x com-
pany in particular

  dorothy carlton spoke and her eyes
shone withtears of happiness she could
not hold back youve been so good
to us she murmured so good 
good muttered joe bates in the
stagiest of stage whispers ill bet he
got the best lead team in the country
for about half price

  why defended john carlton in-
stantly hes giving me more than
id earn on fathers railroad in five
years working my way up hes won-
derfully good

  goo crowed little johnnie from
his fathers shoulder goo

 hear that the chorus was a
great shout of wonder and amazement

  just as plain cried gracie hey-
burn good  he said it was jood
that settles it murmured george
rogers in a voice of pretended sorrow
if he says so it must be so the
darned little peach

  instantly they were crowded around
the happy mother and father of the pre-
cocious child that had uttered its first
intelligible word and it was perfectly
intelligible to the leading members of
no i company even if it would require
a little imagination on the part of one
who hadnt seen little johnnie laugh or
felt the pull of his tiny fat fingers out
of the medley of voices jimmy ham-
iltons finally came

  and we can fix up that big picture
too he announced chop off the end
and play it over again itll be even
better

  professionally jimmy hamilton
the movie makers



 knew that it wouldnt for dorothy
 carlton was too happy ever to get that
 same expression on her face again that
 had been there in the one big scene of
 the picture where she had sent her baby
 alone on the mule over the desert to
 find water while she stayed to die
 with her husband the look of suffer-
 ing of resolution the lines of hunger
 that were real in the first picture could
 never be acted the big picture
 couldnt be a masterpiece after all but
 it could be a wonderful production

   perhaps the others all knew this pro-
 fessionally as jimmy hamilton knew it
 but they were all convinced that he was
 perfectly right so the kid hadnt
 killed the big picture after all it
 would be played in a thousand cities

   there you old kill-joy exclaimed
 gracie heyburn triumphantly to george
 rogers george had made that pessi-
 mistic prophecy regarding the kid kill-
 ing the picture for days before it had
 come true

   george pretended not to hear and
 talked very loudly to little johnnie who
 continued to repeat his characterization
 of jimmy hamilton frankly this was
 the opinion of every one on the ranch
 and they would have gone the limit for
 jimmy hamilton any time but profes-
 sional ethics prevented an open state-
  ment to that effect

   the girls finally separated dorothy
 carlton from the men and bore her
 away with johnnie to talk the things
 over the men stayed on the porch
 to wait for cissy alton who had rid-
 den down to the nearest town for the
 papers and mail

  while dorothy was laying johnnie
 on his bed for his afternoon nap polly
 nelson whose unlearning was coming
 hard could keep still no longer

   think of jimmy taking anybody in
 that manner she exclaimed wonder-
 ingly when he hired me he scowled
 and snarled and said i might do but
 jie doubted it

     

  hes in love gracie heyburn ob-
served

  in love polly darted a shocked
glance toward the open door of the
carltons room you dont mean-

  the baby simpleton gracie hey-
burn said almost snappishly then the
reverent softness that polly had never
known till the coming of dorothy carl-
ton came to her voice his own wife
and baby were killed in the quake

  i never knew never suspected
murmured polly as the snappish big-
hearted jollying growling paradox of
a director took a new form in her mind

  jimmys game commented gracie
still in that same low tone as game
as they make em

  dorothy came back then and the
three women chattered away like mag-
pies making plans telling experiences
giving advice while the men on the
porch downstairs did exactly the same
thing only worse

  here comes cissy discovered joe
bates pointing to a distant lust cloud

  plope the crab in new yorks still
got the paresis growled jimmy ham-
ilton rising and stretching his arms up
over his head to get the kinks out of
his brain if he has he may pick out
another good scenario instead of that
flooey-flooey stuff he usually hands us
what we want now is kid stuff with a
kick

  hell probably send us a script that
needs the new york polo grounds and
times square george rogers declared
sourly george was still himself when-
ever the kid was out of sight

  they stood on the porch steps wait-
ing

  hello people people hello called
cissy singsongily when she was within
hailing distance then as she stopped
and let the mail bag drop with a thud
while she rubbed her arm tenderly
you want a ptkx mule for that job
jimmy not a woman with an ingenue
build she spied john carlton and
peoples

  gave him a perk- little nod that was
known from coast to coast better be
careful son she warned that pa of
yours is tearing his hair out by the
roots which is going some for a man
thats as bald as his picture shows
he isnt coming here carlton
asked the question nervously but he ac-
companied it with a squaring of shoul-
ders and setting of chin that brought
a nod of satisfaction from the keen-
eyed jimmy hamilton

  joe bates who had opened the mail
bag and grabbed the first paper an-
swered that question

  by the looks of it he ought to be
in heaven by now he declared this
paper is four days old he was about
nine miles up in the air then and still
going strong

  they crowded around him to read the
big black letters that announced the dis-
appearance of john carlton junior son
of john carlton president of the s f
 g system following the kidnaping
of john carlton third by his mother
the police of every city in the world
were looking for them and the senior
carlton was figuratively frothing at the
mouth

  every city in the world grunted
george rogers that lets us out
youre safe and say son he put his
hand on john carltons shoulder in a
fatherly manner get jimmy to make
a contract for yourself wife and baby
ill guarantee itll take more than pres-
ident carlton railroad king to break it
believe me

  thats the stuff the girls had
hurried down to see the mail and it
was gracie heyburn who put in the
emphatic corroboration

  dorothy had seen the expression on
her husbands face and with a low cry
of fear she ran to him he put his
arms around her and answered the un-
asked question

  its about father dear hes angry
and searching all over for us

 he wont- he ended the trem-
ulous question with his lips the carl-
tons were lovers and didnt care if all
the world knew it no he answered
earnestly were on our own feet
now  and those feet are firmly fixed

 they are-very there was a
queer note in jimmy hamiltons voice
as he stepped up behind the carltons
and made the quiet statement that
caused polly nelson to turn from
gracie heyburn and look at him her
womans eyes saw new lines around the
tight-shut lips there was a look in his
sharp eyes that she couldnt quite define
-then she remembered what gracie
heyburn had told her upstairs his own
wife and child had been killed in the
quake and here was another wife and
child that could be helped a new side
of jimmy hamilton an unsuspected
side but as suddenly as the lines had
come to jimmys face they went and
his voice had all the old-time business
crispness that was softened by a smile
as he finished come on down to the
office and ill fix up those contracts
good scheme george he compli-
mented doubling into his pocket the big
manuscript envelope that held the latest
offerings from the new york office
come on a couple of you for wit-
nesses 

  well all go decided gracie hey-
burn with characteristic leadership
well make it shot-proof and unsink-
able come on folks

  so the procession started toward the
directors office that was in the big
studio building where the interiors
were taken and where the films were
developed they all crowded into the
small littered office and talked as
jimmy wrote the contracts when the
carltons happier than ever at this new
evidence of desire to help signed them
on the proper lines every leading mem-
ber of the no i company affixed their
signatures as witnesses

  itll take more than john carlton
the movie makers

senior ever to break that kind of a pa-
per when i get through with it de-
clared jimmy and polly saw the lines
come again around his mouth and she
thought his words were very grim but
then polly was young in the business
and she hadnt yet learned that all the
imagination to be used had been given
to scenario writers and directors

  now run along children ordered
jimmy as he pulled the manuscript en-
velope from his pocket run along
and pray for paresis if the crabs
sane well never get another decent
picture

  polly wanted to stay behind some-
how she thought he needed a bit of
extra friendliness a word to show that
she understood and sympathized but
already he had turned to his desk his
ivory cutter was ripping at the big en-
velope and over his eyes were the lines
of concentration that came when he
looked at a cold typewritten sheet of
paper and saw moving living charac-
ters live die love and hate men
weighed and found wanting sacrifice
vengeance his mind saw them all be-
tween the cold black lines polly nel-
son stood with her hand on the knob of
the open door as the others walked out
and away toward quarters she looked
at his bent head and hunched shoulders
-shoulders that seemed to droop as
though he were very tired then
something told him of her lingering
he turned and a word of womanly
sympathy was on her lips

  close the door when you go out
polly he said sharply busy

  she choked back the words she
wanted to say with a little catch in her
throat and went out pulling the door
closed after her and leaving him alone
the others were hurrying on ahead but
she made no effort to catch them she
wanted to be alone and to think so
she walked the whole length of the big
studio building around its back and
the length of the other side the happy

members of no i company were too
engrossed with their own affairs even
to miss her she walked to the front
of the building again and looked
through the dusty window of jimmy
hamiltons office she knew that she
could see his face there

  polly hamilton did see his face but
it was not the face of the jimmy ham-
ilton she had known it was drawn
and haggard the chin rested in the cup
of his hands and his eyes stared out
straight before him unseeing unwink-
ing staring into nothing-or into the
face of his dead wife and child per-
haps even as she watched he
shrugged his shoulders as though to
throw off some heavy burden his hands
dropped to the papers before him and
he was jimmy hamiltondirector once
more planning moving pictures on a
hundred-thousand-acre stage

  polly nelson was very quiet that aft-
ernoon or as quiet as she dared to be
in the laughing party without excit-
ing comment it was a regular party
on the big ranch that afternoon and it
included the small-part actors and ac-
tresses from the other big quarters
three miles away the carltons were
the center of attraction that is little
johnnie who had waked from his after-
noon nap was and his proud parents
were content to be the edges or rim
or whatever it is that goes outsidea
center

  at supper time the small-part people
went back to their own quarters and
the leads of no i waited anxiously for
jimmy hamilton to crawl out of his
hole and tell them what was what
when they heard ah fling deftly slide
the big frying pan the length of the
kitchen floor to the open-air kitchen for
the cats supper jimmy came stalking
along

  another flock of floobs growled
joe bates gloomily as he saw the face
of the director

  ill bet the old crab picked up a


peoples

revamped french society drama that
needs a marble fountain and the grave-
yard at monte carlo declared gracie
heyburn with a positiveness that was
based on experience

  when jimmy hamilton reached the
bottom step of the porch he stood for
a minute in a pose which indicated that
the president had died of cholera that
all europe had been swallowed up in
an earthquake or that the price of film
had gone up a quarter of a cent a foot
there was dire earth-sweeping calam-
ity written all over jimmy as he stood
there

  why whats the trouble mr ham-
ilton it was dorothy carlton who
put the question when the gloomy si-
lence had endured for seconds dor-
othy in her innocence didnt know
that with the exception of the day the
big picture had come this same scene
had been enacted for months every
time a batch of scripts came from new
york

  the crab has nipped the paresis in
the bud and hes more normal than
ever much more normal groaned
jimmy i wired him i wanted kid
stuff with a kick he sends me two
scenarios laid in homes for disabled
war veterans a cavalry picture and a
new england romance with every
character being kept out of the grave by
the hundred-year-old death rate also
-he paused impressively-a picture of
two nursemaids and a cop chasing a
baby carriage

  what howled the company mem-
bers in chorus

  why came the shrill protest of
gracie heyburn they stopped that pic-
ture in the spring of 

  huh-uh grunted jimmy then he
smiled widely and wickedly but thats
only a starter old thompson sends
me a nice letter saying theres no hurry
for the pictures the companys going
to devote itself for the next two or

three months to feature stuff featuring
famous men and so forth

  then a real howl went up

  what dye mean feature stuff de-
manded joe bates wrathfully fa-
mous men  why looka me an george
here and carlton

  i told you the crab was more nor-
mal than ever declared jimmy and
there wasnt a sign of a smile now it
isnt such a pleasant thing for a direc-
tor to be told that another director will
produce the first-run films

  i need food after that moaned
cissy alton when the clanging of ah
flings bell broke in on the silence
feature stuff

  they trooped into the dining room
silently sat down silently and then all
began to talk at once as though some
silent signal had been given all were
harpooning old thompson back in new
york except the carltons who sat
dumbly and listened as the meal pro-
ceeded they managed to pick up scraps
of information here and there to get
a glimmering of the storm that had
struck the hundred-thousand-acre
ranch the world-wide film company
had released a lot of feature films that
used the pictures of famous men in
stories written around them the films
were making a bit hit and it was up
to the international to get in line

  there wasnt much chance of corral-
ling famous men  a hundred thousand
acres that had been picked because it
was part prairie part mountain and
part desert so the no  company
would be a number three or four com-
pany while the eastern troupes got in
on the new line

  it was a gloomy finish and a gloomy
after-supper smoke that the men had
while the girls had even a gloomier time
trying to figure out what grace george
was wearing  broadway it got 
little polly nelsons nerves after a
while and she took a sheaf of papers
in a corner and tried to read but her
the movie makers



mind was on the hunched-up staring
man who had been in the rough office
of the studio building-then this new
trouble had come to jimmy hamilton
but polly remembered that snappish
remark when she had waited she knew
that sympathy would not only be wasted
but would be resented so she forced
herself to read naturally the carlton
story interested her she devoured
every line of it and the last two lines
of the very last story she read brought
an exclamation from her lips

  feature stuff she murmured a
big chance

  paper in hand she rose and went out
on the porch as she had become in-
terested in the stories she had taken
no count of time and when she got out
on the porch she was surprised to find
that the girls had gone to bed and that
only jimmy hamilton and joe bates
remained talking over their cigars

  whats the matter with bed little
one called joe bates as she appeared
in the doorway and timmy too looked
up in surprise

  as she stood there a sudden desire
came to polly nelson to give jimmy her
tip when he was alone somehow the
frivolous-tongued joe bates didnt seem
to fit in the picture she had seen through
the window of the directors office so
she answered lightly as she dropped into
a chair

  too fine a night for bed joe think
ill stay up and chat a while

  it was half an hour later when pollys
impatience had almost become rage that
joe yawned and announced that he
was going to bed for several min-
utes after he went there was silence on
the moon-lit porch and it was jimmy
hamilton who broke it

  raise polly he asked quietly
turning his head to look at her

  no jimmy youre more than fair
pollys voice too was quiet its
about that feature stuff she saw his
eyes narrow as she held up the paper

she had folded under her arm two
lines here look like a big chance for us
president carlton is going to inspect his
s f  g system this week paying
particular attention to the operation of
small way stations that coop of a
place down at the southeast corner of
the ranch is one of those way stations

  he almost snatched the paper from
her hands and there was a strange
hardness in his voice as he said lets
see that polly hadnt an idea that the
thing had hit him so hard she didnt
suspect that anything could he took
the paper to the porch rail and by the
light of the moon read the lines she
had pointed out read them with his
eyes narrowed and lips set thank
god he muttered as his eyes had cor-
roborated pollys statement then he
turned to meet her curious stare she
saw that lie was on the verge of saying
something but that he changed his mind
suddenly

  cant overlook that bet polly he
declared with characteristic brusque-
ness jamming the paper in his pocket
always knew that some day id have
a chance to write a scenario of my own
the way i wanted it this is it ill
write one around carlton itll be a
peach too get to bed now ive got
to work

  he nodded jerkily and hurrying
down the steps started in the direction
of his office polly watched him go as
far as she could see him in the bright
light of the moon then she turned to
the door with a sob that caught in her
throat a sob of sympathy and under-
standing she obeyed jimmys order
but she tossed restlessly on her bed
sleep would not come after hours of
tossing she rose and looked out of her
window the light in the window of
jimmys office burned brightly he was
working on the scenario what kind of
a scenario would it be-the story of
john carlton junior of his wife and
baby she shook her head it couldnt
peoples

be that jimmy wouldnt dare make a
film out of that and with john carl-
ton senior appearing personally fea-
ture stuff must always make a hero of
the feature dawn came the light
still burned in the office window

  at the breakfast table polly heavy-
eyed saw that he showed no signs of
his all night at work he even smiled
cheerfully though in a low-toned aside
to her he cautioned silence she under-
stood that he did not want the carltons
to know that there was a possibility of
the elder carlton coming

  got a fair picture announced
jimmy when he liad demanded a third
cup of coffee called outcasts rich
girl marries a poor fellow her father
casts her off by jove he had appar-
ently just got a new thought he stared
at the carltons why cant we put
in a scene with a baby like dorothy was
when the girls found her only adding
an unconscious husband or better yet
have dorothy and the baby just as they
were and have the husband who was
out searching for food come back and
find them he gazed around at them
with shining eyes

  polly drew in her breath sharply
was he going to work john carlton
senior into that picture he wouldnt
dare she looked around the table but
jimmys enthusiasm was contagious

  great cried gracie heyburn

  big-time stuff with a punch as-
severated joe bates

  even the carltons who had caught
the atmosphere of the big ranch in the
week they had been together on it ac-
cepted the idea joyously they too
had come to see only pictures and the
making of films as the days work
they had come to sense a situation

  fine they chorused

  and you know little johnnie gets a
hundred for every picture he gets in
jimmy hamilton smiled theres two
hundred to his credit now that des-
ert stuff drew a bonus

  the thanks of the carltons were al-
most pathetic and for the instant that
all the others attention was on dor-
othy and her husband polly again
thought she saw the tight little lines
around jimmy hamiltons mouth but
they were gone again instantly and she
thought she must have been mistaken

  you can have another day off de-
clared jimmy when they rose from the
table pm going to look over the
ground for sets to-day and to-morrow
well start in

  immediately the no i members be-
gan planning an all-day picnic there
were very few days when one or more
of them didnt work polly nelson took
no interest in the plans her mind was
somewhere else when she got an op-
portunity she strolled out on the big
porch in time to see jimmy in his auto-
mobile scoot off in the direction of the
railroad tracks and the small telegraph
way station

  her brow puckered in puzzlement
there was something on jimmy ham-
iltons mind that no picture had ever
put there before was he going to risk
his position merely for a chance to get
a feature on president carlton  but
her mind refused to entertain it
jimmy was square he was hurt and
justly so at his relegation to second or
third place by the officials of the com-
pany but he still had bis common sense
to tell him what the pictures of presi-
dent carlton on a moving-picture film
would mean of course if it could go
through it would make the younger
carltons known all over the country
and the baby a household word the
baby to her mind again flashed that
picture of the hunched-up man at the
desk whose eyes apparently stared at
nothing would he sacrifice everything
to put the carltons on the road to fame
and money for the sake of the mother
and child-and the memory of a mother
and child that had been taken away
from him
the movie makers



  they bore polly away to the picnic
then but all through the day her mind
was on jimmy hamilton and the pic-
ture he had spoken of there was no
suspicion in the minds of the other
players no suspicion because jimmy
had failed to mention outcasts when
he had spoken of the batch of scripts
that had come from new york it
was a fair picture jimmy had said
and that was all that concerned any of
them

  that night polly got jimmy aside
and asked the question and he an-
swered it with a slow shake of his head
and it seemed a long while after when
the words came

  no polly he said quietly it
isnt their story polly raised her eyes
quickly to peer into his for she had de-
tected a shade of peculiar emphasis on
the their but his eyes met hers
steadily with no flicker of expression
to tell what he had meant or whether
she had been right after all

  the next day began the work of the
new picture once more dorothy carl-
ton proved that she was a natural mo-
tion-picture actress just as two or three
other women have proved it to skep-
tical film directors throughout the coun-
try for several of the best leading mo-
tion-picture actors and actresses never
had any experience on the stage

  but it wasnt all natural acting in
dorothys case once more the clever
jimmy hamilton had given her a part
that she had really lived that she knew
in life and in great acting the heart
is the prompter for expression and
through the early scenes of outcasts
dorothy carltons face only had to obey
the dictates of her heart that had
learned so bitter a lesson john carl-
ton needed experience and needed it
badly he was stiff and constrained
unaccustomed to playing parts before
the clicking camera that would show
him on the films in a thousand cities
his wifes work carried him through

the first scenes and as time went on
lifted him out of himself just as it had
lifted other actors out of themselves in
the big picture

  in the first two days of rehearsing
and playing polly nelson saw nothing
remarkable in the scenes of the scenario
jimmy hamilton had written they
were commonplace enough and she
saw that jimmy was breaking the se-
quence of the scenes even more than
location and setting of the various parts
of the ranch required moreover his
usual snappy haste was missing the
work went through in a leisurely man-
ner and would have made the jimmy
hamilton that polly had known throw
all the seven fits of rage

  on the third day the mail was due at
the town and polly volunteered to go
after it her young brain was sorely
puzzled and she wanted quiet to
straighten out its kinks she rode
slowly there was no hurry and tried
to figure out in her mind the feature
stuff that jimmy hamilton was holding
back for something was in the back
of his shrewd head she knew it
every time he looked at dorothy carl-
ton or john or the baby polly sur-
prised that curious look in his eyes a
look that polly could not fathom

  she rode down toward the tracks
through the natural amphitheater two
small hills made through the narrow
gorge that had been the scene of a hun-
dred moving-picture holdups because
it curved sharply and hid from view
anything that might be coming down it
and also the railroad tracks a few hun-
dred feet farther on she always went
that way because she always had a few
words with the hopeless old derelict
who watched over the way station and
the telegraph key

  she didnt have to hail him this time
he was standing out on the rotten-
boarded platform and began to talk as
soon as she got within sight

  heres a telegraft that just came fer

at		


peoples

mister hamilton by the time he had
finished that sentence polly had
brought her galloping pony to a dust-
raising stop beside him the owl man
will be here about half past two in
the afternoon to-morra he volun-
teered with no thought of breaking
state and national laws regarding the
sanctity of telegrams

  the old man  puzzled polly
thrusting the envelope into the bosom
of her waist

  sure the prisident owld carl-
ton

  to-morrow gasped polly of
course she had known that he was com-
ing but the shock of explicit informa-
tion and the nearness of the crisis took
her by surprise

  certainy  the aged telegrapher
who sought peace and quiet in loneli-
ness winked up at her with owlish
wisdom dont be tryin to fool me
didnt mister hamilton wire him
tother day that his son and daughter-
in-law and baby was all here

  he did that the words came
faintly from pollys lips and she sud-
denly felt numb all over as her whole
world turned topsy-turvy jimmy ham-
ilton had told carlton senior where
the young carltons had hidden them-
selves jimmy hamilton had played
the traitor

 funny-

  ive got to hurry she choked and
she dug her spurs into the ponys flanks
while he stared after her

  the ride to town was the longest
polly nelson had ever made jimmy
hamilton a traitor to the people he was
pretending to help but it couldnt be
possible-the picture there at the desk
then she remembered the eye narrow-
ings the grim lines around the direc-
tors mouth the curious looks she had
surprised in his eyes whenever they
were turned on the carltons so it
hadnt been all imagination it had
been true but why why why

  she took the mail bag without both-
ering to answer the greetings as usual
and galloped full speed back toward the
ranch she went the way she had
come for she wanted to speak again
with the old telegraph operator why
had she gone away so quickly  he had
been about to say something else per-
haps shed a different light on the thing
polly nelson didnt want to think that
jimmy hamilton was anything but the
man she had respected for so many
weeks the man who had shown a new
and wonderfully human side in the last
few days

  but she had no chance to speak with
the old man she saw jimmy ham-
iltons car and she saw him and one
of the ranchs moving-picture-machine
men carefully looking over the ground
around the station he saw her com-
ing and walked rapidly toward her

  obrien give you a message for
me he asked curtly

  polly handed it to him but her eyes
were looking down at the pommel of
her saddle and her lips were tightly
compressed

  told you all about it i suppose
he said ripping the flap open

  she looked up then oh jimmy
she cried how could you

  picture he said sternly and his
eyes commanded her eyes to meet his
my picture he said and on that first
word was the same peculiar emphasis
she had noticed in a word he had used
once before some of the sternness
went out of his voice and he rested a
hand on her horses neck as he went
on isnt it better to have it over
now than always to have the suspense
polly his voice became almost gen-
tle you know how the contracts are
he cant get any of them away

  it was her eyes that forced his to
drop when he saw that she read them
i suppose the picture is the whole
thing she said colorlessly nothing
seems to matter so long as the picture
the movie makers



is good perhaps its because im young
in the game and it isnt all of me yet
as it is with the rest of you perhaps
i havent had time to get your view-
point but it seems to me that there are
other and greater things in the world
than moving pictures i may be wrong
but theres things in this world that
dont seem worth the price somehow
and this is one of them but it is
vour picture i know nothing good-
by 

  she swerved her pony to avoid run-
ning over him and galloped away the
picture that was everything the
picture it seemed to polly nelson
that she had heard nothing else since
she went into the business that was
the god of gods the deity of empy-
rean dont spoil the film had been
dinned into her ears as the greatest of
all laws she had thought it had be-
come part of her too that demand for
the picture

  in the narrow gorge she saw another
camera man scrambling up the steep
sides another part of the picture
a small part that had to be made per-
fect so that the whole might bring
nickels and dimes to the coffers of mo-
tion-picture theaters the picture
no price was too great to pay for a
good picture hadnt she heard that
over and over hadnt she marveled
at the nerve of men who risked their
lives a dozen times a day for a hundred
feet of film no price not even self-
respect honor for jimmy hamil-
ton was about to sacrifice both for a
few hundred feet of film

  somehow she forced a smile on her
lips and a cheery word of greeting when
she arrived at quarters but she pleaded
a headache and skipped the supper
table and its chatter she wanted to
lie on her bed and think it over but
nature stepped in and demanded its toll
for the hours of sleep she had lost the
night before

  the ringing of ah flings breakfast

bell waked her with a start and she
hurried downstairs to find jimmy
hamilton his old-time hustling self

  well get a wiggle on to-day folks
he announced well clean up the
ranch end

  is there another end cried cissy
alton joyfully

  sure grinned jimmy but he didnt
look at polly as she joined the group
got to leave the fathers city home
and come back to it you know come
on fling cram it all in one reel now
the breakfast table was a short and
merry party every one was elated at
the prospect of a trip to the city and
polly noticed how deftly jimmy kept
the conversation away from the carl-
tons and the risks they would run in
going to a city there he showed his
directorship as never before every
minute of the morning was crammed
with work but after lunch jimmy
seemed to take more time

  they had all gone down to the little
amphitheater near the railroad only
polly knew why and she alone could
anticipate the coming of president carl-
ton at half past two in his special that
would be hidden by the small hill to
the right that formed part of the gorge
the president himself would remain
hidden till he burst unexpectedly upon
them

  jimmy hamilton was telling the
carltons their story

  youve lived a year and a half in
your small mountain cabin and the
child has come youve got to get down
among people and stop living like ani-
mals the husband gets a job on the
ranch joe fix that face of yours so
youll look like new york thinks a
ranch foreman ought to look you sit
over there on that rock with the baby
dorothy and watch anxiously you
people get back and stay back  all
over this side i want that gorge to
show as a background shoot tommy 
the machine began to click and far


peoples

up in the hills pollys strained ears
heard the first toot of a train whistle
it was all being timed timed well for
the picture

  rut jimmy hamilton kept talking at
breakneck speed

  dont walk so straight john
slouch you helped carry that kid
twenty miles over the mountains
youre tired come on joe takeoff
your hat drag it down over your nose
john dont lift it like they do on mar-
ket street scowl joe scrape your
feet john

  so the directions went on tersely
crisply telling each move putting each
character on record polly in the group
of watchers outside the camera range
listened in vain for another toot of the
engine but she heard the rumble of
the train back of the hill no one else
seemed to hear it for they were all in-
tent on jimmy and the picture that was
being played

  now we jump ahead twenty scenes
had most of the ones in between this
morning the foreman accuses you of
cattle rustling john walk left and
on stand watching joe come on
john meet dont slouch now
straighten up and tell him hes a liar
beat him to his gun right

  polly watching jimmy hamilton
with the eyes of a hawk saw him glance
at the top of the hill on the left she
saw a white handkerchief wave that
was a signal for what

  back away joe thats it come
on dorothy youve seen it from the
hill and you want to know whats the
matter thats it face the camera
a bit more

  then polly nelson saw from the
mouth of the narrow gorge came presi-
dent carlton panting blowing alone

get back joe ordered jimmy and
his voice kept all other eyes on himself
and the camera all others but pollys
turn the other way you two quick
like automatons obeying the voice

they had learned to obey dorothy carl-
ton her baby in her arms and john
turned to face his father

  with a cry the girl shrank back and
her cry was echoed by all of the actors
who had been spellbound by the sound
of jimmys voice

  president carlton raised his hand in
a gesture of anger you he cried
and there was accusation in his voice
you

  with a low moan that wrung pollys
heart dorothy hamilton clasped the
baby tighter to her breast and trembled
in fear her husband too had fallen
back a step numbed by the shock of it
all

  come with me all the authority
over ten thousand men on his railroad
system was in president carltons voice
as he made that demand of his son
he stretched forth a hand to grasp him
by the arm

  tell him to go to the devil john
jimmy hamiltons crisp voice broke in
the tone as it always was when he is-
sued a direction john carlton junior
accustomed to obey instantly that voice
and tone straightened his shoulders
stand close to him john right
now back put your arms around your
wifes waist

  perhaps both their brains were in-
capable of thinking for themselves but
they obeyed that voice unquestioningly
president carlton turned his head once
then ignored the group his son must
come home with him

  tell him youre going to stick to the
little woman and the child john tell
him throw it into him cling to
johns arm dorothy

  then john junior found his tongue
found it and used it like a man there
was no disrespect nothing but straight-
from-the-shoulder talk president carl-
ton tried to interrupt in his wrath his
face black scowling an unpleasant
thing to look at dorothy carlton clung
to her husbands arm and spoke soft
the movie makers



words to the child in her arms that had
already begun to whimper in fear

  the other members of company no
i held their breaths as they watched
that first curt order of jimmy hamil-
ton had made them hear for the first
time the steady click of the camera
crank they understood and held their
breaths lest they spoil it feature stuff
feature stuff and a side of presi-
dent carlton philanthropist distribu-
tor of charity that the world had never
seen feature stuff was what new
york wanted eh well here it was
hot off the bat and sizzling

  jimmys voice broke in again now
step in and order him off the ranch
joe

  joe bates took his cue instantly
president carlton whirled from his son
get out snapped joe bates and
there was no acting in his manner or
voice it was just plain anger get
his hand dropped to his revolver an
unloaded weapon that wouldnt shoot
anyway and was therefore safe but
president carlton didnt know that

  he backed away a step and his face

went white what-what- he

spluttered

  out snapped joe

  john carlton junior still in his daze
stepped forward protestingly

  step back ordered jimmy hamil-
ton wrathfully and john did it before
he thought

  joe bates gun slowly withdrew from
the holster president carlton snarled
something then turned and stalked back
the way he had come

  thats all tommy jerked jimmy
hamilton and the clicking machine
stopped jimmy jumped forward and
he raised his voice i want to speak
to you carlton

  there was something in the direc-
tors voice then that made polly nelson
shudder the big railroad president
turned and jimmy hamilton reached
him in two steps

  youve done a good days work
carlton he said and there was that
same note in his voice a note half men-
ace half sneer all danger see that
machine there he pointed a long
arm you were too full of your own
wrath to see or hear it werent you 
know what it is its a motion-pic-
ture camera and every snarl every
sneer every nasty expression that
showed on your face will show on a
thousand screens next week see down
the gulch there a camera caught you
coming through notice that pile of
boxes down by the station another
camera caught your train and you
alighting theyre howling for feature
stuff back east carlton and i guess
perhaps a couple of our news-interest
camera men caught you in frisco and
on the way i wired them to and
its all going in a picture carlton a
peach of a picture a feature its
going to show the world the real carl-
ton the dirty kind of a dog thatd put
a woman out to starve in the mountains
with a baby and the camera cant lie
carlton  people know it cant lie

  no one on the one-hundred-thousand-
acre international ranch had ever seen
a look on the face of jimmy hamilton
like the one that was there when he
finished that last biting sentence polly
nelson clenched her hands at her sides
and she knew that the pain of the nails
in her palms was the only thing that
kept her from fainting the others
were silent rigid aware that they were
not seeing play now dorothy carlton
hugged her baby tight crooning to it
to quiet its fears for there was nothing
else in her world just then her hus-
band was of stone incapable of move-
ment

  the gamut of human emotion seemed
to have crossed president carltons face
in a few seconds and then his lips
curved in a sneering smile he was
himself again

  so thats it he said quietly but


peoples

there was threat in the quiet black-
mail eh

  the words that came from jimmy
hamiltons lips then seemed to shake
his whole body no it isnt black-
mail carlton jimmys voice was
hoarse low so they had to strain their
ears to catch the words ill tell you
the rest of this moving-picture story
its called outcasts the husband and
wife and baby go back to the city with
the hope of reconciliation they go to
a hotel carlton a fine-looking strong-
looking hotel that was built by a rail-
road that bribed building contractors
and building inspectors and city offi-
cials till it was only a shell and a death
trap carlton and the husband goes
out to see his father leaving the wife
to watch over their sleeping baby then
he comes back to find that the hotel has
collapsed that a hundred men are dig-
ging digging and that somewhere un-
der a thousand tons of rotten brick and
mortar and iron his wife and baby are
dead

  the fires of hell itself could not have
blazed higher than president carltons
anger then damn you  he screamed
if you put that in ill kill you by
the living god ill kill you

  then a sneering smile came to the
lips of jimmy hamilton the same kind
that had rested on carltons lips a min-
ute before your lying papers and
your whitewashing investigators have
made people almost forget that hotel
havent they carlton  but they havent
made me forget it the thing was in-
side of the quake zone wasnt it but
other buildings that had been there for
years before the hotel was dreamed of
stood didnt they but the hotel you
built collapsed like a pack of cards
carlton like a death pack of cards
and i joined the diggers carlton and
i worked till they carried me off to the
hospital but i didnt find my wife
and baby carlton they were under-
neath it all they never found them-

not my wife and baby-you know what
they did find when they lifted the tons
from frail bones and flesh dont you
carlton and the whole damn worlds
going to see it no it isnt blackmail
vengeance carlton a twentieth-cen-
tury brand a truth in celluloid and the
people that see that picture wont for-
get it nor you

  he stopped for sheer lack of breath
to look at the man before him presi-
dent carlton seemed to have shrunk in
his clothes his face white and his
hands shielded his eyes as though to
shut out some hideous picture

  that pictures going to bring it all
back carlton jimmy hamilton went
on ruthlessly its hell now isnt it
even after these few years but youd
almost forgotten hadnt you and
now its going to live live live damn
you but youll pay i took your sen

im going to keep them here for i want
the boy to grow up clean and white
with people that are white he couldnt
be that with you and your rotten rail-
road offices could he and my wife

looked like dorothy and my baby-

  an arm laid gently on his sleeve
stopped him and he turned to see dor-
othy carlton looking up into his face
with eyes that were filled with tears

  dont she begged please dont
see hes suffered enough please
dont do it youve been so good so
good you wont make us suffer now
be the good jimmy hamilton thats
done so much

  suffered cried jimmy bitterly

suffered  why great-

  he stopped again two tiny hands
clasped his shoulders two great wise
eyes looked up into his

goo cooed little johnnie goo
see jimmy see he found polly
nelson on the other side of him her
hand lightly touching his arm her face
with all its piquant charm upraised
oh jimmy she sobbed quietly
the movie makers



there are bigger things in the world
than pictures bigger finer things

  he looked away from her eyes he
saw the baby hands fondling the lapel
of a coat worn by an old old man
whose trembling fingers touched doro-
thy carltons arm and blindly sought
to draw her to him

  bigger things he muttered yes
bigger things than the picture

  it seemed minutes that he stood there
face haggard drawn the fight inside
of him putting new lines on his face
every instant he was fighting the only
world that he knew was jimmy hamil-
ton he turned away from them
sharply brusquely and walked to the
camera with steady fingers he
opened it took out the reel and the
sunlight ruined a thousand feet of film

conahan

by larry evans

something was scratching at the packed snow in the doorframe something
whined and when i loosened the door and the wind blew it open the thing
staggered into the room it was a dog msieur-a dog half dead and more with
fatigue his shaggy yellow coat crusted with sleet and his feet cut and bleeding

the log fire on the hearth of
father le fevres cabin had all
but burned to embers the room
was warm for the chinks were tight
but the wind outside whining down
from the north pounded the panes with
crystals that were fined and frost-tem-
pered and sharp as needle points and
the glass that hung on the doorframe
stood a shade under fifty below zero

  it was a night like this white and
deadly cold father le fevre was
staring into the fire again and talking
so softly that i could scarcely catch the
words-merely thinking aloud

  we were sitting here in the cabin
conahan and i just that day he had
come down from the lumber camp
twenty miles upriver lean and hard
in his scarlet mackinaw and high moc-
casins from months in the timber we
had been talking but little and were
just sitting quiet glad of the fire when
we heard it that night-heard a cry
come down the wind as you heard a
moment ago the wind in the treetops

  it brought me to my feet that night

-lifted me from my chair in one spring
-and i stood staring into conahans
face with a question in my eyes he
had merely lifted his head but for all
that he was straining his ears to catch
a repetition of that sound a minute
maybe two we waited and all we heard
was the droning beat of the storm on
the windows conahan scratched a
match and held it to the bowl of his
pipe

   tis the wind father he said
 tis just the wind howlin its devils
song in the br-ranches

   it sounded like a womans voice
i answered him it sounded like a
woman calling

  conahan only nodded and leaned
back he was thinking of something
else but i was not convinced and he
was still straining to hear maybe that
was the reason i was the first at the
latch pin and the first to throw open
the door minutes later when another
sound brought us both up standing

  something was scratching at the
packed snow in the doorframe some-


peoples

thing whined and when i loosened the
door and the wind blew it open the
thing staggered into the room it was
a dog msieur-a dog half dead and
more with fatigue his shaggy yellow
coat crusted with sleet and his feet cut
and bleeding a collar hung about his
neck the heavy padded collar of the
sledge harness and on either side of
him the ends of the traces dragged in
the snow but he wasnt the usual
sledge dog of the north not a half-
breed wolf for the sheep-dog blood
was plain to be seen in his sharp nose
and close-laid ears-oui and in the
eyes of him too

  he lurched across the threshold
when the door flew open and stood
swaying back and forth his feet out-
spread to hold him steady and gazed
up at us-gazed and lifted his nose and
whined softly i put my weight against
the door to force it shut and when the
latch fell he whirled that broken half-
dead animal and tore with his bleeding
feet at the doorsill and barked shrilly

  conahan dropped to his knees be-
side him

   shteady lad shteady time
enough yet lad he coaxed and then
to me youll be afther boldin the
light father and quicklike man for
im thinking this is a matter av min-
utes 

  i turned and took the light from the
table and squatted beside him cona-
han had the ends of the flat leather
traces in his hands and for an instant
he examined them with the dog whim-
pering madly and trying to lick his
face then he flung them from him and
leaped erect

   theyre fresh cut-the tr-races he
cried fr-resh cut and clean-cut too
with a knife that had an edge to the
steel av it somebody when theyd
no longer the strength to fight fur-rther
somewhere out there in the dar-rk
turned the lead dog loose they must
be close for the fr-resh leathers sthill

dry as tinder-and im thinkin father
the dog will be takin me to them

  he whirled toward where his cap
and gloves lay steaming before the
fire and the dog reading all that he
meant to do turned and flung his spent
body against the closed door and whim-
pered madly for haste

   aye bhoy im cornin conahan
cried down lad youll be needin
your str-rength-if tis not too late al-
ready no father tis better you wait
build up the fire and heat a drop av
br-randy im thinkin itll be but a
minute ill be gone

  he went out the dog leaping before
him i saw him bend to the gale
flounder in the soft snow heard his
voice drift back hoarsely and then the
storm swallowed him up but he had
read well the signs and he did not have
far to go just yonder across the river
where the old trail from the north-
west country cuts into the main sled
road he found them-he found a sledge
already half banked over by the driving
wind and the played-out dog team bur-
rowed in the lee of a drift

  and he found more than that face
down in the sugary snow there lay a
figure-a figure slim and boyish in its
furs and hooded parka-limp and
asprawl with the snowshoes that were
bound to its moccasined feet at an ugly
angle there was a knife in one out-
stretched mittened hand-the knife that
had cut the lead dog loose with that
same blade conahan cut away the tan-
gled snowshoes and slit the rest of the
broken dog team out of harness

  i heard him coming back i had
built up the fire when i heard the yap-
ping of the dog and when i threw open
the door conahan staggered in with
that slim figure limp over one shoulder
dragging with the other hand the low
long sledge of all the things i re-
member of that night i remember
most vividly i think how he swore
hoarsely when the sledge caught in
conahan



the doorway and hindered his haste
there was a man on that sledge buried
deep in the robes his head resting on a
small canvas-lashed pack at the for-
ward end as swiftly as i could i shut
out the storm and dropping to my
knees lifted the corner of the blanket
that covered his face i-i do not
know how long i stared not long no
doubt but i saw much in that one
instant

  his skin was the color of ivory-
as white and set nor was there any
need to feel for the beat of his heart
he was dead and he had died horribly
that man had in his wide staring eyes
and twisted lips there was something
that i never want to see again in any
face why he had gone across mock-
ing at life itself

 i drew back the corner of the
blanket to hide it and half rose-rose
and turned and stopped and stared
msieur there before my bunk his back
to the fire conahan had halted and
he too was staring-staring as though
he would never see anything else into
the face of that boyish figure that lay
in the hollow of his arm

  the heavy parka hood had fallen
back and down over conahans red
sleeve there poured a mass of hair
swaying almost to his knees it was
thick-thick and heavy and rippling-
and it quivered under the firelight like
a thing of life the color of raw gold
and-and there stood conahan staring
into her face staring as though he
would never believe his eyes i heard
his breath come and go come and go-
so through his teeth then he turned
and spoke in a voice i had never heard
pass his lips before

   mither av god he breathed aloud
men before now have prayed with half
the awe there was in his words that
night mither av god  he said and
then lifted his eyes to mine

   father look ye he whispered

 tis a woman-tis just a bit av a
gir-rl

  out it was she-she who had cried
out to us in the storm do you won-
der msieur that i start up even now
when i hear the scream of the wind in
the trees-and that was years and years
back 

  there is no need for me to tell you
to-night how conahan fought that
night through to fan back into a blaze
the one small spark of life that the wind
could not beat out of her body isnt
it enough to say that somehow he did
it now pouring warm brandy between
her bloodless lips now rubbing with
dry snow her ankles chalky white
where he had cut away the frozen
leather of the moccasins alone
quietly without a spoken word he
drove back the cold that was creeping
in upon her heart and the only sound
in this cabin that night was the hiss of
his breath as he labored she lived
msieur she lived simply because cona-
han kneeling beside her shut his teeth
and would not let her die i know for
did i not see with my own eyes

  just once not long before dawn
conahan looked up at me as i stood
holding a fresh bucket of dry snow
and seemed to see me there for the first
time a question flared in his eyes
as he jerked his head toward the body
that lay quiet behind him on the sledge
i could only shake my head in answer
and he understood

  then if ther-res annything that
you can do father he suggested
youll be earin a bit for that dog

  that girl lived msieur-out i had
said that before she lived and when
the wind went down with a rising sun
her eyes opened for the first time and
glanced only half sanely about the
room but at that instant the dog lying
before the fire whimpered and snarled
in his sleep she heard and comprehen-
sion flooded her face she half lifted
herself and tried to stretch out her arm


peoples

  jock good old boy jock she
called barely above a whisper but he
heard for all that for he rose and
whined and tottered across to tuck his
nose beneath her arm

  and then msieur that girl did a
strange thing minute after minute she
lay there in the blankets herwhite face
half buried in that thick hair of hers
and looked up into conahans face she
lay and looked and looked eyes wide
and lips parted until at last she reached
out one small hand and put it almost
timidly upon his scarlet sleeve

   you are real she stated quaver-
ingly youre real-and so we must
have made it i knew i was still sane
   out there i knew i saw your
light

  she tried to smile

   im hungry she told him falter-
ingly-oui as simply as that im very
-very-hungry she told him and
with that she slipped off to sleep

  i wish you could have seen the face
of conahan as i saw it there that
night

  father le fevres voice hushed for
a moment then his head lifted and he
looked into my face for the first time
since the beginning of the story

  msieur he asked msieur have
you ever thought that you knew a man
-knew him well i mean-almost as
well as you knew yourself and then
waked to the fact that you knew him
not at all it is a strange sensation
non well it was in the week that fol-
lowed the coming of that yellow-haired
girl to singing river that i first real-
ized that corjahan-whom i had known
year in and year out longer than i
could remember-was a total stranger
to me why i found that i knew him
only as he was known to other men
the whole river length for the strength
of his shoulders and the weight of his
fist

  conahan did not go back to the
camp upriver that week the first day

after the storm i moved what things
i needed across to his shack and dou-
bled up with him so that she need not
be disturbed and the afternoon of
that same day we drew the sledge with
the quiet form beneath the blanket out-
side the cabin

  you would hardly believe that any
human being who had been so near the
end as that slim girl had been could
come back again so quickly the vital-
ity of the dog she called jock was no
less than her own and after he had
slept the night through and eaten raven-
ously in the morning there was little
or nothing to show what he had been
through except that he limped a little
on his cut pads and whimpered once
or twice with pain as he followed con-
ahan wherever he went

  she came back with all the vitality
of her youthful body msieur yet not
once during that first day did she ask
for the man whom conahan had found
with her on the trail below the dam
or speak of the night before or of the
storm save to ask quietly that conahan
would care for the dog team and
she lay quiet on the bunk and watched
without a word or a quiver of her face
while we dragged the sledge outside
but she understood quickly enough
when conahan turned back to her his
cap in hand and waited for her to
speak

   he died on the trail days before
you found us she told him slowly i
-i cannot remember just how long
back but he was dead the second day
of the storm

  not a shadow of emotion or a hint
of pity colored her voice or marked
her face her eyes only narrowed a
little-narrowed and hardened-and
her lips straightened into a line that
made me remember even more vividly
the twisted lips of the face beneath
the blanket and then she asked us to
leave for her just that small canvas-
lashed bundle upon which his head had
conahan



been lying conahan put it beside the
bunk and we buried the dead man that
same afternoon

  conahan spoke scarcely a word
while we laid him yonder under the
pines where he has lain quiet since
but he stared a long time into that
white face with its broad forehead and
twisted mocking lips he stared a
long time not with the horrified fas-
cination that had held me but with
preoccupied gravity that i did not quite
understand i looked no longer than i
could help for it was not nice to see

  then he marked the mound and
went without a word back to my cabin
to sit at the side of that girl whose
hair lay shimmering like gold fanwise
on her pillow but that night when
jean coteaus wife had come to care
for her conahan crossed to our shack
and after we had eaten leaped back
to the subject as was his custom with-
out preface or introduction

   theyd come far he said half to
himself theyd been close to two
weeks or maybe more on the tr-rail
for there was no food left on the
sledge nor even a scr-rap av meat for
the dogs and they did not know anny
too well the counthry im thinkin for
tis years and more since anny man
has tr-raveled that tr-rail to come down
from the nor-rthwest

  he sat ramming tobacco into the
bowl of his pipe with a slow forefinger
and shook his head at my question

   shes slept the whole afthernoon
long shes scar-rce spoken at all im
thinkin shell never speak-av him
that is why twas her father man
twas her own father could you not
be afther readin that just fr-rom the
face av him  shes that mans daugh-
ter-and father shes glad-shes only
mighty mighty glad hes dead

  conahan was silent for an instant
his voice had been oddly gentle now
it became suddenly harsh and grating

     

   ther-res manny like him he went
on too manny like him here in the
nor-rth with the for-rehead av a god
and the evil lips av hell itself fr-rom
where do they come theyre just the
men fr-rom over yonder theyre the
men who cant go back and twas
her own father for shes his str-raight
nose and wide-set eyes thank god
shes not his lips-nor heart nor
br-rain im thinkin and shes glad
-shell sleep the sounder now for
knovvin that mans dead

  msieur i would like to picture her
for you if i believed i could do it well
i would like to tell you of her wide
grave gray eyes and little pointed chin
and her lips that always seemed to smile
so readily but after all is there any
need it is only how conahan saw
her that counts and as that first week
passed i realized day by day-oui
hour by hour-that conahan would
never see the face of any woman in
the world save hers

  i pitied him can you quite con-
ceive the conceit of it of my pitying
conahan whose brain more than
matched my own and whose body-but
i have already told you the man he
was and yet i did just that thing
each time i remembered the light in
his eyes as he stood that first night
staring into her smooth face with her
hair heavy as spun gold on his sleeve
each time i remembered the slim wrists
and ankles of her i grew more and
more sorry for him

  for a blind man could scarcely have
mistaken the thing that was in her fea-
tures and the features of that man
who lay silent under the snow for all
the evil that masked it you and i
too for want of a better word call it
breeding and yet i was myself blind
id looked on conahan year in and
year out too blind to see the man he
really was now i often wish i could
only have known what blood it was
that ran in that mans veins


peoples

  day after day strength came back
to that slender girl who lay in my cabin
until except for her frost-touched feet
that would be useless still for days one
would never have guessed how near the
end she had been conahan housed the
dog team that week and cared for them
and the rest of the time from sunup
till dusk he spent beside her bunk or
doing errands for her

  often as i passed or hesitated at
the door i wondered of what they
talked for she never spoke of whence
she came or of what she might have
been yet hour after hour id hear
her light treble or his heavy bass

  each day was like that until one
evening at the end of the week i went
back to our shack to find conahan al-
ready there before me he hardly no-
ticed my entrance that night-he barely
looked up at all-and i stood and gazed
a long time before i realized what he
was doing msieur he had her little
suit of furred boys clothing spread
out on the table in front of him and
was bent double above it measuring
seam for seam and jotting down the
figures with a bit of pencil once in a
while he would speak aloud to himself
i never saw a face more set or earnest

  he took the trail that night-the
trail to beckett-and before the fol-
lowing midday he was back again even
his straight back bent a little under the
weight of his loaded pack basket
everything that that girl might be able
to use-every conceivable thing that he
could get for her-he had brought for
her from beckett

  he could have driven for the sled
road was once more smooth as glass
under the hauling it was like him to
want to bring back that pack upon his
own shoulders yet for all that his
face was more than dissatisfied when
he entered our shack that day he
broke open a bundle and spread a gar-
ment out on the table before me and
then i understood he held up the

cloth between thumb and forefinger
for me to see

   the feel av it he growled the
thickness av it father tis about as
smooth and soft as sacking

  and that big riverman said ungodly
things under his breath of the shop and
its keeper at beckett

   but its at least white and clean
i tried to console him what else mat-
ters now

  he broke in without waiting for
me to finish

  and no more than good enough for
the wife of jean coteau he finished

   jean coteaus wife is a good
woman i chided him then shes no
less righteous for the coarseness of her
garments

  i could have saved my breath for
all the heed he paid he slipped his
shoulders into the pack straps again
but he turned in the doorway his face
clearing a little

   but its your-rself wholl be goin
out to the mission in the spr-ring
maybe youll be afther br-ringinl back
with you then father-twill be but

little tr-rouble-

  he broke off suddenly i could 
longer hide it i could no longer keep
it from showing in my eyes

  what is it he asked father
what is there wr-rong

 how would you have told him
well i too found it hard to pick
words that would not hurt him too
much

   spring conahan i exclaimed
in the spring why man dont you
know that long before the frost is out
of the trails shell have gone on out
to her own people

 he stood and scanned my face-
scanned it inch for inch i have never
been quite certain but he may even
have been smiling a little

   her people he repeated gravely
out to her own people

  i had expected to see the pain flare
conahan

up in his eyes i had expectcd to sec
his shoulders slacken and droop in-
stead there he stood smiling quietly
gently as though i were no more than
a child

   aye father he finished after a
moment aye you would be right no
doubt but id given it no thought
myself

  he went out i watched him cross
to the cabin to take her the things
which he had grumbled were not line
enough for her body and then i sat
and half ate the heart of me out for
him i could almost hear her cry out
like nothing so much as a pleased child
i could almost see her lying there look-
ing at him out of eyes that had gone
damp and blurred when she realized
what he had tried to do for her

  i do not know how long it was-
far too long certainly-and then i
started up at a hand on my shoulder
it was nightfall he had sat with her
until she slept and there he stood be-
side me and looked down into my face
for a long moment before his hand
tightened on my shoulder

   father he commanded father
youll be afther stoppin now dont
waste your pity man

  oui he had been reading me-read-
ing as easily as he read the woods or
the weather every thought that had
been with me day after day throughout
the week

   youve been thinkin only av the
littleness av her he went on slowly
after a moment av her fineness but
father i ask you now does her fine-
ness make the br-rain av me anny less
clear-or my body anny less clean 
youre afther rememberin that ive
br-roke ere now with my own hands
men who would play me cr-rooked-
you know they name me the whole
river length the man who will have
what he will have-but have you been
believin that that would make me anny



less gentle if twas gentle i wanted
to be

  he wheeled and crossed to the door
and threw it open the lean hard bulk
of him looming out against the back-
ground of the snow through the door-
frame i lifted my head then and saw
conahan for the first time the stiff
stubble that had been on his face when
he came down from the camp upriver
was gone his face was as smooth as
my own save for a little brush across
the lip and as he stood and half
smiled at me realization came like a
blow in the face in his tight wide
lips and weather-tanned jaw i saw for
the first time the unspoiled still un-
beaten youth of him msieur i real-
ized that conahan was young

   youll sorrow no more for me
thin father he said and his voice
rang a little ill have no man pity in
me

  he went out and closed the door
behind him and that night without
rest or sleep he flung off on the trail
that wound north into the big timber
upriver often enough there was a
twist in his heavy speech there was no
twist in the soul of conahan

  again father le fevre paused

  msieur lie went  at last she
did not go out to her people in the
spring i learned long afterward what
conahan must have known somehow
without asking from the very first that
there were no people to whom the girl
might go hardly more than a day or
two after conahan went back upriver
she was up and about again and the
very first day she was able to walk i
did a strange thing just why i did
it i do not know but it was i for all
that who spoke first to the fur agent
and then to her of the plan that came
into my head

  the agents wife had been ill for
years and the little nurse he had
brought up from the states to care for
her had died in the fall the agent


peoples

was more than glad to have some one
to fill her place and she-the girl
with the thick shimmering hair-why
i think now that she had not once even
dreamed of going out from singing
river

  she took the little board shack that
stood against the agents house yonder
across the square and carried across
to it that same day all the things that
conahan had brought her from beckett
it took several trips even with me to
help and last of all i carried over the
little canvas-lashed pack that conahan
had taken from the sledge that first
day in no more than a day or two i
had grown accustomed to seeing her
slim figure in the suit of vivid blanket-
ing which conahan had brought her
flashing back and forth from her cabin
or jean coteaus place to the door of
the agents house

  i think she seemed more boyish
than ever in that bit of a belted coat
and short thick skirt that reached
barely to her moccasin tops but she
never wore anything over her head and
there was nothing boyish about the
great golden mass of hair that crowned
it and blew about her face

  in all that time she spoke just once
of herself that was the same night
after i had suggested her staying as
nurse

   my name is louise hatfield she
told me then after a long moment of
silence i had not asked the question
i had not even been looking at her but
i could not help but wheel and lift my
head at the words her voice came
slowly almost harshly and yet scarcely
loud enough to be heard when i
turned her head was thrown back and
her lip was white and deep-dented by
her teeth i could not quite understand
at that moment the light in her eyes i
could hardly know that it was loathing
-bitter loathing for her own name and
so i answered steadily enough

   very well

  but a day or two later i saw more
clearly i came to see some things very
clearly indeed

  i had crossed to her little shack just
before dusk-i cannot remember the
errand there was a thaw in the air
that night the snow did not squeal
under my weight so she could not hear
my approach even though the door of
the shack swung half open there was
no light in the single room save that
from the fire on the hearth and against
that blaze she stood half facing away
from me msieur she had opened that
canvas-lashed pack at last and scat-
tered all about the floor were things-
things of the sheer fineness of which
conahan had never dreamed

  she stood there motionless back
toward me her arms outstretched and
from her hands even with her face a
gown hung down quite to the floor-
a gown of stuff as flimsy as the river
mist scarcely thicker than a mans
frosted breath with the firelight
through it it was the color of burgundy
-red as blood and the flickering light
of the blaze quivered and glanced from
bits of tinsel that crusted it thick from
top to hem-bits of silver shaped like
a butterflys wings it was a wonder-
ful thing a totally wonderful thing
and beside her in a heedless heap lay
two slippers of satin with heels no
thicker-waisted than a mans thumb
and stockings like cobweb they too
were redder than the fire

  all that i saw in one instant just
as you might see the river basin yonder
under a lightning flash-just as vividly
and as quickly and while i stared
she stooped swiftly and crushed that
tinseled gown and the rest into a ball
between her hands and jammed it down
tight upon the burning logs straight
and stiff and rigid she stood while the
flame crept over them i could not see
her face but i heard the sound in her
throat as she swayed a little and then
leaned hard against the rough-stone
r

conahan



chimney and buried her face in her
arms

  i turned and went back to my own
cabin

  each time i looked at her after that
the picture of her as she stood when
she had burned the spangled dress that
night with her head bowed against the
stone chimney of her bare little cabin
flashed back to me i thought of a
thousand things i could say when the
time came and when the time did
come i said scarcely anything

  it happened the night the wind
swung into the south and brought the
first warm rain i knew instantly-i
understood all that had happened the
moment she swung open my cabin door
and stood there her hair bright with
bits of moisture she was panting-
she had been running hard a minute
or more she waited and then she threw
wide her arms-like that msieur-and
choked and ran and knelt and put her
head on my knees i waited till the dry
sobs no longer shook her shoulders-
waited until she grew quieter and lifted
her head and looked up at me it was
a girls face no longer it was a woman
who knelt there at my feet

  father she begged father can
you help me a little now 

  i leaned over and looked into her
face and for all the pain that swam
in them her eyes were as brave and
clear as the eyes of that colliejock

  you care for him i asked her
at last

   care she echoed care id die
for him-id die so gladly

  i shook my head

   it is not enough i told her-and
her body went slack her head bowed
and lifted again and she wet her lips
with the tip of her tongue

   i kfiow that too she whispered
i knew that-was not enough

  i rose and raised her to her feet

  would you live for him i asked
her then would you live for him day

and night  do you care enough to
keep on living when nothing would be
quite so easy as death

  she could not speak she-she just
nodded her head those gray eyes of
hers were like stars in the dead white
of her face

   then that is all that any one could
hope for on earth i said to her as
gently as  knew how that is all that
any man could ever ask

  she bowed her head and crossed the
room but at the door she wheeled-
wheeled and ran back to me and knelt
and put my hand against her cheek
and i married them that same week-
conahan and that slim girl with the
hair the color of raw gold

  i do not have to tell you that they
were happy you know conahan well
enough now yourself to answer that
question why day in and day out
during that summer she went at dusk
to the head of the rise there and waited
for him and one night when 
chanced to look from this window one
night when he had come off the basin
later than usual and it was dark i saw
them pass the lighted windows of their
own cabin and she was not walking at
his side hed swung her up on his
arm and was carrying her back not in
a very different fashion from that first
night when he brought her in out of
the storm the collie jock trotted
gravely at his heel i heard faintly the
lilting treble of her laugh they were
happy-happy enough

  summer ran into fall and the men
went back upriver-and with them
went conahan she was more than a
little lonely those first few days after
his going that was how it chanced
that  was sitting on the steps before
their cabin on the evening of the second
day when a canoe swung around the
far bend of the basin and glided up to
the bank lie was a stranger-the man
who held the paddle i could see that
even while he was hauling the frail


peoples

craft out over the logs he must have
been some time on the trails for the
canoe floated light

  he was not a river jack nor a pros-
pector down from the hills he was
just a drifter like yourself on his way
out to the states and i was watching
him-watching curiously for new faces
were not frequent here at singing river
-when i became suddenly conscious of
the woman behind me

  she had been standing in the door-
way talking and laughing a little now
her voice trailed off into a queer silence
and when i turned she was leaning
forward tense as steel staring at the
newcomer-staring hard and breathing
quickly he did not see us or even
turn his head and after he had passed
from view toward jean coteaus the
girls eyes swung to mine

   why do you know him  i asked
in quick surprise i spoke before i
thought it was quite a while before
she answered

   i-i thought she faltered at last

i thought he was- he looked like

a man i once knew a little

  that was all she said-all she had
a chance to say-for at that same mo-
ment the fur agent came hurrying
across from his house and begged her
to go back with him quickly she went
-went immediately-and conahan
came back down from the river camp
not a half hour later that same night

  before he was a dozen paces from
me he asked for her and when i told
him that the agents wife was very ill
he stood for an instant his face
clouded then he turned aimlessly and
started for jean coteaus and i rose
and went with him

  msieur have you ever felt even
without hearing or turning to see the
presence of some other person in the
room behind you  then you will under-
stand a little how i knew without real
reason that the thing for which i had

been waiting day after day was about
to come that night

  we crossed to coteaus but the men
tilted back against the walls did not
even notice our coming that night
they were listening to something else
far too eagerly to hear us entering the
door was wide for the night was warm
and as conahan stopped stock-still in
the doorway i looked over his shoulder
and saw the thing that had halted him

  there in the middle of the room sat
that man whom i had seen hauling out
his canoe from the basin barely a half
hour before every man in the room
was bent toward him jean coteau
leaned hard across the bar and on the
strangers knee lay the nose of that
yellow collie jock

  he had been talking of something
that was holding them as one man just
for an instant he had hesitated in his
tale and at the moment of our coming
he picked it up afresh

   -he ran the biggest place in

larrsen he went on speaking to the
whole room the biggest faro layout
in the town men called it the straight-
est game in the hudson bay country
even if they did hate him better than
any man in the north they called
him straight and he wasnt and they
found it out that night

  it happened like this a stranger
had come in from the southward and
the first night he bucked that game he
came as near as any living man ever
came to breaking the bank she was
dealing that night-the girl there
wasnt a cleaner swifter handler of the
cards in all the northwest her game
was straight too dont doubt that

  well he nearly broke the house
that night and when they quit in the
morning he laughed at the man who
owned the layout and promised to be
back in the evening to finish the job
hatfield-that was the proprietors
name-just smiled a little and told him
he would be welcome and when play
   

conahan

opened that next night he took the deal
himself the girl had his place as
lookout

   the room was full-jammed to the
corners with men who had come to
watch at first he won-the stranger
i mean-and then the crazy luck that
had been his the night before turned
dead around steadily with every fall
of the cards he lost and lost until when
he was about cleaned out he shoved
what was left of his stack across the
cloth and asked the bank to make it all
or nothing the dealer laughed in his
face and whipped out the cards and
he was sweeping in the chips when she
swung down panther-quick-that girl
who had been lookout-and shot her
arm over his shoulder and ripped open
the crooked box

   you could have heard a pin hit the
floor in that room for an instant and
then things got pretty thick a chair
crashed over as hatfield leaped to his
feet he screamed an oath at her and
struck at her face then he reached
for his gun he would have killed her
that night only the stranger was
quicker a bit he drew the quicker
gun and he got hatfield first-high
through the right shoulder

  he stopped again for a moment in
his story eyes the whole length and
breadth of that room were beginning to
lift furtively to the face of the man
there in the open door beside me con-
ahan was standing like a man turned
to stone all but jean coteau under-
stood and coteau only leaned farther
across the bar and begged for the rest
of the story

   and thees ees their dog he asked
you know heem

  the stranger put his hand on the
collies head and looked down into his
face

   jock  he coaxed jock sir

  and the dog cocked his ears and
whined back at him



  know him that man cried
know him why he was the lead
dog of the only sledge team below the
yukon that could have brought them
through the storm of that next week
he was the lead for hatfields string
they went from larrsen that same
night for hatfield was hard hit and
going fast nobody saw them leave
they were just gone the next morning
i dont know why she stuck to him
for men often wondered why she
hadnt killed him herself long before
that i doubt if anybody will ever
know but she left larrsen that night
and took him with her maybe it was
because blood is thicker than water
after all but that is hard to believe
but she was his daughter-that girl
who dealt faro for hatfields bank-
the daughter of silent hatfield from
little salmon to the line men knew
of her-they called her lady lou

   the storm wiped out their trail
three days out he finished the
stranger who had done for hatfield
tried to follow and lost them that third
day no word ever came back from
them men who ought to know said
that they couldnt have lived the bliz-
zard out-but here is their lead dog
jock tell me-did they win through

  he waited for his answer-and still
waited nobody spoke i felt con-
ahans body tightening and tightening
then in one stride he crossed to that
man who sat with the dogs nose on
his knee by both shoulders he gripped
him and half lifted him and whirled
him about in his chair that stranger
was no coward for he looked death in
the face that instant calmly without
flinching i liked his face for all that
it was very hard about the lips it
was honest i could see that and con-
ahan must have realized it too for his
grip slowly loosened a long time he
stared into the strangers eyes before he
spoke with deadly deliberation

  if you have lied to-night he


peoples

promised him ill kill you myself in
the morning

  then he turned-turned and went
more slowly than  had ever seen him
go before back across to his cabin i
went with him i was afraid to leave
him alone that night

  the cabin was empty-she was still
sitting with the agents wife-and hour
after hour he sat there in that room
which she had made so much like her-
self waiting for her he sat with his
face in his hands never moving never
lifting his head msieur can you
quite understand what that night was
to him why all that other men had
found in many women he had found
in her alone

  it was almost dawn when he lifted
his head for the first time his face
white and stiff as a mask and stared
straight before him at nothing at all

   she lied to me he said aloud an-
swering the question that had been
throbbing all night in his brain she
lied to me-if she did not tell the whole
truth

  then i heard her coming she was
running-she had seen the light and
she cried out to him as she stood in
the doorway-cried out gladly to him
and-and then stood dumb gripping
the frame

  she knew she knew she had
seen the stranger pass across to co-
teaus she saw the face of that man
before her haggard and white eyes
devouring her face and she needed no
further explanation to make her under-
stand she started toward him impul-
sively and then stopped minute after
minute passed with the painful pulse
pounding in his temples then he
spoke

   i have to ask you-for-r you failed
to tell me all he said i want it fr-rom
your own lips

  he was half mad and that was the
question he flung at her her face
lamed and then went white and she

leaned toward him as though she would
not believe what she had heard

  then she stiffened as though it
were a lash he had struck her with
and she answered him quietly almost
word for word in the words of the
stranger in jean coteaus

   im the girl who dealt faro for
hatfields bank im the girl they call
lady lou

  dont you see it was the pride of her
he had touched  why it was the blood
of that man who lay yonder under the
pines good blood for all his twisted
lips for there was another answer
that she could have given him-oui a
far different one there was no an-
swer she would give to that question
as conahan asked it that night and
conahan groped out with his hands on
the table as though his eyes no longer
saw and steadied himself erect he
swayed as he crossed to the door

  i tried to bar his passage

 you cannot go now i cried out
at him man you cannot go like this
 she lied to me he repeated
hoarsely she lied for she did not tell
the whole truth

   then i lied too i was desperate
that night i lied too for i knew as
much as that

  he looked down at me as though i
were some curious creature that he had
never seen before and that was the
only time conahan ever spoke to me in
anger

   then ill tell you now so that you
may know he said too much r-right-
eousness will tur-rn stale anny real
mans soul stand aside he warned-
and i stood aside before the thing that
was in that mans face

  the stranger whose canoe lay in the
basin was waiting for me when  went
back to my cabin he met me at the
door

   father he asked father what
have i done

   youve done a great hurt to a good
conahan

man-and a far better woman i
answered him

  then  told him all that had hap-
pened-all there was to tell-from the
night when conahan first found her at
the trail end below the dam he under-
stood and sat silent a long time after
i had finished

   i wish i could have known he
said finally i wish i could have told
him the rest 

  and then there in my cabin he told
me the story of silent hatfield and of
the girl who was his daughter-the girl
men called lady lou

  nobody ever seemed to know quite
who he was or from where he hailed
or why in spite of all the care he took
of her he hated that girl-child as he
did only a few who were keener than
the rest realized that it might have been
because she was white and golden-
because day by day she grew more and
more like the other woman who when
she could no longer stay with him and
live had run away and left him and the
baby too

   it was he the stranger told me
who bought her that crimson spangled
dress-her own father he dressed
her like any other woman of the dance
halls and set her to deal faro for his
bank why he simply went to work
in cold blood to make her what all the
others were just because her face was
fine and smooth and reminded him of
the face of the woman he hated of
course he wasnt sane there are many
men here in the north who have lived
too long with one idea and gone stark
raving mad

   but that was what he just tried to
do-and he failed and in the two
years that followed he grew to fear
that girl as he had never feared any-
thing on earth hed taught her too
well for her own hatred of him grew
to be a deadly thing he failed
father the stranger said and i should
know for i am the man who almost



broke hatfields bank i am the man
who shot him that night and of all
the men who knew that girl called lady
lou there is not one but would tell
you what i have told to-night-not one
who would not have shot gladly in my
place

  morning had come when the man
had finished his story he was going
on out that day and he paused just a
moment in the door as he was leaving

   i wish i could have known he
repeated gravely will you tell him
father when he comes downriver
again he will believe it from your
lips

  i looked across at conahans cabin
after he had gone it was broad day-
light but i could see through the win-
dow a light still burning she looked
up as i stopped in the doorway her
eyes were dry-dry and feverishly
bright at that moment i wished only
that she might weep msieur she was
still standing-standing stiffly erect
where she had stood when conahan
passed her and went out into the night

   why i asked her then why
didnt you tell him all

  something in her face as she looked
at me recalled vividly the loathing i
had seen in her eyes that day when she
first told me her name-loathing for
the very name she bore she under-
stood my question she knew that the
stranger had told me the rest and she
gazed fixedly into my face before she
spoke

   at first-her voice was a dull
weary monotone-that first night i
hoped no one would ever know i
hoped it had died with him there in
the storm then when i grew stronger
and could think clearly i knew that
couldnt be i thought he knew-i
thought you understood the day i told
you my name-and did not speak be-
cause he understood

  she stood clenching and unclench-
ing her hands


peoples

   i fought a week in that blizzard
she flared out bitterly with nothing to
keep me up for the day he died he
threw the provisions from the sledge
while i was breaking trail so that i
would die too i fought two years
to keep out of hell itself because some-
how i believed-i who had never been
taught-that some day there might be
a man who would care because i had
made a good fight i could have an-
swered him-i could have told him
that father he had no faith

  out msieur that was it it was
the woman pride of her what could i
do-or say the stranger had told me
to tell conahan the truth-all the truth
-when he came downriver again but
conahan did not come

  throughout the fall and far into the
winter i waited and he did not come
down the river road many many days
i would have gone for him except for
what i saw in her eyes i had inter-
fered too much already

  and she-she went on living not
much different from the way she had
lived before i married them days
when she was needed she cared for the
agents wife but she stayed on in con-
ahans cabin often id see her at night
through a lighted window and cross
to talk with her for a little while id
see her sewing always sewing and yet
when i knocked and she opened the
door after a little longer wait than
usual there would not be so much as
a needle in sight when i entered her
small face was growing wistful those
days-wistful and hungry-eyed-and
her lips that had always smiled so read-
ily smiled but seldom now

  i should have understood-yet i did
not had i known i would never have
gone out to the mission that winter
but i did not understand-and i was
gone a month

  the night i came back and rode
down the beckett trail that runs into
the square yonder almost the first thing

i saw was jean coteaus little bay mare
standing already hitched to a sleigh be-
fore conahans door coteau himself
saw me coming and he raced to meet
me and then he told me quickly but
not so brokenly but what i understood
i too was running when we crossed
back to the cabin

  the doctor opened the door for me
it seemed as though he was always
where he was needed most-that doc-
tor i often wonder if he ever slept
-or just died tired he opened the
door and held up his hand and shook
his head-so then he stood aside for
me to pass coteau uncovered and fol-
lowed me in

  msieur i have never seen a face
quite as beautiful as that girls face
was that night it was as white as the
night when conahan found her and
brought her in save for two brilliant
crimson spots that glowed beneath her
eyes her lids lifted as i crossed to
her and she smiled a little and started
to speak as though my coming at that
moment was quite the most natural
thing in the world i had to lean close
to catch the words

   i promised you i would she
breathed i told you i cared enough-
to keep on living its hard it would
be very much easier-to die

  she fumbled under her pillow until
her fingers closed over the thing she
sought

  will you take this to him she
begged nie take it and give it to
him and tell him if he will hurry-i
will try to be here when he comes tell
him father please that i am very
tired-waiting

  she pressed the thing she had drawn
from under her pillow into my hand
and then i saw what it was-just a bit
of soft white linen msieur a bit of a
garment scarcely larger than a mans
hand i took it from her and nodded
my head and somehow found my way
outside
conahan



  jean coteau put the reins into my
hands his face was set

  msieur i am not going to tell you
of that drive that night i want to tell
the rest quickly but jean coteau had
good reason to love that little thorough-
bred mare of his for she was little
more than wet when the lights of the
long bunk house and close beside it
conahans own shack burst out ahead
of me through the trees

  i saw him through the window even
before i had leaped from the sleigh
he was sitting alone before a dead fire
his head in his hands i-i hesitated
a moment at the door fumbling in my
pocket for that bit of white cloth which
the girl had given me

  then i went in

  he came to his feet at my entrance
his face was thin but it was granite
hard we stood a long time staring
into each others eyes then i went
over to him

   conahan i said conahan man
do you believe that any but a good
woman could ever have made stitches
fine and soft as these

  and i held out that small garment
to him

  he took it-took it and held it in
both hands before his eyes he went
white then the blood poured back into
his face while he gazed at it i saw
his lips quiver saw him fight to steady
them before his eyes blurred and he
bowed his head

  i told him the rest we had lost
too much time already i told him that
she had said he must hurry-that she
would try to be there when he came-
and before i had- finished he was out-
side and swinging the sleigh around
in the beaten track

  and yet he dared not open the door
of his lighted cabin an hour later when
we drew rein before it he reached
out his hand for the latch and it trem-
bled till there was no strength left in

the fingers i pulled off my mitten and
put out my hand and saw that it was
wet and stained with blood my shoul-
der had hit that stump hard msieur
blood had been running down warm
inside my sleeve conahan stared at
it a moment in odd fascination then
he reached again steadily this time for
the latch

   father that big riverman mur-
mured to me father youre more than
a bit av a man

 he opened the door and we
went in

  how can i tell you to-night how
long he stood and gazed at her i
hardly knew that night how long it was
he just stood and stared and stared at
her white face half buried in her thick
hair and then-then his head bowed
his shoulders dropped and a dry sob
racked him blindly he went across
to her and as he knelt he broke con-
ahan went all to pieces

  and she just put her hands on his
bowed head and-man man she
murmured until his shoulders shook
no longer and he slipped his arm be-
neath her and held her close

  he must have whispered a prayer
in her ear for she reached down and
touched the bit of a bundle that lay
beside her and put her cheek against
his

   stay she quavered repeating his
words stay why i could hardly
go now could -and leave ta lone-
some men

  the old doctor from beckett caught
my eye and nodded his head toward
my cabin i turned to follow him out
but at the door we both halted at the
thin little cry that went through the
room

  the head of conahan lifted as he
heard then he turned his face toward
us the soul of him there in his eyes

   hark ye father listen he
whispered listen tis conahans

suppose that you were a multi-millionaire-young-alone in the world suppose
that a building a block square and fifteen stories high was utilized to house the
various money-making schemes that poured gold into your coffers suppose
that you had so much money you could not spend your income on yourself
no matter how extravagant you might be what would you do with it
would you just let it pile up and accumulate as mr nicholas knox did-
or would you be inclined to listen to the big idea mr aimes advances 

chapter i

the holdup

mr nicholas knox de-
scended from the car at his own
door it was a small very
smart town car done in dark blue-and
there were two men in attendance-two
men who were of the same build and
complexion and who looked almost ex-
actly alike in their liveries the foot-
man holding the door as mr knox
alighted bade him good night very re-
spectfully-in spite of the fact that it
was rather near morning mr knox
replied to the courtesy with a vague
nod and crossing the pavement that
intervened climbed the white stone
steps to his dwelling-glistening in the
moonlight

  no light gleamed anywhere from any
of the windows for behind the shin-
ing glass and fine lace panels were
drawn blinds and thick draperies in-

side the hall would be cheerfully
lighted-the stairway too and his own
suite on the floor above-and the night
man would be moving about making a
solemn circuit of the many rooms but
from the outside the place looked un-
utterably cold lonely and unhomelike

  mr knox admitted this to himself
as he fumbled for his keys-admitted
it as he had admitted it innumerable
times before for-perhaps-the thou-
sandth time he was wondering what
in the world lie could do about it when
he became aware that he was not alone
in the broad vestibule some one-a
man in evening clothes-had advanced
noiselessly from behind the ornamental
boxwood in the corner and he wore a
black silk mask over the upper part
of his face also he had a revolver
which was leveled directly at mr
knoxs heart-or so it seemed to mr
knox

  his dark eyes opened wide with curi-
nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox 

osity and interest-brightened with ex-
citement he was conscious of the first
thrill that had stirred him in years a
burglar a masked burglar with a
gun in his own vestibule-exactly a
block and a half from the weary po-
liceman on fixed post-and only a few
feet from the night man on duty some-
where within  mr knox instantly
forgot his fatigue his inevitable bore-
dom his satiation his heart began to
beat actively his blood began to flow
more quickly

  how dyou do he said pleasantly
turning a bit so that he faced the other
exactly fine night for a murder
eh 

  the burglar seemed for just an in-
stant a bit astonished however he
speedily recovered himself and an-
swered grimly in a voice that was not
quite steady

  this isnt a joke im in dead
earnest and this gun is loaded id
have no compunction about shooting
you

 really asked mr knox with
some interest

  take your hand out of your pocket
and dont attempt to call for aid inci-
dentally i am a crack shot

  i shouldnt think of calling for aid
answered mr knox frankly it
would be too bad to spoil such an in-
teresting situation seriously you have
turned a dull and stupid evening into a
red-letter night what can i do for
you 

 the highwayman-evidently never
having met with such a reception under
similar circumstances-was silent an in-
stant studying his victim in the dim
light then he responded curtly

 i want money of course how
much have you about you

  mr knox reflected

  oh a hundred or so perhaps

  a hundred repeated the burglar
in astonishment and disgust and disap-
pointment a hundred dollars

about that probably i usually
carry somewhere in that neighborhood
the burglar was silent mr knox
waited an instant peering regretfully
at the other man

  isnt it enough he asked

  not nearly answered the other
slowly i might have known you
wouldnt have much more with you

but i- havent you any checks

  not here not with me heaps of
em inside in my desk if youll come
in-

  there was nothing in his voice but
polite invitation the burglar laughed
softly his amusement conquering his
disappointment mr knox laughed a
little too

  would that be destroying the ethics
of your profession  he asked i
dare say it would or do you suspect
me of attempting to lead you into a
trap

  the idea would never have occurred
to me answered the gentlemanly high-
wayman sarcastically

  mr knox sighed

  yes i suppose the natural thing
would be for me to snare you-or try
to but on my word id no such in-
tention i was thinking that i might
spend an hour or two pleasantly in
your company i suffer from insom-
nia you see and i get sick of books
and chess my man sometimes plays
chess with me and theres nothing else
-but solitaire i was thinking that a
long comfortable chat with you might
keep me amused until my bedtime
how much money were you expecting
to take from me

  i need twenty-five thousand dol-
lars answered the burglar slowly
ive got to raise that much before
morning

  twenty-five thousand  is that your
usual nights haul 

  no answered the burglar mod-
estly with the hint of laughter in his
voice no not my usual nights haul


peoples

exactly this is an exceptional case
ive got to get twenty-five thousand
before to-morrow

  thats rather a lot observed mr
knox regretfully im afraid i havent
that much in cash in the house how-
evef if youd take my check or some

odds and ends of silver or jewelry-

would that do at all

  dont make me laugh begged the
highwayman

  still fearful of treachery that
isnt complimentary you know consid-
ering that ive given my word

  your word to a highwayman isnt
very binding especially when he has the
drop on you

  put down the gun then and ill
give you my word voluntarily youll
still have the advantage of me phys-
ically youre bigger and more mus-
cular

  the highwayman apparently thought
that over then he put down his gun
slowly if there had been more light
he would have been seen to look a little
dazed by this turn of things

  now said mr knox cheerfully
heres a sporting proposition for you
come in with me and well have a
drink and a little chat you shall be
my guest for an hour or so entitled to
all the courtesies of my hospitality
then you are to be free to go with
my check for twenty-five thousand
and i give you my word-ill do it in
writing if you like-that the check will
not be stopped neither will i attempt
to seek you out and reclaim the money
or punish you hows that

  you arent serious gasped the
highwayman

 i am on my honor why the
thrill youve given me to-night and the
entertainment i expect from your con-
versation are well worth twenty-five
thousand dollars to me ive so much
money that twenty-five thousand dol-
lars has absolutely no value to me but
thrills surprises good stories in-

teresting philosophy ideas great
guns those things are invaluable dont
you see

  the burglar hesitated

  come come my word of honor
ill stand by my bargain went on
knox i simply cant miss this op-
portunity of conversing with a real
genuine honest-to-goodness burglar
the burglar sighed

  but im not a regular burglar he
admitted ive never attempted to
burgle before to-night

  no then you are a man of cour-
age and nerve anyway-and of ideas
and there must be a story behind your
little flyer in crime come in burglar
or no burglar my offer holds

  very well agreed the near-high-
wayman finally id take you up 
mr knox breathed a little sigh of
content thrust his hand deep into his
pocket found his latchkey and opened
the heavy brass-trimmed door the
desperado still in his black silk mask
and carrying his gun followed his host
into the big gorgeously furnished
brilliantly lighted foyer hall the night
man a huge fellow ruddy-faced sat
in a big armchair by the grate smoking
a pipe and reading the newspaper he
rose in haste-at the sight of his mas-
ter-and stood aghast before his mas-
ters companion

  evening rogers said knox ab-
sently are there lights in the study
yes sir said rogers his eyes go-
ing wildly from knox to the masked
man trained as he was to express as-
tonishment at nothing this visitor was
almost too much for him besides
there were the paper and the pipe to
explain and ask pardon for mr

knox sir- he began wetting his

lips

  some of that french brandy rog-
ers in the study said knox interrupt-
ing unless you prefer a cocktail-
or-something else

  he turned politely to his guest
nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox 

  the brandy sounds inviting an-
swered the masked man nodding

  at once rogers ordered knox
then he added to his visitor this
way

  they mounted the great staircase to
the floor above there mr knox
turned left and threw open the door
of his study a low tire burned here
in the grate too to battle with the chill
and damp of the early spring

  you will find this chair most com-
fortable said mr knox indicating a
huge-armed one throw your hat and
coat anywhere and make yourself at
home ill just change for a lounge
coat if you dont mind

  he passed through a second door-
way into his bedchamber and closed
the door behind him the burglar left
alone so unceremoniously glanced
about him listened shrugged and
dropped his revolver into the side
pocket of his light topcoat then he
removed the coat threw it upon the
couch put his hat with it and remov-
ing his mask added that he stood
revealed now a man of perhaps twen-
ty-six or so exceedingly well molded
and distinctly handsome he was fair
and had blue eyes but his features were
rather rough-hewn and his skin was
tanned he suggested the out-of-door
man the man who is engaged in do-
ing rather than in directing and plan-
ning but he wore his formal clothes
as one who had been born to such
things sinking into the big chair that
knox had indicated he drew out a cig-
arette case it was of gold and ini-
tials were done on it in platinum-b
a selecting a cigarette he lighted it
and put the case back into his waist-
coat pocket as knox came back

  this is infinitely better he com-
mented with satisfaction as bis eyes
fell upon his guest he had changed
his dress coat for a tuxedo jacket of
royal purple stuff edged with cardinal
and the colors emphasized his darkness

-skin ivory and pallid eyes and hair
very black he had lighted a cigarette
too but he smoked it through a very
long ivory-and-gold cigarette holder
seating himself opposite the unmasked
highwayman he observed critically  i
was not mistaken in my guess you are
young and well born evening clothes
give a man away or establish his claim
to gentility 

  yes admitted the other nodding
my family is accorded a certain social
recognition

 in new york

  yes we live within a few blocks
from here

its odd i do not know you then
you know my people ive been
away from home for a long time that
explains why you do not recognize me
mr knox leaned forward expect-
antly

  youll introduce yourself of course
it being understood that the manner of
our meeting is to remain a secret be-
tween us

  the other nodded and shrugged

  i suppose so youd be sure to
know sooner or later anyway because
we are sure to meet again i am bige-
low aimes

 aimes son of robinson aimes
i knew i saw a resemblance to some
one

  young aimes nodded indifferently 
i am supposed to resemble my fa-
ther somewhat

  you do

  there came a knock at the door
come in  called knox wearily
rogers entered with a tray on which
were a small curiously shaped bottle
two glasses and a siphon of soda

  that will do rogers said knox
as the night man set down his tray his
eyes seeking aimes in some curiosity
dont lock up or extinguish the lights
until mr aimes goes

  yes sir said rogers departing
  mr knox moved toward the table


peoples

and drew the cork from the curiously
shaped bottle

  soda he asked as he began to
pour out the brandy

  please said aimes

  mr knox prepared both glasses in
the same fashion then as he ex-
tended one to his midnight-or early
morning-visitor he said

  i am all impatience what in the
world induced the son of robinson
aimes to turn burglar

  the force of circumstances an-
swered aimes coolly i could think of
no other way to raise twenty-five thou-
sand before morning and it was up to
me to raise that much-or see the gov-
ernor go to the wall

  what gasped mr knox staring
  aimes nodded

  almost nobody knows it but-hes
hard pressed you dont interest your-
self in the street much 

  no answered mr knox shaking
his head rather not theres no ex-
citement for me in winning more
money i have too much as it is 

  i see well if you were in touch
with the street at all youd know that
things have been going on there-an
upheaval of some sort-raids counter-
raids manipulation my governor was
mixed up in some movement or other
and got the dirty end of the deal sev-
eral of his friends combined to rob
him as a consequence he has to have
twenty-five thousand to-morrow or hell
go under hes been trying all day to
get it but couldnt you see the fights
been on a long time and hes drained
his resources and i guess you can im-
agine what a smash-up would mean
it would mean the loss of everything
for even my mothers properties have
gone to aid him she and my sister
would well they simply couldnt live
as theyd have to live if he went under
a flat you know no servants no cars
no comforts it would be simply im-
possible 

  knox nodded thoughtfully

  i dare say so you had this idea
for raising the money

  yes i had been thinking for hours
but couldnt find any way out i was
in the library at home we all were
my mother and father were there too
hed just told us lliane was standing
at the window-my sister you know-
and your car went by

  my car repeated mr knox curi-
ously

  aimes nodded

   its a funny world lliane said
when she saw it theres nicholas
knox with so much money he cant
spend it all hed never miss what we
need to save ourselves 

  i see said knox nodding

  i asked my father if he had asked
you to help him he answered that he
knew you hardly at all that he had no
security to offer you anyway and that
your men of business would never hear
of such a transaction even if you were
willing that set my mind going and
almost at once i got this idea

  it was a fearful risk to run said
knox you might have been killed
or caught-arrested-disgraced at the
very least i wonder you dared risk
it

  i was desperate answered aimes
calmly i vowed that i would get the
money i vowed that i would prove
myself in this emergency that i would
repay my fathers years of affection
care leniency and belief in me hes
given me every opportunity to carve out
my own career when i flunked at
yale he gave me another chance at
harvard he gave me opportunities
to travel and see life always he has
denied me nothing that his money or
influence could obtain for me i wanted
to prove my gratitude by aiding him in
his greatest hour of need and i was
willing to risk anything to do it

  mr knox smiled

  probably no burglar ever started out
nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox 

with more creditable intentions you
have gone robin llood one better but
 should never have thought of such an
extraordinary solution to your diffi-
culty if i had been in your place sup-
pose i had resisted you suppose i
had attacked you or had cried for help
instead of pleasantly falling in with
your mood 

  id have knocked you on the head
with the butt of my gun-gently you
know then id have removed my
mask hidden my gun and would have
rifled your pockets then i would have
rung the bell and would have helped
the servants carry you in id have
announced that you were held up and
that i had come to your aid you
wouldnt have recognized me without
my mask and id probably have been
able on the strength of your gratitude
to negotiate a loan

  knox grinned

  you are ingenious i suppose i
shouldnt have suspected that my high-
wayman was robinson aimes son
of course not

  i would have been grateful to you
for rescuing me from the robber and
id certainly have agreed to lend you
the twenty-five thousand

  if i had known any one to confide
in said mr aimes i would have
worked it that way in the beginning
id have had some one else hold you
up and id have rescued you only i
didnt know any one else i could trust
mr knox laughed

  you are a man of ideas he cried
for what wece you expelled from
yale

  mr aimes smiled reminiscently
for defending the honor of the uni-
versity a musical comedy came to
new haven and the star wore a yale
jersey he was just about everything
we didnt want people to think yale
men were he couldnt have won his
y playing checkers so i induced a
number of my fellow students to re-

monstrate with him we visited him
and informed him what would happen
if he continued to wear the y the
next night he wore it and everything
that we had predicted happened he
was deluged with overripe fruit and
vegetables and eggs under my lead-
ership a gallant crew climbed upon the
stage and wrested the sacred y from
his manly bosom that was all

  has your career been full of such
adventures asked mr knox envi-
ously

  i have managed to enjoy life ad-
mitted mr aimes

  youve been particularly fortunate
then sighed mr knox ive only
bored myself to distraction for twenty-
six years

  you dont mean that gasped
aimes

  i do

  bored-with all your money
what difference does money make
asked mr knox listlessly

  all the difference in the world oh
lord what a time i could have had
with your brilliant opportunities what
a career

  how asked mr knox opening
his eyes

  why every way why theres
nothing you couldnt do great heav-
ens if a waiter offended you you could
buy the hotel and burn it down if you
didnt like the way the mexicans were
behaving you could buy an army and
beat them into submission then you
could run things to suit yourself you
could go in for politics and clean up
the country you could-why you
could do anything that youd a mind
to how much money have you any-
way 

  i dont know answered knox
shrugging more than i need
have you spent your yearly income
one year to your knowledge

  no i cant after all a mans ex-


peoples

penses are limited i havent even a
wife you know

  aimes leaped to his feet and began
to pace the floor

  such a waste he groaned its
positively sinful limited why are
a mans expenditures limited mine
shouldnt be id have hard work get-
ting through on it-no matter how
much id have life would be one end-
less stream of adventures id live in
an atmosphere of excitement mystery
marvels magic if things didnt hap-
pen id make them happen id have
my nose into everything id make
history id alter the map of the world
to suit myself id put myself above
the law id be-why id just about
run things thats what id do if i
were a multimillionaire

  mr knox was sitting motionless
staring up into the others flushed face

  but how would you go about it

  mr aimes shrugged

  id find some way

  mr knox leaned over and poured
himself another drink

  have something he asked

  no thanks answered aimes
shortly

  mr knox drank the brandy and soda
thirstily then he glanced up at aimes
again

  exactly what is your profession
he asked

  aimes shrugged

  i studied engineering-mine engi-
neering-but i havent gone in for it
ive been traveling about sizing things
up

  you are free then to accept a post
-employment 

  ye-es admitted aimes slowly

  how would you like the position of
amusement deviser

  of what cried aimes staring

  amusement deviser discoverer of
adventures call it anything you please
all youd be required to do would be
to go about with me and-stir things

up make things happen involve us in
interesting adventures you know
something after the manner of that
caliph of bagdad and his grand vizier
what you said about my opportunities
and about what youd do in my place
gave me the idea i havent the imag-
ination it seems to do the trick my-
self i wouldnt know how to go about
it you have the imagination the cour-
age the nerves but not the money so
why not a partnership

  aimes drew a long breath

  do you mean it

  absolutely-entirely if you could
make life worth living for me youd
be worth a fortune to me

  aimes grinned

  it sounds too ridiculous drawing
a salary for doing exactly what i most
enjoy doing

  will you  asked knox breathlessly

  i will

  they shook hands upon it

chapter ii

granting wishes

  what shall we do first and when
shall we do it asked mr knox fum-
bling for a cigarette bigelow aimes
offered his case

  try these i brought them back
from london its a special brand of
my own chap in euston grove makes
them up for me

  mr knox lighted the cigarette and
inhaled

  rather he cried in emphatic
approval

  mr aimes was not thinking of cig-
arettes however he was frowning
thoughtfully at the queerly shaped bot-
tle of brandy on the table between them
and his mind was on the earlier ques-
tion

  that caliph-of-bagdad stunt is
worth thinking about he said i used
to eat up those adventures when i was
a youngster lets see the caliph and
nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox 

his vizier went around the city in dis-
guise didnt they so far so good
vve can pass for any ordinary young
fellows no one meeting us will have
any idea of the power we wield or of
the hundreds of millions behind us
but in stories things happen to you
in life youve usually got to start some-
thing i find wed have a dull time
waiting for adventures how can we
set the ball rolling

  knox watched the intent face of mr
aimes eagerly

  i havent an idea or id have done
it long ago when i think of the nights
ive spent here in this gloomy barracks
reading dull trash or playing chess with
armand-or solitaire

  and parading under your very win-
dows perhaps hundreds of creatures
to whom a hundred-millionth part of
your income would seem like heavenly
intervention  think of it you here
alone bored world-weary and down-
town an office building a block long and
a block deep and fifteen stories high
devoted to the money-making interests
that pour gold into your coffers all
the rest of the world or three-fourths
of it at any rate in need its terrible
and wonderful it gives you a star-
tling power why you could go about
if you chose like a man of magic con-
ferring blessings scattering happiness
granting wishes  why not 

  he stopped short his blue eyes firing
why not what better way to
spend your money and get your nose
into other peoples business what
better chance for adventure every
creature in the world has some secret
wish some far off impossible wish that
stands for happiness the wishes dif-
fer as widely as the individuals who
harbor them imagine going forth at
night mixing with the crowds and
studying faces until some one face
stands out from the rest and attracts
you imagine halting that one individ-
ual and demanding his or her greatest

wish imagine granting it imagine
converting that endless stream of dol-
lars into a real power to influence man-
kind you could bring romance and
poetry back to life you could re-
awaken faith in magic and miracles
you could become famous you could
take your place in history alongside the
renowned caliph harun-al-kashid
mr knox nodded gravely

  it sounds enticing but do you think
it practicable

  i do why not

  are persons likely to believe we
mean well by them arent they apt to
think us mad if we stop them and ask
them their greatest wish or arent
they apt to think we are intending to
fleece them 

  possibly but such obstacles will
only add interest to our adventures
we must convince them of our serious-
ness it will be no end of fun we
must carry enough money-in gold-
to astonish the most skeptical and con-
vince them i suppose most of them
will confess that money is their chief
wish

  if many of them wish for millions
even my wealth wont stand out long
against the drain

  we wont stop that sort often
well pick out interesting needy im-
aginative ones-creatures capable of
unusual and diverting wishes not
mere moneygrubbers or mere tramps
or hobos or bums or beggars elderly
scholars struggling geniuses thought-
ful old ladies wistful young girls medi-
ocre seamstresses ambitious parlor
maids energetic white wings or police-
men or firemen oh we shall delve
into the fascinating depths of human
emotions

when shall we begin asked knox
eagerly its twenty minutes to four
not to-night by any means an-
swered aimes emphatically i am half
dead now for want of sleep and 


peoples

shall have to be up early to get that
check cashed at the bank

  knox nodded and leaped to his feet
ill write it now while i think of
it twenty-five thousand you are
sure that will be enough

  yes answered aimes

  knox moved off in the direction of
the desk in the corner picked up one
bank book at random from a heap of
different ones that lay there wrote the
check tore it out filled in the stub and
balanced then he closed the book and
replaced it with the rest

  to bigelow aimes twenty-five
thousand dollars read mr knox
correct

  he handed over the check

  entirely youve-no idea how
grateful i am for this dear fellow
i-

  nonsense a bargains a bargain
you came in and chatted with me in
return for that remuneration and just
between ourselves youve been worth
it to me or youre going to be do
you know how ive been spending my
days until now  going to dinners balls
dances receptions teas theaters opera
horse show garden parties-all the
tiresome stunts on the social calendar
ive gone to bed one day at dawn to
awaken in time to be bored again the
next night all the sparkle and snap
have gone out of things if you can set
things happening as you say you can
to-night will mark the crisis in my life
-the turning point-the moment when
things became worth while and i shall
be eternally indebted to you

  mr aimes smiled

  ill make things lively enough for
you he promised folding the check
and slipping it into his wallet then
he reached for his hat

  why dont you stop the night
urged knox hospitably there are
several hundred unoccupied bedrooms
and its almost daylight

  but i live quite close and ive even-

ing clothes on no id better get on
but ill tell you what i will do ill
dine with you to-morrow night at seven
and afterward well go out and look for
trouble what

  done agreed mr knox

  they shook hands warmly as warmly
as though they had been friends for
years then mr knox conducted mr
aimes to the head of the stairs and
watched rogers let him out below

  the erstwhile thief strode content-
edly down fifty-seventh street to the
avenue and down the avenue for two
blocks at which point he mounted the
steps of the aimes residence mr
nicholas knox entered his bedcham-
ber and with the aid of his valet went
to bed for the first time in a couple
of years he fell asleep at once

  mr knox awoke at one oclock upon
the following afternoon one was his
usual rising hour armand the french
valet who had served him faithfully
for some ten years had a cold shower
prepared-beginning with the chill off
and ending at a freezing temperature
then mr knox was rubbed down until
his body glowed and by the time he
had completed his afternoon toilet he
was in splendid appetite for his break-
fast or luncheon or whatever you
might choose to call his first meal of
the day that afternoon there were
only two teas and one reception at
which he felt called upon to appear so
he had time to stop at the bank and
cash a check getting five thousand dol-
lars in notes and gold this against
the evenings adventure then he drove
through the park picking up mrs
phillip ladew and miss ladew as he
had promised the night before and re-
signedly began his afternoon rounds
by six oclock he was free and hurry-
ing home he changed in good time
mr aimes as it happened was late
in fact mr knox had just begun to
wonder if the whole thing had been a
nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox 

hoax if aimes hadnt been aimes at
all but some regular highwayman-if
he had been tricked and deceived-
when the gentleman himself was an-
nounced he came in with the lithe
confident step and the eager smile that
had won mr knox so easily the night
before if ever there lived a more
keenly alive young man than mr lige-
low aimes mr knox had never seen
him mr aimes radiated good humor
and good-fellowship

  here we are he cried happily
shaking hands a little late but none
the worse for that ive been as busy
as a bee all day helping the governor
up to now thanks to you things look
fairly serene for him

  good cried mr knox

  good repeated aimes youve
no idea what catastrophe that twenty-
five thousand prevented youd have
thought the whole familyd gone mad
when i sprang that check at breakfast
my mother vowed shed always believe
in me my father almost wept my
sister said she knew id manage some-
how lucky nobody guessed how
can you imagine their faces if some-
body told em

  nobody will knox assured him

  i just let them believe that wed
known each other a long time and that
you gladly loaned me the money you
see our being seen together in future
will lend color to the tale

  to be sure agreed knox

 you havent changed your mind
about the big scheme then  asked
aimes eagerly

  ive hardly been able to wait for
to-night to come answered knox if
you fail to start things going ill-well
ill just give up in despair and shoot
myself

   no fear smiled mr aimes any
one who goes out looking for trouble
finds it and i dont care what we run
into o long as things happen eh
exactly agreed mr knox

  at that instant the butler announced
dinner and they adjourned to the din-
ing room it was a huge paneled
place done in dark wood and hung in
royal purple the huge table was set
with gold plate and fine china and
decorated with american beauties
aimes staring about him grinned ap-
preciatively

 reminds me of the arabian
nights  he observed if this is the
sort of thing you are up against regu-
larly i dont blame you in the least for
wanting to suicide conceive of dining
here alone with those stiff and disap-
proving ancestors watching every bite
ypu eat

  he nodded toward the portraits on
the wall

  i never dine here alone answered
knox not much my club when
ive no company

  a place like this is all right when
you have a grown family of seventeen
and several grandchildren went on
aimes otherwise i should prefer a
few rooms somewhere cheerful cozy
and decorated more for comfort than
for magnificence ill tell you what
close this place and well take an apart-
ment somewhere together or better
still keep this for headquarters anti
well open a flat on the side i suppose
you know you are not going to be nich-
olas knox when we are adventuring

  who am i going to be asked mr
knox

  any one else you please but not
mr knox it would give the whole
thing away the newspapers would
get on our trail and good-by adven-
tures the big thing is to remain in-
cognito so it mightnt be a bad idea
to have a flat somewhere under the
names that we choose for our escapades
let me see i shall be-mr bigelow-
using my first name for my last what
first name begins with b  for eu-
phonys sake you know-benjamin
benjamin bigelow and you


peoples

  anything shrugged knox

  how about merlin the enchanter
you know mr merlin-mr maurice
merlin does that strike you
thats all right  guess

  right ill have cards engraved
for us to-morrow mr benjamin bige-
low and mr maurice merlin and well
have bigelow and merlin on the door
of our flat instead of aimes and knox
and well keep clothes and things there
and a new valet who knows us only
under our assumed names we may
as well systematize this thing

  it begins to sound mysterious ad-
mitted knox smiling

  wait its only just begun  prom-
ised aimes well pick out an apart-
ment to-morrow and furnish it and in-
stall servants you might open an ac-
count somewhere under the name of
merlin-just against emergencies you
know but for the most part well
carry cash on us have you some for
to-night 

  five thousand answered knox
ample well probably not use it
i dare say half the time well have
small need for money then again we
may need a good deal it all depends
one thing more have you a re-
volver

  yes

  good take it along with money
and a revolver a man can do almost
anything

  all these plans had been laid during
the butlers trips to the pantry now
however he remained in the dining
room and an under servant made the
trips consequently mr aimes talked
about south sea islanders his luck at
monte carlo and the stupidity of the
london cabmen until the coffee and
liqueurs had come

  mr aimes had come at a quarter to
eight instead of at seven as he had
agreed therefore it was precisely one
hour later-a quarter of nine-when

the two adventurers descended the steps
of the knox house

  now cried mr aimes contentedly
we have the night before us and a
fine clear night too the world will
be out of doors and well have hun-
dreds of individuals to choose from
let us walk slowly and keep our eyes
open

  the early-spring weather had turned
mild and pleasant the moon was out
the sky was sprinkled with stars as
they sauntered toward the avenue and
headed downtown aimes went on med-
itatively 

  theres something intoxicating to
me about the city at night the many
many houses hiding heaven knows
what tragedies and comedies the
crowds the lights the hurrying vehi-
cles mystery is everywhere hearts
are breaking near us other hearts are
signing with joy unimagined men and
women are facing death i feel the
nearness of it all in the air

  knox turned and stared curiously

  ive always hated crowds he said
i never walk when i can ride apart
from the whole pushing procession

  youve missed a lot you must rub
shoulders with all of humanity to un-
derstand the meaning of living to en-
joy and suffer

  they had reached the upper forties
and now had come opposite the old
duke house built twenty years before
by phillemon duke the mining king
it presented the same dark untenanted
face to the world that the other pal-
aces of the rich presented but as they
passed it something happened the
broad doors at the head of the stone
steps opened for just an instant reveal-
ing a glimpse of a red-hung hall and a
white-haired old servant in attendance
a man came out and with a swift
glance about him a glance of dread
apparently turned west then the
doors closed again and the house re-
nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox 

sumed its appearance of unlighted
gloom

  aimes turned swiftly to knox

  did you see the face of that chap 
he asked eagerly

 yes rather pale eh scared
looking

  rather admitted aimes decisively
i think there is to-nights adventure
what do you say

 i am in your hands answered
knox

  aimes glanced again at the duke
house then turned and peered ahead at
the young man who had come forth
from it and decided

  come on he cried briskly we
may as well chance him he looked
as if he is involved in something lets
quicken our pace and overtake him

  it was not so easily done their
quarry was making good headway
with his hands deep in the pockets of
a light topcoat his head down he was
hurrying west toward broadway and
he had come within a few feet of the
chief thoroughfare before they came up
behind him

  then suddenly as they drew near
he seemed to become aware of their
approaching footsteps turning he
glanced at them over his shoulder
nervously fearfully appraisingly
aimes caught a glance nodded and
then-

  just a moment if you please said
aimes

  the man before them turned ashen
over his face flashed such an expres-
sion as neither man had ever seen be-
fore he looked desperate helpless
beaten terrified he looked like an ani-
mal driven to cover and face to face
with inevitable capture wildly his
eyes sought some means of escape but
knox and aimes were by this time
quite close and to elude them was ob-
viously impossible relaxing evidently
accepting his defeat the man collapsed
and would have fallen if aimes had not

reached out and caught him at the last
moment

  get a cab he cried imperatively to
knox youll find one somewhere
there on broadway any kind of a
vehicle

  is he dead gasped knox horri-
fied

 no fainted hurry

  knox moved off at a good pace look-
ing in every direction for a vehicle of
some sort a roaming yellow taxi
caught his eye he whistled and beck-
oned but the chauffeur had to made a
detour to reach him in compliance with
the traffic regulations and by the time
he was back with the cab a little knot
of curious pedestrians surrounded mr
aimes and the man who had fainted
however aimes had been equal to the
occasion it was supposed that the
cause of the collapse was too many
cocktails and no one interferred with
suggestions knox and aimes got their
young gentleman into the taxi as speed-
ily as possible and aimes called out to
the driver

  the waldorf as quickly as pos-
sible 

  then he slammed the door and the
cab started

  the waldorf repeated knox in-
terestedly why the waldorf

  ive no intention of going there
really explained aimes but i bad
no desire to call my real destination in
the ears of the crowd well take him
to my rooms i think i have some at
the polo club on park avenue will
you tell the chauffeur

  mr aimes was leaning over the col-
lapsed gentleman in an attempt to as-
sure himself that nothing serious was
the matter and he was assured for as
knox leaned out to direct the driver
the fainting gentleman opened his eyes
and looked up into mr aimes anxious
face

  ah thats better cried aimes


peoples

encouragingly stay where you are
and get a grip on yourself

  this as the other was struggling for-
ward into a more erect position

  where am i where are you tak-
ing me who are you cried the ter-
rified young man in an uncertain voice

  you are in a cab headed for my
rooms at the polo club as for my
identity and that of my friend that is
a matter that is of  real concern
we mean no harm to you if that is
what you are afraid of on the con-
trary we are inclined to be of service
to you if we can but all that can
wait we will be in my rooms in a
few moments

  the young man who had fainted
was silent now frowning a little re-
garding knox and aimes with inquir-
ing doubtful eyes he was very thin
and he had a dull unhealthy pallor that
seemed to hint of insufficient sunlight
and fresh air he was extremely nerv-
ous his long slender fingers seemed
continually in action his features were
singularly even and clear cut which
gave him an air of weakness and yet
he was by way of being good looking
he had very light-brown eyes and short-
cut brown hair

  aimes studying him drew out his
cigarette case and offered it
cigarette he asked politely

  the other seized one avidly lighted
it and inhaled

  thanks he answered then i-i
-need something to steady me pm-
just about all in 

  thats evident enough said aimes
im sorry if i gave you the last jolt
by accosting you-startling you 

  the other shrugged and said noth-
ing and a few moments later the taxi
halted before the door of the polo club
the three men descended and while
knox paid off the cabman aimes and
the young man he had accosted went
on ahead into the lobby before the
lift they waited for knox then all

three ascended together to aimes
rooms he had two and a bath a liv-
ing room and a bedchamber in the
living room he invited knox and the
third man to have chairs and himself
wheeled forward a cellaret stocked
with various liquors cigars and ciga-
rettes

  something to drink he asked

 knox shook his head the other
man nodded

  thanks he said some whisky
straight for mine

  aimes poured it out for him took a
swallow himself and then drawing a
third chair up facing the other two he
threw himself into it

  now to business he said calmly
and leaning back he regarded the
young man thoughtfully i suppose
he went on you have been wondering
who in thunder we are and what in
thunder we mean by picking you up as
we have done and dragging you down
here

  perhaps i have a vague idea said
the unknown young man a little
hoarsely his eyes were burning now
and some color had come into his pale
cheeks thanks to the goodly draft of
whisky

  i hardly think so said aimes if
you have assumed that we are involved
in your affairs in any way you are mis-
taken we know nothing about you
neither your name nor your business
nor -your associations we never laid
eyes on you until we saw you come
down the steps of the duke house to-
night at least  never did

  nor i admitted mr knox he
was gazing from aimes to the unknown
young man interestedly his usual air
of listlessness had vanished utterly

  the unknown young man was staring

  youve got me guessing now for
sure he admitted frankly if you
never saw me before and knew noth-
ing about me why did you follow me
and grab me
nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox 

  for reasons of our own answered
mr aimes the reasons behind our
unusual behavior do not concern you
nor any one else save ourselves how-
ever some small explanation is coming
to you here it is we followed you
and accosted you because you looked as
if you were in deep trouble and we
make a business of accosting people who
look that way it is up to you to take
advantage now of an extraordinary
opportunity my friend and i are pre-
pared to aid you if it lies within our
power to be of use but first of all
it is necessary that you answer one
question truthfully

  what is the question asked the
unknown young man after an instants
hesitation

  what do you wish for most in the
whole world if there were such a
thing as magic and i and my friend had
a knowledge of it and if we could grant
you one wish what would you have
the unknown young man looked
from ames to knox with a curious
expression

  he isnt mad said mr knox
why is it that any one who behaves
in an original and unusual manner is
instantly suspected of being mad
asked mr aimes mournfully must
we all behave like a lot of puppets danc-
ing on strings can none of us dis-
play a hint of imagination

  the unknown man frowned a little
your question sounded so absurd
he said half apologetically it seemed
hardly likely that any one would stop
a stranger in the street to ask him such
a question unless there were some ulte-
rior purpose behind the thing or unless
the person were mad magic you

know-

  he shook his head

  i didnt say we have any magic
power answered aimes of course
we havent i merely asked what you
would wish for if we had i dare say
theres no harm in compiling statistics

about secret wishes is there can you
think of any reason why we shouldnt
go about asking people that question
if we have the time and the inclination
and if we desire to know the answer
for reasons of our own

  no-o admitted the unknown man
very well then said aimes let
us lose no more time over a useless
discussion have you a wish if you
have are you inclined to tell it to us
if you are fire away otherwise let
us separate speedily and go our sep-
arate ways

  the unknown young man reflected
of course i have a wish he said
slowly i have so many wishes in
fact that i hardly know which one id
have granted if i could have one of
them i guess every one wants things
-long life health money happiness
he finished wistfully almost inau-
dibly

  but if you could have just one this
minute asked aimes if anything
you asked for could come to pass what
would you have

 money answered the unknown
man slowly at this minute i need
three thousand dollars more than any-
thing else in the world

  mr aimes turned to mr knox
  the wallet please he said

  mr knox drew it out and extended
it a long black leather pocket case
mr aimes opened it inside were many
bills-tens twenties hundreds and two
one-thousand-dollar ones he drew
them out

  here are your three thousand dol-
lars he said coolly counting out the
exact amount yours in return for
your story not as a loan but as a
gift and with them you have our prom-
ise to consider what you tell us as abso-
lutely confidential

  the unknown man was leaning for-
ward staring wildly at the money in
mr aimes hands he had gone white


peoples

again his mouth had fallen open a
bit he wet his lips

  what i he cried helplessly youll
-give me that much-just to hear-
why i-need it

  exactly answered mr aimes
the unknown man brushed a hand
back across his head nervously

  im going mad he said or else-
im dreaming-or else-you are quite
mad three thousand dollars youll
give it to me if i tel you why i need
it

  you are slow to seize opportuni-
ties sighed mr aimes suppose we
are mad enough to throw three thou-
sand dollars away for a story what
is it to you why dont you grasp this
chance and get yourself out of the
scrape you are evidently in 

  god knows what is really back of
your offer said the unknown man i
dont thats why i dont snap you
up badly as  need the money

 then you refuse asked mr
aimes apparently waiting for the an-
swer before hitting the money away
again the unknown man leaped to
his feet and began to pace the floor

  no he cried restlessly no i
darent refuse i darent ive no
other hope and i must get that much
money if l have to-to swing for it

when you stopped me-i- he

shook himself violently and threw up
his head ill take you ive got to
take you up he said i know very
well that no one throws three thousand
away for nothing without a mighty
good reason but ive got to take you 
and when the time comes ill pay the
reckoning whatever it is

he threw himself into his chair again
well he said rather defiantly
better have another drink said mr
knox solicitously you look pretty
nearly all in

 the unknown young man nodded
aimes poured it out for him and gave
it to him

  your name asked mr aimes
then

  kenneth neece answered the un-
known young man do you know it

  both aimes and knox shook their
heads

  youve probably forgotten he
said dully

  what asked aimes interestedly

  the name-the notoriety i had a
couple of years ago

  notoriety asked aimes

  yes i was cashier in a new york
bank and absconded-at least thats
what they called it i didnt run away
though i just juggled the books and
knew i should get caught i did it
because i had to have money my
mother was hurt iri a railroad accident
and she had to have an operation at
once i hadnt the money and the
railroad headed us oft fifty ways when
we tried to sue so i took what i
needed from the bank

  strange i dont remember the case
said aimes do you

  knox shook his head

  no it isnt strange answered
neece none of this came out i just
pleaded guilty and took what was com-
ing to me my mother had died be-
fore they caught me and id hidden
the rest of the money that i took for
my sister there were just two of us
left and she was seventeen i got seven
years but i got off with four for good
behavior i came out three months
ago

  how old are you asked aimes
slowly

  twenty-eight i was just short of
twenty-four when i was sent up but
i didnt mind going i had the satis-
faction of knowing that my mother had
had everything she needed or wanted
before she died and that my sister had
enough to keep her comfortable until
i could get out again she swore she
wouldnt touch the money but of course
she had to it wasnt so easy to get
ppm- u--fl

nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox

work as she thought anyway she
tried and she did get a job in the end
it was on the stage she went into
the chorus under another name so no-
bodyd know about what had happened
to me and two years after i went up
she married duke

who cried aimes wonderingly
george p duke you said you saw
me come out of the duke house didnt
you well that is her house my sis-
ters house

 your sister was-

  ann neece but she changed her
name to antoinette terrel when she
went on the stage she married duke
under the name of terrel he doesnt
know to this day that that wasnt her
name and that she has a brother who
is a jailbird shes never had the cour-
age to tell him his people raised a
fuss as it was

  knox and aimes were leaning for-
ward listening eagerly

 but you go there to the very
house asked aimes how is that
to-night is the first time ive ever
been there she usually meets me out-
side but to-night she didnt come when
she should have and i thought some-
thing might have happened so i went
there she told me shed sent me a
note by messenger but  never received
it those infernal messengers never
deliver promptly its probably waiting
for me now but as it happens the
best thing i could have done was to go
there

  why asked aimes

  because duke has missed her ru-
bies we thought he wouldnt but he
did she pretended not to know what
became of them so he said they must
have been stolen he got in two de-
tectives and they said theyd search the
pawnshops if they find them theyll
discover that she pawned them herself
and shell have to tell him about me
then therell be a smash-up hed



never stand for me and she loves
him

  neece leaped to his feet and began
to pace the floor

  she pawned them to get me enough
money to go west and start again we
got three thousand for them she
couldnt give me that much without
arousing his suspicion but she said he
would never miss the rubies it was
three days ago we pawned them this
morning i met a fellow who had the
same cell with me for a while up the
river he got out before me but hed
gone back to his old trade-thieving
couldnt help it somehow and they
were after him again hes more than
half gone with consumption too and i
knew if they got him hed die up there
so i divvied with him i gave him two
thousand and kept one for myself and
he got away then to-night when ann
was to come to say good-by she didnt
show up and i went to the house she
told me that duke had missed the ru-
bies and about the detectives and
urged me to get them out of pawn
before the detectives found them i
didnt dare tell her id let some of the
money go

  so you need the three thousand to
get the rubies out asked aimes
yes

  aimes leaped to his feet

  where are they is the place open
this late

  yes its always open its what
thieves call a fence you can put up
anything at any time for a fraction
of the objects value then you can
redeem it later or leave it-either way
you can get almost any sum from this
man if your goods warrant it

  you are sure it is open nights
its after dark he does the most
business between four oclock and
daylight his office is crowded your
wise thief loses no time in turning swag
into money

  lets start down that way then


peoples

weve no time to lose if the detectives
are on the trail if this is a well-known
fence theyll probably go there soon
said aimes especially since they
think the rubies were stolen

  they do admitted neece and
they suspect anns maid who is quite
innocent of course they put her
through a grilling but could find out
nothing ann would confess if they
actually moved against the girl but we
hope to avoid that by getting the rubies
back in time

  the elevator came up at this mo-
ment and the three men entered and
were dropped to the street level there
aimes hailed the first taxi in line

  what is the address he asked
neece

  crogans a pawnshop on the bow-
ery i forget the number but ill tell
him when to stop

  aimes repeated bowery and
stepped in the cab started

  theres a whole block of shops open-
ing into one another went on neece
crogans is on the corner then comes
a secondhand clothing shop and a bar-
ber shop and a pool room and an italian
fruit shop i think  and then a place that
keeps womens things and then a lodg-
ing house and a saloon you can go
into any place on the block and pass
through into crogans office if the
coppers trail you you can get out any
way you like its a fine nest

  how do you come to know so much
about it asked knox curiously

  morgan told me the cellmate i told
you about you remember many a
close run lies had to crogans and
many a close shave getting off

  its a wonder the police permit the
place to thrive if they know about it
oh they cant break crogan hes
a political power down there and there
are a few big men in with him theres
money in pawnbroking if you are let
alone to run the game as you please

  i dare say observed aimes

  crogan gives you about a fourthof
what a thing is worth then as a rule
he realizes more than its worth when
he lets go even if it is redeemed he
gets big interest so he wins either way
he cant lose

  unless the police take away his
stolen goods

  they dont not as a rule

  they were encroaching upon lower
broadway deserted now and silent a
narrow alley between gigantic walls

  what i doijt understand said
knox thoughtfully is why your sister
didnt go to your rooms to-night as
she had arranged even if her hus-
band had discovered the loss of the
jewels and had called in detectives how
did that prevent 

  she was afraid to go out for fear
she was being watched

  i see

  she was afraid if she should lead
them to my rooms they might drag me
into it

  i see

  so she sent the note to a messen-
ger office by one of the maids whom
she knew she could trust in the note
it seems she directed me to get the
jewels and send them to her at once
by messenger then sheurged me to
lie low until she could communicate
with me

  it seems to me a lot of trouble could
have been avoided if she had confessed
the truth to her husband at once put
in aimes if he loves her nothing
that she could tell him about you would
make any difference

  of course not i felt the same way
but she has set notions about his pride
and the social prominence of his fam-
ily she says that the world doesnt
care what my reasons were for taking
what didnt belong to me shes right
in that to be sure

  aimes leaned out and scanned the
neighborhood through which they were
passing
nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox 

  youd better keep your eyes open
now he said were turning into the
bowery

  neece turned to the window

  it isnt much farther now he said
and he drew out his pocket case and
began to search for the pawn ticket at
first it failed to materialize and neece
grew anxious aimes and knox too
followed his nervous fingers with curi-
ous eyes but in the end it turned up
just as the neighborhood was reached
and it was time to halt the chauffeur

  the three of them descended knox
bade the cab wait a little farther along
the block and then followed aimes and
neece into the dimly lighted shop

  it was the ordinary pawnshop ap-
parently there were the three gilded
wooden balls above the door the win-
dow full of odds and ends the iron
gratings there was the bell that jin-
gled when the door was opened there
was the ancient counter show case to
the left with a cashiers box at the end
and a doorway leading into the back of
the shop there was a safe too with
pat crogan in gilt letters on it and
there was a second doorway not
guarded by any gate on it however
in black letters was painted

private

  the huge irishman behind the coun-
ter looked up indifferently as the vis-
itors entered his gaze becoming fixed
as he observed their apparent gentility
their evening clothes and small won-
der they looked oddly out of place
in that dingy dirty shop lighted only
by gas jets that glimmered unevenly
through murky globes

  neece ignored the counter attend-
ant moved on toward the door marked
private and entered without the for-
mality of knocking knox and aimes
following found themselves not in the
office of pat crogan as they had ex-
pected but in a sort of waiting room
which led into crogans office proper

there was a worn old carpet on the
floor a row of common oak armchairs
ranged around the walls and there was
a picture of washington and another
of napoleon this completed the fur-
nishings

  two men and a woman were already
there waiting the woman looked like
a syrian peddler and she carried a suit
case similar to the ones they use for
holding their linens and spangled
shawls she had the dull listless face
and vapid eyes of ignorance but when
her turn came when genial crogan
came to the door to escort her in a
transformation occurred she became
in an instant a very eagle of a woman
shrewdness wisdom ingenuity gleam-
ing in her face the two men would
have been taken for crooks anywhere
they had the low foreheads the nar-
row close-set eyes the ape jaws of
crime and there was in their bearing a
certain uneasiness that revealed an ever-
present secret fear the syrian ped-
dler woman was with crogan half an
hour or more coming forth without
the suit case the two men were then
summoned crogan treating them with
less cordiality than he had displayed
to the syrian woman and dismissing
them in a few moments then he ap-
proached neece knox and aimes

  you gentlemen together he asked

  yes said neece

  you want to see me

  yes answered neece producing
the pawn check we want to redeem
this

  crogan took the check and looked at
it it said simply jewelry-


  you put it up asked croganscru-
tinizing neece

  yes

  all three

  no these gentlemen were not with
me

  come in said crogan retaining the


peoples

check and throwing open the door of
his office

  they followed him curiously and
found themselves in a small square
room there were a desk and a chair
and two other chairs for visitors be-
sides these things there was a huge safe
open on the desk were scattered
books papers newspaper clippings
packages of pawn tickets a scales va-
rious bottles of acid carefully labeled
and glass rods

  crogan sat down at the desk noted
the number of the ticket and drew
a big book toward him turning a few
pages he nodded with some satisfac-
tion

  i thought i recognized you he said
looking up at neece you had them
rubies and there was a woman with
you

  yes answered neece

 the gumshoes were here looking for
them this very night do you know
that

  no answered neece you didnt
give em up did you

  crogan grinned it was a hideous
performance for three teeth were gone
from the front of his mouth and they
left gaping open spaces

  three thousand im out on them
sparklers he said and four thou-
sand it takes to get them back im not
handing out anything gratis to the gum-
shoes

  four thousand  gasped aimes a
thousand advance

  and why not  asked crogan coolly
its little enough for the risk i run
youd not get a nickel on them regu-
larly on legal terms

  four thousands right interrupted
neece that was agreed to when we
put them in have you got them
handy

  i guess so said crogan he rose
and moved toward the safe throwing
open the great doors he searched for
the number on the ticket in his hand

for some time he searched going over
countless tickets while knox aimes
and neece looked at one another nerv-
ously and waited in the end crogan
turned back to them with a shake of
the head

  dont seem to be here he admitted
it must have been sent over to the
vault

  the vault repeated neece

  three doors along i cant keep
everything here you know things i
dont expect to go out for a long time
i send over there and as it comes time
for their term to be up they are sent
llack i thought your stuff hadnt gone
over yet being as they only came in a
couple of days ago but i guess they
have if youll wait here-

  he moved toward the door

  were rather pressed for time said
aimes if you dont mind well go
along with you

  if you like agreed crogan gen-
ially this way then

  he led the way back to the waiting
room which had filled up again in the
interim through a doorway in the rear
to a dark hall and then down a rickety
pair of wooden steps into a damp cel-
lar there was no light but crogan
produced an electric pocket torch
which disclosed old boxes and barrels
piles of clothing iron and junk and
odds and ends of everything picking
his course through this varied collec-
tion be zigzagged along for perhaps
a hundred paces then he turned
sharply to the left and mounted a
second rickety stairway the door at
the head of that led into a kitchen in
back of the barber shop an irish-
woman was sitting there beneath a
blazing gas jet looking at an evening
paper and smoking an old corncob pipe
she raised two sharp light-blue eyes at
the strange procession filing into her
kitchen but said nothing not even re-
plying to crogans nod

  stop here a while said the pawn-
nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox 

broker then and ill just be running
up above to see the vaults overhead

  there were four doors opening into
this kitchen three besides the one that
communicated with the barber shop in
front opening one of these three
crogan revealed a flight of steps and
began to ascend the door swung
closed behind him

  aimes turned and carefully examined
his surroundings then addressing the
irishwoman he said-in french

 pardon me madame do you un-
derstand this language i speak

  knox and neece stared at him curi-
ously so did the stout woman whom
he addressed

  go long wid yez said she

 you do not understand asked
aimes again in french

  fwhat is he jabberin there asked
the irishwoman grimly turning to
neece

  aimes prevented any reply still in
french he addressed mr knox

  i do not like this business of the
vault he said it is an excuse be
on your guard your gun is handy

  yes said knox

  watch for my signal to draw it it
may be necessary

  knoxs eyes grew wide but he nod-
ded agreement

  what is it asked neece who did
not know french

  he says that time presses and the
delay is most inconvenient answered
knox

  aimes walked deliberately to the
nearest door and opened it it gave
into the shop as he had supposed
there were three barber chairs and
three italian barbers in attendance
aimes closed that door moved to the
next and opened it it was a cupboard
or seemed so at first glance in the
rear however an opening led on into
the next building then came the door
that crogan had gone through and then

one leading into a dark alleyway in the
rear

  fwhat is it hes afther wantin
asked the irishwoman uneasily of
knox

  tell her we want the quickest way
to the street said aimes in french

  knox told her she pointed toward
the door that led into the shop

  that way said she are you uns
foileyed

  knox shrugged and replied that it
was quite possible then crogan re-
turned he had a jewel case in his
hand-a dark-red leather one under
his arm he carried paper in which to
wrap it advancing toward the three
men who were waiting in attitudes of
attention he held out his burden and
lifted the lid

  necklace earrings rings tiara and
three clasps he announced right
neece gave a vague glance at the glit-
tering baubles and nodded crogan was
about to close the box when aimes in-
terfered leaning over he inspected
the jewels critically

  they were not sealed when they
were intrusted to you for safe-keep-
ing he asked in apparent surprise

  they were not answered crogan
grimly them as uses me trusts me
aimes looked up into the mans
flushed face smiling slightly

  trusting is all very well among
friends he answered but you are a
stranger to us and our transaction is
purely a business one you examined
these trinkets carefully enough i dare
say before handing out three thousand
dollars on them

  what are you givin me roared
crogan angrily are you meanin to
accuse me of crooked dealing

  not in the least replied aimes i
am meaning to let you prove that you
are entirely on the square you have
a dichroscope i dare say

  crogan was apopleptic

  so he roared furiously with


peoples

the gumshoes trailin you you stand up
and tell me to prove im handling you
straight a lot of damned crooks tell
me what i am to do ive a mind to
hand you over by god ive a damned
good mind to send you where you be-
long you who had no hand in this

deal anyway you-the stream

of adjectives that followed exceeded
anything mr aimes had ever heard
before in his life

  mr aimes waited patiently until
there was silence then-

  did you say you have or havent a
dichroscope he asked

 pat crogan leaned forward and
thrust his hard face close to mr aimes
and pat crogans jaw was set and his
eyes were hard

  i didnt say he replied and
whats more i dont intend to if i
have one youll not see it that much
ill tell you straight then turning
to neece he added you are the man
i dealt with before tis you ill deal
with now and no one else that rings
in either you take these things off
me hands for four thousand clean or
you leave them whichever you like
but you does it quick see ive no
time to be standing here passin compli-
ments 

  neece looked helplessly at aimes
aimes smiled

  well take them said aimes but
well just call in a policeman to wit-
ness the transaction and to carry the
rubies to some place where they can be
tested if they are the same stones
that were delivered to you well make
 howl about the thousand you made
by usury if the stones have been
changed youll hand over the genuine
ones or youll pay dearly for them
do i make myself clear

  crogan grinned

  a cop is it he roared youll be
callin in a cop

  you seem to be laboring under the
misapprehension that we have some-

thing to fear from the law answered
mr aimes ive  doubt most of
your clients are forced to submit to
your rulings because they are thieves
and have  redress but you are deal-
ing with birds of a different caliber this
time mncrogan if you think ill not
call in a policeman watch me

  he turned swiftly and threw open the
door of the barber shop

  go out and hail the first bluecoat
you see he said turning to knox
dont come back without one

  knox advanced through the door-
way and started for the front of the
shop crogan grinned

  im sorry i cant be stayin here wid
yez he remarked but im a busy
man ill just be afther returnin these
to the vaults and when you are ready
you can let me know

  i think not youll not take those
things from this room until this little
matter is settled first come first
served your time belongs to us for
the present we deserve something for
that extra thousand dollars

  he had closed the door leading into
the shop and stood with his back
against it one hand was in his right-
hand coat pocket

  so said crogan grimly so its
my masther youre afther bein now is
it

  he picked up the jewel case from the
table where it lay and moved toward
the door that led upward toward the
vault but before he reached it aimes
had whipped out his revolver and had
leveled it at the irishman

  stop he commanded in low im-
perative tones open that door and ill
drop you

  crogan turned attracted by a sound
from the aged irishwoman at the table
and his face flushed as he found him-
self confronting a revolver

  so thats it he cried

  a nice little gun answered aimes
a sound out of you or the old woman
nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox 

there and youll never live to tell about
to-night i am a straight shot

  you think youre damned cute
whispered crogan hoarsely but you
dont know me mister slick guy you
have the upper hand now but my turn
will come some day im going to get
you for this if it takes twenty years

and when i does get you-

  he ground his teeth

  youll be where you belong in less
than twenty years answered aimes
and where you cant get any one

  a knock sounded on the door leading
into the shop

  whos there  called aimes shortly
knox with the policeman an-
swered an eager voice

  mr aimes stepped aside and still
keeping the drop on crogan called
come in

  knox ushered in a tall ruddy-faced
arm of the law both of them stopping
short at the tableau that met their eyes

  what the devil is this cried the
policeman staring pat crogan man
whats this i say 

  leave the shop door open mer-
lin  cried aimes

  knox responding to his other name
obeyed

 this damned crook- began

crogan

  be careful how you call names
warned aimes

  take him up bill roared crogan
ill make a charge when the time
comes ill make it all right with the
old man take him up and lets have
an end of this

  aimes did not look at the policeman
have a care how you act police-
man he said this man is conduct-
ing a resort here where stolen goods are
received he is guilty likewise of
usury and he has substituted stones in
the jewelry that he has in his hands
and that was pawned here thats
theft all three of these charges are
going to be pressed unless he alters his

demeanor at once and makes restitution
i am bigelow aimes son of robinson
aimes the man in the doorway be-
hind you is nicholas knox

  i made sure i recognized his face
gasped the policeman staring crogan
drew a long breath

  now added aimes slowly per-
haps you are convinced that we have the
power to punish this man

  come come said the policeman pa-
cificially sure theres some way to
settle the difference

  yes answered aimes readily if
he returns the identical stones that were
pawned with him and proves to our
satisfaction that he has done so well
call the whole thing quits and press
no charges otherwise a pretty career
is going to meet an untimely end

  well pat said the policeman sug-
gestively

  how do i know they are the guys
they claim asked crogan

  youll have to chance it answered
aimes

  sure i know the face of mr knox
added the policeman

  very well said crogan yielding
ive the other set upstairs ill fetch
it

  the old woman can fetch it inter-
posed aimes

  so crogan told the old woman to
get  from konheim with many
a grunt and groan and muttered curse
she climbed the stairs returning pres-
ently with the real set that neece had
pawned the other things that crogan
had intended to return were exact du-
plicates-worthless imitations in that
fashion he robbed the thieves who dis-
posed of their stolen goods through him
it was seldom indeed that any of them
wanted to redeem pawned treasures but
if they did crogan cheated them know-
ing that they had no redress and that
they would be compelled to patronize
him again nowhere else could they
turn swag into cash in a moment


peoples

crogan had a monopoly and if he
turned the same trick now and then on
honest customers who wandered in the
deceit was rarely discovered and when
it was discovered the victim suffered
in silence pawning usually is a secret
business and notoriety is never wel-
comed by the poor unfortunates who
seek that means of relief from financial
stress and storms

  it developed that crogan had a
dichroscope by means of which a true
ruby is instantly proven and when
aimes had satisfied himself that all was
right he knox and neece reentered
the cab that was still waiting and
headed again for upper manhattan

  they had been in the bowery some-
thing over an hour it was nearing
eleven when they finally started up-
town

chapter iii

straightening the tangle

  when we get near the house-my
sisters house suggested neece ill
phone and see if the road is still clear
duke had a business engagement and
had to go out but he may have returned
by this time if theres any chance of
meeting him id better not risk going
there

  suppose you get duke on the tele-
phone suggested mr aimes

  neece frowned

  i hadnt thought of that he ad-
mitted anxiously

  if you should just hang up with-
out speaking and pay your toll and
hurry away then central will report
that there was a mistake or that she
cant locate the party 

  mr neece nodded gratefully

  ill do that he promised

  and if your sister comes to the
phone 

  ill ask her if it is safe to bring them
right up

better say it that way so that if

any one is listening on the wire youll
give nothing away

  right approved mr knox you
think of everything  should have
come away from crogans with the im-
itation gems

  so should i admitted neece
  aimes smiled

  a burned child fears the fire like-
wise experience is the best instructor
i put up a diamond ring once while i
was at college and got a hundred on
it in due time i took it out but the
next time i tried to raise money that
way the fellow handed it back to me
and invited me to quit kidding my
diamond had turned to paste

  what did you do 

  nothing i reminded him that he
had given me a hundred on it before
pie answered not on that stone
maybe not i said but i havent had
that ring touched since you gave it back
to me better watch your servants
then said he i had nothing definite
on him you see besides my governor
wouldnt have liked the idea of my
pawning things so i couldnt go to law
all i could do was to put my loss down
to extra instructions 

 no wonder pawnbrokers grow
rich  said neece

  oh they dont all do it but lots of
them do i sized crogan up for a ras-
cal so i thought it best to take no
chances with him may i never meet
him after dark when i havent a gun
i shall never be able to make up to
you both for to-nights aid said neece
slowly but i shall never forget what
youve done for me

  for you rot smiled mr aimes
for the fun of the thing my boy
for the excitement the adventure the
danger your average man gets all this
by proxy through books and plays we
are more fortunate we go in for
things at firsthand to-night you
chanced to be the gainer to-morrow
night it will be some one else and the
nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox 

next night some one else again but al-
ways we shall be involved we will
benefit by rare experience thrills its
just a game we play you see and you
owe us nothing but we shall be un-
speakably indebted to you if you will
never betray our identities will you
favor us that far

  surely answered mr neece i
will do anything for you that i can
but for you heaven knows how to-
night might have ended it seemed
to me when you stopped me that to
kill myself and so relieve my sister of
a burden was the best way out of it
all 

  so we saved your life as well as a
fortune in gems observed mr knox
thoughtfully not a bad nights work
eh 

  he smiled at mr aimes

  and the night is not yet gone
added aimes

  neece looked out of the window

  thirty-eighth street already he
gasped it seems impossible

  from where will you phone asked
aimes

  forty-second i guess theres a
cigar store there on the corner

  mr knox and mr aimes waited pa-
tiently when neece descended but for
the fact that the jewel case still lay
on the seat between them they might
have become suspicious over his long
absence eventually however he
emerged halting to give the chauffeur
directions as he stepped in

  i had the deuce of a time getting a
connection he announced as the cab
started again but finally i got her
duke isnt home yet but he may come
in any minute and she is afraid i might
meet him if  go there so she is send-
ing her maid to my rooms for the
things then shell tell duke that the
jewels turned up-that they had been
mislaid merely and that will end the
whole thing

  but will it asked aime will

her husband believe in that explana-
tion 

  yes shell tell him that she put
them into the wrong case by mistake
and that finding the right case empty
she had raised the cry of thieves while
all the time they were there

  admitting then that he believes
her went on aimes what will you
do youve no money left to take you
west you know

  neece hesitated

  ill find something to do around
here he replied  can find something
to do surely ill change my name
and take anything that offers

  ill send you west volunteered mr
knox ive a ranch somewhere in
new mexico and you look as if the
life there would do you good

  mr neece smiled his face lighted
as it had not since the three had met
his eyes shone

  it used to be my ambition to be a
cowboy when i was a kid he said i
never thought i should be

  they drew up before a little hotel
on west forty-seventh street and de-
scended knox paid off the taxi the
bill was something short of twenty dol-
lars then neece left word at the desk
that a woman inquiring for him was to
be sent up directly to his sitting room
and the three of them ascended

  it was a typical hotel sitting room
there was just enough furniture to pro-
vide necessities draperies carpets
pictures had been ordered by the doz-
ens and looked that way a great
bunch of roses that mrs duke had sent
were thrust into a water pitcher for
lack of other vessel

  not very elegant said mr neece
as he switched on the lights and closed
the door behind him but a palace
alongside of what ive had these past
few years ever been through sing
sing

 no admitted both knox and

aimes


peoples

  you ought to go youd find it in-
structive you wouldnt see it to ad-
vantage though not properly youd
have to commit some crime against the
law and be sent up to see it right
somebody ought to do that and then
write it up ive often thought of
that 

  the old idea that prison should be
dreaded as a place loathsome and
noxious still persists in a good many
minds admitted aimes im afraid
sing sing isnt much worse than many
another jail

  i hope it is i hope so said neece
somberly he looked older as his
thoughts dwelt upon the subject bit-
ter memories quickened to life and
aimes watching him felt the necessity
for an interruption

  smoke he asked producing his
cigarette case

  neece hesitated

  it should be my place to play host
he said but  have little to offer you-
nothing worthy of you

  you could offer me nothing to equal
my own brand smiled aimes they
come to me from london under enor-
mous duty but over there they are
cheap so it evens up theres nothing
like an english cigarette in my esti-
mation

  knox and neece joined him and mr
aimes struck a match from which all
three drew fire as he tossed away the
burned-out stick the telephone rang
neece was across the room in an in-
stant answering

  hello he called    yes send
her up please i left word at the desk
to that effect  all right thank
you

  he rehung the receiver and turned

  my sisters maid he said then
he moved toward the door and opened
it slightly waiting there for the woman
to appear

  your sister trusts her absolutely
asked aimes

  yes shes had her for a long time
almost since she married

  aimes shrugged

it just occurred to me that here is
a big enough temptation to appeal to
almost any one pigeon-blood rubies
fine large ones and so many of them 
neece nodded

  but this woman has charge of all
my sisters possessions and then he
looked out of the half-open door as the
lift door clanged and called this
way nina

 the woman who entered a moment
later was short thin meek looking an
englishwoman obviously of incredible
insignificance she had an ordinary
face and an ordinary figure and she
wore an ordinary black dress and black
hat there was nothing distinctive
about her nothing individual hun-
dreds of her kind are serving the gen-
try all over the world as their moth-
ers served before them and as their
daughters will serve in future in a
crowd she would have gone her way
unseen undisturbed aimes studying
her keenly was forced to admit that
there was nothing about her to distrust

  here is a package nina said
neece that you are to take back di-
rectly to mrs duke has she told you
about it

  yes sir said nina

  you know what the contents are
asked aimes

  yes sir repeated nina

  then you understand the necessity
for getting back as speedily as possi-
ble

  yes sir

  neece put the jewel case in her arms
  did you come in a cab 

  yes sir answered nina

  youd better go back the same way
and dont stop anywhere advised
aimes

  no sir assented nina mrs
duke said that she will communicate
nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox 

with you sir she added to neece
good night sir

  good night answered all three
gentlemen nina advanced toward the
door which neece threw open for her
but she did not depart for the sim-
ple reason that she could not the way
was still barred by two gentlemen who
had apparently been in the act of en-
tering one of them was short and
stout with a protruding paunch in front
he was dressed in brown and carried a
brown bowler in his hand he was
freckled green-eyed and red-haired
the other man was bigger and had a
black mustache he was frowning
both men finding the door so con-
veniently opened walked in and the
frowning dark man closed it behind
him nina had retreated still hugging
the jewel case neece aimes and
knox were staring taken completely by
surprise	

  just a minute miss said the red-
haired man suavely you gentlemen
will pardon this interruption

 who the devil are you asked
aimes rising and advancing

schaffer of the k  s detective
agency answered the red-haired man
gently arc you mr kenneth neece
i am kenneth neece answered that
gentleman

  oh i see and these gentlemen
our identities do not concern you
answered aimes at least so far as
i am aware please be so good as to
explain your presence here it is not
the custom in most hotels to admit
strangers to the rooms of the guests
without announcing them

  it isnt the custom here either an-
swered the dark scowling gentleman by
the door this is an exception i am
here to vouch for mr schaffer i am
the house detective

  aimes bowed

  and your business gentlemen he
asked

 is with this woman answered

schaffer and with neece-and maybe
with you two also that remains to
be seen just at present my idea is to
search these rooms

 for what purpose asked mr
aimes

  for the purpose of finding some
property belonging to mrs george 
duke unless i miss my guess the
woman has it there in her hands
have you a warrant to search these
rooms asked aimes they have
been rented to mr neece and if you
have no warrant you are illegally forc-
ing an entrance here

  never mind about that said schaf-
fer coolly well settle about the war-
rant after

  no we wont answered aimes
well not settle about it later youll
produce your search warrant now or
get out

  you are not neece cried schaffer
angrily

  but i am voicing mr necces pro-
test and his attitude in this matter if
you overstep your authority you will be
prosecuted for it i warn you

  who are you so high and mighty
asked schaffer sarcastically

  that doesnt concern you

  oh yes it docs answered schaffer
  oh no it doesnt

  if it doesnt then it soon will
youre in none loo good company ill
tell you that

  ill be in better company in a min-
ute retorted aimes show your war-
rant or get out

  schaffer looked at the scowling dark
man by the door the scowling dark
man grunted

  go ahead dont pay any attention
to that noise advised the house detec-
tive if the things wasnt here he
wouldnt be raising such a kick find
them then therell be time enough
to settle that little matter about war-
rants

  schaffer nodded and advanced to-


peoples

ward nina who was waiting patiently
for an opportunity to depart

  ill have a look into that if you
please maam he said attempting to
take it nina retained her grip

  mr neece she cried appealingly
  neece gazed wildly at aimes

  for gods sake stop him wailed
neece aimes brought out his pistol
and leveled it at schaffer

  hands off he cried grimly ill
give you until i count ten to get out of
this room

  schaffer turned and his jaw dropped
as he found himself covered mr knox
had followed aimes example and was
covering the house detective

  one began aimes determinedly

two-

  wait cried neece eagerly just
hold them here a moment give nina
a start on them

 right cried aimes smiling
stand aside there

  aside  repeated knox planting the
muzzle of his revolver against the house
detectives chest you know theres
no penalty for killing any one who
breaks into ones rooms

  the house detective evidently feared
to risk it he backed ingloriously from
the door

  beat it nina ordered neece

  nina made for the door clutching her
bundle close again neece threw it
open and again nina found her way
barred this time by a soldierly-looking
gray-haired man in evening things he
was tall well built very erect as to
carriage and had an air of command
halting upon the threshold he stared
at nina then let his flashing eyes wan-
der on over the tableau behind her he
observed mr aimes with a gun cover-
ing schaffer he observed mr knox
with a gun covering the house detective
he observed mr neece holding the
door

  whats this he cried authorita-
tively

for heavens sake grab that girl
shouted schaffer in eager accents she
has the things you want in that box
the elderly gentleman reached for
the box

  give it to me nina he com-
manded

oh please mr duke sir begged

nina i-

  give it to me nina ordered duke
if it is not his nina put in aimes
cheerfully you are under no compul-
sion to give it to him

  nina gasped

  please sir it isnt yours sir she
ventured

  what are you doing here asked
duke shifting his ground

   that isnt his business either nina
prompted aimes when you are not
on duty your time is your own isnt
it you can go and come as you please
caiit you 

  ye-es sir admitted nina

  aimes changed his position so that he
could cover duke as well as schaffer

  you can go nina he said when-
ever you like if any one ventures to
stop you ill stop him

  nina took a tentative step toward the
door duke grew crimson

  nina he said you are only stor-
ing up trouble for yourself if you per-
sist in defying me i will swear out a
warrant for your arrest and accuse you
of stealing my wifes gems so far i
have hesitated because of your faithful
service in the past but this new attitude
of defiance this willingness to be ad-
vised by this person is unworthy of
you if you have nothing to fear from
me there can be no harm in my glanc-
ing at what you have in your arms
nina stood motionless troubled
well repeated duke impatiently
take it on the run nina urged
aimes if he does have you arrested
youll be looked out for

  nina hesitated and in that instant
schaffer cried out if you say so i
nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox 

can take her in charge and you can ap-
pear against her in court sir thats
legal enough

  he fired the last few words at aimes
she will sue you for heavy damages
if you cause her arrest and prove noth-
ing against her warned aimes
arrest her snapped duke

  you are interfering with an officer
in the discharge of his duty said
schaffer to aimes grinning

 aimes slowly put down the gun
knox followed suit

 search her advised duke as
schaffer put his hand on ninas shoul-
der thats permissible now that shes
under arrest isnt it

right you are admitted schaffer
mr neece begged nina desper-
ately clinging to the bundle that schaf-
fer was endeavoring to wrest from her
can we do nothing cried knox
aimes shrugged neece had turned
pale he was staring fixedly into space
schaffer gained the box and knelt down
with it attempting to untie the knot it
opposed him

  here cut it cried the house de-
tective offering a pocketknife

  mr schaffer cut the cord that cro-
gan had tied so carefully and removed
the brown wrapping paper the red
leather case was revealed

  thats it cried duke angrily i
recognize it

  schaffer pressed the spring and lifted
the lid there lay the ruby ornaments
gleaming flashing scintillating upon
their nest of soft white satin

  i thought so cried schaffer tri-
umphantly these are the missing
jewels arent they

  they are declared duke firmly
their presence here can mean only one
thing-that the woman is guilty and
that these men are implicated arrest
then all on my charge of burglary
knox gasped and stared in horror at
aimes aimes frowned

 just phone for a wagon said

schaffer to the house detective and
some cuffs

  you are letting yourself in for a
nice mess said aimes to duke i
warn you

  duke made no answer neece drew
near to aimes

  good god it will go hard with me
if im taken he whispered im
hardly out you know 

  cant we fight our way whispered
knox imagine if this gets out-if

they get my name-

  youd better notify your sister
said aimes to neece her explana-
tion is the only thing that can set mat-
ters straight

   cant he answered hoarsely i
promised id not betray her i cant
but shell explain when she hears
protested aimes and we will be com-
pelled to make some explanation were
sure to be recognized either knox
or i

  you cant tell the story i told you
you cant tell the truth you gave me
your word not to answered neece
you can tell anything you like but the
truth

aimes looked dubiously at knox
lets fight our way out said knox
again weve both got guns you
can put the lights out with one shot
and we can head for the door

  and be taken in the hall waiting
for the lift or be compelled to hurt
somebody no there must be some
other way ill think of something

  the door was shut and the house
detective was leaning against it with
a revolver in his hand as aimes fin-
ished speaking there sounded a knock
upon the panel schaffer at the tele-
phone calling central office looked
around

  whos there he cried anxiously

  whos there repeated the house
detective


peoples

  let me in please-hurry hurry
came in a womans voice

  neece threw up his head sharply and
listened duke leaped for the door dis-
placing the house detective with small
politeness and threw it open

  antoinette he cried

  a woman was standing there a tall
slender strikingly beautiful woman-
or rather girl-for she could not have
been much more than twenty-one or
two she was gowned in white satin
very simply the soft gleaming material
depending upon the lines of her figure
to set it off her arms throat and
shoulders were bare save for the cloak
of royal purple that she had thrown
about her it was edged with white fox
against the chill and dampness of the
early spring

  she had dark hair this girl very dark
hair and a great deal of it but it was
dressed most simply her eyes were
dark too and wistful and she had a
really wonderful mouth all curves

  george she whispered with a lit-
tle catch in her breath for just an in-
stant she remained motionless on the
threshold bewildered frightened una-
ble to decide what she must do then
advancing straight to her husbands
arms she added youve heard

  her glance sweeping the room as she
advanced had discovered nina and
neece and the house detective with a
gun and the casket of rubies on the
floor

 heard what asked duke curi-
ously

  she stared up at him puzzled neece
spoke

  hes heard nothing and hes ar-
rested the lot of us for stealing the
rubies-me nina and these two gentle-
men who are friends of mine

  antoinette duke turned to him

  you didnt explain

  no answered neece

  she raised wistful eyes to her hus-
bands face

  i have something to tell you some-
thing important she said send away
your men

 is it something about the jewels
he asked staring from neece to his
wife

  yes answered antoinette duke
softly

  duke turned to schaffer and the
house detective

  you can wait outside he said as
they departed reluctantly he added
the others are-were here when 
came ninawas here with them i
have no idea who they are perhaps
you know since you appear to know
this one

  she glanced from knox to aimes

  your friends did you say she
asked neece

  he nodded

  you can speak before them if you
like i confided in them i had to but
let me say this before you begin any-
thing that you tell him will be accept-
able to me 

  i am going to tell him the truth
answered mrs duke there must be
an end to mysteries once and for all
time

  duke had been listening impatiently
now he drew nearer to his wife ask-
ing

  what is the meaning of all this
ann who is this man

  my brother answered his wife
softly

  your brother but i thought you
let me believe that you were alone in
the world and his name is neece

  so was mine rightly when you mar-
ried me the other was just a stage
name i chose i was bom ann neece
i changed it because of a misfortune
that befell my brother and made the
name of neece-undesirable when
you fell in love with me i did not tell
you this because i was afraid

  afraid repeated duke curiously

  afraid it might make a difference
nocturnal adventures of mr nicholas knox 

to you  afraid i might lose you i loved
you too much to risk that

  duke drew her close and murmured
antoinette 

  she threw her arms around his neck
youll never know how i have suf-
fered because of this secret ive had
no real peace since we married for fear
something would happen to reveal the
truth ive lived in hourly dread of
your finding out

 what that you had a brother
and that your name wasnt terrel
no the reason behind my change
of name

 the reason  duke turned and
glanced at neece the latter was stand-
ing with folded arms his head dropped
forward dukes eyes wandered on to
knox and aimes they were standing
together in the window embrasure
both looked anxious

  what was the reason asked duke
uneasily

  he was bank cashier and he used
money that was not his answered
ann duke made no sound nor did he
release the woman he held in his arms

  he did it went on ann because
my mother was ill and needed things
we could not afford to get her any other
way and afterward-when she died-
he gave himself up and took his pun-
ishment instead of trying to escape so
-so to me-there has always been
something-heroic about it all but-
but i couldnt expect you to see it as i
saw it nobody else saw it so at the
time i was afraid you wouldnt marry
me and i loved you i knew you were
proud of your name and your position
in society i knew your family would
object-even more than they did-if it
all came out so i hid it from you
when he came out of that dreadful
place i didnt let you know i came to
his rooms here to see him instead of
having him come to me and when i
found him weak and ill-nourished and

pale i had to manage some way to get
him money to go west and begin again
for your sake i didnt want him near
us so-i pawned the rubies i didnt
think you would miss them

  you pawned them

  yes whispered the woman wearily
i thought i could save up enough to
get them out before you suspected he
was going to start life again on the three
thousand i raised and he was not even
going to write to me but the very day
after wed pawned them your mother
came and got to talking about rubies
you asked me to show her mine i
didnt know what to do-how to ex-
plain in desperation i suggested that
they might have been stolen and then
you insisted upon getting in detectives
and i knew there was nothing for it
but to take the money from kenney
again and get them out and pretend
that they were mislaid thats what
kenneys been doing to-night and thats
why i sent nina here she knew all
along

 duke glanced at nina who was
standing meekly at the farthest end of
the room

  poor nina how hardly ive used
her he said

  as she went down the street to-
night added ann i was watching
from the window and i saw two men
follow her and i was afraid they might
find the rubies on her so i came too i
think-thats all

  duke drew her closer and kissed her
lips

  if ever i doubted your devotion he
said you have given me proof to-
night

you forgive me she sobbed softly
i have nothing to forgive except the
fact that you denied me your confidence
ill forgive you that if you promise not
to let it happen again

   never will she promised and
-kenney

  duke turned to smile at neece who
was waiting in fearful anxiety

  well take care of kenney said
duke

  the detectives were dismissed knox
and aimes were introduced and their
parts in the whole affair explained
they were thanked quite thoroughly by
duke and mrs duke and by kenneth
neece even by nina who never tired
of telling afterward of mr aimes
bravery in a perfectly respectful way
she worshiped him forever and never
thought of him in any other attitude
than that of a gallant defender gun in
hand

  it was nearer two than one oclock
when finally mr knox and mr aimes
parted from the others before the duke
house and went on up the avenue on
foot the moon was out the stars
too the electricity in the air that
urges one on to adventure when the
night is young had been dissipated
the peace of coming dawn was already
evident although dawn was still some
hours away

  i shall sleep to-night without rock-
ing observed mr knox and without
books magazines chess or solitaire
im actually tired out and no wonder

it seems like a month since we started
out adventuring

  doesnt it agreed mr aimes
something doing makes time pass
quickly and there have been things
doing to-night

  mr knox nodded and sighed con-
tentedly

  we shall not fare so well every
night though he observed we
couldnt that would be too good
nonsense answered aimes its
entirely up to us and the person whose
wish we choose to grant we did grant
neeces to-night you know

  thats right agreed knox we
surely did

  if we keep on at this rate added
aimes the world will be a lot better
for our adventuring and that is satis-
faction enough for any man

 they had come to fifty-seventh
street the parting of the ways

  good night said knox holding
out his hand youll dine with me to-
morrow at seven

  ill lunch with you at one and well
look up that apartment we spoke about
right cried knox contentedly
until to-morrow at one then 

  they parted and the night swallowed
them both

for the last three seasons esmond had been changing his method
in the box and now the change was complete he no longer relied
at all on speed a fast ball when he pitched it at all was mixed in
simply to baffle the batters he depended now on his control on
his ability to make the ball break as he pleased to cut the corners

when the eagles began their
final dash for the pennant in
september they were in a po-
sition to join the hot race to the wire
because of the pitching of marty es-
mond marty had been pitching for the
eagles for nine years and for a couple
of seasons sporting cartoonists had pic-
tured him with white locks and a cane
hobbling into the box he was exactly
thirty years old according to the rec-
ords in the family bible but in league
baseball he was a veteran of veterans
not a man on the team now playing as
a regular had been with the club when
marty pitched his first game pie was
the one survivor of manager pat du-
gans first championship nine

  up to the middle of september in
that year marty had pitched twenty-
five games for the eagles of these
he had won seventeen and six of the
eight he had lost had been decided
against him in april and may the
spring had been cold and rainy and a
veteran pitcher like esmond needs
clear hot days to be at his best a hot
sun to bake out his muscles young
pitchers do well enough in arctic
weather the old-timers dread the days
when the stands are sparsely filled with
shivering fans in overcoats and the
coachers at first and third wrap them-
selves warmly in sweaters or macki-
naws

  it looked in the first weeks of that


peoples

season as if esmond was going back
as if be had about come to the end of
his usefulness as an eagle pitcher for-
tunately however for the teams stand-
ing in the race appearances were mis-
leading with the coming of real
weather in june he -began to pitch
seemingly as well as ever

  but it was a different sort of pitch-
ing for the last three seasons esmond
had been changing his method in the
box and now the change was complete
he no longer relied at all on speed a
fast ball when he pitched it at all was
mixed in simply to baffle the batters
he depended now on his control on
his ability to make the ball break as he
pleased to cut the corners when the
eagles bad a safe lead he served up
balls that were easy to hit trusting to
his fielders to cut off hard drives set-
tling down to pitch only when there
were men on bases and there was a real
and absolute necessity for him to give
of his best

  pat dugan knew that esmond was
going back charley greene now his
regular catcher knew it but no one
except himself knew the agony that
esmond endured during and after every
game the shooting pains that did not
disappear from upper-arm and shoulder
muscles for several hours after the last
ball was pitched despite the expert min-
istrations of sam jackson the prince
of rubbers

  every day before he pitched marty
submitted himself to sam and the mus-
cles of arm and shoulder were rubbed
and kneaded until they were soft and
pliable but they tightened up under
the strain of actual pitching and every
night as sam pounded and rubbed and
kneaded and pulled marty swore that
nothing would induce him to go through
the pain and torment again but he
knew even as he made that resolution
that he would keep on just as he knew
that this was his last season the stiff-
ening that would come in the long win-

  ter meant the end the hot days of
the texas spring had rejuvenated him
for the last time next year he would be
unable to pitch

  so when this season was over he
would have to quit and his one purpose
now was to help the eagles into an-
other worlds series

  it wasnt ambition alone that made
marty so keen to get into one more
worlds series of course he wanted
to wind up his career on the diamond
in a blaze of that sort of glory but
more than the glory he wanted-and
needed-the extra money even a los-
ing share of worlds series receipts
meant a check for about two thousand
dollars a winners share might be half
as much again it was on that check
which hadnt yet been earned that es-
mond had to depend for a new start
in life he hadnt saved a cent hadnt
been able to 

  except for the anxiety he felt as
to his future esmond took the inevi-
table and inexorably approaching end
of his career as an eagle calmly enough
he wasnt sorry for himself ball play-
ers as a rule know about bow long they
may expect to remain in fast company
they are sorry to leave it they are
sorry to see friends slow up and go to
the minors but they dont regard such
things as tragic certain authors to the
contrary notwithstanding most of
them nowadays have a comfortable
nest egg laid up for the days when they
have to leave the bench and a good
many spend their winters building up
a business that they can step into when
their playing days are over even the
improvident ones can as a rule de-
pend upon from two to five extra years
in good minor leagues where the pay
is smaller but is still big enough to
give them time to get ready for other
work

  esmond unfortunately wasnt so
lucky when he stopped pitching for
the eagles it would be because he


marty esmonds arm



  wasnt physically able to pitch at all
any more not because he had lost just
that fine bit of added skill that makes
the difference between a major leaguer
and a minor-league star

  the final month of the pennant race
that year developed into a wild nerve-
racking drive with the eagles and the
kites both in the hunt to the very end
pat dugan a veritable genius of the
game grew thin under the strain he
confided to esmond and one or two
others that he was losing a lot of sleep
on the bench he was like a wild man
errors that were made with the hands
he could forgive slow thinking wrong
thinking resulting in what ball play-
ers call a bone-head play drove him
mad

  he lashed hisyoung players unmer-
cifully with his tongue when they went
wrong he had to as he saw it to
come into the stretch with a chance for
the pennant they had to play just a
little bit better than they knew how
and only dugan knew how much de-
pended on their success let them win
this year and they would be confident
irresistible for two or three more sea-
sons but if they lost they would lose
more than a pennant-they would lose
he knew the chance to be transformed
from a squad of promising players into
one of those great baseball machines
that stand out in the history of the
game

  the youngsters on the team didnt
mind the abuse they were dazzled by
the glamour of actually being in a real
pennant fight but marty esmond had
as much at stake in his way as dugan
himself his nerves were just as
stretched and taut as dugans own and
when the manager called him down pub-
licly for mistakes in pitching mistakes
that were due to the imperative neces-
sity of saving his arm esmond grew
hot and sullen in ordinary times he
and dugan liked one another but these
were not ordinary times

  then with less than a week of the
race left the climax came both the
kite and the eagles were playing
out the season against second-division
teams if both clubs won all their
games the eagles would win the pen-
nant by a single half game the stand-
ing then would be eagles won 
lost  pc  kites won  lost
 pc  there was a postponed
game that the eagles couldnt play off
but if the eagles lost one of the half
dozen games that remained and the
kites won all of theirs the kites would
win the pennant for the percentage of
the eagles would drop to 

  every game counted none was more
important than another but it hap-
pened that circumstances gave a ficti-
tious importance to a saturday affair in
which marty esmond pitched the
stands were packed even the fact that
the tail-end reds were playing couldnt
keep the crowds away at such a crisis
the reds turned loose a young pitcher
who was the sensation of the whole
league one schultz who had joined
the reds too late to improve their stand-
ing but was full of promise for suc-
ceeding years he had beaten every
team in the league the last time the
eagles had faced him they had made
two hits and no runs in the first in-
ning errors behind schultz gave the
eagles a run marty realized that it
was strictly up to him to protect that
lead since the chances were all against
any more scoring off schultz

  so for eight innings he bent all his
cunning all his deep knowledge of the
art of pitching to the task inning
after inning the eagles went up swing-
ing wildly at the fancy shoots and daz-
zling speed of schultz inning after
inning too the reds though they hit
esmond hard though they had men on
the bases almost every time tried vainly
to get the hit that would drive home
a run or two in the pinch marty baf-
fled them every time he worked a con-


peoples

slant change of pace when there were
men on the bases at all other times
he let them hit the ball depending on
the fielding stars who backed him up
this much he could do he could de-
termine almost exactly where the ball
should be hit and whenever he pitched
a straight ball he turned deliberately
and gave the signal to keohan the sec-
ond baseman who in turn signaled to
the other fielders to shift and cover
the threatened spot

  thanks to martys strategy the
score when the eagles took the fieid for
the ninth inning was still one to noth-
ing three more outs and the game
would be won the eagles would not
have to face schultz again this season
no other pitcher they might have to
meet would begin to be so dangerous

  suddenly in the ninth inning every-
thing went wrong the first man up
hit to keohan the ball coming easily
took a bad bounce and shot over his
shoulder for a lucky single the next
man sacrificed burns on first base
coming in for a quick play at second
threw just too late to get the runner
and both men were safe the third
batter swinging wildly trying to knock
the ball out of the park topped it and
the demon of bad luck turned the hit
into one of those slow-rolling sneaky
bounders that are impossible to field
three men raced for it together by
the time keohan got it the bases were
full with none out

  anything would tie the score now-
a long fly a short single marty grinned
at keohan as he took the ball walked
slowly back to the box and stared con-
templatively at hammond the next
batter who crouched menacingly at the
plate he had pitched hard that day
his shoulder was on fire with quick
stabbing pains that shot up through
his neck to the back of his head du-
gan on the bench stared at him ap-
pealingly then with three pitched
balls marty struck hammond out

while the crowd raised a pjean of de-
light again he paused and then was
startled by another cry from the crowd
a welling shout made up of derision
and delight he turned and looked at
the scoreboard to see a great five posted
for the terriers in their game with the
kites-in the ninth inning he smiled
and relaxed the kites had lost that
meant that the eagles could drop this
game and still have a chance but then
as he looked the score for the kites
went up-a staring six token of a rally
that had won the game for them after
all

  he pitched to the next batter ball
one again another ball he tried a
curve ball three the ball had re-
fused to break the pain in his shoul-
der had redoubled in intensity it
seemed to him that he could not pitch
another ball dugan came running out
marty welcomed the respite

  youve got to give him curves said
dugan tensely even if you walk him
dont let him hit it if he walks you
force in a run but weve still got a
chance to keep the score tied dont
let him hit it

  once more marty pitched this time
he curved the ball his shoulder mus-
cles shrieked as he achieved the task
strike one then he knew suddenly
that he could pitch no more curves he
must depend on the team behind him
at his signal greene came out anx-
iously

  cant help it growled marty im
going to give him a fast one on the
inside he ought to hit it to keohan
for a double play

  straight and true the ball flew for the
plate the batter lunged forward the
ball a white streak cut the grass a foot
beyond keohans outstretched fingers
a clean hit to center two runs were
in  dugan raving like a madman tore
into the diamond

  get off the field he screamed at
marty you threw the game-and the
marty esmonds arm



pennant most likely whats the mat-
ter-you got money up on the kites 

  another pitcher came in he retired
the reds with one more run but the
mischief was done marty had not fin-
ished dressing when the eagles dis-
couraged disgusted sullen in defeat
poured into the clubhouse without hav-
ing been able even to get a man to first
in their half of the ninth and there
he and dugan growled and spat at one
another like two angry cats dugan full
of anger at martys disobedience es-
mond resenting dugans insinuation
with all the strength that was in him
he might have guessed that it had been
only a hasty taunt that dugan himself
had probably forgotten it by now but
the words rankled left him furious
as without waiting for jacksons rub-
down he made his way to the street

  if marty had told dugan the truth
about his arm there would have been
no trouble but he couldnt bring him-
self to do that somehow even though
he knew that his pitching days were
over he still hoped against hope that the
winters rest might work some miracle
that the spring would see him restored
to some measure of his former ability
this was foolish no doubt but certainly
it was human

  that night he paid for his neglect to
submit to sam jacksons rubbing the
pain in his arm and shoulder kept him
awake in the morning it was not much
better he went to a doctor who knew
him of course and didnt try to hide
his surprise and interest

  ill be frank mr esmond he said
it doesnt look very good it may be
neuritis-it may be just a temporary
affection of the muscles id prescribe
a complete rest electrical treatment-
perhaps mud baths and such things at
some spa oh you neednt shake your
head im not going to prescribe at
all im going to do something highly
unprofessional-send you to an osteo-
path i dont say he can cure you but

he ll help the pain and he cant do you
any harm

  osteopath eh said marty ilow
much will he soak me doc

  what do you care asked doctor
emerson quickly too quickly if marty
had been in a noticing mood we all
know the sort of salaries you fellows
get

  oh well  marty flushed im no
pauper exactly but a lot of that talk
about big salaries is bunk doc you
dont want to believe everything those
baseball reporters write

  well dont worry advised emer-
son kammer wont charge you too
much and itll be worth it give him
this card

  esmond had just happened to visit
emerson he knew no doctors except
the club physician and he had purposely
avoided him emersons sign was the
first he saw after he left his hotel and
that had controlled his choice one
doctor he thought would do as well
as another had he asked for an opin-
ion as to emerson from those qualified
to give it he would have heard nothing
against the doctors professional skill
but he might have heard some of the
stories about him that were current sto-
ries of his rather lurid outbreaks amid
the white lights of the city of his inti-
macy with certain gamblers probably
this would have made no difference
however marty might have felt and
justly that emerson could act as he
pleased without affecting his ability to
heal a sore arm

  doctor kammer the osteopath diag-
nosed the trouble with martys arm
quickly enough

  you must not pitch again this sea-
son he said if you do-that will
almost certainly be the end if you
rest now and submit to treatment you
may have an arm next spring as good
as it was five years ago i do not think
you will but you may and it is certain
that you can then do some pitching but


peoples

if you abuse your arm any more now
if you subject it to any great strain
you may have very serious trouble-
trouble so serious that you will not be
able to write to do the most ordinary
tilings which arms are for now i will
give you a treatment that will relieve
your pain

  marty left kammers office in a
thoughtful mood he took little stock
in the suggestion that he might be able
to pitch another season or so no mat-
ter what doctors said down in the bot-
tom of his heart he knew but about
taking a rest now he would almost
certainly be called on for one more
game and if the kites happened to
lose another game and so let the eagles
into the worlds series after all he
would pitch one game at least of the
big series the way his arm felt now
he could do it too why couldnt he
have a treatment from kammer every
day and take the chance

  relief from pain helped his mental
attitude he worried less about the fu-
ture something would turn up he
had lots of friends he ought to land
a good job even without the big
worlds series check to tide him over
he decided to spend the rest of his
sunday in the country he wanted to
forget baseball for a while anyhow

  when he came back he dropped off
a trolley car outside his hotel he
didnt intend to go in though it was the
unofficial headquarters of the eagles
but three eagles spying him rushed
out slapped him on the back and
dragged him into the lobby there a
meeting of jubilation was in full prog-
ress with ball players fans and all
and sundry taking part the incred-
ible had come to pass the kites had
dropped two games of a double-header
that sunday afternoon in their home
town in the west they had cracked
under the strain the disaster was due
it might well be to overconfidence the
result of the eagles defeat of the pre-

vious day now the eagles had their
margin again they could even afford
to lose another game and still win the
pennant for the first time in weeks
pat dugan was smiling he greeted
esmond jovially

  hello- there marty old boy he
said some news what say for-
get that panning  handed you yester-
day it was pretty raw but i didnt
mean a word of it really

  but marty was not to be so easily
appeased his look was still sullen

  i guess you meant it right enough
be said and i guess youd still be
meaning it if the kites had won those
games to-day

  dugan looked black for a moment
then he grinned

  chase yourself off to bed marty
lie said youre tired old boy well
take it easy ill save you this week-
so youll be right for the big series
well be depending on you for that
you know

  marty went off glowering so far as
he could know his meeting with doctor
emerson just outside of the hotel was
the result of pure chance

  well hows the arm kammer fix
it up asked the doctor

  sure feels great said esmond
shortly

  say i heard about the roasting you
got yesterday emerson continued he
passed his arm through martys in
friendly fashion rough stuff that
use you all up and then pan you when
you were suffering torture every time
you threw a ball

  the sympathetic note got an instant
response from marty he was just in
the mood to be confidential he liked
his associates on the team well enough
but he was a survivor of an older gen-
eration these youngsters had their
own friendships naturally he had had
his intimates in the past and they were
scattered now some were in the mi-
nors  some had quit the game alto-
marty esmonds arm



gether there was no one to whom he
could unburden himself consequently
before he quite realized what he was
doing he was telling emerson every-
thing

  gad thats tough-it certainly is
said the doctor i guess we outsiders
get to thinking you ball players all have
it easy but whod ever think a club
like the eagles would treat you so
theyd turn you off next spring you
say if your arm was gone

  oh sure  why not 

  they ought to do something for
you youve made thousands for the
club why its because of you that
theyre practically sure to get into the
worlds series how about the series
wholl win it 

  we will-on the dope said esmond
promptly the oddsll be on us too
im good for one winning game young
bentley ought to win twice and the
rest of the staff can pull us through
once among the lot of them the her-
ons win in their league because they
got so far ahead at the start no one
could catch them but theyve gone
bad the last few weeks their pitch-
ers arc on the bum and spike mallo
out with a broken leg

  thats right said emerson thought-
fully i heard the betting would be
about three to one on the eagles some
chance for a clean-up-if they lost
dont you worry any about our los-
ing said esmond if we beat out
the kites we should worry about the
herons theyre not in our class-
not the way theyve been shot to pieces
i suppose not but just the same
theres no law against thinking about
what a clean-up there could be if any
one fixed it for the eagles to lose is
there 

  their eyes met and in that moment
esmond began to understand neither
of them said anything but the pitchers
eyes were the first to fall he knew
now what was in emersons mind and

he saw a way to end his diamond career
with a small fortune instead of just
enough to give him a start after all
the receipts his share of a worlds se-
ries could not be figured in advance
bad weather any one of a dozen rea-
sons might cut down attendance the
thought was planted in his mind at all
events

  i saw kammer said emerson with
seeming irrelevance he says he told
you not to pitch again

  thats all he knows said esmond
ive got to get in on that series

  but suppose your arm went bad dur-
ing a game that might happen

  sure-it might

  emerson was wise he said nothing
more they parted but marty was
not suqrised when he learned from the
clerk of the hotel in answer to his dis-
creet questions that emerson numbered
among his patients some of the biggest
gamblers in town including one man
who had tried to start a nation-wide
weekly pool on the standing of the big-
league clubs a scheme that had been
broken up by the national commission
which knew that the taint of gambling
once it affected baseball would kill the
game as it had killed horse-racing in
almost every state in the union

  in the middle of that week the kites
dropped another game and the eagles
clinched the pennant even if they lost
the rest of their contests at once
worlds series talk dominated the city
there was a good deal of betting in
a small way the odds as emerson
had heard they would favored the
eagles they had passed successfully
through their great crisis and the con-
sensus of expert opinion favored them
now over the herons

  dugan the pennant once won became
his normal genial self he did every-
thing he could to encourage his team
of youngsters he wanted them to go
against the herons full of confidence


peoples

in themselves convinced that they were
unbeatable the result as a matter of
fact did not greatly worry him he
expected his team to win but he knew
that he could accept defeat with equa-
nimity provided they made a good
showing this of course before the
first game after the series had once
begun he would be after victory ham-
mer and tongs that was dugan he
conldnt let up once the fight was on

  as for marty esmond he saw the
day for the first game approaching with
mingled uncertain feelings his own
injuries as he saw them dominated
him emerson had worked skillfully on
his feelings he couldnt forget du-
gans accusation he had done his best
and as a reward bad been publicly ac-
cused of throwing a game if he was
going to be suspected why shouldnt
he get something out of it why
shouldnt he feather his own nest if
he had the chance the club to which
he had given the best years of his life
-the loyalty of nine years-to which
finally he had sacrificed his greatest as-
set his pitching arm would cast him
off without a thought as soon as he
could no longer serve it

 emerson knew that marty would
think along those lines he met him
seemingly by accident every evening
on the day before the first game of
the great series he struck home

  a lot of my friends are lined up
he said theyve got this series doped
out its going to run to six or seven
games youll pitch the deciding game
if they know youre with us theyll put
up a lot of money tf they win therell
be five thousand in it for you you
can pitch good winning ball in the first
game thatll only lengthen the odds

  how would i be sure of getting the
money asked marty

  itll be put in a safe-deposit box
if the eagles lose you can get the key
from tim casey you know him hes
held a good many hundred thousands of

dollars in stakes hell never squeal
either what do you say

  they were in front of esmonds ho-
tel and at that moment the demon of
mischance sent pat dugan by on the
other side of the street he saw es-
mond and came over

  just a minute marty he said he
led him away whats the matter with
you  he asked are you plumb
crazy letting yourself be seen with that
crook hes mixed up with gamblers
why if some of the newspaper boys
saw you with him theyd swear you
were rigging up a plant

  yeh  an i suppose theyd remember
what you said to me  the field 
flamed marty i suppose you think
im crooked

  i think youre a damned fool-thats
all  snapped dugan and turned on his
heel

  esmond went back to the doctor in
a white rage he had made up his
mind to turn down the offer but now 
im with you lie said

  he wouldnt let any man talk to him
as dugan had hed show them by
j iminy 

  the next day the big series began
pat dugan crossed the predictions of all
the newspaper writers by sending young
bentley to the mound instead of es-
mond the old master

  im going to save you marty he
said your arm wont stand the work
but-youve still got the headpiece i
want to keep you like an ace in the hole
for a pinch this series is going to be
close if she runs to seven games youll
pitch the last one-see or any time
we need one game to win the big money
you pitch it

  marty listened sullenly he didnt
believe dugan he thought the man-
ager distrusted him and he was more
than ever convinced that dugan had
meant his taunt on that disastrous sat-
urday

  my arms all right now he growled
marty esmonds arm



ive been having an osteopath man-
handle it every day-

  sure its all right keep it so said
dugan youll have use for it these
birds are going to fight all the way
that worlds series was destined to go
down as a classic it was a fight from
the first inning of the first game the
eagles took that the herons came right
back in the second and tied up the se-
ries then the teams jumped west
and broke even again in the heron
stronghold but despite the closeness
of the fight the attendance in those first
four games was disappointing the
herons came from a small city that was
not in any case a good baseball town
and threatening weather had kept a lot
of people away marty scowled as be
read the receipts the winners share
would be less than twenty-five hundred
dollars apiece for it is in the receipts
of the first four games only that the
players share

  back east went the teams the her-
ons won the fifth game another jump
the eagles tied up the series that
made a seventh game necessary and
the toss of a coin brought it to the home
of the eagles

  he wont let me pitch-he was
only stringing me thought esmond to
himself but in the train on the way
home dugan told him quietly that he
depended upon him the newspapers
announced that he was to pitch on
the morning of the last game before
he had finished dressing emerson
knocked at his door

  well its up to you he said the
whole rolls down on the herons
get out growled marty you
neednt remind me

  the rest of nearly two weeks and the
constant treatments by kammer had
made his arm feel as good as new but
that morning when he went to the os-
teopath for a final treatment kammer
scowled

  are you going to pitch he asked

marty nodded well itll spoil all ive
done for you youll be lucky if you
can finish the game he went into
the reasons for what he said marty
got some vague notion of certain liga-
ments and tendons still too weak to
bear the strain of pitching he only
smiled they would furnish a fine
alibi

  he warmed up easily before the
game just tossing the ball then he
began to pitch with an ease a freedom
from effort he had not known all sea-
son ferber the heron star opposed
him he had won two games already
shutting the eagles out in one and al-
lowing a single run in the second he
was young as big as all outdoors and
seemingly without a nerve in his body
for six innings he and marty indulged
in as pretty a pitching duel as the most
rabid enthusiast could ask for

  ill let em get a run-thatll be
enough thought marty well never
score on this bird

  in the seventh marty himself who
was proverbial for bis weak batting
even among pitchers swung wildly at
one of ferbers shoots and lifted it into
the right-field stand for the fiukiest of
home runs the whole team slapped
him on the back grasped his hand as
he came to the bench and the crowd
went mad but marty saw emerson
scowling from a box right behind the
eagle bench he dared not recognize
the doctor but surely any one must
know what an accidental hit that had
been

  in the eighth inning his arm began
to trouble him he stopped curving the
ball and sent it up straight but though
ringing drives left the herons bats
martys fielders performed prodigies
behind him two hits went safe but
little keohan with two men on the
bases flew over toward third speared
a screaming liner dropped back on sec-
ond for the second out and shot the
ball to first in time for a triple play


peoples

it was sheer robbery carson who had
hit the ball had been entitled to a three-
bagger perhaps a home run

  got a horseshoe in that glove
asked dugan when marty went to the
bench

  why dont you send bergman in if
you dont like the way im pitching
snapped marty bergman had spent
the afternoon in center field tossing a
few balls now and then to be ready in
case of need but dugan said nothing
more only stared hard at marty who
turned to the water cooler for a drink

  then came the ninth inning the
crowd was roaring marty turned as
he went to the box and caught a glimpse
of emersons strained white face it
was the last chance his arm was sore
now constant twinges warned him that
kammer had been right in about two
minutes he changed the whole aspect
of the game he passed the first man
the next bunted and marty messed up
the simple task of throwing him out so
that two men were on the bases then
trying to catch the man on first he
threw low to burns and both runners
advanced that spoiled the chance for
a double play on the next ball pitched
keohan getting a slow ball held it so
long to keep the man on third from
scoring that the bases were full

  take him out roared the crowd in
unison and from the bench came du-
gan beckoning to marty they met
just off the diamond

  marty im on to you said dugan
youre trying to throw this game
youve done it-because you know
bergman isnt good enough to stop em
with the bases full hes no good after
a man gets on youre the only man
weve got that can still win this
game-

  my arm began marty dugans
calm pitying tone upset him he couldnt
bluster somehow

  i know said dugan marty-
youre going to stay in im going to

trust to you-to the man thats been my
chief reliance for nine years im going
to tell you something you havent known
-or any of the boys this is my last
game in uniform im through to-day
youve started to throw this game-
but im going to trust to you to come
back and be the white man youve al-
ways been before

  he turned away quickly and went
back to the bench

  pat called marty pat-

  he got no answer dazed wonder-
ing he went back and faced the batter
the howling mob in the stands dugan
trusted him and all at once the enor-
mity of what he had agreed to do the
blackness of his treachery came over
him he knew he couldnt do it all
those nine years of loyalty to dugan to
the great game swept over him he
set his teeth dugan was right he
and he alone could still save the day-
if his arm lasted

  then he began to pitch not for three
years had he used such speed such con-
summate skill the first batter watched
three balls cut the corners of the plate
and was out on strikes for the sec-
ond remembering his weakness marty
pitched a drop a ball that involved an
awful tearing of his shoulder muscles
but he had his reward the batter
struck lost the ball on the drop and
sent it straight up in the air to fall
into greenes big mitt for the second
out

  but now great beads of sweat stood
out on martys forehead for a mo-
ment the pain in his shoulder made him
dizzy so that black spots danced before
his eyes one man to get and his arm
was going it was the crisis of which
kammer had warned him the nails
of his left hand bit into the flesh and
drew blood he shot over a swift
strike seeing the batter out of position
then a curve a wide sweeping ball
that broke and came in after the batter
had decided to let it pass two strikes
marty esmonds arm



-two out he was in agony he had
one ball left his old fast ball with a
fast rise but he had not used it since
early in july even then the strain had
been too much to pitch it now meant
he knew the breaking of those over-
strained ligaments but then as the
base runners all started he pitched it
the batter swung-missed it by a foot
the game was over-the eagles were
champions of the world but marty es-
monds arm bung numb and useless by
his side

  the club doctor lifted it in the club-
house-looked grave

  youll be able to use it-but not to
pitch he said you finished it in that
last inning

  never mind said dugan crisply
marty come here he took him
aside marty i was onto that business
with emerson but-i knew you you
made good marty im quitting to be
president of the club ive bought the
stock therell be a new manager-
and his name will be marty esmond

theres a deal of poetry an story-tellin in books but lor bless
ye if ye could see the heart right through of even such men as me
youd have no need o books when you wanted poetry and romance

we was just standin here at about
eleven in the evenin an the
moon was beginnin to rise
we could see the little patch of light
growin bigger an bigger just as it is
now an we knew that before many
moments the light would be up over the
sea my back was to the sea an bill
was leanin agin the handrail just like
you now

  it aint much sir after all leastwise
to you but it was aye an it is a deal
to me for it has all my life in it such
as it is theres a deal of poetry an
story-tellin in books but lor bless ye
if ye could see the heart right through
of even such men as me youd have no
need o books when you wanted poetry
and romance i often think that them
chaps in them dont feel a bit more nor
we do when things is happenin its
only when theyre written down that
they become heroes an martyrs an
suchlike why bill was as big a hero
as any of them i often wished as how

i could write that i might tell all about
him

  ilowsumdever if i cant write i can
talk an if youre not in a hurry anll
wait till i tell you al ill be proud it
does me good to talk about bill

  well when i turned round an faced
bill i see his eyes with the light in em
an they was glistenin bill gives a big
gulp an says to me

  joe the worlds a big place big
enough for you an me to live in with-
out quarrelin an mayhap the same
god as made one woman would make
another an we might both live an be
happy you an me has been comrades
for long an god knows that next to
mary id be sad to see you die so what-
ever comes we wont quarrel or think
hard of one another sure we wont
joe

  he put out his hand an i took it sud-
den we held hands for a long time
i thought he was in low spirits and i
wished to cheer him so i says


peoples

  why bill who talks o dyin thats
as hearty as we

  he shook his head sadly an says
he

  joe i dont vally my life at a pins
head an i aint afraid to die for her
sake or for yours-aye even for her

pleasure-id-- no matter just see

if i turn coward if i ever get the chance
to do her a service

  well we stood there for a long time
neither of us said a word for i didnt
like to speak although i would several
times have liked to ask him a question
an then i gave up wishin to speak an
began to think like him

  i thought of all the time bill an me
had been friends an comrades an how
fond we were both of mary an she of
us ye see when we was all children
the little thing took such a fancy for
both of us that we couldnt help likin
her for it and so we became in course
of time like big brothers to her she
would come down on the shore with
bill an me an sit quiet all the day an
never say a word or do anything to an-
noy us or put us out sometimes wed
go out sailin an then she would come
an sit beside whoever was steerin till
hed ask her to come up an sit on his
knee then shed put up her little arms
round his neck an kiss him an would
stay as quiet as a mouse till shed have
to change her place that was the way
sir that we both came to be so fond
of her

  an sure enough when she began to
grow up bill an me wanted none other
but her an the more she grew the
prouder we were of her till at last we
found out that we were both of us in
love with her but we never told her
so or let her see it an she had grown
up so among us that she never suspected
it she said so long after

  then bill an me held a kind of coun-
cil about what was to be done an so
we came to be talkin on the bridge that
night mary was growin into a young

woman an we feared that some other
chap might take her fancy if one of
us didnt get her at once bill was very
serious far more serious than me for
i had somehow got the idea into my
head as how mary cared for me an
as long as i felt that i couldnt feel
either unhappy or downhearted

  all at once bills face grew brighter
an there was a soft look in his eyes

  joe he says whatever happens
mary must never hang her head the
lass is tender-hearted and she likes
both of us we know an as she can
only love one of us it might pain her to
think that when she was marryin one
man she was leavin a hole in the life of
his comrade so she must never know
as how we both love her if we can pre-
vent it

  when we got that far i began to
grow uneasy i began to distrust bill
-god forgive me for it-an to think
that maybe he was fixin some plan for
to cut me out i must have been jeal-
ous that was it but i was punished
for my distrust when he went on

  joe old lad we both love her an
we love each other an god knows id
go away an willin an leave her to
you but who knows that mayhap shed
like me better of the two women is
queer creatures in lettin a fellow see
their hearts till they see his first

  then he stayed quiet an so i says
to him

  how are we to manage to do that
bill if we tell her wont she know
that we both love her an you said
you wouldnt like her to do that

  thats just what i was thinkin of
he says an i see how we may do it
one of us must go to her an find out
if she loves him an if she does the
other will say nothin

  i felt feared so i asked him

  who is to go bill 

  he came over an took me by the
shoulder an says he 

  joe so far as i can see the lass
greater love



  cares for you the most you must go
  first an find out

    i tried not to appear joyful an i
  says

    bill that isnt fair whoever goes
  first has the best chance why wont
  you go or why not draw lots  ive
  had a many hard tussles in my time
  both with men an things but i never
  had such a struggle as i had to say
  them words

    joe says bill you must do all
  you can to win her yourself an dont
  let any thoughts of me hinder you ill
  be best pleased by seein her an you
  happy if so be she loves you then
  he stood up from leaning on the rail
  an says he

    joe give me your hand before we
  go an mind i charge you on your
  honor as a man never while im livin
  to let mary know as how i loved her
  in case she chooses you so i prom-
  ised i felt bills hand grip like a vise
  an then we turned an walked away
  home an never spoke another word
  that night either of us

    i didnt sleep much that night and
  when it began to get to mornin i got
  - up an went down to the sea an had a
  swim an that freshened me up some-
  what i wasnt much of a swimmer
  myself but i could manage to keep
  myself up pretty well that was the
  point where i envied bill most of all
  he was the finest swimmer i ever see
  he did a many things well an no lad
  in this county could come near him in
  anything he chose to do but in swim-
  min none could come anigh him at all
  an manys the time it stood to others
  as well as himself

    well when i had had my bathe i
  went up toward marys home an
  found myself goin in to ask her straight
  off to marry me then i began to
  think it was too early for mary to be
  up so i stole away on tiptoe an walked
  round the house then i thought id
  go an look up bill an came anigh his

house but when i came to the door
as i didnt like to knock i thought id
speer in an see if he was asleep so
i stole to he window an looked in

  i never shall forget to my dyin day
what i saw then i wasnt a bad fel-
low thank god at any time but i
couldnt be a bad fellow or do anything
i thought very wrong after that there
was bill just as i had left him the night
before he had never changed his
clothes an the candle was flickerin
down in the socket unheeded he was
kneeliu down by the bed with his arms
stretched out before him an his face
down on the quilt that was thirty-
seven year ago but it seems like yes-
terday i thought at first he was
sleepin but i saw from a movement he
made that he was awake so i stole
away guiltylike an went down an
stood beside the sea i took off my hat
an let the wind blow about my fore-
head for somehow it felt burnin an
 looked out over the sea for long
somehow my hgart beat like as if it
was lead an i felt half choked 
dunno how long i would have stayed
there only for bill he came behind
me and put his hand on my shoulder
and said sudden 	

  why joe what are you doin
here 

  i turned startled an saw that he
was smilin i was so thunderstruck
at seein the change that for a moment
i said nothin he says to me again

  joe i thought youd have more to
do than think of eatin this mornin an
its bad to court on an empty stomach 
so come up to my place ive got break-
fast for the both of us

  i couldnt realize that this hearty
chap was the man i saw prayin after
the long night i looked at him keenly
blit could see no sign of his actin a
part in his face he was gayer an live-
lier than ever an in such good spirits
that he made me gay too i couldnt
forget how fd seen him a short while


peoples

since but i laid the thought by an
didnt let it trouble me i went up to
his place it was clean an tidy as ever
an the breakfast was ready he made
me eat some an when i was done he
brushed me up an tidied me an
says be

  go in an win old lad god bless
ye i went away toward marys
house but before i lost sight of bill i
turned an he waved his hand to me
with a kind smile an went in an shut
the door

  i went on toward marys but the
farther i went the slower i got an
when i got to the garden gate i stopped
altogether i stayed moonin about
there for a whiler till at last mary sees
me an comes out i dont know how
to tell you what took place then i aint
more bashfuller than a man of my years
ought to be but somehow it comes
rough on a man to tell this kind of
thing oh no it aint that i dont
remember it all for i do well but
ye see-ye wont laugh at me i
knowd ye wouldnt i ax yer pardon
well to prove it to ye ill say what i
never said yet to mortal except mary
-an that only once

  mary comes out to me runnin like a
little girl with her face all dimplin
over with pleasure an she says

  why joe what brings you here at
this hour come in joe mother
heres joe have you had your break-
fast joe come in

  i felt that i would never have cour-
age to speak out before her mother if
i went into the cottage so i stayed
beside the gate an let her talk on as
i looked at her then i could hardly be-
lieve what i was come for it seemed
like doin something wrong to try to
change her from what she was she
looked so lovely an so bright that it
seemed a pity ever to wish her to be
aught else-even my own wife an
beside the thought came an hit me
hard that mayhap she wouldnt have

me after all i tried to think on that
but lor bless ye i couldnt it seemed
somethin so terrible that i couldnt
think it however i stood still sayin
nothin till she began to notice i
wasnt used to be sheepish before mary
or any one else so when she had done
her talkin she looked at me sudden
an then her eyes fell an after a mo-
ment she blushed up to the roots of
her hair an says

  joe whats the matter with you
you dont look as usual

  i blurted out all in a moment

  no mary nor i aint the same as
usual for im in trouble

  she came close to me before j could
say any more-she wasnt lookin down
or blushin then-an she says

  oh joe im sorry for that an
she put her arm on my shoulder then
she went on in a kind o tender voice
did you tell bill

  yes i says

  and what did he say

  he told me to come to you

  to me joe she says an looked
puzzled

  yes i says in despair like im
in trouble mary for i want you to
marry me

  oh joe she says an drew away
a little then she says to me with a
queer look on her face

  joe run an tell bill i want to see
him-to come as soon as he can

  well them words went through me
like so many knives an if ever i could
have hated bill it would have been
then what could she want bill for
 thinks to myself but to find out if
he loves her too-an to have him i
thinks how mad a woman would be to
have me when she could get a man like
bill i was afraid to say anything so i
set off smart for him for i feared i
wouldnt be able to tell him if i didnt
go at once i tried not to think while
i was goin down the road but i
couldnt get her words out of my head
greater love



they seemed to keep time with my feet
an i heard them over an over again
tell-bill-i-want-to-see-him 
tell-bill-i-want-to-see-him 
at last i got to the house an found
bill inside mendin a net that hung
agin the wall he turned round quickly
when i came in an his heart
began to beat so hard that i could see
it thumpin inside his guernsey he
saw i wasnt lookin pleased so he
came near an put his two hands on my
shoulders an looked me in the face

  what cheer joe he says an i
could see that he was tryin to control
himself when i told him the message
he began tremblin all over an got as
white as a sheet then he says to me
in a thick kind o voice

  joe how did she look when she
said it

  i tried to tell him an asked him to
hurry on

  in a minute says he an went into
the other room

  when he came back i turned round
expectin to see him got up a bit but
there he was just as he went in in his
old workin clothes but he was quiet
lookin an had a smile on his face

  bill old lad i says arent ye
goin to tidy up a bit mayhap maryd
like to see ye neat

  no he says ill go as i am if
it be as it may be she wont like me
none the worse for coinin quick an if

it dont be- come on joe an dont

keep her waitin

  well we walked up the road without
sayin a word when we came in sight
of marys cottage it seemed darker to
me than it had been

  mary came out of the gate to meet
us an when she spoke to bill  dropped
behind they two went into the arbor
that we had built for her they sat
talkin for a few minutes-i could see
them through the hedge-an at last i
saw bill bend down his head an kiss
her she put her arms round his neck

an kissed him an at that the whole
of the light seemed to go out of the sky
an i wished i was dead

  i would have gone away but i could
hardly stir i leaned up against the
hedge an didnt mind any more till i
heard bills voice callin me i came
in at the gate puttin on as good a face
as i could an came into the arbor

  bill an mary was standin up an
bills face looked beamin while marys
was red as a rose

  bill beckoned me over an when i
came near he says

  well mary shall i tell him now
yes bill she says in a kind of a
whisper so he says to me

 joe i give her to you she
wouldnt let none do it but me for she
says she loves me like as a brother
take her joe an love her well an
god bless ye both 

  he put her in my arms an she clung
to me

  i was bewildered an could hardly
see but when i came to look about
there was mary in my arms with her
face buried in my breast an her arms
round my neck

  bill was makin down the road up-
right an steady as ever even then for
a moment i couldnt think of mary
for my thoughts went back to when i
saw bill kneelin beside his bed with
his arms stretched out an i felt-if
youll believe me-more sorrow than
joy i know now that bill had wrestled
with the devil that night an threw him
if ever a man did poor bill poor
bill

   suppose i neednt tell you what
mary an me said it wouldnt sound
much at any rate altho it pleased us
when i felt that she loved me i forgot
even bill an we was happier than
tongue could tell

  well the time went on for a month
or two an we was thinkin of gettin
married soon i was gettin my cottage
ready an spendin some of the money


peoples

i had saved to make it bright for mary
bill worked with me early an late but
it wasnt only his time that he gave
to me he would often go into the
town to buy the things i wanted an
im sure he never got them for what
he told me i said nothin for i knew
that it would only hurt him an it was
little enough that i could do for bill
to let him help if he chose i used to
watch him to see if be wasnt unhappy
but i never seed a sign of sorrow on
him he always looked happy an
bright an he worked harder than ever
an was kinder to all around him i
knew he didnt forget-for how could
he forget mary-an i feared at times
lest he might fret in secret but i never
seed him grieve i could hardly imag-
ine when i would think on it how
mary came to take me or love me when
bill was nigh her

  well the time wasnt long goin by
for we was happy an had all our lives
before us an at length the day came
round before we was to be married it
was easter sunday we was to be mar-
ried on an all the people as knew mary
an me-an that was all the village-
was goin to have a grand holiday we
was to go an have a feast out on the
island an we was gettin the boats
cleaned an nice an smart for the occa-
sion in coorse everybody had to bring
their own dinners but we was to join
them all together an make a grand
feast we had got a cask o beer an
we was to have great doins an a dance
on the grass theres the finest sod
for dancin in the countryside out yon-
der on the island an wed got mike
wheeler to bring his fiddle with an
extra set of strings we werent to
come home till evenin when the tide
turned an then we would have a race
home

  well bill an me we both took tea
at marys house that evenin an when
we came home bill asked me to go into
his house for a while an have a quiet

talk we lit our pipes drew up our
chairs an sat down by the fire an
puffed away without sayin a word
for some time an then bill says to me
well joe there wont be a man in
the church to-morrow that wont envy
you-except myself

  i thought of him kneelin down by
the bedside that mornin when he says
that so i thought to tell him i put
down piy pipe an came an put my
arms on his shoulder as i used to do
when we was boys together an told
him all i knew he just shook hands
with me an says he

   joe it was a hard fight but thank
god i won ive crushed out all the
old love now why lad to-morrow
shell be your wife an ill care for her
no more than any other woman-as a
sweetheart i mean for im a brother
to her now as long as we live-an to
you joe it aint that i think less of
her for id walk into the fire for her
this minute but-i cant explain it joe
you know what  mean

  bill i says youve been a true
friend to me an mary an i hope well
always be able to show how much we
both love you may god judge me
hard when i die if ever i have a hard
thought of you as long as i live

  we said no more after that i went
out but came back in a minute to tell
bill to be sure to come an wake me if
he was up first but when i was passin
the window i see him hangin a coat
up over it it wasnt that he thought
id spy on him again that he did that
i saw that in his face but he feared i
might see him again somehow and that
it might pain me

  well i woke in the mornin as soon
as it was daylight an went down an
had a swim an then came home an
brushed my new clothes an laid out the
shirt that mary had worked for me
herself an washed as white as snow
then bill came down to me he was
to take his breakfast with me that
greater love



mornin an he came all dressed for the
weddin in a new suit of clothes he
was a real handsome fine fellow at any
time but he looked like a gentleman
that mornin then i thought that mary
must have done right to choose a la-
borin man like me rather than a chap
like bill that was above all of us ex-
cept in his heart

  we went off to the church an waited
till mary an her mother came all the
people was there outside the porch an
some of the gentlefolks was inside the
squires family was in their pew for
ye see mary was a favorite with them
all an they came early to church to
see her married i felt very solemn
then but i could hardly feel as how
mary was goin to marry me there
she was as lovely as an angel an
blushin like a rose i said my i will
in a low voice for it seemed awkward
to me to say it loud but mary said
hers out in a clear sweet voice an
then the parson blessed us an spoke to
us so solemn that we both cried an
mary nestled up close to me when it
came to kiss the bride bill was first
an claimed the kiss so the other lads
had to give up bill bent down an took
her pretty face between his two hands
an kissed her on the forehead

  agin the weddin was over it was
time for service so we all went to our
seats-an i never felt solemner in my
life than i did then nor did mary
either

  when the service was over we all
came out an the people stood by on
both sides to let mary an me walk
down the churchyard together an go
first out of the gate

  we all went down to the beach
where the boats was ready on the shore
some of them was freshly painted an
a couple had bright ribbons tied about
them bills boat was the one that
mary an me was to go in an bill him-
self was to pull stroke oak in her he
had got for a crew three of the young

fellows we knew best an who was the
cracks at rowin an we was determined
to race all the other boats to the island
the lads had all run on before us an
when we came down to the beach the
boats was all ready an the baskets
with the dinner put in them so we all
got on board an off we started

  mary an me we held the rudder to-
gether an bill an his lads bent to their
oars an away we flew an in a quarter
of an hour came to the island leading
the others by a hundred yards we all
got out an the lads carried up the
baskets to the slope up yonder where
you see the moonlight shine on the
island where there was a fine level
place on the edge of the cliff

  the grass there was short an as
smooth as a table an when you stood
on the edge of the cliff the water was
straight below you for the rock went
sheer some forty feet mary an me
stood there on the edge while the lads
an the girls got ready the feast for
they wouldnt let us put hand to any-
thing an we looked at the water
hurryin by under us the tide had
turned an the water was runnin like
a mill race down away past the island
an runnin straight away for the head
off there as far as you can see the
currents is very contrary here so youd
better not get caught in them when
youre sailin or swimmin

  we all sat down an if we didnt
enjoy our dinner all of us it was a
queer thing an after dinner was over
the girls insisted on havin a dance we
got the things all cleared off an danced
away for some time an then some one
proposed blind mans buff one young
fellow was blinded an we all stood
round an then the fun began the
young chap-mark somers by name-
used to make wild rushes to try an get
some one an then the girls yelled out
an they all scurried away as quick as
they could an the fun grew greater an
greater at last he made a dive over


peoples

to the place where mary was standin
near the brink of the cliff we all
yelled to her to take care where she
was goin but i suppose she thought it
was merely our fun for she laughed
an screamed out like the others-an
stepped backward before any one
could stop her she went over the edge
of the cliff an disappeared i was sif-
tin up on a rock an when i saw her
fall over the edge i gave a cry that you
might have heard a mile away an
jumped down an ran across the grass

  but a better man than me was there
before me bill had pulled off his
jacket an kicked off his shoes an was
at the edge before me before he
jumped he cried out

  joe run for the boats quick  ill
keep her up till you come i can swim
stronger nor you

  i didnt wait a second but ran down
to where the boats was drawn up on
the beach some of the chaps came
with me as hard as they could run an
we shoved down the nearest boat but
in spite of all our efforts-an we was
so mad with excitement that not one
of us but had the strength of ten-it
took us a couple of minutes to get out
fair on the water

  well when we was fair started i
pulled so hard that i broke my oar an
we had to stop to get another an then
we had to row all the way round the
spur of the rocks out there before we
could even see whereabout mary an
bill should be the men an women
on the rocks -screamed out to us an
pointed in their direction an the boat
flew along at every stroke but the
current was mortal strong an they had
been for nigh five minutes in the water
before we caught sight of them an
it seemed to me to be years before we
came anigh them at all mary was
weighed down with her clothes an bill
with his an in spite of what a swim-
mer i knew bill was i feared lest we
should come too late

  at last we began to close on them
i could see over my shoulder as we
rowed i could only see marys face
but that was beacon enough for me i
called to one of the men to slip into
my place an row an he did an i got
out into the bows there was mary
with her face all white an her eyes
closed as if she was dead her hair
was all draggin in the water an as the
current rolled her along her dress
moved as if it was some strange fish
under the water i could see nothin
of bill but i hadnt need to think for
i knew that where mary was there was
bill somewhere anigh to her when
we came nearer i saw where bill was

  look here he was down under the
water an with his last breath he was
keepin her afloat till we came i saw
his two hands rise up out of the water
holdin her up by the hair but that was
all manys the time since then that
in spite of all i loved mary i was
tempted to be cross with her-for we
laborin men is only rough folk after
all an we have a deal o hardship to
bear at times but whenever i was
tempted to say a hard word or even
to think hard of her them two hands
of bills seemed to rise up between me
an her and i could no more think or
say a hard word than i could stand
quiet an see another man strike her
an i wouldnt be like for to do that

  well we took them into the boat an
came home mary recovered for she
had only had the shock of her fall but
when we took in bill it was only-

  he kept his word that he spoke to me
that night he gave up his life for hers
youll see that on his tomb in the
churchyard that we all put up to him 

 greater love hath no man than
this that a man shall give up his life
for his friend

  theres no more left like bill an
mary thinks it too as well as me

tke tide

by herman howard mdttesorv

avlfxor of ten boat dilltc 

by a devious route the young officer made his way to the bald rocky
dome of mount constitution which arose twenty-five hundred
feet above the sea level and which in clear weather commanded an
unobstructed view of no less than fifty islands of the san juan group

no his folks didnt give him that
name he earned it hisself you
know cultus is siwash talk for
all thats ornery cussed and devilish
thats him-cultus kennedy

  is he really so bad asked the
younger man smiling with the confident
arrogance of youth or lias he one of
those traditional bad-man reputations
built upon a trifle originally and puffed
into formidable size through the years
and many imaginative repetitions
hes the goods is cultus kennedy
hes swore to kill anybody that squawks
on him and hes swore to kill any officer
that tries to take him hes went across
twice on each bet that i know my
advice to you baker is if ever you get
dost enough to him to take him have
along plenty of help of the quick acker-
ate-shootin variety cultusll murder
old man tracy owner of one of the
best salmon traps on lower puget
sound glared from the watch deck to

where the pot and spiller with several
fathoms of net ripped into useless
shreds lay tossing about upon the tide
rips he drew a long breath then
burst into a torrent of profanity di-
rected equally at cultus and his gang of
fish pirates and at nat baker and the
state fish-and-game commission of
which latter organization the young
man was an officer you fellers
couldnt ketch a sick chub fish if some
one gilled and gaffed him first why
you-i-

  the old mans lower jaw pendulous
for a moment snapped shut biting a
final expletive fairly in two his eyes
rested fondly upon the figure of a
young girl coming down the dock
elly said he his voice modulated in
an affectionate greeting

  father i just know that you have
been scolding nat-mr baker you
shouldnt its hardly fair to expect
him to accomplish in a few weeks what


peoples

others have tried for years to do and
failed

  maybe not but look at that con-
tinued the old man irately pointing to
the wreck of the ruined trap theres
five hundred dollars damage and be-
sides the chances is there was a couple
of thousand dollars worth of fish took
out through that hole and they purty
near killed my watchman bosquith
his tongue was black as your hat and
stickin out a foot when i found him
this mornin snubbed to that pile im
glad it was no worse i think a heap
of bosqy hes a good man ive a
notion to let him off for a week hed
ketch them devils

  baker with gentle sarcasm ventured
to remind mr tracy that his watch-
man very recently indeed had en-
joyed a rare and unusual opportunity
to capture the pirates

  but they snuk up on him explained
tracy they didnt give him no
chance t they busted him over the
head with a belayin pin well this
hollerin wont mend this trap

  ella and nat in silence watched the
old man until he disappeared from sight
behind one of the warehouses which
bordered the shore line i had some-
thing-something i wanted to speak to
your father about said the young man
embarrassedly i guess this is rather
a poor time

  the girl flushed but did not directly
answer the implied question the fish
pirates have driven poor father nearly
crazy but you must not mind bis sav-
age speech

  did you see the watchman bos-
quith when your father found him tied
this morning asked nat abruptly

  ella gave him a quick suspicious
glance why

  i am curious to know exactly how
the rope was tied and whether it was
tied tightly

  surely nat you do not suspect bos-
quith be fair its foolish very very

foolish of you to be jealous of him
but im afraid that you are-the least
mite father appears to think so too
and takes a delight in telling me over
and again how faithful bosquith is and
how much money he has saved up
father thinks- 

  father thinks that he would like to
have bosquith for a son-in-law now
isnt that it but what does ella
think

  nat exclaimed she angrily i have
known mr bosquith a long time and i
like him very much you must not
speak so anyway mr bosquith has
proven himself and frankly thus far
you havent

  bakers face went scarlet no i
havent he replied savagely but
wait ella in less than twenty-four
hours i will have proven myself by
this time to-morrow cultus and his gang
will be in irons i mean it

 you mean it how

  not a living soul even my captain
knows all the details but i am going
to tell you you have heard your father
remark perhaps have seen yourself the
light which every few nights shows
from the top of mount constitution i
have been on shore duty for a fortnight
and i have been watching that light
every time that the light has flashed
one or more traps in this pass have
been pirated

  a signal

  yes a signal i have not been able
to discover the pirates hiding place but
 have learned that the light on consti-
tution shows only in answer to a pre-
vious flash from waldron island one
of the pirate gang climbs to the dome
every night if waldron signals he
repeats it waldron guards the outlet
to the pass but is invisible from this
side of orcas island our patrol cut-
ter when on duty in other waters must
pass waldron the sentinel there im-
mediately flashes the news to the pi-
rate on constitution who in turn
the turn of the tide



advises his fellows that they are safe
to raid any trap from lighthouse rock
to point francis

  how strange exclaimed ella
bosquith told me that the flashes on
constitution were signals given by engi-
neers engaged in mapping the islands
ali bosquith told you  i see ella 
mind you now i am not saying who it
is-there is a watchman on some of
these traps who is working with the pi-
rate gang

  i know it is not bosquith it isnt
fair-

  i didnt say it was bosquith any-
way to-night the cutter is supposed to
be at point roberts twenty miles away
i have seen to it that the information
has been industriously circulated among
the trapmen i will stake my life that
the news is in the possession of cultus
and his crew by now

  your plan reminded the girl ea-
gerly

  the cutter will not pass waldron to-
night hence there will be no signal from
there the pirate will be on watch on
constitution however and i propose
to make him prisoner then i will flash
the signal myself simple yes that
is why it will work the gang will think
they are safe to loot the traps they
will get to work and we will take them
in the very act for the patrol and three
extra swift motors all filled with armed
men will also answer my signal from
the top between dark and four bells
i shall light the torch that will illu-
minate some pretty shady doings

  the girls eyes were shining brightly
her cheek was flushed nat ex-
claimed she admiringly if you only
do it

  do it certainly a whole lot de-
pends upon this nights work some-
thing even more important perhaps
than the taking of cultus kennedy

something-

  her quick comprehending glance an-
swered him be careful nat re-

member what father told you more
than one member of that outlawed band
will shed blood ill watch for the light
and ill hope and think and wish just as
hard for you as i possibly can

  thank you ella im going now
to throw off suspicion i shall climb
from the olga side good-by she
gave him a warm handclasp and
watched him until he disappeared
around a bend in the trail

  by a devious route the young officer
made his way to the bald rocky dome
of  mount constitution which arose
twenty-five hundred feet above the sea
level and which in clear weather com-
manded an unobstructed view of  less
than fifty islands of the san juan
group a fringe of scrub pine grew to
within a short distance of the top after
securing three or four dry fir branches
thick with needles to serve as a torch
baker hid them in a handy spot and
began to look for an advantageous place
in which to secrete himself a clump of
brush looking out upon the northern
aspect of the mountain and the greater
portion of the pass and not more than
twenty-five feet from the stony pinna-
cle accommodated him he crept in
looked to see that his matches-which
waterman style he carried beneath the
sweatband of his hat-were safe and
began to survey the superb panorama
which lay before him

  down the mountainside a distance
of six or seven hundred feet and fac-
ing toward the tracy and sinclair traps
was an old log cabin long since aban-
doned to the tenancy of the birds and
beasts of the forest the faintest pos-
sible wreath of gray smoke curled from
the tumbled-down chimney camp-
ers thought nat later reflecting that
this conjecture seemed improbable yet
deciding that it would be imprudent at
that time to make any further investi-
gation

  the twilights are long in the san
juan highlands and nat awaiting dusk




	peoples

for what seemed an interminable time
occupied himself in reviewing from
every possible angle his plan to capture
the kennedy gang concluding satisfac-
torily that they were almost certain of
apprehending the majority and scatter-
ing the remainder

  ella as night came on unable to oc-
cupy herself with any of her usual tasks
began to pace nervously about the
house finally she threw a shawl about
her shoulders and walked out upon the
watch deck of her fathers fish trap
bosquith his throat swathed in several
folds of bandage a rifle in his hands
had just emerged from the watch
shanty preparatory to taking up his
nightly vigil he called eagerly to the
girl and hastened forward to meet her
back and forth upon the planking they
walked the man alternately imploring
and threatening over some momentous
question several times as if dis-
traught ella turned and focused her
gaze upon the mountain top which
arose clear and distinct from the deep
shadows which enshrouded its base
bosquith seized her hand she with-
drew it angrily and turned as if to go
back to the house he resumed his
pleading and she paused to listen a
moment then reaching forth she
clasped his fingers a second later she
was running rapidly to the house  bos-
quith entered his tiny cabin threw a
bundle of clothing into a dory which
lay bumping against the piling wrote
rapidly a note which he pinned to the
shanty door then climbed into the craft
and rowed swiftly along the shore to
the north ella in almost the same
moment her slender form hidden be-
neath the folds of her fathers tar-
paulin coat emerged from the house
carrying a small lantern fearlessly
she turned into the darkness of a path
that led away also to the northward

  nat busy with the speculations which
continually traversed his mind became
more alertly watchful as the darkness

deepened unhappy misgivings with
regard to ella and bosquith continued
to obtrude themselves however but
were suddenly dismissed when a sound
coming faintly from below struck upon
his hearing then a stone loosened
from the trail went tumbling noisily
down the mountainside a branch
switched back into place a scrambling
footstep followed

  he strained his eyes toward the spot
where the trail emerged from the brush
more rocks went tumbling twigs
cracked footsteps drew nearer and
nearer whoever it was was coming
on at a rapid pace with a fine disregard
for caution and making no effort at
concealment so much the better
thought nat my presence very evi-
dently is not suspected

  he felt in the armhole of his vest
where he always carried his handcuffs
to see that they were safe and un-
snapped the flap to the holster which
held his automatic pistol ill just
handcuff you to a tree my friend
he communed apostrophizing his ap-
proaching visitor then ill set off the
signal flash after which you and i will
march down the mountain with you in
front

  suddenly nat uttered a half-sup-
pressed exclamation no single human
being ever made as much racket as all
that the sound was loud enough for
half a dozen men yes he could hear
voices a head covered with a rubber
souwester hat appeared above the rock
rim then followed a body clothed in
the rough garb of a fisherman came
then a second a third a fourth and a
fifth the last a gigantic shambling crea-
ture hands hanging almost to the knees
evil pig eyes searching the mountain-
side suspiciously without a doubt was
the dread cultus kennedy himself

  there had been a hitch in the pro-
gram  something had gone wrong
young baker promptly dismissed any
idea of employing the handcuffs in-
the turn of the tide



stead slipping the automatic from the
holster and snapping the safety down
into the firing notch

  four of the pirates stopped at the
base of the monolith which comprised
the actual summit of the mountain
while the leader growling peevishly
climbed to the top one of the men
nearly stepped upon nat the latter
could have reached out and touched the
fish thief upon the knee

  whatever do you spose is keepin
capstan demanded the chief with an
oath weve dumb two foot to his
one and him and his fellers haint here
yet

  maybe theyve found something
offered one of the band

  maybe capstan allers is slow
though unless its whisky hes after
they haint nobody pearter than cap-
stan when a drinks in sight its time
he was here cultus struck a match
and hauled iorth by a leather lanyard a
bulging-faced silver watch a degree or
so smaller than an ordinary alarm
clock here it is dost to two bells
nine oclock

  capstan was goin to stop at the
tracy trap you know cultus and see
that party suggested the pirate who
before had spoken in behalf of the tardy
member he might of had to lay out
in the jungles waitin for him

  i hear em coinin now exclaimed
another of the gang

  presently three men traveling the
same trail by which nat had ascended
appeared and joined the others at the
summit there haint nobody come
back down by the olgy way stated
the newcomers spokesman

  he sure didnt come down our way
replied cultus thats a sign lies
here spread out look sharp now
get him-or kill him 

promptly the seven men sprang into
the brush and began beating about in
every direction pausing now and then
to light matches and peer beneath the


thick drooping branches of fir and
larch

  somebodys been here but gone
shouted one who had stumbled onto a
patch of trampled grass where nat had
secured one of his dry fir boughs the
leaves and grass lias just been mussed
up recent

  well look good replied cultus
lighting his pipe nonchalantly we
know lies here get him 

  to attempt to make a fight against
that gang would-be a case of pure sui-
cide nat well knew that while he
might kill one or more-members of the
crew his own life would be the price
besides any precipitate action would
absolutely defeat the object of the plan
namely to capture the whole thieving
outfit no this was no time place or
condition for a battle this was a time
for flight if he could manage to get
to the bottom he could give the alarm
a dozen determined men with the as-
sistance of three fast boats could al-
most positively prevent the escape from
the mountain of any of the eight pi-
rates

  could he dared be make a dash for
it if ever now was the time for cul-
tus alone stood between him and the
path leading down to the north shore
from the dome downward for a dis-
tance there were but two trails and
these in places were almost perpen-
dicular what if he stumbled he
must risk it

  his good fortune in thus far escaping
detection nat knew might be attrib-
uted to the fact that he had chosen his
hiding place in a spot so close to the
summit the seven men were beating
the bush toward the olga side cultus
guarded the north beach path which
should it be-seven men or cultus
cultus will kill had said old man
t racy

  cautiously nat arose from his stoop-
ing posture and softly parted the
branches with his left hand feeling


peoples

ahead carefully first with one foot and
then the other he contrived to extricate
himself from the tangle without making
any betraying sound inch by inch un-
til within little more than an arms
length of the pirate chief the young
officer crept

  he dared not risk a shot at the
first blow he must strike cultus insen-
sible gathering himself for the spring
the automatic grasped tightly in his up-
lifted right -hand he launched himself
into space and struck blindly sav-
agely

  cultus old corncob pipe saved him
in the instant stooping to knock the
ashes from the bowl he received nats
crushing blow upon the shoulder the
terrific impact brought him nearly to
his knees but with a horrible bellow of
rage he flung his gorillalike arms about
the young officer and the two fighting
like madmen the pirate to gain posses-
sion of the weapon nat to strike an-
other a decisive blow crashed off the
narrow rocky table into the clump of
brush

  the pirates from every direction
ran to the assistance of their chief
capstan as powerful a man as his su-
perior seized baker by the throat an-
other grasped his arms another his
legs cultus cursing abominably
scrambled to his feet and drew a long
sheath knife

  belay on that cultus said cap-
stan sharply as his leader drew back
the blade to strike lets figger this
out if its our course to slice up this
here young stinger fish we can still
do it later on leisurelike and genteel

  capstan had released his iron grip
upon nats throat but four of the pi-
rates one of whom had nearly broken
the officers wrist in wringing the gun
from his grasp now dragged the pris-
oner to the top of the rocky dome

  cultus gave vent to a hoarse mirth-
less laugh say you haint so dam
smart we knowed when you started

out from the tracy trap and we
knowed why you was cornin and
what im goin to do to youll be a les-
son to some of your meddlin outfit
well learn you to mind your own busi-
ness they was fish in this sound be-
fore you come and likely therell be
some left after we get through with
you and were goin to keep right on
helpin ourselves cumtux

  again cultus whipped out his knife
but again capstan interposed

  the latter rapidly but thoroughly
binding nats arms behind him with a
strand of tarred rope listened without
comment to his superiors blasphe-
mous account of the attack which had
been made upon him he aimed to
bust my binnacle wide open thats what
he done instead hes stove up my
staboard rail what am i goin to
do why im goin to make him look
like a humpy salmon thats been fed
through the blades of a iron chink

  stow that talk until i and you have
talked over whats to be done said
capstan decisively the other boys
can go on ahead with young stinger
here and well follow

  one of the pirates picked nats hat
from the ground but capstan struck it
from bis hand and demanded a rag
with which to fashion a gag young
stinger might take a notion to go to
disturbin the quiet explained he

  three bandanna handkerchiefs none
of the cleanest were knotted together
and bound tightly over bakers lips
roughly the five pirates dragged their
victim down the trail while cultus and
capstan followed their voices lifted oc-
casionally in stormy debate a brief
stop was made at the deserted log cabin
when the party hurried on to the shore
bundled nat into a boat and divided
among three dories rowed away to-
ward the eastern end of the pass

  presently the dory containing cultus
and his lieutenant capstan came
alongside the boat in which nat was
the turn of the tide



the unwilling passenger well land
at old tracys trap ordered cultus
shortly the craft bumped its prow
against some piling baker was hauled
to his feet and hoisted bodily onto the
dock

  cultus and capstan still were wran-
gling over some question  tell you
thats the system said capstan you
do what i say and nobody cant never
in a million years check this here job
up to us hes got it cornin to him
hed squeal on us in a minute if he
dast what word he give me i had to
choke out of him anyway both of
em is crazy about this girl and every-
body knows it women is generally at
the bottom of such tangles i read that
into a book onct dont you see how
everybodyll think he done it but you
haint got no romance in your sys-
tem

  cultus profanely disavowed harbor-
ing any such weakness but grunted per-
mission for capstan to go ahead with
his plan at a sign from the chief nat
was dragged forward

  from the outer end of the trap a
light was discernible in the tracy home
usually a lighted lantern hung in the
window of the watch shanty to-night
the place was dark the watch deck
itself was deserted nat watching the
flicker in the window of the trapmans
house wondered if ella had thought of
him as she had promised and whether
she might not even at that moment be
waiting and looking for the expected
flash on the mountaintop

  one of the pirates at a signal held
a revolver at bakers head were
goin to take your gag off just a min-
ute dont holler i aimed to gaff
you up considerable with my knife
said cultus proceeding with much
pomp to pronounce the victims doom
only capstan here he thought it was
a poor system maybe so anyway i
give in by now likely youve begun
to figger that its poor dope to run

afoul of me and my gang still what
time youve got to think you can think
as you please we knowed when you
sneaked up the mountain and we
knowed what for it was your last
sneak

  i know how you learned an-
swered nat bosquith tracys watch-
man told you

  correct answered capstan before
cultus could reply bosqy was the
boy

  im goin to give you a chance
continued cultus it haint no great
shakes of a chance ill admit fact is
it haint moren one chance in a mil-
lion im doin it just to humor cap-
stan here

  nats heart sank with a mortal fear
but his voice was steady and resolute
all right vvhat are you going to
do with me

  its three bells said cultus strik-
ing a match under the shelter of his
coat and again consulting the enor-
mous chronometer at five bells the
tide will be flood high at the turn of

the tide- well itll give you nearly

an hour if youre lucky somebody
might find you before then capstan 

  at the word the gag was again tied
tightly about nats mouth and chin
some dreadful foreboding of his fate
struck in upon his consciousness and
he began to struggle madly as four
pairs of hands laid hold upon him for-
ward they dragged him to a sloping
gangway built thus to accommodate
boats at any stage of water capstan
kicked the captives feet from under
him they slid him like a trussed pig
down the slippery planks and thrust
his body up to the armpits into the
chill salt chuck with strands of rope
they tied him to two heavy iron boat
cleats which were bolted to the dock
timbers

  well go back to our cabin pack
up our outfit and put out for fraser


peoples

river said cultus there ort to be
fat pickin up there for a spell

  yes agreed capstan jocularly
and about the time these geeks in the
pass begin to think theyre shut of us
for good well come a-voyagin back
and help em get rid of a few scow-
loads of silvers

  the appreciative laugh from his fel-
lows emboldened capstan to attempt
some further witticisms he stepped
down the gangway and gave nat a tug
by the shoulder to determine whether
the ropes held securely good-by
young stinger in a few minutes now
youll either be whangin a harp or
shovelin coal ive got friends in both
places so tell em klahowya for me

  cultus and his gang climbed into
their dories and pulled swiftly away
toward the landing place below the de-
serted log cabin

  nat by torturing degrees lying upon
his back his body slanted at an angle
of about thirty degrees felt the deadly
chill of the cold salt water creeping
upon him not until that moment did
he sense to the full the fate that was
upon him in a few moments piti-
fully few he must meet his supreme
agony speculatively he wondered
once the waters had risen and closed
from him the last sweet breath of
heavens air how many seconds the
eventful struggle would last

  was he to die thus never he
gathered his feet under him and strove
frantically to gain a hold upon the slimy
planks which slipped always from un-
der exhausted finally he desisted

  straight before him mount constitu-
tion arose darkly above the dull silver
sheen of the placid bay a few hun-
dred fathoms away within shouting dis-
tance almost a dozen armed men in
speedy boats awaited the flash from
the dome which would bring some of
them rushing straight to the very trap
upon which voiceless powerless he lay
awaiting death

  the signal from the mountaintop
that had been the slogan the chief
deputy had said the very instant
that the light appears with full speed
ahead we will board and search every
trap in the pass

  the flash from the mountain the
signal the signal again and again
as if it were an incantation nat re-
peated his prayer

  how futile the prayer who would
fire the signal that had been his self-
appointed task braggartly he had said
that the light should show that night

  in a sudden access of fury he rolled
and flung his body about like a man
in a maniacal frenzy he strove against
his bonds until his muscles ached pos-
sibly he thought if he could contrive
to loosen the thongs ever so little he
might be able to hold his mouth and
nose above water until the tide began
to turn finally the pain of lacerated
flesh actually bringing surcease to the
more poignant mental agony he man-
aged to tear one arm partly free but
the tide worked faster than he an
occasional wave flung its foamy crest
fairly in his face

  the signal the signal

  again he attacked his fetters-but
still they held another wave the high-
est thus far broke for an instant sub-
merging his whole face and head some
of the brackish water entered his nos-
trils oh so desperately he struggled
to gain just one more unpolluted re-
vivifying breath a roaring came in
his ears a merciful unconsciousness
to pain began to possess him points
of fire danced before him one single
speck of light finally settled within the
field of his vision and grew and grew
-the flash upon the mountain

 no no it could not be this
was naught but the last torturing phan-
tasm which cruel death was blazing
upon his brain before granting final
merciful oblivion
the turn of the tide

 

  but hark boats were coming
men were shouting

  it was the light like a great wedge
of gold splitting the darkness the flam-
ing signal showed upon the mountain-
top

  nat nat come out of it its
me nat you know-lobscouse your
bunky

  nat rolled his head painfully then
lapsed again into unconsciousness in
answer to the prodigious shout raised
by the worthy lobscouse the patrol
cutter and two of the motor boats
ranged alongside the tracy trap

  i found nat lashed to the gang-
way explained lobscouse excitedly
i nearly stepped on him when i
swarmed up onto the watch deck he
was tied and gagged the water was
breakin all over him in another min-
ute hed a been dead nat nat
come out of it

  young baker was tenderly lifted and
placed aboard the patrol cutter a hot
drink warm blankets and the vigorous
rubbing of coarse but friendly hands
soon brought him to himself the pi-
rates have gone to the deserted log
cabin off north beach said he weakly
hurry

  at once the patrol and the convoying
motors got under way nat in the in-
terim patching together the details of
his adventure only one question re-
mained unsolved who had set off the
signal 

  fired by retributive rage nat in-
sisted upon taking his place with his
fellows and performing his part in the
raid upon the pirate rendezvous he
walked rather weakly to the after deck
and surveyed the three motor boats as
muffled down they sped alongside of
the patrol a quarter of a mile astern
and coming on at a rapid rate were the
lights of another craft the identity of
which in the darkness baker could not
determine

  quickly the landing was made the
chief deputy bad already planned the
attack well take no chances if
we surround the pirates in the cabin
well set fire to it and capture or kill
every one of them

  in a few moments the cabin was
reached and the deputies following or-
ders quickly invested it lobscouse his
arms loaded with dry fir branches crept
to the rear of the structure piled the
mass against the windowless wall and
touched it off

  at the first crackle of flame cultus
six-shooter in hand rushed to the door
surrender cultus kennedy shouted
the chief deputy

  the pirate fired point-blank at the
officer and leaped back into the cabin
his shot fortunately went wild the
flames roaring up the dry walls of the
house had now caught in the cedar-
shake rooling

  come out your hands above your
heads shouted the deputy six of
the pirate band obeying staggered
from the door and gave themselves up

  cultus and capstan are still in
there shouted nat look out

  two forms sprang from the door
and firing in every direction plunged
toward the trail a shot through the
thigh laid capstan low nat and lob-
scouse threw themselves upon kennedy
and bore him to the earth

  at this juncture the occupant of
the motor which had followed the dep-
uties and who proved to be old man
tracy puffed into view a thousand
dollars if you get him he panted

  take your pick said the officer
waving his hand toward the eight man-
acled criminals

  no i mean bosquith hes gone
and my little girl elly shes gone too
bosquith left a note he said hed been
stealin fish and workin with cultus
to get money so he could marry elly
he said he wanted to reform but cut-


peoples

tus and capstan wouldnt let him the
letter winds up ella understands
the thousand goes to any man thatll
ketch bosquith

 ella gone nat dazed by the
words tried to think clearly what they
meant ella gone  bosquith gone 
the tinder-dry cabin was now a roar-
ing mass of flame brilliantly illuminat-
ing the whole mountainside

  look lobscouse pointed to the
dome where a figure wrapped in the
folds of a tarpaulin coat stood sil-
houetted against the lurid sky

  its elly its elly  shouted old
man tracy capering about rheumati-
cally she haint went with bosquith
i knowed she wouldnt elly elly
yes father her voice came clear
and distant from above is nat all
right i found his hat on the dome
i knew he was in trouble so i fired
the signal

  nat trumpeted his hands to his lips
and in a voice none of the steadiest
he shouted im all right ella im
coming right up its too dark on the
trail for you to be alone

wilberforce scott was the son of wilberforce scott jtniversally known as will
or wilber wilberforce junior was not known as will nor as wilber at
any rate he discouraged the abbreviations his father had not been stall-fed hand-
laundered tailored or sugar-coated in a foreign land he was a home product

if there is anything in the world that
can equal in fatuity vacuity and
the entire absence of any visible
mental functioning a certain type of
wealthy american youth who has been
stall-fed on piccadilly hand-laundered
in grosvenor square tailored on bond
street and sugar-coated in english
country houses the product should be
advertised at once the challenge will
pass unheeded there is no competitor

  wilberforce scott was the son of
wilberforce scott universally known
as will or wilber wilberforce
junior was not known as will nor as
wilber at any rate he discouraged
the abbreviations his father had not
been stall-fed hand-laundered tailored
or sugar-coated in a foreign land he
was a home product

  in an odd moment between two days
scott senior having just said good
night to certain fellow captains of in-

dustry who had spent the evening with
him was sitting in front of his library
fire ruminating upon the chances of
making two million dollars grow where
only one million grew before enter
wilberforce junior fresh or stale
rather from adreary farce

  wilberforce scowled over the pages
of punch as he flicked them over un-
observingly then he swung one leg
across a corner of the table and turned
a glance of indolent appeal to the male
author of his being

  fawther he said as one speaks to
a fellow sufferer dont you find life
an infernal haw

possibly admitted senior rather
absently what the devils a baw
oh a daily round that leaves the
emotions unsatisfied-the-aw-intel-
lect unstretched you know

  every try roller skating down fifth
avenue
the proof of it



  n-no that wouldnt be just the
thing besides i cawnt roller skate
there is no doubt about it life offers
dashed few inducements

  senior turned his head half around
and examined bis son critically

  i apologize he murmured
  apologize for what

  well i suppose its largely my fault
that you have to carry this awful bur-
den of life

  wilberforce laughed indulgently
oh well now i dont exactly blame
you you know fawther i-well i
dont object to my fellow men very
much theres no need to apologize
really

  im apologizing to your fellow men
there seems to be an apology due to
somebody at any rate

  scott senior propelled his chair vio-
lently backward with the impetus of
his powerful body as he arose suddenly
will youre a fool he snapped
but its my own fault so ill have to
endure it youre a damned fool
this conclusion seemed like a suit-
able termination to the days activities
its finality being beyond argument so
scott senior retired wilberforce pen-
duluming one leg from the comer of
the table staring into the fire with an
air between perplexity and resentment
deciding that the pose was one well
calculated to excite the sympathy bis
soul craved he did not change it when
his sister florence peeped in

mother got home yet she asked
havent seen her replied wilber-
force his tone emphasizing the testi-
mony his looks gave that he was
stricken to the heart

  why the dejection little firefly
demanded florence

  wilberforce looked at his sister as
though to prepare her for the dreadful
shock

  fawther says that i am a damned
fool he announced

  florence frowned and shrugged

  i wish dad wouldnt swear so she
complained good night willy
wilberforce stared at the door medi-
tatively at first lie was merely resent-
fully conscious that the desired sym-
pathy had not been forthcoming but
as he ruminated it dawned upon him
that the lack of sympathy had been
of a very positive character that in
short florence agreed with everything
except her fathers profanity willy
moreover was his pet aversion

  he flushed angrily and sprang to his
feet snapping his cigarette case open
and shut with a vicious speed that made
wonderful the fact that he had actually
extracted a cigarette there was the
germ of efficiency there surely he
didnt light the cigarette however he
pitched it with a forcible outcurve
motion into the fire germ of a tem-
per too

  that said a voice behind him is
a perfectly reckless way to treat a gold
monogram

  he turned his mother was smiling
at him from the doorway she closed
the door and came toward him

  what on earth has disturbed you
willy she asked

  mother he begged please be kind
enough not to call me willy i have
been called names enough for one
evening

  why my son who can possibly have
done such a thing perhaps mrs
scott was referring to the aroused
symptoms of vitality rather than feel-
ing any astonishment that anybody
should call her son names

  fawther and florence have called
me a damned fool

  not in chorus surely florence
no father called me a damned
fool florence-aw-regretted the
profanity

  mrs scott sighed and smiled

  your father is quite too frank she
said i wouldnt let it upset me wil-
berforce good night my son


peoples

  she kissed him sighed and smiled
again and went

  i should say he is too frank mut-
tered wilberforce altogether too
- he paused suddenly to con-
sider frank did not seem to be the
word he would have chosen frank
dash it all why frank and his
mother had certainly offered no sym-
pathy she had not even asked why
his father had called him a fool no
she had taken the provocation for
granted

  he snapped out another cigarette by
the same process of magical speed
this time he struck a match but was
arrested in the act of applying it to
the tobacco by another opening of the
door peterson the butler entered

  do you wish me to wait up sir or
will you put the lights out

  wilberforce regarded the butler for
a moment in moody silence his
lacerated mind panted for vindication

  peterson he demanded at last do
i look like a damned fool

  petersons mouth and eyes assumed
grotesque proportions

  i beg your pardon sir he asked
the question is a simple one wil-
berforce insisted it has been-aw-
hinted to me that certain people have
little confidence in my mental endow-
ments whereas i dont think i look at
all like a-well like a fool do you
the line of petersons duties had not
extended into this intimate region here-
tofore and the situation caught him
unprepared

  i certainly should not say so sir
besides no man should be judged by
his looks

  the longer one examines this dic-
tum the more ambiguities seem to
wind their way through it peterson
though quite unconscious of the fact
had created a masterpiece wilberforce
did not examine it very long there
was enough meat in it at one glance
for him he took one swift look at

petersons innocent countenance then
hurled another gold monogram to un-
zesthetic destruction

  get my hat and coat he snapped
im going to take a stroll

  wilberforce did take a stroll he
strolled due east disregarding in his
absorption the fact that if one strolls
due east on manhattan island one is
almost sure to arrive at atmospheres
more reminiscent of whitechapel and
petticoat lane in alliance than of
grosvenor square

  it was late the street he had fol-
lowed was dim and almost deserted
wilberforce was ruminating more in
sorrow by this time than in anger
he left the regions of human residence
and struck a no-mans land of ware-
houses and factories

  a citizen approached him-a citizen
of burly figure and uncultivated appear-
ance they met under a lamp-post the
citizen with his back to it wilberforce
naturally facing it their sizes were
as david and goliath wilberforce
was not goliath

  got a match mister asked the cit

  wilberforce stopped unbuttoned his
overcoat and took his gold match safe
from his vest pocket the citizens
large and grimy hand closed upon it

  ill help myself he said obligingly
he reached out at the same time and
extracted wilberforces gold watch
with its diamond-studded fob from the
other pocket

  wilberforce watched the movement
with hypnotized surprise the fellow
slipped both articles into his pockets

  glad i met you mister be assured
his victim as one to whom life is just
one pleasant meeting after another

  that old adage about it taking two
to make a quarrel is all wrong it takes
two to make a peace just one can
start something besides wilberforce
needed a match also as the citizen
proceeded with the intent of passing
him wilberforce used that violent out-
the proof of it



curve motion for the third time that
evening only this time the motion ter-
minated on the point of the citizens
chin there was nothing deadly about
wilberforces hook but it was followed
by wilberforces hundred and thirty
pounds with a suddenness that left no
time for argument

  anybody who has paid three dollars
for the privilege of watching two husky
truck drivers maul each other harm-
lessly in a fourteen-foot ring has sur-
mised that only one big man in five
thousand has the faintest idea of how
to hit our cit was not the five thou-
sandth man and to this fact wilber-
force doubtless owed his life

  like a wild cat he was all over the
big fellow who cuffed and mauled and
bruised and scraped and rolled on him
tearing his clothes and bumping his nose
into a streaming redness by means of
a cast-iron skull wilberforce was
picked up and bounced down he was
dragged around and swung around but
always he managed to keep one hand
frantically gripped on some part of his
antagonist and frequently he managed
to make the other hand beat a frenzied
tattoo upon the citizens unbeautiful
face

  at last the big fellow managed to
hurl him a few feet away but in doing
so slipped to his knees looking up
watchfully at his persistent little enemy

  the mark was clear and wilberforce
lost no time in selecting it every ounce
of his bodily force plus his fighting
rage concentrated in the point of his
right foot and was propelled upon the
chin of the unknown collector of ar-
ticles of virtu and that worthy imme-
diately and abruptly withdrew his
opposition

  wilberforce regained his possessions
without delay supplementing them by
one piece of lead pipe he found in the
fallen ones pocket he debated for a
moment the justice of dropping the ac-

quisition gently on the cast-iron skull
for the first time he took stock of the
surroundings he found that he was
quite near the river among a dingy
smelly mass of river-front commercial
buildings which accounted for his hav-
ing as it were pursued his battle in
peace

  abandoning the idea of connecting
the lead pipe with the skull he slipped
it into his pocket wiped as he fondly
believed the blood from his face and
retraced his steps rapidly

  inside the door he met his father

  thought i heard you come in he
began your mother said-

  wilberforce had got to his feet and
stood revealed in all his gory dishevel-
ment as his father switched on more
light the sight halted seniors explana-
tion what mother said was never
told

  for the love of heaven he pleaded
where did you interrupt the disaster

  wilberforce told him exhibiting the
lead pipe as a trophy

  his father gazed at him stunned
let me get this clear he gasped
he didnt try to beat you up or any-
thing you just swung on him with
the intent of knocking him down and
recovering your property not because
you had to defend yourself you
started things

  of course he believed that all he
had to do was merely to take my things
and walk away with them i consid-
ered the assumption insulting and 
had had quite enough insults for one
evening

  scott senior continued to stare at
his warlike offspring then he laughed

  i said you were a damned fool and
this confirms it he chuckled but
son thats the kind of foolishness that
has built this country-never counting
the odds i reckon you belong here all
right

  and they shook hands man to man

  put together into one small schooner
an irish skipper a dutch mate a chi-
nese cook and a malay crew add one
very ordinary rather small black pig
and stir-whats the answer figure it
out

 the colleen lavins schooner
jogged lazily along through the warm
seas west of north borneo and a por-
tent of trouble hung over her like a
black thundercloud amidships in a
pen under the fore boom a small black
pig lay on its side squealing with the
pain of a broken leg near by on the
deck a heavy block lay where it had
bounced after falling from aloft and
missing the pigs head at the expense of

its leg a malay seaman was disap-
pearing into the tiny focsle nursing
with both hands a bruised ear and
bleeding nose and captain paddy
lavin soothed his injured pet with one
hand while the other bunched into a
lump of knuckles threatened further
damage to the retreating seaman

turned away with a growl of disgust

spread-agle th brown divil as drops it
th crew aint asked to ate pork and
oill ate whut oi loike matey an fer
want av an ice chist oill kape my pork-
fresh by kapin it aloive till its

  dots all right cabtin grumbled the
mate squinting anxiously forward
where half a dozen sullen-faced malays
chattered and gesticulated to the fiery
address of a villainous piratical sea
dyak dey dondt got to eat de pig
but dey got to schweep oudt de pen
yoost de same an its yoost playin
mit dynamide to make dem touch dot
pig bedder let soon wat stick him
cabtin fore we gits schtuck ourselves
yet

  zim voog walked aft to resume his
watch and left the skipper busy with
his pig lavin rigged a rough but
strong shelter over the pigpen listen-
ing the while to the excited chattering
of his brown-skinned crew

  the seas in which the colleen traded
have been notoriously unsafe for small
sailing craft since the days of the mo-
guls sea dyaks of piratical ancestry
in their swift proas lurked below every
sea line that opened to view only let
a sailing vessel drift into a calm within
sight of- the coast and her reinsurance
would be worth a premium captain
lavin had reason to know this having
lost the colleens predecessor -in a hot
scrap with dyak pirates himself re-
maining the sole survivor after a ten-
mile swim in the darkness of a thun-
derous night

  only his irish obstinacy coupled with
his irish grit kept him in so hazard-
ous a business only the fact that his
grit was as great as his obstinacy had
hitherto plucked him out of bad messes
his obstinacy had plunged him into

  on this present voyage against his
mates earnest advice he had shipped
as serang or native bosn the evil-
visaged dyak who now held the crew

under his fiery oratory in the bows
since leaving his last port where the
pig had come aboard the sullen obedi-
ence which had marked the crew hith-
erto was intensified into seething unrest
that culminated in sundry attempts on
the pigs innocent life

  forbidden by their religion to touch
the unclean beast the crew resorted to
cunning schemes to compass his de-
mise  and the attempt that had but now
almost succeeded was the answer they
gave to an order that they clean out
the pigpen

  the skippers ears were open while
he tinkered at the pen and as the dyaks
inflammatory harangue rose to an un-
guarded shriek the most vital passages
smote on his ears with something as
near to a shock as lavin was capable
of experiencing

  paddy slowly hoisted himself erect
and took a long keen look around the
horizon the sea line was unbroken
save for a purple blur in the northeast
that might be a cloud or the loom of
land as yet below the horizon

  he sent a glance aft the stolid
dutchman was apparently deaf to the
voices forward for he stumped the
short poop with hunched shoulders
hands in pockets peering into the com-
pass at every turn glancing aloft at
the topsls at each pause and punctuat-
ing his walk with a sidelong jerk of his
thick neck to squirt a long thin stream
of tobacco juice far over the lee rail
zim had made his protest the rest was
up to his skipper

  lavin picked up the block from the
deck displayed it ostentatiously as he
stepped to the rigging and slowly
mounted to the main crosstrees to re-
place it for a moment the crew stared
at such an unheard-of proceeding on
the part of their skipper then applied
themselves anew with cunning gri-
maces to the dyaks fervid oration

  at the masthead lavin commanded
a wider sweep of ocean far down in


peoples

the west the sea blazed like molten
brass the sinking sun threw its vivid
coloring over an expanse of oily calm
the faint air that barely gave steerage-
way to the schooner was but the dying
breath of a sick breeze she too would
lie motionless as a log before darkness
fell upon her

  snatching his binoculars from his
pocket the skipper swept the farthest
point of the horizon his gaze dwelt
for several moments in the west with
a deep curse he snapped the glasses
shut and slipped down a back stay to
the deck

  he shot an order to the mate who in
reply sent the malay seaman forward
and took the nigh useless wheel him-
self with a smirk of indulgence for
another of the skippers oddities of
fancy then lavin stepped into the
companionway and entered the little
cabin where soft-footed wooden-faced
soon wat flitted from table to pantry
setting out supper

  stooard you savvee kill pig sug-
gested the skipper softly

  sabbee plenty fine all ri capen
admitted soon wat with a smileless
shrug

  spose can kill him so he no squeak
lillee bit the tone was anxious

  can do easy hit him one time on
head wit lillee chippee hammer he go

sleep then- soon wat finished

his illustration with an expressive
sweep of the big carving knife across
his own throat

  good  approved the skipper then
stand by as soon as suppers cleared
up and dont let the crew see you
take the pig out o th pen

  lavin added some whispered instruc-
tions that brought a gleam into soon
wats almond eyes which was as near
to a smile as that wooden face could
compass then he rejoined the mate and
waited for supper to be announced
the fore deck was deserted now the
crew were getting their own evening

meal and a buzz of droning voices
floated up through the tiny focsle scut-
tle and mingled strangely with the
growing squealing of tackles and creak-
ing of structure that filled the schooner
now that the breeze had left her and
she swung dizzily across the swell

  the swift descent of a tropical night
left the decks in gloom fifteen minutes
after the sun sank below the hard-ruled
sea line and soon wat reported sup-
per the skipper took a final look
around and went to snatch a hurried
meal leaving the mate with a job to
occupy him and starting the steward
on his own little task

  give dinny th wallop now he
ordered finish th job in th lazaret
an you zim git th empty tar barl
up an dump some oakum into it dont
let that dyak put a hand to anything
an kape ivery yaller dog away frum
th pigpen theres a proa way down
in th west an pullin this way wid
sweeps shell be hours befoor she
comes up wid us but the dyak is ex-
pectin her mate

  whin she runs alongside yell see
some sport so dont bodder wid thim
swine farard zimmy only kape yer
gun handy in case that brown pirate
gits gay befoor were ready fer him

  soon wat gave the pig swift dis-
patch and vanished below with his vic-
tim under his arm before any of the
crew came on deck not a sound had
escaped the stunned pig to attract at-
tention the pain of his broken leg
had kept him whimpering and now that
his whining had ceased for good the
manifold and increasing noises of the
becalmed vessel prevented the sudden
cessation from being noticed

  the stolid mate while in the dark
regarding his skippers notion was
good officer enough to obey without
question and good man enough to back
his skipper to the human limit

  the malay crew filed on deck at the
heels of their dyak leader and stood
the skippers pig



clustered in a dark mob on the lee or
blind side of the idle foresail that
they were but working up courage for
mischief the mate was convinced he
called softly through the cabin skylight
for the steward to pass him up a hand-
ful of cold food and planted himself
at the lee main rigging with a sandwich
of salt horse in one fist and the snug
butt of a forty-five in the other

  lavin joined him immediately and
scanned the heavens in impatience for
the rising of the moon the murmur of
voices in the gloom forward broke into
jerky patches of argument the dyaks
scornful tones blazed frequently into
angry threats his audience seemed to
be divided among themselves as to the
degree of allegiance they owed him

  murdher swore the skipper fer-
vidly as snatches of talk reached his
ears me noble dyak aint goin to
wait till the proa shows up if he kin
whip thim yaller hounds into motion
listen to him will ye here zim-
jist kape yer gun pinted giniralloike
on thim scum oim goin to lug th
dyak out be th ears

  the skipper sidled along the side op-
posite to that on which the crew stood
bunched with jute-soled shoes and
stealthy tread he reached the fore rig-
ging and clambered noiselessly aloft
crossing over at the lower masthead
he swung off by a backstay and slid
down until he hung plumb over the
crowd

  the dyaks gestures showed that he
had worked himself up to the climax
of his harangue his malay mates
shuffled apart in little knots jabbering
excitedly the weaker-willed were re-
luctantly giving way to the arguments
of the stronger

  lavins ears burned furiously as he
caught scraps of the talk to hear the
murder of himself and his mate dis-
cussed right under his nose was a new
sensation his hot irish blood forced
an oath from his lips and the chatter-

ing crowd beneath him started apart in
terror

 the dyak sprang aside gazing
around everywhere except aloft and in
the moment of surprise like a gorilla
out of a treetop two hundred pounds
of fighting irishman dropped fair upon
the treacherous rascals shoulders

  zim voog from the obscurity of the
poop could be certain of but one thing
in place of a jabbering mob of mal-
contents now out in the darkness for-
ard rolled a biting kicking cursing ball
that language alone indicated to be
lavin and the dyak the crew al-
ready worked up to a state of nerves by
the unclean presence of the pig shot be-
low as the skipper dropped convinced
that a visitation had come upon them
for their attempts on the porkers life

  there was nothing to keep the mate
aft the vessel swung and rolled aim-
lessly to a glassy swell her head point-
ing all around the compass as the
sounds of strife grew fiercer and rolled
nearer zim hauled out his gun and
stepped cautiously toward the noise

  kape out dont shoot snarled
lavin between fierce gasps i got a

better notion than killin th divil-

ah ye murdherin pirate

  even in the blackness of the bulwark
shadow zim had caught the flash of
steel lavins exclamation followed the
thrust of a creese and now the handle
of the dyaks weapon stuck out from
his shoulder like a clothes peg

  roll oudt skipper growled the
mate dodging around the grappled pair
with pistol shoved forward roll oudt
till i poomp him full mit leadt

  nix barked lavin panting oive
got him fast ye kin pull this dam

knife out though-thats it pull-

oh pull blasht ye ow roight
zimmy now git out till oi shcrag th
skunk

  a sudden glow suffused the sea as the
moon broke through the heat haze hang-
ing low on the horizon her beams


peoples

touched the schooner throwing fleeting
shafts of silvery light athwart the decks
as the little craft rolled and dipped to
the heave of ocean

  one such shaft of light fell upon
the combatants and the mate stood
back satisfied the dyaks spine was
bent bow shape over the bitts one of
lavins bony knees seemed to have be-
come rooted in the mans solar plexus
both of the skippers steel-muscled
hands were joined in a grip upon the
brown throat and the light shone upon
staring eyeballs set horribly prominent
in a mask of mortal terror

  now git th handcuffs an leg irons
zimmy panted lavin rising as his
antagonist sagged supinely under his
hands shackle him up to th forestay
whoile oi git this hole in me showlder
plugged up

 when the skipper came on deck
again after having soon wat bandage
his wounded shoulder the moon was
flooding the sea with brilliance the
mate locked the irons of the dyak
around the wire forestay and finished
the job by dashing a couple of buckets
of water over him

  the schooner lay directly in the path
of moonlight and as their eyes be-
came accustomed to the change from
black darkness skipper and mate could
see down at the end of the shaft of
moonlight a dark speck that seemed to
grow as they watched it

  soon wat emerged from the com-
panionway fifteen minutes later wiping
his hands on his apron and spoke to
the skipper

  roight said lavin a wide grin
lighting his face  here zim he
called to the mate break out a keg o
powdher an give it the stooard as
the mate disappeared below he added
to soon wat an whin its ready
put dinny back in his pen an stay wid
him savvy

  all ri-me sabbee grinned the
steward and followed the mate

  the skipper stood alone again and
with the nearer approach of the distant
dark speck impatience gripped him
focusing his night glass upon the
speck he made her out to be unmis-
takably a dyak proa with brown mat
sails hanging idly from her long slop-
ing yards urged forward slowly by a
pair of heavy sweeps

  she was within a scant mile now and
in the continued absence of wind would
be up with the schooner in half an hour
even should a breeze strike down
lavin knew the sailing qualities of such
craft well enough to feel certain that
his vessel stood no chance with the proa
in anything less than a half gale

  forward he saw the heads of the
crew bob up from the focsle one after
another until the whole crowd stood
huddled just abaft the forestay a muf-
fled whispering carried aft to him and
breaking in on it the hoarse voice of
the half-choked dyak vouched for that
worthys tenacious hold on life

  lavin strolled forward quietly ap-
parently aimlessly the feeling of the
malays showed itself in the alacrity
with which every brown head bobbed
back through the tiny scuttle and lavin
returned to the poop with a guffaw of
hilarity his mirth was increased by
the fervid torrent of invective poured
out upon the skulkers by the ironed
dyak

  the mate rejoined him shortly and
on his heels came soon wat the
steward carried a burden placed it in
the pigpen and disappeared therein
himself voog caught sight of the proa
now plainly visible to the naked eye
and looked at the skipper for enlight-
enment

  got yer gun  asked lavin shortly

  yaw grunted zim but two guns
aindt wort mooch to fight dem-

  sit tight zimmy sit tight advised
lavin measuring with his eye the dis-
tance of the proa now sweeping down
upon the starboard bow
the skippers pig



  just watch me son the dyaks

  veil sposin de virevorks dondt

stop dem veu pe-

  they will shut up snapped la-
vin stepping down to the main deck
as the proa rasped alongside and the
clank of the grappling iron was heard
at the bows come on

  the proa had crept up with a spurt in
the last few fathoms and the tar barrel
blazed up as the vessels touched now
a wide circle of glaring yellow light
rendered the scene as bright as day and
the chained dyak shrieked a greeting
to his countrymen in the proa bidding
them swarm in and butcher the schoon-
ers helpless whites

  the malays took heart again and
with the first sound of boarding
trooped up from the forecastle and
joined the dyaks for a murderous rush
aft at a command from the chained
dyak the pirates passed arms to the
malays and now fear fled from their
swart faces as each wiry arm flourished
a wicked wavy-bladed creese

  now gritted lavin leading the
way followed closely by the mate he
charged forward blazing into the mob
until his gun was empty for an in-
stant the pirates backed and stood
bunched in the bows then they real-
ized that the white men were helpless
until they could reload their weapons
and a howl pealed out upon the still air
as the dyak lashed them to fury for
an annihilating onslaught

  what lavin had foreseen happened
a creese blade flashed through the rope

lanyard of the forestay and with a
shriek of triumph the dyak sprang
erect shaking aloft his irons and gath-
ering himself to lead the rush

  his leg irons stopped him for an in-
stant and he fell bringing his follow-
ers together in a huddled mob as he
shrieked to them to lift him up it was
the crucial moment

  now again barked lavin flour-
ishing his empty revolver and starting
another rush as he passed the pig-
pen the mate hard at his heels the
skipper shot a sharp command into the
dimmest corner of dennis late home
and halted suddenly at the foremast

  a brown wave of howling blood-
thirsty dyaks hung poised on the edge
of the little focsle head every glaring
eye and frothing mouth vividly visible
in the light of the blazing tar barrel and
the silvery sheen of an electric moon

  the mates face registered doubt as
to what was to come next mixed with
anger at the skippers foolhardy throw-
ing away of their lives-then fear as
the pirates gathered to rush

  hooroar howled the skipper smit-
ing his pop-eyed mate hard on the back
and dancing with glee lookit

  from the darkness of the pigpen
soared a black shape it sailed over
their heads and as it went every eye
saw the rotund form of the skippers
pig breathing sparks and smoke
through its nostrils

  for five seconds it sailed through the
air scattering a stream of sputtering
sparks and emitting the sulphurous
reek of hades then with a heavy
thud the body fell among the startled
pirates and a howl of superstitious ter-
ror burst from the schooners malay
crew as they scuttled below like one
man then came the climax

  with the roar of a bursting shell the
pig exploded a flash blazed out that
blanketed the light of barrel and moon
one cry of terror went up from the
huddled pirates it gave way to frenzied


peoples

moans of agony as the fiercely blazing
wads of oakum with which the pigskin
had been packed flew into the faces of
those nearest

  the dyak hurled far aft by the
force of the explosion fell at the skip-
pers feet his face blasted beyond any
semblance to human features and from
the bows sounded the frantic efforts of
the proas surviving crew to haul their
vessel clear

  soon wats wooden face peered over
the edge of the pigpen and from some
hidden recess of his being a smile es-
caped it spread over his yellow fea-
tures like a pantomime mask zim
voog stood with open mouth arms
hanging loosely at his side almost as
scared as the pirates

  hustle now and put out the blaze 

snapped lavin jumping forward and
stamping on the fiery wads he stopped
to empty his recharged gun after the
hastily receding proa

  then putting bis head down the
focsle scuttle he hailed the malays
did they want to work they did if
that debbil soor was locked up
would they ever try to kill the skip-
pers pig again  they would not
they onlywanted protection from its
wrath theyd surely be good

  all right grinned the kipper
up ye come ye yaller rats

  he laid a powder-grimed hand on the
mates shoulder and sang out to soon
wat so that his badly shaken mate
could fully appreciate his words

a grave situation

by harvey l gray

joe surveyed his possessions first to meet his eyes was the potato
field with its well-ordered rows of plants showing excellent mid-june
development but joe ungrateful to nature failed to enthuse over
his bumper potato crops while he went on growing potatoes he
had another ambition which greatly overshadowed potato cultivation

when you can show something
tangible-say a couple of
thousand dollars in the bank
and some established business bringing
in a steady income-then and not until
then will i consent to your marriage
to gertrude john p crowinshield
leaned back in his easy-chair with
an assured that-settles-it air and
frowned with paternal patronage upon
joseph bender a youth of twenty-five
years who being in love with crowin-
shields only daughter had called to
speak to father

  now john p crowinshield was a
substantial citizen and as president of
the only national bank in the county

chairman for the twelfth consecutive
time of the board of selectmen owner
of vast timberlands a sawmill and a
large prosperous farm he had come to
realize in no uncertain way that his
word while not law exactly was
universally respected naturally of
course he supposed that his present
caller would accept his manifesto

  nevertheless young bender un-
bearded and surprisingly youthful in
appearance actually had the audacity
to question tbe wisdom of the state-
ment concerning the two thousand and
a steady income in fact he showed
unusual spirit and lack of awe in stat-
ing his case
a grave situation



  two thousand dollars my necktie
he exclaimed irreverently all you
need is confidence and grit with such
a smart girl as gertie to help me id
have that two thousand in  time-
and -add more for good measure id
turn this county upside down why

that little farm of mine-

   that little farm of yours  broke
in the father of gertrude with de-
termination is a minor factor in this
case for heaven sake son do you
think for a minute that id let you start
gertie off on that little place of yours
to help you feed your hens-or help
you hoe potatoes  why its ridicu-
lous on the face of it what have you
accomplished in the three years since
your father died and left you the place
answer me that

  joe hitched himself into a fighting
attitude and raised a chubby forefinger

  ive accomplished this he began
eagerly ive laid the foundations for
the finest little poultry business youve

ever seen ive-

  chickens-a business exploded
the older man with sarcasm why
when i was a young man the women-
folks raised chickens for pin money
that isnt a business-its a fad started
by some back-to-the-farni crank draw-
ing pay from a city newspaper pish
things have changed since you
were a young man objected joe
sturdily

  hens have changed precious little
in that time answered the other
somewhat pleased with the sentiment

  theres money in it insisted joe
doggedly

  that said crowinsliield is a
question which has never been settled
beyond a reasonable doubt he smiled
easily besides he added gertie
would tire of the life within a year it
would be too much of a change from
her present surroundings

  joe frowned for a moment then
brightened

     

  why not let gertie decide for her-
self he suggested turning to the cor-
ner where gertie sat expectantly wait-
ing shes twenty and she knows
her own mind gerties father laughed
indulgently

  gerties in love said he and at
the present time i havent a doubt but
that she would go to zululand if you
wished she dont know her own mind
yet

  oh dont she though exclaimed
gertrude with spirit well if a girl
doesnt know whom she wants to marry
when shes twenty then she never will
whats more ive half a mind to marry
joe without your mean old consent

  her father rose crossed the room
slowly and laid a hand upon her
shoulder

  gertie he said softly i would do
anything within reason to make you
happy you are all that i have dear
furthermore i like joe and i have
 objections to your marriage to him
-at the proper time hes a good lad
only hes not far enough along in life
to afford a wife just wait a while
and then when the right time comes
both of you will thank me for offering
this advice at any rate he added his
lips tightening firmly further talk 
this subject is useless you must wait
that settles it

  after a violent discussion lasting
fully an hour both young people de-
spite their mutinous opinions were
forced to see that the fathers word
did settle it

  after a nights sleep joe albeit
somewhat sour over his unsuccessful
interview with his would-be father-in-
law was compelled to admit at least to
a portion of his wisdom then being
joe bender and springing from stern
new england stock he set about him
for means to bring his requirements up
to the necessary standard

  as he sat  f the back steps of his


peoples

home enjoying his after-breakfast pipe
he took a mental inventory of his vis-
ible assets they consisted of the farm
of twenty acres saddled with a nine-
hundred-dollar mortgage a good house
and barn a horse wagon and some
farm equipment and about four hun-
dred industrious hens ten of his
twenty acres comprised the best potato
field in town if not in the county in
addition to this he had a balance of
about three hundred dollars in the
bank his net earnings for the past year

  not what youd call a cheerful lay-
out observed joe as he puffed re-
flectively at his pipe still it could be
worse

  joe surveyed his possessions first
to meet his eyes was the potato field
with its well-ordered rows of plants
showing excellent mid-june develop-
ment the spring following his fathers
death joe had planted the piece to po-
tatoes as an experiment before that
time it had been an indifferent corn-
field the result was more than grati-
fying and when harvest time came the
field was the envy of every farmer who
knew of the place and particularly of
amos studley joes next-door neigh-
bor a middle-aged farmer of some
means who was a crank on potatoes

  yet joe ungrateful to nature failed
to enthuse over his bumper potato
crops while he went on growing po-
tatoes he had another ambition which
greatly overshadowed potato cultiva-
tion his heart was with his hens and
his gaze turned from the potato field
to the other half of his farm where his
feathered friends were scattered about
busily scratching and digging his
look was one of fondness it was his
ambition to establish a large modern
and scientific poultry farm run on a
profitable basis he had faith in the
idea and also the whole-souled support
of gertrude crowinshield

  there was some foundation to joes
ambition he had a way with hens

which had returned him a neat little
profit from his small brood but he
looked higher he wanted to possess
two or three thousand hens housed in
modern pens equipped with sanitary
runs feeding troughs arjd the like but
such an establishment cost money he
knew and money was the one means
of barter that joe had not he was
confident however that eventually he
would be able to gratify his ambitions

  as joe bestirred himself about his
days work an automobile swung into
the yard on two wheels and slid on
locked wheels almost to the barn door
before it came to a stop the driver
a dapper young man of perhaps thirty
years stalled his engine and alighted
joe recognized him as henry clay bar-
num an intensely enthusiastic young
person endowed with considerable
wealth who went in for things on a
huge farm a mile or so up the road
his hobbies ranged from prize cattle to
bees and he changed from one to the
other whenever a new idea assailed him
his changing moods kept his friends
dizzy just now he was raising poultry
on a large scale-fact is everything he
did was on a large scale incidentally
he was particularly fond of joes com-
pany and had hindered that young man
not a little by stealing him away from
his work during the busy seasons to go
hunting or fishing

 this morning he was unusually
blithesome and joe sighed it was
probable he thought that the fish were
biting like the devil-or some other rea-
sonably good excuse for putting off a
days work

  im sorry hank said joe follow-
ing this line of reasoning but im too
blamed busy to get away this morning

  oh thats all right answered bar-
num brightly as he pulled off his driv-
ing gloves and fished for a cigarette
im not going to interfere with your
work this morning im here on busi-
ness in fact-i might as well get it
a grave situation

 i

over with at once-i came to tell you
that im going out of the hen industry
the announcement did not surprise
joe any he had expected it to come
at some time or other nevertheless
he experienced a slight pang of envy
joe had been of material aid to bar-
num when that impetuous person had
disposed of a whole trainload of hogs
to take up the business of making hens
lay he had chosen most of the equip-
ment for his friend and superintended
its installation when complete it em-
braced all of the ideas joe entertained
for his own place if his means ever
permitted now that the equipment
was for sale he bemoaned the fact that
he was unable to buy it

  yes repeated barnum im going
to raise airesdales-dogs you know-
and im going to let you have the poul-
try layout hens and all

  joe jumped it was too good to be
true he held out his hand impetu-
ously

  you can have it barnum went on
for eight hundred dollars-cash
joes face lost its smile

  why cash he demanded with a
frown you infernal hog youve got
more money than coal oil johnny
oh have i  barnum wanted to
know well you have another guess
my son at the present time i couldnt
lay my hands on five hundred dollars
i could rightfully call my own that
vast amount of wealth you allude to is
held in trust dammit and its doled out
in semioccasional spoonfuls theres
nothing due for several months and
i simply must have eight hundred im-
mediately if not sooner

  why demanded joe

  why because explained bar-
num impatiently that new york dog
fancier refuses to talk business with me
unless i can scare up three thousand
dollars he fails to be impressed with
my line of credit you see said he
taking from his pockets a mass of

literature appertaining to that breed
of dogs known as airedales fairly
teeming with the words sired and
dammed theres money in these
dogs-

  sure sure interrupted joe some-
what sharply i know but what i
want to know is why cant you let me
have that poultry equipment of yours
on a note say for three months six
months or a year

  nothing doing on the time joe
answered barnum positively jenkins
must have cash for his pups so i must
have cash for my hens why he
exclaimed suddenly you could raise
eight hundred on this jewel of a farm
without an effort joe laughed rue-
fully

  unfortunately said he theres a
little parasite on this jewel of a farm
already- inherited it but he added
hopefully perhaps i could raise the
money in some other way will you
give me an option

  barnum considered this carefully
it might be arranged said he my
option for the dogs is only for a month
you know he smiled and eyed joe
shrewdly fred rand has made me
an offer he observed joe started

  ill give you twenty dollars for a
two weeks option be offered his man-
ner changed now that rand was a
factor be would raise the money if he
bad to steal it rand it might be
added at one time attempted to win
away from joe the love of gertrude
crowinshield with disastrous results to
rands right eye since then there had
been a coolness between them

  twenty dollars for an option re-
peated joe impatiently how about
it

  done exclaimed barnum now
rustle around for that twenty im in
a hurry and mind you he added
turning from the operation of crank-
ing his automobile two weeks is all
youll get although you and i are


peoples

good friends ill sell out to rand if you
dont get the coin business is busi-
ness

  thats fair enough said joe
only dont trouble yourself about
rand he added grimly ill get the

money

  when he considered means of rais-
ing money joes mind turned instantly
to amos studley regardless of the fact
that their relations never had been what
you might call neighborly they sel-
dom met but to quarrel usually about
joes potato field and usually during
these discussions amos lost his tem-
per secretly joe maintained a liking
for his choleric neighbor while deep
down in his heart amos nursed an
admiration for the youthful bender
therefore joe decided without hesi-
tation that amos should purchase his
potato field

  three elements entered into joes de-
termination to sell his land to studley
first studleys potato field adjoined
the parcel of property he wished to sell
secondly amos made a specialty of po-
tatoes  and thirdly amos had plenty
of money these arguments were un-
answerable thought joe

  ten minutes after barnum had left
joe crossed his field and found stud-
ley instructing two swarthy sons of
italy in the art of applied hoeing ap-
parently the lesson had not been won-
derfully successful for the farmers
wrinkled face was flushed had joe
been less engrossed in his big idea
he might have scented an impending
squall and waited for a more favorable
moment to broach his proposition in-
stead he sailed blindly but enthusi-
astically ahead

  got five minutes amos he asked

  amos eyed his neighbor silently for
a moment then walked off a few paces

  i spose he began with a frown
that youve come over here to kick

about one of my cows getting into your
field  he looked up expectantly

  nothing like that answered joe
with a short laugh ive come over on
business amos stiffened

  oh business said he with fine
sarcasm now why didnt you men-
tion that in the first place you would
have saved time for both of us he
frowned for a moment waal

  joe spat accurately at a potato bug
ground the enemy into the earth with
his heel and cleared his throat

  amos he said i want to get rid
of my potato field twenty-four hun-
dred dollars and its yours how about
it shall i see about the deeds to-day
you shall not answered amos pos-
itively i dont want your blamed old
potato field i might take it as a gift
because its good potato land but as
for buying it-he laughed shortly-
not on your life ive got troubles
enough now he started back toward
the laborers but joe restrained him
with a firm hand upon his shoulder

  not so fast amos he protested
i need the money and i could get
along without the land you could
spare the money and could use the land
to good advantage it adjoins your own
potato field think it over

  ive thought it over all im a-goin
to answered amos shaking off the
hand i tell ye i dont want the land
whether ive got the money or not aint
got anything to do with it i dont
want any more land and whats more
no man is goin to force his potato fields
down my windpipe he regarded joe
defiantly joe regarded him silently for
a moment then his face hardened

  amos said he when i try to force
land on another man ill not be in my
right mind its a straight business
deal with me every time and let me
tell you be added bis voice rising in-
dignantly youll have to get down on
your knees and beg before ill sell you
that land now he snapped his fin-
a crave situation



gers disdainfully and departed with his
head in the air

  amos regarded him for a moment
then cackled the knees of my pants
wont bag fer some time he remarked
dryly

  joe returned to his work with anger
in his heart and although he worked
with feverish energy until late in the
afternoon he could not shake off his
feeling of resentment after a hearty
supper however as he sat on his fa-
vorite spot on the back steps smok-
ing he cooled off somewhat he racked
his brain for means of disposing of his
land or some other way of raising eight
hundred dollars he went to bed with-
out a solution

  for ten days joe tried every scheme
he could think of to raise money he
centered his energies in an effort to sell
the potato field but failed to get a bite
a young married man from the city
visited town in search of a small place
joe promptly collared him and took
him out to his place no house went
with the field however and the stran-
ger politely declined to buy

  joe tried the national bank but john
p crowinshield spiked that gun he
laid a fatherly hand on joes shoulder
and advised him not to fool with sec-
ond mortgages he didnt want to see
joe get in too deep he explained

  undiscouraged joe sought henry
craig an old family friend who with
his wife and widowed daughter lived
in the north part of the town craig
listened politely then shook his head

  but this is such a beautiful oppor-
tunity explained joe in despair

  im sorry joe answered craig
but i cant do it if you were in real
trouble id be only too glad to help you
but this is different win that girl
with your own wits and muscles joe
not with a friends money

  joe drove home in gloomy spirits he
was not discouraged but for the life

of him he could not figure out where
that eight hundred dollars was coming
from however he still hoped that op-
portunity would knock at his door be-
fore the option expired

  opportunity arrived the middle of the
next forenoon while joe was repairing
a henhouse it came from town in an
automobile and amid a cloud of dust
barnum played the role unconsciously
and entered the yard ignorant of the
fact that he was to act the part of the
good angel

  ah there joe said he briskly as
he hopped out of his pulsating motor
car just thought id stop off and
spread a little gossip he laughed
softly theres a merry row up-
town he said

  uh hull answered joe continuing
his work on the henhouse

  were going to have a new ceme-
tery said barnum

  a what

  a cemetery place where they bury
people you idiot exclaimed barnum
with good-natured impatience lem-
me explain father murphy of all
saints church has just awoke to the
fact that his dead parishoners are scat-
tered about the township sort of pro-
miscuouslike as you might say and he
cant see the fitness of it he wants
an honest-to-goodness regulation cem-
etery same as the other churches have

  what is there scandalous about
that asked joe

  theres no objection to his having
a cemetery answered barnum no-
body cares a hang if he has a dozen of
them what theyre frothing at the
mouth about is the fact that he has his
eyes on the old dean place

  the deuce you say exclaimed joe
shocked

  the same said barnum you
can imagine the outbreak that greeted
that bit of news jim dean you know
is so mean that hed die happy if lie
could only put something over on his


peoples

fellow townsmen poor father mur-
phy didnt stop to consider that the old
dean place was the first place in town
to be cleared back in the days of the
indians i didnt know about it myself
until recently

  well demanded joe what are
they going to do about it

  oh they protested answered the
other with a laugh yes indeed they
certainly did protest father murphy
met them fairly but his parishoners
didnt fancy the tone of the protest
cant say as i blame em at that you
cant beat the average new englander
in stating hard cold facts in a way that
will not fail to be understood the
average corn-fed has a tongue about as
soft as cold steel

  but tell me insisted joe impa-
tiently whats the answer

  a compromise answered barnum
and youve got to band it to the fa-
ther for being a good scout hes of-
fered to let his option slide if some-
body will find him a satisfactory sub-
stitute for the dean place he did
more he offered two hundred dollars
to the man whod find it for him
hows that for a fair offer eh

  joe puffed his pipe thoughtfully for
a moment then slowly a grin spread
over his face he looked at barnum
and laughed

 well wh- began barnum puz-
zled but joe interrupted

  when you left town asked joe
had anybody produced a cemetery 
no exclaimed barnum in disgust
not even a gravestone those peo-
ple uptown are like reform politicians
they try murder on the slightest provo-
cation and then fail to carry out their
bluff why

  because answered joe dropping
his hammer and making for the barn
ill save them the bother

  joe hitched up his horse and drove
directly to the parish house of all

saints church where he was closeted
with father murphy for over an hour
he emerged smiling shook bands with
the parish priest and took the steps in
a jump as he went briskly through
the gate he almost collided with amos
studley

  joe beamed upon his neighbor with
extreme good humor past differences
so far as he was concerned were for-
given

  fine day said he as he hopped
into his buggy

  jus so muttered amos as joe
drove off he paused a moment and
gazed at the retreating buggy puzzled
he wondered-but it was too prepos-
terous he dismissed the thought
from his mind and walked on

  meantime joe drove out to see henry
craig he found that gentleman en-
gaged far out in a cornfield joe talked
steadily while henry listened at first
he frowned in perplexity then he
grinned and bit off a chew of honey
dew before joe finished talking he
was laughing and he was laughing long
after joe had driven off

  amos studley going out to feed his
stock early the following morning
stopped short halfway between the
house and barn and stared a strange
sight greeted his eyes

  what the devil he exclaimed the
cause of this outburst was joe bender
a notoriously late riser performing
strange antics out in his potato field
under one arm he carried a bunch of
roughly hewed stakes while in the other
hand he carried a hatchet he would
pace off a distance drive a stake pace
off another distance and drive another
stake this he continued for upward
of an hour until the entire field was
dotted with stakes

  amos found time to watch his young
neighbor occasionally as he performed
his morning work he saw joe drive
off toward town about eight oclock and
a grave situation



abandoned bis work for a moment to
watch him when the buggy had dis-
appeared from view he smiled craftily

  evidently joe dont know the law
he chuckled highly pleased

  nevertheless after his chores were
finished he crossed the field and studied
the stakes with interest thanks to
joes crudity he could make neither
heads or tails out of them after puz-
zling over it for a while amos gave
it up and returned to his work

  joe drove back from town about an
hour later and in the buggy with him
sat father murphy amos ever watch-
ful witnessed the arrival and covertly
watched them from a sheltered spot
the two men walked slowly about the
field joe doing most of the talking and
much pointing while the priest was con-
tent to listen after a time they
climbed into the buggy and returned to
town

  throughout the performance in the
field amos had chuckled softly to him-
self now that they were gone amos
seated himself upon his front veranda
and waited when joe returned about
an hour later aloue amos strolled out
to the road to meet him

  just wanted a minutes talk with
ye he explained as joe halted his
horse in response to an upraised hand
joe waited expectantly

  well

  hmm began amos a crafty smile
playing over his features see you
had a visitor this morning joes face
cleared and he smiled

   oh yes said he father murphy
was out here on a little matter of busi-
ness amos also smiled but his fea-
tures hardened somewhat

  aimin to sell that tract of yours to
him fer a cemetery i suppose

  we discussed it joe admitted
amos face lost its smile and he hitched
himself closer

  do you happen to know he de-
manded raising a soiled forefinger

that when a passel of land is set aside
for a cemetery the consent of the abut-
ters must be secured before the deeds
can be passed

  i surely wouldnt attempt to sell a
piece of land for such a purpose with-
out first acquainting myself with the
law answered joe pleasantly

  waal amos punctuated each word
carefully im goin to break some
news to ye the fact is i aint a-goin
to give my consent do  make myself
puffictly clear

  absolutely said joe but you
see amos your consent isnt neces-
sary

  it aint eh exploded amos
waal now i guess im goin to have
a whole lot to say about it  jest you go
about plantin a cemetery under my
nose an see ef i dont make my con-
sent necessary he shot a look of
venom at his youthful neighbor and
the light of battle blazed in his eyes
joe returned the gaze calmly and pro-
ceeded to fill his pipe when he had
it going to his satisfaction he ventured
a reply

  i repeat said he that your con-
sent is not necessary you set he
went on holding up a restraining hand
to hush an impending protest when
i staked out the place this morning i
laid out a twenty-foot street between
your property and mine both at the side
and in the rear my plan is to have a
chapel at the rear of the lot and the
street will lead up to it so you see
that street removed you quite effec-
tively as an abutter thats plain aint
it

  amos stared at his neighbor glassily
bereft of speech slowly the light of
battle faderl from his eyes he rallied
for a moment however

  you cant do it he said bravely

  oh yes  can answered joe with
a boyish smile of triumph amos was
helpless


peoples

  would you treat a neighbor like
that joe  lie asked huskily

  business is business answered joe
grimly and besides i need the
money

  but joe- objected amos then

suddenly his manner changed come
into the house he directed hastily
joe with a covert smile climbed down
from the buggy and followed amos
into the house

  now said amos as they seated
themselves at an ancient desk lets talk
business i guess youre right about
that street business and the only thing
left for me to do is to buy joe shook
his head

  cant be done said he firmly
you must remember that father mur-
phy has a prior right in this matter
besides he added with a grim tight-
ening of the lips perhaps you have
forgotten our former interview on this
subject you were positively nasty
about it then amos i remember dis-
tinctly telling you-

  now look you here joe amos
protested let bygones be bygones and
look at this thing sensibly you know
i cant have a cemetery under my very
nose-

  youre no worse off than i am in-
terrupted joe with a smile

  that may be all right answered
amos but-think of it a cemetery 
why my wife would leave me in a
minute now wait a bit he pleaded
as joe made an effort to interrupt again
theres lots of other places father
murphy could use as a cemetery and
they wont bother anybody forget
that little spat we had the other day
and sell that land to me if you must
sell it father murphy will under-
stand

  joe considered this carefully i
dont know he worried ive given
father murphy to understand-

  thats all right amos cut in he
saw that joe was wavering you can

fix it up with him if you cant then
i will ill see him myself

  joe gazed thoughtfully at the ceiling
for a moment then reluctantly he gave
in

  there exclaimed amos i feel
better already get your papers fixed
up and ill hand you a check for
twenty-four hundred-

  three thousand corrected joe
sharply

  eh amos looked up in surprise
three thousand you said twenty-
four hundred the other day i dis-
tinctly-

  my figure to father murphy was 
three thousand answered joe firmly
amos laid down the pen he had been
toying with

  why that land aint wuth that much
money joe he protested

  maybe it aint to you answered
joe but-

  all right said amos hastily
make it three thousand but-be
eyed joe sternly-it aint wuth it-you
know it aint

  at precisely ten oclock of the morn-
ing following amos who with joe had
been over legal documents in the office
of jefferson smiley an aged attorney
arose and eyed joe triumphantly

  that settles your little cemetery
business he said as he thrust some
legal papers into his wallet joe was
about to voice a rejoinder when the
outer door of the office opened to ad-
mit the reverend thomas murphy rec-
tor of all saints church he was ac-
companied by henry craig puffing con-
tentedly at a long cigar greetings
over joe and craig joined in confer-
ence with the lawyer

  amos and father murphy left to
their own devices met in the center of
the room

  well father began amos pleas-
antly albeit a trifle constrained ill
have to admit that i played you a rather
a grave situation



shabby trick the clergyman elevated
his eyebrows in surprise

  i dont believe i quite understand
said he mystified

  why about joes land explained
amos now you understand he
continued in a low tone i really
couldnt have a cemetery right in my
front yard so i just got in ahead of
you and bought the property i have
the deeds in my pocket now

  the priest frowned in perplexity a
moment then slowly his expression
changed and a smile played about his
features his eyes twinkled and he
shot an amused glance toward joe
bender

  there must have been a mistake
said he i had no idea of buying joes
property

  eh gasped amos the breath leav-
ing his body for a moment he was
speechless

  see here he exclaimed when he
had regained his speech didnt joe
bender take you out there yesterday
with the idea of selling that place for
a cemetery 

  oh yes answered father murphy
pleasantly but our inspection was
merely perfunctory joe explained be-

fore we went out that it was probable
that the place would not be what i
wanted and as soon as i looked at it i
quite agreed with him then he took
me over to mr craigs place and
showed me a piece of property that just
suited me thats what brings us here
this morning

  why the darned rascal exclaimed
amos i paid him three thousand dol-
lars for that property of his simply be-
cause he said he named that price to
you

  thats right answered the priest
with a laugh he did say his price
was three thousand but he might just
as well have made it a million he
paused as a sudden thought occurred
to him well well he exclaimed in
a pleased tone that makes it nice
hell be able to do it now

  do what asked amos mystified
why get married father mur-
phy explained hes engaged to ger-
trude crowinshield you know

 amos turned slowly and glared
across the room at joe then gradually
his face relaxed and a faint smile of
admiration played in the corners of his
mouth

  hell be a good provider said he

through purgatory

         by joseph ivers lawrence

                          author of the amateur lucher etc

   i shall ride through purgatory my friends on one of my best
   horses-ladybird-and ill wager a thousand dollars with any man here
   that my wife will ride with me and finish the run any takers

twenty-two men and women
sat around the table in the great
beamed and paneled dining room
of the arlings house and partook of
the truffled partridge and champagne
cup provided by their host for the hunt
breakfast ben arling had compounded

the cup with his own hands and his
slightly flushed face and ready laughter
showed that he had sampled it freely
during the process

  tts not very good sport to tell where
the drag has been laid he said in an-
swer to an idle question from a neigh-


peoples

bor but in this case its almost too
good to keep this time i laid the drag
myself and its one of the sportiest
courses i ever laid out we go west
from here over the tomlinson farm-
thats easy-and then we take to the
old drake place from the road and fol-
low the line due south across the place
its a regular steeplechase course in it-
self  i figure that we-ll be pretty well
warmed up by that time and after we
leave the low meadow at the end of
drakes we follow the road for a quar-
ter of a mile and go down the valley be-
low the sawmill

  harry tennant four seats away ut-
tered a smothered exclamation and
leaned forward you dont mean that
youre going to take us through pur-
gatory do you ben he inquired
tensely

  the host grinned and his face was
never pleasant to look at when he
grinned yes im going to take you
through purgatory he answered i
dont think any one will refuse to go
where the m f h leads do you
marshall crossfield arlings prede-
cessor as master of foxhounds of the
westgate hunt set down his glass and
looked up with grave disapprobation
i will follow you to the end of the
drake place ben he said but after
that i shall withdraw from the run and
make no apologies for doing so i
think no one here will question my
courage but i am riding featherheels
this morning and i value his legs as
much as i do my own neck i think too
much of my horse to ride him over the
stones and brush in that valley and the
jumps are all dangerous

  rather unkind of you to bar out
the women in that manner ben spoke
up the dashing mrs winant you evi-
dently want it to be a mans run after
you quit the drake place of course
not a woman will stay after that

  not a woman of course echoed

marshall crossfield with a shake of his
head

  ben arling grinned again i can
speak for one woman he said my
wife will stay with us to the end of the
run and shes riding erebus

  a murmur of astonishment and con-
sternation swept over the company

  peggy arling exclaimed mrs
winant indignantly you cant be such
a fool

  the hostess upon whom all eyes were
now turned flushed deeply then grew
positively pale she had been the beauty
and belle of the community before she
married ben arling but in two years
she had grown to be a white-faced
large-eyed pathetic figure of resigned
unhappiness arling was no longer a
moderate drinker and his affairs
were more numerous than they had
been in the days of his dashing bache-
lorhood

  mrs arling spoke in a low voice i
am going to ride erebus she said but
i didnt know that the drag was laid
through purgatory i thought ben
cared too much for-for his horses to
ride there no -one has ridden there
since tom fielding was killed

  it cant be done ben declared
crossfield stoutly its not good sport
to endanger life and its not good sport
to dare every one to take such a fool-
hardy chance why you wouldnt let
your wife go in there if she really
wanted to do it and youre crazy if you
go yourself

  the whole trouble began with poor
tom fieldings death said arling
with a shrug tom would have had
the same tumble with that horse of his
if he had been riding anywhere else
his horse was done for when he tried
to take the jump his death was shock-
ing of course but the people made too
much fuss about it everybody said
that purgatory was a death trap and
that no one would ever ride there again
well im trying to redeem the poor old
through purgatory



valley if im willing to ride there my-
self and let my wife that shows what i
think about it doesnt it

  ill follow you arling called out
ted braddock just out of college and
desirous of having a voice in affairs

  crossfield frowned upon the young
man contemptuously if you get over
the first jump my boy he remarked
reprovingly well i wont follow you
arling he added as i have already
said and i should hate to think that
mrs arling would do anything so reck-
less

  i didnt expect to stir up such a
tempest said arling evidently not dis-
pleased with the developments i shall
ride through purgatory my friends on
one of my best horses-ladybird-and
ill wager a thousand dollars with any
man here that my wife will ride with
me and finish the run any takers
what an ass gasped crossfield
under his breath to harry tennant be-
side him but tennant who had been a
suitor for mrs arlings hand before her
marriage simply turned a deep red and
gritted his teeth

  mrs winants eyes flashed danger-
ously as she turned upon the host

  id horsewhip a man of mine that
would take as caddish a bet as that ben
arling she cried but as a woman
ill take your bet ill bet you a thou-
sand that peggy doesnt finish the run
she has too much good sense to do such
a thing-on a wild horse at that its
bad enough for you to let her ride ere-
bus but she can do it over fair coun-
try she wont be idiot enough to try
the valley and my thousand is good
enough to say so

  i dont bet with women as a rule
returned arling but youre too good
a sportsman for me to refuse mrs
winant

  peggy he exclaimed boisterously
turning to his wife theres a thousand
up on your sportsmanship old girl ill
back you against any one as the best

horsewoman in the vvestgate hunt ill
trust you with erebus and ill trust
you to ride through purgatory is it
a go 

  a slow smile trembled over the lips
of the hostess-it was the same smile
she had worn when she heard of the
scandal linking her husbands name
with that of a certain woman rather too
well known in society-and she raised
her eyes and met his unfalteringly

  i usually do ride to the end of the
run she said simply in a voice that
was steady but hardly natural and i
shall probably do it to-day if my luck
is with me

  good girl chuckled arling with
his unpleasant grin peggys the kind
of a wife a man can depend on gentle-
men 

  crossfield groaned softly and gripped
tennants knee fiercely under the table
by god harry he muttered that
woman is either crazy or absolutely des-
perate  if she does it its nothing short
of suicide

  murder replied tennant in a
strained whisper which brought cross-
field around facing him with a start

  crossfield opened his lips to speak
again but shut them firmly and shook
his head when he saw the agonized look
upon tennants face it told him more
plainly than words that tennant still
loved peggy arling as much as he did
when he had asked her to marry him
and been refused-more than ben ar-
ling had ever loved her it had been
the love of a good man perhaps too
silent and dignified against the passion
of a smooth-tongued swashbuckling
hero of the moment

  the hostess rose from the table and
in a moment all the pink-coated men
and variously habited women were on
their feet chattering and moving to-
ward the yard where the dogs were
barking and the horses stamping and
neighing

  crossfield-just a moment if you


peoples

dont mind said tennant catching the
older man by the armjrnd drawing him
into a corner of the big room

  crossfield was agitated and nervous
well what is it harry he asked as
he watched the faces of arling and his
wife near the doors opening on the
terrace

  im not asking a casual favor cross-
field said tennant i want you to
do something for me i dont want you
to refuse you know that my horses
arent much good nowadays-ive let
my stable run down im riding my old
hunter muldoon to-day and you know
hes not what he used to be he wouldnt
last through a stiff run

  tennant was talking fast in a
strained whisper and crossfield was lis-
tening mystified vaguely alarmed

  i want a horse right away cross-
field the younger man went on i
want you to sell me featherheels hes
the best horse in the hunt and hell
last i dont know-whats going to
happen crossfield so ill write you my
demand note on a sheet of paper that
will make it safe how much will you
take

  good lord harry what you going
to do gasped the older man dont
go and make a fool of yourself i dont
want to sell featherheels anyway hes
the best horse i ever had i refused

twelve hundred for him and i--

  ill give you fifteen hundred ex-
claimed tennant impatiently ive got
to have the horse crossfield if arling
and-and mrs arling ride into that val-
ley to-day im going too

  i thought so grunted the other

iwhy harry you cant-

  he paused suddenly at the look in
the young mans eyes and caught his
breath sharply perhaps im wrong
harry he said softly perhaps you
can but i dont sell horses under such
circumstances-it would be too much
like trading on human life go out and
take featherheels if you want him

bring him back-if you can my boy

i- oh god help you thats all

  tennant caught his hand and wrung
it passionately then turned without an-
other word and hurried out of the room
crossfield did not follow he gazed
after the gay pink coat and the spotless
buckskin breeches and shining boots
almost choking himself with a sobbing
laugh as he thought of the extravagant
irony of the picture

  he sat down weakly on a chair by
the fireplace and listened to the sounds
that came through the open windows
the people were mounting and the
dogs ardent chorus mounted to a bed-
lam of barks and yelps horses squealed
viciously as they collided and nipped
at each other in the crowded yard and
some of the keen sportsmen cursed
their fractious mounts roundly with-
out regard to the ladies whose own
sporting vocabulary was in some cases
not too formally restrained

  crossfield heard the shrill throaty
voice of arling as he ordered the pro-
fessional huntsman away with the
hounds and cursed him pettishly for
not hunting his own dogs as he had
done in his days as m f h then he
heard the shrill voice raised in fatuous
banter and he liked it no better

  some class to tennant cried ar-
ling as he espied the man named
mounted upon featherheels i dont
blame you harry for chucking your
own skate if you can have that one
but old crossfieldll never let you ride
that horse through purgatory

  crossfield strained his ears for the
answer and barely heard it

  i shall ride wherever you lead ar-
ling tennant replied quietly

  then came a single note on the hunts-
mans horn to announce that the
hounds had taken the scent of the drag
and there were spirited cries of enthusi-
asm and a clatter of eager hoofs as the
hunt went streaming out of the yard
crossfield rose and went to the door
through purgatory



and he saw three belated men still on
foot in the yard tinkering with saddle
gear one of them was young ted
braddock and he was having a prodig-
ious fuss with his stirrup leather
which undoubtedly had been carefully
adjusted by his groom earlier in the
morning his horse was a line chest-
nut gelding one of the best in his fa-
thers stable and the sight of it brought
a sudden impulse to crossfield

  he strode quickly across the yard
took the stirrup leather out of the
youngsters hands with friendly fa-
miliarity rather than rudeness and
hastily measured it for himself on his
extended arm

  ill take your horse if you dont
mind ted he said boldly as he shifted
the buckle tell your father i said
that the country was too sporty for you
in this hunt

  oh i say crossfield exclaimed the
youth indignantly jamming his hands
into his breeches pockets and watching
the commandeering of his mount with
a wry face by jove thats rather too
much you know  you said you werent
going to ride you know now if
youve changed your mind you might
at least take tennants horse

  tennants horse is no good ex-
plained crossfield as though that ended
the matter sorry ted but ive just
decided to ride this will be a hunt
that i wouldnt care to miss hope ill
have a chance to do something for you
some time

  he swung into the saddle leaving the
young man still protesting and rode
out of the yard at a fast gallop the
feeling had come upon him that he must
see who entered upon the projected
dash through the dangerous valley and
he felt an added satisfaction in the
thought that he might be saving captain
braddocks son from a rash adventure
by depriving him of his horse

  the field was at the third fence on
the tomlinson farm when crossfield

overtook it on the fast chestnut and
the hunters cheered him gayly as he
went over the rails after them it was
a fresh breezy morning and the horses
were full of ginger many of them hav-
ing to be held hard on the curb in their
exuberance of spirit

  as crossfield passed the riders that
were holding to the rear he saw ben
arling and his wife riding hard at the
front with harry tennant following
closely peggy arlings big rangy
black frebus was already shining with
nervous sweat and the delicate veins
stood out like cords on his satiny skin
peggy was pulling hard on the curb
and the notoriously vicious horse was
flirting his head and fretting at the re-
straint with constantly increasing anger

  arlings own mount was one of the
best hunters in the field irish bred and
english trained but as mikl-tcmpered
as erebus was vicious and crossfield
was furious when he perceived that
arling was holding steadily about a
length in advance of the black horse
thereby aggravating its ill humor and
making it the harder for his wife to
hold

  some of the women sought the open
gates and the gaps in the hedges but
it was a fast company in general and
the jumps on the tomlinson and drake
places were taken at a steady drive
there were no spills and all but four
members of the field were in joyous
mood ben arling rode with his face
red and set blit with the grin rarely
leaving it his wifes pallor had in-
creased it seemed to crossfield and her
eyes were larger than usual harry
tennant was simply grim  he rode hard
with his eyes to the front never open-
ing his lips or turning his head to reply
to the casual jests that were flung at
him from the rear

  two miles of good country were cov-
ered then before any one seemed to
realize it the last meadow on the drake
place was behind them and the old saw-




peoples

mill could be seen by the roadside a
quarter of a mile away

  the hounds swarmed down the road
and the hunters saw them break and
pause beyond the mill then leaving the
road they disappeared into the verdant
valley below they saw the huntsman
trying to check them but without suc-
cess and then they saw him ride after
his charges into the ravine but at a
cautious pace with his horse held in

  im through for to-day cried mrs
winant pulling up her roan mare no
purgatory sticks and stones for my
pony come back here peggy arling
she added vociferously where are
you going with my thousand dollars on
your precious head

  but peggy arling did not heed the
cry or turn to make any answer she
and her husband with harry tennant
close behind were tearing down the
road at a pace which brought cheers
from some of the men but which meant
to crossfield that erebus could no
longer be held by a womans hands

  there was a hedge at the mouth of
the ravine with a convenient break in
it but none of the three riders stopped
for the break they jumped the hedge
one two three about a length apart
and started on the run through the
course which had been the death of
one of the hunts best riders ten years
before

  five daring hunters followed them
either through recklessness or fear of
ridicule but they rode with tight reins
feeling their way and crossfield told
himself that they would not finish the
run for himself he had no desire to
risk his neck or his borrowed horse so
he left the party in the road without
a word running his horse a furlong
beyond the mill and down a smooth
highway that paralleled the valley he
knew a way that would bring him to
the finish of the run without costing
him more than a hard ride

  peggy arlings face was colorless as

she guided her runaway horse over the
rough turf of the narrow valley toward
the first jump she knew that her hus-
band was now behind her and she could
hear other horses but she did not know
who rode them

  ben arling let his horse out until he
came near her sit tight peg and let
im go he called to her sharply hes
good for the jumps

  she did not turn her head or so much
as nod to show that she heard him and
erebus took off at the three-foot stone
wall with scarcely a break in his wild
pace clearing it as though it were no
more than a hummock on the turf ar-
lings mount ladybird was well in
hand and it took the wall conserva-
tively losing a couple of lengths in
doing it

  tennant came on a close third and
he had a handful in featherheels the
horse had been trained as a steeple-
chase racer and it took off abruptly
with little pause and did not dwell on
the farther side of the juiftp so ten-
nant accustomed to country hunters
found himself pitching in the saddle like
a novice and holding on for his life
he knew however that the horse could
stay-that it would be with him when
he called for action

  they came presently to the first nasty
jump a rail fence with a ten-foot
breadth of brushwood on the near side
erebus checked his mad flight when he
came to it and took the long leap with
an obvious effort there was stubble
on the far side with pebbles and sand
and the black horse floundered an in-
stant snorting angrily as be gathered
himself together and dashed on

  arling went over cautiously picking
his jump and was a dozen lengths be-
hind his wife when he went on feath-
erheels took it like an old racer and was
close to ladybird when he gained the
turf beyond the stubble

  the three now rode for the water
jump a wide deep brook that tumbled

v
through purgatory	

noisily over rocks with a rough hedge
four feet high and as many broad on
the near side of it and with nothing but
muddy gravel at the take-off that
jump it was often said was the be-
ginning of hell beyond it there was
only a half mile more of the valley but
in that stretch were six jumps terminat-
ing at the five-barred gate with the
three-foot drop beyond it-the jump
that had killed tom fielding

  peggys hands no longer tugged at
the reins  she merely held her seat her
hat was off and her long fair hair was
loose and fluttering behind her as the
black horse ran wild his hoofs threw
up the gravel as he struck the take-off
and he slid for a yard but it did not
stop him he rose splendidly over the
hedge clearing the difficult jump like
a bird and ran on beyond the brook
faster wilder than ever

  arling and tennant came close be-
hind they had passed the plodding
huntsman and they could no longer
hear the horses of the other riders
tennant was holding back featherheels
as arling came to the jump first lady-
bird slid into the wet gravel and floun-
dered arling struck her with his crop
anj swore she reared floundered
again and refused

  featherheels took off without a slip
and cleared the hedge and brook pret-
tily then tennant checked him in his
ran and looked back for arling the
latter had not followed tennant looked
anxiously ahead and saw peggy and
the black horse clear the next fence
then he whirled about rode roughly
through the brook and a ragged gap in
the hedge and saw arling walking his
horse slowly toward the bank that led
up to the road above the ravine

  arling called tennant sharply is
your horse hurt 

  no but shes done-she refused
replied the m f h curtly

  tennant touched his horse with the
spur and leaped to arlings side he

caught the mares bridle with his right
hand and pulled her sharply around

  no man or horse will refuse now
arling he cried well finish the run
-you and  

  arling swore and struck him over the
head with his crop tennant took the
blow but he turned ladybirds head
toward the water jump and struck her
furiously across the rump with his own
crop she squealed shrilly and leaped
forward before her rider could check
her she was over the brook and he was
striving desperately to keep his scat

  tennant took the jump again close
behind him and raced even with him
across the marshy turf beyond arling
strove to rein in the mare but tennant
struck her again with his crop

  go on arling he thundered go
on or ill kill you

  the mare was entirely beyond ar-
lings control in spite of his strength
and horsemanship and he fought to
keep his seat just as his wife was light-
ing to keep hers

  tennant pressed hard upon the other
rider at the second jump beyond the
brook and slashed at the mare again as
she took off they went over together
and arling swayed in the saddle catch-
ing at the mares mane to save himself

  arlings mount stumbled and went to
her knees and the man almost fell hut
the merciless tennant threw his horse
back on its haunches to reach back like
a polo player and cut the mare again
with his crop

  ladybird was panic-stricken when
she dashed on and she was breathing
hard from fright and strain the next
fence was no more than three and a half
feet but she topped it with her heels
as she went over and narrowly missed
a crash

  arlings pallor was now more from
fright than anger he had lost his
nerve he was afraid of the horse un-
der him and afraid of the man that
rode relentlessly at his side he could


peoples

not stop his mount in her frantic flight
he could not even fall from the saddle
at such a pace and least of all could
he move a hand to combat his enemy

  with their eyes strained ahead of
them the two men saw the woman and
the black demon rise over the brush
hedge and disappear into the thick
foliage that lay beyond it

  that jump arling gasped ten-
nant breathlessly and then the high
gate well finish together

  they were over the hedge the next in-
stant and arling was like a pale ghost
clinging to the saddle it was a three-
hundred-yard dash to the gate and ten-
nants breath almost stopped as they be-
gan it he did not believe that peggys
horse could make the gate his own
mount was now showing the strain of
the long run andhe expected to makp
one in the fatal crash the ghastly
picture flashed through his mind in one
of the awful remaining seconds three
riders falling at the gate where torn
fielding fell-the spot made tragically
historic for years

  he saw the opening in the tall trees
where the blue sky showed above the
highway that ran past the gate he saw
peggys fair head against the light ris-
ing and falling with the leaps of her
horse tennant was as wild as the
horses now and he looked at the fran-
tic mare beside him with savagely cal-
culating eyes it seemed to him that
her pace was flagging and he raised his
crop and struck her again with all his
strength

  then he saw the gate the girl he
had loved and lost whom he had gone
on loving in his secret heart was dash-
ing toward it and her horse would
never clear it the three-foot drop be-
low it would not be needed to complete
the tragedy

  suddenly the topmost bar of the gate
fell the next one followed it a man
was pulling them off working furi-

ously to tear down the barrier in front
of the charging black runaway

  in another instant but two bars re-
mained and erebus fairly loped across
them gaining the road in safety

  the man at the gate courageously
threw himself upon the last two bars
as the other horses came on tearing
them away from the posts and leaped
for safety arlings mare was almost
upon him as he did so and his leap
added to her terror she shied sharply
to the right and crashed into the stout
post her rider went into the air and
fell in the middle of the macadam road
twenty feet beyond

  featherheels quick of eve and hoof
jumped over the fallen mare and landed
in the road below then heedless of his
rider and still ardent in the chase raced
after the black horse which was dis-
appearing around a turn in the road

  crossfield who had ridden around
the ridge to the south of the valley and
reached the gate in time to tear it down
gazed upon the strange scene for a mo-
ment in a helpless daze then hurry-
ing to the pink-coated form huddled in
the road he knelt beside it

  a few minutes later a horse walked
sedately and a little wearily around
the turn of the road and approached
him tennant was in the saddle and
he held peggy arling limp and sense-
less in his arms

  shes not hurt crossfield he said
simply as he came nearer when i
stopped the black horse she fainted but
i caught her

  crossfield nodded solemnly and got to
his feet

  the horse stopped and tennant
looked down at the still form on the
ground i suppose i have murdered
a man crossfield he said

  the other shook his head slowly i
wouldnt say that he answered
three people rode through purgatory
to-day harry and only two of them
came out
