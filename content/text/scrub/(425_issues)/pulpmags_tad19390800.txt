the roughneck

the night was a brisk one for
a florida beach and steve
colfax was glad he had worn
his topcoat he had supped well at
franchis with the rather boyish sat-
isfaction of knowing that his tuxedo
was worn just as impeccably as that
of any other man in the place it

pleased colfax to put on a little front
once in a while just as mild proof that
a roughneck could still be a gentle-
man and there was an added kick in
knowing that the generous width of
his shoulders was honest muscle not
tailors padding

  he thrust his hands deep in the
pockets of his coat as he swung along
the promenade of curlew beach men-
tally tabulating the fact that franchig

a simple airplane elopement develops

fighting comes natural to this roughneck

  the beach road began to curve here
and he soon found himself alone
which was satisfactory as he liked
isolation it gave him a chance to ex-
pand to push out his elbows to fill his
lungs and think of distant horizons

  the lights of a car swung into
view approaching from the north at
its heels came a second they slid
along like twin pairs of gleaming eyes
strung on a greased wire the rear
car picked up speed flashed even with
the first then crowded it abruptly
against the curb dark figures ap-
peared blending in a haze of swift
movement a womans voice sounded
frightened-indignant

perfectos were worth every cent of
the quarter they cost nothing like
spotless apparel a good meal and a
fragrant cigar to fill a man with a
sense of the well being of life even
if he was a self-styled roughneck

  there were a few other strollers
out besides himself but they were
thinning fast the dance floors and

bright lights of various hotels and re-
sorts were calling

  over on the east the white riders of
the atlantic came rushing in to pound
themselves to foaming fragments on
the dripping sands far out colfax
could see the lights of a steamer beat-
ing south


into a deadly game of financial intrigue

who faces heavy odds with a grin

  colfax did not hesitate he was that
way a roughneck with certain old-
fashioned ideas about women in ten
quick running steps he became one
of the rapidly shufflng figures

  a snarling curse met him and he
ducked just in time to get under a
whistling fist his own aim was bet-
ter and his knuckles bit savagely into
a pallid face the face disappeared
with startling swiftness but another
took its place and colfax swung and
hooked with a sort of ferocious de-
termination returning blows bounced
off his own features and he knew the
taste of his own blood which did not
exactly daunt him he had tasted it
before

  there was a lot of dynamite in

steve colfaxs hundred and seventy
pounds he turned it all loose in that
sudden wild orgy of battle twice he
was battered to his knees but each
time he struggled up to give as good
as he received

 the wail of a siren cut the air
something of numbing heaviness
smacked colfax across the back of the
head he subsided in a dazed stupor
on the running-board of one of the
two machines a motor rumbled gears
clashed ad the other car jerked into

                                movement speeding away up the
                                drive

                                        a motorcycle came snarling up col-
       fax dimly heard the interplay of ex-
       cited voices then the motorcycle

 leap was that oi a beast of prey




thrilling adventures

went yapping off colfax held his
head in his hands trying hard to get a
distant arc light centralized and fo-
cused in the midst of an irritating
pyrotechnic display of flashes of red
green and violent yellow

hands settled upon his shoul-
ders soft firm hands an
equally soft and melodious voice
urged him to move he did so obey-
ing with a docile stumbling clumsi-
ness

  the deep restful cushions of a car
seat enveloped him

  something hard clicked against his
teeth and the tang of good whiskey
drifted under his instantly apprecia-
tive nostrils

  drink commanded the voice

  colfax obeyed and immediately felt
better

  the green and red flares subsided
in their place shone the faint yellow
luminosity of a dashlight

  someone declared colfax ponder-
ously someone hit me

  someone did agreed the voice i
might add that you did a little hit-
ting yourself relax now while i
drive around a bit the night air will
soon clear your head

  the car glided forward in luxuri-
ous smoothness they turned a corner
and picked up speed the crisp air
whistled about his face and things be-
came vastly better he was completely
oriented at last he glanced at his
companion the dashlight etched her
features faintly he got the impres-
sion of a round but determined chin
a soft red mouth and a slightly tip-
tilted nose her eyes were shadowy

  what was it all about he asked

  your guess is as good as mine she
shrugged robbery i suppose-or
worse anyway thanks to you it was
quite a flop of course im ever so
much obliged where did you learn
to fight that way

  im a roughneck he said frankly
fighting comes natural to me where
are you taking me

  home youre rather gory you
know you can clean up a bit and
then ill drive you to your hotel
colfax did not argue his battered
head had begun to throb miserably it
certainly was a flossy roadster he was
riding in

  money here-and class

  the road fled backward a white
winding ribbon they plunged through
a black tunnel of trees spun sharply
to the right and ran up a slightly
sloping driveway

  abruptly the lights of a house burst
upon them

   the roadster slid to a halt the girl
jumped out and ran up some low stone
steps a moment later she returned
with an ebony shiny-eyed servant
george she ordered take this gen-
tleman upstairs and give him access to
hot water hes a friend of mine
george did as he was told ushering
colfax over carpets deep and soft and
rich

  then there was the ivory and silver
of a dazzling bathroom

  here yo are suh said george
make yosef at home suh kin ah
hep yo suh

  colfax grinned painfully a good
tall whiskey would do me a lot of
good george

  georges eyes shone and rolled and
his white teeth gleamed in a stupen-
dous grin yassuh right away suh
colfax now took stock in a huge
mirror he did look a trifle disrep-
utable even for a roughneck his lips
were puffed and his chin a smear of
dried blood there was a decided
mouse under his left eye by turning
sideward and batting his eyes he
could make out a very discernible
bump on the back of his head

  must have tagged me with a black-
jack he muttered as water gushed
into a spotless basin

by the time george returned
colfax had removed all signs of
conflict that were removable his lips
were still puffed however and the
stolen cargo



left eye was darkening steadily the
bump on his head throbbed

  dat musta been quite a ruckus
suh observed george missy elsa
say yoall fit like a whole swarm o
wild cats suh

  colfax drained the glass the servant
had brought then grinned wryly
things did sort of happen for a mo-
ment or two thanks im feeling a
lot better now

  george led the way downstairs the
girl was waiting in the hall for the
first time colfax got a good look at
her

 he found that her eyes were a
deep smoky blue her hair a crown of
sheenful auburn she was slim and
rounded and graceful she smiled
cheerfully

  thats going to be a beautiful black
eye she said critically and your
poor lips-

 with an impulsive unaffected
gesture she laid her fingertips on
them

 colfax grinned down at her
theyre cured now thanks but ive
been enough of a bother to you you
were heading to some engagement i
suppose when that fuss happened
you had better hurry along or youll
be late

  she nodded and reached for her
coat a lustrous furry thing of which
colfax could only guess at the value
he held it for her and found that the
top of her shining head reached just
to his chin

  there was a delicate perfume about
her subtle refined

  once more in the roadster she drove
slowly

  you also were going somewhere
perhaps she asked ill drop you
there if you wish

  he shook his head i was just out
for a little exercise after dinner im
staying at the palms but you neednt
go out of your way just drop me off
anywhere and ill hoof it home

  no ill take you to your hotel
really youre acting unusual or

dont you go much for this hero stuff
thats laying it on chuckled col-
fax im a poor hero im just a
roughneck

  she flashed him a veiled glance as
she tooled the car expertly along

  i fail to see the barnacles was her
crisp retort you keep the rough
edges pretty well covered up

 he subsided it was amazingly
pleasant to glide thus through the
night under the guidance of so charm-
ing a chauffeur after all being a
roughneck was a lonesome job at
times he liked this girl-a lot she
was obviously of a wealthy family and
she possessed a refinement and yet a
total lack of pretence that was agree-
ably genuine

  still at a loss to explain that mix-
up he asked presently

  she shrugged i might have ideas
but they dont matter

the roadster glided to a halt
colfax looked around to see the
modest outlines of his rather obscure
hotel as he started to get out she
laid a hand on his arm her voice was
soft

 seriously im obliged-a lot
youve been-well rather splendid
ive a totally new conception of
roughnecks ill have to cultivate their
acquaintance more

  he smiled that ought to be easy
you can practice on me ive got to
hop down to havana tomorrow but
ill be back the next day how about
day after tomorrow evening will
you be home

 i shouldnt wonder the swift
radiance of her smile made him a trifle
dizzy for a moment her hand lay in
his slim soft and warm until then
-bye

 and it wasnt until she had gone
that steve realized he had not only
forgotten to find out her name but
also he had not given his own

  that was smart he murmured rue-
fully she must think a lot of my
manners


thrilling adventures

chapter ii

duped

early the follow-
ing morning colfax
stood on the landing
stage beside which
his big sikorsky
amphibian plane
was moored his
evening apparel of
the night before was
replaced with khaki and puttees
these were his working clothes he
glanced at his wristwatch five-
twenty his fares were due to arrive
any moment

  a taxi came whirling down the
coral-white roadway above the beach
pulling to a halt opposite the landing
stage a slender dapper rather
swarthy man jumped out and drawing
his light topcoat about him hurried
down to the landing stage

  good morning colfax he greeted
crisply right on time i see well
we got away all right so far lindas
father was just turning in when we
slipped away the party lasted rather
late as i expected he smiled show-
ing even white teeth oh yes he
added at the last moment linda in-
sisted on bringing her maid along no
objections i hope

  none at all mr wolfinger col-
fax said one passenger more or less
cuts no ice plenty of room hope
youve brought along some robes
though well be flying high enough
to get the chill this early in the day
ive got robes nodded wolfinger
but by jove theres something i did
forget we havent had any breakfast
wonder if you could get us a few
sandwiches and a jug of coffee at that
stand up the beach heres five dol-
lars well get aboard while youre
gone

  colfax took the money and hurried
off when he returned the taxi had
left and the passengers were in the
plane the two women muffled to the
eyes in robes wolfinger smoking a

cigarette the man was undeniably

nervous

  colfax grinned wolfinger had a
right to be any one with nerve
enough to elope with the daughter of
j hampstead freeman could not be
blamed for being a little on edge
about it

  the pilot cast off the mooring lines
and stepped aboard the big amphib-
ian rose and fell to the rhythmic
cushioning of the ground swell colfax
eased in before the instruments the
starters growled the props ticked
over and then both of the big motors
rumbled into life he warmed them
carefully his ear cocked to their song
of power

  presently he nodded swung the
plane about and taxied toward the
open sea momentarily the surge of
the water still swayed the ship then
the ship was free and climbing colfax
glanced at wolfinger who grinned
nodded and shook his clasped hands
at least the elopement was off to an
auspicious start

  at eight thousand feet colfax lev-
eled off and set his course he had
tooled his ship to havana several
times before that season carrying
parties of wealthy folk for whom the
gambling parlors and race tracks of
havana held a lure colfax bothered
little about the private business of any
of his fares he was a taxi driver of
the air and as such earned his money
and minded his own business even
though he had often thought that if
many of these various pleasure seek-
ers had less money and more brains
they would be infinitely better off

  far down across the everglade
wastes to the west the gleaming ex-
panse of lake okeechobee lay liquid
silver in the dawning of the new day
to the east the atlantic ran away to
leaden-hued infinity while almost di-
rectly underneath long stretches of
coral reefs and keys were furred with
snowy breaker foam

wolfinger brought him a cup of
coffee and when colfax had downed
stolen cargo



it pointed to the air speed indica-
tor

  can you get a few more miles out
of the ship he asked the quicker
linda and i get to havana the less
chance old man freeman will have of
gumming the works that old devil
wields a lot of power one way and an-
other and the lord only knows what
strings he may try and pull

  colfax nodded and inched the throt-
tles ahead

  you should be there and married
before he even realizes youre gone i
dont see how he can stop you now
he said above the increasing drone of
the motors

  wolfinger smiled tightly maybe
not but im taking nothing for
granted if you knew freeman as well
as i know him youd figure that any-
thing might happen

  wolfinger went back to the women
staring ahead colfaxs brow was
wrinkled his eyes puckered a slight
distaste for this thing came over him
maybe old man freeman was right in
this thing maybe he knew something
about wolfinger that made the latter
very undesirable as a son-in-law

  colfax was old-fashioned enough to
feel that the institution of marriage
was a pretty sacred affair but he also
knew that a lot of social butterflies
did not regard it as such according
to the papers a lot of hasty marriages
among them were followed by equally
hasty divorces he had been hauling
these same society folk hither and
yon in his plane for the past several
seasons and he had never been able to
understand them

  however his plane and himself
were for hire and money seemed no
object to these rich idiots who played
the seasons away along the various re-
sort beaches therefore when wol-
finger had approached him with an
offer of five thousand dollars to trans-
port himself and his run-away bride to
havana colfax was but little sur-
prised

  true the fare was top-heavy but

the chute bloomed above them


thrilling adventures

colfax felt he could not afford to pass
it up after all young folks had been
eloping from the beginning of time
it was none of his business if they
were running away from an irate
parent wolfinger had even presented
linda freeman to him a svelte petite
blonde who was obviously of age and
seemed to know her own mind and
so it had all seemed regular enough
at first

  but now colfax felt there was
something a little off-color about it
he knew that he could not be held to
any accounting by old man freeman
he was just a licensed pilot earning
a fare but- oh well   

  colfax looked down and saw that
they were over the santaren channel
a couple of steamers on the havana-
new york sailing lane were visible
tiny and toylike the fan of their prog-
ress spreading prettily behind them
glancing at the compass he began
banking to the southwest where the
bulk of cuba lay long and dark against
the sea

  and then he stiffened and a ripple
of startled amazement rolled over him
a round hard cold object was jammed
against the back of his neck wol-
fingers voice came sardonic and
mocking

  its really a gun and ill use it in
a hurry if i have to colfax were not
going exactly to havana

  the roughneck twisted his head
slightly and looked up into wolfin-
gers sneering features

  i dont get this he said quietly
and i dont like it i hope you real-
ize what youre doing

  wolfinger laughed his lips drawn
back what i do is no concern of
yours but what you do will be mighty
important to you do as youre told
and youll come out of this in good
shape if you dont-

colfax maneuvered the con-
trols and the big amphibian be-
gan to swing in a wide circle

  were going right back where we

started from he said coolly all
along something told me this was off-
color but that five thousand dollar
fare blinded me i guess my eyes are
open now

  the gun muzzle dug deeper against
his neck

  you havent got long purred wol-
finger put this crate back on the
original course make no mistake
colfax i mean business ive flown
a few land jobs myself and ill take
the chance that i can fly this if i have
to youve got ten seconds to do as
youre told otherwise i finish you
here and now and take over the con-
trols myself

  colfax flashed a glance at the altim-
eter between nine and ten thousand
feet no question wolfinger held the
whip hand he would have plenty of
time to bump his pilot off drag him
clear and take over the ship and
something in the fellows tone told
colfax that he would try exactly what
he said there was absolute ruthless-
ness and conviction in the mans words
and attitude

  colfax saw quickly that getting
killed at this stage of the game would
be idiotic later perhaps-the set-up
might be a little more favorable he
brought the amphibian back on the
original course

  thats better snapped wolfinger
you realize that im not bluffing do
you know where the dog rocks are
colfax nodded silently

  good so do i head for them
colfax unrolled a tiny map made a
few mental calculations then changed
the course a trifle

  i hope he said grimly the time
comes when i can get a clear swing at
you wolfinger so help me youll
wish youd never tried this on me
what kind of crookedness are you
up to

  wolfinger cursed shut up youll
talk yourself into a quick grave if you
arent careful gun a few more revs
out of those motors

  at near maximum speed the am-
stolen cargo



phibian thundered along boring al-
most due south dog rocks rose out
of the sea ahead rugged foam-washed
beyond showed the bulk of damas
keys between them lay a small
angle-shaped key plastered green
with tropical foliage

  thats our destination rasped
wolfinger pointing with his free
hand down we go land in that lit-
tle bay in the angle and remember-
no tricks

  colfax put the nose over and throt-
tled down elevation fell away and
soon the sikorsky was whistling
along scarcely two hundred feet above
the water for a moment colfax con-
sidered the idea of calling wolfingers
hand again and turning back wol-
finger would not dare to shoot now
for the ship would certainly crash if
he did he would not have time to
get at the controls and avert it

  but colfax put the thought aside
if the ship did go into the water there
were two women who would have to
pay and the idea of them being caught
like rats in a trap was not appealing
also the big ship represented a small
fortune in itself every cent colfax
had in the world was tied up in it on
top of that he wasnt an old man him-
self-and life was sweet

obviously he had let himself
in for something this thing was
crooked somewhere but the damage
was done now he saw that the sen-
sible thing to do was to play the string
out and watch who he hired out to in
the future so he crossed the key to
the lee side banked into the wind and
dipped down to the water for a mo-
ment his eyes were busy with the
landing but as soon as the ship was
safely bobbing on the sea he looked
around

  the island seemed completely bul-
warked with sharp sea-worn rocks
while beyond this protecting barrier
low dense vegetation gleamed in the
sun wolfinger pointed to where the
spine of rocks curved inward

  taxi up he ordered curtly

  colfax edged the plane toward the
point indicated and as they came
abreast of it he saw that it was an in-
let ending in a tiny bay hardly more
than a hundred yards across a rickety
jetty stuck out into the bay and tied
beside it was a long powerful sea-
going launch beyond jutting from
the trees was the corner of a palm-
thatched hut with a wireless aerial
reaching above it

  two men were visible on the deck
of the launch and as the plane surged
slowly in motors drumming as col-
fax jazzed and cut them three others
appeared under wolfingers direc-
tions the tricked pilot laid the
sikorsky beside the launch and cut
the ignition then he turned to find
wolfinger waiting gun trained stead-
ily at him

  just hold it ordered wolfinger
youll be taken care of in a minute
or so

  colfax said nothing lighting a ciga-
rette two of the men pushed a dinghy
from the launch and put mooring
lines on the plane then they sculled
the little boat to the cabin door which
wolfinger opened

  okay boys he greeted we got
her he turned to the petite blonde
whom he had introduced to colfax on
their first meeting as linda freeman
out you go kid

  the blonde gave colfax an amused
glance as she passed him and climbed
down into the dinghy wolfinger
called one of the men in a huge black
haitian negro he nodded toward the
other woman the one he had repre-
sented as the blondes maid she still
sat erect and stiff still swathed to the
eyes in robes

  as the negro stepped over to her
and loosened the rugs colfax saw
something that made his eyes start and
sent the surging crimson of fury
through his veins that slim figure
was tightly bound and gagged with a
strip of adhesive tape across her
mouth as the amazed pilot looked he


thrilling adventures

met a pair of terrified eyes eyes of an
intense smoky blue a knitted toque
fell aside to disclose a crown of shin-
ing auburn hair

  something clicked in colfaxs brain
recognition battered for utterance
he had seen such eyes and hair some-
where before last night great god
that was it-this was the girl of last
night

fior a moment he was too dazed
and stunned to move the negro
lifted the slim figure in his gorilla
arms he passed close to colfax with
his burden and those blue eyes sought
those of the self-styled roughneck
again full of a tragic plea he didnt
know what it was all about but he
knew that he had to rescue this girl
again

  a wild red haze flooded his brain
he took a long deliberate drag on his
cigarette then flipped it straight into
wolfingers face and with the same
move he launched himself forward in
a low hard dive

  wolfingers gun roared and glass
tinkled as the slug tore through a
cabin window and plowed into the
water colfax knew a savage joy as
his hunched shoulders slugged against
wolfingers knees cutting the fellows
feet cleanly from under him and
bringing him down with a crash

  almost as wolfinger hit the floor
of the cabin colfax was scrambling
over him to get the gun wolfinger
lunged up snarling like a wild cat
colfax smashed him in the face with a
short hook and wolfinger went limp
the victor knew a surge of satisfac-
tion as his hand closed on the gun he
would cut the odds down now

  he heard a muttered feral sort of
noise and turned to see the big negro
clambering back into the cabin he
twisted flipping up the gun as he did
so he saw the negro make a throw-
ing motion toward him there was a
flicker of naked steel in the air and it
seemed that a red-hot iron had been
drawn across his gun hand instinc-

tively he flinched and his shot went
wild before he could shoot again the
negro was upon him in a headlong
leap that had the impact of a batter-
ing ram

  the big black was muscled like a
tiger and his steely grip twisted the
gun free twice he slammed it at col-
faxs head the second blow landed
and it seemed to the white as if he had
been tossed into the heart of a great
roaring yellow flame where he hov-
ered for a moment before dropping
far down into darkness and silence

chapter iii

death sentence

a sort of accumu-
lated punishment of
scorching thirst and
fiendishly throbbing
head brought steve
colfax back to con-
sciousness it re-
quired distinct ef-
fort to open his aching and blood shot
eyes

  he stared up at a thatched roof
walking along it upside down was a
big blue lizard colfax watched the
reptile soddenly while he tried to col-
lect his thoughts where the dickens
was he anyway he tried to lift a
hand to his head and found that his
hands and arms would not function
he realized then that he was bound
hand and foot and of a sudden he
remembered everything

  he closed his eyes again as his mind
went over the startling events of the
past sixteen or eighteen hours method-
ically he laid the events in a line and
in their proper sequence

  first wolfinger had approached
him with the story of the intended
elopement and his proposition of hir-
ing the services of the free-lance pilot
and his plane then there was that
ruckus along the promenade at curlew
beach that had brought about his
meeting with the girl of the smoky
blue eyes and he knew now that this
stolen cargo



whole thing was a kidnaping it was
quite plain in view of subsequent
events

  unconsciously he had frustrated the
first attempt and just as ignorantly
he had aided in the final success of the
thing he groaned slightly what an
ass a man could be when his eyes were
blinded by money

 sure it was a kidnaping that
blonde whom wolfinger had intro-
duced as linda freeman was no more
the genuine article than colfax was a
chinaman she was part of the front
-part of the scheme and how easily
he had fallen for the maid story he
had even fallen for the dodge of going
for coffee and sandwiches so wol-
finger and the taxi-driver could carry
the pseudo maid into the ship where
bound and gagged and shrouded with
robes she had been unable to warn
colfax of what was going on oh yes
indeed-mister steve colfax had been
a sucker of the first fish

  it was characteristic of colfax how-
ever that he did not call the game fin-
ished here the string wasnt played
out yet he began to work method-
ically at his bonds it seemed a hope-
less struggle for a long time he made
no progress whatever those tightly
drawn ropes resisted every effort and
his right hand where the negros
thrown knife had struck smarted and
ached

  from time to time he relaxed then
renewed his efforts gradually it
seemed he gained a little realiza-
tion of this spurred him to more furi-
ous efforts he rolled from side to
side on the earthen floor panting and
straining sweat gathered on his face
and streamed into his eyes and the
blue lizard on the thatch ceiling
watched him in wonderment

  he rested again his wrists on fire
the exertion had set his heart to
pounding and his damaged head suf-
fered in proportion once or twice he
gave way to a volley of cursing but
the knots held he relaxed helplessly
and then he noticed that the stricture

of his wrists seemed slightly lessened
he tried once more but left his mus-
cles flat and soft instead of swelling
them in effort and now he found that
in this manner he could slide his right
hand an inch or two up and down

  abruptly he quieted voices sounded
outside the hut along with the muf-
fled thump of approaching footsteps
he lay back with closed eyes he be-
gan moaning slightly as though just
recovering consciousness

someone fumbled at the door
then swung it back wolfinger
came in followed by the big negro
and another white man a burly heavy-
shouldered hard-faced individual
who had the breath of the sea breezing
out all over him wolfinger carried
his automatic and held it ready for
use

  colfax moaned again and rolled his
head slightly

  water he muttered water

  wolfinger laughed harshly he
seems to be coming back i thought
for a while jase youd swung a little
too hard with that clout you gave him
let him have that water

  the negro padded out to soon re-
turn with an earthen jug he lifted
the prisoners head with one hand and
held the jug to his lips with the other
colfax drank with real appreciation
thirst had been torturing him

  then he cunningly simulated re-
turning consciousness he opened his
eyes in a vague puzzled manner he
saw wolfinger bending over him

  know what happened and where
you are demanded wolfinger

  colfax stared let his eyes clear
slightly then nodded its coming
back to me-now he muttered

  youre lucky an ounce more on
that wallop by jase and youd have
been through for good youve been
out several hours colfax and after i
warned you too

  how long were you out blurted
colfax

  long enough to take a good count


thrilling adventures

admitted wolfinger red lights flick-
ering in his dark eyes i owe you one
for that and i generally pay my
debts-especially that kind

  what are you going to do with
me colfax demanded bluntly indif-
ferent to the implied threat

  weve been talking that over cap-
tain stover and i we cant seem to
agree can you suggest anything
nothing except that youd better
go slow it happens that ive a few
friends back in the states if i dont
show up there will be inquiries
wolfinger laughed sardonically
there have been so many fliers who
start out over water and dont come
back these days your disappearance
wont call for a great deal of excite-
ment missing airmen have become a
drug on the market pal think of
something else

  the man designated as captain sto-
ver had been looking the prisoner
over carefully

  my first suggestion is the best one
wolfinger he bit out with sudden
harshness the quicker the sharks
get hold of this fellow the better for
all concerned now that we cant get
word through nassau we dont know
what might happen and hes too dan-
gerous to keep hanging around you
dont dare let him go knowing what
he does and we cant afford to have
him on our hands too long

  despite himself a shiver went up
and down colfaxs spine sharks
there were plenty of the brutes in
these southern waters wolfinger
seemed to sense his thoughts and he
smiled a cold slightly gloating smile

  im thinking of that strongly he
nodded

  colfax met wolfingers eyes what
are you going to do with that girl you
packed off wolfinger he asked
kidnaping is a pretty stiff offense
you know and by the way what is
your real name all crooks have
aliases i understand

  this got a rise out of wolfinger
his eyes burned red again

  you fool he burst out if you
had minded your own business and
played sensible from the start of this
thing id have given you a break but
stover is right you know too much
and youre one of those birds who
shoot off their mouth if they get the
chance so the sharks will feed jase
as soon as it gets dark take him out
to the rocks and do the job this is
no time for squeamishness make it
sure jase

the negros eyes rolled and his
teeth flashed as he grinned ac-
knowledgment of the order they
went out and barred the door colfax
waited only until the sound of foot-
steps died away before he was work-
ing feverishly at his bonds he had
until dark which by the rapidly fad-
ing dusk could not have been more
than half an hour away sharks was
it his face set in rugged lines did
wolfinger think he had a soft playboy
or squeamish pacifist to contend with

  back and forth he slid his right
hand in the slight slack he had orig-
inally gained bit by bit he worked
the rope down his right wrist until it
brought up against his slashed
knuckles he could feel the warm
stickiness of renewed bleeding coat-
ing his hands but he only gritted his
teeth as he dragged the open wound
against the rope twisting the hand
from side to side

  the maneuver cost him plenty in
pure unadulterated pain but the
agony of desperation overrode that of
the physical the harsh roughened
hemp gouged deep but did not deter
him a final painful jerk and his hand
slid free

  for a moment he lay quiet resting
and sucking at his raw bleeding wrist
and knuckles then he freed his
ankles and struggled to his feet while
the circulation was returning he ex-
amined his prison the hut was not
over ten feet square built of logs
driven upright into the earth with
cracks between them that admitted
stolen cargo



light and air he tried the door cau-
tiously but could not budge it that
thatched roof was his only hope

  there were cross braces on the door
and by pulling himself up on these
colfax found he could reach the roof
he began tearing at the thatch it was
a fight against time and time was
short

  the material of the thatch smelled
musty swarms of spiders and other
queer looking bugs showed up as he
dug deeper and deeper tearing out
handful after handful of the stuff
abruptly his hand went through into
the open

  he worked feverishly as the hole
enlarged he could see how dusky it
was getting outside he pulled him-
self up higher forgetting his tortured
and aching muscles and equally thun-
dering head the hole widened he
got his head through then his shoul-
ders a last lift and he was com-
pletely through

  for a moment he lay flat on the low
slope of the roof getting back his
breath and strength below him he
could see a trail winding out toward
the open sea and that first hut beside
the jetty

  colfax slid to the earth and tried to
plan a definite and sensible course of
action with only himself to consider
he might have made a break for the
depths of the jungle and taken his
chances on hiding out until an oppor-
tunity of escape offered but there was
the girl to think of and somehow he
felt a moral responsibility for her pre-
dicament and her safety hed see her
through or go down fighting he knew
what his own end was to be if he were
captured again but that was a chance
he had to take

as he stood there his problem
literally jumped up and hit him
in the face he glimpsed a huge figure
come swinging down the trail through
the murk it was jase the negro come
to execute him

  colfax slipped softly from sight

around the angle of the hut jase
would be armed without doubt either
with knife or gun while colfax had
nothing but his bare fists plus the hot
and surging anger that had been build-
ing up in him steadily since regain-
ing consciousness

  at first colfax considered letting
the negro enter the hut then slam-
ming the door and barring it but he
realized immediately that this would
not do jase was sure to set up a roar
that would arouse the entire island
there remained only the desperate ex-
pedient of getting the giant black
brute man to man and silencing him
colfaxs only chance for the future
lay in stealth and undiscovered free-
dom now

  he watched the negro come on and
halt at the door jase jerked loose the
bars swung back the door and ducked
his head to enter as he did so colfax
saw the pale gleam of a naked dirk in
the blacks huge paw sight of that
bared steel set queer feral fires flam-
ing in the erstwhile prisoner ruth-
lessness incarnate was in that black
prowling form colfax slid up to the
side of the door and crouched there
drawing his feet well beneath him
tensing his arm and shoulder for a
supreme effort

  there came a guttural exclamation
of surprise and alarm and the negro
lumbered out bewildered and con-
fused at the disappearance of the pris-
oner colfax marked the side of the
black neck and swung putting every
ounce of power he had into the punch
he aimed for just below the ear and
his fist thocked home to that exact
spot

  the negros knees caved and with
a kind of instinctive sideward twist
he went down falling away from the
blow colfax caught another gleam of
that bared knife and he dived forward
on top of the fellow grabbing for the
steel but jase pulled his arm be-
neath him as he fell and colfaxs grab
at the weapon failed

  he immediately switched his tac-

tics aiming another punch at the bul-
let head before it could land the
black gave a long gurgling sigh
shuddered then collapsed his body
strangely shrunken his muscles limp
colfax knew that his first punch had
been a wicked one yet the negro was
so huge so uncouthly powerful it did
not seem possible that any single blow
could have put him out cold but cold
he was so colfax rolled him over
and then he understood jase had
fallen on the naked knife and was
stabbed to the heart

chapter iv

desperate tactics

colfax was a lit-
tle stunned but he
wasted no time in
regrets this was a
desperate game
that knife had been
meant for him ruth-
lessness begets ruth-
lessness and colfax
made the most of this break of luck

  he knew he had to get rid of the
negro somehow so he swung the limp
figure over his shoulder and stalked
off into the night he knew also that
when jase failed to return wolfinger
would become alarmed and start a
search the body had to be disposed
of-and quickly

  with the pound of the surf to guide
him colfax pushed through a strip of
jungle and came out on a narrow ex-
panse of spray-swept beach beyond
which the breakers tossed and heaved
and roared against the protecting
rock rim above a swirling foam-
creamed pocket in the rocks colfax
stopped and lowered his limp burden
his eyes were hard and his lips a nar-
row grim line as he recovered the knife
and wiped it clean on the negros
singlet then with a push he con-
signed the body to the waves

  by this time he had pretty well lo-
cated himself so he cut back at an
angle toward the little bay where the

launch and plane had been left he
soon came upon it and from the shel-
ter of the undergrowth studied the
layout both launch and plane were
still there rising and falling lazily to
the swell that came in from the outer
sea

  there were lights on the launch and
he could make out the dim figure of a
man on deck he saw no other signs
of life a slender sickle of a moon
gleamed in the western sky throwing
a pale eerie light that seemed to
deepen rather than penetrate the shad-
ows

  obviously the first consideration
was to locate the girl his mind was
definitely made up on that score the
problem of ultimate and complete es-
cape loomed as a staggering task but
he felt honor bound to do his best by
her

  there were just two places she
could be-either on the launch or in
the hut that showed from the bay he
decided to have a look at the hut first
keeping just within the shelter of the
jungle he made his way around the
curve of the bay

  presently colfax spied the pale yel-
low radiance of a light framed in a
small window very stealthily he
moved forward every sense alert the
wall of the hut loomed up throwing a
deep shadow into which he crept

 he edged up to the window and
caught the drone of voices listening
intently he identified those of wol-
finger and stover presently he heard
the blonde whose presence in the
scheme of things he had almost for-
gotten

  straightening up he found that he
had a good view of the interior of the
hut seated around a crude table were
wolfinger stover and the blonde a
couple of half-used candles stuck in
the necks of bottles gave the only
light the three were arguing fitfully
and something in their expression
showed that a back-fire in their
scheme had occurred

  stover alone seemed stolid and un-
stolen cargo



concerned wolfingers dark eyes
were gleaming hotly and his swarthy
features pulled into a scowl the
blonde was plainly frightened or at
least very nervous for her face was
wan and pale in the guttering light
stover was speaking in a growl

  no use getting all upset byers
will have something through to us
pretty quick were safe enough here
dog rocks are off the main sailing
lanes they would never think of
looking here for us if they should
we can make a run for it in either the
plane or launch and he added a
wicked leer gleaming in his deep-set
murky eyes we can always get rid
of the evidence if necessary eh
maude

  colfax distinctly saw the blonde
shiver and the look she turned on
stover was one of loathing as for
wolfinger he shook his head sharply

  nothing like that stover i renege
when it comes to murder

  stover laughed nastily since
when he sneered you just sent
jase to slit the throat of that aviator
youre getting damned virtuous all of
a sudden no use pulling that line on
maude findlay and me

  the flyer was a different proposi-
tion wolfinger said coldly he
wont be missed particularly but
any time you talk of doing away with
the main stockholder in a twenty-
million-dollar corporation youre
crazy elsa sparling is somebody
back in the states

  colfax went cold all over elsa
sparling he remembered how the
negro servant george had called her
missy elsa elsa sparling he was
astounded this girl whom chance had
thrown him in contact with twenty-
four hours previous and the one he
had unwittingly helped to kidnap was
elsa sparling the papers had been
full of elsa sparling not so very long
ago when on the death of her father
she had advanced to the control of the
sparling oil company

  big money was behind this whole

thing wolfinger was a cold-blooded
individual but hardly a complete fool
he was gambling now but for mighty
stakes apparently this information
made him doubly dangerous and reck-
less

  k amn it went on wolfinger
mw  wish i knew what had gone
wrong i wish id sent byers down
with the girl and stayed to supervise
things there myself i dont see what
can be holding him up the directors
meeting was to be held in new york
at eleven today old man ransomewas
ready to vote the girls proxy on the
right side byers was to be right with
him all the time to make sure he didnt
change his mind

  maybe they found out that the
girls proxy was a forgery suggested
the blonde

  ive thought of that nodded wol-
finger sourly but it is hardly pos-
sible it was too well done

  if thats the case why worry
yawned stover well get word be-
fore long

  but were losing time growled
wolfinger and we cant afford that
if everything had gone off without a
hitch wed have the girl back on the
mainland by this time shed have put
up a roar of course but it wouldnt
do her much good theres been too
many men gunning for the sparling
interests-men with money and legal
backing old john sparling used to
lick em at every turn of the road and
they havent forgotten

  as for the press and public theyd
laugh off her story a lot of celebri-
ties have put up a kidnaping yarn to
cover some little personal escapade
yet if we keep her here any length
of time the case becomes self-evident
well be in for trouble-lots of it
oh i dont know grinned stover
the man seemed hard as nails were
not so awful far from south america
and if we have to make a run for it
we can hole up there somewhere and
thumb our nose at uncle sam


thrilling adventures

  wolfinger looked at him pityingly
extradition has a long arm in this
day and age and dont you fool
yourself were in this thing up to
our necks what with running off
with elsa sparling and bumping off
that fool aviator and-by the way
jase ought to be back by this time
he frowned wonder whats keeping
him better go and see stover
from his position at the window
colfax had been taking stock of the
hut there were evidently two rooms
to the place with the plotters in the
front one a barred door showed at
the inner wall and colfax felt cer-
tain that behind that door was elsa
sparling

  stover with a grunt of assent to
wolfingers suggestion got to his
feet but just at this moment there
came the sound of running feet off to
the right colfax flattened in the
shadows as one of the crew of the
launch came panting up the fellow
went into the hut a tall stooped
cadaverous sort in singlet and dun-
garees

  wolfinger looked up eagerly any
word saunders

  saunders shook his head nothing
except that one of the boys picked up
the drone of an airplane motor just
now it seems to be coming closer all
the time

  wolfinger lunged to his feet his
features desperate and hunted sto-
ver phlegmatic as usual seemed un-
affected by the news but the blonde
turned pale as a ghost and began to
whimper lacking her usual set smile
she looked old and worn

  if that plane comes in here it
means one of two things snapped
wolfinger either someone has
squealed and a patrol is out after us
or byers is sending in some message
from nassau that he couldnt get out
over the air lets hope to god its the
last come on stover-weve got to
see about this

  as he and stover started for the
door the blonde got to her feet

  dont-dont leave me here alone
she whimpered

  shut up wolfinger rasped and
quit that everlasting whining maude
you stay here if anything happens
yell

  the three men disappeared at a run
and the blonde dabbing at her eyes
with a crumpled wad of linen began
pacing the floor nervously

  colfaxs mind was racing now if
ever was his chance to free elsa spar-
ling the whole of a long dark night
lay ahead and once he got her back
in the jungle-covered interior of the
island they could at least remain hid-
den until daylight and by that time
much might happen

  colfax felt he had a pretty good
idea of the temper of this gang now
for all wolfingers flat refusal of
stovers evil suggestion concerning
elsa sparling colfax knew that the
man if cornered would prove as ruth-
less to the girl as a striking snake
where his own absolute safety was
concerned he would do away with all
living evidence without the slightest
compunction the future was indeed
a desperate one

  colfax edged around to the door of
the hut now he also caught the hum
of the motor of that approaching
plane it rose and fell in intensity
ululating before the fitful pressure of
the wind his ears trained for years
to the song of a motor told him it was
coming directly toward the island-
and coming fast it would serve to
keep wolfinger and the rest occupied
for a few minutes at least

colfax waited no longer bran-
dishing the knife he had taken
from jase the negro he leaped into
the room at the moment he was a
mighty tough customer he was
tousled and disheveled his clothes
torn and stained with the blood of the
dead man he had carried to the sea
most potent of all was that gleaming
blade he flourished

  maude findlay seemed literally pet-
stolen cargo



rifled as he sprang toward her it was
something of a play on colfaxs part
he didnt intend to hurt this pallid
thing but he knew that if necessary
to keep her quiet he would use her
somewhat roughly luckily he didnt
even have to touch her

  her mouth opened as though to
scream but she did not make a sound
instead she caught her hands at her
throat took a backward step then slid
to the floor her eyelids fluttering she
had fainted dead away

  colfax never gave her a second
glance he leaped to the inner door
wrenching the bars aside the room
beyond was black dark

  miss sparling he called softly
elsa sparling-where are you

  something seemed to scuffle slightly
something which thumped on the
floor he felt his way across the room
soon he found her and when he did
so his throat tightened and a red mist
swam before his eyes she was still
trussed up like a mummy he un-
gagged her first then cut loose her
hands and feet

 can you walk he murmured
solicitously

  she tried to get erect but couldnt
make it her limbs were numb from
the stricture of the bonds she gave a
hopeless little moan without further
hesitation colfax caught her in his
arms and turned to leave but just be-
fore he reached the door it closed with
a crash plunging him into stygian
blackness

  surprise froze him for a moment
then because he was playing a des-
perate game to a final showdown and
because a red fighting fury had built
up in him he drove forward against
the door his left shoulder hunched
low for the shock and every ounce of
weight and power in him put to the
effort

  there was a splintering sound and
the door crashed open again the
blonde who had come out of her faint
had been in the act of dropping the
first bar into place again the impact

of colfaxs berserk charge smashed
the door against her flinging her
headlong across the room where she
brought up with a thump against the
far wall colfax saw her head bang
heavily and she slid down in a limp
heap he knew she was out this time
for a long count

  in the yellow light of the candles
he flashed a look down at the face of
elsa sparling where it cradled
against his shoulder it was white and
wan and those great smoky blue eyes
were filled with the tragedy of pain
and fright but as she caught his
glance she smiled

 knew-youd come she whis-
pered im not afraid-now

  something caught at colfaxs throat
and his eyelids stung his grasp
around her tightened then he was
out into the night and the tangle of
the jungle had enveloped them

chapter v

dirty business

steve colfax
carried elsa spar-
ling a long way
south into the island
before he set her
down in a small
opening in the un-
dergrowth it was
dark there though
not to that inky consistency where
everything is subdued and hidden
completely the combined light of
the stars and the far sunken moon fil-
tered down aiding but not disclos-
ing

  so far aside from those first whis-
pered words neither of them had
spoken but now colfax got down on
his knees beside her and taking one
of her wrists in his hands began rub-
bing it gently to restore circulation
again

  is there any strength in it at all
he asked gruffly

full of needles-and so are my


thrilling adventures

ankles she replied do you think-
those men will find us

  not for a while he said sturdily
not before daylight at least and by
that time a lot of things can happen
we wont go down without a good
fight i got you into this and ill get
you out-somehow

 a shadowy smile twitched at her
lips still a pretty capable rough-
neck arent you but dont blame
yourself in any way for this ive
heard enough talk to know how they
tricked you it isnt your fault

  ill always feel it is lord-how
dumb a man can be sometimes when
his eyes are blinded by gold

 i-i was horribly frightened-
once her voice shook and thickened
a trifle that was when i heard
wolfinger tell that negro to go and
finish you off but somehow-some-
thing told me-youd beat them at
their own game what-what became
of the negro

 he went to the same fate they
picked for me he wont come back
colfax answered tersely

 he switched his rubbing to her
slender ankles she watched him with
inscrutable eyes her lips tightening
at the exquisite torture of returning
circulation

  mind telling me something of what
is behind all this he asked

  an attempt at one of those pieces
of business brigandage that slick
lawyers manage to justify so often
she obliged but it wont work this
time they need my vote at the direc-
tors board theyve been after me for
months trying to influence me ive
objected flatly and theyve grown
desperate it seems

 i heard some talk of a forged
proxy said colfax

  she nodded i anticipated a move
of that sort quite a while ago ive
taken care of that my real proxy is
in the hands of a man i know i can
trust at the proper time hell use it
theyll all be hung in their own
crooked ropes

  that mixup on the drive at curlew
beach had something to do with this
i suppose

  yes it was their second attempt
at getting me out of the way long
enough to do their crooked manipula-
tion this is the third and successful
one to their way of thinking but
they are doomed to failure

  how did they get hold of you

lsa told him fully

 you recall i told you of a
party i had to attend when i came to
leave my car would not start they
had tinkered with it somehow i ex-
pect i had a taxi called which was
stepping right into their trap at one
place on the road home the taxi
slowed down suddenly and two men
leaped in one from either side

  i could do nothing they tied me
up and gagged me and the taxi drove
out to a lonely spot and stopped there
until early morning just before day-
light wolfinger came along his real
name by the way is really frank an-
drews former secretary of my father
dad discharged him some three
months before his death for crooked-
ness anyway wolfinger whom you
know and that blonde woman whom i
never saw before came to the taxi and
took charge

 they wrapped me up in robes so
on careless scrutiny i did not appear
to be a prisoner then they had the
taxi driven down to your plane i
heard them discussing the ruse they
would use to move you out of the way
long enough to get me into the plane
passing me off as the blondes maid
they hit upon the idea of sending
you for some coffee

  i fell for the whole thing like a
fool growled colfax in disgust id
qualify for a booth in a nut factory
one thousand percent better try and
walk around a little theyll discover
your disappearance any minute now
and we may have to do a lot of run-
ning and dodging

  in that tiny cathedral of the jungle
stolen cargo



elsa sparling started pacing to and
fro

  at first her movements were just
a painful wobble her rescuer had to
walk with her supporting her with
one arm about her shoulders he
knew that she was suffering for sev-
eral times she caught her breath in a
little gasp but she was a spartan
and kept on moving after a time she
grew stronger and pulled quietly
away from him going about her exer-
cising alone

  it was about then that colfax heard
what he had been listening for

  a long wailing shout of alarm
echoed down the wind there was a
raging threat in it somehow the girl
heard that yell and instinctively she
came close to colfax her face white
in the furtive light of the stars

  i-heard wolves howl one time-
when i was up in canada on a fishing
trip with my father she said un-
steadily that reminds me of the
wolf cry this is desperate steve
colfax

  he nodded no use trying to kid
ourselves were up against it-bad
in the light of what youve told me i
can guess the news that plane brought
to wolfinger they know the game
is up and they know theyve got to si-
lence both of us yes were up against
a tough proposition but and here
his jaw set grimly were a long way
from being licked

  isnt there some place we can hide
-some place where they cannot reach
us surely in this jungle-

  not a place-after daylight comes
colfax answered honestly until day-
light we can elude them after that
it is only a matter of time but ive
been thinking theres a chance for
us if we can get back to the sikorsky
of course theyll have someone
guarding it but ill take care of one
guard-or two for that matter if i
get half a chance if we can make the
plane we stand a chance at escape
although it will be a long gamble

  alone id try it without hesita-

tion but i hate to think of asking
you to share the risk there is a
chance of outside help showing by
daylight your disappearance must
have been noted at home a search is
sure to be going on but whether it
will reach this far south-in time-
is problematical and unless it does
reach here by daylight-well i dont
like to think just what the finish may
be

she caught his arm strongly
fiercely then well try for the
plane well try for the plane steve
colfax

 he looked down at her his heart
surging youre a thoroughbred
elsa sparling come on

 hand in hand they stole through
the murk of the jungle guiding their
steps by the pound of the breakers
the girl was still dressed in the eve-
ning gown she had worn to the party
but it was sadly bedraggled torn and
soiled by this time yet it was a sub-
dued shade and blended as well to the
dark as did colfaxs disheveled serv-
ice-worn khaki

 presently the narrow beach lay
ahead colfax took a swift survey up
and down it then led the way across
until they were crouched below the
rock rim hearing no sound of out-
cry he began working stealthily
north

  it was nerve-racking business his
eyes ached with the strain of trying
to pierce the gloom of the night the
wind driving in from the sea was not
particularly cold but it picked the
spume tips from the breakers and
drove the wetness about them in thick
clouds of spray

 they were soon drenched to the
skin but the excitement and nervous
tension kept them from even thinking
of chill

 abruptly something moved in the
night ahead a hunched gangling form
picking a way along the edge of the
rocks into a tiny black crevice col-
fax pulled his companion his hand


thrilling adventures

on her shoulder forcing her to crouch
low

  beside her he poised motionless
staring

  the dark figure came closer it was
a seaman carrying a long object on
which the starlight glinted faintly a
rifle very softly grimly colfax
drew his knife from his belt he
didnt relish the thought of using cold
steel on one of his own kind but so
desperate was their position he was
thankful for possession of any
weapon

  discovery was certain the man
was currying the rocks thoroughly
colfax bent his head until his lips
were close to elsa sparlings ear and
the faint perfume of her hair was in
his nostrils

  no matter what happens dont
scream he breathed and if i lose
run for the jungle and i mean run
quiet now

  her reply was to him an amazing
thing she turned her head suddenly
upward

  her lips moist and warm and sweet
pressed his

  a great livid flame surged through
steve colfax his blood was fired by
it

  a ripple of steely resolve swelled
and towered inhim he gathered his
feet beneath him and waited

the searcher was close just be-
yond the corner of the rock behind
which they crouched then he ap-
peared looking straight down into
colfaxs set face and gleaming eyes
and in that fractional second the
aviator recognized him

  it was the nondescript and ugly
saunders

  saunders threw back his head his
mouth opening for a shout of alarm
at the same time he swung his rifle
toward them

  colfaxs leap was that of a pounc-
ing beast of prey he drove his lean
long body out and upward the bared
knife whistling with the stroke for

one awful second saunders eyes were
wide and staring

  then the knife thocked home in his
throat cutting off life and sound at
the same moment

  colfax was sick and nauseated as
he floundered off along the drenched
sand and the girl who clung to
his arm was sobbing but the knowl-
edge that what he had done had
been stark necessity kept them both
from a kind of insane revulsion

  dirty business he choked dirty
business j

  across the narrow stretch of the
bay loomed the bulk of the sikorsky
plane and beyond it the launch also
pulled well up at the very head oe
the bay was the other plane a small
and speedy biplane equipped with
floats

  colfax crouched low studying the
layout the plan he had formulated
was daring and mad enough but he
was going to gamble that the very
audacity of it would make it success-
ful it was hardly probable that wol-
finger would expect him to try for a
getaway in his own ship and under
their very noses which was why col-
fax intended to try it yet such a
little thing could upset the whole
scheme that even now steve was very
doubtful of success desperate as it
was however it was the only feasible
course

  elsa sparling crouched beside him
saying nothing her sobs over that
ghastly business along the beach had
ceased now

  she was putting full trust in his
judgment

  he turned to her you can swim

  she nodded

  very well we head straight for
the sikorsky you know what silence
means when we reach the plane ill
help you through a cabin window on
this side i dont think any one will
be in it then ill circle it and cut the
mooring ropes once away in the
ship they can whistle for us and well
take a long time answering

flight

unlacing his

puttees colfax then
took off his shoes
he wanted to con-
serve every ounce of
energy possible he
could only guess
what they might
bump into at the
launch and it took energy to fight
with

  elsa sparling did not hesitate she
kicked off her battered pumps made
a few quick passes with her hands
and stepped out of her dress to stand
slim and straight in silken under-
things colfax made another mental
credit in her favor no damn false
prudery about this girl desperate
chances were ahead with life and
death in the balance and a dragging
water-soaked dress might prove just
the difference between success or fail-
ure

  side by side they slipped into the
dark depths of the bay it seemed al-
most pleasantly warm and restful in
the water after the driving wind and
whipped spume of the rocks and beach

  shoulder to shoulder they drove
along swimming silently colfax had
always believed himself pretty good
in the water but the girl amazed him
her little head bobbed along beside
him as she swam with such smooth
easy grace that not a ripple was left
to mark her course and once as her
face turned toward him he could have
sworn that she smiled

  as the shadow of the big amphibian
plane grew above them colfax moved
with increasing caution treading
water he listened there was not a
sound except the dim song of the
wind and the slow creak of restlessly
moving hulls easing himself along
the floating cabin of the sikorsky he
pulled himself up and tried the win-
dows

he knew a quick thrill when one of

them gave quietly he slid it open
then lowered himself back into the
water he faced the girl and beck-
oned her to him she slid in close
deft as an eel he wrapped one arm
about her waist and lifted her as high
as he could she caught the edge of
the window and began to struggle
upward

  he cupped his hands and cradled
both of her slim little feet in them
she seemed to lift with the supple
grace and ease of a shadow a mo-
ment her glistening outline hovered
there against the dark bulk of the
plane then she slid from sight
through the window

  colfax felt at his waist band and
drew out the knife that had already
drunk of the blood of two men in the
past few hours he edged his way to
the opposite side of the plane here
lay a narrow space black and un-
fathomable for the high wing of the
sikorsky swept clear above the launch
and the two crafts had been drawn
close together until hardly a foot of
space remained between the hulls
swinging across this space were the
two mooring lines

  purely by feel colfax found the
first line and severed it he found the
second it was tough seasoned and
water-soaked hemp which defied mo-
mentarily the knife edge impatient
colfax doubled a bight of it against
the hull of the launch and began saw-
ing at it it severed finally and for
the first time colfax felt that his ef-
forts at a daring escape might be des-
tined to success

  he slipped the knife back in his
belt caught the edge of the launch
and began pulling himself up at that
moment noiseless in rubber-soled
sneaks a shadowy bulk came in sight
on the deck of the boat

  deep consuming hatred brings a
strange sense of recognition from
the first colfax had hated the callous
brutality of the man stover and now
he recognized him thick and power-
ful


thrilling adventures

  stover taking in the situation in
a glance caught up a handy oar and
struck colfax jerked his head aside
as the oar flashed downward but he
was not quick enough to come wholly
clear true the stout ash splintered
to a stump in stovers hands as it
struck the gunwale of the launch but
that broken end whipped on and ca-
romed cruelly against the side of
colfaxs head

  he went under deep and far into
those murky black depths before his
agonized eyes flame was spangling the
turgid waters and his senses seemed
almost gone yet he did not go com-
pletely out strange thoughts whirled
crazily through his brain but out of
them came a clear cut image of elsa
sparlings face softly smiling it was
like a beacon light to colfax leading
him up and on

  he struggled back to the surface
felt his tortured head strike the
rounded bottom of the launch then
he broke clear of the water where he
could gulp the precious air for which
his stricken lungs were crying stover
was still there looming above him
brutal merciless and as intent on
hunting him down as a cat after a
mouse

  it was only the mans sadistic bru-
tality that saved colfax had stover
struck again it would have been the
end but so sure was he of his mas-
tery he reverted to savage torture
as colfaxs left hand reached for and
found the gunwale stover stepped on
it mashing and numbing those des-
perate fingers and with a low jeer-
ing laugh he placed the end of the
oar-stump against the others chest
and shoved him back and under water
again

  steve colfax had already discov-
ered that the bright vision of elsa
sparlings face was a force which
could spur him on to almost super-
human effort he now found that
pure blind insensate rage could do
much the same hardly realizing his
move he caught the stump of the oar

and jerked on it with all his weight
and strength

  this move caught stover off bal-
ance and pulled him to his knees one
arm sagging above the water and
before he could draw back colfax
shifted his grip from the oar stump
to the big brutes wrist

  snarling with fury stover braced
himself lunging back and up the
mans strength was enormous beast-
like he hauled colfax clear of the
water with no more apparent effort
than if he had been a dangling her-
ring colfaxs knees struck the gun-
wale of the launch as he was dragged
aboard he lurched to his feet stilt
clinging to that hairy wrist

  with his free hand stover now
drove a smashing blow at the face of
his leech colfax whipped under it
and lashed out with his own right
fist the blow caught stover full in
the mouth staggering him backward
with both hands pumping blows col-
fax bored in his lips peeled back in
a snarl

  jarred and befuddled by that first
punch stover swung wildly realiz-
ing that the battle he had begun with
such confidence was getting away
from him stover turned his head and
sent a wild yell pealing forth his
turned jaw made a full open target
and colfax hit that jaw as he had
never hit a man before

  the blow spun stover completely
around and dropped him half out of
the launch a moment the inert fig-
ure seemed to balance then before
the spent colfax could move it slith-
ered silently into the depths of the
bay

the succeeding moments were
somewhat of a nightmare to steve
colfax as he watched stovers body
slip limply away a great deal of his
own strength seemed to pour out of
him he had been long hours without
food hours filled with nerve strain
and terrific physical effort he had
battled ferociously his head had been
stolen cargo



cruelly clubbed-once by a gun in
the hands of the negro once by the
oar in the hands of stover

  only at the cost of tremendous
vital force had he come this far little
wonder that he now tottered weaving
back and forth on the deck of the
launch while the dark world spun
crazily about him and every atom of
his being cried for rest-rest

  and then his name was called softly
and vibrantly

  steve-hurry

  it was elsa sparlings voice and
he turned the sikorsky had drifted
several yards from the launch steve
shook his head and dived into the bay
in a few strokes he pulled even with
the door of the planes cabin and elsa
leaned from it and caught his hand
he struggled through and lay pant-
ing while she shut the door

  then she turned and dropped on
her knees beside him steve she
whispered oh-steve darling

  he gave her a twisted grin and
fumbled his way to his feet and then
to the controls with movements
purely automatic he switched on the
dashlight and clicked on the ignition
as the starters began to grind he
glanced over the instrument board
he thought of how helpless he and
elsa still were if the motors refused
to catch

  but the thought was an injustice
for the eighteen faithful cylinders
snorted spat then caught-settling
down to a cacophony of sound that
washed back in roaring encourage-
ment six hundred horse-power lay
in the throats of those cylinders and
they were his to answer to his touch

  with a queer waspish snap some-
thing lashed through both sides of the
cabin not a foot from colfaxs head
instantly he understood someone was
shooting at them evidently that last
wild yell of stovers had brought some
of the gang back to the landing and
the thunder of the motors had warned
of escape

  instantly colfax jazzed the right

motor and gave hard left rudder the
big plane scuttled around skimming
like a frightened water bird he
pointed the nose at the open sea
warming the motors desperately not
a miss in their smooth song and he-
exulted in them blessing the honest
craftsmen who had built them

  at the mouth of the bay he gave
the plane a lift and it came up lightly
easily taking off like a teal into the
wind-swept night he watched the
altimeter needle as it crept upward
to a thousand two thousand-five
thousand feet he banked to the north
and leveled out and as the sikorsky
settled to its course colfax looked
out and back

  far below and back he caught sight
of twin jets of pale blue flame and
the vague shadow of a racing biplane
against the subdued silver of the sea
that other ship was after them col-
fax shrugged no doubt they had the
speed on him but he couldnt see how
they could stop him

elsa sparling had crept up be-
hind him and he looked at her
even in the sick agony of his own
worn and beaten self he found time
to marvel at the uncrushable sweet-
ness of her she had unearthed a robe
that had been left in the plane and
had swathed herself in it until only
face and tousled auburn head were
visible he smiled at her and saw her
catch her breath a dawning lovely
smile answered him then one slim
white arm came out and rested across
his shoulders

  mindful of the pursuit colfax sent
the sikorsky towering seven thou-
sand then eight nine-and finally ten
thousand feet they had climbed to
a strange dark world the dashlight
hung thin jagged shadows about the
cabin etching strange outlines

  queer he thought the sense of
comfort and safety that single tiny
spark of light gave there in that tow-
ering altitude yet below lay only a
vast emptiness that reached down and


thrilling adventures

ever down to the wind-whipped sea
they were alone deliciously but ter-
ribly alone and roaring up behind
coming closer all the time was the
biplane

  as colfax remembered it from the
quick survey he had made in the dusk
the biplane was a two-place job no
doubt there would be a gunman in one
of the cockpits that sailor along the
beach had carried a rifle and a rifle
had been fired at them just before the
take-off

  yet shooting from one plane at an-
other was not the easiest thing in the
world to do despite the size of the
plane shot at of course there was
always the chance of a hit in some
vital part of the amphibians mechan-
ism so he nodded toward the rear
of the cabin

  in that rear locker he told elsa
a seat pack chute get it and put
it on

  she nodded and left him soon she
was back lugging the chute but she
made no move to get into it

  put it on he ordered again a
trifle sharply

  she shook her head no if there
was another for you i would but i
wont leave you no matter what hap-
pens now dont shout at me it wont
do any good

  colfax cursed without knowing it
all the effort that has gone before
will be wasted if you get stubborn
now elsa sparling he growled put
it on i say

  no she smiled gently but there
was no mistaking her stubborn deter-
mination ive a better idea you
put it on if-if we have to leap well
do it together and the one chute
will have to carry both of us

  he shrugged helplessly the
chute and harness would hold us but
our speed of fall would be dangerous

  there is water beneath us she
reminded

  colfax knew that he wouldnt leave
the plane unless something made bail-
ing out absolutely necessary that

they might have to jump was a long
chance anyhow so he nodded and
stood up crouching over the controls

strap it on me then he snapped

chapter vii

the long leap

with the chute in
place colfax re-
sumed his seat

 in that same
locker there are some
rope ends he said
bring a couple of
the longest and keep
them handy

  as he spoke these words a metallic
hornet ripped suddenly through the
cabin crashing at an oblique angle
into the instrument board before him
he flashed a swift glance around and
saw the biplane almost even with
them and slightly above and it was
close but short yards away even as
he looked he saw a pencil of flame
lick out mushrooming slightly there
was a jar and a tinkling sound and
his altimeter was a welter of shattered
glass and metal

  colfax threw the amphibian down
into a long side-slip wobbling it
slightly as though almost out of con-
trol but this maneuver did not fool
his pursuer for the biplane followed
closely a dim dark shape streaming
the red and blue fires of exhaust

  colfax let the big ship down still
more in a whistling ponderous slide
that tossed off thousands of feet of
altitude elsa was beside him again
her arm once more across his shoul-
ders a wave of emotion gripped
steve colfax swelling his throat
she was superb and how he adored
her

  he felt no amazement at this dis-
covery it seemed quite natural that
his roughneck lone wolf heart-free
life was over this slim brave thor-
oughbred had just cupped his heart
in her hands and taken it from him
he reached up one grimy paw raw
stolen cargo



and red and scarred from the wound
across his knuckles and patted her
hand her arm tightened convulsively
about his shoulders

  another bullet snapped against the
cabin wall and elsa sparling flinched
and cried out softly he turned his
head the robe had slid away from
her right shoulder slightly and there
on the point of her shoulder was a red
angry slash from which the carmine
was already welling

  colfax gave a queer husky moan
and rocked from side to side in his
seat he went berserk he looked and
saw the biplane in close again he
side-slipped once more grudgingly-
a feint this time the biplane rose to
the bait like a bloodmad wolf it
started an angling dive after its
quarry again colfaxs thin cold smile
was a grimace far removed from any-
thing resembling mirth he pulled
the sikorsky into a stiff bank slashed
across intervening space then leveled
out and zoomed sharply

  the biplane caught cold in front
of him tried a diving bank but it
wasnt quite fast enough colfax saw
the shadow of that upraised wing dead
before the cabin prow then he was
into it

  a bedlam of rippling and crashing
buffeted through above the roar of
the motors the sikorsky wallowed
like an over-loaded boat in a heavy
sea but it struggled clear wobbling
dangerously he fought it to an even
keel and looked down

  there a dark whirling blot was
dropping away a lop-sided stricken
blot that was tumbling crazily and
of a sudden it seemed to split still
further asunder colfax knew what
had happened the impact had ripped
off one wing and now the hurtling
biplane had shucked the other the
fuselage with motor and human
freight was gone like a plummet
this was as bloody and gory as war

  elsa had him by the arm shaking
him

  look she gasped fire

  colfax looked and his heart con-
tracted his right-hand motor was a
mass of greenish gasoline fire the
forward movement of the plane
sweeping those licking banners of hell
back across the fabric of the wing

automatically he reached

for the landing flare release
pale arcs of fire began dropping down
colfax held the controls hard over
dropping the sikorsky off in a slide to
the left sending that deadly fire
streaming out along the right wing
tip it was tough losing out at this
point just when they had cleared the
last obstacle he stood up holding
the controls over

  elsa he said his voice tense but
quiet weve got to jump dear loop
that rope about your waist and mine
tie it-tight

  fumbling slightly she obeyed his
free arm went about her

  remember no matter what hap-
pens i worship your very shadow i
had to tell you that-now and there
is still a chance those flares-and a
passing ship afraid

  she pulled his head down and
kissed him

  not now she murmured

  the sikorsky was wobbling danger-
ously fighting to lurch out of the
slide colfax let go of the controls
lifted the girl against him and stepped
to the cabin door he kicked it wide
a gust of choking fumes struck his
nostrils and flame lanced and leered
back at them his right arm tightened
about his precious burden his left
hand pushed between their bodies and
locked on the ring of the rip cord
one long look he took into her up-
turned face then he dived out into
space

  a slow count to ten to let that flam-
ing plane slip well away from them
before he pulled the rip cord and so
for several seconds they were uncon-
trollable atoms in a vast and foreign
element then at colfaxs quick
movement the spring mechanism as-


thrilling adventures

serted itself the chute snaked out
above them like a column of smoke
and then bloomed magically the
risers snapped tight and the jerk
spun them upright and around and
around but their fall was checked
and they began floating down into
nothingness

  they saw the amphibian fall away
spinning now in an inferno of flame
the left motor still screaming a wild
uncontrolled song of death it was
soon gone-dwindling dwindling un-
til it struck the waves with a thun-
derous impact that carried back in a
rumbling echo then it was gone com-
pletely

  the ensuing quiet was almost pain-
ful below a wide area of water
gleamed queer and ghastly under the
radiance of the landing flares and as
colfax looked down his heart beat
hopefully once more across that sea
of radiance bobbed a small vessel with
green and red riding lights like pin-
pricked eyes

  colfax found that his cheek was
pressed tightly against an auburn
crown of hair he spoke evenly
calmly

  theres a boat down there elsa
weve got a real chance but ive got
to slip the chute-drift as close as
possible to the boat before we hit the
water i need both hands wrap your
arms around me below my armpits
and hold tight dearest-hold tight

  her arms gripped him convulsively
colfax reached upward gathering the
shrouds in his hands pulling hard
the chute slipped off rapidly fight-
ing the wind the sea rose to meet
them the first flare had struck the
water and guttered out the others
were desperately close and colfax
knew that he needed that remaining
light

  it was only a case of moments but
they were untold ages to the aviator
another flare went out the circle of
radiance dimmed but he saw dark
figures racing about the boat then
the water had them with a dragging

strangling impact that gulped and
smothered the shrouds and the
chute fabric settled about them tan-
gling and clutching

  colfax fought for air fought to
keep above the surface the choking
water filled his throat agonized
lights flashed before his eyes then
a deep restful silence seemed to en-
velope him he drifted down down
down- here was rest at last

steve colfax awoke from a
tremendous sleep he felt as
though he had slept for a month he
seemed stupid and befogged and still
tired so he lay with his eyes closed
his mind fuddled gradually he be-
came aware of a smooth measured rise
and dip almost as though he was being
rocked in a cradle this he reasoned
wearily was queer he wasnt an in-
fant any longer and there was no
cause for anyone to rock him

  his mind cleared presently and he
opened his eyes to look around he
found to his astonishment that he lay
in a narrow bunk against a wall
above him were open portholes
through which sunshine and crisp salt
air poured the ceiling above him
was stoutly beamed and across a nar-
row space on the far wall two other
bunks were racked both empty sus-
pended above him was a ships lan-
tern

  the narrow door at the end of the
cabin opened and through it came
one of the most immense men he had
ever seen the gigantic fellow had to
stoop to enter and he gave the im-
pression of coming in sideward as
though his great shoulders were too
wide for the door the newcomer was
swarthy with a bristling black beard
and a great unruly mane of curly
black hair at sight of colfaxs open
and inquiring eyes the giant ex-
claimed in satisfaction

  hah msieu is wake up at last
eh he rumbled sacre bleu dat
is good for sure pierre ledouc is
frighten you sleep and sleep lak

bear in winter tam msieu how you
feel now

  colfax yawned something like
rip van winkle must have felt
whats it all about anyhow and
where am i

  you are aboard the good fishing
boat la belle france msieu you
come down from sky at night-lak
wounded bird don you remember
msieu

  colfax remembered and came up-
right with a jerk

  elsa he exclaimed miss spar-
ling-the girl with me-where is
she

  the giant put forth a great paw and
pushed him back down on the berth
firmly

  mamselle is on deck sitting in the
sun msieu for her have no fear
you are the one who has frighten us
but you are bettair now perhaps you
lak for eat someting no

  as the flood tide of his relief passed
colfax realized that he did feel quite
famished he grinned weakly

  that is a real idea my good
friend he said gratefully i am
starving but what has happened
since i passed out

  all in good time msieu said the
huge pierre sympathetically he
stuck his head out of the cabin door
and let out a roar that could have been
heard a mile away emil make
hurry with dat food our guest is
hongry lak wolf in winter

  there came an answering bellow
from the tiny galley and very shortly
a second mammoth fisherman crowded
into the little cabin bearing a tray
of steaming dishes he was younger
than the first but there was a close
resemblance his face was clean-
shaven and wreathed in a friendly
grin

  bacon and eggs and coffee msieu
he rumbled just lak hotel on shore
grinning like a pair of delighted
children the two fishermen watched
their uest clean his plate and drain
the last drop of his coffee when he

looked up pleadingly the elder le-
douc shook his head

  no msieu you are still hongry
yes but it is not well dat you eat too
much at first now i tink dat emil
help you dress and you go up on deck
for talk with mamselle she have
plenty for speak with you

final adjustments

finding that he
was pretty weak and
shaky colfax was
glad to accept the aid
of the ledoucs in
scrubbing himself
and putting antisep-
tic and adhesive and
gauze dressing on his
wounds and scratches then he strug-
gled into his clothes which to his
surprise had been washed and dried
for him

  next he felt of his bristling chin
and was surprised again to note the
length of the stubble he looked at
emils smoothly shaven face en-
viously the other grinned and
nodded he went out to return
shortly with razor soap and hot
water there was a small battered
mirror on the wall so colfax managed
a fair job of shaving

 elsa was waiting anxiously when
he went on deck at her colfax stared
in amazement she was dressed
rather she was swallowed in a huge
flannel shirt and a pair of equally
large dungarees faded from many
salt water washings there were nu-
merous tucks and folds and rolls in
the voluminous garments to make
them fit her slim form but even then
they did not conceal or mar her love-
liness

  under her feet the dull gray of a
fishing smack behind her the spark-
ling green waters of the dancing sea
a breeze crisp and fresh from the
east was tangled in the meshes of her


thrilling adventures

auburn hair and her sweet face was
looking bravely at him

  she was smiling and a great ache
filled colfaxs throat and spread
downward to his heart he thought
he had never seen anything so brave
so sweet so beautiful-and so unat-
tainable

  hello steve she greeted him ten-
derly i began to think youd never
wake up but captain ledouc reas-
sured me

 never wake up he repeated
glancing swiftly about at the deserted
expanse of peaceful sunlit shimmer-
ing sea what-how long-i mean
just what has-

  youve been out for nearly forty-
eight hours steve she informed as
he floundered and groped for compre-
hension i-i rather went to pieces
myself after the ledoucs dragged
us aboard i sort of had hysterics im
not exactly used to-to parachute
jumps in the middle of the night
forty-eight hours he exclaimed
incredulously weve got to get busy
we must notify the police-send a
force to dog rocks-get you back to
the mainland-this boat isnt moving
elsa why arent we back in port by
now what-

  why she asked calmly what
is there to notify the police about
you cleaned up everything and every-
body at dog rocks except the woman
i dont have to get back home in a
hurry because gregory lyons will
vote my proxy as i want it voted and
the boat isnt moving because the mo-
tors broken down there have i
answered all your questions satisfac-
torily

  colfax stared at her and his own
excitement died down beneath her
cool and calm attitude he became his
old level-headed and reliant self

  what the hecks the matter with
you he growled eying her thought-
fully then he turned about and
yelled for pierre ledouc

  the old man came running

 show me the motor colfax

ordered i know something about
engines

 oui msieu agreed ledouc
glancing at the girl

  he led colfax below where henri
his second son labored with the
cranky engine colfax got to work
immediately it didnt take him thirty
minutes to put the partly dismantled
motor back together and learn that
part of the distributor was missing
when the big henri looked blank
colfax immediately sought out elsa
sparling grimly

  wheres that part of the electrical
gadget you stole off the motor he
demanded sternly

 before his uncompromising de-
meanor she flushed she did not speak
as she dug the missing part out of one
of the big pockets of her borrowed
garb and handed it to him he took it
without a word and returned to the
engine in ten minutes the motor was
roaring smoothly and colfax ordered
a course set for dog rocks at once

  do as he says pierre agreed elsa
sparling as the huge captain ledouc
looked at her in interrogation

shrugging his shoulders and
shaking his head in bewilderment
pierre complied when they were well
on their way colfax found time to
speak to the girl

 why he asked why did you
do it

  the crisis was over and you were
worn out she answered defensively
why shouldnt i have done it

  worn out that was true colfax
had been just about finished when he
made that parachute jump now he
was finished he realized suddenly
that he was back where he had started
years ago he didnt have a thing in
the world save the clothes he stood in
with the loss of his plane he had
lost the last bit of tangible property
he had possessed and also his means
of earning a livelihood of course
thered be a reward of some kind for
elsa sparling but he couldnt take it
stolen cargo



  he didnt want any money for what
he had done he wasnt sure that he
would even let her replace his lost
plane all he knew was that he loved
her with all of his heart and she was
as unattainable as the stars

  i guess you were right he said
gruffly thanks

  he turned and went back toward
the stern elsa stared after him bit-
ing her nether lip angrily

  you proud and stubborn idiot she
whispered under her breath i could
box your ears until they would ring
like a fire alarm what do you expect
me to do-go down on my knees to
you

  the fishing smack didnt make it to
dog rocks before the sun set emil
at the port gunwale gave a shout and
pointed off to the southeast there
resplendent in the setting sun was a
pure white yacht heading for them
gracefully

  the two boats covered the inter-
vening water rapidly and a tall man
in whites with the gold bars of a cap-
tain on his shoulders hailed them from
the bridge of the pleasure craft

  ahoy he shouted as both vessels
cut off power can you give us any
word of- great scott it-can that
be you yourself miss sparling

it didnt take long to bring both
crafts to rest and establish con-
tact the yacht captain himself came
aboard the la belle france he doffed
his cap and wrung elsas hand heart-
ily

 miss sparling-thank god he
ejaculated when you werent on
the island and the woman we picked
up there by the name of findlay told
us of your escape and andrews pur-
suit we thought-we thought-

  i know captain jenkins elsa
said her own voice quivering slightly
in recollection ive been very lucky
this is the embodiment of my good
fortune-mr steve colfax i want
you to meet my protector and savior
steve this is the captain of my yacht

and an old old friend-captain jen-
kins

 the two men shook hands

 youve been to dog rocks and
picked up maude findlay colfax

asked

  yes said jenkins she was the
sole survivor she has confessed the
whole thing and i want to thank you
deeply for your splendid rescue of
miss sparling i will ask you later
for the details

 how did you happen to go to dog
rocks asked elsa

 when mr lyons appeared at the
directors meeting to vote your proxy
the forged proxy was revealed jen-
kins explained byers broke down
and confessed and weve been comb-
ing this area in search of you ever
since and now may i conduct you
aboard your own vessel

  yes thank you captain said elsa
sweetly will you please take care
of pierre ledouc for me come on
steve

 as jenkins drew a heavy wallet
from his pocket and went over to en-
gage in conversation with the owner
of the fishing smack colfax drew
closer to elsa sparling

  i guess this had better be good-by
right here elsa he murmured your
lawyers can get in touch with me if
my testimony is needed at the trial
ill stay with the ledoucs and work
my way back to port

  steve colfax are you crazy she
demanded incredulously

 i dont think so he answered
curtly

 then stop acting like a child
come lower me into the yachts gig

  certainly he said but im tell-
ing you good-by now elsa-

 you mean you are not going back
on my yacht with me she demanded
flatly

 well-no he growled

  all right she said nodding we
wont use the yacht im staying with
you whats good enough for you is
good enough for me


thrilling adventures

  elsa he groaned

  she came so close that her head
rested against his chest

  do you or dont you love me steve
colfax she asked frankly did you
mean what you said just before we
made that parachute jump or didnt
you

  elsa he repeated and his voice
trembled that was when i thought
we were going to die and it wouldnt
make any difference what i said of
course i meant every word

  and now that were going to live
it makes a difference she persisted

  you know it does im broke-
penniless-a roughneck things just
wouldnt work out for us elsa i just
can t 

  steve colfax look at me she
commanded reaching up and pulling
at his chin didnt i tell you that i
wanted to learn more about rough-
necks and whos going to look after

my interests now that andrews and
byers turned crooked is everybody
going to desert me

 but ive nothing to offer you
elsa- he began

 you are rich in the things that
count steve colfax she said cour-
age faith honor all i have to offer
you is money and i-i want-i
need you so desperately steve weve
looked on danger and disaster side
by side with our arms about each
other we looked on the face of death
-and leaped surely we are not afraid
to face life-and live and-oh damn
it steve colfax are you going to
make me propose to you

 no he roared sweeping her up
in his arms in a mighty embrace that
made the huge ledoucs and the crew
of the yacht stare wide-eyed in
amazement at least i can do that
much for myself

  and he did so quite satisfactorily

the lash cut into hedges body

a beachcomber hurls his defi at the brutal white
king of a south sea island

by johnston mcculley

                     author of trailed by two speared etc

the tumbling sea was deep
blue the isle of batu was
emerald green with a border
of golden strand and the coral reefs
were pink and white but the sky
was a dirty saffron so capn bill
clarn drove his schooner rover to-
ward the protected lagoon with her
sails bellying and her bow lifting over
the rolling seas

  shes fixin to blow plenty clarn
said to dave gordon well have to
weigh anchor

  yes shell blow plenty gordon
agreed glancing at the threatening
sky

  well weather it here at batu
clarn decided the lagoon is well
protected and theres a good holdin
bottom a visit to batu may be as




thrilling adventures

 interestin experience for you too
 its luke hedges place

   ive heard of him

   double what youve heard and
 then you wont have the half of it
 clarn looked at the saffron sky and
 spat over the rail into the boiling sea
 ive been playing around the islands
 all my life i had my boyhood in the
 singapore dives ive seen plenty of
 hard men but luke hedges is the
 worst

   sort of island king gordon
 asked

   more like an island devil runnin
 his own private hell on earth hedges
 spends half his time thinkin up ways
 to make the natives cringe and shiver
 why dont they leave him
 cant no boats and batu is a dis-
 tance from other islands hedges
 keeps em marooned wont even let
 em have a fishin canoe

   the authorities-

   they dont bother batu is small
 and off the beaten track no official
 complaints i suppose hedges goes
 his own way wolfin down food and
 soakin in gin stackin his copra and
  ell now and then a tradin schooner
 puts in and buys his stuff and leaves
 supplies hedges doesnt seem to care
 about gettin rich never leaves the
 island sits in his bungalow or prowls
 around with a whip in his hand and
 plays king

   its a wonder somebody doesnt
 slip a knife between his ribs gordon
 said

   a native tried that once when
 hedges ordered the wrong girl to
 move into his bungalow oh yes hes
 that sort he chooses a new queen
 ever so often what hedges did to
 that native was a lesson the others
 havent forgotten the mans a devil
 wait till you see him well go ashore
 soon as we anchor

 the schooner was driving in to-
 ward the mouth of the lagoon and
 clarn gave his attention to his ship
 gordon watched the island hedges

bungalow could be seen a distance
back from the beach with a winding
path leading to it apart from the
bungalow was a small warehouse

  no native craft was drawn up on
the shingle nobody was in sight
the palms were commencing to sway
wildly in the wind but nobody was
making preparations against the com-
ing storm

  the rover scudded into the lagoon
like a gull riding with the wind
clarn barked orders and canvas ran
down and the anchor splashed the
kanaka crew worked swiftly expertly
making everything shipshape for the
blow clarn gave orders to his kanaka
mate and a skiff was dropped

  well go ashore gordon clarn
said if the blow is bad well stay
the night

  clarn oared the light skiff and gor-
don watched the beach still he saw
no sign of life it was uncanny for
a schooner to put in at a place like
this where craft seldom touched gen-
erally was enough to bring all the na-
tives tumbling down to the waters
edge but batu looked deserted

  the skiff touched shore and gor-
don helped clarn pull it far up on the
shingle they started up the winding
path

  a few feet ahead of them somebody
suddenly broke through the jungle
growth and stumbled into the path
they saw it was a human being of
some sort with rags for clothes half
his body bare and filthy he had a
scraggly beard and his eyes burned
he lumbered toward them gordon
slipped his hand into his coat pocket
and gripped the stubby automatic he
had there

  they made out that the creature
before them was a white man he
straightened his body as he came on
toward them and they could see he
had a huge frame but with little meat
on it he held out his hands to them
imploringly

 take me away from here he
begged take me away
beast of batu



  before gordon or clarn could speak
a roar came from the bungalow a
hoarse human voice bellowing above
the rush of the wind and the smash-
ing of breakers on the reefs

slimy get away from there
the man in the path flinched at
sound of the voice he glanced to-
ward the bungalow and plunged back
into the jungle growth

 a man appeared on the veranda of
the bungalow he stood with his feet
planted far apart swaying drunkenly
he wore clean whites but his feet
were bare and his shirt was open in
front down to his belt a stubble of
dark beard covered his face and his
mass of bushy black hair was un-
kempt

  this way gentlemen he called
welcome to batu

  thats luke hedges clarn whis-
pered to gordon

hedges waited on the top step
to greet them they saw he was
short and thick in body but he did
not give the impression of having
great physical strength he looked
like a man of whom dissipation had
taken heavy toll

  my old friend capn bill clarn
hedges greeted come to trade
havent anything with me to
trade clarn replied i happened to
be in these seas and saw a blow corn-
in so thought id anchor in your la-
goon and give you a visit

 youre moren welcome your
friend

 hes dave gordon hes thinkin
of goin into trade and is makin a
trip with me to get acquainted
come in hedges urged id have
shaved and put on my shoes if id
known you were cornin

 he chuckled and waddled across
the veranda to hold open the screened
door of the bungalow clarn and gor-
don went up the steps and entered
they found the spacious living room
clean and comfortably furnished a
large round table was in the center

of the room with easy chairs around
it a bottle of gin and glasses were
ready they took the customary
drink of welcome and sprawled in the
easy chairs

  excuse me a minute hedges said
he got up and strode out on the ve-
randa and struck a huge gong which
hung near the railing and the wind
carried the reverberating deep tone
thats to let my people know they
can come out of hidin and go about
their business he explained as he
returned to the table when i see
a ship puttin in i hit the gong and
they hide themselves they stay hid-
den till i know whos cornin i dont
want strangers to spoil em

  we noticed a white man in the
path clarn said

  yes i suppose you might call him
a white man hedges replied thats
slimy

  friend of yours

  hedges glowered at him i dont
make friends of beachcombers capn
slimy showed up here about a year
ago got kicked off some tradin
schooner or jumped overboard and
swam ashore i never did learn the
truth of it-i was drunk at the time
ive made him useful named him
slimy because thats the way he
looks

  doesnt he want to get away
clarn asked

  possibly but i need him here
hedges replied there was a time
when white men walked on me so
i came here where i could walk on
natives and along comes slimy un-
invited whos a white man in a man-
ner of speakin and its my pleasure to
walk on him squarin accounts
slimy never did me a wrong but hes
a sort of symbol of men who did

  is that justice hedges clarn
asked

  on the island of batu capn jus-
tice is what i make it hedges re-
plied lets change the subject
drink up i hope youll stay the
night


thrilling adventures

 hedges clapped his hands and a
native houseboy came into the room

 two guests for dinner and to
spend the night hedges told him
we want a good dinner fix up the
guest cots

the native boy lit the oil lamps
bowed and disappeared hedges
poured fresh drinks it grew darker
the velocity of the wind increased
clam stepped out on the veranda and
saw that his schooner had her riding
lights burning he could trust his
kanaka mate and crew he returned
to the table

  i have an idea for a good joke
clarn overheard gordon saying to
hedges this man slimy-i wonder
how hed act if he was one of us for
the evening

 hedges bent forward how do
you mean

  make him bathe and shave and toss
him some clean clothes let him be
one of us for a few hours we may
get a good laugh out of him trying to
act like a gentleman

 that would be rich hedges
roared slimy a perfect gentleman
for one evenin a lousy beach-
comber

  hed probably make a lot of funny
blunders gordon continued i re-
member hearing how bully tarvish
played a trick like that youve heard
of him

 who hasnt heard of bully tar-
vish hedges said what a trader
he knew how to handle natives he
disappeared a few years ago after
sellin out some say he went to
europe to live like a king

 it may interest you to know
clarn put in that my schooner be-
longed to bully tarvish i bought
her from the man who got her from
bully

  my stepfather knew tarvish well
gordon added my stepfather was
sam mannering

 hedges looked at him with sudden
respect mannering was before my

time but ive heard of him made a
fortune in trade didnt he

  yes he told me many yarns about
bully tarvish once when a chink
ran amuck with a knife tarvish
saved my stepfathers life

  i cant see a man like tarvish goin
to europe and livin soft clarn de-
clared be like a fish out of water
a man used to roarin around sailin
his own ship bossin natives and mak-
in his own deals-

  he didnt go to europe gordon
said he went back to the states
where he was born i had a line on
him a couple of years ago

  that joke of yours mr gordon-
lets not forget that hedges put in
well do it

  he got up and waddled out on the
veranda again struck the gong twice
and waited at the top of the steps

  clarn glanced at gordon swiftly
whats the idea behind this joke
business he whispered

  careful gordon warned glanc-
ing toward hedges its just a little
experiment watch me and follow
my lead

  they saw slimy come up to the
bottom of the steps through the gath-
ering gloom summoned by the gong
the lantern swinging in the doorway
revealed his face to them clearly a
countenance in which hate and fear
were blended

  get inside slimy hedges or-
dered take a bath and shave and
make yourself decent tell the house-
boy to give you an old suit of my
clothes youre to eat and drink with
white men for a change get in
there

w ooking bewildered slimy shuf-
fled past him and into the living
room he glanced at gordon and
clarn but did not speak he went to
the rear of the house and hedges
laughed and returned to the table

 after quite a time slimy re-
turned his beard was gone and his
face was chalky white where the
beast of batu



beard had been he stood erect in a
clean suit of whites and had put on a
pair of old shoes his shirt was but-
toned up to the throat not wide open
like hedges

  good evenin mr slimy hedges
greeted sarcastically youre lookin
fine and prosperous sit down and
join us in a drink help yourself to a
cheroot too

   slimy swallowed hard and sat
down he started to slump in the
chair then suddenly straightened he
did not speak gordon expected him
to gulp his drink greedily but he
sipped it then put the glass on the
table and lit a cheroot the flare from
the match emphasized the cadaverous
appearance of his face

  mr slimy hasnt had alcohol or
tobacco these last few months
hedges said bein considerate of his
health ive forbidden it but you can
have all you want now mr slimy
slimy did not answer they waited
for some time for dinner when it
came hedges ate like a hog bending
over the table and shoveling food into
his enormous mouth washing it down
with gin and soda gordon and clarn
hid their disgust with difficulty they
watched slimy who ate like a gentle-
man finally sated with food and
drink they relaxed in the easy chairs

  it was hedges perhaps as a thrust
at slimy who turned the conversation
to failures and beachcombers

  when a man gets down he never
gets up again hedges declared

  i dont agree with you gordon
said a man may slip down the so-
cial scale for some reason but a little
thing may bring him up with a jerk
give him new life perhaps a situa-
tion where hes called on to show him-
self a man by helping others

  once down-and-out and always
down-and-out hedges said take
slimy here dont know what he ever
was but its plain what he is now-a
lousy beachcomber

  slimys face turned whiter and his
eyes glistened but he did not reply

  weve made him clean up and sit
at table with us hedges went on
think thatll reform him tomor-
row hell start goin to seed again
hedges refilled the glasses he
spilled the gin and was unable to get
out of his chair his voice was thick
when he howled for the houseboy to
fetch a fresh bottle

  outside the wind was screeching
across batu and the seas were pound-
ing the reefs clarn went to the ve-
randa once to make sure the rover
was all right

  genmen im gettin drunk
hedges said my boyll take care of
me and show you to your cots but
stay up and drink as long as you like
you slimy you can get out now
back to your hut you havent been
a damned bit of fun

  slimy stood erect and bowed to
gordon and clarn he had not been
drinking much and was cold sober

ceglentlemen the master of
the island speaks and i must
obey slimy said if i can go with
you when you leave work my pas-
sage-

  none of that hedges snarled
youll stay on batu slimy capn
clarn if you want to keep friendly
with me you wont take him

  hedges put his arms on the table
and dropped his head upon them and
gave a snore gordons eyes met
slimys squarely clarn watched them
sure that hedges was dead to the
world gordon reached into his coat
pocket took out his automatic and
slipped it to slimy

  not to be used for revenge gor-
don whispered

  slimy stuffed the gun out of sight
quickly good night gentlemen
slimy hurried from the room and
disappeared the houseboy and an-
other native came in lifted hedges
and carried him away the houseboy
returned and conducted gordon and
clarn to another room where guest
cots were ready


thrilling adventures

  stormll pass by mornin clarn
said as they undressed i think you
were a fool to give slimy that gun

  gordon smiled as he blew out the
lamp   

  slimy slipped and staggered through
the jungle growth until he came to a
cluster of huts beneath swaying coco
palms some of the natives were awake
and watching the storm slimy spoke
to several and they ran to other huts

  an hour later all gathered on the
beach at a spot where they could not
be seen from the bungalow if light-
ning flared in the sky they grouped
around slimy to hear what he said

  heavy swells entered the lagoon and
rolled across it but the smashing seas
were outside battering at the reefs
the schooner rose and fell rolled and
tipped slimy spoke rapidly then
went to where clarns skiff rested on
the shingle

  they launched the skiff and three
men got into it with slimy they
pulled laboriously toward the
schooner making slow progress
against the force of the wind behind
the skiff and on either side of it were
the swimmers

  men and women and children the
natives of batu were swimming out to
the schooner following the skiff
slimy had guessed there would be no
lookout on such a night the skiff was
made fast to a line at the stern the
natives swam around the vessel slimy
and two others gained the deck and
worked rapidly in the darkness drop-
ping lines the natives swarmed
aboard

 slimy howled yellowish light
gleamed as the door of the forecsl
was opened the kanaka mate rushed
out with the few members of the
crew he found slimy confronting
him a stern figure in drenched whites
with automatic held ready

  up sail slimy ordered

  the kanaka mate howled at his men
and charged slimy chopped with the
gun and the mate sprawled on the
deck

  up sail he barked at the kanakas
were goin out the winds right
and i can take the ship through the
reefs

 he drove them to it they were
frightened of the storm afraid to
handle the schooner in it but were
more afraid of slimy and the gun he
held

checked and accounted for the
natives of batu huddled where
they could at the wheel slimy
watched a white frothing line of
breakers his voice cracked above the
roar of the storms as he howled orders
intermittently

  the kanakas were used to obeying
and they obeyed slimy conscious
again the mate crawled back to the
wheel and slimy bent over him

  sorry i had to smash you he said
im takin the rover out tell you
about it later get as many of these
folks under cover as you can-women
and children the men can shift for
themselves

  under shortened sail the schooner
plunged at the mouth of the lagoon
her bow dipped under and reared sick-
eningly she lurched and righted ran
before the wind like a wild thing with
her rail awash half the time

  then she was out and free a prey of
the tumbling seas and pounding
waves she seemed to spring from sea
to sea as she went through the black
night with slimy fighting the wheel
the kanakas were quiet the batu
natives looked to slimy to win
through

  so the rover traveled through the
night and out of the direct path of the
storm the raging wind lessened but
the great seas remained as an after-
math of the blow slimy had speech
with the kanaka mate and seemed to
satisfy him on several points

  he was a different slimy the air
of command was about him his voice
had a sharp bark when there were
orders to give his emaciated body
was erect and he gripped the wheel
beast of batu



with such force that his knuckles
were white

  the gray dawn found the schooner
plunging on

  back at batu the same dawn found
clarn and gordon springing off their
cots as they heard hedges bellowing
and smashing at the gong on the
veranda they dressed and hurried
out hedges was raving

  not a damned native around the
house he cried ill skin em alive
thought id sleep till noon

  clarn and gordon went out on the
veranda clarns first glance was to-
ward where his schooner should have
been riding when he found the ves-
sel gone his wild cry made gordon
snap around

  clarn ran down the steps and along
the path to the beach with gordon at
his heels hedges remained on the
veranda

  skiffs gone too clarn howled
what-

  i imagine youll find every native
on the island gone gordon said
slimy has removed them from
hedges brutality

  slimy you think he took the
schooner out

  thats what i think

  then shes lost clarn said i
wouldnt have taken her out myself in
that blow

  hedges had charged through the
jungle growth howling like a madman
and now came rushing back

  every lousy son ofm is gone he
bellowed they took your schooner
clarn theyre all shark meat now
and serve em right

four days later early in the
morning a sail appeared clarn
saw it first and his cry brought gor-
don and hedges

  hedges was a sodden wreck he had
been drinking heavily during the four
days clarn and gordon had cooked
the meals and kept the bungalow
clean

  shes puttin in hedges said

hope its some trader i know well
ill have him get me natives he
waddled away

  anyhow well have a chance to get
away from this rotten hedges clarn
growled wonder if ill ever find
any trace of the rover

  if you dont ill fit you out with a
new schooner gordon said i feel
a sort of responsibility

  hedges called to them and they
went into the bungalow in his drunken
stupor hedges had some idea of pre-
paring to greet guests and he begged
gordon and clarn to help him put the
house to rights

  out on the veranda a few minutes
later clarn gave a wild cry as he
looked at the approaching craft she
tacked and clarn recognized her in-
stantly

  its the rover he shouted cant
fool me about my own ship shes
lived to come back

  the schooner was charging straight
at the mouth of the lagoon clarn and
gordon started down the winding
path and hedges followed slowly the
schooner entered the lagoon and they
could hear a hoarse voice bellowing
orders sails ran down and the anchor
was dropped the skiff was put over-
side

  two kanakas jumped into the skiff
and were followed by a white man
the skiff came toward shore the
white man in the stern was wearing an
old captains cap

  its slimy clarn roared

  slimy hedges thundered ill
skin him alive ill tear his back to
pieces with my whip he was hold-
ing the whip he so often had used on
his natives

  clarns face was a blank as the skiff
touched shore and the kanakas pulled
it up on the shingle slimy strode to-
ward them with the kanakas behind
him as the three neared those ashore
the kanaka mate began shouting at
clarn defending himself saying he
had been made to do what he had done
clarn howled for him to be silent


thrilling adventures

  slimy stopped a few feet in front of
them

  capn clarn dont blame your mate
or men he said i seized your
schooner the other night-an act of
piracy i suppose but i brought her
back in good condition i could have
jumped her you know

  im waitin to hear what you did
clarn said

  i was on batu almost a year slimy
explained id gone down the social
scale had a lot of money once and
clever folks got it away from me
tried to mix with those not my kind
and paid for it lost my grip and
couldnt seem to find it again
well clarn questioned

  i was on a tradin schooner that
went past batu and went overside and
swam ashore didnt know there was a
trader here id been here before and
knew there were fine natives intended
to live here till i got the liquor out of
my system to straighten up and make
a fresh start and i found hedges
here

  you rati hedges howled

ffw saw how hedges was mis-
jbl treatin the natives but i
couldnt do anything to help em in-
side a week i wanted to kill hedges
but he had me i couldnt get off the
island i had to take his abuse if id
killed him the first schooner that put
in- well theyd have taken me
away to swing and i didnt intend to
swing for a swine like hedges he did
me one favor though when he denied
me liquor my health improved and
my strength came back

  about the schooner clarn sug-
gested

  simple enough capn i got all the
natives aboard held a gun on your
mate made the crew get up sail and
went out of the lagoon i sailed to
another island near enough for all the
natives to jump overboard and swim
ashore to tell the story i told em
how to make complaints about hedges
and therell soon be a gunboat drop-

pin in here to see about it then i
brought the schooner back

  piracy clarn declared but you
-you sailed her out into that storm
and got her through thats some
sailin mister

  hedges charged forward suddenly
his whip uplifted

 you lousy beachcomber he
screeched take my natives away
and cause me trouble will you

  the lash sang through the air but
the blow did not fall slimy side-
stepped neatly and caught hedges
descending arm he tore the whip
from hedges grasp and the lash sang
again and descended and cut into
hedges hoglike body

  clarn and gordon stood aside
slimy struck repeatedly while hedges
cringed and howled and tried to wrap
his arms around his head finally he
stumbled to his knees and then
sprawled in the sand slimy stepped
back

  that wasnt for the things youve
done to me he said that was for
what you did to the natives you scum
now you can stay here alone on batu
till the gunboat comes theyll take
you away fast enough

  he tossed the whip out into the
water and faced clarn again

  i suppose you want to get aboard
capn you and mr gordon he said
ill go along and take what you want
to hand me itll be worth it

  they left the sobbing hedges
sprawled in the sand and walked
slowly down to the skiff the kanaka
mate and the man with him waded out
and started swimming to the schooner
without speaking the three white
men got into the skiff and clam
picked up the oars

  stealin a schooner at the point of
a gun is somethin serious clarn said
as he rowed methodically i cant
deny that im in sympathy with why
you did it and you sure showed good
seamanship takin her through that
storm

  shes a fine schooner slimy com-
beast of batu



plimented and when a man knows
a ship-

 you know the rover clarn
broke in

  i know her well know every inch
of her she was my ship once im
bully tarvish

  youre tarvish clarn howled
his eyes widening

wwhats right i cashed in and
-h- went back to the states some
years ago then went on to europe
and let myself get swindled out of all

i	had lost faith in human nature
too on account of a worthless woman
worked my way back to the islands
but kept away from my friends went
down the social scale and now ill
take what you want to hand me capn
for seizin your schooner but ill be
decent after the laws done with me
youre doin yourself no good if
you start a long term in jail clarn
replied his eyes twinkling well
just say that youd been named my
mate before you took the schooner out
thatll make it simple

  i guessed you were tarvish gor-
don said i saw you once when i was

a boy my stepfather made me prom-
ise as he was dying that id always
be ready to do you any favor i could
because you saved his life once
wanted to be sure so i coaxed
hedges into making you shave and
clean up and sit at table with us it

a she-cougar fights for

of the she-cougar rippled with
pleasure under one of her huge fore-
paws was a squirming spotted kitten
a vigorous little male although his
teeth were scarcely cut he put up a

routine ablutions

yeepeks curved talons sank into the tender back of a female kitten

                        
the fangs of otan



three this was practically their first
day outside the cave lair and at once
otans troubles had begun she had
nursed her brood and then had begun
their ablutions the other two were
close by-rolling tumbling snarling
as they played at least otan was
sure they had been close to her

  it was the sudden soosh of rushing
wings that gave her warning to the
contrary with a snarl she whirled
and leaped all in one motion

  out of a lazy blue sky had plum-
meted yeepek a great bald eagle his
curved talons were already spread and
sinking into the tender back of a lit-
tle female kitten

  otan struck swiftly she leaped
high as yeepek attempted to zoom off
with that wriggling spotted shape se-
curely clamped in his talons

  otan struck through feathers to
flesh yeepek shrieked with pain and
in anger his talons opened and the
cougar kitten crashed heavily to the
rock

  swiftly otan struck again but yee-
pek had recovered poise and balance
he was dripping blood and went
zooming off to the upper craglands
there to scream his wrath and hatred
of the great tawny one below

  in spite of otans tender ministra-
tions the little spotted one died

  the struggle for the life and safety
of her young had begun for otan it
was such incidents as this that made
her a killer that roused her savagery
to a point where she became ruthless
otan knew only one code-the law of
propagation of her kind and their pro-
tection

  in all the wilderness there was no
more devoted mother than otan like-
wise there was none whose enemies
were so numerous

  now her blood burned through her
veins she quickly cached her remain-
ing kittens in the den while she stole
out to pad back and forth in a slink-
ing patrol as she gasped low throat
sounds of hatred of all creatures of
the hinterland  

another day otan stretched
on the very edge of a promontory
watching the antics of a pair of big-
horn lambs

  she licked her chops up there in
the higher levels was a good source
of food but a source well guarded

  otan lifted her gaze to include the
stout form of chag a huge ram whose
massive curved horns were a deadly
threat to all predatory hunters the
sight of them sent a shudder rippling
along otans spine twice in her ca-
reer she had been struck by the horns
of chag this old chieftain seemed
always alert his large eyes gushed
flame at the slightest sign of danger
to his ewes or their young but this
morning old chag was not in position
to see otan

  the she-cougar must have food it
was drawing close to the time when
she must teach her kittens about game
flesh and bone so far they had thrived
solely by nursing they were not yet
old enough to cut up and masticate
meat for themselves that would come
later as their teeth strengthened but
otan knew the value of green bone
for those young teeth

  she slid along a few feet with
snakelike grace watching the effect
of her stealthy movements on the big-
horn creatures above satisfied that
she had not been detected she com-
menced her sinuous stalk of death
gliding off right to a spot where the
chasm between her and the lambs was
narrower there she bunched herself
ready for the leap but suddenly her
body stiffened a fresher stronger
sheep scent assailed her nostrils

  her tail twitching otan slowly
turned her head

  down on a lower level almost di-
rectly beneath her where near a gush-
ing spring the grass was lush grazed
a lone yearling ram otan slid a moist
tongue over her chops she bellied
down catlike to watch the young
rams movements soon she knew he
would grow sluggish from his gorge
of grass


thrilling adventures

  there he was blowing now his
sides were distended and he was mak-
ing ready to flop to rest

  slowly otan rose to a crouch she
shifted on her toes making sure of
her foothold

  she was about to spring when a
clutter of loose rock on the north
slope precipitated a small slide a slide
which brought the ram snorting to
his feet out of the shadows of a
craggy cleft emerged a squat silver-
tipped shape

  otan suppressed a deep snarl as she
glimpsed the form of her greatest
enemy the newcomer was mishi a
sour-tempered old barren she-grizzly
a killer if there ever was one some-
thing had gone wrong with the
grizzlys footing to have caused that
small slide

  the young ram spun he was ready
to leap to safety when otan sprang
she struck but missed

  mishi and she-cougar met in a mad
flurry of threshing bodies two of
the most hated rivals in all the wilds
had come face to face fang to fang
talon to talon

  twice in the career of her mother-
hood otan had been forced to give
battle to mishi what mishi lacked
in weight-she was smaller than the
average of her kind-she made up for
with speed and savagery twice she
had attacked the young of otan and
otan never forgot

like a tawny flurry of savage fury
the she-cougar struck roweling
the grizzlys near flank with her tal-
ons blood gushed

  a horrible woof of anger and
pain exploded from mishis gaping
jaws with a speed belying her bulk
she whirled and charged otan rocked
back but lashed out as she coiled
with four sets of fiendish talons

  mishi was torn across one eye bel-
lowing her wrath she was forced back
and commenced to sway about otan
in a circle bloody froth flecked from
her great tusks

  again they came together but otan
was smashed back with a terrific paw
stroke to the shoulder

  from the higher levels where chag
snorted and stamped his warning to
his kindred frightened eyes popped
as they watched the grim drama be-
low chag was sending his flock leap-
ing to the higher ridges vertical
leaps which could only be emulated
by the white goat and his kind

  below with a great advantage of
weight mishi swayed back and forth
content to wait for an opening she
had one other great advantage otan
was an active mother gaunt from her
devoted care of her young her un-
derparts were tender

  but otan lacked none of her usual
fortitude time and again she threat-
ened making swift ten-foot leaps
only missing her objective mishis
squat back by a scant hair

  she bled from a gash in her right
flank the scent of her own blood
warned her of mishis speed and
power but she realized that a fight
to the death was inevitable there
was no place in this range for her-
self and mishi the plunderer

  but her young must for the time
being remain her chief thought
wisely honorably she started to
withdraw head lowered slobbering
her anger mishi followed blinking
red flame from her piggy eyes chor-
tling deep snarls as she watched the
tawny one glide backward toward the
edge of a crevasse

  otan knew of that crevasse when
sufficiently close to its edge she
would whirl and leap such was her
intention but all at once one of her
hind paws slipped over the edge she
lost her balance and in that brief split
second mishi charged

  with a smashing right blow to the
shoulder she broke otans precarious
hold on the slippery rock one stifled
scream and the tawny one spun into
space to crash heavily on the rocks
below a drop of nearly twenty-five
feet
the fangs of otan



  blackness at once engulfed otan
but quickly her brain partially cleared
she uttered a piteous throat sound
almost a hollow groan as she sagged
limply down

  above mishi swayed back and
forth woofing her calls of victory
and further challenge dimly otan
heard she stirred and stretched her
aching body to all fours but straight-
way sagged back again a sharp
spinal pain assailed her time and
again she struggled to regain her
equilibrium again and again she help-
lessly flopped back

the day dragged on and to otans
tortured mind came the thought
of her young true her kittens could
not alone make their way from the
den but there were many lurking
beasts which could gain an entrance
for example there was tarat the
wolverine and in all the wilds there
was none as ruthless as he

  such thoughts helped retrieve more
and more of otans fighting spirit

  nearby a tiny spring of icy water
gushed through a rocky fissure
slowly in great pain she dragged her
form to the water there she drank
thirstily and laved her throbbing
wounds then gallantly she dragged
herself back to the lair

  from time to time she picked up the
dread scent of mishi fierce snarls
escaped her proclaiming an even
greater hatred and as this passionate
heat of anger and hatred flushed her
bloodstream it brought her strength
one day when her kittens were suffi-
ciently strong and her own normal
strength regained otan would haunt
the trail of the silver-tip and then
there would be no mistake in her
timing

  a low meow-w-w escaped her as
she caught the faint whimpers of her
kittens she clawed her way on-on
until at last she dropped limply into
her den to nurse her ravenous brood

  for many days otan the tawny one
lay deep in her cave her throat was

parched her body burning with a ter-
rific fire save for a small quantity of
snow which had dropped down a vent
into the cave she had not touched her
tongue to water nor had she eaten
any food save the scraps of an old
cache which was buried in a deeper
recess of her lair

  more than once as she throbbed
through a night vigil she heard the
scrape of claws the claws of a ven-
turesome predatory animal outside
her cave she sniffed the nauseous
scent of tarat the wolverine who
like a slinking devil prowled just out-
side waiting-waiting until his keen
nose told him that otan had weak-
ened to a point where it would be safe
to enter and put an end to her

  but otan refused to die her body
wasted for her kittens exacted a
heavy toll as they vigorously punched
her as they greedily nursed several
times a day faithfully otan fed
them and although her efforts were
puny she also attempted their daily
ablutions

  this evening just at dusk she
pricked up her ears out of the lower
slopes had come a long defiant call
-a shrill bugle

  otan licked her chops she recog-
nized that familiar call it was the
shrill call of naiak the wild stallion
each year at this time of early spring
he led his band of shaggy mares and
their progeny to the wind- and sun-
swept slopes where they found the
first grazing naiaks movements were
as regular as those of the migratory
caribou in the far northern latitudes

  otan was stirred in all the wilder-
ness there was no flesh so succulent
as that of young horseflesh but one
other relished this flesh as much as
otan that other was mishi who
wreaked havoc with the mustang band
each spring

ow naiaks call was closer and
more challenging otan shud-
dered she knew the power of the
gray ones lightning hoofs he was


thrilling adventures

swift with his pivots and attacks
otan knew more than once he had
broken up one of her attacks on his
band once at this season of the
year he had battered to a pulp one of
otans mates

  but the calls of naiak brought new
life to otan she pushed a kitten
from her and stretched her wasted
form by sheer fortitude alone she
dragged herself to the caves opening
there she paused panting

  she sniffed the soft aromatic odors
of balsam and pine which floated down
on a gentle night wind and from
every quarter came the stirrings of
many small creatures nearby a spring
of fresh water gushed out of a fissure
to cascade musically to the lower lev-
els otans whole being burned for
want of a drink

 whimpering softly to her young
she forced herself to all fours her
limbs buckled beneath her but she
persisted and for a long moment
swayed unsteadily but upright

 now she moved forward a pace or
two her right side threatened to
give but she struggled on cautiously
carefully all at once her hair bris-
tled half turning she uttered a sav-
age snarl

  tarat the slinking killer rocked
back to coil on his back his deadly
claws lashing at empty air but otan
knew better than to attempt an attack
in her condition she advanced a fal-
tering threatening pace or two pour-
ing snarls of warning from her throat

  tarat at last withdrew cheated of
a kill he sprayed the zone with his
nauseating musk and went scamper-
ing off in his wake slunk otan
headed for the nearest water

  belly down the tawny one advanced
on the pool with the utmost stealth
ahead not only was there water but
a creature of flesh and blood

 wah a male marten was crouched
there waiting until some lesser crea-
ture came down to drink

 with the wind in her favor otan
slitted her eyes so that their glare

would not give her away but now
she was forced to practice all her
stealth she was in no condition for
one of her long accurate death leaps
she was obliged to steal in to within
a yard or so of the marten and then
she must be deadly accurate for wah
was one of the swiftest creatures of
the whole hinterland slowly scarcely
breathing the cougar moved forward
a few inches at a time her gaunt sin-
uous form writhing like that of a
python

 wah stirred he cocked his head
sharply turning his snakelike neck
searching for warning scents sud-
denly he made a sharp clacking noise
with his teeth otans nerve fibres re-
acted she knew that wahs prey was
approaching-some small creature
which would arrest the martens full
attention

 she watched him stretch his neck
forward toward a dark narrow cleft
it was her cue she moved in and
suddenly laced out with a lightning-
like stroke of a forepaw

 wah was pinned he shrilled a
sharp cry of pain and swiftly coiled
his neck about as otan struck down
with her fangs

two sharp needle points impaled
the cougars tender nose for his
size wahs jaws were powerful he
clamped on a terrific hold in his ex-
tremity

 otan gurgled a rasping snarl and
with her free forepaw went into ac-
tion with a fierce one-way slash of
her fierce claws wah was disembow-
eled for the first time in many days
otan tasted fresh blood but water
was her first thought she laid the
dead marten to one side until she had
quenched her thirst and laved her
burning body so that the incessant
throbbing ceased then turning she
crunched soft bone and flesh and
quickly there was no scrap left save
a small tuft of hair

  as she moved on back to her lair
otan paused her nose wrinkling with
the fangs of otan



a great pleasure for the night wind
in a fickle change had brought her
the scent of naiak and his kindred

  but all at once the tawny one stif-
fened mingled with that horse scent
was the dread scent of mishi the sil-
ver-tip

  otans lips peeled back her soft
whispers turned to long caterwauling
screams of rage almost before naiak
and his band had become established
at the lower plateau mishi would
scatter them perhaps driving them off
entirely

  for upward of two hours otan
stood poised on the very edge of her
rimrock listening sniffing and with
each sound and scent from below
there came to her a new strength

  from below came a sudden stamped-
ing sound of drumming hoofs the
hated scent of mishi again and then
a long grim silence otans form
twitched and rippled with a consum-
ing anger soon she would have to
meet that silver-tipped plunderer but
not until she had regained full
strength not until her kittens were
able to move swiftly and accurately

  otan padded back to the lair and
for the first time since her battering
and fall she slept long and soundly
awakening only when with the com-
ing of a new day the kittens vora-
ciously demanded their dawn feed 

  spring came with its riot of sound
and full color first a whirring rush
of bird life

  otan had not recovered quickly
from her fight with mishi festering
claw wounds had bothered her mak-
ing her nervous about venturing from
the lair zone in the great wisdom of
her motherhood she had contented
herself with hunting only small bird
and rodent life

  now she listened to the gabble of
newly arrived waterfowl on a nearby
creek from a distant lake came the
long eerie ghostlike wail of moakwa
the loon sentinel a call which was
caught and flung back in weird echoes
by the foothills

  day followed night in regular se-
quence otan continued to build up
her strength while her young grew
swiftly to a point where now they
demanded meat it was not however
until near the end of june that otan
felt strong enough to venture forth
in search of a big kill

  for many long hours that first day
out she had scouted the hills for sign
of a nomadic bighorn but these
mountain sheep were the crafty ones
well guarded by the old rams and
ewes whose watchful eyes were hawk-
like

but there was in spite of this
vigilance always a wanderer-
usually a venturesome young ram
who flushed with the first yearnings
of his growth had shifted off in quest
of a mate it was such a youngster
that otan now stalked as the first
purpled grays of dusk softly draped
the heights

  otan lay belly down in a shallow
draw sniffing strong scent of sheep
this was a spot recently evacuated
by a small band of ewes above her
a young ram was making methodical
vertical drops from ledge to ledge

  as he reached the bottom of the
draw the youngster snorted his con-
tempt and disgust he commenced to
paw at the mossy turf shaking his
head and immature horns he pro-
claimed a fierce passionate anger

  slowly a semblance of composure
returned and he minced off toward
the small waterhole nothing more
than a spongy seepage there he blew
into the soggy moss before starting to
slake his thirst by sucking the water
through grass and moss

  like a bolt of forked lightning
otan sprang her timing was un-
erring she landed squarely along the
back of her prey but the youngster
was strong for a moment he held up
her weight whirling in an attempt
to throw her clear but otan was not
to be cheated of this kill her terrible
fangs were cutting their way down


thrilling adventures

through his hair and tallow to the
spinal cord

  from a nearby scrub pine old ah-
hoo the great horned owl denizen
poured out his deep eerie wail of
death the ram suddenly burbled a
rattling throat sound and slumped
limp and lifeless to the turf

  swift as a rapier thrust otan
tapped the rams jugular and drank
eagerly of warm fresh blood

  for a long moment when her desire
for blood had at last been sated she
padded about her kill voicing low
throat sounds-the proclamation of
possession then suddenly she leaped
away and bounded to her lair

  one by one in her mouth she car-
ried her kittens to the kill careful
each time to make sure there was no
plunderer nearby

  she chewed from the sheep carcass
a slab of mutton this she tossed to
the young and while she herself
fed she listened to the snarls of the
kittens as they had a tug-of-war with
their first fresh meat

  they were unable to do more than
worry off small fragments of mutton
but this had been their first lesson
at a kill from now on their educa-
tion would be extended otan would
even lead them short distances al-
lowing them to watch as she struck
down some lesser hinterland creature
they would learn the value of quiet
of discretion and patience   

  late september brought the first
frosts when the hinterland was
quickly changed from a place of vary-
ing greens to a riot of multi-tinted
foliage and mosses

  otans young were now more than
half grown-two sleek youngsters
now able to accompany her down to
the low rangeland draws it was here
she searched for fresh sign of naiak
and his band but she was soon aware
of the fact that the horse creatures
had left by now they were far to the
south in the meadow flats where the
wild mint flavored the lush succulent
grasses

  today otans young trailed her
as she stole up on the tracks of a
young spike mule-deer buck for two
miles she patiently loped or trotted
on in the deers wake now and then
having to back-track to cuff her
young which were often intrigued by
soft stirrings in the thickets they
were flushed with the urge to hunt out
a rabbit or grouse for themselves

  now otan came to a sharp halt in
a scant poplar glade it was here that
utik the buck had stopped dead in
his tracks he stood quivering in
every limb every muscle as though
instinctively scenting danger yet not
knowing exactly where to locate it

  otans every nerve fiber grew sud-
denly taut she too was all at once
aware of a menace her nose wrinkled
and she peeled back her lips

  one of her young ones whimpered
-a scarcely audible note yet one
heard by utik the buck his great
ears pricked sharply up and forward
and he snorted wildly

  otan shifted on her toes testing her
footing before she leaped fully
tensed and set her body rippled a
brief moment then like an arrow she
sprang

  utik buckled at the knees he was
down with the first smashing impact
of the cougar attack he recovered
and attempted to run but only stum-
bled a few paces when suddenly all
was black otans fangs had done
their grim work

  quickly the cougar whirled to cut
the jugular when a warning scream
reached her she whirled a hideous
half-snarl half-scream escaping her as
she glimpsed the terrible form of
mishi the silver-tip

  mishis great jaws were closing on
the back of a kitten mishi had am-
bled along against the wind scenting
both the odor of utik and the scent
of the cougar family

  otan issued a strange sound for one
of her kind-a sound of piteous ap-
peal and yet it registered only her
burning anger
the fangs of otan



  at otans charge mishi flung her
massive head tossing the dead young
cougar from her her tusks were drip-
ping red slaver as she rushed to meet
otans attack grizzly and she-cougar
went down together in a rolling mass
of furry hellishness fangs and talons
lanced and slashed in a mad fury of
the devils designing

  at last otans claws found an open-
ing she struck savagely downward
with her left rear paw opening a ter-
rible gash along mishis belly

  with a bellow of pain and rage
mishi relinquished a tusk hold on one
of the cougars forepaws she whirled
away a grotesque bleeding shape

  back at a discreet distance crouched
young yik otans sole remaining
youngster yik had always been the
most vigorous of her brood he had
always demanded-and got-the big-
gest share of the food from the first
day of his birth yik by his own
power had already killed a wood-
chuck and two squirrels

for a long moment he shuddered
and whimpered with a great fear
but now as he watched his mother
whirl again to attack a new feeling
manifested itself it was an instinc-
tive fighting courage-the heritage of
his great sire a male of over two-
hundred-and-forty pounds weight

  shaking the last vestige of his early
fear from him yik although little
more than half grown stretched him-
self his tail began to twitch he
began to circle back crouching every
so often to watch the progress of the
battle

  now he watched mishi whirl like
lightning on her haunches to smash
a battering blow to otans near shoul-
der otan was down but quickly she
coiled as mishi charged first her
left and then her right paw raked the
big ones jowls bringing more gouts
of blood

  piggy eyes flashing mishi backed
off a pace or two shoulders well
humped her huge head swaying she

  mouthed her anger and hatred she
was giving her entire attention to the
bellied-down shape of the tawny one
otan

  otan knew the value of playing pos-
sum feigning semi-helplessness she
was gasping her sides bellowing as
though almost completely winded
but although her slitted eyes seemed
to be focused directly on mishi otan
was looking beyond to that sleek
slinking shape of young yik

  otan wanted to call a warning but
she realized that it might be fatal to
her son yik was bunching otan
stirred as she watched him shift from
one set of toes to the other as he had
seen her do as instinctively he tested
his footing

  as his back undulated in a ripple of
movement otan half rose this slight
move on her part brought immediate
action from the silver-tip head down
mishi was ready to strike

  in that moment yik leaped this
was his first death leap and his tim-
ing was excellent

  mishi reared bellowing her wrath
shocked by the surprise rear attack
she was however only momentarily
thrown into a near panic as she
reared she whirled in an effort to dis-
lodge that cougar shape but yik had
a deep claw hold and steadily he was
chewing his way through that thick
mass of grizzly hair

  he was not mature enough to effect
a kill but he had given otan a respite
a chance

  the she-cougar rushed but was met
by two lightning forepaw smashes
fortunately for otan she was ready
and took only part of the force of
those blows she took them going
away in a graceful sideward flirt of
her lithe form

  again and again she rushed the
silver-tip hoping to hold mishi on
her hindquarters trying to keep her
from flopping to her back when yik
wouldnt have a chance beneath that
five-hundred-pound bulk time and
again she threatened the old she-bear


thrilling adventures

had otan been in yiks position
mishis last breath would long since
have left her great body

  it was fear for her son that held
otan she had taken a savage batter-
ing from those forepaws now she
knew that there was only one move
left to mishi she waited for that
sudden backward drop

it came with a wild woof as
she felt those immature fangs at
last find a danger spot near her spinal
cord mishi went over backward but
like a flash otan was in at her throat
mishi was forced to roll before her
weight could possibly crush out the
life of yik

  in a mad flurry mishi lashed out
with her massive forearms pounding
clawing battering

 otan sprang clear she called
swiftly to young yik who unhurt
save for a bruise or two leaped to
safety the young one slunk care-
fully to his mothers side and re-
ceived a flick of her warm tongue
while mishi swayed back and forth
on her broad pads whipping herself
into a frothy temper as she bled pro-
fusely from many claw wounds over
her body

  it was now that otan realized she
must practice all the instinctive wiles
of her sex mishi was too great an
adversary for her in open battle but
mishi must go

  small creatures of the wilderness
were drawing in close attracted by
the strong scents of the kills and of
fresh blood of the belligerents into
the gathering dusk came the gleam of
many sets of inquisitive eyes

  otan suddenly called sharply to
yik a cry which sent him bounding
off toward the hill country she half
turned and commenced to stagger
away she seemed to drag along a
helpless hindquarter

  mishi raised her bulk to her hind
paws and commenced to flail the
empty air grandiosely proclaiming a
victory to her the fight was won

there remained only the coup de
grace and that would shortly come

  head down she commenced to trail
the dragging she-cougar

  otan moved sluggishly along up
one slope and then another getting
deeper and deeper into the forbidding
shadows yik was nowhere in sight

  mishi came to a sudden halt there
was no further sign of the tawny one
otan had mysteriously vanished from
the ledge rock trail the she-grizzly
snarled and continued on in the trail
of yik a trail which followed a tor-
tuous shelf of rock

  again the silver-tip halted to sniff
sharply

  above on the next rock level
crouched otan like many another
wilderness mother in a crisis she had
simulated helplessness to good pur-
pose with grim design her eyes
gleamed fiercely as she watched the
swaying movement of that hulking
menace below now like a shot she
sprang

  a bellowed woof boomed from
mishis throat as otans weight
crashed to her back she reared and
attempted to whirl so that she could
crush that clinging shape against the
sheer wall but there was no room
for such maneuver

  no longer was there a set of puny
immature fangs and claws at her back
and neck but cutters which were
swiftly sinking to a death stroke

  there was but one move left to
mishi-a suicidal move an outward
leap which would take her and that
clinging cougar shape down to certain
death together

  but otan was prepared as her
fangs struck the great spinal cord and
mishi whirled to leap otans agile
form flung off the she-bears lacerated
back

mishi toppled backward and tum-
bled in a grotesque mass to
death on the jagged rocks nearly fifty
feet below but otan dropped not too
heavily onto a slab of rock not more
the fangs of otan



than ten feet down she was unin-
jured in the fall

  for a long moment she listened for
sign of life from that pulped mass
beneath her then slowly cautiously
she began a skillful descent of the
cragland

  at the death site otan sniffed
sharply at the dead form of her most
hated rival no longer would there
be anything to fear from the smash-
ing paws and terrible tusks of the
silver-tip she-bear

  otan leaped to a large boulder and
poured out a call to yik she called
again and again until at last his an-
swer reached her shrill and clear in
the night air

  in a few moments he was down at her
flank muzzling her running his sleek
young shape the full length of hers
making soft throaty sounds of pleas-
ure

  together they moved back toward
the poplar glade where utik the buck
lay stiff and stark as they neared the
kill otan leaped forward snarling
fiercely she scattered a half score of
small rodents and creatures filled with
blood lust

  circling the buck a time or two
listening for sign of any greater men-
ace she at last whimpered to yik
who bounded forward swiftly the
she-cougar clawed out a large slab of
warm flesh for yik she tossed this
back to him and whispered a husky
gasp of contentment as she heard his
young fangs slosh into its succulence
then and only then did she begin
her own feast

  otan and her son ate their fill
young yik wanted to slink away to
the thicket and lie down so full was
his greedy belly but there was an-
other lesson to be learned otan in-
structed him in the art of burying or
concealing the remains of the deer
carcass-a cache of food for another
meal it was routine work for the she-
cougar albeit other lesser or even
greater animals might find and clean
up the carcass in the meantime

  satisfied gasping her complete con-
tentment otan at last called to her
son and led him back to the lair where
as the grim wilderness throbbed
throughout another night of many
tragedies she and yik slept a long
sound sleep

amundsen

 by charles s strong

   explorer traveler and historian-author of campbell of the
   black watch washingtons first railroad etc

a year ago a young irishman
set the world by the ears
 when he started in a plane for
los angeles and landed in ireland-

amundsen in outfit employed for bis
dash to the south pole

wrong-way corrigan they called
him

  twenty-eight years ago a young
norwegian performed a feat of cir-
cumambulation that makes corrigans
flight of something over twenty-five
hundred miles in the wrong direction
look like a week-end picnic drive
along a flowery parkway-non-stop
amundsen he could well be called
he headed for the north pole and
ended up by discovering the south
pole-and never even stopped for
water

  but there was this fine distinction
between the two exploits amundsen
deliberately went in the direction op-
posite that for which he started he
admitted it explaining that there was
method in the madness that landed
him at the bottom of the world when
he had started for the top

  the events leading up to that mo-
mentous episode of over a quarter of
a century ago began in the norwegian
sea off the west coast of norway be-
tween that half of the scandinavian

the latest in a new
series of thrilling
adventures from the
pages of history
a lion of the north heads south and

peninsula and iceland a steamer
with white smoke wreaths billowing
above it lifted to the rise and fall of
the dark green waves of the icy
treacherous sea

  striding its deck was captain roald
amundsen the intrepid norwegian
explorer who already had made a name
for himself that was envied by land-
lubbers who only read of his exploits
on the bounding main and in the icy
wastes of the arctic for already he
had spent four years in the polar re-
gions of snow and ice and darkness
of glittering arctic lights with the
six men who had earlier been his com-
panions aboard the small sealing ves-
sel gjoa

  during the course of the gjoa ex-
pedition amundsen had journeyed
from christiania now oslo norway
on june   and ultimately ar-
rived in the bering sea off the
alaskan coast of north america on
july   the world had hailed
him as the gjoas commander and the
small sealer itself as the first craft to
journey from ocean to ocean north
of patagonia

in nansens wake

  back in norway finally amundsen
made preparation to return to north-
ern canadian waters this time better
equipped he organized a new expedi-
tion to set out aboard the world-
famous vessel fram adventure was
in the very name of the ship on which
he now sailed for the fram was the
well-known polar ship in which
fridtjof nansen and otto sverdrup
had made the great historical drift
through the north polar regions
seventeen years before in 

  the fram was particularly adapted
for amundsens requirements be-
cause of its peculiar construction
when the exploring vessel was built
nansen had planned so that it would

roald amundsen

be ice resisting to that end the hull
had been built so that the ship would
be lifted up on top of the floes when
ice formed instead of being crushed
between them

  nansen had been inordinately proud
of that exploration vessel even when
he had temporarily given up explor-
ing and had retired to his home in
christiania he ever held a soft spot
in his heart for the fram his villa
overlooked the waterfront because he
always got a big kick out of seeing
the lifeblood of norways commerce
and the ships of the countrys explor-
ers moving in and out

 it was from the windows of his
home that he watched the fram put
out to sea with captain roald
amundsen on her deck and captain
amundsens eyes set ahead for the
frozen northern wastes beyond ice-
landic waters fridtjof nansen
would have given a great deal
amundsen himself later told me to
have been a member of that explora-
tion party of 


thrilling adventures

a change in plans

  it was off the coast of scotland
when the fram dropped anchor before
starting on the long journey across
the atlantic and arctic oceans that
exciting news reached the expedition
it was news that instantly changed
the plans of the young hardy de-
termined commander-and changed
some potential pages of history as
well as the course of the lives of many
courageous men

 that news was that captain r f
scott had departed from england for
the south pole to carry on his own
explorations and those of another
englishman ernest shackleton news
had already reached norway of the
discovery of the north pole during
the previous spring by commander
robert e peary of the united states

 the rugged-jawed amundsen called
his crew about him

  peary has beaten us to the north
pole he said and scott is heading

southward which way do we head
the eyes of the scandinavians who
made up the majority of his crew
brightened at the prospect of a dash
for the south pole in friendly competi-
tion with their english rivals there
was scarcely need to question what
their decision would be

  captain amundsen straightened
head up eyes seeing across the thou-
sands of miles of icy and of tropic
seas

 the fram goes southward he
said we will race captain scott to
the south pole

  and with that weighty snap de-
cision began one of the longest
wrong-way non-stop journeys in ex-
ploration history

 captain amundsen changed his
course and the expedition whose
members as well as those who had
wished them god-speed had believed
them heading for the comparatively
near north polar regions turned its

area on shores of bergensfjord to be occupied by the
international exhibition of polar exploration

  roald amundsens sudden deter-
mination to head for the south pole
instead of the north pole in order to
be the first one there might have
seemed a foolhardy venture to some
but they would not have known the
man

  in any exploration venture roald
amundsen was always careful of his

men-and of himself besides the
antarctic was not entirely unfamiliar
to him he had served as first mate
under captain adrien de gerlache
organizer and leader of the belgian
expedition to the south pole in
- the belgica expedition craft
of the gerlache party reached
seventy-one degrees thirty minutes
south and while this was no record
at the time they did make valuable
scientific discoveries

 amundsen was determined now
though that the frams exploration
party should reach the south pole it-
self

  nothing less would satisfy either
him or his men

  naturally since communication was

thrilling adventures

  not nearly so advanced as it is now
  captain scott knew nothing of
  amundsens abrupt plan to compete
  with him for the glory of discovery
  the last he had heard before sailing
  from england was that amundsen
  was on his way to the north of canada
  probably to explore around king
  william land and the arctic islands
  thereabouts

the race is on

    on his arrival in antarctic waters
  aboard the terra nova captain scott
  ordered anchor dropped on the west
  side of ross island between the win-
  ter quarters he had established on a
  previous visit in the discovery from
   to  and cape royd the
  terra nova carried a capable crew
  and aboard was also an extensive
  scientific staff as aides to scott

    the ross ice shelf with its green-
  ish-blue cliffs and its crackling bar-
  rier ice formed a formidable back-
  drop but to the intrepid explorers
  this was only a part of the adventure

    landing parties were organized im-
  mediately captain scott divided the
  members of his expedition into two
  parts one went ashore with scott
  himself in charge while lieutenant
  campbell with a skeleton crew of six
  men was detailed to sail the terra
  nova eastward down along the line
  of mountains that extend toward the
  part of the antarctic continent below
  new zealand and establish a base on
  king edward land the terra nova
  was skirting in and out of coves on a
  survey expedition while en route
  when the norwegian ship fram was
  discovered in one of the bays

    it was the surprise of a lifetime for
  lieutenant campbell and his crew
  and the young lieutenant expressed
  that when he and his crew went
  aboard the norwegian vessel with
  twinkling eyes amundsen made for-
  mal inquiry about scott and his party
  -but englishmen and norwegians
  alike knew one indisputable fact
  though no word of it was spoken

a

  the race for the pole was oni
both the amundsen and scott par-
ties camped on the edge of the rosa
ice barrier amundsen ordered the
fram to buenos aires to remain
there for the winter scott sent the
terra nova to the winter base at
cape adare just inside the antarctic
circle

         different methods
british and norwegian commanders
each had definite ideas about the best
methods to be employed in the forth-
coming attempt at conquest of the ice-
bound south pole and it was the
difference in these methods that even-
tually was the difference between suc-
cess and failure

  scotts polar party started from
cape evans on october   in
three groups to act independently of
each other with the expectation that
at least one party would get through
one group headed into the bitter sub-
zero temperatures on motor-sledges
another rode shaggy ponies inured to
cold and the third carried its duffle on
dog sledges

  captain amundsen hardy norse-
man that he was followed an entirely
different procedure captain scott
had reached the barrier ahead of him
and the british expedition was more
highly organized and better equipped
but that the norwegians grimly de-
termined should prove no handicap
for them

  they went about their preparations
for their dash to the pole with delib-
eration carefully they cached their
supplies parceling out what was
deemed necessary for each mans re-
quirements during the trek these
supplies were carried by the fifty-two
dogs they had brought along when at
last they were set to go-four days be-
fore captain scott left his base

  there were no motor-sledges no
ponies instead when the members

ration party set out each man was on
skis-the traditional method of win-
ter locomotion in norway a much
smaller party than scotts also for
there were only four men besides the
determined leader

  they cut inland around the ross
shelf ice and moved across one side
of queen mauds range until they
reached the axel heiberg glacier at
eighty-five degrees south latitude
here amundsen and his men scaled
the glacier and pointed for the pole
moving steadily along their goal was
in sight-was reached-on december
 

  as casually as though he had merely
reached a proposed picnic spot
amundsen erected a tent and spent
the next three days at the pole that
he was certain should satisfy anyone
of his claim to squatter rights for
norway on the southernmost tip of
the earth satisfied himself then
and well rested he and his four men
set out on the return trip to the coast
-a trip that took only five weeks
and when he arrived he still had
twelve dogs left and ample food sup-
plies for some time more in the frozen
wastes

scott against odds

  in the meantime the members of
scotts three divisions of explorers
had known a heartbreaking six weeks
after they had turned their eyes to-
ward the same goal the motor-sledge
expedition bogged down almost be-
fore it got started the last of the
ponies was shot when the expedition
had pushed well up into the shadow
of mount markham at eighty-three
degrees thirty minutes south

  it was here that the mournful real-
ization came to the fagged adventur-
ers that it would also be best to send
the dog teams back

  well make it though-weve got
to captain scott insisted with jaws
set tight and teeth gritted in deter-
mination we have not come this far
only to fail weve only six and a half

degrees to go before we reach the
pole weve got to get there

  and he tried-tried courageously
and heartbreakingly - with eleven
members of his original party and
three hand-drawn sledges eleven
because others disheartened by their
grueling experience in the bitterness
of this antarctic december had al-
ready turned back

  desperate as they were all becom-
ing though the spirits of the scat-
tered remnants of the scott expedi-
tion lifted when on the morning of
december  they reached the foot of
the beardmore glacier a natural path-
way to the pole clear sailing now
it looked-and not much further

too late

  unaware that roald amundsen had
already reached the pole scotts
party plodded ahead through the
wind-blown ice particles and over
the frozen surface of the beardmore
glacier on december  four mem-
bers of the party with one of the
sledges were sent back after having
reached eighty-five degrees seven
minutes south latitude the rest
moved ahead for another ten days
when finally supplies began running
so low that with sinking spirits once
more scott realized there would not
be enough to keep alive even the small
group of men left with him

  therefore when they had reached
eighty-six degrees fifty-six minutes
a little more than three degrees from
the pole lieutenant e r g r evans
turned back with two of his compan-
ions they had already suffered un-
told hardships and before they fin-
ished the terrific trip back to the coast
they almost died of scurvy brought
on by malnutrition

  remaining with scott were captain
oates petty-officer edgar evans dr

with one sledge and equipment origi-
nally designed for four men they
pushed ahead they reached the pole

thrilling adventures

sires for which they had suffered
agonies-on january   a month
after amundsens departure

  but even before they put foot on
the spot that is the southernmost ex-
tremity of the worlds axis they knew
they were too late amundsen had
been there before them amundsen
had left proof

antarctic tragedy

  dully they gazed at the tent flying
the flag of norway in this wild cold
spot so far from the world they knew
a sight so incongruous here and their
hearts sank below the sub-zero of the
air they breathed too late the
norwegian had won this tent of his
the records of discovery he had left
were proof positive for eighty-seven
days they had been searching for this
historic spot-only to be forestalled
by amundsen and his valiant norse-
men

  even this distressing disappoint-
ment however was not the last bur-
den that scott and his party had to
bear they encountered bad weather
on the way back one disaster after
another befell the party petty-officer
edgar evans collapsed on the beard-
more glacier after one days weary
march shoreward and died on febru-
ary   captain oates shortly
afterward found himself at the end of
his strength and not wishing to be a
burden to the other suffering mem-
bers of the party crawled away from
the tent unseen one night staggered
to his feet and plunged off into the
blizzard he was never heard from
after that grim st patricks day
march  

  the three survivors heroically
struggled on for another ten miles
and finally pitched their tent halfway
between two supply bases the next
morning when they were preparing
to go on they were hemmed in by a
blizzard that raged over the antarctic
ice cap for nine days it was the end
for scott and the two men who had
fought to a desperately bitter finish

they did not have the strength to go
on   

amundsens greatest regret

  knowing nothing whatever of the
trials that were befalling his friendly
rival amundsen completed his work
on the ice barrier awaited the return
of the fram from buenos aires and
sailed for norway in the spring of
 arriving home early in  not
until then did he know that the scott
expedition had not been heard from-
and no one better than he who knew
the terrors of that icy antarctic land
could guess what had befallen it in
that merciless land

  later events proved his surmise
correct search parties were sent out
during the summer and fall of 
but it was not until november 
 that a party under the leadership
of dr atkinson finally stumbled upon
the tent located the frozen bodies
and found the record of their last har-
rowing experiences during the grim
blizzard

 i met roald amundsen several
times in oslo bergen and spitsber-
gen he spoke often of the north
pole expedition that went to the
south pole and one of the bitter
regrets of his life was that he had not
known of scotts distress so that he
could have gone to his aid he would
have gone too if it had meant his own
life for in roald amundsen was the
stuff of which heroes are made the
self-sacrificing instinct that makes a
man lay down hib life not only for a
friend but for any human being who
is a victim of adversity

  in the end he did give his life-
gladly-for another man when he set
out to search for general umberto
nobile commander of the ill-fated
dirigible italia no one who was in
norway at that time as i was will
ever forget the despair over the loss
of this hero for the amundsen res-
cue expedition was lost in the arctic
-and roald amundsen never came
back

the pxide of norway

  norway is proud not only of its
own arctic and antarctic heroes but
also pays homage to the heroes of all
lands the monument to captain
robert scott on one of the heights on
the mountain railway route between
bergen and oslo is testimony to that
the country has been host to ells-
worth byrd sir hubert wilkins and
many other english american and
european explorers who have gone
into the ice-covered regions the
norwegians made them heartily wel-
come and sent them on their way with
fervent god-speeds

  during a dinner at the waldorf
astoria hotel on his visit to the
united states at which i was a guest
crown prince olav called my atten-
tion to the fact that besides his pres-
ent activity in connection with the
norwegian pavilion at the new york
worlds fair he is also serving as
honorary president of the interna-
tional exhibition of polar explora-
tion to be held at bergen norway in


  curiosity and a deep interest in
this subject prompted me to go fur-
ther into this matter i discovered
that many interesting plans are being
made for this festival to commemorate
the activities of nansen amundsen
sverdrup scott shackleton byrd
weddell balchen bennett and all
those other famous and even the little
known men who have pushed the
frontiers of the world to the north-
ward and to the southward despite
adversities

a triple feature

  the committee organized in 
has spent the past three years com-
pleting plans and has finally assem-
bled a triple feature that will encom-
pass most of the modern knowledge
concerning the polar regions the
exploration section will include three
sub-divisions

a	voyages of exploration charts show-
  ing routes of expeditions models of

  vessels airships and airplanes instru-
  ments equipment clothing tents charts
  etc diaries photographs original and
  printed charts

b	permanent stations meteorological and
  other bases maps showing the position
  of stations photographs and informa-
  tion about the stations activities and
  their personnel

c	special scientific studies

  a second sectioi will be devoted to
presentation of natural conditions in
the areas such as the arctic ocean
greenland jan mayen land spits-
bergen franz josef land novaya
zemlya the arctic archipelagoes of
asia and america the asiatic and
american mainlands bordering on the
arctic ocean and the antarctic con-
tinent with its surrounding seas and
islands

  the third division will be in two
sections under the general heading of
inhabitants of the polar regions
they will be

p the peoples of the polar regions
  archeological and ethnographical mate-
  rial charts and diagrams showing den-
  sity of population as well as civilizing
  efforts and economic and hygienic prog-
  ress among the arctic peoples

b	the economi exploitation of the polar
  regions by civilized man including
  whaling sealing trapping fishing in-
  dustrial development communications
  tourist traffic and administration

  the exhibitions grounds located
along bergens waterfront will
cover an area of thirty or more acres
and will be accessible to visitors by
steamer railway airplane and car it
will run from may to september


  here indeed will be a wealth
of arctic and antarctic treasure
gathered at the expense of the live of
real heroes at the ready disposal now
of anyone who loves the breath of ad-
venture

own camp beside the bundles of bag-
gage two cargadores or porters were
curled like cats a little farther from
the fire two other men lay steve
govern and a native named nicanor
alvaro

  logan stepped lightly past the fire
and touched govern on the leg the
big white mans unshaved face was
churlish in repose and he threw out
an arm fretfully against his tormentor

logan wished he did not have
govern and that ugly native al-
varo on his hands he had encoun-
tered them that afternoon lost-or so
they said govern was a scout for a
rubber company and had come into
central mindanao searching for plan-
tation sites he and his native helper
had been traveling in circles in the
jungle an altogether possible story
yet-

  govern came abruptly awake his
lips curled in a snarl

  whata you want

  logan would like to have told him
to jump in the pulangi but he spoke
calmly

  there may be a little trouble you
better get ready got a gun with
you

  govern snapped erect

 gun hell no the damn con-
stabulary in malabang wouldnt let
me carry one whata you mean
trouble 

  alvaro rose to a squat his dark
face with the coal-black hair above it
looked like an apes in the firelight
logan would not have trusted him as

a guide or anything else but he was a
fit partner for govern

  logan barked orders to the carga-
dores to pile wood on the fire pena
the other constabulary soldier had
already slipped to the far side of the
camp and crouched listening

  a heavy hand fell on logans shoul-
der and swung him around steve
governs glowering face was inches
from his own

  dont build up the fire you fool
youll draw them damn bolo slingers
right on us

  logan struck down the hand and
have no light to sight a rifle dark-
ness is just what those barong men
want

  i say take to the brush-scatter-

  listen buddy logans voice was
hard and cold if youve got no use
for your head just try that indas
men would slice your head loose in
five minutes

  augusto suddenly whipped up his
rifle and called a sharp command his
springfield spat with startling vehe-
mence a scream went up from the
blackness of the mountainside

  then hell exploded about the camp

  the rustling of brush was like the
downwhip of a mountain blast a ter-
rific a-ah-e-e the moro battle call
tore through the luan trees shifting
bare-torsoed men leaped into the outer
circle of light reflected flames ran
like runnels of molten metal along
bare blades

  penas rifle opened with a throaty
roar augusto fired again and a plung-
ing moro wilted in midair the two
cargadores threw themselves flat bab-
bling

  logans voice rose above the hub-
bub

 back pena-augusto make a
close circle around the fire make
every shot count

  his own automatic was spitting he
saw one jerking dervish of a fellow go
down then another the on-plunging
moros scattered and fell back he
caught another rag-turbaned moro be-
knives of the jungle



low the shoulder and saw him knocked
flat by the slug as he took more flash
shots at the shifting figures pena
raced back and squatted back toward
the captain his rifle clearing the brush
on that side with augusto to close
in the circle they could give these
devils the bellyful they asked for

a scream lifted from the left
logan whirled to see three kris-
men close upon augusto as he re-
treated the constabulary soldier
dropped one not two yards in front of
the springfield then swung his empty
rifle like a flail

  watch close pena logan yelled
and leaped toward augusto

  one of the attackers faced the on-
coming officer drew back his arm
logan let him have it without taking
time to aim the wavy blade of a kris
flashed above logans head

 for one stilling instant logans
blood went cold at the sight of bare
steel-then he was plunging down-
ward

  the blade went over his shoulder
carried by its own weight something
gnawed at the heel of logans boot
he was in a welter of arms and legs
a gloating cry lifted he swept his
assailant clear and half rose his auto-
matic had been knocked from his
hand his hat was gone a ring of
krismen was closing like hunters on
the kill half turned he saw augusto
go down his rifle slithering out in
front of him

 logans fingers closed upon the
barrel of the springfield with one
hand he swept it about him even be-
fore he rose and heard the crunch of
wood on bone then he was on his
feet beating at the ghoulish faces
from far away it seemed penas rifle
kept up an intermittent fire

  logan struck down the nearest head
wondering what had become of steve
govern he felt the responsibility of
letting an american-an unarmed one
-fall beneath the knives of indas
devils

 they were pressing on phil logan
now like terriers on a wolfhound rag
turbans were bobbing barongs flash-
ing he struck and struck again at
the circle of dark visages

  his breath was a fire in his throat
his lungs were tightening as if
pressed by iron bands the stock of
the rifle was nicked and splintered by
blades he swept it about him again
and again as despair crept into his
brain

  slowly irresistibly captain phil
logan was shoved back inch by inch
yard by yard he was forced farther
from the fire the half-wrecked
springfield was growing heavy in his
hands

 brush broke away behind him
across those turbaned heads the fire
was no longer visible only the star-
light and the shifting movements of
his assailants he gave one more full-
armed blow stepped back and the
earth dropped from beneath his foot

  he seemed to totter on the brink of
nothingness in that second of waver-
ing balance the fact shot home to him
that the barking of penas springfield
was stilled they must have got him

  a lean corded hand seized the stock
of the rifle as logan unbalanced
aimed one last futile blow the ring
of gaping faces was like a cordon of
gargoyles he was dropping falling

 one wild thought split the amer-
ican captains mind was this the end
no pain-just falling falling

  he struck heavily seemed to pause
on a shelving grade and then rolled
on the mountainside tore loose all
about him he heard the tear and
grind of caving earth and rock as
half buried he was carried along in an
avalanche of falling earth

  a stone leaped from the pitch dark-
ness to meet him and after that total
blackness and quiet   

captain phil logan groped
his way back to consciousness
with a splitting head his body was
enveloped in tons of weight he could


thrilling adventures

not move his legs and pain racked
every muscle

  if the darkness of the mountainside
had been dense before it was an im-
penetrable pit now he tried to turn
his head but everywhere that oppres-
sive inkiness baffled him it took min-
utes to realize that he was half buried
in stones and dirt with his left arm
all of his body that was free he began
to shove away the fallen mass

 with each movement pain lifted
scaldingly from the calves of his legs
yet action alone brought clarity to his
throbbing head

 he did not know how long he had
been out an ominous silence hung
everywhere yet he could not be a hun-
dred yards from the mountain camp
had the murderous hillmen left why
hadnt they finished him while he lay
helpless what had happened to the
others 

  his right arm was free now and he
sat up with a last effort he pulled his
legs free above the stars gleamed in
a narrowed circle but walls of black-
ness hemmed him in

  he hobbled forward only to run into
the sheer smooth wall of a cliff this
must be the bank down which he had
stumbled he began to move to the
left feeling along the vertical wall
stumbling over boulders and accumu-
lated detritus brush tore at him at
times he could mount for several
yards but always the straight cliff
reared up to block him like a prison
wall

 panic came to logan he stumbled
on regardless of the pain in his legs
hot physical combat man against
man he could understand but to be
a rat in an unknown well was differ-
ent

  action was the only remedy for his
shaken nerves always his right hand
felt along that wall his feet stumbling
on a path he could not see one hour
two hours-his time sense refused to
function-and he was again at the
droppings of the avalanche where he
had dug free

  he had made the circuit of the val-
ley and there was no ascent

  a hot imprecation rose to his lips
no wonder the hill krismen had not
followed him he had heard of these
sunken valleys age-old craters rem-
nants of the era when volcanic forces
had lifted the mountains of mindanao
but to be imprisoned alive in one-

  somewhere over on the pulangi
lieutenant mata waited for a man
who could lead the war against inda
and old inda the mountain fox had
hamstrung his enemies by removing
captain phil logan

chapter ii

shoulder bars

dawn crept to-
ward the zenith in a
slow sheet of gray
blanking the stars
logan waited with
an impatience that
was galling the
night hum of the
jungle the chorus
of lizards toads and flying insects
died to almost complete silence the
sun reflected in yellow radiance on the
peaks to the west before logan could
see across his imprisoning valley

  at sight of the old crater his
despair increased the cupped depres-
sion was not deep but twelve to
twenty feet of straight wall was as
unscalable as a thousand no man
alive could pull himself up those sheer
acclivities unaided

  logan again began the circuit of the
valley searching for a possible slant
or break that had escaped him in the
darkness he stumbled across the re-
mains of a deer skin taut over a pro-
truding skeleton dead of starvation
or age and not even a wild hog to tear
the carcass

  not until he was halfway around
did a backward glance reveal to him a
possibility above the detritus of the
avalanche he had brought down a thin
knives of the jungle



fissure showed no wider than a mans
body it lifted jaggedly to the valleys
rim he turned and raced back across
the crater floor

  it was almost inviting death to
creep into that fissure with the loose
earth and stones ready to cave and
bury him ticklish work but despera-
tion gave him nerve he plowed up the
slant of fallen earth and worked shoul-
ders and legs into the fissure by
pressing outward with his feet he
made purchase inch by inch he edged
upward once a small section caved
and fell over him he shook the clayey
mass from head and shoulders and
proceeded more carefully his heart
was hammering fitfully when he made
the top

  he crawled out concealed in the
brush and lay flat drawing deep
breaths minutes he waited to see if
the night attackers were about but
lack of movements assured him they
were not with fitful forebodings he
walked toward the camp

  he was sickened the moment he ar-
rived augustos body lay stripped a
mass of purpled blood and wounds
pena and the two cargadores had been
hacked with savage cruelty guns
uniforms and equipment were gone
as were all logans personal belong-
ings  spare uniform boots

  and of steve govern and nicanor
no sign remained

  had they taken to the brush hid-
den impossible they could not have
run into the brush unseen they would
have been caught

  logan began a widening circle about
the dead fire his sickened eyes ferret-
ing every clump of brush when an
hours search brought no reward
logan had grown suspicious of this
disappearance no white man could
evade the cat eyes of the moros and
inda didnt take prisoners

  but even with this mystery facing
him phil logan could not hang
around any longer over on the pu-
langi lieutenant mata waited

  with his pocket-knife the constabu-

lary captain sliced down a runner of
green rattan the juice that dripped
from it was almost pure water he
cooled his parched throat and tighten-
ing his belt struck eastward toward
the next low range of hills

  logan reached the muddy pulangi
in four hours twice he caught
glimpses of men in the brush and
once he lay hidden behind a molave
log while half a score of barong men
passed as he drew nearer his destina-
tion the feeling of peril increased

the sight of matas temporary
fort brought relief a sentry
paced before a gate in the mud walls
as logan strode forward

  the constabulary guard snapped his
rifle from right shoulder to port arms
then dropped it to a readier position

  halt whos there

  logan jerked to a stop command-
ing officer

  the sentrys eyes went wide at the
mud-spattered ragged american be-
fore him

  didnt you hear snapped logan
i said commanding officer call
out your guard dont you know your
orders

  the swarthy soldiers eyes held
logans unblinkingly stand where
you are over his shoulder he called
corporal of the guard post number
one

  a chevroned officer came running
through the gate in the mud wall
logan announced himself more se-
verely the corporal stared barked
an order four riflemen came out and
fell in about logan

  you wish to see the commanding
officer said the corporal mildly
very well i take you to him for-
ward march

  logan grinned sourly he didnt
know mata personally nor any of these
men but this was a laugh-if last
nights business had not removed all
traces of humor from him

  into the squared inclosure of the
fort they marched they proceeded to


thrilling adventures

a swali shack with a low stoop and
the corporal entered seconds later he
called to the riflemen and logan
was marched in

  phil logan thought his eyes must
be deceiving him for seated behind
a table an array of papers before him
sat a man in uniform a captains twin
bars of silver decorating each shoul-
der

  that man was steve govern

  logan thrust aside the rifleman
nearest him blood rushed to his head
in a torrent blinding him he barely
noted the native nicanor squatting
back in a corner

  what the hell are you doing here
he demanded

  governs heavy face did not change
expression

  im captain phil logan he rum-
bled did you want to see me

  logan almost choked

  why you damned impostor thats
my uniform youre wearing you cant
get by with this youll get a stretch
in bilibid prison you snake you
must have engineered that attack on
the camp last night

  govern sprang to his feet his face
purple with wrath

  corporal get this insane man out
of here

  logan took one step forward his
hands gripping the table edge

  crazy am i youll find out how
crazy i am if youre captain logan
how do you account for that partner
you got over there in the corner

  govern chuckled mirthlessly

  him why hes my personal ser-
vant my number one boy nicanor
what the hell you loafing here for
snap out of it and clean up my quar-
ters 

  alvaro gaped for an instant then
his face went livid anger flashed in
his jetty eyes rebellion at being or-
dered like a dog

  logans gripping hands snapped the
light table away the pent feelings of
the past few hours exploded in action
he did not know governs scheme but

what he did know was damnable this
surly govern was leagued with the
krismen and those hacked bodies-

the corporals guard sprang for-
ward-too late logan drove
across the yard of intervening space
and his right fist crashed toward the
heavy jaw a slight filtering of dust
rose when steve governs back hit the
bamboo flooring

  a startled ah rose from the lips
of the filipino lieutenant who had
been standing behind the bogus officer
-mata of course logan instantly de-
cided he was nicanor half lifted from
his squatting position his fingers
fumbling at his belt black hate
burned in his slitted eyes

  something hard bored into phil
logans back

  do not move growled the cor-
poral or my men shoot

  a momentary impulse came to lo-
gan to defy that order that govern
should expect to get away with this
was beyond reason how would the
surly devil profit by such a hoax the
set-up was screwy and logan was in
no mood for puzzles

  yet he had common sense enough
not to argue against a gun the cor-
poral and his men were not to be
blamed he watched steve govern get
slowly to his feet and thought he saw
momentary alarm glint in the big
mans eyes

  craft replaced that look of fear
by george lieutenant this man is
crazy he mumbled where did he
come from anyway

  without doubt yes crazy mata
quickly agreed perhaps the fever
we had best lock him up until we dis-
cover his identity

  you fool logan roared will
you let yourself be duped by this im-
poster youll get a court-martial
yourself-

  get him out of here corporal
governs braying voice bellowed
lock him up under guard

  a more extended survey of the fort
knives of the jungle



did not cool logans mind as they
marched him across the parade ground
formed by the inclosing walls this
must have been an abandoned village
signs of wanton destruction and fire
were evident indas work likely
some of the shacks had been tempo-
rarily repaired with unbarked branches
and spit bamboo on some of them
cogon thatch had not been replaced

  bamboo poles and lopped off
branches lay about the inclosure the
mud walls were scarcely breast high
and in some places had been piled
against the backs of the huts a lot
of work needed to be done immedi-
ately to make this fortress impreg-
nable against the hill moros

  the lack of military alertness irked
logan half the detachment were
lolling about the few on guard were
keeping half-hearted watch and all
the time phil logan knew sharp eyes
were watching from the forest the
fools datu inda with a score of men
could scale the walls if he dared at-
tempt it or was he too much of a fox
for that

  logan glowered he had come to
the pulangi to get inda now he was
marching with a gun in his back a
devil of a mess well whatever gov-
erns scheme was he would run into a
dead end before long phil logan
rubbed his knuckles thoughtfully
that fist hadnt finished its job yet

  at the guardhouse the corporal
turned the prisoner over to a sergeant
whom he addressed as gimenez and
repeated governs orders

sergeant gimenez searched
phil removing his pocket-knife
and wallet he spread the billfold and
seemed concerned that there was no
name there as he motioned to an ad-
joining shack the intelligent face of
the sergeant impressed logan favor-
ably

  sergeant youre making a mis-
take

  i but follow orders returned the
warrant officer you get in there i

post a guard before the door i warn
you to make no attempt to escape

  listen you look like a smart sol-
dier tell lieutenant mata i want to
see him but say nothing to the-er-
captain

  no doubt the lieutenant will ques-
tion you in time get in there i shall
have a man bring food

  you get mata or ill rip those chev-
rons off you bust you so damn
quick-

  gimenez turned away with a shrug
he too thought this strange white
man crazy loco americano

  the swali shack held no furniture
gecko lizards croaked discordantly in
the cogon thatch through the inter-
laced bamboo that made the swali sid-
ing a murky light filtered a door
and window opened toward the inclo-
sure but both were closed and latched

  the slow tramping of a guard came
to logans ears a prisoner

  slowly his rage settled to cooler
reasoning the ever present menace of
indas men forced him to think the
whole detachment in its present state
was not worth a squad of seasoned and
alert regulars yet they were the sol-
diers to whom he had been sent to sub-
due the mountain chieftain

  damn the pillaging inda if he
logan could just get inda and his
men face to face with spitting spring-
fields it would be another story inda
had never met the constabulary in a
pitched fight too crafty for that

 govern was mixed in with inda
somehow-but how logan would
have to settle with this big scoundrel
before he could get to inda there
must be a way

  logan had just finished eating the
food brought him when from far out
in the jungle a drum began to thump
faintly pulsingly like the dance of
savage feet

  soldiers came and went across the
little parade ground the guard was
changed a game of sipa was started
by a half dozen of the enlisted men
through a crack in the swali siding


thrilling adventures

logan saw govern and nicanor al-
varo in earnest conversation beside
the headquarters building

  logan stiffened as he noted it was
nicanor who was doing the talking
phil logan would have given a
months pay to have heard what the
two conspirators were saying he saw
govern seemingly protest and at one
time strike down nicanors gesturing
hand at last the bogus officer nodded
reluctantly and logan saw him stare
after the smaller brown man question-
ingly as nicanor walked away

  logan remembered nicanors fury
at being called a personal servant he
knew the inordinate pride of the na-
tives a break between those two
might mean a chance

  there was a rustle among the men
in the adjoining guardhouse

  never mind the guard a sharp
voice called

  the door of logans shack opened
and lieutenant mata entered

chapter iii

prisoners

mata was trim and
neat but there was
indecision in the na-
tive officers eyes
his gaze darted left
and right fearfully

  dont get the jit-
ters logan ad-
vised dont you
recognize a soldier when you see one
does that big hombre act like a cap-
tain of the constabulary

  mata nodded uneasily never have
i seen captain logan before but i
have heard of him who has not he
is famous in the constabulary i am
very happy he has come yet-

  yet youre not damn sure of him
isnt that it i know hes brought
written orders hes got my papers
but-can he tell you names of all the
officers in the mindanao department
ill bet a cocked hat he cant i can
not only that i can name every offi-

cer and every unit in the philippine
islands

 mata smiled knowingly a clever
man might get the list and memorize
still well captain logan does not
know how to write a military letter
he began one dear sir-

 thats a point that would trick
anyone not a soldier-

  a thick form darkened the doorway
steve govern stood there glowering
his knotted brows beetling over nar-
rowed eyes

  lieutenant mata inspect all quar-
ters he snapped then call as-
sembly im personally inspecting all
equipment this unit must be put in
fighting trim

  the stern quick commands counter-
acted matas indecision he saluted
snappily

  yes sir

  govern watched the junior officer
stride away then he swung toward
logan

 so youre trying to get next to
that coconut lieutenant eh think
youre a tough guy tin soldier well
you played hell with your prospects
when you slugged me in the office
logan faced him defiantly take
that gun off your hip and ill try it
again you havent got the nerve you
yellow snake

 governs smile was vicious im
backing this deal and youre out how
the hell you managed to get here alive
beats me but youre sure goin to
help my scheme itll work slick now
haw

  ill get you in the end you rene-
gade

  you wont get nothin suddenly
govern snapped his automatic from
its sheath guard he yelled bring
in that raw abaca tie up this man
hes trying to attack me again
under the muzzle of governs gun
logan could do nothing but submit
the raw hemp strands bit into his
arms and wrists even when drawn
across his booted ankles the steel-like
strands bit keenly
knives of the jungle



  thatll do guard get out

  govern bolstered his gun a cruel
glint dancing in his eyes

  so you would slug me tough egg
your blabbing mouths talking too
much youll wish to hell you never
had got here-

  straight and hard he hit phil lo-
gan in the mouth

  the bound man was hurtled back
against the wall he felt the hot taste
of blood from his crushed lips his
arms tugged at the biting hemp
futilely governs fist landed again
and again

  phil logans jaws clenched a red
haze danced before his eyes the sick-
ening jolts fogged his brain governs
face was like a man bereft of reason as
his pummeling fists crashed home

  logan stood until his knees buckled
beneath him and when he was down
steve govern kicked with the full
power of his legs before the last kick
landed phil logan was out   

arkness was thick again be-
fore logan regained his senses
he could not move and it was min-
utes before he remembered he was a
prisoner at the mercy of steve govern

  every nerve in his body seemed
hammered into raw ends efforts to
think made his head throb his recov-
ering thoughts ran in circles and
those circles were orbits of hate
against steve govern

  quick steps sounded outside the
prison shack there were words in
dialect over the rumble governs
words sounded

  throw him in there and post a
double guard the devil was trying to
signal the moros well settle his
goose tomorrow

  the door swung open logan saw
the grayed rectangle as a man was
hurtled into the room propelled by a
boot

  in that second the door was open
logan got a clear view of the man

  the new prisoner was nicanor al-
varo 

 an indefinable menace seemed
everywhere now the entrance of the
new prisoner could scarcely account
for it logans brain jerking out of
the haze of unconsciousness was a
throbbing blur of agony and hate the
torture of his body fought coherent
thought one fact alone was clear
there must have been a final break be-
tween nicanor and govern-a chance
for phil logan

 through the murky darkness he
saw nicanor squatting against the
wall a single blacker blot in the deep
shadows

  hist he called come here un-
tie me

  nicanor didnt move at first he was
like some crouching beast cowering
cornered ready to lash with tooth and
claw

 cant you understand me logan
tried again im tied up

 he heard a low guttural throat
sound nicanor was moving closer

  i am no mans servant the brown
man muttered

  so he was still smarting under the
appellation given him by steve gov-
ern but logan knew the colossal
vanity of the philippine islander
once a native considered himself
above menial tasks he was insulted to
the quick if given an order

 the brown man continued moving
toward him then logan saw with
dilated eyes the knife in alvaros
hand the guard must have tossed the
fellow in without searching him nica-
nor was lifting the knife slowly was
the enraged native furious at govern
venting his rage at all white men

  hells bells nicanor knifing me
wont get you anywhere listen
logans mind was stabbing wildly for
a plan i can get you out of here

  you white devils are all liars
nicanor spat

  the knife drew back a little logan
grabbed courage from the slight move-
ment

  i mean what i say what did gov
ern put you in here for anyway


thrilling adventures

  nicanor cursed in guttural dialect
he say i signal the moros

 moros

  ah si the warriors of the great
datu are all about us waiting the
black-hearted devil betray me now i
shall be killed with all the rest he is
cheating me of my pay

there was deep vibrance in nica-
nors words yet they scarcely
made sense

 what do you mean pay logan
demanded

  faugh a child could see it that
man is selling the soldiers lives for
pay for the gold and plunder that
datu inda promised us

  the import of those words was as-
tounding the detachment was to be
turned over to the natives of indas
krismen that was the reason for gov-
erns attack on the night camp tc get
the uniform the papers to imperson-
ate logan human lives for pay
death for the gold of datu inda black
as governs heart must be the thing
sounded incredible

  no white man would do that de-
clared logan

  do i not know was i not to share
with him every man shall be killed
the warriors of inda shall whet their
knives in human flesh even you and
i senor shall be dead before morn-
ing

  phil logan stiffened in his bonds
this thing must be stopped and there
was not a moment to lose

  listen nicanor you know im cap-
tain logan weve got to block gov-
ern the lives of all these men de-
pend on it youre in this deep a con-
spirator with govern but if you help
me maybe i can get you off if you
dont help me youll be hacked to
pieces with barongs chopped into
mincemeat ill get you out of here
give you a chance to wipe your slate
clean what do you say

 phil had never pleaded like this
with a native before but the brown
man had to help him alvaro sat like

a carved buddha in the gloom seem-
ing to absorb the words slowly

again the knife shifted forward
you will do this you do not lie to
escape past the guard is impossible
i have a scheme cut me loose
the knife snicked through the
bonds

  relief flooded logan and with it
weakness his cramped muscles at
first refused to function the flow of
blood into stopped veins was like a
thousand needles he pulled himself
to a sitting position and began slowly
to massage his wrists and ankles

  the terrific responsibility of his
position shook him this was his de-
tachment his men had to be saved
saved from massacre for back of the
treacherous govern waited inda the
robber the killer

  and there was more half a hun-
dred rifles would fall into the datus
hands the weapons would make him
formidable cost a long and bloody
war to get him blood and fire all
over the center of the island unless he
was stopped now

  nicanor was hovering near expec-
tant

  listen nicanor logan said
youre going to malabang see if
you take off your shirt tie a rag
around your head you can slip
through indas men all right once in
malabang you give the word and
theyll send us reinforcements un-
derstand

  i can get through i think but
you senor

  ill stick with the detachment in
some way ill block govern hold the
detachment here until help comes
once i convince lieutenant mata-

icanor stopped him impa-
tiently but to get out you do
not say-

  simple listen these shacks are
tied together with bejuco not a nail
in them the mud wall backs against
this shack you can snick that rattan
with your knife lay the sections of
knives of the jungle



swali back and youre over the wall
savvy 

  but the guard-he will hear it is
the rifle bullet that stops us

  be as quiet as you can but if the
guard comes snooping in ill manage
him are you game for the try

  a man tries anything for his life
senor

  it was risky the guard was pacing
the soft earth not a yard in front of
the door a whisper of a sound could
reach him his orders were to shoot
at any attempt to escape nicanor
could hardly hope to remove that swali
siding without noise

  but logan must get word to mala-
bang the detachment must be saved

  nicanor slipped out of his shirt and
wrapped a torn section of it around
his head his knife was softly work-
ing in the taut rattan lacings that held
the shack together he eased loose a
crossbrace and laid it on the floor
now for the corners and sides-

  a few seconds more

chapter iv

attack

logan heard the
pacing outside stop
the guard muttering
something would
he investigate or
shout to the ser-
geant logan then
pressed against the
wall flat beside the
door he was still groggy weak from
the punishment of governs fists his
legs and arms throbbed

  the guard came to the closed door
kicked it open with his foot already
the back wall of the hut was a dim
rectangle of gray as nicanor eased the
swali siding around the squeak of
twisted wythes raked the nerves

  silence commanded the guard
what you do there the muzzle of
his rifle poked into the shack

  nicanor pushed the last section of
swali back

  the guards rifle snapped to ready
pointing in the direction of the sound

  ah you break out i shoot-

  logans right hand closed upon the
lock of the rifle his forefinger loop-
ing the small knob of the hammer
the surprised guard gave a stuttered
exclamation as he squeezed the trig-
ger

  phils finger seemed scraped of skin
and tissue as the released bolt drove
toward the firing pin a numbing pain
laced his hand but he held pulling
the weapon inward with a heave the
guard clung to the rifle as his body
slanted through the doorway phils
left arm slipped around the head and
his hand closed over the mans mouth

  run nicanor quick

  the half-naked man went over the
mud wall like a springing cat

  logan must keep the guard quiet
give nicanor time the constabulary
soldier struggled like a wiry ape the
two fought and twisted into the cen-
ter of the hut falling into a tangled
heap the rifle was knocked from
their grasp

  sheer necessity drove logan every
second gave nicanor a better chance
to get through to the settlements

  logans left hand closed upon the
throat of the guard gripping into the
corded neck behind the kicking sol-
dier the open door of the hut stood
out in sharper gray the quick tropic
dawn had come

  phil logan hurled the man toward
the doorway the guard shot outward
like a tossed sack landing heavily
for seconds he was too shocked to
yell logan scooped up the fallen
rifle he stood for an instant uncer-
tain he couldnt use a springfield
against his own men better to have
no weapon lest the devil of necessity
tempt him he tossed it out after the
fallen soldier

  a couple of sleepy heads came pok-
ing out of the guard shack there
would be hell to pay in a moment
logan pulled the door around lest one
of these volatile men fire on him with-


thrilling adventures

out question as he closed the portal
the first rosiness of dawn was pinking
the sky above the luans and molaves
in minutes it would be broad day-
light

 something suddenly caught logan
with an invisible grip of fear he was
not psychic but the nearness of peril
warned him almost as if a voice
shouted in his ear the warning came
he glanced around just in time to see
a glitter of steel whip into the opened
side of the shack

  he dropped flat as if smitten by a
trip-hammer a heavy blade made a
singsong noise over his head and
buried itself hilt-deep through the
thin paneling of the door

logan saw a bare-torsoed form
appear over the low mud wall
and then another the very opening
nicanor had made to escape now pro-
vided a doorway for the moros

  datu inda the fox had smelled out
that hole with the first gray of the
dawning if that hurled barong had
not missed logan the entry would
have been perfect the charging
moros would have poured through
the shack fallen upon the drowsy
guard murdered the soldiers in their
blankets

  logan whirled to hands and knees
his hands gripped the crossbar that
nicanor had laid down so carefully
couching it like a lance he drove for
the foremost of the moros

  he struck the fellow squarely in the
chest with a grunted ugh the
turbaned man fell back logan par-
ried the blade of the next attacker
with the blunt end of the pole the
razor-edged barong went deep into the
wood the gaping moro tugged for
his weapon as logan drew back again
and drove for the betel-stained mouth

  logans shout rang like a clarion
call through the mud fort

 turn out the guard every man
up datu inda

 as the second knifeman went back
with a crunching of his filed teeth

shouts lifted from the guardhouse
the clicking of rifle bolts snapped
through the clamor men were running
along the sides of the house toward
the jungle were a score of bobbing
heads racing for the opened side of
the shack they were piling over their
fallen comrades a column of dark-
skinned men in a moment they would
be at phil logan

  a ringing a-a-ah-ee-e came from
the rim of the forest

  the door behind logan was torn
open there was the bark of an auto-
matic a moro wilted and fell from
the corners of the shack logan heard
men pawing at swali

  the automatic spat again logan
could feel the windwhip of the bullet
as he drove again at the mob of grim-
faced krismen

  lieutenant mata drew alongside
him coolly deliberately the officer
worked his automatic in the pinch of
emergency mata had the stuff he was
feeding the devils lead like a veteran
if he could hold out there was a
chance

  the pushed-out swali at the shack
corners was being battered down by
rifle barrels sergeant gimenez was
urging his men once the swali was
out of the way a crossfire could be
poured upon the howling charging
column

 from the edge of the forest a
springfield opened and then another
the pillaged guns of augusto and
pena a crude pipe gun thundered
like a charge of blasting powder
slugs tore into the cogon thatch a
steel-jacketed slug whined lower if
the brown gunner learned to hold the
front sight down-

  steve governs voice bellowed from
the parade ground above the clamor
of fighting

  back you fools back serteant
form a hollow square in the parade
ground

  lieutenant mata cursed in tagalog
in his excitement dropping to his na-
tive speech if we retreat we are
knives of the jungle



lost sergeant i am commanding
hold the corners of the house

 the obstructing swali went down
springfields spat into the flanks of
indas men as suddenly as the at-
tack began it melted the barong
men whirled and raced for the forest
sergeant gimenez men fired after
them

m ieutenant mata still dap-
s per in his khaki and red uniform
snapped his right hand to a perfect
salute

  captain logan sir i admit my mis-
take his ordering the men back
proves he is a traitor now i await
your orders

 logan dropped the pole a great
feeling of relief filled him not only
at the repulse of the moros but also
because mata had come through with
a scrapping subaltern like this he
could snap the detachment into shape
vage a campaign that would be deci-
sive

 he wondered if inda had been in
that charging column not likely the
crafty magahat did not endanger him-
self but there still was govern

 logan returned the lieutenants
salute his blue eyes met and held
those of the junior officer they un-
derstood one another

 you made a natural mistake he
said bruskly though govern would
have exposed himself sooner or later

  then permit me the privilege re-
quested mata of arresting that rene-
gade

  and how ejaculated logan

 mata stiffened as a springfield
cracked from the rim of the forest
the lieutenants eyes went wide un-
blinking a hole no larger than a
cigarette appeared in his temple blood
welled outward and trickled down his
cheek mata wove upon his knees his
head falling back

  logan caught the officer before he
fell in one cold appalling moment he
realized that the last chance shot from
the forest had found a target mata

the one man convinced of phils iden-
tity was gone

  steve governs hulking form filled
the doorway his automatic boring in-
ward to cover logan his eyes burned
like flames through smoked glass

  hold it he ordered dont move
or ill blast you down he took a step
into the room sergeant he bel-
lowed come here

  gimenez crowded in behind govern
his eyes went wide at the sight of
mata

  take that man prisoner com-
manded govern keep him under a
guns muzzle every minute he openecf
up the fort to the moros the damn
dirty traitor i ought to stand him
against a wall and have him shot

  gimenez looked hard at logan his
first friendly look changed to one of
hostility govern was playing his
hand well to deceive the men

  logan eased matas body to the
floor damn the breaks of luck only
the luck of that last shot had saved
govern from exposure but common
sense saved logan from rash action
there was the detachment to be saved
inda captured he dared not rush
govern now and go down his lips
pulled tight across his teeth

  if you want to wipe me out so
damn bad why dont you shoot he
defied

  the challenge was like a red flag to
governs bull temper the hand hold-
ing the automatic twitched hate
blazed from his eyes logan expected
leaden death yet somehow had a
hunch that govern was bluffing

  the silence in the shack pressed on
logans ears like a tangible force

 why dont you shoot he re-
peated

the blood drained from governs
cheeks white spots chalked his
mouth corners his eyes narrowed to
slits as abruptly as his fury had
risen it died the automatic sank

  take him sergeant he said husk-
ily we dont shoot men down in


thrilling adventures

the constabulary we give em a trial
remember that sergeant if you let
him loose ill court-martial you

  govern whirled and stumbled from
the shack logan stared after him
why hadnt he shot did he lack the
nerve hardly any man who could
have engineered that attack upon the
camp had no qualms at murder gov-
ern could have killed him at that mo-
ment with all the mad joy of stamp-
ing a rattlers neck yet-

  why hadnt govern shot

  the question loomed larger in lo-
gans mind he did not have the an-
swer

  shouted orders came from the pa-
rade ground there was a sound of
grounding arms and men falling into
line then governs voice was call-
ing orders to the warrant officers

  gimenez motioned phil with the
muzzle of his gun

  i have my orders he stated
tersely march

  oh yes sure logan answered
barely conscious that he spoke he
moved through the door to see the
detachment drawn up in company
front

  two men were removing the bar-
ricaded gate the detachment counted
off with a rattling click of syllables

  squads right march

  rifles snapped to right shoulders as
the squads pivoted

  company halt

  logan stared dumfounded was
govern marching out had he some
other ace in the hole some other pre-
arranged scheme with datu inda to
march out now was taking a perilous
chance of marching into ambush
even if there were no ambush there
could be constant sniping from the
brush was that what govern wanted

  somewhere nicanor was racing for
the settlements could help come in
time despair settled on logan slim
chance in an hours time the detach-
ment might be fighting its last fight
another victory for inda damn the
conniving magahat

  yet why hadnt govern shot got it
over with

 the front squads were ordered
ahead and logan was marched into
the break gimenez detailed a soldier
to guard him the throat-blackened
man logan had tossed out of the
shack no chance of eluding this fel-
low he would love to shoot phil
logans lips twisted grimly

  the detachment plunged into the
jungle dropped to double file and at
last to single quick step changed to
rout-step the morning sun broke
through the foliage above them

  steve govern led the way ten paces
ahead without looking back

chapter v

datu inda

phil logan paid
scant heed to the de-
tails of that march
they crossed the first
hills plowed through
a valley and came
again into the edge of
the mountains at
times brown-torsoed
men fled before them
and at sight of the fleeing moros mur-
murs ran along the line of riflemen
to them the great captain logan
had inda on the run

  the march slowed as the elevation
increased brush and trees made a
barrier through which the men fought
their way logan guessed them to be
in the vicinity of his tragic night
camp a break to the left showed the
craterlike valley the line swung in
almost to its brim

  logan did not see the weapon but
he heard a zipping sound a startled
cry came from the van

  captain logan

  steve govern had disappeared as if
swept away by a broom

  on the right flank what looked like
a thousand devils leaped from the
brush

inda inda a-ah-e-e inda
knives of the jungle



  the surprised detachment caught
hard upon the flank went over the
cliff like driven sheep with scarcely
a gun fired in self-defense logan
heard men clawing scrambling guns
rattling down a hooting krisman
was almost on top of him his own
guard had jumped im panic with the
rest logan dropped over the rim feet
first

  the moment he landed his eyes
searched for the fissure he had pre-
viously climbed it had been blocked
securely with stones and dirt the
detachment was trapped in the little
valley

  the triumphant guttural yells of
the moros swelled along the rim ba-
rongs and spears hurtled down one
soldier too shocked from his fall to
move was impaled where he lay the
remainder dived back hugging close
against the base of the cliff

  so this was the trick govern had
led the detachment to the cliff where
they could be swept by surprise into
the valley now it would be slaughter
they could be picked off one at a
time by hurled steel or pipe guns no
chance to use the springfields

  phil logan crouched against the
wall zipping steel was coming closer
now a second soldier was badly
sliced upon the arm several limped
from twisted ankles above throaty
yells of victory were a death chant

  what matter if nicanor reached
malabang now-a futile gesture
meaningless ice settled about lo-
gans heart

  out of his chilling thought he sud-
denly realized why govern had let
him live his body must be found with
the rest of the detachment the mas-
sacre was bound to be investigated
and it would be assumed that logan
himself had led the troops here that
he had been outgeneraled trapped
wiped out by inda no clue would
point to an impostor govern could
come and go as he liked unsuspected

  logans fighting spirit rose he
would not die like a fly pinned against

a wall the straight face of the cliff
was no more than fifteen feet up
with a platoon of trained regulars he
could scale it in minutes these
troops were not regulars but it had
to be done

he crept to the side of gimenez
sergeant you must have heard
the talk between me and lieutenant
mata you know im captain logan
captain logan has been killed
replied gimenez doggedly the men
saw him fall

  killed more likely he ran out on
you if you dont believe im captain
logan at least you saw me fight the
moros on the wall

  ah si you are brave-

  never mind that weve got to
get out of here

  are we birds to fly over the cliff
oriental fatalism engulfed gimenez

  thats no way for a soldier to talk
snap out of it sergeant listen if
you take orders from me the rest of
the men will are you going to die
like a stabbed pig

  i would try anything to save the
men

  thats the spirit now get this
take a squad of your best marksmen
and run to the center of the valley
open fire on the rim just above us
here clear a space ten yards wide
the moros will draw back but keep
plugging anyway

 but you-

  ill get the men up pass the word
along to obey me move

  gimenez leaped to the task with
alacrity a hoot went up from the
moros as the squad raced for the cen-
ter of the hollow a hurled spear
sliced the sergeants legging but he
made it and threw his men down be-
hind protecting boulders the spring-
fields opened in a concerted blast

  logans first orders were drowned
in the clamor it was tough to make
these filipino soldiers understand
but at last he lined three along the
cliff and mounted two more upon their


thrilling adventures

shoulders a second pair crouched to
give him a stepping start he slung
the springfield over his shoulder

  hang tight im coming

  gimenez and his men were working
the bolts of their rifles rapid fire
whipping the rim brush with lead
logan stepped on the crouching men
got a grip on the next shoulders and
went up

  the moros sighted the maneuver
and shouts went up rag-turbaned
men were gathering in a knot close
under a spur of a mountain a pipe
gun exploded viciously but the slugs
fell short hoots of bafflement fol-
lowed the report

  the second tier of men wavered
when logans weight pulled at them
but they held he reached got hold
of the rim and kicked upward sweat
stood on his brow but he swung side-
ward and rolled onto the level the
barrage of steel-jacketed lead was just
above him he had to risk that he
unslung the rifle and lowered it to the
next man who was scrambling up

  they were getting the trick of it
now mounting the wall like monkeys
the slugs sung higher as gimenez
squad lifted the sights logan de-
ployed the first half dozen men in a
skirmish line to keep back any im-
mediate attack he signaled the ser-
geant and the squad raced for the
wall and mounted they were all up
now but the three men left at the base
logan ordered shirts off and knotted
into a rope the last of the detach-
ment finally reached the rim

  the moros became ominously si-
lent a mass of still bodies and low-
ered weapons more rag-turbaned men
were racing in from the brush the
detachment was outnumbered three
to one but the moros were caught
on three sides the valley to their
right the spur behind them the de-
tachment in front at last inda would
have to meet the government troops
face to face

  a single moro clad in tight blue
trousers and yellow jacket was

mounted on the spur behind the war-
riors a white rag of turban bound
his head his arm was thrown out as
he harangued the krismen a brain-
shattering shout followed his words
inda inda a-ah-ee inda

  logan swung out his men in a broad
skirmish line no time to fall in
maneuver for a better position at-
tack was the best defense hit them
before they expected it give the
hooting devils hell

  forward fifty yards drop to
one knee fire

  the blast of concerted lead wilted
the front rank of the moros again
and yet again the springfields belched
the moros wavered faltering

  fix bayonets charge

logan was six paces ahead of his
line he had the rifle hed taken
up the cliff but no bayonet no mat-
ter indas men were milling shift-
ing incapable of forming a solid front
logan was plunging at them whip-
ping the army gun like a quarter stave

  he downed the nearest man as a
barong point touched his arm a sec-
ond tried in vain to reach him the
hard gunstock crunched upon a skull
they were scrambling stepping side-
ward now getting clear of this diablo
americano a third went down with
a reverse lunge of the gun butt he
heard the queer crash of steel and
human bodies as his own line struck

  the impetus of his charge carried
him through the turbaned ranks war-
riors were streaming to their left
forming on the detachments flank
he heard the crack of springfields as
the right of the line doubled to meet
this menace

 where was inda he had him
trapped at last the man in the blue
trousers and yellow jacket must not
get away logan began to run for-
ward circling around the spur one
sight of that garish jacket was all he
wanted he must be captured or
killed now lest he escape and form
his raiders anew
knives of the jungle



  a figure shot upward from behind
a rock the yellow jacket was almost
in logans face a stolen springfield
bored at the americans stomach

  stop a high-pitched voice de-
manded

  logan stopped in complete surprise
frozen to the spot his own gun
slipped from startled fingers almost
his hands went up

  the face above that yellow jacket
was nicanor alvaros

  time stopped in one appalling sec-
ond logans mind went blank ni-
canor here incredible then like
wind rushing into a vacuum the truth
came nicanor alvaro and datu inda
were one and the same person

  he had helped to escape the very
man he wanted it had been a trick
that pretending nicanor was a pris-
oner a scheme to get logan to help
open a way into the fort without the
soldiers realizing it the audacity of
this mountain fox was amazing

  things logan had not understood
before now became clear nicanor
had been his real enemy all along not
govern steve govern was but a hire-
ling a tool and in the end had been
paid off in traitors coin-a foot of
steel in the back inda had wiped out
his white partner as he would wipe
out all the others and now he stood
with a springfield boring at logans
waist

  you will order your men to cease
firing captain logan at once i
shall not wait to pull this trigger
long

indas ugly face was taut as an
iron mask murder gleamed in his
deep black eyes

  and if i dont

  i cannot miss at six feet speak

  to order the detachment to lay
down its arms meant massacre that
inda would let logan live if he
obeyed was asking too much but
could gimenez carry through to vic-
tory if phil logan went down either
way he turned inda won he had

fought through to this-to galling de-
feat death

  a strange calmness of futility pos-
sessed logan there was a hint of
amusement in his tone when he spoke

  you wont shoot me until you pull
that bolt back youve got to ram a
cartridge into the barrel you dont
know army guns datu inda

  would the trick work could he
make inda hesitate a moment

  indecision flashed in the brown
mans eyes as they dropped for one
split second toward his weapon

  logan acted he plunged at the
trousered legs like a football tackle

  a report nearly deafened him the
muzzle blast burned his cheek like a
driven flame but his arms went
around indas knees his head drove
like a ram into his stomach inda
went over like a toppled linesman

  logan was up first he kicked at
the moros arm saw the rifle plunge
away inda sprang upright like a cat
but he was between logan and the
mountain spur he tried to paw into
his sash but logan was at him ham-
mering slugging

  with cold steel inda might work
but against american fists he had no
defense logans hard knuckles
crashed into him again and again

  inda squirmed and ducked but he
could not evade the barrage of shat-
tering blows he clawed bit but
logan straightened him up with stiff
jabs his first look of fury changed
to amazement and then to stupefied
confusion he tried to whirl away
leaving his chin uncovered

  logans right knuckles drove hard
and true

  that for augusto and pena

  inda wilted like an emptied sack

  logan rubbed his bruised knuckles
could that limp form be datu inda
the killer just a bundle of yellow
jacket and blue pants he had ex-
pected to get this mountain magahat
with whining lead but it had not
worked out that way just hard

springtime bathed the pre-
historic world in all its glory-
springtime and mating time
for that was what it meant on the
huge towering cliff that reared high
into the air score upon score of cave
people squatted or stood or lay flat on
their stomachs on the ledges that
seemed piled one on top of the other
along the face of the great stone

  all eyes narrow under low reced-
ing foreheads were fastened intently
on the scene that was being enacted

brute force and animal
cunning are pitted against
the birth of thought as
primitive men battle

great jaw grasped long hair and
held her to him


dawn of reason



below them occasionally they would
emit weird harrowing sounds the fe-
male voices high and piercing in joy
or despair the males low and gut-
tural in satisfaction or anger

  beneath them on the grassy plain
many of their fellows were clustered
about in a wide uneven ring in the
center of it the excitement of the
moment prevailed for there it was
that the battles to determine superior-
ity were taking place according to
custom

  a male choosing the maiden that
suited him best would step proudly
forth into the center of the ring and
proclaim to the tribe that he was
there to fight for his choice then
if any other wished the maiden for
his own he too would strut forth ut-
tering weird unintelligible gibberish
and give the first one battle

  sometimes the frays were of long
duration sometimes they were speed-
ily finished the short battles were
the more cruel for before they were
over death had usually intervened
the longer ones were more humane
for they generally ended when one of
the combatants was unable to continue
through sheer lack of breath then
the victor who had fought his battle
with his bare hands alone would
march off triumphantly with his mate
to a cave in the steep cliff-side un-
less of course another wished to give
him battle this was seldom for the
males and the females were fairly
evenly divided

 the noise among the watchers
broke out with renewed vigor as
young slim hips stepped forward he
was almost strikingly different from
any of the tribe he carried himself
more upright he had not so much hair
on his body his arms did not hang so
far below the knees in that loose man-
ner that suggested the gorilla also
his forehead seemed to be higher and
broader than those of the others
while the eyes under it were larger
and occasionally had an odd gleam in
them-a gleam that savored of intel-

ligence his chin and jaw too were
not so incongruously prominent

  slim hips he was called because of
the thinness of his body particularly
about the loins

straight and slim and proud he
stepped out into the midst of the
circle his head high his eyes flash-
ing he pointed silently to a maiden
who stood on the inner edge of the
crowd a lithe graceful creature with
soft eyes and hair that reached below
her knees hair so long that she was
called long hair she was looking at
her suitor with an expression of fear
in her eyes for his safety

  it was no surprise to the tribe when
a huge strapping fellow lurched for-
ward into the circle his eyes ablaze
his great hands clenching and un-
clenching as they hung down almost
to his ankles the race for the girl
had narrowed down to these two-to
the strong powerful monster of a
man and the straight wiry stripling
of a lad who was barely twenty it
surely looked like an uneven battle
and those who favored slim hips
groaned the girl was among that
number

  action soon came big hands the
other suitor believed in the power of
aggressiveness with a bestial snarl
he made a rush for slim hips with
murder in his heart the stripling
held his ground until the last moment
then as his huge antagonist launched
out for him he deftly stepped to the
side and quickly put out his foot
sending his opponent crashing to the
ground in a tangled heap instantly
he was on top of the fellow raining
blow after blow to his face with quick
jolting jabs

  but as the fallen one regained his
breath and roared out his anger slim
hips gracefully sprang away ran to a
spot perhaps thirty feet or so to the
side and again stood his ground the
cheers of his sympathizers split the
air in a confused babel of sound

  once more big hands hurled him


thrilling adventures

self fiercely at his adversary and once
more he found himself sprawling on
the ground with slim hips immedi-
ately on top of him and pounding with
all his might and main

  for a long long time this contin-
ued slim hips would stand his
ground until the last moment skip to
the side trip his aggressor and again
fall on him with all the strength and
fury he possessed all about the huge
ring the fight went the lad sometimes
darting in and out among the watch-
ers with almost incredible speed and
agility it was speed and dexterity
and brain pitted against sheer brute
force without intelligence

 and speed and brain and not
strength alone triumphed after a
long weary hour or more had gone
by big hands was at last subdued
glad to be able to lift his head from
the earth and to crawl silently away
with life still coursing through his
body

  cheer after cheer-weird cheers-
broke out as the visitor stepped forth
to claim the object of the fray the
lad was well liked few though even
his closest sympathizers had deemed
it possible for the stripling with the
slim body to actually best the great
and powerful male with the huge
hands an yet he had done so-with
the one weapon the others did not
possess superior intelligence

  proudly and with head erect slim
hips walked quickly over to the side
of the maiden for whom he had fought
his valiant battle coyly she came
toward him her head lowered her
eyes looking up into his from be-
neath lowered lashes but then as
he was about to grasp her hand and
lead her to the cave he had picked out
a sudden shout of crazed fear broke
from the audience slim hips turned
about with a start instinctively sens-
ing trouble

there was good reason for the
shout of frightened alarm com-
ing from the woods on a slow lumber-

ing trot was great jaw the tallest
and strongest and most feared male
the tribe had ever known he stood
fully six feet seven inches and had
he carried himself erectly would
surely have been over seven feet
every muscle and limb was built on
colossal proportions while he had a
face that would truly strike terror
into the heart of the bravest

  his forehead was smaller and more
receding than that of any other male
of the tribe his small eyes gleamed
with a reddish cruel light but the
most noticeable thing about him was
his jaw it stuck far out over his
chest and his lips always seemed to
be open in a diabolical fearsome sort
of grin

  he chose to have his home on the
other side of the cliff away from the
tribe and yet he practically ruled
them with an iron hand he obeyed
none of their crude yet fairly just
laws when he wanted a thing he took
it no matter to whom it belonged
he had the strength with which to do
it and none could gainsay him for
brute force ruled

  from the baleful glitter in his eyes
all knew that he was up to some vil-
lainy now and so they knew what
the brute was after his small burn-
ing eyes fell upon what he apparently
sought-the comely long hair with
wild guttural shouts he split his huge
mouth in a leer of desire and rushed
for her

  slim hips was quick to act he
knew well knew for a certainty that
he had not the atom of a chance of
standing against this fearful giant
here unfortunately his speed and su-
perior intelligence would avail him
naught therefore thinking quickly
he suddenly grasped long hair by the
hand and darted swiftly off through
the crowd making for the woods that
loomed up before him with all the
speed of his supple legs with a har-
rowing roar great jaw burst through
the scattering tribe and followed like
some superhuman creature who would
dawn of reason



wreak devastation upon the whole
world

  slim hips was well aware that the
prospect before him was far from
pleasant it simply meant pitting his
own and the maidens fleetness against
the almost unbeatable speed and en-
durance of the dreaded great jaw

  like two flashing deer the lad and
the maiden made their way into the
thickest part of the woods where the
traveling would be harder for their
monstrous pursuer through vines
they crashed over big fallen logs
across dangerous swamps all over the
most intricate places they could find
yet always with mighty roars of
anger great jaws stupendous bulk
would come tearing after them hurl-
ing through vine and swamp and un-
derbrush on his maddened chase ut-
terly oblivious to thorny bushes

  finally the two pursued ones had
to take to the trees there they
thought they would have great jaw at
disadvantage but though that might
have been true under ordinary cir-
cumstances and they might have
beaten him today he seemed fired
with an ability that would not allow
them to best him he climbed huge
trunks swung from branch to branch
made leaps that seemed incredible for
one of his weight all as if he were
some unearthly sprite whose bulk
was nothing as he grasped some slim
branch that seemed as if it would
surely crack into splinters beneath
him

  for long tedious hours the racking
chase continued the lad and the
maiden putting up a game and noble
fight against the sheer stamina and
strength of their remorseless enemy
then as long hair was gradually
breathing more heavily and showing
signs of fatigue ill luck visited the
fleeing pair

suddenly as she was making
a leap from tree to tree behind
slim hips her strength seemed to
fail her as she clutched convulsively

out and missed her mark by perhaps
the small margin of five or six inches
hurtling down to the ground about
twenty feet below and although she
and her kind could stand a marvelous
amount of punishment it was fully a
minute before she was again able to
get onto her feet and that one little
moment or so was what turned the
tables

 great jaw emitted a bellow of sat-
isfaction as he saw her fall he
plunged onward with a new burst of
speed slim hips two trees ahead
also turned about with great fear on
his face as he heard long hair shriek
instantly he swung back and made
his way to the point where disaster
had befallen

  the monstrous pursuer though
reached her first just as she rose to
her feet he grasped her in his arms
and held her struggling form to him
as if she had been no more than a wisp
of straw while he stood there with his
wicked eyes leering death and his
horrible mouth wide open shouting
murderous gibberish that gave slim
hips to understand death would
surely be his should he dare approach
within striking distance

  slim hips clenched his hands and
made as if to rush forward and fight
the fight of his life in order to regain
what he had already justly and gal-
lantly won but as he looked again
at the towering bulk before him he
gritted his teeth and held back help-
less rage coursed through him well
he knew that if he ever went within
striking distance of the great creature
before him death would be his a
death so quick that he would hardly
know it others had tried to do away
with the tyranny of great jaw and
slim hips remembered what had hap-
pened to the poor creatures he had
mangled

  no there was no coping with this
monster who broke all the laws of the
tribe at his will crude laws as they
were for sufficient reason had not
come to the cavemen to enable them to


thrilling adventures

join forces and do away with the
despicable great jaw as yet they
fought but singly each for himself
alone

  great jaw a cunning cruel goading
leer on his lips roared out unintelligi-
ble remarks to slim hips that were
meant to anger the lad into losing his
head and trying to regain long hair
but the stripling knew that for the
present it was hopeless should he
attempt it death would be his if he
held back he would still have life
and in his simple brain he knew that
he who had life still had some hope
however small it might be

  therefore with anger swelling his
heart and showing plainly on his face
he had to stand helplessly by while
great jaw marched back in the direc-
tion of the cliff with the bride for
whom slim hips had fought so val-
iantly it was not the first time that
the tyrannical villain had cheated
others of their just due

  for what seemed to slim hips a
long long while he stood alone his
head bowed low on his chest the pic-
ture of utter despair his brain cried
out dumbly against the gross injustice
of the world he had according to
the tribal laws fought his fight
against big odds and won and now
because of the desire of a being who
was heavier and stronger and bigger
the wife for whom he had so gallantly
battled was taken away from him
without the slightest chance of re-
gaining her

  it was not right this was his one
and only thought it was not right
and yet in his crude untrained brain
he realized that there was no way in
which he might take long hair away
from the bestial great jaw

vrarious others of the tribe knew
this well perhaps they too had
wondered within their immature
brains whether there was not some
way of stopping great jaws ruthless
might as yet though none had
thought of any way whereby brutal

strength committing a wrong act
could be justly disciplined great jaw
had lived his free and cruel life with-
out interference had he not a
strength that was equal to that of any
three men on the cliffs

  but night was coming on and slim
hips thought of the all-important fact
that faced him-the need for a safe
sleeping place for the night this
of course must be where the dreaded
saber-toothed tiger one of the great-
est enemies of his kind could not find
him also it must be where no poison-
ous reptile could inflict the deadly
germ from which there was no escape
terror and danger lurked at every
hand reaching forth for victims

  there would have been no use of
his going back to the cliffs only the
chance of death-from great jaw-
awaited him there for the present
at least he was a fugitive from his
own home because of anothers vil-
lainy

  after walking about the gigantic
and prolific forest for some twenty
minutes or so slim hips settled on a
high lone tree that reared above the
others surrounding it in a big crotch
on the topmost limb he stretched
himself out for the night-a fairly
safe refuge for it commanded a view
of all that went on about slim hips

  the next morning with the rising
of the huge ball of sun slim hips
was awake and down on the earth
foraging for his breakfast he partly
satisfied his hunger with berries and
roots that grew about in the woods in
profusion but as hed had no morsel
of food since noon of the day before
these did not thoroughly fill his empty
stomach and so with the patience
that he and his kind had learned so
well he set himself about the irksome
task of procuring more filling food
meat

  the tribe had no weapons except
their hands in consequence slim
hips searched about for an animal
runway leading to a spring or water-
ing-hole after he had found one that
dawn of reason



impressed him favorably he stretched
himself on the grass behind a friendly
bush and waited his eyes searching
his ears sensitive to the least noise
his whole body rigid

  it was slow and tedious work but
he knew of no other way of doing it
after what seemed an interminable
time to the hungry stripling he heard
a far-off rustling he drew in his
body to be ready for the spring pres-
ently a huge wild turkey came cluck-
ing and scratching down the path in
search of water its feathers long and
deeply colored

  slim hips waited until it was
abreast of him then with surpris-
ing speed and deadly aim he shot
straight out for the unsuspecting
creature the sinewy fingers of his
right hand closed with a snap over the
birds neck there was a raucous gob-
ble then the turkey fell limp as its
neck broke in two instantly but
leisurely now slim hips devoured his
hard-earned meal it was a crude way
to hunt and a crude way to eat but
weapons and fires for cooking were
undreamed of

  his hunger appeased slim hips
felt the cruel and insistent stab of
something far worse than hunger
could possily have inflicted-the loss
of the mate and wife he loved and
had justly won he railed futilely at
the order of things that allowed such
as great jaw to commit atrocious ac-
tions he railed madly and uselessly
for he could think of nothing that
might possibly help him to do away
with the brute with the superior
strength

for the greater part of the morn-
ing slim hips wandered aim-
lessly through the forest groping
vainly and dumbly for some way of
ridding the tribe of the bestial great
jaw he felt tired and discouraged
and after an hour or so had passed
threw himself down onto the ground
with a loud sigh he felt indeed
that never would he regain the comely

long hair there was no hope while
great jaw lived

  idly he picked up a rock that lay
at his feet and hammered at the boul-
der against which he had propped
himself-merely to keep his hands
moving while his thoughts were
troubled suddenly he noticed that
with each blow the rock in his hand
struck the boulder it knocked off a
little sliver of stone from the larger
boulder

  slim hips forehead so much
broader and wider than any of his
kind was creased into innumerable
lines his mouth was wide and gap-
ing in his eyes there was a queer
startled look that told that within his
crude brain some slight power of rea-
soning had entered

  for perhaps ten long minutes slim
hips sat with that queer look on his
face then it left him and he smiled
-a wide incredulous smile of joy
quickly he arose and looked about
along the grass and leaves on the
earth finally he discovered what he
was looking after-a hard big nut left
over from the autumn before usually
this form of sustenance was cracked
by his kind with their teeth for teeth
were strong in consequence of the
many duties they were required to
perform

  slim hips holding the nut care-
fully between the index finger and
thumb of his left hand placed it on
a large stone then with his right
hand he grasped the small rock and
brought it down heavily on the hard
shell of the nut it cracked and flew
into a thousand pieces simultane-
ously the stripling allowed a high
joyous cry to escape his lips-a cry
born of the reason that was slowly
but surely gripping a foothold in his
brain

  for the next few minutes the lad
broke nut after nut all the while with
a gleeful smile of joy playing about
his lips next he went from tree to
tree and tried to see what impression
he could make upon the hard trunk


thrilling adventures

and each time the rock bit into the
wood his smile would expand

  he found though that the harder
he struck anything the more it hurt
the hand in which the rock was held
this he reasoned in his practically
new-found brain would not allow him
to strike a really tremendous and tell-
ing blow again the queer look of se-
rious thought came into his face and
wrinkled his forehead and puzzled his
brain

  again after a few moments had
gone by a great cry issued from his
lips and he rushed madly about the
immediate vicinity in search of some-
thing soon he picked up a stout
heavy club that was perhaps a trifle
over a foot in length after which he
searched hastily around for a vine
that was thin and pliable and yet pow-
erful and unbreakable

  presently he found one that satis-
fied him with great slowness and
care he proceeded to place the stone
at one end of the club and to wind it
securely to the club with the tough
elastic vine

  at last it was finished stepping to
a tree he raised his weapon and
brought it down against the trunk
with all the strength his arm pos-
sessed the rock held firmly in its
place the blow did not hurt his hand
and the head of his weapon bit into
the wood many times deeper than he
would have been able to make it do
with his hands alone a shout of joy
came to his lips

but he was not satisfied as to the
sureness of his weapon hastily
he made his way back to the runway
near the watering-hole where he had
caught his breakfast with great cau-
tion he hid himself behind a thick
clump of bushes his eyes wide with
excitement his club raised and ready
for instant action his whole body
trembling under the strain that
gripped him

  several large birds came down the
pathway but these were not what he

wanted several of the smaller and
harmless animals skirted his hiding
place but these also were not what
he sought at last he heard something
coming along that he knew must be
an animal of fairly good-sized propor-
tions-a deer perhaps

 peering out from his clump of
bushes he saw a huge proudly-
antlered buck coming valiantly down
the path an animal that the cavemen
had always deemed too big and
strong for them to handle

  slim hips waited until the beast
was but a few feet from him then
with a shout he sprang directly in
front of it and brought down his
weapon straight for its head with all
his strength it struck the deer full
and squarely between the eyes a ter-
rific blow

  the result to slim hips was truly
marvelous with a snorting moan the
big creature reared up on its hind legs
swayed there a moment then toppled
down to the ground in a crumpled
heap dead the stone with all the
lads force behind it had penetrated
the brain of the big animal without
any trouble at all

 and slim hips with a new and
great shout of joy pulled out his
weapon and rushed madly off in the
direction of the cliffs now indeed
there was some chance of his ridding
the tribe of the tyranny of the dreaded
and horrible great jaw

  late that afternoon as the tribal
village was bathed in the warm glow
of the setting sun slim hips returned
to meet the powerful great jaw he
walked with head erect eyes flashing
and with a step that was springy and
easy and told of confidence supreme
hanging from his right hand close
to his side so that it was barely dis-
cernible was the club with the at-
tached stone that was not known to
the cavemen

  as he neared the cliffs several of
his kind out searching for roots and
berries before the dark made them
take to their caves let out low warn-
dawn of reason



ing cries to him they told him with
their signs and mode of talk that to
enter the domain practically ruled
over by great jaw would be quick and
instant death for him yet the lad
with a smile on his lips such s they
had never seen quietly shook his head
and proceeded calmly on his way fol-
lowed at a cautious distance by those
who had warned him

  they knew somehow that he had
come to do battle with great jaw
why they knew not for he who
would do so must truly be mad
therefore they felt that they would
but witness the death of a peaceful
stripling who had been liked by all

  as slim hips came out of the woods
and onto the grassy plain before the
cliffs there arose a noise that was
deafening men and women and chil-
dren swarmed from their caves and
shouted their queer sounds at one an-
other as they spied the slim lad walk-
ing apparently straight into his
death high high up on the cliffs on
a narrow perilous ledge slim hips
saw long hair clinging there desper-
ately with not an inch to spare

  he turned to the nearest of his peo-
ple asking them what that meant
gradually they made him know that
the maiden when great jaw had re-
turned with her had broken from his
embrace and made her way up to the
cliff to a ledge where it was utterly
impossible for his huge bulk to follow
or reach her a glad cry broke from
slim hips and he shouted at her re-
assuringly

then great jaw entered the scene
he came like a wild and crazed
tornado hearing the sounds of the
cavemen he had come from around
the other side of the cliff to see what
they meant instantly he had spied
slim hips all his fearful anger
arose the slim lad had dared to re-
turn great jaw was crazy mad

  the loss of the maiden and his in-
ability to reach her had made him
furious but to have this cub of a

stripling come back after the threats
he had received was surely heaping
insult on injury with a snarl and a
flashing of teeth and a roar that was
uncanny to hear great jaw waved his
monstrous arms and came straight out
for the lad

  men and women and children scat-
tered before his approach with shrieks
of terror as they fled in all direc-
tions they cried out supplicatingly
to slim hips above it all though
the lad heard a high piercing moan
break from the lips of long hair he
only smiled up at her confidently and
firmly stood his ground like some sol-
itary sentinel bravely holding his
ground before the advance of a regi-
ment

  in a moment great jaw was almost
upon him still roaring out his rage in
a voice that echoed and reechoed
throughout the surrounding wood-
land as he came to within some ten
feet of slim hips the giant brute
halted with an expression of utter be-
wilderment on his face it seemed
preposterous to him that anyone
should ever have stood up before him
even now he could barely believe it
was so then with a cruel flash of
his eyes and another of his horrible
bellows he flung himself straight out
through the air at the lad before him

  terrified shrieks rent the air as the
tribe expected to see the poor lad in-
stantly crushed to death instead
they saw the stripling spring quickly
to one side raise his arm high in the
air and bring the odd-looking thing
he held in his hand cleanly and
squarely down in the center of great
jaws forehead

  then far more surprising to them
than all else they saw the huge brute
throw up his hands fall backward
and stay swaying in the air while a
single ear-splitting cry of terror was
issuing from his lips the next in-
stant they saw him plunge suddenly
to the ground twitch there for a brief
second and slowly flatten out with a

steve hugh macdonald
the district supervisor said
to ranger steve burch we dont
want our record spoiled by a fire this
late in the season

  there was a deep affection for the
older man in burchs good brown
eyes he pushed back from the break-
fast table and began to clear it

  quit worrying burch said ill

days of fishing season and ill bet
you a new hat for carrie we get
through them without a fire

  its a graft macdonald growled
i thought i was through buying hats

her but ill take you its worth
it-

  the cabin door slammed open sud-
denly and a big man stood there he


smoke



looked at them out of small cold eyes

  my names jones he said id
like to hire a guide

  behind jones burch saw another
man tall and blond with a strange
bitter look around his mouth and eyes
they were both dressed in new stiff
outdoor clothes fishermen burch
had seen hundreds like them in the
past month

  sorry burch said we cant give
you a guide

  the heavy face of jones took on a
sullen cast ill pay he said and
drew a roll of bills from his pocket

  burch stiffened slightly his voice
lost some of its cordiality but was
still controlled

  no you see we cant furnish
guides for everyone so we make a
practice of saying no ill give you a
pass though and youll find the trail
well marked if you get lost well find
you in a hurry theres no danger
youd just have to spend an extra day
or so in the woods thats all

  time is important the big man
said

burch was vaguely aware of a
tenseness in supervisor macdon-
alds silence he wondered at it and
saw macdonald get easily to his feet
and move to the back of the cabin

  sorry burch said doggedly to the
big man i cant help you

  give you a hundred bucks

  no

  five hundred then

  no

  a grand and the big mans voice
hadnt changed

  a hot refusal was on the tip of
burchs tongue when macdonalds
voice sliced through the silence thin
and clear

  put up your hands

  startled burch swung in his chair
to see the district supervisor holding
a rifle in tight hands the rifle bore
directly on jones stomach

  mac burch gasped then looked

at the big man somehow the pouches
under jones eyes had stiffened his
face had become lined and cold his
hands crawled up to his shoulders

  sure youd pay plenty for a guide
macdonald rasped and times im-
portant all right you robbed the jas-
per city bank and killed a cashier last
night i got that over the radio early
this morning at headquarters this
was supposed to be your getaway but
its as far as you go

  you think so the big man said

  a sudden shower of falling glass
jerked burchs head to the window
a hairy paw holding a gun appeared
through the break macdonald swung
the gun that way desperately but too
late-

  the gun in the window spat flame
and roared

  macdonalds head snapped back
the gun clattered from his nerveless
fingers and he crashed to the floor an
ugly hole was under his right eye
the back of his head was nothing at
all his body jerked several times and
then was still

  burch stared at macdonalds still
body for several long seconds his
mind would not believe what his eyes
had seen it had happened too quickly
too simply a short moment ago mac-
donald had been talking to him and
now macdonald was dead

  a moaning curse jerked through
burchs mouth he threw himself at
the big man blindly unthinkingly
there was no room for thought in his
mind no room for anything but that
insane curtain of red

  vaguely he felt his fist connect
with bone felt the bone crunch under
his knuckles a voice boomed a star-
tled curse hands clutched at him
bore him down a tremendous weight
came down on his chest he struck
out blindly at the face that hovered
above him a man grunted in pain

  twisting he managed to free one
leg and lashed out a booted foot the
boot struck something solidly and a


thrilling adventures

voice made a shrill whining sound
but that was the last for burch
he stopped trying to fight tried
to protect himself from the unend-
ing attack of fists and guns finally
even that was impossible there was
nothing but the ceaseless shock of
blows and the closing curtain of dark-
ness   

  the big man said come on come
on snap out of it

  burch felt himself dragged up by
rough hands he was held in that
position by the slack of his shirt
dimly he could see the big mans face
close to him it was only a hazy disk
but the eyes burned out of it with a
small red glare the nose was oddly
shaped and something red spilled
from it across his mouth to stain his
shirt front

jones cursed dully struck burch
across the mouth burchs head
snapped loosely across his shoulder
rolled back

  jones said want some more
burch could only stare at him he
knew now this man was not jones
but joe ridack the blond one was
bishop the one at the window to-
nelli everyone had heard of them
they were public enemies they had
robbed a bank-killed a cashier-
killed macdonald-

  i want a guide ridack rasped
and thats you you goin to play
ball or do we start over we like to
play games too

  steve burch nodded not trusting
words past his teeth

  okay then ridack shoved him
toward the limp body of macdonald
the first thing you do is get rid of
the old guy haul him off in the brush
-tonyll go with you

  burch glared redly at ridack across
the dead body of the old man his
eyes were not quite sane tears
trickled down his face not tears of
grief but madness ridack cursed and
walked toward him steve burch bent

quickly and snatched the old man
from the floor he held him tightly
and went out of the cabin

  tony-or tonelli-was a short man
with small bowed legs and tremen-
dous rounded shoulders a half va-
cant smile always curled his fleshy
lips his eyes were small and red and
ape-like and they never seemed to
take an interest in anything

  he followed steve burch into the
woods

  leaving the body of the old man be-
hind a log burch thought how still
and quiet the old mans face was it
was relaxed and stared up at burch
blankly burch felt that he should say
something before he covered it and
went away but as his mind groped
for words tonellis gun prodded him
back toward the cabin

  he had to clean the cabin clean the
blood off the floor and set the cabin
straight so no one would know what
had happened he did that and made
out a pass for these men they tried
to argue with him about the date he
gave it up finally and wrote what
they told him to then they all went
outside

  burch led the way off down the
skyline trail ridack followed close
behind him then bishop then to-
nelli

  it was a long morning and the sun
was hot the familiar rise and turn
of the trail and the sun on his back
and all the rest of the things he had
come to know helped burch back to
normal there was a relief in exer-
tion an escape for the pressure that
clouded his mind by noon he was
again normal

  they ate in silence burch was
aware of ridacks eyes following his
every move strangely the glance
didnt seem angry in fact there was
nothing personal about it at all the
killer might have been thinking about
most anything burch knew that it
wouldnt make any difference to that
face ugly now with a swollen bluish
smoke



nose whether the mind behind it was
thinking of murder or not the face
would not reveal the thought

  finally ridack said how long will
it take to get through

  burch was surprised he could an-
swer its forty miles he said thick-
ly sometime tomorrow night is a
guess

  well make it by early evening
maybe burch said what if i
take you out and lose you

  you wont well get there or else
-see what i mean

  the argument seemed senseless but
burch went on whats the differ-
ence i wont live to tell about it
either way why not take it now
well let you go if we can find a
way to keep your mouth shut for a
couple of hours

  i bet you will but it doesnt make
any difference you wont get away
even if you do get to the pass therell
be guards there looking for you

ridack laughed his head tipped
back and his bruised mouth gaped
his amusement burch would have
liked to put his hands on that working
throat he thought it would feel very
good but ridack stopped laughing
then and leaned forward

  listen he sneered you cant
think of anything i havent thought
of and figured on i made you date
our passes day-before-yesterday
didnt i so that made us up here
in the timber at the time the bank was
knocked over therell be a bunch of
other fishermen going out at the same
time because this is the end of the
season theyll look at our passes see
the date and let us through nice
eh

  i suppose so burch admitted
you suppose so ridack snorted
hell-its perfect

  it was perfect all right steve
burch knew that as well as ridack
they would get through and then
there would be no way of catching

them again and if they did it would
be burchs own fault-he shouldnt
have given them the passes

  if he could get away he could go
on ahead and warn the guards he
looked at bishop with this idea in
mind bishop was watching him out
of washed-out blue eyes the thin
bitter smile still curved his lips

  and besides there was tonelli the
ape-like man was lying on his stom-
ach he hadnt been listening to what
they said his face was close to some-
thing he held under his hairy paws
and he was crooning softly from deep
in his chest small squeaking noises
came from under his hands and no
wonder-he was pulling the legs off a
field mouse   

  no burch couldnt get away hed
have to string along and wait and
hope something would happen that
would give him a chance

  ridack said so you think we wont
make it does that mean youre go-
ing to get us lost

  burch had decided he said why
should i they dont pay me to risk
my neck im a ranger not a cop
thats the stuff ridack chuckled
hes a smart kid eh bishop
sure bishop agreed

  tonelli looked up and echoed
smart   

  burch stood up wed better get
going weve got to highball to get
to the pass by tomorrow evening and
youll get there-i want to live a
while yet

  ridack laughed as he slid into his
pack straps youll live kid if you
play square joe ridack always keeps
his word

  steve burch led the way off down
the trail he walked fast and the
gangsters had to struggle to keep up
it was funny burch thought what a
man could say when he had to and
the way he could act you just went
along as though nothing mattered not
even old mac getting killed-and that
hardly made sense


thrilling adventures

 burch thought the worst thing
would be telling carrie it would be
hard to tell her that he had seen her
father shot through the head-if he
ever got a chance to tell her anything
he supposed he should think of a way
to ease the shock but just then there
didnt seem to be any way he could

  well the least he could do was get
even for the old man he looked at
the three men who followed him get
even-that was funny that was very
very funny   

  it didnt occur to steve burch until
the middle of the afternoon that he
was about exhausting the men behind
him he had been in the woods all his
life-walking was part of it but
ridack and tonelli and bishop were
different

  they slogged along sucking breath
through their open mouths as though

  ridack said whats that for
keeps your head cool burch an-
swered were going to cross some
burned off land in a little while and
the sun will be blistering hot

  sounds good what kind of leaves
do you use

  any kind those there will work
ridack stripped leaves from a small
bush and put them in his hat bishop
and tonelli did the same and used
the same kind of leaves steve burch
watched them-wondering why he
didnt laugh out loud but he didnt
he pushed himself up

  lets go he said times a-wast-

  

mg

  they came to the burn in about fif-
teen minutes it was all burch had
said it would be there were no trees
only blackened stumps thrust up like
ugly hands the sun seemed to re-

next month malay massacre a

each one was the last sweat made
their faces shiny and wet but they
stood it as long as they could they
had to because it was important they
get out of the reservation early the
next evening thats when the bulk of
the fishermen would be leaving they
wouldnt be as noticeable in a crowd

  but finally ridack called a halt
gotta rest he panted we aint
used to tramping in the heat like this

  tonelli and bishop collapsed in
their tracks bishop took his shoes
off and rubbed his feet ridack
smoked and tonelli lay with his face
on the ground

  it was all right with burch theyd
made good time he realized then
thinking of the trail ahead he remem-
bered the burn that they had to cross
a forest fire had passed there and had
burned out several miles of timber

  he pulled some leaves from a near-
by bush and soaked them with his
canteen and put them in his hat

fleet off the ashes like heat from a
stove top and the dust curled up
from the slogging feet to sting their
eyes and throats

  there was heat plenty of heat and
exertion to bring the sweat cascading
down their faces

itight found them well into the
timber on the far side of the burn
the gangsters dropped exhausted
when steve burch gave the word they
did not help him make camp or cook

  the ranger stopped in his work now
and then to scratch his forehead and
curse ridack saw him said

you itchin to what causes it
no-see-ums burch answered
theyre little bugs like mosquitoes
only so small you can hardly see
them  

  they tied him up that night be-
cause as ridack said theres no use
takin chances the three gangsters
went to sleep at once-dead almost
smoke



from utter exhaustion but steve
burch lay awake

  it was a long night for him there
were so many things to think about
carrie mostly and old mac he knew
it was no good thinking that he ought
to close his mind to the whole mess
and sleep but it wasnt that easy

  so he lay there watching the moon
come up and ride across the tree tops
and somehow the night noises were a
lot of company

  ridack woke shortly after the first
light and burch was glad because
that put an end to the waiting he
squirmed around to look at the gang-
ster who started cursing first in puz-
zlement then in fear then in the
white heat of anger

  his face was no longer a face
instead it was an ugly caricature
the flesh was red and angry and swol-

tonelli said cheez boss what

happened

 can you see

 sure i can see good but what the

hell-

 ridacks voice fogged up wheres
 that damned ranger can he see
 tonelli peered at steve burch
 then he said hes tied up where we
 left him hes all right-his face aint
 a bit swollen

 thats it ridack moaned its
 those damned leaves tony find my
 hat and tell me what those leaves look
 like

theyre shiny and about medium
size

now get the rangers what are
they like

 nothin like ours theyre big and
 not shiny

 it was about all ridack could stand

jungle novel by e hoffmann price

len beyond all recognition the swell-
ing had squeezed his eyes into two
tightly closed slits

ridack pawed at them stag-
gered up blindly

  the sound of ridacks rage woke
bishop and his face was as bad or
worse than ridacks at least he was
just as blind

  tonelli grumbled and growled sleep-
ily and rolled over on his back ri-
dacks roar jerked him to his feet
there was nothing wrong with him
though his face was a little red and
swollen it wasnt enough to matter
his eyes were bright and unaffected
he looked at ridack and bishop and
swore in amazement

  bishop ridack bellowed can
you see

 god no-im blind

  tonelli where the hell are you
that damned ranger- tony answer
me

he stood there making queer choking
sounds deep in his chest none of
them meant anything really but to
steve burch they meant a lot he
had known his simple little plan had
failed when he saw tonelli

  finally ridack said bring him to
me tony leave him tied

  tonelli lifted burch and carried
him to ridack ridack fumbled for
the ranger caught his jacket and
pulled him close then his big hands
crawled upward to the rangers
throat they stopped there closed
steadily relentlessly

  burch was helpless the fingers
tightened and suddenly there was no
air to breathe he struggled feebly
but only because the desire for air
numbed his brain and made him fight
instinctively there was really no use
struggling-

  the hands released him finally but
he was beyond knowing it his world
had vanished into darkness a world


thrilling adventures

born again under the repeated impact
of tonellis hand

  dimly he heard ridack saying
wake him up wake him up hes
got to get us out of this

  hes coming out of it boss to-
nelli said

  here let me get my hands on him
ridack caught burch and dragged
him up he had to hold him because
the ranger couldnt stand alone
whatd you do to us

  burch tried to answer once and
couldnt his throat felt like it was
squeezed close finally he whis-
pered poison oak the leaves were
poison oak

  ridack whimpered and struck the
ranger across the face

tonelli picked burch up again and
carried him back to ridack ridack
said can you make us see again
no burch said theres nothing
you can do

  there has to be why didnt tony
get it

  it doesnt bother some people i
dont know why

  ridack shook burch in sudden
helpless anger theres got to be
something - youd better think of
something- he stopped suddenly
and in a different tone said would
you tell me if there was

  the ranger didnt answer

  hah ridack grunted you guys
are around that stuff all the time so
youd be sure to know a way to fix it
ill get it out of you tony here-
make it sing   

  tony freed one of the rangers
hands and held it in his own the
pressure was light at first gradually
it strengthened the ranger sank to
the ground his face became gray and
streaked with sweat

  i can do it he finally moaned

ridack said howand stopped
the pressure

  burch didnt answer till hed caught
his breath his hand didnt hurt
much it felt queer and numb but

at least he could think-he had to
think of something he said

  smoke smoke will do it thats
what we use-fir smoke

  i thought so ridack grunted
untie him tony and listen kid-
itd better work

  it will burch told him it al-
ways has

  tonelli watched burch as the
ranger built a fire and rigged a blan-
ket over it so the smoke would go in
ridacks and bishops faces and to-
nelli had a gun if it hadnt been for
that burch might have made a break
for it as it was he just fed the fire
green fir boughs and made the smoke
curl upward in a thick column

  he showed ridack and bishop
where to sit said itll take a couple
of hours before it begins to work you
got a bad dose

  ridack and bishop stood it very
well the first hour they coughed and
swore a lot but that was all tonelli
squatted on his haunches a few feet
away from burch he swiveled the
gun back and forth following the
rangers movements

  by the end of the next half hour
ridack became impatient bishop too
was complaining

  hell this aint doin any good
ridacks face was twisted horribly
under the sweat and soot it had
better work he said hoarsely by
god-it better

  and steve burch was sweating too
something had to happen pretty
quick

  then he saw the movement on the
trail

  suddenly he exploded into action
he jerked a burning branch from the
fire and threw it at tonelli

  tonelli spilled backward burch
jumped after him and kicked at the
gun the gun went flying off in the
brush

  then he yelled ridack bishop
tonelli

  ridack and bishop lurched up from
the fire ridack staggered around
smoke



with his hands outstretched bishop
screamed

 whats happened whats hap-
pened

  the kids gone crazy tony hold
him-let me get my hands on that
doublecrossin-

  burch couldnt wait to think to-
nelli was scuttfing toward him burch
tried to get away but he couldnt
tonellis big hands caught him like a
rabbit of course he fought he ham-
mered rapid futile blows into to-
nellis face

  and then he felt himself lifted and
spun in the air he tried to brace
himself for the crash against the
ground the shock left him stunned
unable to move tonelli picked him
up again and threw him down again

  a rifle cracked unexpectedly from
across the clearing

 tonelli stopped in mid-stride
clutching at his chest he knelt down
slowly finally he laid down across
the ranger slowly as if he hurt in-
side he didnt move after that-he
never moved again he was dead
tony ridack yelled tony
burch twisted to see a solitary
green-clad figure emerge from the
trees the figure moved to ridacks
side ridack stood rigid and still
the man in green laid down his rifle
with slow care he slugged ridack in

back of the jaw ridack crumpled to
the ground

  bishop was lying face down his
head covered with his hands the man
in green jerked the hands down and
bound them tightly he dragged
bishop to ridack and tied the two
together back to back in a sitting po-
sition

  then he went and lifted the lifeless
body of tonelli from steve burch
the face of the man in green was pale
and strained somehow he managed
a tight grin i dont know what
started it steve he husked but its
all over now-

  steve burch couldnt help himself
-he couldnt hold the crazy laughter
that tore at his throat and he didnt
try it felt good and it released that
horrible tightness in his stomach he
let it go and really laughed

  ridacks head rolled loosely as he
came to he muttered senselessly and
finally started cursing

  burch looked at him and giggled
and bit his lip to stop it he crawled
over to ridack and said 

  smoke to cure poison oak thats
a laugh do you know what that smoke
did it brought tom terry smoke
like that in the fire season will bring
a ranger anywhere in the district in
two hours-

  and steve burch laughed again

   dawn of reason

            concluded from page 
shudder his life spent hips and proclaimed him in their

convulsive
the lad who had done this thing stood
over him with a smile on his lips

  the tribe rushed forward in a com-
pact mass peering down at the form
on the ground with unbelieving eyes
finally several essayed to touch the
body and drew back with cries of sur-
prise when they saw that he who had
wantonly killed all his life he who
had been the terror of them all had at
last been meted out the death which
he had more than deserved with joy-
ous shouts they surged about slim

way the peer of them all and one
from whom they would learn the cor-
rect laws of life and whose leadership
they would hereafter recognize

  but he was making a wild dash for-
ward toward the cliff edge that held
long hair he must climb to her
side and once more-and for all time-
regain the maiden whom he had justly
and bravely won for the second time
through the dawn of reasoning that
had entered into his brain only that

preetings globe trotters all the
ex rest of the world may be topsy-turvy
but that old spirit of adventure that quest
for far lands and new horizons still stirs
deeply in the breasts of stout-hearted
clear-eyed men and women

  while the rest of the world sits at home
therell always be those adventurous few
envied by all disdainful of modern restric-
tions and lack of opportunity who some-
how manage to outfit themselves and set off
for any part of the globe that suits their
fancy to give weight to our point lend
your ears globe trotters to the story of
elkan j morris adventurer in the great
outdoors and his attractive young wife
anne morris  years old is a writer for
outdoor publications and an experienced
woodsman and camper his helpmate anne
is  blue-eyed has brown hair and weighs
only  pounds

  yet for the past three years this young
couple has been making overwater trips up
rivers and down lakes in the eastern part
of the country living their lives to the hilt
while gathering material for articles

          on to fort yukon
even as you read this the morrises are
now on their way overwater and by portage
to fort yukon in northwestern canadas
yukon territory they started out on the
hudson river in new york city by guide
boat their little argosy of adventure is
named the anne after mrs morris and is
equipped with an outboard motor

  young morris having already paddled
 miles on river and lake intends to
let gasoline do most of the work this time
and if you globe trotters will look at
your maps you can practically mark out
the route the morrises must take to reach
fort yukon

  they expect to get there before snowfall
and bed down for the winter in a cabin
theyll build themselves they intend to
live off the country as much as possible
regular pioneer style morris an expert
with the bow and arrow expects to bring
down small game with it to conserve the
ammunition hell have along for his two
rifles

             not just a lark
just the same adventure or no adven-
ture the morrises are not going off on just

a lark experienced campers theyre tak-
ing along full equipment-fuel and oil for
the outboard motor tent summer and win-
ter clothes sleeping bags an ax and the
usual camping supplies not to mention
such necessities as fishing tackle

  theres something almost inspiring in the
trip of this young couple no automobile
and comfortable trailer for them no expen-
sive sloop with powerful engine and sky-
blue pink sleeping quarters the morrises
are really roughing it in the old american
tradition

  and thats the great tradition of adven-
ture of striking out for far places meet-
ing danger of any sort whenever it arises
and up at the crack of dawn to push ahead
more miles into the wilderness

  to elkan j and anne morris the best
of luck friends and we hope your new
york to fort yukon trip will be the best
yet

         background for action
action and drama aplenty are crowded
into l p holmes great novel stolen
cargo featured in this issue with its ex-
citing caribbean background weve asked
author holmes to tell us about it

dear globe trotter

  i am not one of these fictioneers who have trav-
eled the far corners of the earth my life has been
pretty uneventful i was born in a mile-high gold
camp in the rockies traveled with the family to
the mother lode gold country of california and
spent some early years there then proceeded to
grow up on a cattle ranch

   ive never been in an airplane the highest i ever
flew being from the back of a bronc or two that
were a little too salty for me to handle when they
decided to come undone ive hunted and camped
and fished pretty much all through this neck of
the woods and live out in the sticks now

   ive never sailed the raging sea nor fought head-
hunters in a jungle nor shot down hun planes
over france though one editor got the idea that
i must have after buying a flock of war-air yarns
from me

  for my yarn stolen cargo i laid the setting
in the west indies because it lent itself to the plot
the dog rocks are real enough being between the
southern tip of florida and cuba southeast of the
dry tortugas were i a sea story writer i think
id look into the west indies and the bahamas
the windward and the leeward islands

  that caribbean sea area must be crammed with
romance and stories maybe one of the boys will
get smart one of these days and dig in there
giving us some yarns to counterbalance the more
usual south sea islands locale

  as for myself im pretty much of a confirmed
western writer for ive lived that life and i know
the country-and i like it id rather wake up
there under a dawn sky with the smell of sage-


the globe trotter



 brush and dew-dampened tarweed in my nostrils
 than any other place i know

   in my eyes there is no view to match the blue
 and lavender bulk of lonely mountains against a
 biinset sky or dawn coming up over some west-
 ern desert ill take mine up on a good bronc
 with a rifle under my knee and plenty of open
 bky to wander under or up to my hips with the
 white water of a good trout stream when the rain-
 bows or steelheads are hitting

   and i can really live when the fall winds are
 blowing and the ducks are flying and i can hunker
 down in a tule blind with the little springer pup
 beside me and smell the breath of the marsh
 and then that never-to-be-forgotten thrill when the
 shadowy bulk of a big mule deer buck goes crash-
 ing out of a jackpine thicket

   or perhaps on one of those warm still days
 about a waterhole when the wild doves go hurtling
 by like feathered bullets or a frosty morning in
 early winter when the quail are calling plaintively
 from the glistening manzanitas that is my life
 and ill stick to it

sincerely

                                   l p holmes

   and as long as men like l p holmes
 love and are themselves a part of the west
 readers will not go lacking for adventure
 and western yarns of real warmth and
 color a man who knows how to live this
 l p holmes and we think that his letter
 shows it

young adventurers attention

   the very first letter we opened this
 morning stirred up memories of a gone
 but decidedly not forgotten youth and
 made us wish we were back in slacks and
 tennis shoes ready for come what may

   for this letter is an invitation to high
 adventure-a call to two young men with
 a little cash on hand and two free years
 ahead of them to cast off from shore and
 set sail in a -foot sloop on a cruise to
 ports far and near

 dear globe trotter

   i have just finished reading my copy of
 thrilling adventures and it was a corker
 believe me

   your globe trotters cltjb is a great idea
 and it should help to bring travelers closer to-
 gether

   but before i go on let me introduce myself
 my name is james carson and ive traveled quite
 a bit in the last few years all over this country
 canada mexico and the americas in fact

   right now my buddy and i are working to
 finance another trip we own a -foot frenchmen
 sloop which we bought a while back and theres
 not another like her in this part of the coast

   she is a sail and motor sloop combined and
 shes great to look at if you like ships

    what we intend to do in the near future is some
 tall traveling to far-away ports and islands to
 take motion picture film shots with our own cam-
 era and get in some good fishing and hunting

    now if there are two fellows among your read-
 ers who would like to go with us why we would
 be glad to have them come along and if you can
 help us find these two fellows we would be most
 grateful

    of course they will have to do their share of the
  work the first fellow must be able to operate a
  motion picture camera and know what to do with
  it the second fellow must know how to cook and
  be able to handle a boat a little

    both fellows must not be over  years of age
 but over  also they must help to finance the
 trip a little although not much cash is needed
 we have to buy food and such other supplies as
 well need on the cruise

   the two fellows who want to go along with us
 can be sure that theyll be in for a lot of fun and
 thrills but nobody with a weak heart and an un-

they still play rough

  anson hard whose exciting novelet
 knives of the jungle is a feature
 of this issue has a very interesting letter
 for us about the philippine background of
 his story having lived and taught among
 the natives out there wed say he knows
 what hes talking about

 dear globe trotter

   once when traveling in mindanao i asked direc-
 tions from a native and his answer was follow
 the mud he meant of course the trails which
 were knee-deep in mud his terse answer explains
 one of the reasons why central mindanao is a prac-
 tically unknown land

   bain is a daily occurrence in this country and
 the trails even on the slopes and peaks of the
 mountains are deep in mud travel is reduced to
 a mile an hour by carabao or water buffalo and
 no region with such difficult transportation has
 ever been developed or completely explored large
 sections of mindanao are still marked unex-
 plored oh the map

   this central region is inhabited by wild or un-
 civilized tribes of manoboes and ates and by the
 moros the two former peoples are pagans and
 the latter mohammedans they have never been
 completely disciplined by military forces it is a
 region tn which a traveler must go armed

  my story knives of the jungle is built
 around a real character datu inda who led just
 such a pillaging band as has been depicted in the
 yarn his general ranging ground was in north-
 ern cotabato and southern bukidnon provinces
 along the pulangi biver he was still at large on
 my last visit to mindanao several years ago and
 may still be at his depredations i have never
 read any report that he has been killed or captured

   he is no creature of fiction as i know from
 actual observation i have passed through the
 charred remains of villages that he had looted and
 burned and came within two hours of catching
 up with him once in southern bukidnon his
 knowledge of the mountains made it well-nigb
 impossible to corral him with military forces and
 the tribesmen not actually in his band held him in
 such fear that they would never divulge his where
 abouts

   the region is extraordinarily wild a few years
 ago a scientific party scaled mount apo in centra
 mindanao in the hope of finding the missing link
 between the ape and the human being mindanao
 ranks along with borneo as a land of mystery
 the native pagan tribes are ranked by the govern
 ment as lower in the scale of civilization than the
 head-hunting igorotes of luzon they battle with
 long-bladed fighting spears bolos and krises
 many of them live in tree houses

   to turn a trail suddenly and come upon these
 warriors long wooden shields over their arms
 spears in hand and every mouth so betel-stained
 that it looks like a gaping wound is to believe

 their imps if these warriors are in a friendly
 mood a mah-yad-gul-lee which is the bukidnon

mouths grinning if they are not friendly it is
better to throw off the safety catch on your rifle

  the philippine constabulary officered by both
white and native men has done yeoman service
in keeping the tribes peaceful the long distances
of unsettled country between the constabulary
posts on the north side of mindanao and those on
the south side make complete police service im-
possible but only when these mountain robbers or
magahats have a daring leader like datu inda
can they continue depredations for any length of
time

  while these magahats try to elude the soldiers
brisk encounters do take place i was in one that
was pretty hot for an hour-and im not talking
about the weather as depicted in my yarn
knives of the jungle these mountain boys
have a pretty decent respect for the contabularys
springfield rifle

  like the hero of the yarn phil logan many of
the constabulary officers are promoted from the
u s regulars in fact the constabulary was or-

fanized at the beginning by an american soldier
n phil logan i have tried to characterize the
qualities of these officers who have come from the
regulars over to the constabulary

  theyre scrappers the job has never been one
for faint-hearted men

very sincerely

anson hard

  we can think of much nicer things than
meeting up with a bevy of pre-civilization
head-hunters mr hard particularly in a
damp and steaming jungle guess those
men in the philippine constabulary earn
their pay and thats no joke

the fangs of otan that latest
story of yours in this issue

dear globe trotter

  this globe trotter department of thrilling
adventures is i think a darn good idea it
gives the author an opportunity to meet his read-
ers on more intimate ground it also gives the
writer an opportunity to disclose some of the
basic facts of color and action about which his
yarns are written

take the fangs of otan in tluj present
issue how come weil let me digress please

  id like you to go back some years and visualize
a youngster pretty much alone in the wilderness
thats me and a pretty empty wilderness it was
since we were almost the first settlers in the dis-
trict a young boy just out of an old country
school thrust right into the heart of the wilds
can get mighty lonely very suddenly

  some kind settlers gave me a little cocker
spaniel puppy which became my constant com-
panion but as i was obliged to leave our home-
stead and go out to work for distant neighbors
jack the spaniel had to be left at home and
wasnt receiving just the treatment i would have
given him a lady one of the first women in the
district took compassion on little jack and offered
a telescope to me in trade for him

  reluctantly i parted with jack i had something
which next to a gun i prized very highly and
at once set it to work with that telescope i was
able to see clearly for long distances i was able
to pick out animal life that could not be seen with
the naked eye i discovered i had an imagination
and a heart that yearned for adventure

  and so in my spare time i roamed through the
forest trekking far afield and since the district
was so sparsely settled i quickly discovered how
plentiful was the wild animal life

  occasionally i killed a deer for food and often
had to trap for a livelihood but always i have
been a friend of the wild things one thing that
struck me more than anything else while observ-
ing the habits of the forest denizens was their
wisdom the great love of the wilderness mothers
for their young i have seen some great demon-
strations of valiance on the part of wild life parents
in defense of their young from the tiny field
mouse to the handsome formidable buck deer

  many times in my fiction stories i have used
the cougar as tlfe villain realizing at the same
time that in all the wilds there is no more devoted
parent than the she-cougar and so in the
fangs of otan i decided to feature the sagac-
ity and devotion of otan the mother cougar in
tribute to the real courage of this animal

sincerely yours

harold f cruickshank

 thanks for your letter cruick and we
expect to see another northwoods yarn
from you in the mail for us any day now

our next issue

 we dont see how we can get too
enthusiastic about the next issue of
thrilling adventures for sep-
tember all in one issue were bringing
together a trio of genuine adventure-fiction
aces-e hoffmann price captain j

culley

  leading off will be e hoffmann prices
hangup novel of jungle revolt-malay
massacre death and disaster in a land
of struggle and treachery where life-
even a white mans-is cheap and the devil
counts coup

ing on and no signs of an armistice cap-
tain j winchcombe-taylor has contrived
another yarn of bare knuckles and tough
situations for that ace of he-men club
fist mayne guerrillas for
the globe trotter



china is the story and its a grand nov-
elet 

 while johnston mcculleys found in
far places a river of death story
will keep you glued to your chair with its
suspense and drama

  not to mention our usual roster of short
stories and special features all with color
and a punch to them but wait-theres
more to come

our adventure writers

  we figured out the other day that it
would be a good idea to have you globe
trotters meet the men who write our ad-
venture yarns for us year in and year out
men who are aces in the adventure-fiction
field and whose own lives are surely as
colorful as the characters they write about

  our authors thought it was a good idea
too and in answer to our request letters
and photographs began coming in with each
mail and so with the september issue
thrilling adventures begins the
first in a series of biographical sketches
entitled they write as they live

issue will carry the story of that doughty

foot

send coupon
dont pay until relieved

according to the government health bul-
letin no e- at least  of the adult
population of the united states are being
attacked by the disease known as athletes
foot

usually the disease starts between the toes
little watery blisters form and the skin cracks
and peels after a while the itching becomes
intense and you feel as though you would like
to scratch off all the skin

beware of it spreading

often the disease travels all over the bot-
tom of the feet the soles of your feet be-
come red and swollen the skin also cracks
and peels and the itching becomes worse and
worse

get relief from this disease as quickly as pos-
sible because it is very contagious and it may
go to your hands or even to the under arm or
crotch of the legs

 heres how to relieve it

  the germ that causes the disease is known
as tinea trichophyton it buries itself deep
in the tissues of the skin and is very hard
to kill a test made shows it takes  min-
utes of boiling to kill the germ so you
can see why the ordinary surface remedies are
unsuccessful

  h f was developed solely for the pur-
pose of relieving athletes foot it is a
liquid that penetrates and dries quickly
you just paint the affected parts it peels
off the tissue of the skin where the germ
breeds

  itching stops quickly

  when you apply h f you should find
that the itching is quickly relieved you
should paint the infected parts with h f
night and morning until your feet are better
usually this takes from three to ten days
although in severe cases be sure to consult a
specialist

  h f should leave the skin soft and smooth
you may marvel at the quick way it brings
you relief especially if you are one of those
who have tried for years to get rid of athletes
foot without success

  sign and mail the coupon and a bottle
of h f will be mailed you immediately
dont send any money and
dont pay the postman any
