 caroline lockhart has written several novels that sold widely and were appreciated for their insight character drawing and vitality her field is the west of to-day with its vast reaches of mountain plain and desert and its people as big
       hearted and clean as all out-of-doors
       no story of hers has achieved greater
       heights than that which opens in the
       next popular magazine on sale
       august th entitled

the man from the bitter roots
cl-	-my

two weeks ago we bad something to
say about old authors and new
ones we said that we would hold on
to the old authors and print everything
they wrote provided it was worthy of
them and of the magazine and that we
would seek out and welcome the new
wherever they were to be found just
by way of making good on the last re-
mark we now announce a new four-part
story by a new writer-new at least to
the pages of the popular the story
is called the man from the bitter
roots and the author is caroline lock-
hart author of me-smith which was
a best seller a number of years ago

 

tmi is new story fell into our hands
more or less by accident it had
been written with book publication in
mind sometimes we go after a thing
and get it and have some little reason
perhaps for feeling elated over the per-
formance and sometimes on the other
hand the lesson seems to be brought
home to us that there is such a thing
as ordinary old-fashioned bull luck
the hunter may track the deer all day
and fail-only to see the flash of a white
tail where he least expected it the fish-
erman may whip a stream for hours
with not a bite and another time a
random cast in the tinlikeliest pool may
bring him the biggest of the season
being ready and awake to the opportu-
nity of course has something to do with
it vigilance and stubborn optimism
under the most unpromising circum-
stances are the tributes we must bear if

we want the smiles of fortune we
knew enough to read the unpromising-
looking stack of battered manuscript
when we found it and to hold on to it
after we read it and now having
given due consideration to these moral
maxims and philosophical reflections we
will proceed to weigh the fish to meas-
ure the horns of the buck

	a

vihen you read the man from the
bitter roots you will realize
that it is one of the best long stories that
has ever appeared in this magazine we
say this with consideration and with
the memory of many great stories if
it had been written to our order it could
not have met our ideas better and few
stories written to order have ever had
so much spirit atmosphere and dynamic
energy it is the life story of a strong
man we see him first as a boy with a
strong definite character struggling in-
stinctively with harsh circumstances a
child taking a mad race across thirty
miles of prairie only to find his mother
on her deathbed the first chapter of
the book is the only one devoted to his
boyhood but in that chapter we can read
the character and something perhaps
of the future of the man that is to be
we know that he may be killed but
never really defeated we find him next
in a lonely cabin with a half-mad com-
panion working on a mine in the wilder-
ness of the bitter roots the same
boy grown to be a young man big and
strong sane and patient and courageous
with the same kindness and tenderness
  a chat with you-continued

for dumb animals the same placid de-
termination the light that night in the
cabin the death of his companion the
snowstorm that follows and isolates
them from all the world are things easy
to read but hard to forget the swift-
changing scenes of that night flash vivid
and unforgetable like a landscape shown
to us by intermittent flares of lightning
the blizzard closes in and they are
alone apparently separated from all the
world the dead and the living in the
little cabin but other actors in the
drama are moving toward them across
the white ridges of the ritter roots a
city sportsman hunting rocky moun-
tain sheep his guide and his chinese
cook are cut off by the storm to reach
the cabin is their only chance and the
guide finally reaches it these are the
opening chapters of the first big install-
ment the opening action that prepares
for the drama that is to follow the
city sportsman the guide who is a great
character even the chinaman are to play
their parts in it they are little figures
brought together in the wilderness of
snowy peaks by the hand of fate their
conflicting characters are to react upon
each other in the development of a great
story

a a

tii ere are other actors in the drama
 other men and women and one girl
of whom we especially like to think as
we review the story we have said
enough about it we dont want to spoil
it for you it happens all in four big
dramatic acts with a number of scenes
in each act and you will have it all in
two months we read so many manu-

scripts here that sometimes we think
that asking us to read a story as a treat
is like trying to be nice to a letter car-
rier by taking him out for a good long
walk and yet we think we would like
to read the man from the bitter
roots again perhaps we will

a a

o	peaking of the older writers we
have all of us remembered happily
some of the novels of fred bechdolt
he hasnt been in the popular for
some time but it is not his fault nor
ours novels such as you are accus-
tomed to read in the popular do not
grow overnight in any mans mind
theres another bechdolt novel how-
ever full length to appear complete in
the issue of the popular out two weeks
from to-day forty miles from no-
where it is called and it is a story of
the oil business we dont say as much
about it as about the man from bitter
roots not because it isnt worth it but
because you know bechdolt well and
what to expect from him

  gold and oil arc not everything in life
and there arc other activities to be read
about in the next issue there is a
rousing story of an automobile racer by
frank condon there is a story of the
real-estate business by holworthy hall
there k a story of the egg business by
hamby who can make even an egg seem
romantic and there is a story of the
navy by clarence cullen who knows
how to write about the navy partly be-
cause he was in it only a few of the
things in the next number but surely
they are enough to stir your interest just
a little

    a complete novel

chapter i

the triumvirate celebrate an
auspicious occasion

a trio of young men occupy-
ing a conspicuous center table
had become the cynosure of all
eyes in fashionable augerots
cabaret that night and the climax came
when their leader who looked the
youngest of three insisted upon tak-
ing the floor to the strains of the
latest musical hit and executing prob-
ably the most fantastic one-step broad-
way had ever witnessed he was part-
nered by one of his companions a fat
pink-cheeked gentleman

  in the midst of this exhibition the
manager appeared conscious of an un-
pleasant duty and spoke a word in
ib

private whereupon the leader of the
triumvirate ceased his terpsichorean
efforts clapped the other familiarly on
the back and then turning addressed
the assembled company

  your pardon ladies and gentle-
men everybodys pardon hebegan
with a most infectious if rather un-
steady laugh no offense intended
i assure you my friends and i are
merely celebrating a most auspicious
occasion most auspicious i assure you
-a fool and his money being soon
parted ladies and gentlemen let us
drink to the sentiment and heedless
of masculine scowls he raised an empty
champagne glass which slipped from
his grasp and shivered to atoms on the
floor

  in a far corner a girl was dining


the popular magazine

alone for the moment and now as the
triumvirate shepherded by the diplo-
matic manager made their flowery exit
and the commotion died down she sat
staring at the closed door

  her escort joined her presently
the management should know better
than to admit a crowd like that he
exclaimed and if it had been any
one but that fellow and his friends
theyd have been fired out long ago
neck and crop lorimer thinks be-
cause he has a fools license he can
get away with any nonsense
lorimer echoed the girl is
that his name i mean the one who
made the speech and seemed the leader
do you know him

  her companion shrugged i know
of him and so would you if you were
a new yorker hes known from the
st denis to the plaza and back again
his wild escapades have been news-
paper talk for years

  he didnt look the typical fool
said the girl who were the other
two 

  oh a couple of the same stripe
the one who looked as if hed been
blown up to eighty pounds pressure is
fatty stuveysant the other morti-
mer conyers he at least is old
enough to know better i dont know
much about him except that hes a
rounder and travels with lorimer and
stuveysant prodigals all thats the
best you can say of them

  prodigals all murmured the girl
a far-away look in her eyes and two
of them so young

  meanwhile the triumvirate home-
ward bound had picked up a mutual
friend-billy wate sporting writer on
the new york star-and now in his
bachelor quarters lorimer was en-
deavoring to explain the evenings en-
tertainment

  the grand final blow-out of the
season he grinned the triumphant

passing of the fool and his money
my friend

  do you mean that youre ruined
exclaimed wate

  absolutely my dear boy put in
stuveysant behold three ruined
prodigals gaze upon the impressive
scene of course conyers was more
or less ruined anyway but its a new
and diverting experience for rummy
lorimer and me for you must know
my dear boy that ive just completed
the circle of love which consists in
being kicked out the front door by an
irate father taken in the back door by
a doting mother and kicked out the
front door again by the aforesaid
father in other words my allowance
has been amputated at the root the
parental roof has been forbidden me
and like hagar of old ive been cast
forth into the wilderness where the
whangdoodle mourneth for his first-
born hence these tears and mr
stuveysant helped himself to another
high ball

  serves you right said billy wate
i only wonder the aforesaid parent
didnt do it long ago if you were my
child youd never have had a chance
to grow a stomach like that that
facade of yours fatty is an outstand-
ing affront to all honest hard-working
citizens and a horrible example to the
young

  he turned with some show of con-
cern to lorimer

  is it straight goods harry are
you really down and out a quarter
of a million in two years

  behold the remains harry lori-
mer turned out his pockets and flipped
some greenbacks on the table bird-
seed thats all yes a quarter of a
million in two years going some eh
i never was a piker billy

  no said wate slowly pikers
never finish this way have you
thought of what youll do

  lorimer laughed no i havent
the cpcrooigl



the least idea im not a brainy hard-
working disciple like you with my daily
bread at my finger tips but come
this is a celebration not a funeral
fill up your glasses boys and drink
to the auspicious occasion

  a serving mn entered he wore a
chronic air of disapproval and an-
swered to the name of jukes

  beg pardon sir but that fellow is
here again he announced dismally
regarding the scene of inane revelry
with a look of patient disgust that
fellow magee sir you said never to
send him away without something sir
oh magee lorimer pondered a
moment well send him in here
jukes

  in here sir

  yes why not

  but-but sir the fellows impos-
sible  quite impossible sir a dead

beat-

  show him in jukes

  mr magee entered preceded by the
serving man who held his nose in the
air as if under great compulsion he
were ushering in a bad smell

  mr magee proved to be a shortish
broadish gentleman with a round
black head like a cannon ball a pair
of broken knuckles and immense
hands mud-colored eyes a scar on the
starboard angle of his lean progna-
thous jaw and a small aperture at the
corner of his twisted mouth through
which when he condescended to speak
his voice emerged with all the modu-
lation and tunefulness of a factory
whistle to these minor attractions
may be added a slight impediment in
his gait mr magee was dressed shab-
bily and inadequately smelled of
ancient hops and was obviously none
too well acquainted with soap and
water

lorimer arose and nodded genially
well met mr magee gentlemen
permit me to introduce mr magee a

victim of adverse fortune like our-
selves

  the visitor looked as if he suspected
himself of being the victim of rather
an elaborate joke

  aw say he murmured sepul-
chrally rubbing his large hands aw
say these two words were the most
frequently used in the magee vocabu-
lary and could convey the most vary-
ing emotions

  have a drink mr magee said
lorimer fill up your glass and drink
to the auspicious occasion

  this proved to be a happy inspira-
tion apparently the phrase of all
others which mr magee thoroughly
understood and had no cause to dis-
trust for after but a momentary hes-
itation he helped nimself quite liber-
ally and raising his glass and address-
ing the company generally with the
salutation down the brook he shot
the contents into his capacious maw
with admirable grace and precision
after which drawing a threadbare
sleeve politely across his lips he stood
at ease and seemed quite ready to
oblige with a second performance

  and now added lorimer the
next question is a little loan eh

  aw say murmured mr magee

  well continued lorimer im
sorry-for my own sake as well as
yours mr magee-but youve just
drunk to the last occasion of the kind
the fact of the matter is im broke
-dead broke i mention this trivial
circumstance merely to save you the
trouble of any future visits after
to-morrow this hospitable roof will
cease to exist so far as im concerned
in the meantime please accept this
parting remembrance with my bless-
ing he laughed gayly took the col-
lection of birdseed from the table
-the last insignificant ignoble rem-
nant of his fortune-and tendered it
to the visitor

  that gentleman looked from the


the vovulacr magaznb

rumpled bills to their owner and back
again varying emotions depicted in his
little eyes at length he shook his
round black cannon-ball head

 aw say-nix boss nothin

doin-

  go on urged lorimer take it
i want you to take it

  mr magee shuffled his feet and
stretched out a hand only to draw
it back he seemed to be groping for
words

  nothin doin boss he repeated
youre a dead-game sport mr lori-
mer you sure are but i aint the kind
to take a guys last cent see say
youve been mighty good to me and i
dont forget it i didnt know you was

goin broke-im sorry-

  as if suddenly overwhelmed at find-
ing himself talking at such length mr
magee stopped short nodded the can-
non-ball head several times and limped
precipitately from the room leaving
lorimer staring at the money a strange
look in his eyes

  who is that fellow asked wate
as the door closed behind the visitor
his handsome map seemed a bit fa-
miliar i felt i should know it

  hes a broken-down ex-profes-
sional ball player explained lorimer
used to play with the albany ves-
pers about ten years ago he was
some backstop too though the team
wasnt much good

 bud magee exclaimed wate
thats the fellow i remember see-
ing him before the vespers blew up
what do you know about the old ves-
pers of the inter-state league any-
way 

 not much answered lorimer
ive an uncle who lives in albany
and years ago i used to visit him a
good bit he was always a fan and
in fact owns a minor-league team to
this day i guess he has made a for-
tune out of the game well a a kid
i saw the vespers play in albany

  and when this fellow magee came
along with a hard-luck story-why of
course rummy fell for it put in
conyers disgustedly the fellows a
dead beat and drinks every cent he begs
why his breath smelled like a brew-
ery 

  well dear boy your own breath is
nothing to brag about said fatty
stuveysant why quarrel with a
mans drink no doubt mr magee
would prefer to smell like a distillery
if he could afford it

  here jukes entered with a letter and
the murmured explanation came in
the last delivery sir

  lorimer eyed it with misgiving
another remembrance from a cred-
itor i suppose he grinned you
never know how many people are
thinking of you until you go broke
then the postmark caught his eye
and his expression changed you
fellows will excuse me wont you
he exclaimed tearing open the envel-
ope

  he glanced through the letter then
gave a whoop upset the table and be-
gan a war dance about the room
then while the others eyed him
amazed he became very solemn though
his eyes if not his feet still danced

  gentlemen he said gravely i re-
gret to announce that a rich uncle

has just died making me his heir-

  hooray bellowed stuveysant
did you ever hear of such bull
luck exclaimed conyers starting up
from the couch where he had been
half asleep blow in one fortune and
grab another of all the luck catch
any one dying and leaving me anything
but bad debts

  wate whistled incredulously how
much is it this time harry

i dont know replied lorimer
you fellows havent given me a
chance to explain it seems-but
heres the letter read it for yourself
his three companions clubbed heads
the prodigal



over the letter wate reading aloud
it was from a firm of albany lawyers
and stated briefly that silas q lorimer
had died suddenly it concluded

  the palestine baseball club owned by our
late client has been bequeathed to you un-
conditionally but the rest of the estate real
and personal left in part conditionally what
those conditions are can be best explaintd in
an interview kindly call on us at your earli-
est convenience yours truly

owen  atkins

  conditionally said billy wate
scratching his head u-m-m i dont
like that word it may mean anything
or nothing

  palestine ejaculated stuveysant
who ever heard of em playing ball
in the holy land

  palestine you fathead is a small
jerkwater dump near albany put in
conyers

  lorimer nodded ive never been
in the town but my uncle was born
there this is the uncle i was speak-
ing about i told you fellows i used
to visit him a good bit when i was
young but there was a family row of
some sort and its all of a dozen years
since i last saw him so i neednt
pretend to be heartbroken at his death
say whats a ball team worth billy
anywhere from a fortune to thirty
cents grinned wate i never heard
of this palestine club but if its a
first-class county team drawing a good
steady gate the franchise may be worth
as much as twenty-five thousand
mind thats only a guess and the thing
for you to do is go up there and find
out

  sure agreed stuveysant and
the sooner the better rummy

  of course stuveysant and i will
go along as a sort of advisory com-
mittee added conyers generously
you dont know the first thing about

embarrassment i want to warn you

veysants all right hes a different

chapter ii

  a fine juicy lemon to suck

  mr gabriel owen senior member
of the albany law firm of owen 
atkins pulled his lambs wool whiskers
and blinked solemnly over his specta-


the cpopulacr magazine

cles he was not very favorably im-
pressed with the appearance of mr
henry lorimer-known to broadway
by the delectable name of rummy-
only and beloved nephew of the late
silas q lorimer nor if the truth
were known was that young gentle-
man impressed with it himself he
was guiltily conscious that his eyes
were congested and that despite his
customary scrupulous grooming he
bore this morning all the unmistakable
earmarks of a prodigal

  the estate mr owen was say-
ing exclusive of the baseball inter-
ests is valued at about three hundred
thousand

  lorimers first impulse was to let
out a whoop for this sum exceeded his
rosiest imaginings instead remem-
bering his supposed state of mourn-
ing he preserved his attitude of mel-
ancholy decorum

  half the estate continued the old
lawyer is left conditionally to your
late uncles ward miss sands of oil
city pennsylvania

 w-what stuttered lorimer
w-whats that his ward why-
why i never knew he had a ward
nevertheless she exists replied
mr owen who appeared to be taking
a subdued pleasure in the interview

  as we suggested in our letter he
proceeded smoothly half the estate is
left to you conditionally-under the
same conditions as those applying to
our late clients ward those condi-
tions arc that you and miss sands be-
come man and wife if either of you
are to profit from the estate by so
much as a penny this of course is
excepting the baseball property which
is yours unconditionally at the end
of five years dating from the day of
your uncles death if the terms of the
bequest are not complied with the es-
tate is to be realized and the entire
proceeds given to charity

  having exploded this bombshell suc-

cessfully mr owen leaned back
pulled his lambs wool whiskers and
contemplated the effect that effect
was plainly visible for lorimer sat
open-mouthed and in a state bordering
on stupefaction

  there is one more item added the
lawyer the lorimer homestead in
palestine where your uncle was born
and where after his removal to the
city he lived occasionally is left un-
conditionally to miss sands

  but this is preposterous ex-
claimed lorimer finding tongue at
last im to get one hundred and
fifty thousand if i marry somebody i
never saw in all my born days and
shes to get the same in other words
were to sell ourselves were to be
forced into a loveless marriage merely
to obey the whim of an eccentric old

man-

  theres no compulsion in the mat-
ter sir corrected mr owen mildly
you can simply refuse

  of course i refuse exclaimed lor-
imer hotly i need money but not so
badly as all that ill marry when i
please and whom i please and i refuse
to be dictated to in such a matter by
any one above ground or-or under-
ground so far as im concerned-and
no doubt i also speak for miss sands
-that three hundred thousand may be
given to charity at once and not five
years from now i dont want any
part of it

  for the first time the old lawyer
looked at mr henry lorimer with
some dawning approval though it was
tempered by the cynical suspicion of
the man of the world

  your sentiments are admirable sir
he said dryly but you will have five
years in which to change them i may
add however that miss sands has
taken the same attitude as yourself
any decent girl would retorted
lorimer if my uncle had wished
to keep this miss sands and me from
the prodigal



knowing each other if he had wished
to make us thoroughly dislike each
other he couldnt have hit on a bettor
way than this its a wonder to me
any lawyer would draw up such a
will

  the will sir is legal in every re-
spect replied mr owen with asper-
ity youll discover that if you at-
tempt to contest it your uncle may
have been a little eccentric toward the
last but there never was a question
of his absolute sanity a man can dis-
pose of his estate as he pleases sir
and his lawyer isnt responsible for
whatever disposition he makes

  i apologize mr owen if i sug-
gested anything of a personal nature
by what i said remarked lorimer
i didnt mean to i assure you you
must make some allowance for a man
who has just lost three hundred thou-
sand as for attempting to break the
will that never entered my head i
think i may be permitted to call it ec-
centric but at all events i dont at-
tempt to question its validity or that
obvious truth that my uncle had a per-
fect right to do whatever he liked with
his money

  the approving look deepened in mr
owens shrewd old eyes and he ap-
peared considerably mollified

  this he said almost kindly tak-
ing a long envelope from a tin deed
box contains papers relative to the
palestine baseball club the deed to
lorimer park and mortgage of same
also a communication from your late
uncle

  further red tape being wound up
satisfactorily lorimer shook hands
with mr gabriel owen and took his
leave

   some time later in their suite in the
ten eyck hotel he permanently in-
terrupted messrs conyers and stu-
veysants game of pinochle by the ac-
count of his visit to the lawyers the
bombshell exploding among this new

audience with all the success of its ini-
tial effort

  suffering mackerel gasped stu-
veysant collapsing on the bed why
were ruined all over again what
are you laughing at rummy  wheres
the joke

  well whats the use of bleating
grinned lorimer ive only lost
something i never had

  are you fellows crazy put in con-
yers where does the losing come
in dont you as good as get the three
hundred thousand if you marry the
girl-for she gets the other half well
then what more do you want of
course your refusal to the lawyer was
only a grand-stand play

  was it asked lorimer youve
got another think coming mort

  do you mean to say youre going to
turn it down demanded the other in-
credulously in the name of common
sense why

  because im not for sale snapped
lorimer with his first show of anger
i may be a waster but im no huck-
ster i wont marry for the sole sake
of money no matter how great the
amount or my necessity and you can
paste that in your little brown hat i
dont want any part of my uncles
money under such conditions and that
settles it

  well all i can say is that youre
a monumental ass observed conyers
bitterly stuveysant however had
looked his silent approval we came
up here expecting to fall into a for-
tune and all we get is a ball team that
maynt be worth funeral expenses

   i bet its worth a fortune declared
stuveysant confidently theres big
money in the game and i know a fel-
low that pulled half a million out of
it

  he never pulled half a million out
of the bushes unless he sunk a couple
of million at the start sneered con-
yers


the cpocpulacr magazine

  while they were arguing this point
a bell boy came in with a letter for
lorimer it was from wate written
the previous evening from the star
office and ran in part as follows

  from what i can figure out your ball team
known to fame as the invincibles are a bunch
of sand-lotters and the franchise worth
about thirty cents in bad money theyre in
the county league and have finished last for
the past three seasons theyre known as the
cellar champions and the hashhouse jn-
vincibles-from the way they scramble the
eggs and spill the beans it looks to me as
if your late uncle were something of a hu-
morist and had left you a fine juicy lemon
to suck

  ill try to run up and look things over so
dont do anything definite till i see you

  a harrowing silence succeeded the
public reading of this epistle

  ruined for the third time ex-
claimed stuveysant tragically of all
the dam miserable rotten luck-

  i told you so said conyers in
gloomy triumph i just knew theyd
pan out a bunch of sand-lotters the
hashhouse invincibles how does it
feel rummy to be a bloated baseball
capitalist-

  oh forget it said lorimer
whats the good of croaking im
going up to this holy land and find
out for myself just how bad things
are

  if we can even sell the franchise for
car fare home exclaimed stuveysant
hopefully

  sell it sneered conyers why
youll have to pay somebody to take
it away a fine juicy lemon to suck

chapter iii

a visit to the office

  palestine proved to be hardly de-
serving of the title bestowed on it by
conyers for it was a thriving if some-
what old-fashioned town and not with-
out some claim to history and distinc-
tion conyers however with that vast
contempt of a certain type of new

yorker for anything not daubed with
the broadway brand of paint affected
to sneer at its unmistakable air of
rurality evidenced by the long quiet
shady avenues and wooden houses

  lorimer had engaged rooms in the
empire house the towns most am-
bitious hotel and he now left conyers
and stuveysant and set off for the
palestine baseball club which he
learned had an office on upper main
street in a building known locally as
the lorimer block

  he boarded an uptown trolley find-
ing a place on the back seat beside a
gentleman whose general plan of archi-
tecture may be best described as gan-
gling he was big-jointed and
loosely packed with a long blushing
neck like a turkey cock and an ill-
favored jaw that kept munching a wad
of gum with irritating persistence he
was evidently something of a local
celebrity for the conductor spoke to
him with familiarity

  hello clark he was saying
anything doing yet heard whos
got the invincibles

  i hear its the old mans nephew
replied mr clark shortly one of
these tinhorn sports from new
york

  didnt know he had a nephew ob-
served the conductor i spose hell
sell the franchise

  sell it laughed the other why
you couldnt give it away whos
sucker enough to hold the bag
well said the other defensively
i heard that pete delaney didnt think
so worse of it at that

  piffle pete delaney aint the kind
to ask to have a tin can tied to him
he wont buy the franchise and the
guy who does ought to have his head
examined

  lorimer located without difficulty the
headquarters of the palestine baseball
club in a ground-floor office of the
lorimer block a substantial building
the cprodigl



of modern design the plate-glass
window bore the following legend
philander jellibond notary public
bonds mortgages deeds insurance
he opened the door and found him-
self to his surprise in a well-appointed
office a small fraction of this was
railed off and behind this railing a
girl was typewriting industriously so
industriously that she seemed unaware
of his entrance she was dressed in
black with a wide turndown collar
which afforded lorimer an excellent
view of an extremely white and pretty
neck topped by a mop of amber-col-
ored hair

  he waited patiently then finally went
forward and leaned over the railing
good morning he said affably i
hope my-er-waiting isnt disturbing
you

  the little stenographer jumped and
swung around i-i beg your par-
don she exclaimed flushing vividly
i thought you were mr jellibond
she arose quite self-possessed and
assumed a prim businesslike air that
sat strangely on one of her obvious
youth what can i do for you sir
if you wish to see mr jellibond he

isnt here yet-

  but i dont know if i want to see
mr jellibond confessed lorimer in-
genuously if he happens to have
anything to do with the palestine base-
ball club-

  hes the business manager

  then ill wait till he comes in
you see its this way he added al-
most apologetically i happen to own

the club-

  oh then you are the late mr lori-
mers nephew

  exactly and you may i ask

  i am miss walker the stenogra-
pher

  he raised his hat and made her a
very polite bow they looked for a
moment at each other in silence and
then entirely without cause both sud-

denly smiled-the smile with which
youth hails youth the world over

  well miss walker said lorimer
im looking for somebody who can
tell me something about the palestine
baseball club perhaps you can

oblige me-

  i dont know mr lorimer ill
try im sure but you see ive only
been here two days the regular
stenographer got married and left and
through the kind influence of miss
sands i secured the position though
knowing it might be only temporary
so you see ive only been here two
days and my predecessor-well things
seem to be in rather a muddle

  from all ive heard said lori-
mer the palestine baseball club is
worth about thirty cents in bad money
yet i dont see here any particular evi-
dence of frugality in fact it seems
to me this office is only fit for a con-
cern paying fifty per cent profit-

  to all intents and purposes the
headquarters of the palestine baseball
club are here interrupted miss
walker dryly pointing to the railed
inclosure wherein she stood the rest
of the office is for mr jellibond and
his bonds mortgages and deeds

  oh i see we only pay for desk
room 

  we pay nothing your uncle built
and owned this building it must seem
rather strange to you mr lorimer
that i should be telling you of your

own uncles affairs-

  i only wish you would miss
walker if you can-and will said
lorimer i never lived in palestine
and hadnt seen my uncle for over a
dozen years i know something less
than nothing about his affairs

  miss walker was eying him with
a certain objective interest while she
pretended to be looking elsewhere

  well she said swinging a diminu-
tive foot ive only been here two
days and i never lived in palestine


the populacr magazine

either all the same ive managed to
learn some things this office is given
rent free so long as the palestine base-
ball club remains in the lorimer fam-
ily if you sell the franchise the office
reverts like the rest of the building
to the estate surely the lawyer told
you that

  mr given gave me some papers
which i havent read and if it was in
the will i must have skipped it re-
plied lorimer but is mr jellibond
paid for being the business manager
certainly

  then what right has he to use the
greater part of this office-and evi-
dently the greater part of his time-
in attending to business of his own
miss walker pursed up her vivid
lips and eyed the ceiling

  apparently mr jellibond had
some such understanding with your
uncle she said tapping her white
teeth with a pencil but i see mr
jellibond coming across the street and
he can explain everything far better
than i she turned with a subdued
smile to her desk

 the door opened and mr philander
jellibond as if wafted by the early
april breeze blew into the room in-
deed it seemed as if he generated a
breeze of his own wherever he went
and that breeziness was the keynote
of his character he was a large glis-
tening gentleman in a tight frock coat
and very high collar with black string
tie

  my dear boy he bellowed throw-
ing wide his short arms as lorimer in-
troduced himself silas lorimers
nephew welcome my boy wel-
come to palestine and your inherit-
ance having relieved himself thus
mr jellibond glistened all over and
struck his most breezy attitude

  little miss walker her back to
them seemed entirely absorbed in her
work nevertheless her shoulders had
begun to shake and during the en-

suing interview it may be presumed
that the little close-set ears under the
amber curls did not miss a single word

  lorimer was not long in discovering
that extracting information from mr
jellibond amounted almost to a physical
feat mr jellibond was expansive but
vague and as lorimer persisted in his
quest for information the other slowly
and reluctantly abandoned some of his
humid breeziness and grew rather
more cold and distant

  your uncle sir and i were very
old friends he was saying in short
bosom friends some few years before
his death mr lorimers health made
it obligatory that he should give up all
active business affairs he asked me
to take over the business management
of the invincibles and purely out of
friendship i consented-in a moment
of weakness i say in a moment of
weakness as the season is less than
three months duration and the salary
offered me merely nominal i couldnt
be expected of course to wholly aban-
don my own fairly lucrative calling
in short it was agreed that i should
carry it  here-hence this satisfac-
tory arrangement and mr jelli-
bond waved a large mottled hand
which reminded lorimer of a section
of headcheese

  was that a written agreement

  it was not sir replied mr jel-
libond in pained surprise i have said
your uncle and i were bosom friends
so it was not put in writing most cer-
tainly not it was a gentlemens
agreement do i understand sir
suddenly looking very formidable
that you doubt my word

  not at all mr jellibond i only
wish to know how long the agreement
is supposed to last i infer then that
it terminated automatically on my
uncles death

  i suppose so i didnt take the pre-
caution of protecting myself by a writ-
ten agreement im not that kind sir
the prodigl

ii

nor was your uncle im an open man
sir open as the day finished mr jel-
libond throwing wide his short arms

  undoubtedly but look here said
lorimer in exasperation i merely
want some information its nothing
to me if the palestine baseball club
once paid and doesnt now im here
to sell not to run it and if you the
business manager cant give me some
idea of what its worth who can  how
do we stand thats what id like to
know

  mr jellibond hemmed and hawed
and mopped his brow well for the
past three or four years the team has
been run at a loss-

  how much

 a nominal sum sir thats all i
can say in short its impossible for
me to be more explicit until ive gone
thoroughly into the matter a proceed-
ing involving both time and trouble i
cant give you the precise figures off-
hand i advise you to sell out if you
get the chance the franchise i should
say is worth a thousand or so and
then there is lorimer park owned by
the club its value is probably ten
thousand and half of this is mort-
gaged at six per cent

  not having examined the papers
given him by mr owen this was agree-
able news to lorimer he was richer
than he had thought

  in short concluded mr jellibond
getting up and making a great display
of activity i really must ask you to
excuse me for the present for im
a very busy man sir i shall be only
too happy to go fully into the matter
with you but you must give me time
ill appoint an evening in the near fu-
ture when we can go thoroughly into
the matter together you may rely
mr lorimer on my utmost assistance
in the meantime-

  and so wafted on the jellibond ver-
biage and breeziness lorimer found
himself presently on the sidewalk with-

out realizing in the least how it had
happened

  he stood irresolute for a moment
and then with a careless shrug lighted
a cigarette and strolled up the street
after all he had learned enough he
owned a five-thousand-dollar interest in
lorimer park and the franchise was
worth perhaps two thousand at the
most he would sell out for seven thou-
sand cash or the nearest offer the
trouble however was to find a buyer

chapter iv

an offer is made

  on returning to the empire house
lorimer found stuveysant and conyers
absent it developing later that each had
gone off on some pleasure or business
of his own thus because there was
nothing else to do lorimer remembered
the papers given him by mr owen and
decided to have a look at them

  the title deeds to lorimer park and
other matters relating to the mortgage
and the ball club he glanced through
hurriedly his interest centering on the
communication from his uncle this
was dated two years before the writers
death and from the context it was
apparent that silas q lorimer had
known nothing of his nephews subse-
quent graceless career the letter was
as follows

  my dear harry no doubt it will sur-
prise you to find your name mentioned so
prominently in my will but for that matter
it has rather surprised myself as after the
quarrel with your father i washed my hands
of the new york lorimers and tried to
forget i had any such relatives

  twelve years have since passed and
though your father and i never made up
our difference  have been thinking lately a
good deal about you  remember you as
a lad and with what favor i then regarded
you

  i dare say you will think my will eccen-
tric no doubt also the fact of my having
a ward will astonish you one however
cannot exist without human ties and after
your deflection-for which i dont blame


the vovulacr magazine

you seeing you were but a lad at the lime
i quarreled with your father and had to do
as he ordered you without inquiring into the
merits of our difference-i found it neces-
sary to procure a substitute this was pro-
vided in the daughter of an old friend whom
i had known in pennsylvania on the death
of her father phyllis sands became my
ward and she has proved a blessing and
stanch support in my declining years

  you harry are the last of the lorimers
and you and my ward are the two i have
cared for most in my lonely life it is my
earnest wish that you two should become
man and wife i have had the opportunity
of studying the characters of you both and
i know that one is the necessary complement
of the other you cannot fail to make each
other happy for though i have not seen
you for a dozen years the child is father
of the man and i have heard very flattering
reports of your university and business ca-
reer

  at this point lorimer suddenly be-
came restless and looked out of the win-
dow it was with an effort that at
length he resumed reading

  neither of you need money i know you
inherited at least a quarter of a million from
your father while phyllis has a small in-
come thus neither of you can think i am
using the money threat to compel my wishes
as regards your marriage i have left the
large margin of five years so that you both
will have ample time to become acquainted
and to know each other

  phyllis being less well provided for than
you i have left her the lorimer home-
stead  this and the income from her fathers
estate should support her in comfort if not
luxury i mention this merely to show that
as in your own case there is no necessity
for her to share in the estate except under
the conditions i have named

  as for the palestine baseball club the
property is a little gold mine if rightly han-
dled it is temporarily run down because
ive been unable to maintain the all-neces-
sary personal supervision my fighting days
are over and my grip has relaxed mr jel-
libond is not the man for the position he
occupies but against my better judgment

i	yielded to his importunities i needed a
man whom i knew at least to be honest

  it all depends on yourself harry what
you make of the property it will mean hard
and intelligent work but nothing worth while
can be won otherwise the invincibles have
an old and honorable standing and have

given me the bulk of my fortune i hope
you will find your pleasure and profit in
making the fine old club what it was in my
best days you have the means and like
every healthy american an inbred love for
the great national game the name of lori-
mer has always been identified with the in-
vincibles and my earnest hope and wish is
that you carry that association on when i
am gone that you will do so worthily
and make the club what it was before i had
to relinquish the helm i have not the slight-
est doubt

  lorimer folded the letter and placed
it in his pocket then he stared out of
the window his fingers beating a rest-
less tattoo against the glass

  conyers entered in the midst of his
musings well he greeted have you
found out yet what youre worth-you
bloated baseball capitalist

  about seven thousand i guess
and lorimer told of his conversation
with mr jellibond the trouble will
be to find a quick cash buyer

  ive found you one said conyers
calmly its a fellow by the name of

delaney-

  pete delaney 

 yes what do you know about
him

  nothing i happened to hear the
name in a chance conversation on the
car to-day i suppose hes a local lumi-
nary 

  conyers shrugged more or less
but the funny and best part of it is that
i know him i met him several years
ago in new york and hadnt seen him
until i bumped into him on the street
to-day he was very glad to see me
and wanted to know what brought me
to palestine so i told him and to
make a long story short hes willing to
give fifty-five hundred cash for the
franchise and lorimer park hows
that for work

  fine exclaimed lorimer youre
certainly a hustler mort but look
here i think i should get at least an-
other thousand-

  i dont believe youll get another
the prodigal



bid interrupted conyers ive learned
a few things since ive been here the
franchise isnt worth sour apples de-
laney wants lorimer park not the fran-
chise but he knows you wont sell one
without the other because i told him so
hes got to take the good with the bad
see fifty-five hundred is his bed-rock
figure and we may miss our market by
trying to grab too much you see we
cant afford to sit around and hold out
for a few hundreds more wheres the
money coming from to pay the mort-
gage let alone anything else-

  i know all that said lorimer but
im not fool enough to jump at a mans
first offer mort its a forced sale of
course but delaney doesnt have to
know that

  the entrance of stuveysant put a mo-
mentary end to the discussion mr
stuveysant was somewhat excited and
in high spirits

  what do you think he exclaimed
ive just seen miss sands

  oh is that all sneered conyers
i thought maybe somebody had been
insulting you by offering you a job
well i suppose shes a rare old valen-
tine eh

  valentine my eye exclaimed mr
stuveysant talk about your egyp-
tian princesses shes a peacherino on
wheels you just want to see her and
talk to her shes as nice as she looks

  why-were you talking to her de-
manded lorimer

  sure said stuveysant unabashed
you know me rummy think id pass
up a chance like that -the first regular
looker ive seen since leaving new york
why it was like getting money from
home its perked me up something
wonderful

  but how did you meet her asked
lorimer

  easiest thing in the world replied
mr stuveysant airily i was curious
to know what miss sands looked like

so i just went and found out thats
all she arrived here a few days ago
and has taken up her residence at the
lorimer homestead i learned that
from the barkeep downstairs he knows
whats doing in this great metropolis if
he doesnt know how to mix a bronx
cocktail

  so i went to the lorimer home-
stead and luck was with me for i spied
a divinity in the front garden i went
in and asked if this was where miss
simpkins lived the divinity said no
she the divinity was a stranger in town
and her name was sands not simpkins
curious wasnt it  whereupon i apolo-
gized and-and-well somehow we ex-
changed a few ideas regarding roses
and other palestine flora before i was
called upon to retire shes simply
great rummy i only wish i had your
chance my boy

  i havent any chance and whats
more i dont want any said lorimer
peevishly dont start on that subject
again that miss sands happens to
be an egyptian princess doesnt alter
the situation in the least

  well said conyers ill go over
and see delaney again for we dont
want to stay in this cemetery all year
whats your bed-rock figure lorimer
will you take six thousand if hes fool
enough to offer it 

  ill take it only if i have to replied
lorimer ask for seven and stall
around for sixty-five

  conyers had been gone about half an
hour when a letter left at the desk by
a messenger was brought up to lori-
mer he glanced curiously a moment
at the firm writing before tearing open
the envelope the contents ran

  dear mr lorimer will you call at the
office this evening any time after five i
have something to say to you about the pal-
estine baseball club please postpone all
negotiations for its sale until after our in-
terview yours very truly

miss walker
	the popular magazine



  ha you old sultan exclaimed
stuveysant whose keen eyes had seen
the feminine writing on the envelope
so thats how youve been spending
the day made a conquest already
eh 

  business my boy replied lorimer
absently purely business

  business my eye said mr stuvey-
sant youve been making a date
and i suppose youre going to keep it
lorimer drummed on the window a
moment before replying then he folded
the letter and placed it in his pocket
why he said slowly i think so

chapter v

lorimer learns something further
about the lemon and little
miss walker

  it is difficult to refuse a woman when
evidently her whole soul is in the cause
for which she pleads more especially
is it difficult if that woman be good to
look upon at least youth finds it no
easy matter and harry lorimer was
young enough to appreciate the walker
physical assets moreover it was not
given him to refuse anybody anything
within reason native generosity being
supported during the past two years of
his life by a reckless carelessness as to
his pocket he had given lavishly right
and left so long as there was credit at
his bankers now however he could
not do the impossible

  something of all this he was endeav-
oring to convey to miss walker as they
sat alone and eyed each other across
mr jellibonds desk that gentleman
had gone to albany hence the request
to call after five

  its out of the question miss
walker lorimer was saying why
should i hold on to the property as you
suggest in the first place i cant af-
ford to and in the second theres no

money in it-

not now mr lorimer but there

was once and there should be again
no business on earth could pay if it
was run like this youve seen for
yourself the kind of man mr jellibond
is i dont say he did anything dishon-
est but certainly the palestine base-
ball club has been the merest side issue
with him he has this office rent free
uses nearly all of it for his own busi-
ness and is paid fifty dollars a week

to manage the club-

  what

  yes and not by the season but by
the year your uncle trusted him im-
plicitly and o kd every report sent
in here is a balance sheet for prac-
tically the last two seasons which ive
managed to make up youll see here
at a glance what it might take a month
to get out of mr jellibond

  hm murmured lorimer taking
the paper and running a quick experi-
enced eye down the items who is
this field manager that gets forty dol-
lars a week is his name clark
yes he was engaged by mr jelli-
bond

  i saw him to-day on the car said
lorimer and wasnt very much taken
with his looks what are these inci-
dentals that total thirty-five a week
little miss walker went through her
favorite maneuver of pursing her vivid
lips and eying the ceiling i asked mr
jellibond and he became quite peevish
he said something about gas stamps
printing and so forth

  and this office boy i havent seen
one so far

  oh hes generally out running er-
rands for mr jellibond he goes home
at five

  lorimer sighed and lighted a ciga-
rette this is all very informative
he said eying the balance sheet but i
dont see what i can do we cant
prove anything irregular and my uncle

passed every report-

  im making no charge against mr
jellibond interrupted miss walker
the prodigal



stiffly i didnt request this interview
for that purpose my real reason for
the interview mr lorimer was to sug-
gest that you not only keep the prop-
erty but manage it yourself-

 who me

  yes you miss walker folded her
hands and looked at him i hope you
wont think me presumptuous in all
this-

  not a bit i can only thank you and
wonder why youve gone to so much
trouble-for you must have worked
very hard indeed during the past two
days to become so well posted why
are you so keen on my not selling to
delaney 

  she met his eyes frankly because
for one reason i dont like to sit by
and see a person robbed no matter
who it is mr delaneys offer isnt fair
at all hes taking advantage of your
ignorance and lack of interest the po-
tential value of the property must be
considered as well as the actual and i
believe that potential value to be con-
siderable

  then she continued slowly there
is what you might call the sentimental
side of the question arent there some
things mr lorimer that cant be meas-
ured in dollars and cents dont you
think it would be a great thing a very
great thing to try and make the club
what it used to be it seems to me the
fight itself would be worth something
you are the last of the lorimers and
the name for twenty-five years has been
identified with the palestine baseball
club

  thats how the situation appeals to
me mr lorimer of course it will
mean the very hardest kind of work
but then isnt it better to wear out than
to rust out it would be another mat-
ter if you couldnt afford the time but
i happen to know that you can dont
think im trying to exaggerate the good
points of the proposition and minimize
the bad ones it wont be any tri-

umphal march if you refuse to sell
out you may make enemies you will
have a fight on your hands and plenty
of the hardest kind of work in a
word the situation is crying out for a
man and from one or two things you
said to mr jellibond i have ventured
to think you may be that man mr
lorimer

  he was silent being more stirred by
her words than he cared to admit even
to himself

  now concluded miss walker
flushing suddenly and looking timid
ive said all that was on my mind and
no doubt ive said quite too much it
was good of you to listen so patiently
i didnt mean to be impudent or pre-
sumptuous nor do i ask or expect
mr lorimer that you take my mere
word for all this i only ask that you
dont close with mr delaneys offer in
a hurry i ask that you look over the
ground carefully and find out these
things for yourself

  i thank you for all youve said
exclaimed lorimer at length its aw-
fully good of you and i appreciate it
more than i can say but theres a
vital fact miss walker which you dont
know-nor did my uncle when he left
me the property and advised me to hold
on to it at that time-two years ago-
i was worth about a quarter of a mil-
lion  to-day i am worth nothing but
this baseball property it isnt that im
afraid to take a sporting chance but
simply that i havent any money to risk
i havent a blessed cent the truth is
he finished ive been all kinds of a
fool i didnt lose my money i threw

it away-

  i know that said the girl calmly
this morning wasnt the first time i
saw you mr lorimer ive seen you
before

  he stared where when
why the other evening you made
a little speech i remember

  lorimer colored hotly and turned em-


the popular magazine

barrassed eyes to the window so she
had been dining that evening in au-
gerots she had actually seen him in
vthe role of prodigal and buffoon he
writhed inwardly at memory of the au-
spicious occasion and his stupid silly
speech

    you said on that occasion you were
  celebrating the event of a fool and his
  money being soon parted added miss
  walker so what i know hasnt been
  learned from any gossip that may be
  making the rounds of palestine my
  escort that night is a new yorker if
  im not and he told me something
  about you and your friends

    that wouldnt be hard i imagine
  said lorimer with a shrug the new
  york papers seem to know more about
  me than i do myself ive been no
  saint he added with a touch of bit-
  terness but theyve credited me with
  many things i never did-not that it
  matters in the least of course they
  can make all the copy out of it they
  want to its a matter of perfect indif-
  ference to me

   is it asked miss walker she
 avas tapping her teeth with a pencil and
 looking fixedly at his profile as he stood
 with half-averted head against the light
 it was a face that held more than a
 hint of latent strength and power a face
 both the masculine and feminine world
 instinctively liked

    is it she repeated do you hon-
  estly think reputations dont count for
  anything it seems to me they must
  be worth something when they are so
  difficult to win and so easy to lose

    i hope youre not trying to read me
  a sermon said lorimer you dont
  strike me as being one of those foolish
  people who choose to believe a person
  does wrong because he doesnt know
  any better

    oh dear no laughed miss walker
  sermons are quite out of my line be-
  sides theyre awfully tedious and ive
  quite enough to do with the beams in

my own eye i wouldnt dream of ex-
perimenting with other peoples motes

i only venture to throw out as a sort
of general remark neither new or di-
verting that reputations are worth
something after all and that if they
happen to be lost why one can happen
to find them again also that hard
work seems the best cure for boredom
have you ever tried it mr lorimer

  he turned and looked at her

  miss walker you know me for what
i am-a prodigal and neer-do-well
ive dissipated a quarter of a million
in two years that is my record you
knew it it seems when you asked for
this interview you ask me now to
keep the property and even manage it
myself yet say the situation is crying
out for a man have you the smallest
reason for thinking me that man
doesnt all you know about me give
the flat lie to that come be honest
with me what is the real reason you
dont wish me to sell out you are
clever-ive discovered that-but im
not quite a fool you know

  if you were said miss walker
tartly as she put away the carbon paper
and began tidying up this interview
wouldnt have taken place mr lorimer
its because i dont think you a fool
no matter how successfully you may
have played it that ive ventured to
say what i have

  you say i know youre a prodigal
and neer-do-well but i dont know any-
thing of the kind i know you were
but we arent to-day nor to-morrow
what we were yesterday life doesnt
stand still like that and we have the
daily choice of going forward or back-
ward you cant remain merely a prod-
igal mr lorimer even if you want to
prodigals either reform or end in jail-
if they dont blow their brains out

  of course its absolutely none of
my business she finished but all the
same i think it a burning shame if a
man of your years and evident educa-
the cpcrotdigal



tion deliberately elects to rot away his
life in sordid idleness your duty and
profit both lie here and after youve
proved the truth of what ive done my
best to show you if you refuse to take
hold and play the man then ill be very
much mistaken in my estimation of
your character

  now added miss walker biting
her lips as she jammed on her hat
youve made me say what ive been
trying not to no doubt if you do de-
cide to take hold your first official act
will be to discharge me but i dont
care i-i had to get it out of my sys-
tem or-or burst

  lorimers reply to all this was en-
tirely irrelevant

  if i may venture in all humbleness
to say so you look simply great miss
walker when you fire up like that
upon my word you do a good old-
fashioned laying-out is worth taking
just to see you look like that and -yet
you said sermons werent in your line
miss walker stabbed the amber curls
with a formidable collection of pins a
proceeding lorimer watched with con-
siderable interest and trepidation

  i dont know what you mean by
firing up and a laying-out mr lori-
mer she said with dignity and i
never sermonize i was merely point-
ing out quite impersonally and dispas-
sionately-

  of course thats what i meant
may i see you home miss walker
there are several things id like to ask
about this suggestion of yours

  certainly mr lorimer-on condi-
tion that if we discuss the matter fur-
ther you wont lose your temper again
i he exclaimed in astonishment
why-er-hum- oh yes i prom-
ise

  thank you said miss walker
sweetly and with the most engaging air
of innocence

  they left the office together walking
the distance to her humble boarding
b

house and on the way lorimer re-
stated the uncompromising fact that
while ultimate profit and present duty
pointed to his retaining the propertyhe
lacked the means even if he were blessed
with the submerged ability

  i havent any wealthy friends or
relatives who might be willing to lend
me the money and it will take money
to swing this thing he finished what
can a man do without capital

  what havent men done without it 
she countered but you wouldnt need
so much for one thing couldnt you
put a second mortgage on lorimer
park

  they had reached the boarding house
and from the penetrating glare of a
neighboring arc light lorimer discerned
dark circles under miss walkers eyes
and her air of utter weariness and
it struck him quite suddenly and for-
cibly that this girl must have been work-
ing very hard and solely in his interests 
whether right or wrong she had at least
the courage of her convictions and had
spared no effort in trying to convince
him

  some measure of his appreciation he
now attempted to voice but she would
not listen

  it is less than nothing mr lori-
mer she protested i did no more
than im paid for doing good night
and-and please forgive me for losing
my temper and-and saying things i
had absolutely no right to say

  lorimer made the return journey to
the empire house on foot for he
wished to think over all that had passed
and the more he thought over some
things miss walker had said the more
the words now unsoftened by the un-
deniable charm of her presence stung
his pride to anger

  the idea of talking to me as if i
were a two-year-old he reflected in-
dignantly im to hold onto this
wretched property simply because she
says so-well i wont hold onto it no
the cpocpuljr magazine

  

 womans going to dictate to me ill
 sell out ill take delaneys best offer
 therefore having arrived at this de-
 cision lorimers greeting to stuveysant
 on reaching the hotel was rather re-
 markable 

   ive decided to keep the property
 whats more im going to run the show
 myself

   mr stuvey sants mouth opened
slowly and he arose as slowly youre
what he demanded with terrible in-
 tensity

   lorimer calmly repeated his state-
 ment and stuveysants large bulk col-
 lapsed ponderously he stared at the
 other with the utmost concern

   you dont know what youre talking
 about rummy be rational my boy

 try and be rational-

   i was never more rational in my
 life my fat friend in fact i think this
 is the first lucid interval ive had in two
 long years

   but what do you know about run-
 ning a ball team wailed mr stuvey-
 sant and where the sam hill will
 you get the money

   lorimer laughed gayly oh run-
 ning a ball team doesnt require any
 superlative genius all you want is a
 good field manager as for the money
 ill raise it some way

   stuveysant gazed with helpless and
 suspicious amazement at his friend
 whats got into you anyway you
 talk as if somebody had left you a mil-
 lion you speak of tackling a job like
 this as if there was nothing to it but
 counting the gate receipts do you
 realize for a moment what it will mean
 it means working your neck off it

 means living in palestine-

   i know all that and do you realize
 my fat friend what it means to delib-
 erately rot away your life in sordid
 idleness

   huh mr stuveysant sat up and
 looked alarmed you talk like a per-

 son out of a sunday-school tract be

rational my boy-

  do you realize that its better to
wear out than rust out continued
lorimer do you know that work is
the best cure for boredom do you
realize that you cant remain merely a
prodigal that you must go forward or
backward and that if you dont blow
your brains out youll end in jail do
you realize that its a burning shame if
a person of your years and education
doesnt take hold of things and play

the man-

 help cried mr stuveysant
whos been talking to you come
out with it no shuffling

  no one has been talking to me in
the sense you insinuate ive merely
been going into the palestine baseball
club finances with miss walker the
stenographer i told you i had a busi-
ness engagement

  oh i see and what does miss
walker look like

  i havent the least idea replied
lorimer shortly and quite untruthfully
what has her appearance got to do
with it

  here the boisterous entrance of con-
yers gave another twist to the conversa-
tion he had succeeded in getting the
promise of an extra five hundred from
delaney had made something of a cele-
bration and was quite well pleased with
himself therefore when he learned
of lorimers decision his feelings may
be better imagined than described his
initial incredulity and amazement soon
gave place to anger when he discovered
the other to be in earnest

  this is a harry of a note he ex-
claimed the drink showing in his eyes
you cant crawl out at the last minute
this way ive given my word to de-
laney and the deals closed youve
got to stick

  im sorry said lorimer but i
only looked into the proposition after
youd gone mort if the property is
the cpcrdigal



worth six thousand to delaney its
worth that to me

  thats beside the question retorted
conyers angrily you should have
thought of all that before its too late
now and the deal is closed

  nonsense

  i tell you it is im your duly au-
thorized representative and you told

me youd take six thousand-

  i told you id take it only if i had
to well it happens i dont have to i
wont take six thousand nor sixty thou-
sand 

  youve sold it for six thousand
delaney will hold you to it hes got
more money to spend on lawyers than
you i tell you the deals closed

  a change had slowly taken place in
lorimer the slack lines of his figure
had tautened a new look had come into
his eyes a new set to his mouth the
careless good-humored easy-going
companion the other two had known
was no longer in evidence this seemed
an entirely new creation a stranger to
them

  look here conyers he said it
strikes me you think im a bigger fool
than i am that ive been one in the
past because i hadnt the brains to be
anything else you seem to think im
going to give up the palestine baseball
club as easily as ive given up other
things well im not do you under-
stand youll be my duly authorized
representative with power to dispose
of the property when i sign an agree-
ment to that effect or give you power
of attorney i told you i was sorry
if id put you to any trouble and i
hate to talk like this but it seems to
me youve got a whole lot to say for
delaney in this matter and mighty little
for me

  conyers jumped up very red in the
face how dare you say that how
dare you insinuate im pulling for de-
laney so this is all the thanks i get
for trying to help you out well its

just what i expected ive tried to keep
you from making an ass of yourself
and all i get is abuse i know what
youve been doing youve been down at
the office listening to a lot of lies from
that yellow-headed stenographer who
has her own ax to grind oh ive

heard all about it-

  you keep miss walkers name out
of this cried lorimer his hands
clenching

  it was here that mr stuveysant rose
to the occasion with a celerity belied by
his bulk he took conyers and ran him
into his room locking the door on the
others threatening and uncomplimen-
tary verbiage

chapter vi

  getting rid of the deadwd

  billy wate arrived at the empire
house the following morning as if
palestine were but a stones throw
from newspaper row lorimer and
stuveysant for the sake of economy
shared the same room and to wates
astonishment he found them half
dressed despite the early hour from
the adjoining room came conyers
snores the session with delaney hav-
ing its inevitable aftermath

  well youre a couple of nice early
worms-or are you just going to bed
greeted the reporter i got a day off
and blew up in the milk special for a
look round fact is harry ive been
hearing a few things about these hash-
house invincibles of yours since i wrote
you and the thing looks pretty good

to me-

  youre a bit late on the wire my
boy interrupted stuveysant wielding
the razor with terrifying grimaces at
his vast reflection rummy reached
the same conclusion last night-thanks
to a mysterious starry-eyed damsel who
slugs a typewriter for a living yes
hes even going to run the whole show
himself and im just hanging round to


the popular magazine

tind out what particular style of funeral
decorations he prefers

  what exclaimed wate with genu-
ine pleasure tell me all about it

  so lorimer related in detail his in-
terview with miss walker omitting
however all reference to prodigals
wate listened with keen and interested
eyes

  this miss walker seems to be a live
wire all right he said as lorimer fin-
ished her advice is sound i couldnt
get any inside stuff about the palestine
club until  met a fellow called brown
who was born round here his kid
brother by the way is on the palestine
journal brown thinks well of the
proposition and that its a good thing
if you can push it along

  oh hell push it along said stu-
veysant i tell you he actually wants
to work where do you think hes
going now why down to the office
like a common slave by some occult
method one perfectly good prodigal has
been simply ruined

  lorimer reached the office before
nine but early as he was miss walker
was already busy at her desk

  another had also forestalled him-
the gangling gentleman with the long
blushing neck whom he had seen the
previous day on the car mr clark
had draped himself over the railed par-
tition his hat was on the back of his
head a cigarette pasted to his upper
lip and he was giving himself all the
airs of a welcome and honored guest
lorimer was ignorant of what had
passed but believed it could not have
been very pleasant for miss walker
had flushed to her ears

  i tell you she was saying as he
entered that i dont know when mr
jellibond will be in his hours are un-
certain-

  now sister dont get excited re-
monstrated mr clark easily leaning
over the railing and patting her on the

back i dont mind talking to you till

he does come in-

  here he was given a shove that sent
him sprawling over mr jellibonds
desk

  he arose to confront lorimer but
quite another lorimer from the one
miss walker had known there was
something in his level eyes the set of
his jaw that arrested the ready flow
of profanity on mr clarks lips and the
no less ready swing of his fist

  mr clark drew back and looked
lorimer up and down then as if
ashamed of his momentary misgivings
and satisfied of his own superior phy-
sical bulk he hitched up a shoulder
swaggered over and put his face down
close to the others

  fresh guy aint you he asked
only for there being a lady present
id kick the pants up over your head
ive a good mind to take you apart just

to see what makes you go-

  take your face away mr clark
 dont like it i dont like your lan-
guage either or your manners i dont
like anything about you miss walker
have we a contract with this gentle-
man  do we owe him anything 

  no mr lorimer

  very well said lorimer opening
the door good morning mr clark
dont come here again

  oh the tinhorn sport from new
york jeered mr clark recovering
from his astonishment you dont re-
quire my services eh well i should
worry percy  should certainly worry
let me tell you that you or nobody like
you can fire me see i aint workin
for you and you couldnt hire me to
i was through with that bunch of sand-
lotters callin themselves a ball team

anyhow-

  and youre through now said
lorimer get out

mr clark got but after his own
fashion this involving several further
the cpcrovigal



uncomplimentary remarks and various
dark threats

  and said he finishing his valedic-
tory address on the sidewalk ill be
runnin the invincibles when youre pan-
handlin on broadway you just wait
and see

  when at length the door closed on
his amiable countenance miss walker
looking rather flustered for one of her
evident capability stole a look at lori-
mer and then turned to her desk

  then-then you are going to man-
age the invincibles she asked

  it looks that way replied lorimer
dryly im starting in on the dead-
wood-and here comes the principal
piece he finished in an undertone as
the door opened and mr jellibond blew
in in his usual breezy manner

  mr jellibond on receipt of the star-
tling news gaped and almost swallowed
his post-breakfast cigar three facts
amazed him that lorimer had decided
to keep and manage the property that
he jellibond had to vacate promptly
that lorimer was suddenly proving to
be an uncomfortably different sort of
character than report had heralded in-
deed he was most unfairly declining to
act like the traditional prodigal of song
and legend

  why-why began mr jellibond
swelling visibly this is most unex-
pected sir most unexpected the
folly of retaining the property ill pass
over argument would be merely a
waste of words in short i see your
mind is made up sir as your uncles
nearest and dearest friend i gave you
my disinterested advice on the matter
and you have chosen to ignore it i
consider you havent been fair with me
sir you kept me in the dark you
pretended to listen to my advice while
knowing from the first you intended to
take this step-

  on the contrary mr jellibond i
didnt reach this decision until long
after my talk with you

  the other showed his utter disbelief
of this statement his breeziness had
grown somewhat cyclonic and he paced
the floor the tails of the tight frock coat
considerably agitated his manner had
become hectoring abusive

  am i to understand sir i am also
to te deprived at a moments notice of
my vested rights i speak sir of my
meager occupancy of this office

  i think one could hardly call it mea-
ger air jellibond nor are you being
dispossessed at a moments notice nor
is occupancy on sufferance a vested

right-

  sufferance sir sufferance why
-why sir you are insulting grossly

insulting and impertinent-

  now see here mr jellibond in-
terrupted lorimer suddenly developing
the look and manner with which he had
greeted mr clark you have gone quite
far enough and i dont propose to lis-
ten to any of your abuse youve been
treated most generously and any fair-
minded man would appreciate such past
benefits as youve enjoyed instead of
adopting such an attitude for your
own sake i dont wish to go into your
management of the property and i had
hoped to avoid any unpleasantness i
will not however be bullied nor im-
posed upon-

  sir thundered the other with up-
lifted brows imposed upon do you
insinuate i ever imposed upon any one
during my life is this the thanks i
get for all ive done in a moment of

weakness sir i obliged your uncle-

  your moment of weakness said
lorimer netted you in salary alone
over five thousand dollars while youve
been here you got the services of a
stenographer office boy and office room
absolutely free it wouldnt require
many moments of weakness like yours
mr jellibond to make a man rich
youve opened this subject and now
let me say that i think you took an un-
fair advantage of your friendship with


the vovulak magazine

my uncle and his evident incapacity due
to ill health whether he ever allowed
you to use this office and its employees
is open to question but at all events
your meager occupancy ends right
here

  gladly sir gladly exclaimed mr
jellibond waving his short arms i
would scorn to remain a moment under
the same roof with such a character as
you have proved yourself to be my
few poor effects shall be removed at
once a man open as the day like my-
self is at a serious disadvantage with
a person of your stamp sir but i wont
tolerate for a moment any public utter-
ance of the base insinuations youve
voiced here solely for the sake of
the friendship i bore your uncle i will
condescend to overlook them i also
condescend to take into account your
youth ignorance and evident lack of
breeding good day sir

  and good day to you miss walker
he finished glaring wrathfully at the
stenographer i can thank you i dare
say for instigating this highly dishon-
orable action of your new employer
you realized i would have discharged
you for thorough incompetency had i
condescended to retain the management
and so at the price of truth and honor
you have not hesitated to ingratiate
yourself behind my back with the new
regime such conduct i can only liken
to-that of a snake in the grass a snake
in the grass madam

  as the door slammed lorimer and
miss wlker eyed each other then both
suddenly laughed her eyes were glow-
ing her cheeks flushed

  well he grinned the next thing
on the program is the second mortgage
ill have to scout around-

  dont you think it might be best to
place it say in albany with some
one who has no connection or interest
here

 why

  well mr lorimer im beginning

to think that several people in palestine
would like to see you sell out i was
brought up in a small town and i know
how its people pull together no doubt
youll consider me an alarmist but i
really think it might be better to place
it with some concern that would have
no ulterior motive in causing you trou-
ble by calling it in suddenly or foreclos-
ing if you wanted an extension-

  oh laughed lorimer there wont
be anything like that you may be sure
i wont place it with any connection of
mr jellibonds

  well here comes mr delaney said
the girl glancing through the window
so youll have to attend to him before
doing anything else

  mr peter delaney known locally as
smiling pete presented himself with
the facial disturbance that had earned
him his nickname he looked like a
prosperous undertaker and might have
been taken for anything but what he
was

  well said he with his bubbling
laugh after introducing himself
thought id drop in mr lorimer as
i was passing and hand you this my-
self he pulled a check from his
pocket and tossed it carelessly over the
desk

  lorimer looked fixedly at the six-
thousand-dollar scrap of paper
whats this for he asked

  why laughed delaney for the
franchise and lorimer park i guess
you know youre lucky mr lorimer
to get such a cash figure but i never
was one to split hairs or play with small
potatoes and then knowing your rep-
resentative mr conyers counted for
something

  lorimer shook his head and returned
the check the property isnt for sale
mr delaney im sorry but surely you
knew that

  the delaney astonishment was mag-
nificent knew it but its sold i
closed the deal last night with your rep-
the prdgal



resentative mr conyers id have sent
this check last night with him if id had
one handy

  and i would have returned it mr
delaney i made up my mind last night
not to sell

  im sorry mr lorimer but you
know business is business the deal
was closed last night and here are the
papers signed by mr conyers
lorimer eyed them indifferently of
course you know those are worthless
mr delaney mr conyers hadnt the
authority to sign anything his services
were purely voluntary and temporary
ive given no one power of attorney
and im quite able to attend to business
in person

  youve got your price mr lorimer
what more do you want  do you want
to fight this through the courts
youve no case to take into court
replied lorimer as for my price i
havent got it i told conyers to ask
for seven and hang out for sixty-five-
and ive a witness to that conversation
you know as well as i that agreement
isnt worth the paper its written on
not legally admitted delaney un-
willingly not if you repudiate con-
yers signature his facial disturb-
ance had not stopped but he was eying
lorimer closely and shrewdly for like
mr jellibond he was finding this prod-
igal disappointing

  ive nothing to show in writing-
nor has conyers i guess-that you gave
him power to act for you he con-
tinued its merely a question of
honor mr lorimer i know conyers
know hes a clean sport all the way
through and therefore treated him as a
friend without thinking it necessary to
have my lawyer negotiate the deal
conyers said you wanted six thousand
and i gave it i never doubted his au-
thority to act for you nor did he he
acted in perfectly good faith and so
did i legally it seems you have the
advantage but i know youre not the

kind to use it mr lorimer i know
youre the sort who rightly regards a
word-of-mouth agreement as even more
binding if possible than a written one

i know you arent going to repudiate
that signature

  thats exactly what im going to
do mr delaney i guess my sporting
instinct is as good as your own but it
doesnt run to idiocy-at least not this
morning that sort of appeal might
have worked me last week but not now
conyers had absolutely no authority
from me to close the deal hes not deaf
nor a fool and he knows plain english
he knows what my last words to him
were im not bound by honor nor
anything else to stick to whatever agree-
ment he made with you the property
isnt for sale and that settles it

  delaney shifted his cigar pocketed
the check and arose leisurely he was
far too experienced to permit his face
to betray his thoughts and the old smile
was still in excellent working order

  well he said carelessly with an
amused laugh theres no need to get
excited sonny nobodys going to
sandbag you and take away the fran-
chise by main force i guess it aint
so valuable as all that you just set
over it for a spell and see what you can
hatch out i thought i was doing busi-
ness with a man not a kid you wanted
to sell i put up the cash and now you
put up a holler and welsh on the play
well it serves me right for letting
friendship get the best of business ive
had a dirty deal but well let it go at
that this kids game of playing with
your fingers crossed aint in my line
and with a cool nod and another
amused contemptuous laugh he saun-
tered out

   the words stung as it was meant they
should and they brought an angry light
to lorimers eyes

  there goes another enemy i sup-
pose he remarked with forced light-


the cpocpulacr magazine

ness to miss walker thats three
to start with-not a bad days work

  its easy enough to make them if
one refuses to do what certain people
wish replied the stenographer its
rather strange that your friend mr
conyers thought himself vested with
such sweeping authority did he tell
you last night he had gone so far

  he said he had closed the deal but
he didnt say he had put his name to
anything

  do you think mr delaney was sin-
cere i-i mean-

  i know what you mean said lori-
mer grimly but im not guessing
aloud

  the first mortgage on lorimer park
was held by an individual called jep-
son doing a general mortgage and loan
business under the name of the pales-
tine guaranty  loan co him lori-
mer interviewed and found he had
no insuperable objection to advancing
an additional two thousand on the
property mr jepson had a mild re-
ligious look about him and also pre-
sumably ample resources for on con-
clusion of the negotiations lorimer left
with a check on the palestine  empire
bank

  his next step was to visit this insti-
tution and open a running account also
incidentally making the acquaintance of
mr jonas wishart the president in
this individual he found another agree-
able gentleman who like mr jepson
spoke quite feelingly of the late silas
q lorimer and the pleasure he experi-
enced in meeting the nephew he was
delighted at the latters determination
to take hold of things with the firm
touch of youth and give the town the
sort of ball team it used to have he
appreciated the opening of such an ac-
count and promised all the accommo-
dation in his power

  so lorimer returned to the office feel-
ing he had made a real start and that he
had accomplished a good days work

certainly the most he had done in that
line for two years

   in the office a tall dark girl was talk-
ing to miss walker and she arose lei-
surely as he entered

  i am miss sands she said simply
you are mr lorimer

  he bowed feeling rather awkward
and embarrassed

chapter vii

the ancient story  a womans
influence

  well said miss sands composedly
dont you think mr lorimer it is
about time we knew each other i
understand you have decided to man-
age the invincibles and as i have also
decided to make palestine my home we
couldnt very well avoid each other for
all time could we its too bad your
uncle put such a distressing clause in
his will but well have to make the best
of it so long as fate has brought us
to the same town and we were bound
to meet sooner or later in any case-es-
pecially as your stenographer happens
to be an old college friend of mine-
why i thought it better to take the bull
by the horns and have it over and done
with so i hope you will understand
and pardon the alfresco proceedings
her matter-of-factness and the
amused direct manner in which she
had spoken of the distressing clause
put lorimer entirely at ease

  im very glad miss sands you de-
cided to take the bull by the horns
he said with a laugh indeed i thank
you of course it was my place to do
so for aside from all else i felt i
should introduce myself seeing the re-
lationship you bore toward my uncle
and how much he thought of you but
to tell you the honest truth that dis-
tressing clause stopped me

  you thought i might attempt to
carry it into effect by main force she
laughed
the prdgl



  hardly miss sands i thought you
might credit me with the intention you
see to be quite frank-though i imag-
ine its no secret-ive no money and
you would have been perfectly justi-
fied in thinking me a miserable fortune

hunter-

  and now perhaps youll think me
one sighed miss sands a twinkle in
her dark eyes yes its a most dis-
tressing clause mr lorimer how-
ever we can circumvent it by promis-
ing faithfully to ignore it so i hereby
pledge you my solemn word sir never
to marry you never under any cir-
cumstances 

  he laughed and bowed over the prof-
fered hand i return the same guar-
antee madam

  then we are friends sir

  if you will so far honor me
and you really forgive me for hav-
ing been your uncles ward 

  as you forgive me for having been
his nephew

  agreed laughed miss sands strik-
ing her hand into his here endeth
the embarrassing situation

  thanks to your graciousness and
common sense added lorimer

  oh said she i really cannot ac-
cept the compliment for it was miss
walker who advised me to do the com-
mon-sense thing perhaps youve no-
ticed mr lorimer what a very com-
mon-sense sort of person she is
then if i may be permitted to live
up to such a reputation said miss
walker turning from her desk dont
you think its time you acquainted mr
lorimer with the other and perhaps
 less important object of this visit
right my dear as usual replied
miss sands airily i always forget
youre a business woman virginia and
that i mustnt waste business peoples
time so if you dont mind mr lori-
mer let us proceed to business i want
to buy two thousand dollars worth of
the palestine baseball club-

  w-what stammered lorimer
miss sands suggests that you form
a limited company and that she buy that
amount of stock put in miss walker
youre looking for capital mr lori-
mer and miss sands is looking for a
good investment so why not get to-
gether-

  and im to take your money and
stake it on this gamblers chance-for
thats all it is exclaimed lorimer ad-
dressing miss sands not much its
ten to one the stock would never pay a

dividend-

  now theres no use talking like that
mr lorimer for i know better inter-
rupted miss sands i know what the
property used to pay and what it should
again if i hadnt faith in it and your
management you may be quite sure the
suggestion wouldnt have been made
your faith in my ability is extremely
flattering replied lorimer he spoke
lightly but he was profoundly moved
by this totally unexpected evidence of
trust and confidence  the part of a vir-
tual stranger no i thank you miss
sands but its quite impossible its
all right to gamble with whats ones
own but entirely a different matter
when the stakes belong to some one else
i will not risk your money on this gam-
ble and that is final

  so be it she sighed im awfully
disappointed of course but still i thank
you for your friendly advice

  at this point stuveysant and wate
entered and lorimer making the in-
troductions all round thus gave stu-
veysants and miss sands chance ac-
quaintance the sanction of convention

  wate and lorimer had a long busi-
ness talk with miss walker before the
reporter left for new york while
stuveysant on hearing that miss sands
had some shopping to do suddenly dis-
covered that business would take him
in the same general direction what
this particular business was he omitted
to mention and miss sands politely re-


the popular magazine

fraining from questioning the legiti-
macy of the excuse they left the office
together

  lorimer had not seen conyers since
the previous evening and he went home
that night with the intention of making
up their difference as wate had said
he was loyal in his friendships and
thinking over what had passed he felt
he might have been too hasty and failed
to take into consideration that no doubt
conyers had been influenced by drink
the awkward situation the other had
placed him in with delaney he would
pass over and say nothing about

  at the empire house however he
heard surprising and unpleasant news
from stuveysant

  well greeted that gentleman the
triumvirate has bust up with a bang
conyers has quit cold taken all his
stuff and gone where the woodbine
twineth

  what left town

  no gone to a hashery down the
street

  whats got into him that he acts in
this kid way asked lorimer looking
troubled surely he isnt sore about
what passed last night we both lost
our tempers and said more than we

meant ill go look him up-

  dont said stuveysant laconically
he wasnt so drunk last night as you
seem to think and meant every word
he said he repeated it to me this
evening said youd given him full au-
thority to close the deal and that you
had ditched delaney and himself of
course i told him in so many words
he was a liar and we had a bit of a
row hence this cleaner atmosphere he
said he was going to leave anyway
is he crazy asked lorimer an-
grily getting up ill go over right
now and see what he has to say about
this-

  sit down thats just what he
wants-the chance to make a grand-
stand play dont you see the game

hes bled you dry and now that theres
nothing more to be got out of you hes
thrown you over and made solid with
delaney he must stick to the lie to
save his face and give him the excuse
for breaking away he takes the in-
teresting role of martyr-the trusting
friend shamefully betrayed bless you
we havent the chance to repudiate him
for he has repudiated us he cant
stomach the dishonorable way in which
youve treated the confiding and im-
maculate delaney

  i cant believe it exclaimed lori-
mer why-why i treated mort con-
yers like a brother you know i did
fatty so long as i was able he never
had anything but the best from me
sure i know but the more you
do for people the more enemies you
end up with said mr stuveysant with
unexpected philosophy this conduct
of conyers hasnt taken me so awfully
much by surprise i sort of smelled it
coming i never trusted him nor liked
him for that matter but he was your
friend and i didnt like to say anything
-nor would it have done any good i
guess i heard the other day he was

touting for sontags-

  you heard that from billy wate i
suppose 

  no i didnt it was from a hanger-
on at sontags he said conyers and
sontag had a row of some sort and
bust up-that would explain why he
wants to work in with delaney
why-does delaney run a game
surq not here but in albany
thats only one of the things he does
-so my friend the barkeep says
lorimer suddenly remembered that
miss walker had said there were people
in palestine who would not wish to see
the invincibles owned by delaney be-
cause of the undesirable element he
would bring into the league

  it was always a mystery to me how
conyers got a living pursued stu-
veysant but this touting game would
the prdgal



explain it im afraid he was taking
you round to sontags to be robbed
while pretending to be your friend
lorimer was silent he was no fool
no raw inexperienced youth and such
a possibility had occurred to him more
than once in the past but he had liked
conyers even against his better judg-
ment and had ceased to expect in
friends and acquaintances that standard
he once demanded

  stuveysant seeing the other was
averse to pursuing the matter changed
the subject by inquiring what he
thought of miss sands

  shes all right replied lorimer
heartily and even allowing for your
juvenile enthusiasm ill have to admit
theres a whole lot of the egyptian-
princess stuff about her

  for some reason mr stuveysant
failed to receive this unqualified ap-
proval with all the pleasure and pride
it merited instead he looked rather
gloomy

  youve become pretty good friends
with her havent you  he asked eying
the other sharply

  as much as i can i suppose on a
first acquaintance

  huh grunted mr stuveysant
that little miss walkers some looker
too he added with a sidelong glance
funny you hadnt noticed it of
course she cant compare with miss
sands though

  oh no replied lorimer absently
huh said mr stuveysant say
look here he added pulling at his tight
collar and manifesting signs of embar-
rassment ive-ive been sort of
thinking over what you said last night
-you know all that fine pulpit stuff
about toiling in the vineyard and hit-
ting the straight and narrow i thought
you were crazy and i asked you to put
the soft pedal on it but ive been mull-
ing it over and-and im beginning to
think there may be something in this
working game after all im getting

tired of carrying this around-eying
his imposing facade-and some work
might help me to lose it huh

  are you insinuating gracefully that
you actually want to go to work
asked lorimer incredulously

  now youre shouting said mr
stuveysant say cant you give me a
job no kidding look here i know
a whole lot about the game i captained
my sophomore team in the days before i
developed this anna held silhouette
with the reverse english you need a
ticket seller dont you well im the
best little ticket seller you ever saw
you need an office boy gatekeeper pri-
vate police force general cleaner-up
peanut vender adviser-in-ordinary
scoreboard marker bat boy mascot
well im all that and then some and
all for fifteen bucks per ill make it
ten

  you and a ten-a-week job ex-
claimed lorimer and what about
your future are you going to remain
a bat boy and mascot forever  do you
think princely salaries are floating about
in the palestine baseball club 

  see here said stuveysant seriously
my governor owns a business thats
worth a million if its worth a cent he
gave me the sacred order of the boot
because in plain english ive been a
confirmed loafer i preferred to fiddle
around and play the fool instead of
going into the office and doing a days
work you had a good job and knew
how to hold it before you decided to
jump the rails but i never earned my
salt since the day i was born thats
the truth lorimer and ive suddenly
become properly ashamed of it i dont
know why he finished ingenuously
it must be in the air up here

  it must be agreed lorimer so-
berly

  well pursued stuveysant ive
got to show the governor that i can
and will work so dont worry about
my future for its there waiting for me


the popular magazine

in the governors office whenever ive
shown myself worthy of it of course
he added hastily i dont want to im-
pose on you for a minute and if you
dont think ill make good or if you
cant see your way-

  far be it from me my boy to put
any obstacle in the way of a mans laud-
able ambition to labor said lorimer
go to it old scout

  you mean youll try me asked
stuveysant eagerly

  surest thing you know if the old
palestine baseball club never does an-
other thing but blow up added lori-
mer soberly it has been at least the
means of making you and me take a
tumble to ourselves and thats some-
thing i was beginning to think impos-
sible

   youre right said stuveysant as
soberly

  but was it the palestine baseball
club or was it merely the old yet ever
new story of a womans influence
both lorimer and stuveysant were con-
scious of the question

chapter viii

concerning an old zulu proverb

  the new field manager of the in-
vincibles appeared in the person of mr
bud magee erstwhile star backstop
of the long-defunct vespers this move
of lorimers astonished stuveysant and
caused him sincere emotion

  for the love of mike he ex-
claimed recollecting the gentleman with
the round black cannon-ball head who
had smelled reminiscently of a brewery
you cant mean that fellow why
lies a dead beat-

  theres a difference between being
dead broke and being a dead beat said
lorimer im going to give magee his
chance the one hes been waiting for
ive an idea hes just the man for the
job and ive had him in mind hes
had a bunch of trouble and that game

leg put him out of the only kind of job
he knew granted that he may not
have met hard luck like a hero but
neither did i for that matter i guess
this hero business isnt so all-fired easy
as it seems in storybooks anyway ive
faith in bud magee he has played all
round the bushes and knows the game
from soup to nuts whats more i
know he wont throw me and will do his
level best

  well said stuveysant looking dis-
tressed of course i dont know any-
thing about him while you evidently do
and id be the last to try and put a
crimp in any mans chance to make
good but i wouldnt bank on his mak-
ing good through gratitude if i were
you you know how conyers acted after
all you did for him and if bud ma-
gee is a drinker and not dependable
for-

  all the drinking he did was at free
lunches interrupted lorimer and
hell be dependable when he has some-
thing to be dependable for i know i
was all wrong about conyers but you
wait and see if i havent sized magee
up right

  and so against stuveysants sincere
and open opposition the wire was sent

  mr magee reported that same day
contrary to his former habit he had
evidently formed a recent and intimate
acquaintance with soap and water
while though lorimer had wired gen-
erous traveling expenses neither the
odor of the brewery nor distillery was
disseminated from the magee person
he must be holding his breath
thought stuveysant still highly skep-
tical funny i cant even smell
cloves

  when the proposition-which the
telegram had merely hinted at-was
fully oullined to him magees eager-
ness was almost pathetic nor did he
seem quite able to believe in his sudden
good fortune

  ill pay twenty-five a week said
the prcdigl



lorimer starting from to-day thats
fifteen less than clark got but its all
i can afford and it depends on the team
how long i can even pay that the
moneys got to be earned before you
get a raise magee ill put the situa-
tion right up to you i havent any
money nor any backing and all i can
expect is one crack at this game for if
i dont make good this coming season
the property will go under the hammer
ive put up all ive got and ill be in
debt before were well started im
staking all you understand on a single
throw

  now i dont expect you to do the
impossible and i dont want you to save
money where it should be spent you
know as well as i that a cheap team is
the dearest in the long run youve
got to weed out the present material
keep the good fire the bad and go after
new men and pay them their price you
know whats in the bushes far better
than i and i dont think youre any
slouch when it comes to swapping i
dont expect us to walk off with the pen-
nant but i do expect a team that will
give the public a run for its money

  i dont mean to teach you your busi-
ness and therell be no strings on you
i just want you to understand however
that your meal ticket and mine is repre-
sented by the invincibles and that its up
to us to get it out of them if they
make good your salary goes up if they
dont you and i will have to hunt an-
other job at the end of the season

  mr magee had listened a hand on
either knee and his mud-colored eyes
concentrated on his feet while at reg-
ular intervals he nodded the cannon-
ball head now he gave a final nod
and arose

  i get you mr lorimer he said
briefly in his foghorn voice say i
aint much on this talk stuff but youve
treated me white all through and say
i want you to know i aint forgettin it
if i dont make good-well you wont

have to fire me see for if i cant
manage a county-league team then ill
go lay down an die if there was
nothin to it but spendin coin you
could hire the new york nationals but
ill guarantee to round up the best
bunch of material we can get before
june and hammer em into line or my
name aint magee

  thats the idea said lorimer it
wont be any walk-over but you and i
magee are going to put even more than
our best into this thing and when that
happens somethings got to crack-and
it wont be us weve got a fine reputa-
tion behind the club-im not speaking
of the past few years-and theres no
reason on earth why it should stick in
the cellar of course somebody must
take to the cellar but it doesnt have
to be us it isnt that the other fellows
are so awfully good but that the in-
vincibles became so awfully rotten
under the old regime the players
contracts called for them to report in
mid-may this giving them but two
weeks practice before the opening
game more time was not needed for
under the active management of silas
q lorimer the team had become a well-
oiled machine being composed of men
who had played together season after
season and who only needed to run
the winters kinks out of their systems
preparatory to hearing the seasonal
command of play ball all this
however had changed necessarily and
unnecessarily after silas lorimer re-
linquished the helm the once capable
machine slowly disintegrated and fell
to pieces time being responsible for the
shelving of some players while the
clark-jellibond management had ac-
counted for others

  mcculley the captain-who followed
the trade of house painter eight months
of the year whenever he could find
a job-was now explaining something
of all this during his first interview
with the laconic magee


the cpocpulacr magazine

  the old man he said referring to
the late mr lorimer kept thinkin
hed be as good as ever and he told us
all the time hed soon be back on the
job the boys thought the world of
him and he could get more out of em
in two weeks than you could in two

months-

  well see about that put in magee
addressing his feet

  well continued mcculley we
stalled along hopin for the best and
thinkin the old man would be back
any day never believin hed gone away
to make a die of it then ryan the
manager quit after a run-in with this
jellibond article and this guy clark was
put in well clark soon got himself
disliked by the way he began bawling
us out when there was no call for it
he was always lookin for trouble and
pretty near findin it every time some
of the boys quit one after the other and
the rest got fightin among themselves
you know what that means to a team
between you and me clark run the
team like a drunk switchman at a junc-
tion-him and jellibond together if
theyd wanted to put it on the scrap
heap they couldnt have done it sooner
or better

  whats the new boss like he fin-
ished i hear hes a waster-

  dont believe all you hear said
magee still apparently addressing his
conspicuous feet never you mind
what hes like though i guess youll find
out mighty soon your orders are to
round up the bunch and report to-mor-
row ten sharp and the man thats
late gets docked see

  mcculley gasped but say we
dont start practice till the middle of

may-

  dont we we start the weedin out
to-morrow

  but say we aint paid only from the
fifteenth of may to the twentieth of
september thats all were supposed
to work for what were draggin down

and the rest of the times our own
during the past four years this two
weeks practice became a painful joke
but thats all we got and all we was
paid for you wont get nobody to
put in two months hard work for
nothin-

  say was you tryin to learn me
something asked mr magee with
real anxiety whos askin you to
work for nothing i aint askin you
to work at all unless you show me
youre better than any other guy i can
get for the same figure and that goes
all down the line see the boss aint
in this thing for his health and hes
goin to get somethin more out of it
than that or know the reason why the
bunch i sign on for the season goes
on the pay roll right off but gettin
there aint goin to be no cinch let me
tell you ive got to be shown and
shown hard see  my motto is two for
one every time-if i can get it

  well said mcculley taking a long
breath thats something like thats
the kind of talk ive been wantin to
hear these four years back when we
aint been drawin even flies theres
a lot of deadwood you gan pass up right
off and whats worth keepin will be
glad to hear that the new boss means
business

  thats his middle name said ma-
gee laconically youre goin to hear
somethin drop around here pretty
soon

  the two months training and prac-
tice without which nothing could be ex-
pected from a revamped team would
mean to lorimer in salaries alone some-
thing like three thousand dollars and
magees miss walkers and stuvey-
sants salaries would add over four hun-
dred more for he meant first thing
to raise the stenographers an additional
five per week putting his own living
expenses at the minimum of ten dollars
a week would mean another eighty
then there would be the necessary in-
the cfxrovigil



cidentals allowing a fair margin he
would need say four thousand-before
-receiving the first return on the invest-
ment half of this he had already in
hand but the other two thousand had
yet to be raised lorimer park was
pledged for all it would carry for ac-
cording to mr jepson it was a question
if it would bring ten thousand in the
open market lorimer had no reason
to doubt this statement as he had seen
the place for himself and knew some-
thing of local realty values the prop-
erty was situated necessarily on the out-
skirts and in the present stage of
palestines development useless for any-
thing but its present purpose a new
traction project however was mooted
which if carried through would raise
materially realty values in that section
and the measure would soon be brought
up in council

  like everything else lorimer found
the grounds in a neglected condition
the itinerant field keeper pop stry-
ker being only hired a few months or
so the clubhouse and fence surround-
ing the place the grand stand and
bleachers had been left virtually to the
tender mercies of the elements and the
village urchin during the off seasons

  it aint my fault said pop stryker
defensively i done the best i could
but i couldnt get nothin out of mr
jellibond it would ha took dynamite
to make him part with a cent he kept
sayin he hadnt no money to spend
while clark says not to worry for the
club was- goin plumb to jericho any-
way an nothin mattered the dress-
in room under the grand stand looks
like a sieve an most of them seats is
so rotten they aint worth fixin there
aint been a pint of paint spent on th
whole business since two years before
th old man-i mean your uncle sir-
quit

  the wonder to me is said lorimer
grimly addressing stuveysant who ac-
companied him on this tour of inspec-

tion not that the gate was so small
but that anybody came at all this place
isnt fit for a dog fight weve got to
have new and bigger stands for- the
opening game it would cost almost as
much in the long run to patch up these
old ones anyway if i could afford it

id put up a stadium of concrete-

  better wait first and see if you can
fill it advised stuveysant if i were
you id patch up the old ones and the
cheapest way you know how then
if things break right you can spread
yourself next season theres no sense

risking-

  im risking everything as it is in-
terrupted lorimer with finality no
this cheeseparing jjame wont do it
isnt the time for cautiousness either
everything depends on this season and
if we dont put our best foot foremost
there wont be any next season so far
as im concerned and you can bank on
that you cant draw money unless
youve got a winning club and a win-
ning club isnt framed in a dump like
this im going to give palestine the
very best i can and if it doesnt recip-
rocate it wont be my fault ill go
broke knowing i did my level best im
in up to the neck anyway and one
more header wont matter

  but you havent the money pro-
tested the other

  ill have it by the time i foot the
bill replied lorimer cheerfully
either that or ill be in jail the party
that wants the job will have to give me
ninety days

  well said stuveysant i guess
maybe youre right your argument
sounds logical but id hate being the
one to back it i certainly admire your
nerve

  you should laughed lorimer for
i bought it at sontags and it cost fifty
thousand

  one difficulty lorimer had not fore-
seen was encountered that saturday
evening when miss walker absolutely


the ppulr magazine

refused the addition to her salary no
mr lorimer she said flushing its
very kind of you but i really couldnt
its quite impossible thank you

  it was his turn to color i know its
not what youre worth miss walker
but its all i can pay just at present
the minute theres any income your sal-
ary is fixed at twenty-five in the mean-
time-

  in the meantime mr lorimer it
remains where it is thank you i can
get along on ten dollars a week quite
as well as mr stuveysant or yourself

-better i imagine-

  that isnt the point youre worth
more and economy doesnt have to start
with you it would make me feel more
comfortable if youd accept this until i
am in a position to pay what youre
worth

  the little stenographer looked dis-
tressed i wish you wouldnt talk that
way if you dont mind you know id
feel very uncomfortable if i took it
were working on borrowed capital
and every little bit helps youll find
me quite mercenary enough when once
somethings coming in and it isnt all
going out and it would look as if by
advising you not to sell i had planned

to profit-

  nonsense i know jellibond was
mean enough to suggest that but you
know not to mind what he says as
for the rest thats also nonsense you
dont have to worry where the money

comes from thats up to me-

  but i do all the same i cant help
it interrupted miss walker shaking
the amber curls i cant help feeling
that its up to me too i-i dont feel
just like an ordinary employee mr
lorimer and my interest in the busi-
ness isnt represented merely by what

it pays me-

  that goes without saying laughed
lorimer id hate to lose your serv-
ices miss walker but still in all fair-
ness i cant help saying i only wonder

you ever took such a position as this

your proper place is new york-

  where i might starve added the
girl dryly positions arent so easy
to find mr lorimer as you no doubt

know especially for a beginner-

  beginner

  yes i was only graduated this year
in the same class with miss sands and
when she learned of the stenographer
getting married and suggested my ap-
plying for the position i jumped at the
chance in saying i did not feel like
an ordinary employee i meant that i
cant forget it was mainly through me
you decided not to sell

  entirely through you miss walker
-and thats something no mere raise
in salary can repay id have taken de-
laneys best offer if you hadnt sent that
note for my one idea was to sell out
as soon as possible

  and if the whole thing should turn
out a gigantic failure exclaimed the
girl biting her lip then youd have
nobody to thank but me youd have
lost the six thousand you might have
had and youd end up in debt thats
why i cant consider myself just an
ordinary employee im responsible and
there are times when thinking it all
over i get horribly frightened to-
night even though believing you took
the right course i could almost side
with mr stuveysant against building
the new stands and putting your head

  now see here said lorimer
sternly youve got to stop thinking
those things or advising anything of the
kind im in this thing with both feet
and theres no going back just re-
member the old zulu proverb to go
forward is to die to go backward is
to die let us go forward well were
going forward but there wont be any
dying about it and any worrying that
must be done ill do understand
youre responsible for nothing but
opening my eyes in several ways and
the vcrocdigal



leaving me hopelessly in your debt
miss walker

  the girl turned away and busied her-
self with the filing cabinet as if to hide
the sudden rush of color that flooded
her face

  its-its very nice of you to say
that mr lorimer she remarked at
length in a low voice i-i dont feel
cowardly any more

chapter ix

some inside information

 the breach between lorimer and
conyers had opened into an abyss for
it was not in the formers nature to lie
down meekly under the slur cast upon
him by the other he sought conyers
out but hoping to the last that the other
had spoken to stuveysant hastily and
perhaps under provocation he was
willing even now to heal the breach to
give conyers the benefit of the doubt to
believe him other than the renegade
friend facts seemingly proved the
meeting took place in conyers new
quarters and in no sense did lorimer
bring to it an antagonistic or bitter
spirit rather that of conciliation

  well whats all this about any-
way he began i heard from stu-
veysant of course that you lit out be-
cause you were sore at me and i un-
derstand you repeated to him that id
ditched delaney and yourself now
you know thats nonsense conyers i
feel there must have been a misunder-
standing or that you said what you
didnt mean-

  did i broke in the other well
youve got another think coming im
through with both stuveysant and you
understand and you neednt be com-
ing around here trying to smooth things
over you gave me a rotten deal lori-

  you are stating a deliberate lie con-
yers and you know it you never be-
lieved for a moment youd the authority
b

to close the deal you simply couldnt
do-

  i could and did shouted the other
there was no written agreement but
you gave me a distinct and emphatic

verbal one-

  i did nothing of the kind stu-
veysant was there at the time and he

knows-

  stuveysant sneered conyers
that bloated lickspittle yes of
course hell say whatever you want him
to hell say anything if you pay him
enough talk as much as you like
but you sold the club and you meant to
sell it and now after putting me in
wrong youre crawling out because i
cant show a written agreement
lorimer picked up his hat and arose
we neednt pursue this further he
said youve been quite an eye opener
to me mr conyers i didnt want to
believe you a liar and a blackguard but
now let me tell you that youre both
the other was instantly on his feet

you say im a liar-

  a most infernal one nodded lori-
mer and a blackguard mr conyers
you sold me out to delaney as i dare
say you sold me to sontag oh yes
you neednt take up that virtuous out-
raged attitude it may go down with
those who dont know you but it doesnt
impose on me i know quite well why
you suddenly discovered that stuvey-
sant and i were no longer fit associ-
ates we were all right so long as our
money lasted if id sold to delaney
youd have got your split and id have
had six thousand for you to help me
spend you threw me over for dela-
ney the man with the full purse well
make the most of it i wish him joy
of such a friend as you

  conyers heavy face had become col-
orless while the malice and hatred that
glared from his eyes was positively de-
moniac almost unconsciously as if
his twitching fingers craved something
on which to spend their restless energy


the popular magazine

his hairy hand had sought and found
the heavy poker from the old-fashioned
fireplace and now as he sat and stared
umvinkingly at lorimer the impromptu
weapon gripped so that his knuckles
showed white his lip curled back over
his large strong teeth the big head sunk
between the heavy shoulders he was
startlingly suggestive of a gorilla at bay
-the king of the forest waiting club
in hand to strike so startling was the
sudden resemblance so menacing the
picture that lorimer instinctively
backed a step toward the door

  at length conyers spoke his voice
thick and unnatural with long pauses
between the words youre a brave
man-or a fool-mr lorimer to come
into my rooms and say what you have
a very brave man or a very great fool
i think perhaps neither of us have
really known each other i always
knew you were a fool but never until
recently such a thoroughly dishonorable

and unprincipled little beggar-

here he seemed to become aware of the
poker for the first time and he re-
turned it to the fireplace his move-
ments stealthy and animallike the ac-
tion almost surreptitious seemed to
restore his self-command for he got
up leisurely the old cynical smile again
in evidence

  youve been quite entertaining mr
lorimer he laughed but dont pre-
sume too far on my good nature run
along now before you get hurt we
know what we think of each other-
or what you pretend to think of me-
so there wont be any necessity of fur-
ther visits of this sort

  no said lorimer there wont
the momentary alarm produced by the
others startlingly menacing attitude had
vanished before the resurgence of his
native courage and he looked at con-
yers a new light in his now metallic
eyes i want you to understand he
finished that i meant every word i
said and that ill continue saying it

whether your natures good or bad
and its not what i pretend to think
but what by your own dishonorable
actions youve made me think and
as a final word i dont scare worth a
cent mr conyers-not even for
pokers

  conyers had grown colorless again
but he made no reply and after a final
protracted stare lorimer turned lei-
surely on his heel and passed from the
room

  the interview had indeed proved an
eye opener it was not so much thought
lorimer that he had proved the im-
mediate falsity of his so-called friend
but that conyers had shown such malice
and hatred from the start he would
never forget how the other had looked
at him while he sat gripping the poker
such unutterable venom such deep and
abiding hatred had glared from those
eyes as seemed out of all proportion
to the cause it seemed immeasurably
more than that which should be induced
by hearing the unflattering truth in-
deed conyers whole conduct was en-
tirely incomprehensible he could al-
most believe that the others mind had
become deranged through various ex-
cesses

  although lacking concrete proof
lorimer now felt satisfied that a sus-
tained and deliberate effort had been
made by delaney to secure lorimer
park and the palestine club from
what he learned from mcculley and
other sources it seemed clear that clark
-known locally by the delectable name
of biff-had done his best to make
the property worthless so that he-lor-
imer-would be only too glad to find
a purchaser mr jellibond had ably
abetted the scheme consciously or un-
consciously  for whether he was merely
grossly incompetent and none too hon-
est or thoroughly unprincipled all the
way through was still susceptible of
proof at all events like clark he was
on intimate terms with delaney the
the pxrovigal



more so since being despoiled of his
vested rights

  it was from sammy brown of the
palestine journal-whom lorimer had
met through wate-that he learned
something further of the enemies he
had made

  delaneys had his eye on lorimer
park for some time said brown you
know of course that he and a few
others are the men behind brand 
co the biggest realty and development
concern in the county

  no thats news said lorimer feel-
ing he was going to hear some inside
facts worth listening to

  this fellow brand added brown
is only a dummy and the men behind
the show are delaney jepson and

wishart-

  not jepson of the guaranty 
title co and wishart of the bank
sure nodded brown those
three always pull together of course
youd have a hard time proving wish-
arts active interest for hes not sup-
posed to have any outside the bank
youll find that the palestine  em-
pire bank has a good deal to say in
this town and that it has a lively finger
in everything that pays delaney jep-
son and wishart own four-fifths of the
stock youve heard too of this new
traction project

  lorimer nodded ive been sort of
banking on it they say it will raise
property values out that way fifty per

  if the bill goes through-which it
wont

  why not i understood there was
every prospect of it

  up to the time there was every
prospect of you selling out grinned
the reporter delaney jepson and
wishart can get about anything they
want from the council if they only
want it hard enough and they fathered
the bill-through a dummy of course
and with the usual hot air about prog-

ress benefiting the public and all that
by the time the bill would be passed
they had every reason to expect that
brand  co would own lorimer park
then when the new trolley went
through and the railway people had
been convinced it was just the place
to have their new station the building
boom would be  for fair and lorimer
park would be cut up into lots and sold
piecemeal you see brand  co own
quite a bit out that way they bought
and foreclosed on mortgages knowing
theyd put through this development
scheme some day and the situation
of lorimer park-as you can see by
the map-makes it the tenderloin in
the steak they own all round it and
they dont intend you or anybody else
to walk off with the choicest morsel
-made choice by their efforts its nec-
essary to them anyway for the cutting
through of streets and avenues lori-
mer park as it stands to-day isnt worth
much but lorimer park plus brand 
co plus the trolley and railway-well
you know what main street realty is
fetching a square foot

  i see nodded lorimer then
delaney told nothing but the truth when
he said he only wanted lorimer park
not the franchise

  brown grinned again it was one
of those half truths that do the business
of a lie he wanted both he intended
using other property that he owns for
the ball grounds property over on the
west side thats hopeless and always
will be because of the colored settle-
ment he knew he could make the
club pay and he aimed to kill two birds
with the one brick

  of course finished brown youll
keep all this quiet and for that matter
perhaps i shouldnt say it for ive no
concrete proof but its pretty gener-
ally believed that delaney had his eye
on the invincibles even in your uncles
time and i honestly think clark had
his orders to put the team on the bum


the popular magazine

no doubt if not actual orders there
was some understanding and an agree-
ment as to his permanent management
of the club when delaney bought it
clark is no farmer and he knows darn
well how to run a ball team if he only
wants to

  i know youre right nodded lori-
mer i remember clarks last words
to me were that hed be running the
invincibles when i was panhandling on
broadway he seemed absolutely cer-
tain of it-

  sure delaney thought he had a
ripe tiling in you the word came in
that all you wanted was money that
you were a waster and all the rest of
it theres no doubt too that this
fellow conyers sold you out cold first
crack evidently he told delaney you
were hard up and couldnt afford to
hold on no matter how you might bluff
i wouldnt be surprised if they cooked
up this written-agreement game in the
hope of scaring you out by threats of
a lawsuit if you couldnt be jollied out
they thought you were an easy mark
and didnt know enough to keep your-
self warm

  well they know better now
grinned lorimer

  yes said brown youve given
them a jolt all right but they know
from conyers what your resources are
and they think youll have to quit be-
lieve me you have the whole bunch
against you and that traction bill will
never go through while you own lori-
mer park you can make your mind
up right now to that aside from all
else they arent aiming to increase the
borrowing capacity of your collateral
they hope youve bitten off more than
you can chew and youll find that tilings
wont be made any too pleasant for you
in this town i dont mean to say
understand that any one of them is a
crook but all the same its funny how
much dirty work can be done in the
name of business even by men who

pride themselves  being models of all
the virtues so long as they dont do
it actually themselves why they go
to it with an easy conscience its
certain that bunch doesnt want to see
you make a success of the club and the
sooner you have to sell out and quit
the town the better theyll like it
well said lorimer i certainly
hate to disoblige anybody but theyll
have to make the best of it for here
i am and here i propose to remain
lorimer knew that the journal
owned by sammys father was an in-
exorable political opponent of delaney
who held a prominent position in the
town council but whether browns
confidence had been prompted by
friendship for himself or enmity to-
ward the bunch made little differ-
ence  the main thing was its trustworthi-
ness and he meant to profit by it
without loss of time he had meant to
pledge the franchise with jepson or
wishart toward the deficit in his cap-
ital for running expenses but now he
would take no chances

  you were right he said to miss
walker recounting all brown had said
the ramifications of this town go
deeper than i thought for id no idea
jepson wishart and delaney were vir-
tually the one person so far as business
is concerned

  nor i she replied you cant
find these things out except from the
inside but its what i was afraid of
of course said lorimer  may
be shying at a windmill but all the
same im not going to take any
chances the fact remains that jepson
is brand  co and that means dela-
ney and wishart too if i failed they
could get lorimer park for a song and
sing it themselves as you said at the
start its just as well for somebody to
hold the mortgages who would have no
interest in giving me trouble its
becoming increasingly clear miss
walker he finished with a laugh
the cfrodigal



that your advice is worth following
it would have saved me time and
money if i had taken it in this instance
at the start

  miss walkers only reply was a flush
indeed it was rather remarkable how
of late she colored up whenever lori-
mer said anything of a complimentary
or personal nature this fact how-
ever he had quite failed to observe or
if he had he would have thought
merely that she had been working too
hard and was perhaps overnervous
for he had never made a study of the
sex and believed like others equally
ignorant that the subject was very
complex and quite beyond the under-
standing of the average male

chapter x

a months progress

  a month had passed and an albany
firm now held the mortgages on lori-
mer park and the pledged franchise
while an albany bank looked after the
lorimer finances such as they were
whatever delaney jepson and wish-
art thought of this unexpected move
they kept it to themselves but it may
be presumed their thoughts were not of
the pleasantest indeed mr jepson
lost something of his mild religious
look during the transaction and spoke
quite peevishly while mr wishart
found occasion to remark on the brief
existence of the banks new account

  im sorry mr lorimer he said
pointedly that we seem unable to ac-
commodate you here in palestine what
seems to be the trouble

  why there isnt any replied lori-
mer none in the world mr wish-
art and more he would not say

  it was from gabriel owen that lori-
mer sought and obtained the introduc-
tion to the albany firm the old lawyer
thawing perceptibly when he found that
 more than an introduction was
asked for he had a suspicion that

lorimer might want him to go on a
note

  so youve decided to manage the
property yourself  he asked eying the
other curiously how are you get-
ing on

  first rate thanks

  well work seems to agree with
you observed mr owen youre
looking much better than when i first
saw you by the way i understand
that miss sands has taken up her res-
idence in palestine i suppose you have
met her

  oh yes miss sands and i have
become quite good friends

  ive had the pleasure of meeting
her pursued mr owen a very fine
young woman sir

  very fine indeed agreed lorimer
the old lawyer chuckled and the
terms of your uncles bequest how
are they getting  may i ask 

  theyre exactly where they were at
our first interview mr owen smiled
lorimer and theyll still be there
at the end of the five years miss sands
and i reached an immediate under-
standing about that

  mr owen had a tussle with the har-
ried whiskers its a pity so much
money should go to a charity that
doesnt need it he remarked you
could do a lot with it i dare say at
the present moment

  i could mr owen i could also
do a lot if somebody elected me pres-
ident of the united states one is just
as likely to happen as the other

  five years is a long time and you
never can tell mr lorimer you have
met miss sands and your uncle seemed
confident of the rest i hope anyway
youre going to make a success of the
palestine club i hear youve been at-
tempting great things personally i
wish your uncle had seen his way to
leave you some working capital-but
then you must remember that he be-
lieved you wealthy


the cpocpulacr magazine

  yes said lorimer soberly and if
hed only known the real state of my
affairs i wouldnt have figured any-
where in his will im quite sure about
that i cant help feeling sometimes
that i got my inheritance under false
pretenses

  dont let that worry you replied
the old lawyer with the nearest ap-
proach to cordiality which his cautious
and unemotional nature could evince
you pretended to nothing mr lori-
mer your uncles ignorance of your
affairs is explained by the fact that he
spent the last year of his life in a sani-
tarium and was forbidden to read the
newspapers besides from all ac-
counts he finished with a chuckle
your inheritance is nothing to brag
about if it ever amounts to anything
you can thank yourself i imagine and
not your uncle four thousand isnt
much of a working capital my boy and
all borrowed money at that youre
taking a big risk

  oh well said lorimer i can only
lose the four thousand once and theres
nothing like trying

  as on the occasion of their first in-
terview mr owen remained for some
time staring at the door after lorimer
had gone i like that boy he con-
fessed at length to his whiskers upon
my word i do i think hell come
mighty near making a success of things
he deserves to anyway and so he
lias become quite good friends with
miss sands here something seemed
to tickle mr gabriel owen exceedingly
for he lay back and laughed until the
tears came to his eyes

  meanwhile the invincibles were ex-
periencing an arduous revamping a
process which extended to lorimer
park itself and everything connected
with the club the new stands were
in process of erection lorimer  a
small first payment being given ninety
days by a local firm this meant that
he neednt meet the bill until the first

week in july by which time if the
enterprise was to succeed at all he
would be in an ample position to do so

  magee contrary to stuveysants be-
lief was proving an agreeable disap-
pointment and there was a sustained
quality in his work that could not be
accounted for wholly by self-interest or
the bait of increased salary he was
a dry file a hard-bitten individual in
many ways but gratitude was not one
of the qualities lacking in his compo-
sition added to this was the pride of
an ex-star of the inter-state league

  hard work can do much but it was
the spirit of lorimer that actuated the
whole machine acting indeed as a main-
spring for as magee had predicted
mcculley and the rest were not long
left in doubt concerning the character
of the new boss he never inter-
fered with magee but he was present
every day at the grounds with a keen
and critical eye for the workmen en-
gaged on the new stands and the play-
ers themselves

  it was about this time too that lori-
mer as his intimacy with phyllis sands
increased began to come in for several
sly digs from miss walker it was
a subject of which she never seemed
to tire and being a privileged em-
ployee she said more or less what she
pleased

  its too bad she began abruptly
one night as lorimer and she were
working alone that your uncles stupid
will should keep you and miss sands
apart

  why laughed lorimer i dont
believe its keeping us very much apart
we see each other most every day you
know

  no i dont know

  well we do

  oh do you there had been a
sudden drop in the temperature but
lorimer was sublimely unconscious of
it

  yes he continued i even had the
the prodigal



privilege last night of dining at the
lorimer homestead

   indeed said miss walker without
enthusiasm it must have been quite
nice to find yourself in the house
where your uncle was born was mr
stuveysant there too im sure if
miss sands had happened to mention
to me that she had invited some one
else besides my poor self id have made
a special effort to go

  why i suppose she took it for
granted you knew miss walker that

id tell you i was going-

  that wouldnt have made any dif-
ference mr lorimer you going
wouldnt have been any inducement
bless me no laughed lorimer
we see quite enough of each other
without going to miss sands house
oh quite she agreed biting her
lip perhaps too much if it comes
to that

   he eyed her sharply and then turned
to his desk dont you feel quite
well he asked at length with real
solicitude

  perfectly thank you why

  i-i dont know i thought perhaps
you were working too hard somehow
you-you seem quite snappish this even-
ing

   thank you she said sweetly

   i didnt mean that he added has-
tily i meant you wfere overnervous
overtired you must take a vacation
miss walker committed a violent and
unprovoked assault on the inoffensive
typewriter as if to demonstrate her
entire physical fitness when she came
to the end of the paragraph she said
very distinctly i shall not take a
vacation

   then to his surprise she suddenly
dimpled

  i am snappish mr lorimer but
please ignore my bad temper she said
humbly i may as well confess that
i am in a bad temper because i wasnt
at miss sands last night while-

while- she faltered and stopped

short

  while i was finished lorimer

  up went miss walkers brows while
she laughed unaffectedly

  you oh dear no why you
mr lorimer dont we see quite
enough of each other here

  he stared at her feeling quite fool-
ish uncomfortable and embarrassed
the-the only other guest there was
mr stuveysant he stammered

  miss walker turned away covered
with blushes and in obvious maidenly
confusion

  he stared at the back of her white
neck where it showed between the
turndown collar and the riot of amber
curls he took his pipe mechanically
from the desk and paused with it half-
way to his mouth while the match
burned down to his fingers and was
finally flung aside- he had become very
quiet he sat motionless his eyes con-
centrated in an absent stare

  for some unaccountable reason all
miss walkers snappishness had van-
ished and she was even humming
blithely one of the latest broadway suc-
cesses while to all intents and purposes
her interest was concentrated on the
morrows pay roll

  at length lorimer shook himself like
one who has experienced an unexpected
and uncomfortable shock would you
mind stopping that singing he asked
abruptly i cant hear myself think

  the humility and sweetness with
which miss walker received this un-
complimentary remark was worthy an
early christian martyr oh im so
sorry i didnt know you were think-
ing its an atrocious bad habit of
mine but i never knew you objected
to it

  well i dont as a rule he admitted
grudgingly now rather ashamed of his
rudeness but-but somehow it gets
on my nerves to-night

  miss walker nodded the amber curls


the cpocpulr magazine

and eyed him solicitously youre
overnervous overworked mr lorimer
thats whats the matter you must
take a vacation

  he eyed her suspiciously

  so you see she added anxiously
its not i but you who are over-
worked and who needs the vacation
i dont need anything of the kind
he retorted indignantly its not my
nerves at all but that silly song you
were humming he turned abruptly
to his desk but in another moment
jumped up and reached for his hat

  ive-ive a business engagement
ive just remembered i wont be back
do you mind staying alone if so
leave that work till the morning

  oh im not afraid said miss
walker meekly why should i

  i dont know i thought perhaps
you might anyway mr stuveysant
i dare say will drop in later and see
you home this was said quite
viciously

  the little stenographer flushed be-
comingly again and manifested all the
former symptoms of maidenly confu-
sion oh i-i couldnt think of
troubling mr stuveysant she mur-
mured with shy downcast eyes

  huh mumbled lorimer stalking
to the door

  she waited until his quick nervous
steps died away then jumped up
clapped her hands and began a very
dainty and graceful little dance about
the room

  in the midst of this the door opened
and the new office boy otherwise mr
stuveysant entered

chapter xi

mr stuveysant decides that every-
body is crazy but himself

  wheres rummy 

  who i dont know any person by
that name if you mean air lorimer
hes just gone home

  you dont fancy the name rummy
i do not said miss walker em-
phatically just as i dont fancy the
name fatty i should think mr lori-
mer and you could find nicer names
to call each other than those they
may have been appropriate once but
certainly not now

  why do you think im getting any
thinner asked mr stuveysant eagerly
honestly now miss walker take
a good look and he revolved slowly
like a football on its axis

  well she said critically certainly
you are not getting any fatter

  this was the strict truth mr stu-
veysant having long since passed the
superlative stage

  but surely you werent born with
the name fatty she added surely
you have another name mr stuvey-
sant

  well said the office boy doubt-
fully ive a dim recollection of be-
ing called horace in the days of my
innocent young childhood

  horace is a nice name pronounced
the stenographer decidedly its ever
so much nicer than fatty and by
the way its the name of miss sands
favorite poet 

  honestly asked mr stuveysant
brightening perceptibly miss sands
is awfully strong on this highbrow stuff
isnt she and yet she isnt a bit stuck
up or pedantic shes just as nice as
she can be

  she is agreed miss walker im
awfully fond of her

  som i blurted out stuveysant i
mean-er-i mean-hum-i mean i
know youre awfully fond of each
other miss walker thats it thats
what i meant he finished perspiring
freely

  miss walker had turned to her desk
and seemed quite oblivious of the slip
a fact which mr stuveysant duly ap-
preciated well he added breathing
easier ill dodge along now seeing
the prdgal



rummy-i mean mr lorimer-wont
be back

why have you an engagement
n-no not exactly stuveysant
shifted his weight to the other foot
but i was sort of figuring on stopping

in at the lorimer homestead-

  and im figuring on you staying
here till im finished interrupted the
stenographer calmly

but-but i virtually promised miss

sands- you see shes awfully keen

on roses and thats one thing i do
happen to know something about

were planning a dandy flower bed-

the dandy flower bed can wait
said miss walker inexorably do you
think im going to stay here alone

you know very well im afraid-

  bless me of what this towns
as good as a church it wouldnt know
how to be bad if it wanted to

  i dont care im afraid of the dark
and the trees and the strange noises
you dont know how many creepy
noises there are when ones working
here alone lots of times i think some
ones creeping round the house and try-
ing to peep in the window ugh it
makes me shiver when i think of it
im afraid of that man clark too for
he blames me for his being discharged

im afraid of mr jellibond-

  of old jellybags fiddlesticks
said stuveysant you know youre
talking nonsense id like to see the
person or thing that youre afraid of
youre trying to kid me miss walker
you know very well rummy-mr lor-
imer-wouldnt have left you here alone
if you were afraid or if there was
anything to be afraid of

  mr lorimer had to leave because
he wasnt feeling well and he wouldnt
care in the least whether i was afraid
or not said miss walker plaintively
i only consented to stay here because
he said you would be here to see me
home

  see-see you home

  yes mr stuveysant-see me home
so you see the dandy flower bed will
have to wait you cant by flattering
my courage humor me into letting you
off and if my maidenly fears fail to
appeal to your masculine chivalry then
i must tell you that part of an office
boys duties consist in seeing home the
stenographer whenever she has to work
late oh yes thats so any regular
office boy will tell you that however
they are not my orders but mr lori-
mers so youll have to make the best
of it

  well grinned stuveysant if its
the boss orders that settles it and i
yield with characteristic grace and
sweetness but how long do you figure
on being here he finished anxiously

  why that all depends on yourself
mr stuveysant the more entertain-
ing you are the faster and better i
can work and if you are very enter-
taining its quite possible i may be
through in time for you to have a go
at the plans of the dandy flower bed
im the best little entertainer you
ever saw miss walker thats part of
my protean role said stuveysant
briskly what shall it be

  why just talk to me

but how can you work if  talk
excellently thats one of my many
peculiarities which mr lorimer cant
understand i value the infrequent op-
portunity of indulging in it

  and what shall i talk about

oh anything it doesnt matter in
the least suppose-well suppose you
tell me how you and mr lorimer met
why said stuveysant there isnt
anything to tell we just met

  that isnt very entertaining youll
have to do better than that if you are
to see the plans of the dandy flower bed
to-night remarked miss walker over
her shoulder while she frowned at a
column of figures above which her pen-
cil was hovering how did you meet 
did you know mr lorimer-seven and


the cpocpulacr magazine

six are thirteen and nine are twenty-
two-did you know him before you
both went into the prodigal business

  no said stuveysant you see i
was sort of born into the prodigal busi-
ness but lorimer wasnt i guess a lot
of people have wondered at the way
he took hold of things here the way
he developed all of a sudden into a
first-class business man i wondered
myself until i found out that up till
two years ago he was traveler for a big
new york dry-goods house-in fact
one of the best men young as he was
they had he was a whale of a suc-
cess then you see hes a yale man
too and managed the varsity baseball
team in his senior year-and a rattling
good team it was too walked off with
about everything in sight that season
i was at harvard then so i remember
but i didnt know lorimer at that time
didnt remember the name until he told
me about managing the yale varsity
we didnt really know each other until
we met in a new york club last year

  seven and eight are fifteen mur-
mured the stenographer nibbling the
end of the hovering pencil but you
havent told me why mr lorimer
stopped being a whale of a success and
became a prodigal

  why just after his father died he

had a bunch of trouble his-

stuveysant stopped abruptly i cant
tell you miss walker at least i feel
i shouldnt lorimer told me all about
it one night but in confidence you
might say and ive no business to pass
it on

  no said miss walker absently and
indifferently though she looked acutely
disappointed why now you really
make me inquisitive mr stuveysant
i want to know i really think i could
finish this work out of hand if you
told me come now remember the
dandy flower bed

  impossible sighed stuveysant

  i cant bribe you

  not a little bit miss walker much
as i would like to oblige you i dont
pretend to any virtue you know but
this is something that its none of my
business to repeat to any one and that
settles it

  im sure you would tell this won-
derful mystery to miss sands said
miss walker plaintively you know
you would

  i would not and theres  mys-
tery about it its merely lorimers
private affair which if he wants it
known and discussed up here hell tell
himself

  miss walker pouted becomingly and
then swung round in her chair from
the first stuveysant and she had got 
very well meeting  the common
ground of badinage and flippancy un-
derneath which was a mutual liking and
respect for as in lorimers case she
had penetrated the mask of the fool in
motley glimpsing something of the real
man beneath and now instead of
showing anger at this uncompromising
failure of her deftly executed attempt
at pumping mr stuveysant she re-
garded him with frank liking and ap-
proval i can congratulate mr lori-
mer on at least one of his friends
she said quite gravely with a little bow
you have treated my impertinent curi-
osity as to mr lorimers private af-
fairs exactly as it deserved

  stuveysant was considerably per-
plexed by this sudden change of front
he never quite knew when miss
walker was serious or making elab-
orate fun of him-a state of mind by
no means unknown to lorimer him-
self youre not mad-honestly he
asked

  not a bit of it she laughed to
prove it my work is finished and im
going to let you escape the arduous
duty of escorting me home-just be-
cause youve been so entertaining run
along now and attend to the dandy
flower bed youll be in ample time
the cprodigal



  no said stuveysant ill see you
home i meant to anyway you know
i couldnt think of accepting the sac-
rifice mr stuveysant id much
rather you wouldnt its quite unnec-
essary and it was all nonsense what i

said about being frightened-

  a slight noise which seemed to come
from the direction of the door arrested
her and mechanically she followed
stuveysants pointing finger the door
handle was turning slowly almost
noiselessly but being fastened by a
patent catch the door could only be
opened from without by a key if the
catch were not rendered inoperative

  stuveysant signaling her to be silent
tiptoed across the room but for all his
elaborate caution the boards protested
loudly under his vast weight he moved
with surprising celerity for one of his
bulk but quick though he was when
he flung open the door there was noth-
ing to greet him but the dark empty
vestibule giving on the street he went
out and looked up and down the side-
walk but there was no one in sight
nothing to excite his suspicion

  who do you suppose that was he
asked returning to the office

  miss walker shrugged oh some
one to see mr lorimer on business i
suppose no doubt they happened to

be passing and seeing the light-

  then why didnt they wait and give
a fellow a chance to open the door
why didnt they knock why did they
hike off like that and i dont like
the way that handle turned-too darned
quiet and secretive if you should ask
me supposing that catch hadnt hap-
pened to be down and youd been here
alone

  miss walker laughed gayly as she
pinned on her hat but a close observer
would have seen that her hand shook
slightly and if i had been alone
why you know this town is as good
as a church and wouldnt know how
to be bad if it wanted to thats not

sarcasm mr stuveysant what is
there to be afraid of who would
break in here

 certainly not for money he
grinned eying the old-fashioned safe
in the corner wed give em half of
all they could find and pay a bonus
to boot lets hope there may be some-
thing worth stealing in that safe some
day if not now

  theres exactly five hundred in it
at this present moment said the ste-
nographer dryly you forget this is
friday

  holy mackerel yes exclaimed stu-
veysant i was forgetting that

  for every friday lorimer made the
thirty-mile trip to albany for the
weekly pay roll and thus for one night
in the week friday the old safe em-
phatically held something worth the
taking

  thats one of the disadvantages of
not banking in the town said miss
walker lightly but of course no-
body but you mr lorimer and my-
self know there is ever such a sum
there

  you never can tell how these things
may get about remarked stuveysant
shaking his head they know lori-
mer withdrew his account from the
palestine  empire and that its the
only bank in town they know he
goes to albany every friday and they
can add two and two together

  and who are they laughed the
stenographer she was kneeling by
the safe her back to him replacing
some papers she had been consulting
in her work

  stuveysant shrugged this town
may be as good as a church but it
has its undesirable citizens like any
other ive noticed quite a few about
and you know as well as i that weve
made enemies theres no use fooling
ourselves about that

  fie surely youre not suggesting
that eminent citizens like mr delaney


the popular magazine

jepson wishart and jellibond-not to
mention your old and immaculate
friend mr conyers-would stoop to
burglary

  he echoed her laugh all the
same he said with a troubled look
i dont half like the idea of five hun-
dred dollars staying here even for one
night even if no outsider does know
about it when you come right down
to it that safe is nothing but an old
sardine box and any regular cracks-
man could do the trick with a can
opener

  well said the girl indifferently
closing and locking the safe i confess
that some such idea occurred to me
and last week i suggested to mr lori-
mer that he rent a deposit box in the
palestine  empire where he could
keep the pay roll overnight but he
couldnt see it that way at all he
laughed at me said this wasnt new
york and that i had too vivid an im-
agination and of course hes right
she finished arising and brushing her
skirt so we neednt say anything more
about it

  miss walker still insisted that stu-
veysant should not escort her home
adding that on no account would she
wish him to be late for his engage-
ment with miss sands her protests
and arguments however were of no
avail and thus it was almost nine oclock
when stuveysant at length presented
himself at the lorimer homestead as
it was still called in palestine

  there was a decidedly chilly look in
miss sands dark eyes though she
smiled sweetly oh is it you mr
stuveysant she asked with evident
surprise really  wasnt expecting
you

  why-why you know this was the
night we were to go over the plans
of the flower bed protested stuvey-
sant you said friday-

  did i she asked ingenuously
oh yes so i did and i think i

also said eight oclock didnt i it
is now nine mr stuveysant

  im awfully sorry miss sands you
see i had to stop in at the office to
see lorimer but hed left and then
i saw miss walker home she was

working late you know-

  no i dont know said miss sands
sweetly but emphatically and i sup-
pose it is one of your many arduous
duties mr stuveysant to keep miss
walker company when shes working
late and then to see her home

  oh yes thats one of the duties of
any regular office boy he laughed

  how interesting she murmured
stifling a yawn

  a long and almost harrowing silence
followed during which mr stuveysant
contrived to look quite miserable
then a happy thought struck him
miss walker didnt want me to see
her home he explained anxious to
clear up the situation and do full jus-
tice to all concerned it isnt her fault
that im late she said she didnt want

me to be late-

  how thoughtful of her laughed
miss sands with the utmost good hu-
mor as if it really mattered in the
least

  another silence followed the ther-
mometer had fallen to zero while the
visitor vainly racked his brains for
some enlivening subject of conversa-
tion finally miss sands yawned pro-
digiously and shamelessly

  im so sleepy she apologized eying
the clock

  it was here that for the first time
mr stuveysant was assailed with a
vague suspicion that perhaps he should
take his leave about the plans of
the flower bed he began desperately

shall we-

  oh said she sweetly theyll keep
some night when you dont have to
work so hard mr stuveysant you
must be very tired

  but im not not in the least-
the cpcrocdigal



  oh yes you are-and so am i
said miss sands emphatically

  and so stuveysant presently found
himself walking homeward wondering
what exactly had happened to make
miss sands act so strangely she cer-
tainly was out of sorts he reflected
gloomily but i havent done anything
and she shouldnt take it out of me
even the empire house modest
though it was had proved too expen-
sive for the curtailed financial program
of lorimer and stuveysant and long
since they had moved to a boarding
house quite as humble as that patronized
by little miss walker here they
shared a single room and practiced
assiduously all forms of mean econo-
mies for even in palestine it was no
easy matter to live on ten dollars a
week especially for ex-prodigals often
lorimer writhed inwardly when he
thought of the auspicious occasion
his climax of asininity when every
cent now loomed as big as a wagon
wheel what would he not have given
for that last remnant of his fortune
which he had squandered in one final
reckless burst of stupid folly

  stuveysant now found his friend
busily engaged on one form of their
mutual economies with the assistance
of a little gas stove a smuggled iron
and an improvised board he was press-
ing his trousers while various articles
of the nights wash decorated the
room this was the secret of the im-
maculate appearance stuveysant and he
always managed to present to pales-
tine

  after you on the iron my dear al-
phonse greeted stuveysant preparing
to imitate the others state of negligee
how are you feeling old man
same as usual why

  miss walker was saying you had to
quit because you werent feeling
well

  here lorimer probably burned his
fingers for he swore fluently thats

merely miss walkers vivid imagina-
tion he snapped do i look as if
i were dodging the undertaker i left
the office because i wanted to thats
all

 sick him fritz he bit your
mother quoted stuveysant with a
grin everybodys got a grouch to-
night whats up anyway

  butter and eggs i suppose replied
lorimer shortly so you stopped in
at the office

 uh-huh at the lorimer home-
stead too for a moment after seeing
miss walker home

  lorimer glared at the inoffensive
trousers and gave them a resounding
thump

  say added stuveysant somebody
tried the door when we were in the
office to-night do you think its safe
to leave the pay roll there and i
dont like the idea of miss walker

working there late alone-

  oh dont you well theres noth-
ing to stop you mounting guard over
her is there

  gee but youve a grouch pro-
tested stuveysant everybodys crazy
to-night guess ill go out in the gar-
den and eat a worm

        chapter xii
        lorimers past

  on the way to the office early the
following morning the first person lor-
imer met was peter delaney since
their memorable interview they had met
often as was inevitable in so small a
town as palestine but whereas mr
jellibond now crossed the street if he
saw lorimer though pretending no
such person existed delaney always
went out of his way to give lorimer
a nod a passing word and one of his
famous facial disturbances appar-
ently so far as he was concerned the
unhappy incident promoted by morti-
mer conyers was dead and buried and


the pocpulacr magazine

he treasured no animus apparently no
one more than mr delaney watched
with greater interest the proceedings
at lorimer park and wished the re-
juvenated palestine ball club greater
success whether he was sincere in
these friendly overtures was quite an-
other matter but lorimer whatever
his thoughts met him on the same foot-
ing and returned smile for smile

  morning greeted delaney pausing
in his waddle arid looking almost star-
tling without his perpetual smile
well its tough luck mr lorimer
hope you didnt lose much why aint
you heard the news he added in ap-
parent astonishment sorry then i
happened to be first on the wire why
i hear your office was broken into last
night and the safe blown the police
or nobody knew nothing about it until
your stenographer miss whats-her-
name opened the place this morning

  for a moment lorimer felt physi-
cally sick as if he had been dealt a blow
in the pit of the stomach five hun-
dred dollars gone one-eighth of his
initial working capital one-quarter of
what remained of that capital after fi-
nancing the enterprise for a month
five hundred at one clip at a time
when every penny counted instinc-
tively he felt the delaney hard gray
eye upon him as if the other were wait-
ing and watching for some tangible sign
proving the magnitude of the catastro-
phe so that he might gloat over it and
examine it at leisure

  lose much asked delaney solici-
tously

  lorimer laughed lighted a cigarette
and looked the other in the eye it
was evident miss walker had said noth-
ing of the amount of their loss and
he blessed her mentally for her circum-
spection for at all events their enemies
need never know how the blow had
crippled them his was the instinct of
the horn fighter to keep from an oppo-
nent the extent of his punishment so

lie grinned and blew smoke saying
the jokes not on me mr delaney
but on them whoever they are there
never was anything in that safe but a
bunch of papers they couldnt raise a
cent 

  delaney looked his astonishment
well thats good news he said at
length you certainly got off mighty
lucky the safe was a bloomer eh
youre a pretty foxy bird mr lori-
mer and he moved on laughing

  five hundred dollars the words
kept hammering in lorimers brain as
he pursued his way to the office he
had  surplus and it meant that some-
how in some way he must raise that
amount to meet current expenses be-
fore the opening day of the season
this was a blow he had not reckoned
on during his elaborate calculations
just as he had been compelled for the
sake of economy to forego all forms
of insurance if he had only taken
miss walkers advice in this instance
too acted on her suggestion as to the
deposit box in the palestine  em-
pire but the thought of burglars in
such a quiet humdrum little town had
seemed absurd how had it become
known that he was in the habit of leav-
ing such an amount at the office it
could hardly be mere coincidence that
the burglars had selected friday the
one night of the week when the safe
wasnt what cracksmen call a bloomer

  lorimer found miss walker and stu-
veysant in the office talking with the
local chief of police a superannuated
harmless old gentleman with a goatlike
beard the chief pointed out how the
safe had been souped pronounced it
the work of yeggmen and ended by
congratulating lorimer on the trifling
extent of the damage

  meanwhile by various telegraphic
signs quite unobserved by the super-
annuated gentleman miss walker and
stuveysant had managed to convey to
lorimer the fact that they hadnt told
the cpcrocdigal



the extent of their loss while he on
his part by the same telegraphic signs
let them know that he fully understood
how matters stood and approved of
their reticence

  well groaned stuveysant when at
length the three of them were alone
this is a fine hefty kick in the solar
plexus it was miss walkers idea to
say that the safe was nothing but a
bloomer-and luckily she had a chance
to put me wise before i gave the show
away

  i thought put in the stenographer
apologetically it was nobodys business
but our own that it was for you and
you only mr lorimer to state the
amount of your loss-if you wanted
to

  you did the right thing nodded
lorimer on my way here i heard
the cheerful news from delaney and
i told him there was nothing in the
safe but papers i may be wrong of
course but it seemed to me he wouldnt
have dropped dead with grief if id
told him wed lost a quarter of our
remaining capital so i wasnt aiming
to give him any satisfaction weve
got to come up smiling no matter how
it hurts and pretend that the joke isnt
on us

  which after all is nothing more
than the truth nodded miss walker
opening her desk and taking out a flat
package of bills encircled with the con-
ventional strip of paper theres the
pay roll mr lorimer

  for the love of mike gasped stu-
veysant while lorimer could do noth-
ing but stare then-then it wasnt
in the safe at all

 certainly not do you think i
would have told a downright lie to
such a worthy old gentleman as the
chief of police asked the stenogra-
pher with a great assumption of vir-
tue i took the pay roll out of the
safe last night when i was replacing
those papers-you may remember my

back was to you mr stuveysant the
idea just occurred to me after the
turning of that door handle

  and it was in your desk all the
time and they never thought to look
there exclaimed stuveysant well
im jiggered the jokes on them all
right-and on me too for that mat-
ter

  same here said lorimer slowly
i neednt try to thank you miss
walker for your quick wit you know
what this means to me especially at
such a time it places me in your debt
more than ever

 the stenographer made the now
stereotyped reply that it was nothing
no more than what she was paid for
doing but from the expression in her
eyes it was evident that lorimers words
were payment enough

  that afternoon lorimer pocketed his
pride and rented a deposit box in the
palestine  empire bank a proceed-
ing which mr jonas wishart attended
to in person and with some secret
amusement happy if we can prove
of service to you after all air lori-
mer he said with customary courtesy
and a sly twinkle in his keen eyes
we always like to oblige old cus-
tomers but dont you think its a
bit like locking the stable door after
the horse has been stolen

  not a bit mr wishart you for-
get the horse hasnt been stolen yet-
and with the help of your excellent in-
stitution i dont intend it to be either
im glad youve discovered the in-
stitutions excellence replied the other
politely its an ill wind that blows
nobody good in this instance your
loss is our gain

  i guess theres more  truth than
poetry in that thought lorimer and
it isnt confined to this instance either
a certain definite suspicion had en-
tered lorimers mind when miss
walker was explaining about the pay
roll and that evening on returning


the popular magazine

from his daily grind at the ball grounds
and finding her alone in the office the
opportunity of voicing it was pre-
sented

  mr stuveysant was saying last
night he began casually that he
didnt like the idea of you working
here late alone this attempted bur-
glary has proved him right have you
ever had cause to be afraid and if
so why didnt you mention it to me
miss walker not of course he
finished apparently as an afterthought
that i can hope to share the same
state of confidence evidently enjoyed by
mr stuveysant but i think you might
have told me merely as employee to
employer

  but there was nothing to tell she
protested apparently quite forgetting
her initial confession of fright to mr
stuveysant the previous evening ive
never been afraid there never was
anything to be afraid of

  lorimer eyed her hard but she re-
turned his scrutiny with innocent com-
posure

  then the turning of that door han-
dle last night was merely an isolated
occurrence he asked

  certainly

  nothing ever happened to make you
think the office might be broken into
of course not mr lorimer

  and you havent been annoyed by
that man clark or any one else
no replied miss walker concen-
trating her attention on her notebook

  hm said lorimer turning to his
desk

  a minute passed in silence and then
he swung round again of course
he said matter of factly the pay roll
wasnt in your desk last night mr
stuveysant said so but i noticed you
didnt if you didnt think the safe was
safe you wouldnt have put the money
in your desk where it could be found
for the mere looking come miss

walker i want the truth where was
it

  the little stenographer had colored
up and was showing some signs of agi-
tation for all her elaborate efforts at
concealment why-why she began
you saw me take it from my desk

mr lorimer-

 i want the truth miss walker
you took it home with you didnt
you 

  there was no avoiding the question
or his eyes y-yes she said meekly
i-i put it here tapping the bosom
of her dress when mr stuveysant
wasnt looking i-i didnt want him
or-or any one to know he would

have thought my caution silly-

  you mean  would said lorimer
grimly and how long have you been
taking home the pay roll miss
walker

  flow long opening big innocent
eyes why i-you know it was last

night-

  yes and i know it was many an-
other night too come wasnt it every
friday for the past month

  y-yes said miss walker in a very
small voice while she nervously rubbed
her diminutive hands i-i know
youve a perfect right to be awfully
angry mr lorimer i know the action
was very irregular to say the least and
that i-i deceived you but i knew
the money wasnt safe here-i

mean-

  you mean you knew it wasnt safe
here said lorimer inexorably and
that because i laughed at your sugges-
tion of renting a deposit box you pro-
vided one of your own now were
getting down to brass tacks in other
words you were afraid and had reason
to be so though youve tried to make
me believe otherwise and the turning
of that door handle last night wasnt
an isolated incident

  really it was mr lorimer she
protested but once or twice i
the prodigsil



thought i heard some one outside-oh
 cant explain it it was just the idea
that somebody was prowling round try-
ing to peep in the windows then
some nights ive thought i was being
followed home-

 by whom

  i-i dont know i never saw any-
body i put it down to my imagina-
tion which of course it must have
been and i didnt want to say any-
thing to you it seemed so silly any-
how i thought it best to take home the
pay roll every friday night and-and
now im quite ready to be scolded
she folded her hands meekly and
looked at him

  and so you should be-within an
inch of your life declared lorimer
sternly do you realize the risk you
were running if those crooks who-
ever they are had suspected for a mo-
ment you were carrying five hundred
dollars theyd have knocked you on
the head and never thought twice about
it-

  but you see they didnt she in-
terrupted humbly

  no but they might have it makes
me feel quite-quite upset to think that
thanks to my stupidity or whatever you
like to call it youve been running such
a risk for the past month i admire
your devotion to duty and of course
i cant thank you enough miss walker
but all the same you arent paid to ac-
cept such responsibility and risk-

 must one always be paid she
asked slowly looking down and trac-
ing imaginary circles on her notebook
maynt one be allowed to do some-
thing for-for-i mean hastily you
know im not just an ordinary em-
ployee mr lorimer for that matter
miss sands and i mr stuveysant and
mr magee-all of us have the interest
and welfare of the club very much at
heart unlike miss sands i havent
any money to offer as an investment

  b

so i allow myself the privilege of look-
ing after what we have got

  youve a quaint way of putting
things laughed lorimer you know
i think it was awfully nice of miss
sands to make that offer and i cant
forget it i feel that it wasnt with
any idea of investing it but solely a
way of offering me the loan of two
thousand though why she should do
so to a virtual stranger as i then was
is quite beyond me are you sure miss
walker you didnt put the idea into
her head ask her to do it

  i  said the stenographer in evi-
dent surprise what an absurd ques-
tion  why should i 

  well grinned lorimer it seems
to me youd stop at nothing to help
along the business and you told her
it was a good investment you know
and i still think so at all events
mr lorimer it was very honorable
of you to refuse the money so long as
you had any doubts concerning the qual-
ity of the investment im sure it was
a sore- temptation for we needed all
the capital we could get-and still need
it by the way i know your refusal
made a very favorable impression on
miss sands

  simply because i exhibited the com-
mon garden variety of honesty he
laughed she must have had an idea
i was a precious sort of rascal
well you must remember she had
nothing but report to go by-and re-
port wasnt very flattering however
i think youve proved an agreeable sur-
prise to her in many ways oh she
says many nice things about you really
and truly mr lorimer to open an
old subject if you and she would only
find it mutually agreeable to fulfill the
most distressing clause in your uncles
will it wouldnt prove so very distress-
ing for us-i mean the business it
would solve all our financial difficulties
have you ever thought of that mr
lorimer


the popular magazine

  often he replied laconically but
im not quite prepared to sacrifice every-
thing on the altar of the business

  but what would you be sacrificing
miss sands for one thing he
laughed

  per-perhaps it wouldnt be a sac-
rifice after all murmured miss
walker still tracing imaginary circles
on the notebook you couldnt marry
her you know unless she wanted you
to let us agree if only for the sake
of argument that barkis-or rather
peggotty in this instance-is willin
what other sacrifice would there be
principle do you think it a very
fine thing miss walker for one to
marry merely to help his business
but if one loved she protested in-
genuously

  you seem awfully anxious to get
me married exclaimed lorimer quite
peevishly even for the sake of argu-
ment miss sands wouldnt have me
if i was the last man  earth so let
us stop talking nonsense

  i was only thinking of the business
said the little stenographer meekly it
certainly would be fine for the busi-
ness mr lorimer and how do you
know miss sands wouldnt have you
if you havent asked her

  he slammed down his desk and get-
ting up paced the room theres one
thing in all this miss walker he said
grimly at length which you and my
uncle and mr owen seem never to
have taken into account for instance
has it ever occurred to you that i might
be married already

  miss walker suddenly leaned over
her typewriter and began to turn the
ribbon as if conscious of some vital
defect which demanded instant atten-
tion she had lost color and her ex-
ertions negligible as they were seemed
to cause distressed breathing why
she said at length with a gay little
laugh i admit that the possibility never

occurred to me somehow you dont
look and act like a married man

  im not said lorimer

  oh said miss walker the color
as quickly flooding her face she bit
her vivid lip and her eyes snapped
resentfully were you trying to be
funny mr lorimer i dont think
marriage is a subject to joke about
it isnt he agreed soberly ive
been married you see

  oh said miss walker again but
now with quite n different inflection
her face had softened wonderfully
your wife-died

  no said lorimer quite simply i
wish she had

  oh said miss walker for the third
time

  he was pacing the room with quick
nervous steps and he began to talk as
if for the mere sake of talking we
were married less than three months
she never loved me of course but i
thought she did-which amounts to the
same thing i was the sort of ass that
measures anothers love by his own it
was quite enough for me that i was in
love

  at that time i was doing rather well
in business but my position took me
away from new york several months
in the year well when i returned
from my trip that spring succeeding
our marriage it was to find my wife
gone she very thoughtfully left a let-
ter explaining that there was a gentle-
man in pittsburgh-much my superior
in every way-for whom she had al-
ways cared far more than for me she
added that it would be a mere waste

of time and money to follow them-

he paused looking at miss walker
with grave apologetic eyes i really
dont know why i should be telling you
all this

  perhaps because im interested mr
lorimer said miss walker simply i
like to listen-if you dont mind
well anyhow thats the end of the
the pkovigal



harrowing story he added with a
short laugh you see its by no means
new or original in fact quite an every-
day sort of yarn the most harrow-
ing part you might say was the way
it showed up the glaring deficiencies in
my character for instead of playing the
man i played the fool instead of fol-
lowing my wifes sound advice and

wasting neither time nor money-

  and what happened to the man in
the case

  the man oh what usually hap-
pens-he got off scot-free i suppose
hes walking the earth safe and sound
to this day i never knew anything
about him except his name which was
carstairs  never met him you know
im glad now i didnt otherwise a sen-
sational murder trial would have fig-
ured among my unlovely escapades for
i most certainly would have done my
best to kill him in those days and even
now-well i wouldnt care to meet him
old wounds are easy to reopen
then-then you cant forget the
former mrs lorimer

  if you mean do i still love her-no
replied lorimer slowly i cant pre-
tend to the interesting role of martyr-
at least ive somehow outgrown it of
late for two years i did everything
i tried everything from the heights of
religion to the depths of dissipation to
make me forget but i couldnt i saw
her face heard her voice wherever i
went she was with me sleeping or
waking at that time if anybody had
suggested that some day i could calmly
discuss like this the whole wretched
matter that i could hear her name men-
tioned with indifference i would have
been outraged yet its a fact that dur-
ing the last month ive been able to
look back on the whole affair almost
with indifference it would seem that
just as soon as i stopped trying to for-
get forgetfulness came of itself
time can work wonders said the
girl slowly

  or perhaps ive been so busy ive
no longer had time to cultivate my
wounds added lorimer you were
right hard works not only the best
cure for boredom but a good many
other things at least ive found it
so

  its a wonder to me remarked miss
walker at length that you dont hate
all women thats the worst of such
an experience if it happens when one
is young i dont wonder marriage is
a painful subject with you and that
you wouldnt want to try it again under
any circumstances

 oh it isnt that he said awkwardly
but-but i sometimes feel ive had
my chance and bungled it and that ive

no right to another-

  what an absurd idea it wasnt

you who failed-

  oh yes i did in a sense i failed
to make my wife happy-and perhaps
thats the biggest failure of all im
able to look back on this thing with
some philosophy charity and insight
i can see now the girl simply married
me because her parents urged on her
the advantages of my wealth and social
position-not that they were anything
to speak of except in comparison with
her folks she loved this fellow car-
stairs all the time and if i hadnt been
selfishly wrapped up in my own grande
passion i would have seen it

  why did she ever tell you she cared
for somebody else

  no of course not but i should
have guessed it

  how may i ask i think youve
a quixotic way of looking at things
the girl certainly didnt have to marry
you no matter what her parents urged
but having done so she should have
been true to her salt she deceived and
betrayed you shamefully and i can find
no excuse for her there isnt any
excuse for that sort of thing and you
know it

  yes he replied slowly i know it


the popular magazine

at the same time i feel that things
might have turned out all right if car-
stairs had only let her alone and i
place the greater blame on him it
was he who came to new york and
looked her up after id left i heard
all that from the neighbors- of course
i feel we might have made a success
o-f our marriage if wed been given a
chance the lord knows if id ever
suspected she cared for somebody else
id never have asked her to marry me
at any rate i dont feel bitter or venge-
ful against her any more and i only
hope she has managed to find the hap-
piness she couldnt find with me we
were divorced of course and the whole
thing kept quiet

  and did she marry mr carstairs
i suppose so i havent heard any-
thing about them from that day to this
-and i dont want to either

chapter xiii

an understanding between friends

  another week had passed and as
sammy brown predicted the new trac-
tion bill had failed to pass the council
for the strong subterranean props
which had supported it being with-
drawn the enterprising measure col-
lapsed automatically in other words
it was shelved until a more fitting occa-
sion the city fathers being suddenly
convinced that palestine would bebet-
ter able to meet the expenditure in say
the fall further translated lorimer
saw that this meant an extension of
the rope by which it was confidently
hoped he would successfully hang him-
self by fall he imagined it was ex-
pected in certain quarters that not only
would he be a corpse together with his
defunct club but resting metaphori-
cally in some cemetery remote from
palestine	

  the week had seen no progress to-
ward the detection of those responsible

for the abortive burglary though it was
true the chief of police wagged his
goats beard and whispered significantly
that he was still conducting a vigorous
investigation his and the general
opinion seemed to be that it was the
work of yeggmen who had long since
left town by a side-door pullman as
they had entered it another explana-
tion had naturally occurred to lorimer
stuveysant and miss walker that per-
haps the bunch knew why friday
night had been selected for the at-
tempt

  delaney and the rest may have put
somebody up to it said stuveysant
we mustnt forget that every dollar
we lose is their gain

  lorimer nodded still id hate to
think that delaney or any of them
would stoop to a thing like that it
may have been yeggmen you cant tell

  well well give delaney the benefit
of the doubt and meanwhile keep our
powder dry grinned stuveysant hold-
ing up a revolver about a foot long
heres a young cannon that hence-
forth reposes in your desk miss
walker well put it there because thats
where they wont expect one mind
its loaded i believe you said once
you werent afraid of such things

  im not said miss walker picking
up the heavy revolver and expertly
swinging out the cylinder my father
taught me how to handle firearms but
this is entirely unnecessary mr stu-
veysant  one would think we were ex-
pecting to be raided by indians

  stick it in your desk all the same
urged stuveysant isnt that right
harry

  sure laughed lorimer id have
brought my own but unfortunately it
fell into a new york ash barrel

  of conyers lorimer had seen little
since the interview in the others rooms
for conyers now made his home in al-
bany where it was said delaney em-
the ptrovlgal



ployed him in his gambling house this
seemed to bear out lorimers suspicion
that delaney and conyers had reached
an understanding from the first and
that the former was wholly insincere
in claiming he believed the other had
possessed full authority for closing the
deal now and then conyers paid a
visit to palestine but either he kept
out of lorimers way intentionally or
their paths did not happen to cross
at all events they only saw each other
occasionally and at a distance

  his other enemy-mr clark-lori-
mer had not been permitted to forget
for the ex-manager had tried to cause
trouble he had tried by various meth-
ods to influence the members of the
ball team even presenting himself at
lorimer park during their practice
here he struck an unexpected snag
in the person of magee who could use
his hands much better than his tongue
and clark retired from the brief inter-
view with a badly discolored eye and
several minor casualties this brief in-
terview convinced clark that any hope
of fomenting trouble or breeding inter-
necine strife in the invincibles was fore-
doomed to failure that magee was a
dog that knew how to guard his flock
and one whose bite was to be feared

  and a most promising flock it was
that magee had rounded up and was
daily hammering into shape the
money at his command had been spent
judiciously and whereas the salaries
still averaged about the same as under
the old regime the distribution was
vastly different for instance fifty dol-
lars a week was being paid for one
slab artist with a corresponding reduc-
tion in a less vital part of the machine

  magee had stiffened up the infield
got a brace of hitting outfielders and
a young backstop from the bushes who
looked like a comer in fact there was
a winning team in process of forma-
tion at lorimer park a team that
should not only finish well up in the

first division but perhaps walk off with
the rag

  be it remembered there was nothing
remarkable in all this rather indeed
would it have been remarkable if fail-
ure had waited on all the efforts ex-
pended for it may be safely said that
no team in the county league had ever
worked harder more intelligently or as
long in preparation for the opening
game of the season

  the invincibles were not only work-
ing in the hope of evolving a winning
team for the mere financial gain which
that would mean but they were bring-
ing to the fight something their oppo-
nents lacked-a pride in the old club
and the determination to rid themselves
of the incubus the humiliation which
had been theirs for the past four years
they meant to wipe out the stigma of
the cellar champions

  in lorimer they had found one whom
daily they were learning to look upon
as they had looked upon the old man
in his palmiest days while in bud
magee they had a field manager far
and away the best in the county
league

  though lorimer knew in his heart
that the success for which they had all
worked so hard and earnestly was loom-
ing in sight still as it drew on to the
opening of the season he was assailed
by numerous doubts and fears the
tension was beginning to tell and there
were moments when his confidence
dropped to zero his heart turned to
water and he wondered if the team
was really half as good as magee and
he fondly imagined had they hypno-
tized themselves into thinking it a
world beater and were they after all
only a bunch of sand-lotters the open-
ing game would prove the crucial test
for it was to be played at lorimer park
with the maroons last years cham-
pions and a team that had always fig-
ured in the race if the invincibles
could even make a fight of it hold


the cpocpulacr magazine

them to a fairly even score he would
be more than satisfied this though he
hoped in his secret heart the maroons
would go down to defeat in one of the
biggest surprises of their life this
though magee predicted that with a
fairly even break in the luck the in-
vincibles could figure on at least a tie
game

  were goin to catch that bunch fast
asleep and hand it to em before they
wake up said magee confidently
theyre goin to find that a lemon can
taste mighty sour if you bite into it
hard enough why not one of em be-
lieves weve got anythin but the usual
bunch of swill and that were only
throwin a tall bluff ive been all down
the line an i seen nothin we need be
so leery of they think ive been
takin your money and have kidded you
along-and i aint been sayin diffrent
see theyve still got you down for a
rummy that dont know nothin about
the game or what hes up against these
wise guys have got to be shown

  there remained however the dis-
turbing truth that the wise guys had
to put in an appearance in order to
be shown the finest team in the world
is useless without patronage lorimer
had done his best but if palestines
hostility went to the length of refusing
to support even a winning team then
he would have failed as completely as
if the invincibles were still the sand-
lotters he had found them

  such were some of the doubts and
fears which harassed him as it drew
on toward the opening of the season

  these days saw also a slight coolness
and restraint develop between phyllis
sands and miss walker perhaps due
on one side to mr stuveysant on a
certain occasion being flagrantly late
for his appointment with the plans of
the dandy flower bed perhaps due on
the other side to miss sands over-
sight in not stating on another certain

  occasion that her invitation to tea em-
braced guests other than miss walker

  a similar coolness had sprung up be-
tween lorimer and stuveysant or
rather lorimers grouchiness first
displayed toward his friend on the night
of the abortive burglary had now be-
come chronic at first stuveysant pre-
tended to be oblivious to it to ignore it
he knew the tension under which the
other was working the unremitting la-
bor he had put in the responsibilities he
was shouldering and he attributed this
new reticence this sudden aversion to
the old familiar chats they formerly en-
joyed this new desire to keep to him-
self-all this he attributed to a very nat-
ural reaction and attendant depression
due to overwork miss walker had said
lorimer wasnt feeling well and his ac-
tions certainly showed it it was not
long however before he discovered that
this explanation however plausible was
a failure for lorimer seemed his old
optimistic cheerful self with magee
miss sands or miss walker-in fact
with any and every person but him
horace stuveysant this discovery dis-
tressed him and not being given to
mental subtleties or dissembling he soon
sought an explanation from the other

  say he blurted out one night when
they were alone in their room whats
eating you anyway

  lorimer paused in his mean econ-
omies-he was pressing his trousers
again-long enough to look surprised
what do you mean

  you know very well retorted stu-
veysant warming up to the subject
somethings wrong somewhere along
the line you dont act natural youve
got something against me and ive seen
it for the past week look here he
finished anxiously is it my work

havent i made good-

youve made good right through
declared lorimer hastily youve been
practically invaluable and you know it
im more than satisfied you and ma-
the vkodigal



gee and miss walker-well you arent
paid for all you do not by a jugful

   this was not flattery for stuveysant
had filled his protean position capably
nor was he simply the office boy which
he liked to call himself he had worked
hard and faithfully representing lori-
mer efficiently in matters which the
other was unable to attend to in person
through lack of time or more pressing
affairs thanks to lorimers tutelage
and his own endeavors he was develop-
ing into a capable business man and
had sloughed all his former inertia with
some of his superfluous flesh for it
was a fact that horace stuveysant had
actually lost weight and moreover was
doing so daily thanks to unwonted un-
remitting activity physical and mental
coupled with the boarding-house menu
getting fat on ten dollars a week is
well-nigh impossible

  well then what is it pursued
stuveysant if ive done anything or
failed to do something let me hear
about it talk right off your chest i
care too darn much for our friendship
to have it spoiled this way

  lorimer put down the iron and eyed
his friend shamefacedly youre
right he said coloring hotly ive
been acting like a cad and i apologize
youre one of the best and-hang it
all im glad its you seeing it-it cant
be me congratulations heres luck
old scout and all the joy in the world
his eyes had cleared and he smiled as
he offered the other his hand

  well for the love of mike said
stuyvesant pumping lorimers hand up
and down in a dazed mechanical fash-
ion very kind of you im sure but
whats it all about

  you know blamed well you old
hypocrite said lorimer making a suc-
cessful attempt to still speak cheerfully

   stuveysants innocence was bland and
unassuming search me cross my
heart he declared fervently the
only time ive been congratulated and

   addressed with such veneration is when
somebody wanted to borrow money
what have i done now

  made some misguided girl fall in
love with you you fat romeo

  oh well said the other inflating
his ample chest and complacently eying
the flowing lines of his figure after
all can you blame em  but let me tell
you juliets got to have a ladder-
preferably made by krupp-if she ex-
pects me to do any second-story work
im not built for balcony scenes he
laughed and thumped the other on the
back you cant kid me you old
fake

  its straight goods said lorimer
soberly i thought you knew of
course

  mr stuveysant after a searching
glance grew quite pale and agitated
honest harry say-say is it-can
it be miss-miss sands

  miss sands good lord no i
only wish it was

  so do i breathed stuveysant sink-
ing into a chair nobody else mat-
ters he made feeble signs of dis-
tress youve given me an awful turn
harry my boy pray reach me my
smelling salts i feel quite weak after
this sudden rise and collapse of all my
hopes

  stop your nonsense this is seri-
ous said lorimer staring heavily at
his friend do you mean its miss
sands you care for 

  the other was now serious enough
of course you know how it was with
me from the first who else could it
be i know now i was only trying to
deceive myself when i said it must be
the air up here that made me want to
go to work and quit being a condemned
fool i know now it was miss sands
all the time-nothing she said mind but
just the way she affected me all through

i	felt it the first day i spoke to her of
course you arent able to understand
harry-


the pocpulacr magazine-

  oh am i not asked lorimer
grimly perhaps ive been affected the
same way

  stuveysant lost color rubbed his
chin and looked away yes he said
-slowly of course miss sands was
your uncles ward and then theres that
clause in his will so youve sort of got
the inside track but i was sort of
banking on what you said-what you
both said-about never marrying-
though that wouldnt figure at all if you

iearned to care for each other-

  enough of this despairing solilo-
quy broke in lorimer miss sands
and i will never be more than good
friends i dont care for her the other
way-and lucky for me i dont for
shed never care for me the other way
either

  i dont know about that said stu-
veysant shaking his head but its a
great load off my mind to learn you
havent aspirations in that quarter you
were the one i was afraid of-and im
afraid of you yet

  you neednt be to be frank with
you i care a whole lot for miss walker
and-

  i thought as much when did you
find it out 

  the night i found out that she cared
for you thats why i went home sick
thats why ive treated you so shabbily
for the past week now you know the
truth

  but miss walker doesnt care for
me said stuveysant were good
friends and nothing more

  perhaps-where youre concerned
replied lorimer gloomily anyway
weve cleared up the atmosphere and
you know how we stand it isnt your
fault if miss walker cares for you

a lot-

  nor yours if miss sands cares for
you

  if we only could get them twisted
round right

  yes sighed mr stuveysant but

miss sands has sort of turned me down
of late and it will take a powerful lot
of missionary work to put me in right
again

chapter xiv

success

  the great day had arrived at last-
the day which lorimer longed for and
dreaded at one and the same time a
few hours more and he would know if
he had labored in vain evolving a win-
ning team a paying proposition or reg-
istered a gigantic failure which would
leave him a beggar head over heels in
debt it was only a county-league team
yet it may be safely said that  owner
or manager of a big-league club looked
forward to the opening game of a
worlds series with more anxiety or
nervous expectation and perhaps no
worlds series could mean more than this
opening game meant to lorimer

  the champion maroons came down
for the annual slaughter confident and
easy-going for their games with the in-
vincibles always partook of the nature
of a festival-for them at least they
never condescended to put their full
strength in the field but welcomed the
palestine club as a trial horse upon
which they could experiment with raw
material indeed the poor old cellar
champions were regarded throughout
the league almost with affection a good
soft pillow on which to recline and re-
cuperate after the rough-and-tumble
with hardy rivals

  well remarked mr burney the
maroons tight-faced manager looking
round lorimer park and addressing its
owner in his patronizing way youve
certainly made a good job here why
this would do for a champion team
yes thats what i meant it for
said lorimer simply

 burney laughed do you think
youve got one 

  why ill tell you that at the end of
the season
the pcrcdgal



  mr burney laughed again ill tell
you one thing he vouchsafed out of
his great experience it will take a win-
ning team to fill them stands you must
have spent a good bit of money here
pity you aint got a regular team to
back you up he turned and eyed
lorimer keenly wondering for the first
time if the other were the inexperienced
and moneyed young fool report had
said and which magee had never denied

  the invincibles were out on the field
warming up and after watching them
critically for some time in silence mr
burney decided to switch his battery
he had intended originally to pitch a
new recmit who was in need of a good
trying-out but now he passed the word
for a reliable old port-sider who though
no rube marquard had always taken
the invincibles scalps with cheerful
regularity of course thought burney
the game would prove the usual walk-
over but all the same baseball was
full of surprises even in lowly county
leagues and it didnt pay to take un-
necessary chances there might be
truth in the occasional glowing reports
he had heard concerning the revamped
invincibles at all events the new re-
cruit might just as well wait until the
massacre was an assured fact then he
could go in and read the funeral ora-
tion

  meanwhile the stands were filling
slowly and there was every prospect of
a big attendance the maroons were
always a good drawing card bringing
their own rooters by the hundred while
palestines curiosity and love for the
game had triumphed over any hostility
lorimer had feared it might entertain
for him

  perhaps not one believed the invin-
cibles were in for anything but the usual
stereotyped assassination but they were
anxious to see for themselves just what
lorimer had accomplished if anything
also it was an excuse for a holiday and
at the beginning of the season one must

see some kind of a ball game however
rotten so they came in their hundreds
billy and betty reuben and cynthia
john henry and mary jane came by
motor trolley and farm wagon not to
mention old reliable shanks mare came
for twenty miles round having set aside
the day and marked it in the calendar

  and almost among the last came billy
wate presenting himself at the window
where stuveysant was selling tickets

  handed myself a holiday and blew
up for the big show greeted wate
wouldnt miss it for a farm hows
the gate

  blooming exclaimed stuveysant
in high glee while he eyed lovingly the
harvest of quarters and halves fol-
low us and youll wear diamonds my
boy i havent seen so much money
all at once in a dogs age its a darn
good thing for lorimer that i was bom
honest and incorruptible pass on o
deadhead youre blocking the line and
preventing these good people from
spending their hard-earned cash

  deadhead yourself grinned wate
heres a brand-new half ive been
keeping in the tin bank at home been
saving up for a year gimme the best
seat on the field

  nothing doing we scorn to take
your money thats the kind of people
we are lorimers given the word to
pass all his friends-

  not much said wate its my
inalienable right to contribute to this
auspicious occasion and id like to see
anybody take it away from me and
mind no holding out and putting my
savings in your pants ive my own
private opinion of your incorruptibil-
ity

  so stuveysant shamelessly tried a
good set of teeth on the new half dol-
lar expressed openly his opinion that
it was counterfeit and ended by giving
the other admission to a box adding
youve paid for the privilege of sit-
ting with miss sands and miss walker


the pocpular magazine

supplying them with peanuts and ex-
plaining the essential difference between
the umpire and the shortstop together
with all the other fine points of the
game and see that you behave your-
self for im chief bouncer of this show
there goes heinie i-iozenmullers band
the pride of palestine theyre starting
the parade on the field so youd better
beat it see you later

  so billy wate entered to the enliven-
ing strains of see the conquering
hero comes a delicate tribute which
meant for the maroons he took to him-
self and acknowledged fittingly by re-
moving his hat and bowing condescend-
ingly right and left thereby causing a
great deal of unnecessary emotion and
conjecture to this day there are reu-
bens who believe it was john mcgraw
or connie mack scouting in person for
likely material

  there is no need to relate the great
game in detail for a certain scribe
named sammy brown has done so most
worthily a fact which one may prove
for himself by consulting the back files
of the palestine journal suffice that
palestine history was made that day
and sammy having unlimited space
spread himself in a manner denied the
present recorder

  magee had predicted that they would
catch the maroons fast asleep-a pre-
diction that was amply fulfilled mr
burney did not awaken thoroughly until
the despised cellar champions in their
first session at the bat fell on the old
reliable southpaw and whaled him out
of the box

  mr burney was having almost a pri-
vate hemorrhage he had been caught
asleep at the switch and he knew it
moreover he had no one to blame but
himself the vicious stickwork of the
invincibles in itself was a ghastly reve-
lation and they seemed to be playing
not for money but blood

  fundamentally mr burney was a
cautious gentleman for all his pom-

posity and confidence and he always
made it a point to travel well heeled
thus he was now able to replace the
exploded port-sider with a first-string
man and this slab artist soon stopped
the harrowing batting rally-for a time
but the damage was done the invin-
cibles closing the session with the com-
fortable margin of five runs plus it
was a slaughter but hardly the kind
confidently expected by the maroons

  the rest of the game was a hammer-
and-tongs dingdong affair the ma-
roons now had their full strength in
the field and were putting up the best
brand of ball of which they were ca-
pable one of the runs against them
they had managed to get back but the
other four remained where they were it
was too big a handicap even for a cham-
pion team for they were playing a club
to which they could afford to give away
little or nothing that the invincibles
had come back with a vengeance after
four long weary years in the cellar and
were there to stay was a fact which
became increasingly clear as the game
wore on it was no flash in the pan
and even this peter delaney at last
grudgingly admitted

  well he remarked to wishart and
jepson expert fans like himself
theres no use talkin hes turned the
trick all right and blamed if i thought
he would believe me thats some ball
team out there

  it is nodded the president of the
palestine  empire all young blood
too you might say i doubt if silas
lorimer had ever the makings of a
better if they can hold their present
form those boys should make a good
bid for the championship

  its all due to this fellow magee
put in jepson looking more than usually
religious and subdued hes a wonder
from all accounts far too good for this
league all the credit is his not lori-
mers

  i dont know about that said de-
the prodigal



laney slowly while he chewed reflec-
tively on his cigar i guess next to
being able to do a thing yourself is the
ability to pick the right man to do it
for you lorimer has the knack of
makin others work for him and gettin
the best out of em ive noticed that
he dont seem to drive em either
ive observed that too nodded
wishart that team didnt grow in a
night and weve got to give him credit
for hard and intelligent work let me
say that in the capacity of a private
citizen of palestine and a ball fan ive
enjoyed every minute of this game and
the handsome trimming handed to the
maroons its been coming to them for
a long time

  as a ball fan i echo the sentiment
said jepson dryly but a winning team
for palestine wont put any money in
our pockets

  no added delaney it wont a
daily attendance like this here would
soon put our friend on easy street and
he could afford to hang onto lorimer
park till the cows come home but one
game dont make a winnin team by a
long shot and they got the jump on the
maroons in this one also its a long way
to the end of the season and a lot can
happen before that lorimers bank
rolls eaten up and hes got to meet ex-
penses out of the gate and these stands
have got to be paid for by the first
of next month well see what well
see time enough to think of offerin
him a price for lorimer park when we
cant help it

  so the memorable game ended with
the final score of seven to three in favor
of the invincibles and mr burney ac-
cepted the amazing defeat with at least
outward philosophy and fortitude he
was still smiling when he congratulated
lorimer but there was a wicked gleam
in his pale eyes

  well youve certainly called the
turn and put one over on us he fin-
ished but let me tell you the same

gag dont go twice well be waiting
for you next time my boy and youll
get yours all right

  maybe replied lorimer well
take a lot of beating mr burney
youve got to show us that we havent
a winning team thats what were
here for

chapter xv

the price of success

  it was in the middle of june and the
invincibles were running second in the
league the maroons leading by an in-
significant percentage for as mr
burney had predicted his club making
heroic efforts had taken the next game
and drawn the third it was too early
in the season to make safe predictions
yet it seemed the fight for first place
must rest solely between the maroons
and invincibles no dark horse had as
yet loomed up no other club had ap-
proached the form of these two

  in other words the invincibles were
an assured success and had turned out
better than lorimer or magee had dared
hope they were a younger team than
the champions and it was said in cer-
tain expert quarters that the latter
would go stale and cave in under the
grueling contest while the invincibles
drawing on their youth seemed to speed
up and get better with every game

  lorimers heart was not set on win-
ning the pennant for that was some-
thing which had entered but remotely
into his calculations he had striven to
turn out a team that would finish well
up in the first division be a credit to
palestine rather than a disgrace and
as a natural consequence become a pay-
ing proposition all this he had vir-
tually accomplished and if incidentally
the invincibles happened to walk off
with the pennant so much the better
if not his heart would not be broken
the main thing being that the team was
making money instead of losing it and


the popular magazine

that there was every promise of a big
return on his investment if the attend-
ance averaged for the season anything
approaching the past fortnight the first
of september should see him clear of
debt and with a handsome balance to
meet the succeeding season he had
touched the high-water mark of success
and the future stretched before him
rosy and golden

  that section of palestine-the se-
verely respectable church-going ele-
ment-which had known and honored
silas q lorimer yet which had circum-
spectly held aloof from the nephew
fearful of the rumors that preceded
him now discovered him to be a very
estimable and hard-working young man
whom report had basely calumniated
severely respectable houses were sud-
denly opened to him and invitations
flowed in while he was given the op-
portunity of meeting the marriageable
progeny of severely respectable ma-
trons even delaney wishart and jep-
son seemed anxious to cultivate his
neglected acquaintance and bury the
hatchet-if such an article had existed
for indeed lorimer began to wonder
if he had misjudged this triumvirate
being led astray by sammy browns ani-
mosity and his own fears which might
have bred unworthy suspicion and ex-
cess caution in short harry lorimer
suddenly found himself popular due
perhaps to the simple reason that un-
qualified success is always popular he
was pointed out as the individual who
had revived palestines baseball glory
and spoken of as the young napoleon
of the game while others more mate-
rial said he should be a rich man before
he was thirty

  these were happy days things
seemed to be going right at last and
all doubt and misgiving-those dark
hours of despondency and ceaseless
self-examination and anxiety-were
buried in the past he even seemed to
be making some headway with miss

walker thanks perhaps to the under-
standing he had reached with stuvey-
sant

  lorimer it may be seen was not
without intellect but man generally ap-
pears at his stupidest in matters of the
heart if a womans yes or no means all
the world to him at times lorimer
could think of many things miss walker
had done and said-things which
pointed to an interest which could not
be born of mere friendship on the
other hand at all times he could think
of just as many which pointed to the
contrary nor could he rid himself of
the fear that her real interest was for
horace stuveysant that the latter
seemingly did not reciprocate that he
was once more in the good graces of
phyllis sands failed to help matters in
the least

  on the whole however notwithstand-
ing this suspense and doubt the sudden
raising of his hopes one day only to
have them dashed the next the lying
awake at night ceaselessly revolving the
situation and experiencing all the con-
ventional pangs of the lover who is
afraid to put fortune to the test-in
spite of all this these golden days of
june were happy ones even mr clark
had ceased from troubling and was
rarely if ever seen if any under-
standing existed between peter delaney
and him it must have terminated sud-
denly for mr clark was looking very
seedy and far from thriving either he
had made no effort to secure employ-
ment or had been unable to find it he
could always be located in the lowest sa-
loons frequented by the toughest citi-
zens and he was absorbing more strong
waters than was good for him or any-
body else a fact borne out by the fre-
quent drunken brawls in which he fig-
ured and his spending several days in
the town jail together with several boon
companions indeed it seemed as if
mr clarks prediction concerning pan-
handling had come home to roost and
the cprcdigal



that he was developing quickly into that
type of citizen who is given so many
hours notice to remove himself to an-
other county where he may be less un-
favorably known

  nor had matters prospered with
mortimer conyers lorimer heard it
from stuveysant who had picked it up
via delaney from a town gossip

  i hear conyers has been fired
said stuveysant delaney and he fell
out last week

  what was the trouble asked lori-
mer

  cant say rightly but you know con-
yers beastly temper i heard though
that delaney accuses him of holding out
on the bank-he was in charge of one
of the tables i suppose i dont like
to believe it

  nor i said lorimer ive no use
for him but all the same i dont think
hed stoop to that

  well said stuveysant philosophi-
cally when you come right down to it
what he did to you-and there must
have been many others-was just steal-
ing under another name theres no
virtue in this touting game evidently
delaney gave him a straight job-if you
can find anything straight in a gam-
bling joint-and he even ditched him
in the end i dont know where hes
gone or whats become of him no
doubt hell bob up all serene and try
to touch you for a loan he must
have heard of your success

  lorimer shook his head i dont think
liell come near me no matter how hard
up he is conyers and i had one heart-
to-heart talk during which he was itch-
ing to open my head with the poker
i dont want anything to do with him
but all the same im good for a touch
any time he wants to make it

  you always were a forgiving dis-
ciple grunted the other of course
im sorry for him in a way but all
the same the only kind of touch he de-

serves from you is a good healthy swat
in the slats

  lorimer laughed oh well i can
afford to forgive my worst enemies
these days theres nothing like suc-
cess to fill one full of the milk of hu-
man kindness im just running over
with it

  it was on a friday morning the sec-
ond week of the season that miss
walker asked for her first holiday
which was readily granted the in-
vincibles were to play out of town-
against a team which had preempted
the others old place in the cellar-and
this easy series had served to relax the
general tension

  miss walker stated that she had to
go to albany to do some shopping

  why said lorimer with well-con-
cealed delight ill be going there my-
self later in the day this hiking to
albany ever- friday for the pay roll
is a nuisance and theres no sense in it
so im going to retransfer the account
to the palestine  empire i neednt
have withdrawn it in the first instance
you know i think ive been all wrong
about delaney wishart and jepson
anyhow the account will be just as safe
in palestine and it will do away with the
risk such as it is of carting the pay
roll from albany

  but you neednt go to albany to
transfer the account said miss
walker why not transfer it by
check 

  why it would take too long he
replied and i need the pay roll for
to-morrow anyway he omitted to
add that he had only decided on the
trip after learning of her intention

  well said miss walker of course
youll take a draft for the balance you
wont take it in cash

  he laughed oh theres not so much
over the pay roll-about fifteen hun-
dred all told-

  which is all weve got in the world
you talk as if fifteen hundred was a


the cpocpular magazine

mere bagatelle do you feel so rich as
all that

  lorimer laughed again he was feel-
ing very happy and successful oh
well ill take a draft for the balance
he said just to humor what he some-
times jestingly called her sense of ex-
cess caution but really theres no risk
ive been carting home the pay roll for
a month remember the fellows that
blew this safe skipped the county long
ago and it was only a chance incident
anyway im convinced of that

i suppose it was she replied slowly
but all the same youll get the draft 
oh yes certainly and by the
way can you meet me at the ten eyck
for lunch

  she looked embarrassed im sorry
but i wont have time ive so much
to do

  lorimer concealed his acute disap-
pointment that part of his plan had
miscarried well then how about
coming home together might as well
you know seeing well both be there
can you meet me at the station in time
for the three-thirty i can get into the
bank here any time after five and
often wishart stays till seven

  miss walker hesitated it would be
much better-i would really prefer it-
if you didnt wait for me mr lorimer

im not at all certain-

  oh come now he urged that
will give you plenty of time for shop-
ping

  well-well she stammered ill-
ill try but if im not there for the
three-thirty please dont wait will you
promise that

  oh certainly he laughed but i
know you will be there

  so miss walker left on an early-
morning train and lorimer followed a
few hours later locking up the office
for the day as stuveysant had gone
with magee and the invincibles

  lorimer dressed with more than or-
dinary care for he meant that this day

should see the end of his doubts and
fears he meant on the way home
while he had the uninterrupted opportu-
nity of being alone with miss walker
to propose marriage it may be as-
sumed that this momentous undertaking
 less than the confidence inspired by
success had a certain bearing on his
subsequent actions and that he was
thinking rather more of how miss
walker would receive his question than
of the money he had undertaken to
transfer

  on reaching the bank lorimer for-
got his promise concerning the draft
or rather being in a hurry grudged
even the small time necessary for that
detail at all events thought he there
was no risk he had carried the pay roll
half a dozen times without incident for
that matter so far as risk was con-
cerned there was little difference be-
tween five and fifteen hundred so he
closed his account took it in bills
stuffed them into his wallet and rushed
off to the station there he had plenty
of time to cool his impatience miss
walker failed to appear for the three-
thirty

  lorimer waited patiently in more or
less trepidation at the coming interview
but four and four-thirty passed and still
no miss walker his temper was now
rising to blood heat in all likelihood
the palestine bank would be closed on
his return but he had ceased to think
of that or care he had made up his
mind to propose and propose he would
if he had to wait for her all night so
wait he did grimly and stubbornly until
five oclock struck and still there was no
miss walker doubt began to assail
him had he missed her it was not
impossible though the station was
small and he had scrutinized every fe-
male that bore the slightest resemblance
to her

  five-thirty and no miss walker
lorimers mood suddenly changed and
swearing inwardly he boarded the last
the ptrovlgll



car as the train pulled out he was a
fool to have waited for her even a
minute she had never meant to keep
the appointment he remembered her
diffidence and embarrassment when he
first made the suggestion she could
not be spending all that time in shop-
ping it was impossible even for a
woman if she had not meant to keep
the appointment why had she not said
so lie certainly did not wish to force
himself on anybody

  from these thoughts it may be seen
that lorimers temper had for the mo-
ment triumphed over his sense of jus-
tice and that he conveniently ignored
the-fact that he had promised not to
wait if miss walker found herself un-
able to keep the appointment he was
thoroughly upset at this wrecking of his
plans he was gloomy depressed and
his hopes had sunk to zero what
chance had he got when she did not
even care enough about keeping an ap-
pointment obviously none

  and so when he left the train at pal-
estine and crossed the little park at rail-
road square lorimer was still thinking
rather more of miss walker than of the
hard-earned cash in his pocket it was
dark among the trees yet off to the
north there stood a dull-red glow in
the sky like the aftermath of an angry
sunset yet the sun has never been
known to set in the north

  he was puzzling apathetically over
this phenomenon when a stealthy move-
ment at his back caused him to turn in
time to receive a blow that sent him to
his knees

  he staggered to his feet to find him-
self surrounded by three men one of
whom despite the darkness he had no
difficulty in recognizing as the erstwhile
manager of the invincibles

  so its you clark he called out
and with the words instantly rushed
the other

  evidently mr clark was taken aback
by this sudden onslaught evident also

that he was surprised and none too well
pleased at his identity being known he
had counted on the first blow from
ambush stretching lorimer unconscious
ignorant of what had hit him but that
blow had not fallen as calculated and
he had reckoned without his victims
fighting spirit

  they fought silently viciously as ani-
mals fight rolling over and over thrash-
ing through the undergrowth using
fists teeth and nails and lorimer
was gaining the upper hand when the
other two men who meanwhile had been
dancing about impotently looking for
an opening seized upon him tore him
from clarks prostrate form and with
several hurricane blows stretched him
apparently lifeless

  lorimer was conscious however
as one is conscious in a dream deli-
rium during which he can move neither
hand nor foot that brutal hasty fin-
gers were searching his pockets con-
scious while unable to voice a protest
that his wallet representing virtually
all his earthly possessions had been
pounced upon

  then after bestowing on lorimer
several contemptuous kicks the trio
stole oft and left him lying among the
trees

chapter xvi

the final blow

  how long he lay there in the little
and at that hour unfrequented park
lorimer did not know he had lost all
sense of time what seemed hours was
in reality minutes for youth and a good
constitution soon asserted themselves
and though he had been knocked about
badly there were no bones broken

  dazed and weak he staggered to his
feet while all about him was a great
noise of people shouting and the clang-
ing of bells which he had thought part
of his dream delirium the lurid glow
in the northern sky was leaping and


the popular magazine

throbbing while the night air carried
the taint of smoke an engine and ten-
der of the volunteer department went
clattering by throwing a trail of sparks
and as lorimer emerged from the park
he blundered into the flying sammy
brown

  wheres the lire asked lorimer

  ball grounds whole thing gone
up panted brown and rushed on
without realizing to whom he had been
speaking

  lorimer plunged after him hardly
knowing what he was doing main
street was choked with people stream-
ing north the trolleys swamped to
the footboards were running by fits and
starts one could almost make as good
time on foot so lorimer continued me-
chanically in the wake of the surging
crowd this second and greater blow
made him forget the recent assault and
robbery the loss of every available cent
he owned

  when at length he reached lorimer
park it was to find his worst fears
realized the whole place was simply
a roaring caldron of flame everything
had gone up which fire could burn
not only the grand stand bleachers and
clubhouse but the fence surrounding
the grounds there had been no rain
for two weeks and the june sun had
baked the new wood to the consistency
of tinder there was nothing that hu-
man agency could do in the way of salv-
age nothing to do but let it burn itself
out while keeping the flying sparks from
starting another conflagration luckily
for palestine a town of wooden dwell-
ings and boasting only a volunteer fire
department there was no building of
consequence within half a mile of the
ball grounds

  lorimer seeing that absolutely noth-
ing could be done stood apart from the
crowd which for the most part with the
thoughtlessness of all multitudes could
only see in this palestines biggest fire
not a tragedy for one individual but a

magnificent pyrotechnic display a wel-
come break in the monotony of daily ex-
istence excitement something to talk
about for weeks to come something
from which to date local events

  lorimer wished no expressions of
sympathy he was hit too hard for that
and so he stood apart and sought to hide
himself as might a leper from the cu-
rious he watched with hard unwink-
ing eyes as the crater of flame swal-
lowed up the stands which must be paid
for in two weeks and on which there
was not one dollar of insurance nor one
penny in the bank with which to meet
the debt or for that matter the mor-
rows pay roll his total reserve thanks
to his stupidity and overconfidence had
vanished in one sweep as completely as
everything which once stood within
lorimer park

  he turned wearily and trudged back
to palestine alone with his thoughts
he was down but not out one
thought alone possessed him-to fight
on somehow in some way he must
find the means of building anew how
this was to be accomplished he did not
know but he must find a way or make
one he must begin all over again he
must call on any reserve of character
he possessed rally all his forces to meet
this overwhelming double disaster he
must not let it down him so he set
his teeth and gave defiance to fate

  it was in this spirit that he entered
his boarding house greeting the land-
ladys perfunctory expressions of sym-
pathy with thanks and a cheerful laugh
he wanted to be alone to think later
he must talk it all over with stuveysant
and miss walker on the latter at
least he could rely for some helpful
and stimulating suggestion for she had
proved equal to every emergency and he
had come to rely on her perhaps more
than he realized even as yet

  there was a letter lying on the table
and he picked it up mechanically recog-
nizing to his surprise stuveysants
the prdgal



sprawling hand he opened it and be-
gan to read it was dated that morning
from albany and ran as follows

  dear harry you know im not much of
an ink slinger but ill try to break the news
gently so here goes-when this reaches you
miss walker and i will be married

  i was lying when i told you i cared for
miss sands for it was miss walker all the
time but i was afraid you were taken the
same way and i wanted to find out just what
if anything was between you and what
chance i had im sorry old man but you
know that a woman can come between the
best of friends and that in such cases every
man has to fight for his own hand

  i know that youll come to look at this in
the proper spirit it isnt as if she ever cared
for you or could care for you and after all
im only taking whats my own i ask you
to remember this and not to think harshly
of us

  you know the governors been thinking
pretty well of me since he found i was actu-
ally working so well end the honeymoon in
new york and be taken back into the fold
now that youve made such a howling suc-
cess i feel easier about leaving in this abrupt
fashion which after all we think is best i
know i can be easily replaced

  i havent forgotten your many kindnesses
and i hope i may always subscribe myself
your old pal	horace stuveysant

  lorimer read the letter through a sec-
ond time as if to make sure that his
eyes were not deceiving him then he
folded it and placed it in his pocket

  he sat down passive immobile and
stared at nothing in particular so the
third last and greatest blow of all had
fallen  for after this nothing mattered
and he could jeer at fate daring it to
do its worst

  meanwhile the invincibles had re-
turned to find their home a heap
of glowing ruins and magee after a
futile hunt for lorimer about the town
ended at the others boarding house
here amid all the excitement he found
lorimer sitting calmly pulling at an
empty pipe as if nothing had happened
so stolid and apathetic vas he that ma-
gee was forced to believe he knew noth-
ing of what by this time almost the

 b

whole county was discussing but lori-
mer soon undeceived him

  well exclaimed magee grimly i
admire your nerve you certainly take
it mighty easy have you heard any
talk of it bein a fixed job

  no i wasnt talking with any one
well i have the fire was started
in half a dozen places and oil used
pop stryker left about six to do some
buying in the town and the fire bug
must have watched his chance it was
a carefully planned job all right they
took the day we was playing out of
town and when you was in albany
lorimer made no comment and the
other eyed him sharply say whats
the matter with you he asked anx-
iously

  here lorimer happened to shift his
position so that the lamplight fell full
upon his face and magee exclaimed
say youre all bunged up was you
hurt in the fire

  lorimer shook his head he spoke
apathetically i was held up in the
park by clark and two other men and

robbed of every cent-

  what yelled magee springing
from his chair

  yes its a fact the bank was shut
when i got here i loafed away the

time in albany- no i havent been

drinking magee i was perfectly sober
i only wish i had been drinking theres
some excuse for a fellow making a
cursed fool of himself you see i
should have taken the balance in a draft
i neednt have lost more than the pay

roll- and i should have returned

here before dark before the bank shut
its all my own fault oh yes its all
my own fault-everything

  and did clark make his get-away 
demanded magee

  oh yes i put up the best fight i
knew how but they were too much for
me it happened about a couple of
hours ago i guess i dont know how


the cpocpulacr magazine

long i lay in the park i wasnt expect-
ing anything of the kind

  now aint you done nothin aint
you even told th cops

  lorimer shook his head wearily i
meant to of course but the tire put it
out of my head anyway its too late
and they wont be able to do anything
they never can

  the other stared at him and then
looked away these are a couple of
awful wallops one of em would have
been a plenty an just when we was
cornin along so fine it smells to me
like a rotten fixed job all through they
must have known you was bringin the
coin from albany and they must have
laid for you it cant have been no acci-
dent ill lay a bet delaney and his
bunch had a hand in it we was coinin
along too fine to suit em burnin you
out and takin your bank roll at the same

time- he swore and walked up

and down the room

  lorimer shrugged yes it was a
fixed job i suppose but if delaney had
a hand in it-and im not saying he
had-well never be able to prove it
wont we asked magee through
his teeth well see he could have
got that guy clark to turn both tricks
but we should be doin something in-
stead of chewin the sock what are
you goin to do

  do why nothing

  nothing shouted the other
amazed are you goin to lay down
an take this not if i know you you
aint

  what can i do

  fight said magee viciously
fight their bloody heads off well
muddle through somehow you cant
mean youre goin to cave in and sell
out after puttin up the fight we done
look here replied lorimer pa-
tiently and in the same tired voice you
dont seem to realize how we stand
im cleaned out i havent a cent
theres a pay roll due to-morrow and

in two weeks i have to pay a couple
of thousand on the stands i havent
the money to rent another field-even
if i could find one suitable-while were
fixing up the old one and i havent

the credit to fix up the old one-

  stop right there interrupted ma-
gee aint you got a winnin team
back of you aint that worth some-
thin this town aint the only one on
the map and wishart an his bunch
aint the only guys with money youve
got a payin proposition and though i
aint no wall street shark ill bet you
can get the loan of all the coin you
want all you got to do is scout round
for it anybodys ready to back a pay-
in proposition-

  at a price interrupted lorimer
these arguments of magees had been
precisely his own not so long ago he
had told himself all this and believed it
but now everything was changed and
the words seemed futile empty blatant
at a price he repeated grimly the
price that capital always demands
theyll grab control and ill be work-
ing for a dead horse no i bit off
more than i could chew thats about the
size of it i hadnt enough capital to
swing the thing i hadnt enough to
pay even for insurance and when i had
i tried to save money the wrong way by
letting the insurance slide i took a
chance and lost out

  aw you aint talkin natural pro-
tested magee distressed whats hap-
pened to your nerve you aint lost
out at all you made a big success and
you know it youve run up against a
cold deck an a rotten deal which aint
your fault thats somethin that can
happen to anybody look here kid he
continued earnestly adopting uncon-
sciously the familiar affectionate title
of the sporting world you dont want
to let this down you dont you worry
none about the pay roll the boys are
awful strong for you an theyll wait
for their money there aint one of
the prdgal



em but what will get up behind you an
see this thing out to the finish its you
who put em where they are to-day an
they know it why kid he continued
eagerly well breeze through with bells
on for weve got a winnin team an

theyll stick-

  its no use magee lorimer looked
at the other with tired eyes and an air
of utter weariness its good of you
and the boys i know youll stick and
make all the sacrifices necessary and
believe me i appreciate it but its no
use i know i could raise the money
somehow if i set out to do it i know
i could get out of this hole deep as it
is if i had the will power but i
havent magee i havent it in me ive
made my fight the best i was capable
of and i havent another in me im
-im ashamed to confess it but its so
im through i want to get away from
palestine and-and forget there was
ever such a place he turned away
abruptly with clenched hands and
twitching lips

  aw say expostulated magee
pausing and scratching the cannon-ball
head at loss for words say i guess
that bealin up you got has knocked you
off your base all right he added
brightening up as this explanation oc-
curred to him we wont say nothin
more about this kid for you aint nat-
ural and you cant see it right youll
feel different in the morniri what you
want to do is to take a hot bath an a
good rubdown an then hit the hay an
forget it i know you aint a quitter
you leave this to me for to-night ill
scout round an see about rentin a field
or findin some kind of a place th
fans will turn out to see the team play
even if it was on a dump heap an dont
you forget it th boys are right behind
you kid so dont you do no worryin
youll feel all right in th mornin see
if you dont youll be there with all
th old pep

  and so because lorimer felt the fu-

tility of further argument because he
could not bring himself to explain his
true ailment-that of the spirit and not
the body-because he felt too tired to
talk he made no effort to correct the
others erroneous belief and magee
after these crude but none the less sin-
cere expressions of sympathy took his
leave

  alone lorimer smiled grimly at the
idea of his feeling better in the morn-
ing though there was no doubt that
the vicious assault in the park coupled
with reaction from the days excitement
was taking its toll of his mental and
physical stamina but the real wound
the only one that really counted went
immeasurably deeper and it was neither
temporary nor superficial he saw
clearly that miss yvalker had been the
focus of all his endeavors and that with
her out of the picture forever he lacked
the heart and will to tackle anew the
uphill fight he must learn to forget
before he was of any use to himself or
the world it was all right to talk of
courage and the never-say-die spirit but
to-night he was absolutely barren of
both he doubted if he would ever
know them again

  it was here while he sat brooding
that temptation born of his wounds and
desperation came upon harry lorimer
why not marry phyllis sands the
question leaped into his numbed brain
unheralded unasked after all why
not indeed  love was an elusive quan-
tity he need no longer look for nor ex-
pect in marriage he had sought for
it in vain marriage with phyllis sands
would solve all his financial difficulties
and it would be some consolation to
show delaney and  his crowd-even
though he did not believe them respon-
sible for the robbery or fire-that he
would win out after all what could
he not do with one hundred and fifty
thousand-his half of the inheritance
it would be a sop to his wounded pride
to show miss walker-or rather mrs


the popular magazine

horace stuveysant-and her husband
that their hasty and secret marriage
meant less than nothing to him temp-
tation urged many specious arguments
he would be doing what his uncle
wished phyllis sands was an admi-
rable and lovely girl in all respects a
girl any man would be proud to call
his wife it was not improbable that
she cared for him enough at all events
to promise success if he threw his heart
and soul into her conquest and pro-
fessed a passion he could never feel for
her for love begets love it was here
that lorimer revolted no the whole
thing was utterly impossible and aside
from any question of fair play toward
phyllis sands whose friendship he es-
teemed he could not act a lie and he
would not sell himself whatever the
price or his necessity it was impos-
sible and so he put aside the question
forever

  the entrance of the landlady at this
moment obviated further thought
theres a man downstairs mr lori-
mer who wants to see you

  visions of tedious newspaper inter-
views expressions of sympathy from
local gossips whose real object was to
worm out inside information they could
hawk about the town suggested them-
selves inevitably to lorimer and he
grew irritable i dont want to see any
one no matter who it is you know that
tell him im-im taking a bath say
ive gone to bed or new york-any-
thing

  its no use mr lorimer really
it aint i says you didnt want to see
anybody but he insists he says hes a
detective and that he wont keep you
moren a minute i couldnt get rid of
him

  remembering what magee had said
about the talk of it being the work of
an incendiary lorimer believed this
visit connected with the fire at lorimer
park all right he said wearily

show him up i suppose hes a local
man 

  im sure i dont know replied the
landlady i never seen him before

chapter xvii

discoveries

  the visitor proved to be a large un-
buttoned gentleman and the manipula-
tion of a frayed toothpick seemed neces-
sary to the accomplishment of his by
no means agile mental processes for
during the entire interview the said ar-
ticle never left his stubby fingers he
intimated that his name was steincamp
and that he belonged to albany head-
quarters while it soon became evident
that he had no interest whatever in the
recent fire at lorimer park

  indeed mr steincamp appeared in-
terested solely in photography for
after a perfunctory greeting he pro-
duced the reproduction of a cabinet
photo and handed it to lorimer with the
laconic query know him

  lorimer looked and hesitated the
picture was that of a dark handsome
man with a vandyke beard and the
eyes if nothing else seemed familiar

  i dont know he replied puzzled
i feel i should know him

  mcbbe thisll help you out said mr
steincamp in his offhand way shoving
another picture under lorimers nose

  it was a picture of mortimer con-
yers conyers minus the beard conyers
as he had always known him

  them chin creepers make a world o
difference remarked mr steincamp
with professional admiration never
seen such a difference in anybody i can
remember friend of yours aint her
he was his name is conyers
his alias you mean his right name
is carstairs did you know him in
pittsburgh 

  carstairs pittsburgh

  perhaps well get  much faster
mr steincamp if youll state your busi-
the frdigal



ness said lorimer his voice a trifle
unsteady

  sure nodded the other well
the pittsburgh police want carstairs
theyve wanted him for over a year
they found that after going west hed
come to new york and was living un-
der the name of conyers the shaving of
his chin creepers making him mighty-
hard to identify last month they lo-
cated him in albany and asked us to
put the nippers on him but it was too
late for hed left town ive been look-
ing for him ever since hearing of him
here and losing him there you see
hes wearing the chin creepers again
and that makes it hard because folks
that ought to know him dont they
aint looking for whiskers see

  mr steincamp paused long enough
to transfer the toothpick to the other
side of his wide mouth

  well he continued to-day id
pretty good reason to believe our friend
was heading up the line so i comes
over i seen the chief here and he tells
me he aint heard nothing but that if
any one should know anything about
carstairs its yourself for that you and
him was pals in new york that
right 

  lorimer nodded i met conyers in
new york-i didnt know his right
name was carstairs-a little over a year
ago i never knew he was wanted by
the police

  yes commented mr steincamp
never removing his stolid gaze from the
other his deductions were slow but
as a rule accurate

  conyers-or carstairs-and i quar-
reled about two months ago added
lorimer and i havent seen him since
what is he wanted for

  oh a small enough business-grand
larceny theres an assault against him
on the books too hes one of these
fellows that keep shaving the law till
some day when they aint careful they
stack up against it and bust wide open

he run off with another mans wife
from new york too-all that kind of
stuff ive got his rccord here slap-
ping his pocket youre sure you aint
seen him round  couldnt gimme a line
where to find him eh 

  i could not i havent heard any-
thing about him you see- lori-
mer paused then added calmly you
see i happen to be the man whose wife
carstairs went off with ive just found
that out from you so im not trying
to shield him

  mr steincamp failed to look sur-
prised nothing ever surprised him

  that so he merely remarked
never knew he was the fellow eh 
no he was a chance acquaintance
thats all id never seen him before
and of course thought his name was
conyers all that youve told me is
news is-is he married 

  no i understand there was a
woman though let me see her name

was nina-nina-

  farrington

  thats it nodded the detective
he traveled with her until she threw
him over she was a bad egg too
lorimer turned away

  well ill be dodging along an-
nounced mr steincamp methodically
wiping the toothpick and placing it be-
hind his ear if you happen to hear
anything about our friend just pass it
on hes around here somewheres and
i guess ill have the nippers on him
before long he aint going to travel
much farther

  he accepted a cigar nodded in his
offhand style and said good night

  howj small the world was after all
reflected lorimer conyers was car-
stairs and he had never known had
carstairs known from the beginning
the name lorimer must have sug-
gested inevitably something to him
what a jest of fate for them to meet in
such a manner and he had treated
carstairs like a brother and nina


the popular magazine

farrington so the divorce had not
benefited her and she had resumed her
maiden name a bad egg too was
how the detective had callously de-
scribed her it was impossible to think
of her fate without emotion even
though her name no longer had power
to stir anything but his compassion he
had sought to find excuses for her he
had sought to defend her before miss
walker but after all was said and done
-well it seemed she had not even
proved loyal to carstairs had the en-
tire fault been carstairs as he lori-
mer always believed strange he
should hear of these two now at the
moment when his own life lay for the
second time in ruins what a mess all
three of them had made of their lives

  somewhere a clock struck and lori-
mer roused himself with an effort it
seemed ages since he was parading up
and down the albany station waiting
for the present mrs horace stuvey-
sant ages since the fight in the park
and the fire yet the night was young
and he had work to do he must go
down to the office and wind up his
shattered affairs lorimer park must be
sold at public auction or taken over by
the mortgagees and his small surviving
interest would be enough to meet the
morrows pay roll and a few minor
debts the contracting firm that built
the stands and otherwise improved the
ball grounds must wait for their bal-
ance yes there was work to do work
he would much rather shirk

  he took a devious way to the office
in order to avoid publicity but never-
theless near such an out-of-the-way
neighborhood as the freight depot came
face to face with none other than mr
peter delaney and for the moment
mr delaneys famous facial disturb-
ance failed to work

  why hello lorimer he exclaimed
at length sort of startled me you
did what are you doing down here

  on my way to the office said lori-

mer apathetically i dont want to be
stopped and sympathized with every
few yards

  mr delaney wagged his head and
looked solemn its tough mighty
hard luck when you were coming along
so well he spoke with some sym-
pathy but there was not a spark of that
commodity in his hard gray eye
them stands will cost something to
replace you hadnt even settled for
em had you

  no said lorimer he laughed
suddenly mirthlessly i guess im
through with the baseball proposition
youre wise said delaney there
aint the money in it people think and
you cant do anythin without capital
i guess youve seen that accidents
like this fire to-night are always crop-
piri up and youve got to be ready for
em otherwise you dont figure no-
where

  lorimer said nothing

  look here added  delaney if
youre goin to sell ill give you a better
price for your interest than youll get
at a sale or from the mortgagees he
had become quite genial there
shouldnt be any hard feelings between
you and me lorimer i guess mebbe
you thought my deal with conyers was
a frame-up well it wasnt and i give
you my word for it i acted in per-
fectly good faith and i didnt find out
till later the sort of crook he was

  still lorimer said nothing

  so pursued delaney briskly ill
make you a fairer offer than youll get
anywhere else if you dont feel like
talkin business now suppose i come
round an see you in the morning
all right replied lorimer absently
of course ill need all the money i
can get and it may as well be from you
mr delaney as any one else

  he stood for perhaps a minute star-
ing after the delaney figure as with a
genial word of farewell the other wad-
dled off into the night his was not a
the cfxrocdigal



suspicious nature yet at the first there
had been something strange about the
delaney manner his excuse about be-
ing startled seemed lame for by no
means was he a person easily startled
by unexpectedly meeting any one in the
dark and what had brought him down
at that hour to the now closed and de-
serted freight depot yet not deserted
for he heard the slow clanging of a bell
and presently a slow-moving string of
flats cut dimly across his vision

  to reach the office by this round-
about route lorimer must cross the
railroad and now he waited patiently
his thoughts still on delaney evidently
the passing train was a fast freight-he
knew there was one due at that hour-
and had stopped for water at the pal-
estine tanks for it was gathering mo-
mentum every second and soon the
red tail light of the caboose whisked
into view vanishing in a cloud of cin-
dery dust

  he started across when suddenly
there came the sound of flying feet and
up the tracks from the direction of the
water tanks came a shadowy figure at
top speed here an arc light near the
freight depot shed its violet rays so that
lorimer could see the runner and in
turn be seen

  as he paused wondering what had
happened a voice boomed out from the
runners back

  hey nail that guy

  it was magees foghorn voice and
lorimer waiting for nothing further
started forward  the jump the man
tried to dodge but was brought crash-
ing to the rails by a flying tackle that
knocked the last ounce of breath from
him

  good enough kid panted magee
hopping up out of the darkness and
recognizing lorimer that was some-
thin like thought you was home in
bed and here you are with all the old
pep lets have a slant at our friend

   clark exclaimed lorimer turning

the face of the but half-conscious pris-
oner to the light

  sure nodded magee expectorating
freely and using his sleeve to wipe away
the blood from a cut over one of his
countersunk eyes spotted him just
as he was hoppin that side-door pull-
man his pals walloped me an got
away thanks to my game leg this
bird would have too if you hadnt hap-
pened to be right where you was i
guess lucks breakin our way kid

  but how did you find him how
did you happen to be down here

  why i happened here on purpose
replied mr magee as if it were the
most natural thing in the world how
does a guy like that always pull foot
after a dirty job why bya side-door
pullman of course the only way he
could hop th town was by freight he
knew youd recognized him and that
hed have to make a long jump of
course there was the chance that hed
gone already but i figgered on him
waitin for the fast through freight i
knew when she was due and that they
always water here so did he and his
pals you bet then there was a fourth
guy who left em just before the freight
pulled in i couldnt see him plain but
say he walked like pete delaney-you
know like a duck in a thunderstorm

  it was delaney said lorimer im
sure of it and he told of meeting the
other

  magee cackled hoarsely and so well
pleased was he that almost uncon-
sciously he fetched mr clark a re-
sounding kick in that convenient part
of the anatomy where the boot is usually
applied

  get up you heap of misery he or-
dered peremptorily and mr clark stag-
gered to dazed unwilling feet then
magee taking him by the collar ran
him across the tracks and stood him up
against the wall of the freight station
where he was exposed to the pitiless
glare of the arc light


the pocpulacr magazine

  say go easy will you wailed mr
clark at this rough handling me
wings broke honest it doubled up
under me when i was throwed and
he looked accusingly at lorimer

  mebbe it aint the only thing about
you that will be broke before im done
with you said magee unsympatheti-
cally come across with the coin you
swiped-every case note

  lorimer stood by saying nothing for
it was quite evident mr magee was ca-
pable of handling the situation himself
evident also that biff clark tough
gentleman though he was entertained
a lively respect for the other

  i aint got it not a cent of it he
protested earnestly we didnt make
a split and one of the other two fellows
has it thats straight go through me
and see

  you bet i will said magee darkly
and proceeded to search the other from
head to foot but mr clarks person
yielded no spoils then magee holding
him by the collar raised a menacing fist

  you didnt cache it eh talk
straight now the hamlike fist com-
pleted the threat and clark wilted vis-
ibly breaking forth into a storm of
whining protestations

  i believe hes speaking the truth
put in lorimer

  magee nodded whats the names
of these two friends of yours what
do they look like no lying now  mr
lorimer will know if youre talking
straight for he seen them in the park
when he seen you

  this was taking liberties with the
truth but assisted by the threat of
that menacing fist the bluff worked
clark replying with evident sincerity if
unwillingness

  i know them as simpson and
okeefe he said sullenly i dont
know if those are their right names
theyre a couple of bums i met in dia-
mond jerrys saloon simpson is the
one with the swag then he gave a

fairly illuminative description of the
gentleman in question

  and where was you booked pur-
sued magee inexorably new york

  yes but of course since they know
theyve been spotted theyll leave some-
where along the line

  the best we can do put in lorimer
is wire albany and new york now
look here clark im not after the small
fry i want the man higher up i want
the name of the man back of you in this
thing

  the other did his best to look aston-
ished there wasnt none you seen
the three of us-simpson okeefe
and-

  theres no use lying clark there
was more back of it than mere highway
robbery mr magee saw delaney with
you here to-night and i saw him my-
self-

  i dont know what youre talking
about said clark sullenly there
wasnt any other but us three

  leave this to me kid spoke up
magee grimly addressing lorimer
just take a walk down the platform
for this thing aint in your line when
you return youll find our friend willin
to talk all over himself im one of the
best can openers you ever seen leave
it to me

  at this the sweat broke out on the
ex-manager and he glanced fearfully at
magees bulldog face

  well im-im willing to tell all i
know he said jerkily but it aint
much

  thats better nodded magee softly
rubbing his huge hands spit her out
clean it was delaney huh

  yes but dont expect me to prove it
i only know that this fellow simpson
was the leader and that he comes from
albany it was simpson that delaney
met to-night near the freight depot and
okeefe and i wasnt allowed to hear
what passed simpson was boss and he
told us to keep down by the water
the vcrovigal



tanks i only seen delaney a long ways
off but i knew him by his walk-though
i wont take my oath to itin court i
didnt know for sure until you said hed
been here

  you knew there was some one back
of simpson the leader but didnt know
it was delaney this from lorimer

  thats right replied clark with ap-
parent sincerity of course i thought
of delaney for i knew how he wanted
lorimer park but he didnt trust me
i guess or thought it better to have an
outsider like simpson pull off this game
mebbe simpson and okeefe are old
henchmen of his or he has a hold over
em i dont know the rights of it for
they didnt tell me nothing

  anyway i was hard up i had it in
for you and when simpson sounded
me about the job i fell for it he said
there was big money for all of us and
 risk that he knew a fellow with a
pull who would see everything went
smooth and who could get us out of any
trouble simpson knew all about you
going to albany for the pay roll and 
guess mebbe he could tell you something
about the first robbery when the safe
turned out to be a bloomer id no hand
in that for i didnt know simpson then
and understand i dont know positive
lie did it its only a guess

  well he concluded the rest you
know simpson was to make the split
in new york and if you land him
youll get the money and the rights of
the whole business-if hell talk

  lorimer nodded magee pll see the
chief and attend to the wiring of al-
bany and new york then i have to
go to the office for a while for the
present i intend to say nothing of
clarks part in this business-not even
to the police i want it kept a strict
secret i want you to take him by a
roundabout way to your home and keep
him there let no one see him pll be
with you later

  i get you said magee briefly hey

you shake a leg and a muscular
arm entwined securely around that of
the cowed and dispirted prisoner a
massive hand twisted unobtrusively in
the others cuff he marched off whis-
tling

  lorimer had an interview with the
chief of police mentioning nothing con-
cerning the ex-manager of the invin-
cibles and then went to the office
where to his surprise he found the
door slightly open

  he entered quietly the place was
in darkness yet not so dark as to hide
a kneeling figure before the safe which
had replaced the one put out of com-
mission during the abortive burglary
the kneeling figure was that of a man
who sprang to his feet on lorimers
almost silent entrance something
gleamed in his hand

  lorimer laughed with unaffected
amusement

  my friend he said youre just a
little bit late for my own sake i hope
youll find some money in that safe
dont mind me go to it and may for-
tune reward you perhaps youll do
better with some light

  he switched on the wall electric near
which he happened to be standing and
confronted mortimer conyers-or to
give him his right name carstairs car-
stairs plus the chin creepers mr stein-
camp had so admiringly described
carstairs plus a revolver

chapter xviii

how a certain gentleman arrived
too late

  they stared heavily at each other for
a long moment carstairs beard was
no longer the trim vandyke of the
photo but ragged and unkempt his
clothes were shabby his eyes bloodshot
his face and hands stained black with
grime all the potential and brutal
qualities of the man- had now gained
physical expression and he looked at
the popular magazine

lorimer as he had looked when grasp-
ing the poker during their last mem-
orable interview

  he raised the revolver you start
a racket and ill- the accompany-
ing gesture completed the threat

  lorimers thoughts if not his eyes
strayed momentarily to miss walkers
desk he wondered if stuveysants
young cannon were still there very
likely not he had no idea of attempt-
ing to defend his property-for there
was virtually none to defend-but in-
stinct told him he was facing a greater
danger for carstairs seemed capable of
anything his actions were evidently
prompted by an abiding hatred the
cause of which he lorimer had begun
to perceive dimly at another time the
situation would have proved much more
stimulating than it now was for he had
come through so much in a few short
hours that his nerves failed to respond
to this new shock he was genuinely
unaffected almost bored what did
even life itself matter when he had lost
all that made life vorth the living

  so he sat down and smiled as car-
stairs went over and locked the door
it was late the shades were down and
it seemed highly improbable that any
one would appear to interrupt them

  well began carstairs with his old
sneering smile i wasnt exactly ex-
pecting you mr lorimer but now that
youre here its just as well itll save
me the trouble of cracking that safe
theres nothing in it its not worth
opening

  the other smiled no and yet
this is friday isnt it it sticks in my
mind you always brought the pay roll
on friday jump he finished with a
sudden change of tone open it
lorimer shrugged oh very well
nothing like being shown i suppose
he arose negligently set the combi-
nation and swung back the door help
yourself he yawned

  carstairs weapon in hand kept a

wary eye on him while he conducted
the search but this was needless for
lorimer had returned to his seat where
he sat passively a look of utter indif-
ference in his tired eyes

  youre only wasting time- he said
with a faint smile youve been beaten
to it long ago i was held up and
robbed to-night of not only the pay roll
but every cent i owned i suppose you
wont believe me but it doesnt matter
whether you do or dont

  the other stared there was that in
lorimers face in his words and man-
ner which compelled belief slowly he
closed the safe door and approached a
savage joy in his somber eyes

  so some one got back at you eh
he said well im glad i dont mind
losing the money so long as youve lost
it

  lorimer made no reply and the other
added that was a mighty nice little
fire you had up at the ball grounds he
leaned forward sneering would you
like to know who to thank for it 
lorimer looked at him with mild in-
terest

  im not much of a detective he
said but from your appearance and
the faint smell of smoke off you and
gasoline also from the general good
will you seem to bear me i should say
you knew something about it

  i know a whole lot about it replied
carstairs i set it and lit it-thats
how much i know you can thank no
one but me he leaned back as if to
contemplate the effect of his words

  there was none lorimer showed
neither emotion nor interest

  do you hear pursued carstairs
raising his voice it was i who burned
you out and now it seems youve lost
your last cent too that is better than
i expected for at the most i only hoped
to deprive you of the pay roll i take
off my hat to whoever held you up i
didnt expect such help

  still lorimer said nothing
the cpcrcdigal



  so then we may say that youre
ruined eh pursued carstairs you
were always so confident lorimer so
cocksure of your own great abilities
he lay back and laughed you were -
going to do so much yes you were
going to do so much-and this is the
result burned out and robbed of your
last cent you must pardon me if i
seem rather festive over it it isnt often
in this world that ones dearest hopes
and wishes are realized so fully
lorimer offered no reply and the old
menacing look returned to the others
eyes you take it mighty coolly dont
you he sneered always prided
yourself on your nerve eh well well
see what your nerves worth before im
done with yon youll be interested
enough before the finish my little debt
is by no means settled have you an
idea what it is

  you talk like the tragedian of a
bowery theater said lorimer with a
faint amused smile but you always
were strong on heroics carstairs
carstairs started at mention of the
name his face flushed darkly and the
veins stood out on his thick neck like
whipcord

  oh yes added lorimer you see
i know your right name i know youre
the person whom ive to thank for my
necessary divorce

  i am replied carstairs fiercely
what are you going to do about it
why nothing lorimer lighted his
pipe and looked calmly at the other
the time for doing anything is passed
if id succeeded in locating you say
two years ago i suppose id have done
my best to kill you but ive got over
that the affair has ceased to interest
me

  oh has it and you think it has
ceased to interest met demanded car-
stairs with an oath he put his face
down close to the others its you
who made me what ive become and
now youre getting the benefit of it i

knew nina farrington long before you
ever did i was engaged to her she
was mine before you and your filthy

money stole her away-

  thats nonsense there was no
stealing about it i never knew she
was engaged to you-if she was i

never heard your name mentioned-

  you lie you knew all about it
but you got round her parents you and
your filthy money you didnt care for
any one think of any one but your
beastly self well you married her-
and i got her away from you but
you and your filthy money had mined
her she was no longer the woman i
had known-nor was i the same man
youd given her a taste of luxuries-
luxuries i couldnt supply and to sup-
ply them i had to turn thief yes
thief then she left me and its you
i can thank for it all you ruined her
as you ruined me

  really this is certainly a sur-
prise remarked lorimer with his
faint bitter smile rather than being
the injured party as ive always imag-
ined i suddenly find myself a villain
responsible for the wrecking of two
innocent lives i think no wronged
ex-husband ever found himself in such
a unique situation youre ingenious
carstairs but i wonder youd bother
about mutilating the truth your ha-
tred for me is the hatred of the person
who has injured another who never in-
jured him in reality its not me you
hate but your own abominable actions
carstairs made a fierce menacing ges-
ture what ive said is the truth and
you know it i hated you before i
ever saw you and i had reason if ever
a man had you drove me into all
forms of dishonor do you think our
meeting that night in the hoffman
house bar was accidental not much 
id found out all about you do you
think it was solely for profit that i
introduced you to sontags  i meant to
leave you a drunken beggar in the gut-


the popular magazine

ter-thats what your filthy money
would have done for you-and id have
succeeded if your uncle hadnt died and
left you this property even then i
would have succeeded only for this in-
terfering fool of a stenographer miss
walker but ive succeeded all the
same youve lost your last cent
youre ruined youre a pauper

  lorimer knocked out his pipe yes
im all that he said calmly you
and others have succeeded in every-
thing but making me a drunkard-and
perhaps that may even happen if i live
long enough eying indifferently the
weapon in the others hand i dont
know if what youve said is the truth
if so then you and i have both been
the victims of an unfortunate type of
woman for she never told me she loved
you and i never even knew your name
until she mentioned it in the farewell
letter she left whether or not you
believe this is immaterial at all events
the past is past so far as im concerned
and i cant get excited about it any
more for ive no longer anger or in-
terest the faint amused smile re-
turned to his lips as he concluded
among all the other things you say
ive made you become i dont want to
add that of murderer

  carstairs looked at the weapon he
held as if for the first time in doubt
what use to make of it from potential
tragedy the situation was threatening
to develop into farce what can one
do if the prospective victim refuses to
be frightened or even interested over
his threatened demise to shoot a man
down in cold blood is not so easy as
it reads besides everything lorimer
had said bore the indelible stamp of
truth

  you see continued lorimer a
smile of iron in his tired eyes the fact
of the matter is carstairs that its not
in your power to hurt me youve
come too late for your revenge noth-
ing you could devise could be half as

bad as whats happened to me already
frankly i havent the interest to care
what you do theres a loaded re-
volver in this desk he added pointing
to the article near which he was seated
and i could have managed to get it
out long ago if id thought it worth
while now if youve decided to shoot
fire away if not youll excuse me for
ive work to do and by the way
whatever you decide to do id do it in
a hurry if i were you for theres a
detective in town looking for you oh
yes there is it was from him i learned
your right name and several other
things his name is steincamp and
youll know him by the toothpick he
wears i suppose as a law-abiding citi-
zen its very reprehensible of me to tip
you off-and i really dont know why
ive done it perhaps because to-night
i havent even the ambition to have any
hard feelings but its a straight tip
and i advise you to go while the goings
good he leaned back folded his
arms and looked placidly at the other

  carstairs hesitated a long moment
staring fixedly at lorimer then slipped
the revolver into his pocket and strode
to the door he turned and gave a
short laugh i guess youre right he
said slowly youre not worth shoot-
ing

  he opened the door and turned again
for a final look at lorimer who had not
moved but still sat passively the same
air of utter indifference stamped in
every line of his slack figure ill tell
you one thing said carstairs grimly
your nerve has saved your life to-
night he closed the door and stepped
into the vestibule

  instantly lorimer heard an oath and
the sound of a ferce scuffle followed by
a pistol shot the sound galvanized him
to action and kicking over his chair
he tore open the door and ran out on
the sidewalk there his suspicions were
verified for mr steincamp the blood
running down his stolid face from a bul-
the prodigal



let which had furrowed his scalp but
with the toothpick triumphantly in its
place behind his ear was grappling with
carstairs and even as lorimer ap-
peared the burly detective snapped the
nippers on the others wrists been
laying for you young feller he said
matter of factly now come along
quietly or ill beat your head off

  late as it was an excited crowd had
gathered and the last lorimer saw of
carstairs he was being piloted through
it by the capable and by no means gen-
tle hand of mr steincamp then lor-
imer turned to reenter the office and
came face to face with the former miss
walker

chapter xix

explanations

she was breathless white-faced

  oh mr lorimer she exclaimed
almost tearfully what has happened

ive just heard about the-the fire-

her words trailed off and she looked
at him piteously at his haggard impas-
sive face and hard hard eyes

  they had entered the office to escape
from the crowd and lorimer now
closed the door mechanically the famil-
iar action lending him some composure
for to suddenly find her whom he be-
lieved far away close at hand was a
shock that momentarily unnerved him
this meeting was something for which
he had not bargained and it brought
home his loss with redoubled force
against his will and despite his fierce
self-contempt his hungry eyes feasted
greedily on her every but too well-re-
membered features-the vivid lips the
amber curls the speaking eyes which
he had thought fatuously held so much
promise for him with an effort he
mastered his emotion steeling himself
to meet those eyes calmly

  why he said with a forced laugh
nothing very much has happened mrs
stuveysant-

  mrs-mrs what she had col-
ored hotly and was eying him amazed

  mrs stuveysant he repeated look-
ing his own astonishment at her sur-
prise

  why-why-how dare you call me
that she exclaimed her lips began
to quiver her eyes to fill i-i think
it a very poor time for joking-and i
think it a very poor sort of joke in

any case-

  but-but you were married to mr
stuveysant this morning you know
you were

  i know nothing of the kind she
cried stamping her foot i think 
should know whether im married or
not are you insane mr lorimer or
-or am i 

  but your marriage-its all here in

the letter-

  what letter

  the letter stuveysant sent me to-
day lorimer with wildly beating
heart fumbled in his pocket his fin-
gers were shaking as if with palsy his
breath choking and he seemed to be
acting like one in a dream the let-
ter he repeated here it is-see
there it is in black and white

  wondering she came close to him
so close that a vagrant strand of hair
brushed his lips every fiber of his be-
ing thrilling to the contact she read
the letter slowly and once or twice the
shadow of a smile flickered in her dark
eyes at length she glanced up the
picture of outraged innocence

  why mr lorimer this must be one
of mr stuveysants jokes you know

his idea of humor-

  do you mean youre not married
cried lorimer hoarsely

  dear me no not to my knowledge
she replied in a very small voice fold-
ing her diminutive hands and eying him
meekly it isnt leap year so-so im
still waiting to be-to be asked

  the words ended in a little gasp for
lorimer had suddenly pounced on her


the popular magazine

picking her up bodily and crushing her
to him as if to hold her against the
world sweetheart was all he could
say and this very brokenly

  be it recorded that rather than mani-
festing the proper degree of conven-
tional maidenly surprise and indignation
at this startling behavior miss walkers
two arms with all the pleasure and
boldness in the world went about lor-
imers neck and she pulled down his
lips to hers she was half crying half
laughing dear is it really true i
thought-i thought i would have to do
the proposing after all

  strangely enough at this point a
hiatus occurred in the dialogue and
when at length miss walker was per-
mitted to use the vivid lips for the very
necessary and useful purpose of articu-
lation the amber curls were in scan-
dalous disorder her cheeks crimson
and her eyes brilliant as twin diamonds

  youre a very small person after
all to cause such fearful havoc de-
clared lorimer and he picked her up
and deposited her carefully on the top
of her own desk

  true theres not much of me re-
plied miss walker humbly but what
there is i can recommend-to you

  of course it was only a variation of
the same old love story which the pa-
tient world has been listening to for
ages yet it was very new and wonder-
ful to them and this most logical in-
evitable happening seemed marvelous
and beyond belief it was positively in-
credible staggering credulity that of the
earths teeming millions they two should
have met and loved

  at length miss walker began to ask
innumerable questions nor would she
agree to answer any of lorimers till
he had told her all about the robbery
the fire and the visit of carstairs and
now he laughed as he recited his
woes how trivial inconsequential they
seemed

  so were ruined he concluded

cheerfully but only for the time be-
ing nothing matters and i feel i
could move mountains so long as ive
got you ill manage to get money
somehow and magee and the boys will
stick his eyes fell on stuveysants
letter and he laughed again now he
could even perceive some humor in it

  well ill get square with that gen-
tleman some day you see if i dont
he exclaimed it was a mighty tragic
joke for me while it lasted i can tell
you i wonder what on earth ever put
it into his head

  why-why dont you see harry
  dont i see what my dear

  miss walker dropped her eyes and
began to play with the topmost button
of his coat surely-surely you
understand surely you must have
guessed it by this time

  bless me guessed what

  why-why dont you see that mr
stuveysant wrote nothing but the truth
in that letter dont you see that he
has married miss walker and-and
that i am phyllis sands

 eh lorimer stared open-
mouthed what whats that you

are phyllis-phyllis sands-

  of course she nodded calmly as
if the elaborate deception she had prac-
ticed were the most natural thing in
the world so you see youll have
to learn to call me phyllis instead of
virginia in short as mr jellibond
would say i am the late silas q lori-
mers ward the identical person whom
he wished you to marry and whom you
cruelly rejected she folded her
hands in characteristic fashion and
looked at him meekly

  great glory said lorimer and
mopped his brow you-you must
give this time to soak in i dare say
im as stupid as they make them for
ive never suspected this for a moment
and so you are phyllis sands you
rank little fraud and hypocrite he
took her by the shoulders and shook
the vxrovigal



her after this how am i to believe
anything you say a fine promising
outlook for a prospective husband i
must say

  phyllis sands in all humbleness and
contrition hung her golden head but
then you see i didnt know you were
going to be-be my prospective hus-
band and so i considered the decep-
tion perfectly legitimate

  legitimate how what put the
idea into your head

  why i suppose the distressing
clause in my guardians will i didnt
want to be married or marry anybody
merely for money any more than you
did i suppose that was my privilege
wasnt it

  oh certainly

  well then you see mr lorimer
had often spoken about you pointing
out your many admirable qualities and
i knew it was his dearest wish that we
should marry i heard so much about
you that i came to hate your very
name 

   can quite understand that said
lorimer of course my uncle didnt
know how id panned out but did
you 

  not until that night in augerots
you see i was at college when mr
lorimer died and id been there for
four years i never knew how ill he
really was for he kept it from me-if
he himself realized it-and said that
a rest in the sanitarium was all he re-
quired youve wondered i suppose
how i happened to be so familiar with

your uncles affairs-

  yes you said miss sands told you
-miss sands being yourself

  of course she laughed so you
see it wasnt an untruth at all well
that night in the restaurant i was on
my way to albany having just heard
of mr lorimers death you know that
virginia walker was my roommate at
bryn mawr and that were as thick
as thieves well she accompanied me

-though you didnt see her-and it was
her father i was dining with-though
you didnt see him either

  then it was mr walker who gave
me such a rousing send-off laughed
lorimer did you know i was your
late guardians nephew 

  yes for mr walker said enough
to make me believe that you must be
but i said nothing to him of what i
thought i knew it was inevitable that
you and i would meet eventually dur-
ing the winding up of mr lorimers
affairs and so i hit on the idea of
changing names with miss walker let
us say i wanted the opportunity of find-
ing out for myself the real you and

that i did so-

  or which may be nearer the truth
that you didnt want me pestering you
with offers of marriage you having
good reason to believe me a fortune
hunter and prodigal 

  perhaps she said demurely at
all events i had no difficulty in per-
suading virginia walker to agree to
the scheme you see it presented no
obstacles for palestine didnt know
either of us and you had never seen
miss sands mr owen the lawyer
was the only other person that

knew-

  why the old hypocrite exclaimed
lorimer he never even as much as
hinted it to me

  certainly not after giving me his
solemn promise not to he would have
heard from me if he had i can tell
you you see ive known him for-
oh ever so long-and i can make him
do just whatever i like indeed i can
you remember he was your uncles
lawyer it was he whom i was seeing
to-day thats why  could not accept

your invitation to lunch-

  you never meant to meet me at the
station either accused lorimer

  no i didnt for i knew i wouldnt
be through in time for that train and
of course i didnt want to let you know


the popular magazine

who i was with you would have
thought it strange to say the least to
find your stenographer lunching inti-
mately with your late uncles lawyer
all the same you need not try to in-
sinuate that i was indirectly responsible
for the robbery-oh yes i know whats
in your mind-for in the first place
you promised solemnly to take the bal-
ance in a draft and in the second
you promised with equal solemnity not
to wait for me you know you prom-
ised that

  did i  asked lorimer ingenuously
you see i wasnt in a condition to
remember anything for you must
know that i meant to propose to you
on the way home

  really i dont believe anything of
the kind why if youd only been
thoughtful enough to drop a hint i
would have broken my appointment
with mr owen

  and about this affair of stuvey-
sants  did you know  come now 
no really she protested it was
as much a surprise to me as to you
though of course i knew it would only
be a question of time with them it
wasnt planned im sure for virginia
would have said something about it
told me she could no longer keep up
the deception for of course she would
have to tell mr stuveysant all about it
im sure the whole thing was sponta-
neous and that theres a letter or tel-
egram from virginia waiting for me
at home then when mr stuveysant
learned of the deception i suppose the
idea occurred to him of writing you
such a letter for he would have no
reason to think you would believe it
for a moment he did not know that
i had gone to albany also he thought
i would be here in the office and that
you would then see that i must be
phyllis sands and not miss walker
circumstances just happened to give
that letter a corroboration which mr

stuveysant couldnt have foreseen or
expected

  its all very simple now remarked
lorimer and i suppose there was no
excuse for me thinking what i did
all the same when a mans in love he
can think and believe anything

  men havent any monopoly on that
remarked phyllis sands there was
a time when i thought my deception
was going to prove a frightful boomer-
ang it promised to succeed only too
well you-you were becoming en-
tirely too good friends with miss
sands for my comfort oh yes you
were and virginia and i-well our
friendship was only saved by my dis-
covering that her real interest was for
mr stuveysant and by her discover-
ing that i-that i didnt exactly hate
you

  a condition not unknown to stu-
veysant and myself said lorimer
we had some little understanding of
our own which you see didnt do me
any good when it came to the pinch
but heres another thing i want to
know that two thousand which the
psuedo miss sands wished to invest
in the business-it was yours all the
time

  how clever you are to have guessed
it she looked at him the love light
breaking in her eyes you dear stupid 
you said you believed i would stop
at nothing to advance the interests of
the business you insisted on think-
ing my one and only thought was for
the business dont you see that-that
the business meant you

chapter xx

lorimer talks business

  early the next morning the following
telegram arrived from stuveysant

  returning to-night have just heard of
the fire buck up have received the paren-
tal blessing and we can get from the gov-
ernor all money necessary
the cpcrpoigal



  lorimer at the office had just fin-
ished reading it when mr delaney and
his famous facial disturbance presented
themselves

  say youre certainly playing in hard
luck he began his cold gray eye again
failing to show the sympathy his words
were apparently meant to convey
have just heard about you being held
up and robbed last night saw it in
the mornin paper why didnt you tell
me about it last night

  lorimer shrugged the fire put it
out of my mind i had too many other
things to think about

  thanks to his understanding with the
old chief of police a very restricted ac-
count of the affair had appeared in the
press the names of simpson and
okeefe not being mentioned he had
learned that they left the freight train
at some point between albany and new
york and thus far no trace had been
found of them it was a question if
they would ever be captured

  certainly hard luck reiterated mr
delaney never knew what hit you
eh and they got away before you
come round

  yes replied lorimer

  too badmurmured the other i
always said there was a lot of tough
characters round here that ought to be
run out of town but what can you ex-
pect with such a chief of police you
lost fifteen hundred eh it must have
cleaned you out

  it did

  too bad murmured mr delaney
again then his manner changed and
he added briskly well are you ready
to talk business

  lorimer nodded im sorry to dis-
appoint you a second time he said
slowly but ive decided not to sell
the franchise after all as for lori-
mer park however ive no objection
to letling it go now that the whole
place needs rebuilding i can find less
valuable property for a ball ground and
b

so im willing to sell ill take ten
thousand for it

  youll what shouted delaney re-
moving his cigar and staring at the
other ten thousand i guess you
will take ten thousand for it-if you
get it ten thousand ha ha thats
good

  well said lorimer mildly thats
my price and you might tell brand 
co-if you happen to know that firm
-that it wont go for a cent less i
dare say it will be worth all of ten
thousand some day when the town de-
cides to make these improvements-

  theres nothing to that interrupted
delaney i guess it wont be in your
time anyway mr lorimer it aint a
question of what it may be worth some
day but what you can get for it now
im here to talk business to offer you
a fair price which you can take or leave
just as you please for i can bid it

  no interrupted lorimer it wont
be in the market mr delaney you
tell brand  co if you know the firm
that ten thousand is my price and that
if they want lorimer park at that fig-
ure they will have to close with it to-
day for on monday i start rebuilding
yes you do-not said delaney
with a laugh take that bull out and
shoot it its no use bluffing i know
how youre fixed

  im afraid you dont mr delaney
you only think you do you see a
whole lot has happened since our talk
last night in the first place youll
be glad to hear that i can afford now
to do what i like with lorimer park
-even build a carnegie library on it
the fact is ive just come into one
hundred and fifty thousand under my
late uncles will also i-ve found an
investor with an equal sum at her dis-
posal so the palestine baseball club
is ready to resume business at the old
stand and there will be three hundred
thousand dollars-not cents-back of it
the popvlar magazine

we are going to form a company with
mr stuveysant and mr magee as
shareholders

  delaney said nothing he could find
nothing to say he was a good judge
of men and words and something told
him lorimer was speaking the truth
and as he sat silent the cigar poised
irresolutely the door opened and ma-
gee entered looking more prosperous
and jovial than delaney had ever seen
him for a beaten team these two-
lorimer and magee-certainly failed to
look the part

  mornin said the manager nod-
ding carelessly at delaney then he
turned to lorimer say boss clarks
ready any time you want him

  veteran though he was the cigar in
delaneys hand trembled so that its ash
spilled all down the front of his vest
he coughed and lost color it was his
first intimation that clark was not
safely hidden in new york

  lorimer adopted a confidential tone
you see mr delaney i recognized
clark as one of the thugs and i also
know the names of the other two-
simpson and okeefe we caught
clark last night as he was attempting
to leave on the fast freight and we
have him under lock and key ive
kept it quiet so far because if clark
goes to trial he will seriously compro-
mise a leading citizen of this town-
and albany

  mr delaney made a heroic effort to
light his cigar but the nonchalant at-
tempt was a failure he had lost the
last vestige of color

  aint lookin very well this mornin
mr delaney remarked magee with
evident sympathy dont you feel real
good mebbe you caught cold down
to the freight station last night i was
there and felt a bit chilly myself

  the other looked as if the under-
taking being physically possible he
would like to make mr magee very
warm

  we have a good description of
simpson and okeefe pursued lori-
mer in the same confidential tone and
i dare say theyll be caught in the long
run if not mr clark knows enough
to give this leading citizen that ive
mentioned very serious trouble you
see the real motive behind the robbery
was to get rid of me this leading citi-
zen whose name i wont even mention
to you mr delaney wished to put me
out of business he didnt want me
here in palestine he didnt want me
to make a success of things naturally
i feel resentful over the underhand
methods he used and yet this morning
owing to my recent good fortune im
in a magnanimous frame of mind so
heres what ive decided to do im
going to let mr clark off-he was only
a tool didnt profit by the robbery and
hasnt escaped punishment of a sort-
and im going to let the leading citizen
off-providing i sell lorimer park this
morning for ten thousand dollars i
want to sell it it is worth perhaps
eighty-five hundred but the other fifteen
hundred will repay me for the fifteen
hundred stolen from me and now in
the possession of simpson and okeefe
thats why my price is ten thousand
mr delaney and not a cent less
otherwise only for this unfortunate
robbery my price would have been
eighty-five hundred

  lorimer looked very directly at mr
peter delaney as he said all this but
the others eyes had sought the floor
a slow grin had enveloped magees
wide mouth

  so thats all the business i have to
discuss said lorimer and i hope ive
made myself plain ten thousand and
the papers signed this morning other-
wise mr clark goes to trial and tells
all he knows i know mr delaney
that like myself you have the good
fame of palestine at heart and dont
want to see this leading citizen in trou-
ble however dont let anything ive
the pzdigal

always wanted lorimer park and so	tine and a leading citizen-whose iden-

and a leading citizen whose name i	added slowly maybe this leading cit-

wall street and number thirteen

vour wall street broker simply cant get a customer to trade in an office
that is situated on the thirteenth floor that floor is the bugaboo of the
renting agent in the financial district and odd as it may seem there are many
buildings in wall street from which the ill-omened numerals are banished

    it is not unusual to overhear the following dialogue in an express elevator
in the district

    here boy you took me past my floor

    where did you want to get off boss

     i told you when we started the thirteenth floor

    the elevator boy grins youre in the wrong building mister we aint
got a thirteenth floor

    there is the atlantic building at the southwest corner of william and
wall streets an imposing skyscraper in a conspicuous location sheltering great
banking institutions and law corporations and yet it recognizes the thirteen
superstition

    a structure with a white marble front at no  william street a few
doors north of  wall the home of the second largest banking house in the street
has no thirteenth floor or at least a floor numbered thirteen is nonexistent

    many a building originally designed as a home for stock exchange houses
omits the number thirteen from its elevator floor dial no  broadway which
was constructed especially with the idea of attracting commission houses has
the thirteenth floor eliminated from its make-up

    but it has become the custom for the ultramodern buildings to defy the
superstition among these are the twin buildings of the hudson terminal the
singer building the city investing building and finally the woohvorth build-
ing the peer of all in which the thirteenth floor was preserved it must be
taken into consideration however that these later buildings have moved away
from the limits of the old financial quarter and are leaving its traditions and
predilections behind them still stbck-commission houses will never be found
on the thirteenth floor and their feeling on the subject seems to be shared by
bond and mining houses and financial corporations
the coup

by w douglas newton

   here is a pen plied with the deadly precision of a machine gun by a
writer of arresting power it is the story of an aviator in war time and
you wont envy him his job swinging through the strings of shrapnel
smoke his plane flecked and gashed with shell fragments but glory awaited
him-him and the observer with his chart and his colored pencils mr
newton doesnt tell us which of the armies was to be aided by the coup of
the aviators being neutral you wont quarrel with the omission you ap-
preciate as we do stirring deeds whether done by frenchmen or germans
or british

the aviator regretted the military
proscription that forbade him
cigarettes on active service

       this aviator used cigarettes as
an actor-manager used limelight-that
is to accent the value of dramatic mo-
ments and just now he was experi-
encing such a moment he had flown
in a number of contests and under all
manner of splendid conditions and he
had used his cigarette with such effect
that even newspaper men had made epi-
grams about it he had however never
started to fly under conditions so dra-
matically spectacular as on this occasion
when he must fly without a cigarette
and he felt that he was not obtaining
the most savor out of life

  there was a royal personage and an
assortment of generals to see him start
and every one of them had a name that
was going to appear in the history they
were now making behind each of
them trailed a penumbra of officers who
appeared to have made their costumes
deliberately gaudy so that on a future
day a historian might be able to write
of any one of the generals that his
simple and plain-cut uniform was in

sharp contrast to the brightness and
glitter of his staff it was curious how
one got this effect though every man
on the field was garbed in a field uni-
form that looked like a color scheme
made up of snuff and chalk there was
a peppering of officers about the big
clearing too a sick biplane in the throes
of misfiring and a string of portable
hangars with planes folded inside them
the place was germed with soldiers
they stood in ranks under the trees
they spilled themselves over the clearing
doing many things with wooden ges-
tures now and then a squad would
cut across the muddy grass their
legs going all together like the beat of
a metronome the trees cut off the
field from the world like a curtain the
sky was flat and gray and it seemed
that it had been cut so that the trees
might be inlaid upon it beyond the
trees and even it seemed beyond the
sky there was an eternal and frightful
uproar of great guns the aviator knew
by the mad incoherence and the huge
and utter senselessness of the sound
that a great battle was in progress he
knew he was going to fly over that mon-
the coup



strous battle he felt that it was not
at all improbable he would be the means
of winning it he had been deliber-
ately chosen for this great moment and
this great end that was why he
wanted the cigarette it was the most
important and dramatic moment of his
career

  the royal personage and the gen-
erals had spoken to him remembered
his past achievements and impressed
upon him the gravity and wonder of
this flight he was about to make thanks
to them he quite understood that a na-
tion was depending solely on him now
royalty and the generals were impress-
ing the importance of the occasion on
the observer the aviator was a little
contemptuous of observers mainly be-
cause they were usually cavalry officers
and because they were unable to fly a
machine as he flew one but mostly be-
cause they were able to make military
sense out of the jumble of lozenges and
dots and blobs that form the aviators
eye view of a battle area and he was ut-
terly incapable of doing so they were
necessities whose importance was a
trifle exaggerated and thus he was net-
tled to note that the generals were in
danger of making the observer imagine
that a nation depended solely on him
too he began to wish that he had
taken a stiff course in military topog-
raphy and scouting so that he could go
up alone earn his laurels without di-
vision

  he busied himself in the padded lux-
ury of his seat in an ostentatious prepa-
ration for his flight he touched the
buttons of the nest of drawers under
the steel dashboard he knew every-
thing was ready but it gave him a sense
of efficiency to look again the vacuum
flask with its hot drink was in its hold-
ers the chocolate cubes in their tinfoil
were easy to the reach the petrol-satu-
rated sponge for cleansing the goggles
was inevitably to hand the tiny flask
of brandy the first-aid packet even the

half lemon to stay the thirst were all
as they should be against the luxu-
rious upholstering that extended from
the club-chair seat along the sides of the
limousine the revolver swung from its
holster eager to the fingers

  at the observers post behind all was
in readiness too the flask chocolate
and the rest were all in their places
the large-scale ordnance map on its
rollers with the pad beneath it to give
firmness to the recording pencil could
be swiveled over the observers lap at
a touch even the sharpened pencils of
various colors that were to mark the
map with the various positions of hos-
tile troops swung from their strings
ready for immediate use the bombs
on their drum were poised for the pres-
sure of the foot lever that would set
them free-all was ready

  still the generals endangered the
modesty of the observer still they
seemed determined to make him think
that a mere passenger who could per-
ceive at so many hundred feet up that
a worm with kinks in it was a battery
moving into action was more important
than the man who drove the machine
and who couldnt tell the difference be-
tween a flanking force and a convales-
cent camp

  but the aviator was soon able to show
them their mistake in a minute the
observer had saluted with a perfection
that made the aviator sneer had
marched to the machine and climbed
into his seat behind that was the fly-
ers chance without parade he got
his engine going he let the huge and
exquisite thing race for a moment in
spite of the silencers his attuned ear
sensing its growth of power then on
the high beat of speed he started the
propeller and with a swinging rush
lifted the bus sheer off the ground
he hoped the medal-spotted generals
would appreciate the skill of that for
it was a fine feat his wheels could not
have touched ground for more than a


the vovulak magazine

few yards then up he went up in a
vivid spiral climbing the sky in a lad-
der of flight in seven minutes his dials
showed seven thousand feet and after
that he steadied went shooting like a
star across the trees into the noise of
the battle

  as the trees were topped the huge
sound of fighting blew into their faces
like a gale it flung itself at them
strove to exterminate them by mere
force of incredible uproar monstrosi-
ties of slaughter must be going on just
beyond the trees was the first thought
beyond the trees the ground was bare
and a dreary swing of flat land slipped
toward a drab horizon smoldering in
haze in its giant stride the hundred-
horse-power engine swept the machine
across the plain leaped at the haze
and the haze was war

  the observer suddenly called out and
for a moment the aviator wrenched his
eyes from the multiplicity of gauges
and controls to look earthward even
over the telephone he had heard the note
of elated satisfaction in the observers
voice the plane had passed the steam-
ing line of the enemys battle front now
and was working down to scouting level
as it turned and swept the area behind
that line from end to end the aviator
looked downward steadily probing the
surface of the earth to find out what
had made the observer so happy he
saw what he had seen on many a battle-
field-clusters of mushroom men
worms of men all set on the green and
dun array of lozenges that were the
fields of the battle area the clusters
and worms looked like every one of the
clusters and worms he had ever seen
just as futile and as uninspiring as ever
he frowned he would have given
half his skill to wrench some meaning
out of that huddled array he frowned
again he was wondering what was
lacking in his intellectual make-up that
prevented his making sense out of the

military array mottling the earth be-
neath he called into the free end of
his telephone

  whats doing anything going
forward 

  anything called the thin excited
voice anything man its every-
thing those big pots were right its
big man the biggest thing of this
war big lord its too big for the
world

  the aviator cursed him for an ex-
cited and indefinite enthusiast

  yes he shouted back his voice
fighting the back draft of the propeller
yes i can guess all that from your
chuckles but what does it mean
mean what does it mean but
man surely you can see that the
fellers an infernal prig considered
the aviator

  its written across the whole world
chuckled the observer like a large-
size advertisement for soap why-
why-it just jumps up at you the
biggest greatest most magnificent thing
most magnificent coup for the flying
arm in this war and were in it
its ours man its ours and all its
glory

  idiot snarled the aviators mind
if you must talk why not talk facts
majors crowns and medals and
mention in the dispatches pensions big
talk in all the newspapers heroics no
end-thats what it means well be
great national celebrities were going
to win this battle where we might be
beaten were going to win this war
the whole bloomin hope of the nation
is now with us

  triple idiot thought the aviator
but he began to glow began to get ex-
cited he was out for all these glori-
ous things he began to see them com-
ing on him in a shower but he wished
the fool would tell him something defi-
nite

  yes he snapped again across the
telephone he wished he could see the
the coup



 man and wrench something from him
 face to face yes but what does it
 mean how does it effect our force
 what are these chaps about to do and
 what ought our men do while they are
 doing it

 ware archibald yelled the
 voice across the phone theyre going
 to kill us dead if they can and i
 dont blame em we just kill them if
 they dont

   somewhere ahead of the swooping
 plane there broke out the thin scream
 of an upsoaring shell four hundred
 yards away well off the line of flight
 too the air abruptly shattered a vivid
 spark like the flash of magnesium burst
 from nothing and a dull green coronal
 of smoke gushed out from its edges
 the eyes of the aviator came back to
 his work again he banked his ma-
 chine with a delicate and superb skill
 flew by the smoke in a great double s
 even as the gout of green fume hung
 in the air six more of the anti-aircraft
 shrapnels flicked upward by archi-
 bald burst in the precise places where
 the aeroplane was not with the grace
 of a russian dancer the machine flitted
 pirouetting among the hanging clouds
 of the shell smoke

   good man snapped the voice of
 the observer now turn go back
 straight for a mile then turn and do
 the ground again ive got to get this
 thing as precise and certain as a blue
 print and for the lords sake be care-
 ful theyre going to do their best
 to stop us theyve got to it means
 the end of them if we get this news
 off and safe-the end of them if we
 make our scoop the annihilation of
 our army if they wing us theyre
 going to try hard look out for em
 in a long curve of delight the plane
 came about flowed round swooped
 forward again  its return journey
 but the aviator was not pleased with
 the sweet working of his machine he
 was scowling his excitement at the

huge meaning behind his movements
his burning desire to know just what
great thing they were doing just what
honors and glories he was even now
piling up for himself chafed his spirit
and made him angry why should this
barrack-room observer act like a minor
sphinx why shouldnt he know what
was going on why should he be baf-
fled in this way he would have
spoken his mind savagely but events
were keeping him busy

  they were flying low on a scouting
level and the enemy beneath were mak-
ing it hot anti-aircraft guns from a
dozen positions were pumping shell
after shell at them all the infantry in
the lines seemed to have taken fire
and the atmosphere became lethal with
the perpetual upspouting of bullets-and
it is riflemen in mass that form the
terror of the flyer an archibald on
a bumping motor lorry was trying to
follow them along a tortured road in
a minute there would be planes up
from the enemys drome probably
mounted with a spitting mitrailleuse for
their destruction the course of events
was lively the aviator had uses for
every fiber of his wits

  back now came the tantalizing
voice of the observer over the phone
its great its vast our names are
in history man after this well get
government grants well have made
the greatest victory of modern time
possible saved the greatest debacle
oh you cant tell how vast it is and
ive got it all right i think but go over
the ground just once must be sure of
it must

  sure of what snarled the aviator
sure of what-what is it

  two rifle bullets one after the other
went through the rubberoid skin of the
planes with a double zug some-
where close up to them a shrapnel went
off like the smashing of a hundred
plates the aviatbr never saw the ex-
plosion but an acrid whiff of cordite


the povulwr magazine

stung the back of his throat and he
heard the soft bullets smacking on the
steel plates of the fusilage hot specks
of brass from a struck cable strainer
whipped his cheek too the steel of
the fusilage roared again as the spate
of a mitrailleuse caught it for a frac-
tion then the plane was rushing on-
ward again in the smooth waters of the
air not at all damaged

  the great plane kicked a little against
his wrists as the air punch from the
exploding shell hit the machine but
the aviators wrists were those of a
jockey and he eased the bus steady as
a jockey masters a nervous horse the
shells with their sparkling come and
go of core hung in air about him but
he swung his course consummately and
escaped he was thrilled the excite-
ment the knowledge of the big thing
he was accomplishing the hope of the
big and glorious rewards made his
blood race

  how goes it he shouted into the
phone how goes it

  oh fine answered the voice in a
muffled accent and the aviator knew
the meaning of that could sec the ob-
server hanging over his powerful
glasses hanging over the map on the
rollers could see the swift play of the
colored pencils as corps batteries bri-
gades regiments and squadrons were
ranked on the ordinance surface oh
fine cried the thick voice im dot-
ting my is but ive got it all safe
no mistake weve made our scoop

  how do we scoop cried the ex-
cited pilot

  one minute answered the observer
i must get it all down sure turn
home at that village and get up too
man the place is a measles of guns

  as the plane went up and round the
atmosphere began to quiver with explo-
sion the air all about them flowered
with the sinister blooms of shrapnel
smoke the air was tingling with the
whistling upshoot of nickeled bullets

the steel sides of the plane began to
sound like a galvanized roof in a hail-
storm there was the cluck and ring
of bullets on the whirling propeller a
cable stung and parted and as it curled
up it snatched a strip out of the avi-
ators leather helmet and drew blood
from his head but he was round
mounting flying home

  he was exultant though he knew he
was not yet safe it was not shrapnel
alone that the enemy used every now
and then his ear caught above the rush
of the wind the thick and clogged deto-
nation of a high-power shell once he
scudded through the tail of their thick
and greasy smoke and it nearly choked
him to unconsciousness but he was
exultant they had made the scoop of
the war they were henceforth to be
creatures of fabulous glory and fabu-
lous reward

  now and then the beggars came close
a big shell smashed with almost stun-
ning effect right overhead the plane
swung and dived under the air disturb-
ance but his jockeyship soon righted
that the cables sang and thrilled with
the vibration the plane surface was
flecked and gashed with shell fragments
and the plates on the body clanged but
the aviator managed his machine like
a great general he handled her su-
perbly  he swung her easy and brought
her clear

  and he knew he could and would
bring her through giant success was
speeding them forward they could
not fail now they could not make mis-
takes they could not be beaten they
swam at swift gait through the thin-
ning strings of shrapnel smoke the
whistling of the bullets died the heavy
thudding of the great shells sagged be-
hind they were away and safe they
were taking the greatest news of the
war to headquarters safely they were
planing straight to splendor and to glory
not castor and pollux riding the wind
to the victory of regillus could have
the coup



made progress so intense with vast pur-
pose and immortal honor as their prog-
ress back to headquarters with the
greatest news of the war with all the
means and chances of great victory

  down down in one long volplane
that sang through space like a chord
of undying music they passed over the
plain they leaped the trees the fly-
ing ground burst to life as they rushed
earthward officers and men ran about
in the manner of excited ants the
generals were running the royal per-
sonage was running the news was
certainly vast it was news of vic-
tory or annihilation as the observer
had said the movements of the gen-
erals proved that

  the mind and heart of the aviator
went wild with joy he knew fame
stood ready with her laurels he knew
that fortune was unclasping her purse
he knew that the immortal pen of his-
tory was entering his name  the scroll
of transcendental and valorous events
he reached the ground stopped his
machine sprang to his feet waved the
scampering generals on with a joyous
arm

  a coup he yelled a coup the
greatest news of the war

  there was cheering all over the flying
ground the generals ran forward
some smiling some endeavoring to be

dignified and to scowl down this the-
atrical robert browning method of
gloating over success the aviator
yelled his joy again then he stopped
all the generals had stopped they
were looking with startled eyes at the
aeroplane at the observers seat a
hand of ice caught at the aviators
heart he swung about glared at the
observer

  the observer was lying back in his
seat the jerk of landing must have
flung him back his neck was stretched
upward in a dreadful manner prac-
tically all of his face certainly all his
forehead had been carried away by a
shell fragment the aviator remem-
bered the big shell that had burst above
them remembered that the observer was
the only one who knew what was going
on behind the enemys line he gulped
and then gulped again after all-
after all there was the map

  he almost flung himself across to
the observers perch to get hold of the
map-the map that would tell the tale
of the great coup

  where the map had been a few
ragged strips of printed linen-backed
paper fluttered in the wind there was
no map the shell fragment that had
slain the observer had torn the map
away dashed it in strips across the
heavens nothing remained

his x mark

ccientific progress has caused the passing of another good two-century-old
custom from the early days when writing was a rarity to the present
time it was customary to regard the x mark of an illiterate person on legal
or financial documents as entirely valid

    but the x mark has passed away forever wall street banks and now more
especially savings banks have adopted the finger-print system first introduced
by the detective bureaus for the identification of their illiterate depositors on
making his original deposit the illiterate must first dab his thumb or forefinger
on a pad containing printers ink and affix the characteristic lines of his cuticle
to the depositors identification card in drawing money his finger print is com-
pared with the one on file bank cashiers consider the finger print more accurate
than a signature for the signature alters during the course of years whereas
the cuticle of an adult person remains unchanged throughout a lifetime

by holworthy hall

author of pepper the terrible freshman etc

in which james p mchenry begins his career as a theatrical promoter once in a hundred times there
is money in the angel business it looked to pepper mchenry that this was the hundredth time

seated at the window of their
new office on fifth avenue both
officers of the cambridge com-
pany were so deeply absorbed in
contemplation of the traffic that at first
they paid no attention to the stenogra-
pher who was trying to announce a
client

  fives full of fours said dilling-
ham noting the license number of an
expensive automobile thats another
for me

  you wait a while the bus is mine
four sevens its 

  only limousines count pepper his
partner reminded him a bus isnt a
limousine

  why isnt it dont you call it a
closed car

  but look here suppose a truck
came along with the sides boarded up
would that be a limousine

  sure it would i guess you saw it
coming didnt you 

  they peered eagerly for the number
of the approaching truck

  well i dont think id call it one
said dillingham the number was


  decision stands-youve got six
high mine-mines -a straight
thats four dollars and a half you owe
me

  mr westervelt to see you re-
peated the stenographer for the third
time the partners turned simultane-
ously and made for their desks

 send him in commanded mc-
henry grabbing a fountain pen and set-
ting himself to write furiously on a
memorandum pad dillingham less en-
ergetic contented himself with opening
half a dozen volumes of the business
library and spreading them out on his
blotter mr westervelt entering
briskly from the tiny reception room
naturally gathered the impression that
they were busy young men with not
much time to spare

  mr westervelt sat down carefully
arranged his trousers to prevent bagging
at the knees crossed his neatly spatted
ankles threw open his coat to display
an angora waistcoat of vigorous pat-
tern and introduced himself

  im h payson westervelt he said
youve probably seen me play

  oh certainly agreed mchenry
hospitably hundreds of times
dillingham scribbled hastily on a
scrap of paper and held up to the
presidents scrutiny the question
baseball piano or movies but pep-
per heeded him not

  well continued the client some-
body told me youre looking for in-
vestments so i thought id come in and
hand you a tip first off am i right
are you in the market

  thats our business-whats the
idea 

  the idea is this he hitched his
chair nearer mchenry and began to
tap him affectionately on the arm ive
mheny and dillingham angels



got an option on the theater in middle-
burgh connecticut for ten weeks be-
ginning february stock you know
now stocks always been a flivver in
middleburgh because they tried to play
twenty weeks the people got tired of
it ten weeks is just about right i
can pick my company in half an hour
after i get the backing and ive got a
schedule of expenses right here he
laid it on the desk bowed to it and
to mchenry rent five thousand
company a thousand a week royalties
and scenery fifteen hundred advertis-
ing a thousand incidentals one thou-
sand eighteen five total-call it
twenty thats twenty thousand dol-
lars for a ten weeks season or two
thousand a week the house seats
about fifteen hundred and is worth
about eight hundred dollars at regular
prices

  thats eight hundred if we play to
capacity in the evening and half price
for matinee every day makes twelve
hundred a day or seventy-two hundred
a week which is to say that we make
money if only one seat out of three is
taken  what do you think of it 

  if it didnt cost anything it would
be a wonder said mchenry but
whats the rest of the narrative

  h payson westervelt hitched still
nearer and tapped mchenry over the
lungs

  you put up five thousand in cash
he said and well split five thou-
sand would carry us nearly three weeks
if we didnt take in a cent if we play
to a third of the house well make
four hundred a week two hundred
apiece and that would give you forty
per cent for a ten weeks investment
which is at the rate of two hundred
per cent a year but well do better
than that we ought to clear nine or
ten thousand apiece easy why think
what other producers have done look
at the money there is in it if you

get the crowd coming-why its a
cinch

  the scheme is for us to put up five
thousand  what do you put up 
character said mr westervelt
tapping his own chest as a diversion
individuality prestige experience
acquaintance i manage and play
heavy parts i draw only a nominal
salary ill gamble with you do you
think id stake my professional repu-
tation in stock if i wasnt sure of it
its rather out of our line ob-
served pepper thoughtfully to tell
the truth-well what do you think of
it pierce

  im not keen on it said dilling-
ham promptly

  mr westervelt turned his head and
offered the secretary of the cambridge
company a glance of mingled pain and
solicitude then beginning slowly but
throwing in the high speed as soon as
he was under good headway he hitched
his chair across to dillinghams desk

  you claim to be promoters he re-
marked blandly every time you pro-
mote anything you take a chance dont
you well unless you take all your
capital and bet it on the ponies can
you get any quicker action than -this
ten weeks and its all over you lose
five or you make ten you havent
had any experience in this game so you
dont think its on the square well
ill tell you just what ill do with you
ill take a salary of twenty-five-just
enough to live on ill gamble the whole
way with you

  the salary isnt important-

  you bet it is and i know what
you were thinking you were thinking
that id probably draw down a couple
of hundred a week whether the com-
pany makes any money or not werent
you 

  dillingham flushed

  the point interposed mchenry
isnt whether this particular scheme is
any good its whether we want to get


the vovulatr magazine

mixed up in any theatrical scheme or-
dinarily mr westervelt we like to
know what were getting into

  the client retreated from his in-
trenchment in front of dillingham to
a similarly strategic position in front
of pepper

  i dont- want you to put up a nickel
without getting a receipt for it he
stated i dont want you to make up
your minds until youve talked it over
with somebody-anybody find out
about middlcburgh-look over the pop-
ulation and see what business the the-
ater had last year ask about me-
but dont ask an agent ask anybody
else and if you want to come through
with live of em you can have your
own lawyer draw up a contract and
ill sign it before we go any farther
why dont you look me up ill give
you three days and then if you dont
want to sit in the game ill talk to some-
body else thats reasonable isnt it
he rose and put on his crushed velvet
hat you scout around and find out
if you think theres a possibility in it
so when i come back on thursday you
can say yes or no-or listen to some
more details is that all right 

  that sounds fair enough agreed
mchenry well expect to see you
thursday then

  thursday is right good afternoon
gentlemen

  dillingham waited until he heard
the outer door close

  look here pep he said why
didnt you turn him dowrn now whats
the use of waiting for three days we
dont want to get tangled up in a stock
company in middleburgh or any other
place

  take your time old top soothed
mchenry once in a hundred times
theres money in the angel business i
thought id call up a real actor i know
and quiz him about the general scheme
if he says its logical then well get

busy and get a report  this wester-
velt man

  youre not going out now are
you 

  i am said pepper its four
oclock and i can estimate within ten
feet of where i can find this lad to
save your breath ill tell you that its
only ten feet between the bar and the
opposite wall wait for me will you 
dillingham promised to wait and he
was pleasantly astonished when his
partner returned within the hour

  well he demanded whats the
story

  westervelt left his name didnt he
lets call him and have dinner together
somewhere

  your friend said its all right

  he as much as told me that its the
best scheme he ever heard in his life
did he actually say that

  why no admitted mchenry but
he said the same thing he said enough
to convince that were going to it hook
line and sinker if im any good as
a mind reader wrere going to clean
up a fortune my friend the actor says
its rotten

ii

  they were to open on saturday after-
noon on thursday dillingham left
his partner to consummate a little deal
in real estate and journeyed over to
middleburgh to look over the ground
and calculate the profits on friday
he wired mchenry to take the first
available train and mchenry took it
it brought him to middleburgh at seven
oclock in the evening dillingham was
waiting at the station

  whats the matter he demanded
why didnt you come sooner

  i did said pepper that is i
came sooner than i thought i could
whats eating you 

  nothing at all said dillingham bit-
terly this is a fine proposition this
is if we only had an animal act and a
mhencry and dillingham angels



few bags of peanuts we could hire a
vacant lot and call it a circus why-
your young friend westervelt had a
party this afternoon with a couple of
reporters and bought em a glass or
two of beer then he got to figuring
how much money wed make and
switched to high balls then he got
to figuring how much we might make
and the reporters made him see the logic
of setting up the champagne that ac-
counts for westervelt

  you dont mean hes passed out
gasped pepper

  not a bit of it i wish he had
hes bright and happy and full of bub-
bles of friendship and hes out calling
on the community

  is that all

  nearly all said dillingham with
some caution the leading lady says
she wont play in the same company
with him for a million dollars a min-
ute

  gosh said mchenry

  and the juvenile lead says wester-
velt promised him sixty a week and
hell take the six-forty-two to-morrow
morning if we dont write him a new
contract

  fine how about the sceneshift-
ers

  they went out on strike yesterday
afternoon its national and the
mayor has had a row with the owner
of the theater and to get even he says
lies going to close up our show on
the grounds that its immoral-even if
its uncle toms cabin
altogether said mchenry placidly
it begins to look like a gilt-edged in-
vestment

  dont waste any time fooling pep
what are we going to do

  thats simple the first thing is to
get the crowd together ill try to tame
this westervelt person and you take

charge of the leading lady-

  a lot of good thatll do dont
you get it we havent a theater pep

and we havent any scenery and we
havent anybody to handle it

  well even if we had we couldnt
give a show without the actors said
pepper you can melt the heart of
the lady cant you

  im not so sure about that

  i am you pretend youre an idi-
otic freshman and shes senior presi-
dent at wellesley ill bet you a hat
she falls for it

  well of course she does think im

a pretty regular scout-

  thats enough go to it er-kiss
her if you have to offer to buy her
a yacht and a rope of pearls-or ill
tell you something better yet offer
to get out some new posters with her
name a foot higher for the love of
pete pierce i cant do everything
dillingham halted and pointed to the
street

  if you think youre so blamed
clever he said dispassionately see
what you can do with that

  mchenry looked he saw a dilapi-
dated barouche drawn by two rheu-
matic horses and driven by an aged
pirate with flowing black whiskers in
the barouche sat westervelt noncha-
lantly bowing right and left to the pop-
ulace

  leave him to me said mchenry
grimly

  with pleasure said dillingham
on stanley on intoned wester-
velt to the general public loose the
fiery and untamed steeds my king-
dom for a horse two kingdoms for
two horses three kingdoms for three
-why theres the angel

  you rush ahead to the hotel and
calm the lady said pepper hastily
here-take my bag with you and
to the great edification of the bystand-
ers he sallied forth into the street and
climbed up beside his manager

  i bid you welcome in the name of
the king greeted mr westervelt in
the name of the continental congress


the popular magazine

in the name of the commonwealth of
massachusetts

  hello old top said pepper cheer-
fully dont you want to go home
now 

  home there is no place like home
to me-thats why i stay away i care
not whith-her i goest as long as i goest
with thou-thee driver let go their
heads

  come  westervelt-lets go home
and have something to eat this open-
air stuff gives me a fearful appetite
say not so returned the manager
briskly i fain would linger linger
longer lucy let the droschke pro-
ceed 

  all right let it

  here a motor truck curved around
the corner and gave warning of its
presence by a croupy cough from the
horn

  curse them ejaculated the actor
theyre hooting me

  i cant drive no farther with them
horses protested the charioteer they
aint been fed yet

  await me await me said wester-
velt preparing to disembark never
shall it be said that i hostetter p wes-
tervelt countenance the suffering of
damn animals-i mean dumb animals
await me

  hold on there cried pepper

  he was too late westervelt had
dodged through a procession of motors
and delivery wagons and disappeared
through the swinging doors of the near-
est cafe when mchenry caught him
he had completed his arrangements for
the refreshment of the horses he had
bought two buckets of seltzer and a
package of shredded wheat biscuit

  now look here old top-

  avaunt said mr westervelt
begone beyond the alps lies-lie
a couple of hungry pomeranian per-
cherons thirsting mr bartender will
you take the banquet to the horses or
shall i bring the horses to the banquet

 look out old man-youll be
pinched

 pinched pinched by who by
whom by yon fell captain strict in
his arrest nay nay-mr mchenry
-i-im sorry but i think im going to
die in the house

  ill take care of him said pepper
to the amazed bartender all i want
is a closed hack or a taxicab cant
you scare up one for me

  sure agreed the man say ill
take back that there shredded wheat

but the seltzers no good now-

  l-let vie pay stammered mr wes-
tervelt only-only im afraid-im
afraid ill have to b-borrow the money
from somebody-all ive g-got is six-
teen cents and-and a cigar certifi-
cate-

  five minutes later mchenry escorted
his manager to a taxicab and propped
him carefully in one corner the thes-
pian somewhat revived by spirits of
ammonia kindly volunteered a free
reading which went about like this

friends romans countrymen lend me your
      ears-

i shall return them next saturday

the evil that men do lives after them-

in the shape of progeny to reap the benefit
of their life insurance so let it be
with the deceased

i come to bury caisar not to praise him
brutus hath told you that gesar was am-
bitious

but this is none of brutus funeral-

would that it were

cfesar hath brought many captives home to
      rome

who broke rock on the streets until their
ransoms did the general coffers fill
when the poor have cried casar hath wept
because it didnt cost anything and made
him

solid with the masses ambition should be
      made of sterner stuff

you all did see that on the lupercal
i thrice presented him a kingly crown
which thrice he did refuse-because it didnt
fit him

yet brutus says he was ambitious

brutus is a horse thief of the deepest dye

if you have tears prepare to shed them
     now-
mhencry and villlngham angels



  he paused and after a moment
prodded mchenry solidly in the ribs

  p-pick up your cues he com-
manded aggrievedly when i say-
tears-cry

  and in this manner james p mc-
henry passed the evening before the
beginning of his career as a theatrical
promoter

iii

   yet in spite of all the difficulties they
opened  saturday afternoon in the
meantime all that mchenry had done
was to interview the stage hands and
break the strike by the simple expedi-
ent of raising wages live dollars a week 
to locate an excellent lawyer and obtain
a temporary injunction to restrain the
mayor from stopping the performance
to groom his manager into presentable
shape and to complete dillinghams
negotiations with the leading lady it
wasnt until past noon that he was cer-
tain that there would be a matinee at
all and it wasnt until a quarter to two
that he was fairly confident of staging
it without a riot nevertheless they
opened according to schedule and they
played to an enthusiastic audience the
audience numbered a hundred and sixty-
one mostly in the balcony

  slightly disconcerted but still trust-
ing in the future they repeated the
same piece that evening this time the
audience was even more enthusiastic
and even larger fully two hundred
people dotted the orchestra and two
parties adorned the boxes one was
managed by the chief of police and
the other consisted of the staff of a
local newspaper and both came in as
guests of the promoters

  mchenry and dillingham talked it
over at great length after breakfast on
sunday each had a dozen reasons
why the first day shouldnt be profitable
but neither would concede that the
others reasons had a basis of common
sense then they summoned wester-

velt and heard his own reasons and
then they all disagreed violently

  anyway said pepper philosophi-
cally theres nothing to do till to-
morrow lets wait and see what sort
of houses we get after the criticisms

  all three drew some consolation from
the fact that the criticisms were very
good and none of them observed that
they were almost too good having
read in cold type the statement that
the company was the best seen in mid-
dleburgh in a decade and that wester-
velt ought to be compared with pooth
and that the leading lady was more
beautiful than lillian russell and more
talented than sarah bernhardt they
naturally expected to find the general
public forming in line at the box office
several hours before the curtain to
their horrified amazement a line was
formed only when some one stopped to
count his change and the man behind
him had to wait

  they played on monday to nearly
two hundred dollars westervelt said
it was because mchenry hadnt ad-
vertised properly and the leading lady
said it was because westervelt was a
poor actor and dillingham said it was
because the girls of middleburgh were
jealous of the leading ladys looks and
mchenry said it was because theyd
chosen a poor play and the papers
said that it was a great triumph and
that every one received a tremendous
ovation and that seats were selling six
weeks in advance

  now said mchenry it looks
easier you might as well run back
to new york pierce and hold down
the office and see if you cant scare
up enough business to pay my board
bill im going to stay here and try
to break even

  whats the use mourned dilling-
ham lets forget it and swallow the
loss and not waste any more time

  i am going to break even declared


the wvulatr magazine

pepper if it takes a leg weve got
to advertise

  the free advertising the papers gave
us did a lot of good didnt it

  it was too rich for their blood-a
different sort might put it over for us
as for instance queried his part-
ner

  well we thought this was a classy
town and it isnt we cant be high-
browish about it the scheipes to get
the crowd in any way but get it in
ive been scouting around the shops-
this is a great place for bargains
everything you see on main street is
a bargain sale or some cut-price ar-
rangement well well meet the com-
petition

 yes-seats for nineteen cents
marked down from a quarter scoffed
dillingham

 worse than that-much worse i
think well give a free seat any day this
week to any person named smith
dillingham stared for a moment and
then laughed

  fine-fine in other words open
the doors and let em all in

  but said pepper in order for any
smith to get a free seat he-or she-
must be accompanied by a jones who
pays cash two seats for the price of
one-get it

  i get it all right i think its rot-
ten 

  i dont think it over a minute its
a real bargain now two women can

get together and-

  had you thought asked dillingham
sardonically that there wouldnt be any
way of proving whether their names
were really smith or jones

  i hope they arent-the worse liars
they are the better theyll please me
a couple waltzes up to the box office
claims to be one smith and one jones
the jones buys a ticket and the smith
gets one right next to it for nothing
then next week well let the joneses
in free with the smiths buying tickets

  its a fine stunt-then instead of
getting real money for the few people
who would pay to get in we land just
half as much

  not a bit of it-well draw hundreds
of peoplj who arent coming now and
if they fill half the house well make
money if you can think of any better
idea lets have it dont be so tight
with your brilliant stunts

 a few years ago the mystery
scheme used to work mused dilling-
ham i wonder if these microbes
would fall for it run a photograph
of a man in the papers-the first fifty
people who stop him on the street and
call him by some funny name get a free
ticket it might stir up interest
that isnt bad admitted mchenry
well then we might as well get in
with both feet well offer prizes for
the best criticisms of the shows come
in see the show for half a dollar and
have a chance to make twenty-five by
writing a criticism

  then you want to have a voting
contest for the most popular member
of the company--

  the more i think of the bargain
idea the better i think it is pierce
well have a mark-down sale specials
every day wednesday matinee well
sell the fifty-cent seats for thirty-nine
cents thursday well sell the first ten
rows in the orchestra for fifty-three
cents marked down from seventy-five
weve got to get the zvomen coming-
its the women that pay the rent bill

  all this depends on westervelt-

 no-

  why of course it does if he has
another one of those special profes-
sional public appearances well be
queered for good

  mr h payson westervelt said
pepper will be one of the modelest
young men in middleburgh for the next
ten weeks-nine weeks and four days
to be exact ive got it on him of
course he does have a reputation for
mhenry and billing ham angels



carrying around the healthiest capacity
ever known to the metropolitan stage
but ill bet you a pair of shoe strings
that if you nail him now and ask him
what hell have hell name a pleasant
and familiar little decoction of two parts
of hydrogen and one of oxygen call
it a bet 

  ill bet i know where he is this
minute at the bar

  right-drinking seltzer

  that man said dillingham heat-
edly invented alcohol thats why
even with the advertising ideas im
not sold on the idea of wasting any
more time with him lets cut it out
and go home

  ill tell you what ill do-well go
down and find him if you can make
him take a drink on any pretext what-
soever ill quit and go home and pay
you twenty-five perfectly good seeds-
and if you cant you pay me twenty-five
and go home yourself and let me run
this thing to a finish

  dillingham reached for his hat
thats one bright spot he said hap-
pily that means that you lose twenty-
five more than  do come on
accordingly they found westervelt in
the grill

  greetings manager said dilling-
ham whats yours

 french vichy said westervelt
promptly

dillingham looked hard at mchenry
ill bet you ten dollars he con-
tinued that you cant drink a scotch
high ball with a spoon while im eating
a soda cracker

  ill do it with vichy agreed mr
westervelt

  no-scotch ill make it twenty
  it cant be done

  twenty-four dollars and seventy-
live cents said dillingham in despera-
tion mchenry chuckled

  hasnt he told you  inquired wes-
tervelt

 told me what

 b

  well if he hasnt im hanged if i
will you said you wouldnt until its
over he added accusingly to mchenry

 i havent told him- here

waiter youll have just time he ad-
vised his partner to join us in a fudge
sundae or something strong like that
before your train leaves whats yours
h payson

  french vichy said the actor stol-
idly

iv

  but after all the first shot of the
new campaign was aimed not at future
prospects but at present clients as the
curtain fell at the close of the tuesday
matinee james p mchenry appeared
before the audience and granted that
the leading man had a cold the come-
dian was suffering from hay fever and
that the heavy hadnt had time to learn
his part under the circumstances he
said there was nothing to dq but to an-
nounce a rebate any one who was dis-
satisfied with the performance could get
half his money back by applying at the
box office

  these are the days he said in con-
clusion when all advertising is guar-
anteed all right-when you come to a
comedy in this theater and dont laugh
you get your money back to-night you
can send all your friends theyll either
have a good time at the tew price of
fifty cents seventy-five or a dollar or
ill give em free seats for a tragedy
next week ladies and gentlemen i
thank you

  chiefly to test his good intentions a
few dozen of that audience actually did
halt at the box office and they found a
young man waiting for them with coin
of the realm at hand the plan struck
most of them as clever rather than busi-
nesslike but they were sufficiently af-
fected by the logic of it to give mc-
henry a little gratuitous publicity that
night the newspapers ran the story
on the first page directly above the an-


the cppulr magazine

nouncement that the smiths were finally
coming into their own the inevitable
result was that the company played to
good houses that day and it was soon
known that the smiths werent obliged
to prove their right to the patronymic

  before middleburgh had recovered
from the first two novelties it was in-
formed that on fridays and mondays
any person with four children over the
age of sixteen could get family tickets
for two dollars no matter whether the
offspring numbered the minimum of
four or a maximum of forty

  some of these folks may do a little
quiet borrowing from the neighbors for
the occasion said mchenry sagely
but the more the merrier now well
get ready for the big bang

  whats that demanded wester-
velt

  during the last week of this run
explained the promoter the evening
shows will be given by the regular com-
pany but the matinees will be pulled
off by local talent from the high school
theyll eat it alive wed better pick
the show and begin rehearsing em
hadnt we

  now look here if you try anything
like that youll be sorry ive seen
those things work out the youngsters
you pick will be tickled to death and so
will their parents-but the candidates
you reject will be sore as pups and so
will their parents and you lose out
in the ratio of about six to one

  guess again said mchenry im
going to have an entirely different cast
for every matinee every stage-struck
girl in the whole high school will be on
the boards there wont be any sore-
heads and well have the whole town
coming every day-to see their own
friends and then to see how much bet-
ter they are than the other peoples
friends

  were picking up right along-i
dont know that well need anything as
drastic as that

  we need every new twist we can
think up

  all right-but were getting respect-
able houses old man

  were breaking even-why not make
a little money

  i never refuse conceded the actor
if you think we can saparate any more
of these hardware syndicates from their
money by giving parts to the kinder-
garten pupils im perfectly willing to
buy a bib and begin rehearsals

  so mchenry visited the high school
and addressed the pupils in a speech
which sent more girls to their mirrors
than any event since rice powder was
invented subsequently he had the lead-
ing lady give a tea on the stage and
invite all the girls who thought they
would like to be actresses they came
in droves-the entire four classes of the
school a score of graduates eleven
clerks from local department stores and
the girl from the news stand at the rail-
road station the leading lady was im-
possibly sweet to them promised them
all the benefit of her coaching-mc-
henry had to raise her salary for it-
and suggested that they had better go
in training by attending as many profes-
sional performances as possible during
the next two months

  it was at about this period of the
worlds history that the spectators
found themselves within speaking dis-
tance of each other no longer could a
timid person attend one of mchenry
and dillinghams mammoth productions
and feel lonely and unprotected the
dead line flowed down from the fifty-
cent seats to the seventy-five down to
the first ten rows at a dollar and finally
during the fifth week into the boxes
it never happened that the company ac-
tually played to capacity but they did
have some splendidly profitable houses
and the sight of real money enraged
mchenry as the official color of his
alma mater is supposed to enrage the
bull
mhenry ant dillingham angels



  promptly he instituted special per-
formances with a proportion of the re-
ceipts designed for local charities the
rival factions of middleburgh rose to
the bait like hungry trout and for the
sake of the two hundred dollars mc-
henry offered to a hospital the hard-
ware section spent six hundred for re-
served seats and for the hundred and
fifty he considered appropriate to the
boys club the mill division bought out
the entire house

  on saturdays dillingham ran over
from new york and invariably he was
staggered by the improvement in the
balance sheet from an out-and-out
loss of thirteen hundred dollars the first
week the venture had progressed to
solvency by the sixth and made a hand-
some profit in the seventh and eighth

  the stage hands shifted scenery with
sober precision the mayor cut mc-
henry on the street and went to the
movies the leading lady found herself
the petof feminine society and wes-
tervelt consumed in two months more
vichy and seltzer than the majority of
men ever see in action

  this last was the only outcome which
seemed to dillingham unbelievable
from personal experience he knew that
pepper was capable of selling almost
anything tangible or intangible but
from what he knew of westervelt he
couldnt comprehend how even pepper
could have tamed him overnight when-
ever he inquired about it which wasnt
seldom mchenry assumed his most vir-
tuous air and merely said that it was his
well-known personal magnetism cou-
pled with his high principles and inher-
ent righteousness which had brought
about the change dillingham didnt
believe it but that was one of the worst
points about mchenry-you didnt be-
lieve half he said but you could never
tell which half to believe

  during the ninth week they played
 velvet and the tenth-if the ninth
was on velvet the tenth was on radium

six separate casts of high-school aspir-
ants graced the boards of the theater
during those afternoons their fami-
lies and friends held every seat under
the roof and stood ten deep in the rear
at night every one who had played that
afternoon came to compare their own
rendition with that of the professionals
and they fought for places with the cast
which was to play to-morrow afternoon
and wanted to pick up a few last point-
ers

  it was wednesday morning before
mchenry conceived the idea of select-
ing from all these amateurs a repre-
sentative group composed of those who
had done best and giving them the
grand climax saturday night the last
event of the season this didnt occur
to him until wednesday morning at
eleven oclock but it wasnt ten seconds
later that it occurred to him to double
the prices for that evening

  twenty minutes afterward he thought
of presenting to each one of that final
group an embossed certificate signed by
himself dillingham westervelt and
the leading lady to certify to the world
that the recipient was almost as good
as a regular actor

  at half past eleven he decided to have
a special program with much adver-
tising at ruinous rates and at quar-
ter of twelve he had hired four solicit-
ors and set them to work

  the solicitors were hardly out of the
door before he remembered that there
was a street drop in the second act so
he hired another solicitor and sent him
out to get advertising for signs  the
stage buildings and on a hastily con-
ceived billboard at one-twenty-five he
settled on refreshments and began tele-
phoning for bids for the concession
and as he went in to lunch he deter-
mined that since the program was spe-
cial he might as well charge a quarter
for it

  and so in the early hours of the


the popular magazine

morning after that last smashing suc-
cess mchenry and dillingham and
westervelt sat in peppers room in the
hotel writing long lines of figures on
hotel stationery at length their arith-
metic proved sound and mchenry as
treasurer stated the findings

  leaving out the thousand well give
the athletic association of the high
school-ive just thought of that itll
make a wild hit and we may come back
here next season you know-the ex-
penses were a trifle over nineteen thou-
sand and the profits are a trifle over
thirty its about sixty-five hundred
apiece

  sixty-five hundred said dilling-
ham

  sixty-five hundred said wester-
velt hungrily he looked at mchenry
and at the figures when do i get
mine 

  ill write you a check in the morn-
ing-

  westervelt got up and leaned over
the back of his chair

  well he said now that its over
ill tell you what i think of it you
said something about wanting to do it
again next year in the first place ive
got the option on the theater all by my-
self  and in the second place i wouldnt
play with a couple of bloodhounds like
you again for the whole thirty thou-
sand  of all the inane idiotic asinine
seasons ive ever seen this was the
limit it may have been good business
but it wasnt art im an actor im not
a cut-rate druggist or a soda-fountain
proprietor im through with you ive
lived through ten solid weeks of unadul-
terated by and by ive drunk so much
charged water that i dream im a si-
phon money whats money noth-
ing compared with peace of mind and
i havent had any-there wont be an-
other season for this partnership mr
mchenry you cant get out of our
second contract thank heaven i can
say what i like now and i say right

to your face you-you-you- he

bubbled impotently

  i wouldnt care where you said that
said mchenry

  second contract puzzled dilling-
ham

  on consideration that our manager
wouldnt drink anything stronger than
fizz for ten weeks said mchenry i
made another contract to let him out of
the first one at the end of em you
see pierce our lawyer in new york

made a mistake-

  yes a mistake said westervelt bit-
terly if youll excuse me gentlemen
im going downstairs

  they closed an hour ago explained
pepper imperturbably you see
pierce as i was saying this lawyer
made a mistake when i came to look
over that contract the first night i was
here i found that mr westervelt had
agreed to work for us for ten years at
twenty-five dollars a week so we

made this second agreement- he

perceived the expression on wester-
velts face and pitied him oh come
on he said it didnt do you any
harm and it helped us a lot ill tell
you what ill do ive got a little pri-
vate stock here in a closet-

  mr westervelt sat down as quickly
as he conveniently could

  bring it on he said and ill for-
give you is it any good

  its the best in the world for the

present purpose-

  you cant be too sudden about it
then why you two young idiots have
taken a year out of my life got any
ice 

its cold enough now said pepper
ill mix it up for you in the bathroom
he was busily engaged with the mix-
ing when dillingham came to him and
spoke soberly

  say pepper he said dont you
think its pretty unreasonable to do any-
thing like this-

  this mchenry indicated his ma-
mhenry an dillingham angels



terials its nothing but french vichy
and lemon juice

 but pepper-its a sort of joke of
 course but hell be sore as a hound is
 it worth it

 mchenry squeezed the juice of the
 last lemon into a glass

 its been worth sixty-five hundred

 apiece he said finally besides its
 up to us to be strictly moral in fact
 moraler than that he poured the
 vichy on the lemon juice you know
 what we are dont you

  promoters guessed his partner
good lord no said mchenry

   ill face both success and disaster

   no fate that is mine will i shirk

thrifty america

some persons have been maligning the people of the united states the
average american has been held up to the gaze of all americans as a waste-
ful unprovident person who ought to pattern after the thrifty frenchman
the plodding german or the canny scot and put a penny away now and
then for a rainy day such careless spendthrift habits as the people of the united
states had contracted it was pointed out would develop into a great national
weakness if not corrected soon

    just about the time the preaching along this line was becoming popular among
persons who like to utter awful warnings some indiscreet individual down in
washington gave out the figures showing that the savings-bank deposits in the
united states aggregate 

    this sum is larger than the total not only of any other one nation but bigger
than the combined deposits of the french british austrians italians and jap-
anese in their communal private postal corporate and trustee savings banks

    there are several savings banks in new york city that have deposits in
excess of one hundred million dollars the total number of savings banks in the
country is one thousand nine hundred and seventy-eight the average account is
 and the depositors make up an army of  persons

    thrift why the savings-banks deposits of the united states would pay
the cost of the european war for nearly one hundred days

social and individual efficiency

lawrence f abbott says americans are the most inefficient socially
and the most efficient individually of any people on the face of the earth
to illustrate he says that if you put twelve farmers in a field with a great
imbedded bowlder the twelve will spend the day theorizing and discussing
ways and means of getting the rock out but if you send eleven away and leave the
most energetic of the dozen there with a good yoke of oxen he will snake out
that bowlder within an hour
caught in the net



    we talk a lot about teamwork he says but are opposed to its principle we
make the greatest fire apparatus in the world and possess the greatest individual
firemen and we burn up more millions of property in a year than any other
two civilized nations combined our fire apparatus and our excellent firemen are
not equal to the handicap of our opposition to restrictions and precautionary meas-
ures necessary to prevent fires

    the trouble is he says that we do not care to work together for the good
of all and are opposed to doihg what we are told unless it suits our convenience
what is there in it for me is of more potent appeal to the american than
what is there in it for all the people

    we have ordinances that would promote the general health and the general
good if lived up to by everybody but there are free-born americans who like to
show their absolute independence by breaking such regulations when and where
it suits their pleasure and convenience

    we are great people for making laws but pefer that other persons live up
to them we have a sneaking admiration for some forms of lawbreaking and not
infrequently help in the lawbreaking simply because we like to show our individual
spirit as opposed to the edict of the community at large

    all that mr abbott says is true it also is true that social efficiency comes
only through system and regulation long continued system blunts individuality
maybe with all our crudities we are not much worse than we would be as a mass
socially efficient but lacking in what now is our greatest asset-initiative

old-established business

age is venerated abroad the things that are old be they castles customs
churches or families are revered because they have known so much of
time the critical foreigner is likely to scoff at america because things
here have a newness that is garish

    as a matter of fact our newness especially in our business institutions is
more apparent than real there are scores of establishments that have been in
one family or on one site for more than a century with each succeeding gen-
eration they broaden and flower and grow greater

    in the iron and steel industry two of the most prosperous of the companies
outside the united states steel corporation are more than one hundred and
twenty-five years old they are the mammoth plants of the worthy bros and
the lukens iron  steel co at coatesville pennsylvania one of them
started before the revolutionary war and has been owned all this time by
the descendants of the founder in the more than one hundred and forty years
this business has been conducted the heads of the house who are quakers have
refused to make any implements to be used in warfare no government contract
has ever been accepted except the product has been for use in the pursuits o
peace

    until a few years ago the revere copper company founded by paul revere
the messenger of the revolution was in business

    the oldest bank in the western world-the bank of north america of
philadelphia-stands to-day on the same ground in chestnut street where it
stood when robert morris the banker of the revolution opened its doors for


the popular magazine

business in the days when the continental congress was in session across the
street

    the bank of new york-the next oldest american bank occupies to-day the
same site it did- when it came into being through the charter which was drafted
for it by alexander hamilton

    near by and on the same ground which has been its site for more than a
century is the bank of the manhattan company which aaron burr started as a
rival to the bank of new york

    the honor of being the oldest private bank in the western hemisphere may
go either to maitland coppell  co of new york or alex brown  sons of
baltimore as you desire maitland coppell  co trace back farther but there
is no descendant of maitland the founder now in the firm while the bank of
alex brown  sons has passed down from one generation of the family to
another and now under various names including the original and those of brown
bros brown shipley  co plays an important part in international finance

    the oldest soap concern in america has seen nearly one hundred and twenty-
five years of life and now is managed by five brothers who are the great-great-
grandsons of a man who started with one little soap kettle in one small room of
one small house in dutch street new york

    in adams massachusetts there is the adams south milage cotton  woolen
manufacturing co mill that was started more than one hundred years ago with
 spindles and  looms and to-day with its offspring it boasts of 
spindles and  looms various generations of the plunkett family have owned
the mill and to supply a small portion of the cotton for their spindles the
plunketts of to-day have an -acre plantation in the yazoo delta in mis-

english display but they are none the less proud of age as a hall mark of worth
of distinction and of virtue

the pittsburgh of africa

in the heart of darkest africa a great industrial center is being developed
within the next decade or two steel and zinc copper tin and a multitude of
other products of its mills will be sold in competition with the output of

    america and europe

    the pittsburgh of africa probably will have the name of katanga the
state or district of that name in the eastern part of belgian kongo has vast min-
eral deposits and the coal fields are almost inexhaustible to the north near
lake tanganyika is a section practically as rich as that of katanga lake tan-
ganyika is part of the dividing line between belgian kongo and german east
africa

    at present most of the development in katanga has been devoted to copper

    three furnaces have been erected at the works each having capacity to treat
a charge of about three hundred tons of ore a day four other furnaces have
been ordered the foundations for these new furnaces have been commenced
and it is expected that the plants will be working about the middle of 

    at the star of kongo kambove and luushia mines the three properties
caught in the net



which the etoile du kongo company was working in  an output of eighty-one
thousand tons of smelting ore -was used producing seven thousand two hundred
and forty-five tons of bars containing ninety-five to ninety-six per cent of copper
two batteries of twenty-two ovens each have been working since march 
and have produced three thousand tons a month of good metallurgical coke from
the coal supplied by the wankie collieries limited near victoria falls

    since the commencement of operations fifteen thousand tons of copper have
been produced

    on these properties three thousand hands are employed in the near future
several thousand more will be required owing to the rapid completion of coke
furnaces the opening of new mines and the extension of railways it is estimated
that when the present works are completed and the whole number of industrial
undertakings now projected are under way at least eighteen thousand laborers
will be required a number that it will be impossible to supply from the district
itself arrangements have been made with the portuguese government giving
the tanganyika concessions company the right to recruit a considerable amount
of labor in angola along the line of the benguella railway but it may be neces-
sary to seek still further to obtain an adequate supply and the contracting of
chinese labor has been proposed

    america is furnishing most of the machinery imported into katanga and
it is of the latest and most improved character

    the european war may delay the development of katanga somewhat but it
is destined to play an important part in industrial affairs within the next quarter
of a century the region is so rich that the kongo country may come to be known
more for its minerals than its rubber

    various railroad projects ambitious enough to satisfy even an american
promoter are discussed to connect the katanga country with leopoldville far
down the kongo river and there even is talk of lines north south and east
the eastern one to connect katanga with the cape-to-cairo railroad

the uses of adversity

there is a one-legged man on the vaudeville boards who has surprising
agility he uses a crutch as the substitute for his right leg he travels
across the stage at high speed he leaps upon tables falls off chairs turns
somersaults and displays a muscle control which delights his audience for
the fifteen minutes of his turn and he does it all with a good humor which keeps
the act free from morbidity he is plainly enjoying himself it is as if he
said the loss of a leg is nothing you see for yourself that i am lively
and full of spirit there are plenty of things which a one-legged man can do
until we come to the end of those things we wont grieve very much for what
we dont possess in fact is it any advantage to have two legs dont two
legs keep you rather tied down youre so sure-you have them that you dont
do much with them

tiie chaff of war

dinner that evening in the faded
dining room of the hotel splen-
dide was in the way of being a
doleful affair for the folk from
kewanee aside from captain wood-
house the only persons at table there
woodhouse true to the continental tra-
dition of exclusiveness had isolated
himself against possible approach by
sitting at the table farthest from the
shermans his back presented an un-
compromising denial of fraternity as
for mrs sherman the afternoons visit
to the bazaars had been anything but
a solace emphasizing as it did their
grievous poverty in the midst of a
plenty contemptuous of a mere letter of
credit henry j was wallowing in the
lowest depths of nostalgia he tortured
himself with the reflection that this was
lodge night in kewanee and he would
not be sitting in his chair miss kitty
contemplated with melancholy the dis-
tress of her parents

a tall slender youth with tired eyes

and affecting the blase slouch of the
boulevards appeared in the door and
cast about for a choice of tables him
mr sherman impaled with a glance of
disapproval which suddenly changed to
wondering recognition he dropped his
fork and jumped to his feet

  bless me mother if it isnt willy
kimball from old kewanee sher-
man waved his napkin at the young
man summoning him in the name of
kewanee to come and meet the home
folks the tired eyes lighted percep-
tibly and a lukewarm smile played
about mr kimballs effeminate mouth
as he stepped up to the table

 why mrs sherman-and kitty
and you mr sherman-charmed
he accepted the proffered seat by the
side of kitty receiving their hearty hails
with languid politeness with the sure-
ness of english restraint mr willy
kimball refused to become excited he
was of the type of exotic americans
who try to forget grandpas corn-fed
hogs and grandmas hand-churned but-
ter his speech was of rotten row
and his clothes piccadilly
inside the lines



  terrible business this the youth
fluttered his hands feebly all this har-
rying about and peeping at passports
by every silly officer one meets im
afraid ill have to go over to america
until its all over-on my way now in
fact

  afraid sherman sniffed loudly
and appraised mr kimballs tailoring
with a disapproving eye well willy
it would be too bad if you had to go
back to kewanee after your many years
in paris france now wouldnt it

  kimball turned to the women for
sympathy reserved a compartment
to come down from paris beastly
treatment held up at every city-
other people crowded in my apartment
though id paid to have it alone of
course-soldier chap comes along and
seizes my valet and makes him join the
colors and all that sort-

  huh your father managed to
worry along without a val-lay and he
was respected in kewanee this in
disgust from henry j

  kitty flashed a reproving glance at
her father and deftly turned the expa-
triate into a recounting of his adven-
tures under her unaffected lead the
youth who shuddered inwardly at the
appellation of willy thawed consider-
ably and soon there was an animated
swapping of reminiscences of the great
terror-hours on end before the banks
and express offices dodging of police
impositions scrarhbling for steamer ac-
commodations-all that went to com-
pose the refugee americans great epic
of august 

  sherman took pride in his superior
adventures five times arrested be-
tween berlin and gibraltar and what
i said to that dutchman on the swiss
frontier was enough to make his hair
curl

  tell you what willy you come on
back to kewanee with us and mother
and youll lecture before the thursday
afternoon ladies literary club

sherman boomed with a hearty blow
of the hand between w illys shoulder
blades ill have ed porter announce
it in advance in the daily enterprise
and well have the whole town there to
listen ezra kimballs boy tells thrill-
ing tale of wars alarms thats the
way the headlinesll read in the enter-
prise next week

  the expatriate shivered and tried to
smile

  well let mother do the lecturing
kitty came to his rescue  how to live
in europe  a letter of discredit that
will have all the gossips of kewanee
buzzing mother

  the meal drew to a close happily in
contrast to its beginning mrs sher-
man and her daughter rose to pass out
into the reception room sherman and
kimball lingered

 ah-h willy-

 mr sherman-

  both began in unison each somewhat
furtive and shamefaced

  have you any money the queries
were voiced as one for an instant
confusion then the older man looked
up into the youngers face-a bit flushed
it was-and guffawed

  not a postage stamp willy i
guess were both beggars and if mother
and kitty didnt have five trunks be-
tween them this swiss holdup man who
says hes proprietor of this way-sta-
tion hotel wouldnt trust us for a fried

egg-

  same here admitted kimball im
badly bent

  they cant keep us down-us amer-
icans sherman cheered taking the
youths arm and piloting him out into
the reception room well find a way
out if we have to cable for a warship
to come and get us

 just as sherman- and kimball
emerged from the dining room there
was a diversion out beyond the glass
doors on waterport street a small
cart drew up from its seat jumped a


the popular magazine

young woman in a duster and with a
heavy automobile veil swathed under
her chin to the arab porter who had
bounded out to the street she gave di-
rections for the removal from the cart
of her baggage two heavy suit cases
and two ponderous osier baskets these
latter she was particularly tender of
following them into the hotels reception
room and directing where they should
be put before the desk

the newcomer was jane gerson hil-
debrands buyer at the end of her gaso-
line flight from paris cool capable
self-reliant as on the night she saw the
bastions of the capitals outer forts fade
under the white spikes of the search-
lights jane strode up to the desk to face
the smiling aimer

  is this a fortress or a hotel she
challenged

  a hotel lady a hotel aimer
purred a nice room-yes will the
lady be with us long 

  heaven forbid the lady is going
to be on the first ship leaving for new
york and if there are no ships ill
look over the stock of coal barges you
have in your harbor she seized a pen
and dashed her signature on the regis-
ter the shermans had pricked up their
ears at the newcomers first words now
henry j pressed forward his face
glowing welcome

  an american-a simon-pure citizen
of the united states-i thought so
welcome to the little old rock he
took both the girls hands impulsively
and pumped them mrs sherman
kitty and willy kimball crowded
around and the clatter of voices was
instantaneous by auto from paris
goodness me not a thing to eat
for three days but rye bread from
strassburg to luneville in a fanners
wagon each tried to match the
others story of hardship in a whirl-
wind of ejaculation

  the front doors opened again and
the sergeant and guard who had earlier

carried off fritz the barber entered
again gun butts thumped ominously
jane looked over her shoulder at the
khaki-coated men and confided in the
shermans

i think that mans been following
me ever since i landed from the ferry
i have answered the sergeant
stepping briskly forward and saluting
you are a stranger on the rock you

come here from-

  from paris by motor to the town
across the bay then over here on the
ferry the girl answered promptly
what about it

  your name

jane gerson yes yes it sounds
german i know but thats not my
fault im an american-a red-hot
american too for the past two weeks
the sergeants face was wooden
where are you going

  to new york on the saxonia just
as soon as i can and the british army
cant stop me

  indeed the sergeant permitted
himself a fleeting smile from paris
by motor eh your passports please
i havent any jane retorted with
a shade of defiance they were taken
from me in spain just over the french
border and were not returned

  the sergeant raised his eyebrows in
surprise not unmixed with irony he
pointed to the two big osier baskets de-
manding to know what they contained

 gowns-the last gowns made in
paris before the crash fashions last
gasp i am a buyer of gowns for hil-
debrands store in new york

  ecstatic gurgles of pleasure from
mrs sherman and her daughter greeted
this announcement they pressed about
the baskets and regarded them lovingly

  the sergeant pushed them away and
tried to throw back the covers

  open your baggage-all of it he
commanded snappishly

  jane explaining over her shoulder to
insidb the lines



the women stooped to fumble with the
hasps

  seventy of the darlingest gowns-
the very last paul poiret and paquin
and worth made before they closed
shop and marched away with their regi-
ments you shall see every one of
them

  hurry please my times limited
the sergeant barked

  i should think it would be-youre
so charming jane flung back over her
shoulder and she raised the tops of the
baskets the other women pushed for-
ward with subdued coos

  the sergeant plunged his hand under
a mass of colored fluffiness groped for
a minute and brought forth a long roll
of heavy paper with a fierce mien
he began to unroll the bundle

  and these

  plans hildebrands buyer an-
swered

  plans of what the sergeant
glared

  of gowns silly here-youre
looking at that one upside down this
way now isnt that a perfect dear of
an afternoon gown poiret didnt have
time to finish it poor man see that
lovely basque effect everythings
j noyen age this season you know

  jane with a shrewd sidelong glance
at the flustered sergeant rattled on
bringing gown after gown from the bas-
kets and displaying them to the chorus
of smothered screams of delight from
the feminine part of her audience one
she draped coquettishly from her shoul-
ders and did an exaggerated step before
the smoky mirror over the mantelpiece
to note the effect

  isnt it too bad this soldier person
isnt married so he could appreciate
these beauties she flicked a mis-
chievous eye his way of course he
cant be married or hed recognize the
plan of a gown clean hands there
mister sergeant if youre going to
touch any of these dreams here let

me now look at that musquetaire
sleeve-the effect of the war-military
you know

  the sergeant was thoroughly angry
by this time and he forced the situation
suddenly near tragedy under his fin-
gers a delicate girdle crackled suspi-
ciously

  here-your knife rip this open
theres papers of some sort hidden
here he started to pass the gown to
one of his soldiers jane choked back
a scream

  no no thats crinoline stupid no

papers- she stretched out her

arms appealingly the sergeant humped
his shoulders and put out his hand to
take the opened clasp knife

  a plump doll-faced woman who
possessed an afterglow of prettiness
and a bustling nervous manner flounced
through the doors at this juncture and
burst suddenly into the midst of the
group caught in the imminence of dis-
aster

  whats this-whats this she
caught sight of the filmy creation
draped from the sergeants arm oh
the beauty this in a whisper of ad-
miration

  the last one made by worth jane
was quick to explain noting the ser-
geants confusion in the presence of the
stranger and this officer is going to
rip it open in a search for concealed
papers he takes me for a spy

  surprised blue eyes were turned from
jane to the sergeant the latter shame-
facedly tried to slip the open knife into
his blouse mumbling an excuse the
blue eyes bored him through

  i call that very stupid sergeant
reproved the angel of rescue then to
jane-

  where are you taking all these won-
derful gowns

  to new york im buyer for hil-
debrands and-

  but lady crandall this young
no

the popular magazine

woman has no passports-nothing the
sergeant interposed my duty-

  bother your duty dont you know
a worth gown when you see it now
go away ill be responsible for this
young woman from now on tell your
commanding officer lady crandall has
taken your duty out of your hands
she finished with a quiet assurance and
turned to gloat once more over the
gowns the sergeant led his command
away with evident relief

  lady crandall turned to include all
the refugees in a general introduction
of herself

  i am lady crandall the wife of the
governor general of gibraltar she
said with a warming smile i just
came down to see what i could do for
you poor stranded americans in these
times-

  an american yourself or im a tur-
key sherman pushed his way be-
tween the littered baskets and seized
lady crandalls hands knew it by the
cut of your jib-and-and your way of
doing things im henry j sherman
from kewanee illynoy-my wife and
daughter kitty

  and im from iowa-the red hills
of ole ioway the governors wife
chanted with an orators flourish of the
hands welcome to the rock home
folks

  hands all around and an impromptu
old home week right then and there
lady crandalls attention could not be
long away from the gowns however
she turned back to them eagerly with
jane gerson as her aid she passed them
in rapturous review mrs sherman and
kitty playing an enthusiastic chorus

  a pursy litle man with an air of su-
preme importance-henry reynolds he
was united states consul at gibraltar
-catapulted in from the street while
the gown chatter was at its noisiest he
threw his hands above his head in a
mock attitude of submissiveness before
a highwayman

   s all fixed ladies and gentlemen
he cried with a showmans eloquence
heres lady crandall come to tell you
about it and shes so busy riding her
hobby-gowns and millinery and such
-she has forgotten ill bet dollars to
doughnuts

  credit to whom credit is due mister
consul she rallied im not stealing
anybodys official thunder the consul
wagged a forefinger at her reprovingly
with impatience the refugees waited to
hear the news

  well its this way reynolds began
ive got so tired having all you people
sitting on my doorstep i just had to
make arrangements to ship you on the
saxoma in self-defense saxonias due
here from naples thursday-day after

bonnet-has agreed to go bond for your
passage money all your letters of credit

agents before you leave the dock at
new york and you can settle with the
steamship people right there

  no no dont thank me theres

home the consul waved toward the
governors lady who blushed rosily
under the tumultuous blessings show-
ered on her reynolds ducked out the
door to save his face the shermans
made their good nights and with kim-
ball started toward the stairs

  thursday night before you sail
lady crandall called to them you all

ican dinner with me at government
house remember

  if you have hash-plain hash-and

shouted as addendum to the others
thanks

beamed upon jane-youre coming

inside the lines

iii

saxonias sailing oh no dont be too
ready with your thanks this is pure
selfishness on my part i want you to
help plan my fall clothes there the
secrets out but with all those beau-
tiful gowns surely hildebrand will not
object if you leave the pattern of one
of them in an out-of-the-way little place
like this come on now ill not take
no for an answer well pack up all
these beauties and have you off in no
time

  janes thanks were ignored by the
capable packer who smoothed and
straightened the confections of silk and
satin in the osier hampers lady cran-
dall summoned the porter to lift the
precious freight to the back of her dog-
cart waiting outside aimer perturbed
at the kidnaping of his guest came from
behind the desk

  you will go to your room now he
queried anxiously

  not going to take it now jane an-
swered have an invitation from lady
crandall to visit the state house or
whatever you call it

  but pardon me the room-it was
rented and i fear one nights lodging
is due twenty shillings

  jane elevated her eyebrows but
handed over a bill

  ah no lady french paper-it is
worthless to me only english gold
if the lady pleases aimers smile was
leonine

  but its all ive got just came from

france and-

  then though it gives me the great-
est sorrow i must hold your luggage
until you have the money changed ex-
cuse-

  captain woodhouse who had dallied
long over his dinner for lack of some-
thing else to do came out of the dining
room just then saw a woman in diffi-
culties with the landlord and instinc-
tively stepped forward to offer his serv-
ices

  beg pardon but can i be of any
help

  jane turned the captains heart
gave a great leap and then went cold
frank pleasure followed the first sur-
prise in the girls eyes

 why captain woodhouse-how

jolly-to see you again after-

  she put out her hand with a free
gesture of comradeship

  captain woodhouse did not see the
girls hand he was looking into her
eyes coldly aloofly

  i beg your pardon but arent you
mistaken 

  mistaken  the girl was staring at
him mystified

  im afraid i have not had the pleas-
ure of meeting you he continued
evenly but if i can be of service-

now-

  she shrugged her shoulders and
turned away from him

  a small matter i owe this man
twenty shillings and he will not accept
french paper its all i have
woodhouse took the note from her
ill take it gladly-perfectly good
he took some money from his pocket
and looked at it then to aimer i
say can you split a crown

  change for you in a minute sir-
the tobacco shop down the street ai-
mer pocketed the gold piece and dodged
out of the door

  jane turned and found the deep-set
gray eyes of captain woodhouse fixed
upon her they craved pardon-tolera-
tion of the incident just passed

chapter ix

the importance of room d

  woodhouse hurried to jane gersons
side and began to speak swiftly and ear-
nestly 

  you are from the states

  a shrug was her answer the girls
face was averted and in the defiant
set of her shoulders woodhouse found


the cpocpular magazine

little promise of pardon for the inci-
dent of the minute before he per-
sisted 

  this war means nothing to you-
one side or the other

  i have equal pity for them both
she answered in a low voice

  we are living in dangerous times
he continued earnestly i tell you
frankly were the fact that you and i
had met before to become known here
on the rock the consequences would
be most-inconvenient-for me jane
turned and looked searchingly into his
face something in the tone rather
than the words roused her quick sym-
pathy woodhouse kept on

  i am sorry i had to deny that former
meeting just now-that meeting which
has been with me in such vivid mem-
ory i regret that were you to allude
to it again i would have to deny it
still more emphatically

  im sure i shant mention it again
the girl broke in shortly

  perhaps since it means so much to
me and so little to you-your silence-
perhaps you will do me that favor miss
gerson

  certainly woodhouse could see
that anger still tinged her speech

  may i go further-and ask you to
-promise a shadow of annoyance
creased her brows but she nodded

  that is very good of you he
thanked her shall you be long on the
rock

  no longer than i have to im sail-
ing on the first boat for the states
she answered

 then i am in luck-to-night
woodhouse tried to speak easily though
jane gersons attitude was distant
meeting you again-thats luck

  to judge by what you have just
said it must be instead a great mis-
fortune she retorted with a slow
smile

  that is not fair you know what
i mean dont imagine ive really for-

gotten our first meeting under happier
conditions than these i knew im not
clever-i cant make it sound as i would
-but ive thought a great deal of you
miss gerson-wondering how you were
making it in this great war per-
haps-

  aimer returned at this juncture with
the change which he handed to wood-
house he was followed in by lady
crandall who assured jane her ham-
pers were securely strapped to the dog-
cart jane attempted an introduction

  this gentleman has just done me a
service lady crandall may i pre-
sent-

 so sorry you dont know my
name my clumsiness captain wood-
house the man bridged the danger-
ous gap hurriedly lady crandall ac-
knowledged the introduction with a
gracious smile

 your husband is sir george-

he began

  yes sir george crandall governor

general of the rock and you-

  quite a recent comer transferred
from nile country here report to-
morrow

  all of the new officers have to report
to the governors wife as well lady
crandall rallied with a glance at jane
you must come and see me-and miss
gerson who will be with me until her
boat sails

  woodhouse caught his breath jane
gerson who knew him at the gov-
ernors home but he mastered him-
self in a second and bowed his thanks
lady crandall was moving toward the
door her ward turned and held out
a hand to woodhouse

  so good of you to have straight-
ened out my finances she said with
a smile in which the man hoped he
read full forgiveness for his denial of
a few minutes before if youre ever

in america i hope- he looked up

quickly i hope somebody will be as
nice to you good night
ins id e the lines



 woodhouse and aimer were alone
in the mongrel reception room the
hour was late aimer began sliding
folding wooden shutters across the back
of the street windows woodhouse
lingered over the excuse of a final cig-
arette knowing the moment for his
rapprochement with his fellow wil-
helmstrasse spy wras at hand he was
more distraught than he cared to admit
even to himself the days develop-
ments had been startling first the
stunning encounter with capper there
 the very rock which was to be the
scene of his delicate operations-cap-
per whom he had thought sunk in the
oblivion of some alexandrian wine
shop but who had followed him on the
princess mary the fellow had delib-
erately cast himself into his notice
woodhouse reflected there had been
menace and insolent hint of a power
to harm in his sneering objurgation that
woodhouse should remember his name
against a second meeting capper-
never heard the name in alexandria
eh what could he mean by that if
not that somehow the little ferret had
learned of his visit to the home of
doctor koch and that meant-why
capper in gibraltar was as dangerous
as a coiled cobra

  then the unexpected meeting with
jane gerson the little american he had
mourned as lost in the fury of the war
ah that was a joy not unmixed with
regrets what did she think of him
first he had been forced coldly to deny
the acquaintance which had meant much
to him in moments of recollection then
he had attempted a lame explanation
which explained nothing and must have
left her more mystified than before in
fact he had frankly thrown himself on
the mercy of a girl upon whom he had
not the shadow of claim beyond the
poor equity of a chance friendship-
an incident she might consider as merely
one of a days travel so far as he could
know he had stood before her caught

  b

  in a deceit for on the occasion of that
never-to-be-forgotten ride from calais
to paris he had represented himself as
hurrying back to egypt and here she
found him still out of uniform and in
a hotel in gibraltar

  beyond all this jane gerson was go-
ing to the governors house as a guest
she whom he had forced ever so cava-
lierly into a promise to keep secret her
half knowledge of the double game he
was playing was going to be on the in-
timate ground of association with the
one man in gibraltar who by a crook
of his finger could end suspicion by a
firing squad this breezy little baggage
from new york carried his life bal-

                                                           

anced on the rosy tip of her tongue
she could be careless or she could be
indifferent in either case it would be
bandaged eyes and the click of shells
going home for him

  it was aimer who interrupted wood-
houses troubled train of thought

  captain woodhouse will report for
signal duty on the rock to-morrow i
suppose he insinuated coming down
to where woodhouse was standing be-
fore the fireplace he made a show
of tidying up the scattered magazines
and folders on the table

  report for signal duty the other
echoed coldly how did you know
i was to report for signal duty here
in the press a few weeks ago the
hotel keeper hastily explained your
transfer from the nile country was
announced we poor people here in
gibraltar we have so little to think
about even such small details of

news-

  ah yes quite so woodhouse
tapped back a yawn

your journey here from your sta-
tion on the nile-it was- without in-
cident aimer eyed his guest closely
the latter permitted his eyes to rest on
aimers for a minute before replying
quite woodhouse threw his cig-


the cpocpulacr magazine

arette- in the fireplace and started for
the stairs

  ah most unusual-such a long jour-
ney without incident of any kind in
this time of universal war with all
europe gone mad aimer was twid-
dling the combination of a small safe
set in the wall by the fireplace and his
chatter seemed only incidental to the
absorbing work he had at hand how
will the madness end captain wood-
house what will be the boundary
lines of europes nations in-say


  aimer rose as he said this and turned
to look squarely into the others face
woodhouse met his gaze steadily and
witfiout betraying the slightest emotion

  in -i wonder he mused and
into his speech unconsciously appeared
that throaty intonation of the teutonic
tongue

  dont go yet captain woodhouse
before you retire i want you to sample
some of this brandy he brought out
of the safe a short squat bottle and
glasses see i keep it in the safe so
precious it is drink with me captain
to the monarch you have come to gi-
braltar to serve-to his majesty king
george the fifth

  aimer lifted his glass but wood-
house appeared wrapped in thought his
hand did not go up

  i see you do not drink to that toast
captain

  no-i was thinking-of 

  so quick as a flash aimer caught
him up then perhaps i had better
say drink to the greatest monarch in
europe

  to the greatest monarch in europe
woodhouse lifted his glass and drained
it

  aimer leaned suddenly across the
table and spoke tensely you have-
something maybe-i would like to see
some little relic of alexandria let us
say

 woodhouse swept a quick glance

  around then reached for the pin in his
tie

  a scarab thats all

  in the space of a breath aimer had
seen what lay in the back of the stone
beetle he gripped woodhouses hand
fervently

  yes-yes  they have told
me of your coming a cablegram from
koch only this afternoon said you
would be on the princess mary the
other-the real woodhouse-there will

be no slips he will not-

  he is as good as a dead man for
many months woodhouse interrupted
not a chance of a mistake he
slipped easily into german every-
thing depends on us now herr ai-
mer

  perhaps the fate of our fatherland
aimer replied cleaving to english
woodhouse stepped suddenly away
from the side of the table against
which he had been leaning and his
right hand jerked back to a concealed
holster on his hip his eyes were hot
with suspicion

  you do not answer in german why

not  answer me in german or by-

  ach what need to become ex-
cited aimer drew back hastily and
his tongue speedily switched to ger-
man german is dangerous here on
the rock captain only yesterday they
shot a man against a wall because he
spoke german too well do you won-
der i try to forget our native tongue
woodhouse was mollified and he
smiled apologetically aimer forgave
him out of admiration for his discre-
tion

  no need to suspect me-aimer
they will tell you in berlin how for
twenty years i have served the wil-
helmstrasse but never before such an
opportunity-such an opportunity stu-
pendous woodhouse nodded enthu-
siastic affirmation but to business
 this captain woodhouse some
inside the lines



seven years ago was stationed here 
the rock for just three months

  so i know

  you as woodhouse will be ex-
pected to have some knowledge of the
signal tower to which you will have
access aimer climbed a chair  the
opposite side of the room threw open
the face of the old dutch clock there
and removed from its interior a thin
roll of blue drafting paper he put
it in woodhouses hands here are
a few plans of the interior of the sig-
nal tower-the best i could get you
will study them to-night but give me
your word to burn them before you
sleep

  very good woodhouse slipped the
roll into the breast pocket of his coat
aimer leaned forward in a gust of
excitement and bringing his mouth
close to the others ear whispered
hoarsely

  englands mediterranean fleet-
twenty-two dreadnaughts with cruisers
and destroyers-nearly a half of brit-
ains navy will be here any day hurry-
ing back to guard the channel they
will anchor in the straits our big mo-
ment-it will be here then listen
room d in the signal tower-that is
the room all the switches are there
from room d every mine in the har-
bor can be exploded in ten seconds

  yes but how to get to room d
woodhouse queried

 simple two doors to room d
captain an outer door like any other
an inner door of steel protected by a
combination lock like a vaults door
two mem on the rock have that com-
bination major bishop chief signal
officer he has it in his head the gov-
ernor general of the rock he has it in
his safe

  we can get it out of the safe easier
than from major bishops head
woodhouse put in with a smile

  right we have a friend-in the
governors own house-a man with a

number from the wilhelmstrasse like
you and me at any moment in the
past two months he could have laid a
hand on that combination but we
thought it better to wait until neces-
sity came when the fleet arrives you
will have that combination you will
go with it to room d and after

that-

  the deluge the other finished

  yes-ves our country master of
the sea at last and by the work of
the wilhelmstrasse-despised spies who
arc shot like dogs when theyre caught
but die heroes deaths the hotel pro-
prietor checked himself in the midst
of his rhapsody and came back to more
practical details

  but this afternoon-that man from
alexandria who called you by name
that looked bad-very bad he
knows something

  woodhouse who had been expect-
ing the question and who preferred
not to share an anxiety he felt himself
best fitted to cope with alone turned
the others question aside

  never met him before in my life
to my best recollection my name he
picked up  the princess mary of
course  won a pool one day and he
may have heard some one mention it
simply a drunken brawler who didnt
know what he was doing

  aimer seemed satisfied but raised an-
other point

  but the girl who has just left here
am i to have no explanation of her
what explanation do you want  the
captain demanded curtly

  she recognized you who is she
what is she

  devilish unfortunate woodhouse
admitted we met a few weeks ago
on a train while i was  my way to
egypt you know chatted together-
oh very informally she is a capable
young woman from the states-a
buyer she calls herself but i dont
think we need fear complications from


the cpopuljcr magazine

that score shes bent only on getting
home

  the situation is dangerous urged
aimer wagging his head she is stop-
ping at the governors house any ref-
erence she might make about meeting
you on a train on the continent when
you were supposed to be at wady haifa

on the nile-

  i have her promise she will not men-
tion that meeting to anybody

  ach a womans promise ai-
mers eyes invoked heaven to witness
a futile thing she seemed rather

glad to see you again i-

  really woodhouses eyes lighted
the splendides proprietor was pacing
the floor as fast as his fat legs would
let him something must be done
he muttered over and again he halted
abruptly before woodhouse and
launched a thick forefinger at him like
a torpedo

  you must make love to that girl
woodhouse to keep her on our side
was his ultimatum

  woodhouse regarded him quizzi-
cally leaned forward and whispered
significantly

  im already doing it he said

chapter x

mr capper visits a lady

  turning to consider the never-stale

fortunes of one of fates bean bags-

  mr billy capper ejected from the
hotel splendide took little umbrage at
such treatment it was not an uncom-
mon experience and besides a quiet
triumph which would not be dampened
by trifles filled his soul cheerfully he
pushed through the motley crowd on
waterport street down to the lower
levels of the city by the line wall
where the roosts of sailors and warrens
of quondam adventurers off all the
seven seas made for more congenial
atmosphere than that of the splendides
hollow pretense he chose a hostelry

more commensurate with his slender
purse than aimers though as a mat-
ter of fact the question of paying a
hotel bill was farthest from billy cap-
pers thoughts such formal transac-
tions he avoided whenever feasible
the proprietor of the san roc where
capper took a room had such an evil
eye that his new guest made a mental
note that perhaps he might have to
leave his bag behind when he de-
camped capper abhorred violence-to
his own person

  alone over a glass of thin wine-the
champagne days alas had been too
fleeting-capper took stock of his sit-
uation and conned the developments he
hoped to be the instrument for starting
to begin with finances were wretch-
edly bad and that was a circumstance
so near the ordinary for capper that
he shuddered as he pulled a gold guinea
and a few silver bits from his pocket
and mechanically counted them over
of the three hundred marks louisa-
pretty snake-had given him in the
cafe riche and the expense money he
had received from her the following day
to cover his expedition to alexandria
for the wilhelmstrasse naught but this
paltry residue that second-cabin
ticket on the princess mary had taken
the last big bite from his hoard and
here he was in this black-and-tan town
with a quid and little more between
himself and the old starved-dog life

  but-and capper narrowed his eyes
and sagely wagged his head-thered
be something fat coming when he
got knee to knee with the governor gen-
eral of the rock and told him what
he billy capper knew about the iden-
tity of captain woodhouse newly
transferred to the signal service at gi-
braltar why if there wasnt a cool fifty
pounds or a matter of that as honora-
rium from a generous government billy
capper had missed his guess thats
all

  i say governor of course this is
inside the lines



very handsome of you but i didnt
come to tell what i know for gold im
a loyal englishman and ive done what
i have for the good of the old flag

  quite right mr capper quite right
but you will please accept this little gift
as an inadequate recognition of your
loyalty your name shall be mentioned
in my dispatches-home

  capper rehearsed this hypothetical
dialogue with relish he could even
catch the involuntary gasp of aston-
ishment from the governor when that
responsible officer in his majestys serv-
ice heard the words capper would
whisper to him could see the com-
mander of the rock open a drawer in
his desk and take therefrom a thick
white sheaf of bank notes-count them
then-ah then-the first train for
paris and the delights of paris at war-
time prices

  the little spy anticipated no difficulty
in gaining audience with the governor
before he had been fifteen minutes off
the princess mary he had heard the
name of the present incumbent of gov-
ernment house crandall-sir george
crandall the same who had been in
command of the forts at rangoon back
in  oh yes capper knew him
and he made no doubt that if properly
reminded of a certain bit of work billy
capper had done back in the burmese
city sir george would recall him-and
with every reason for gratefulness to-
morrow-yes before ever sir george
had had his mornings peg capper
would present himself at government
house and tell about that house on
queens terrace at ramleh about the
unconscious british officer who was car-
ried there and hurried thence by night
and the tall well-knit man in confer-
ence with doctor koch who was now
come to be a part of the garrison of
the rock under the stolen name of
woodhouse

  capper had his dinner then strolled
around the town to see the sights and

hear what he could hear listening
was a passion with him

  for the color and the exotic savor
of gibraltar on a hot august night
capper had no eye the knife edge
of a moon slicing the battlements of
the old moorish castle up on the
heights the minor tinkle of a guitar
sounding from a vine-curtained bal-
cony a riffian muleteers singsong re-
view of his fractious beasts degraded
ancestry-not for these incidentals did
the practical mind under the battered
capper bowler have room rather the
scraps of information and gossip passed
from one blue-coated artilleryman off
duty to another over a mug of ale
or the confidence of a sloe-eyed dancer
to the guitar player in a tavern this
was meat for capper carefully he
husbanded his gold piece and judici-
ously he spent his silver for drink he
enjoyed himself in the ascetic spirit of
a monk in a fast believing that the
morrow would bring champagne in
place of the thin wine his pitiful silver
could command

  then of a sudden he caught a
glimpse of louisa-louisa of the wil-
helmstrasse cappers heart skipped
and an involuntary impulse crooked his
fingers into claws

  the girl was just coming out of a
cafe-the only cafe aspiring to parisian
smartness gibraltar boasts her head
was bare under an arm she had
tucked a stack of cigar boxes had
it not been that a steady light from
an overhead arc cut her features out
of the soft shadow with the fineness
of a diamond-pointed tool capper
would have sworn his eyes were play-
ing him tricks but louisas features
were unmistakable whether in the lu-
cullan surroundings of a berlin sum-
mer garden or here on a street in
gibraltar capper had instinctively
crushed himself against the nearest wall
on seeing the girl the crowd had come


the tpopular magazine

between himself and her and she had
not seen him

  all the weasel instinct of the man
came instantly to the fore that second
of recognition and the glint in his eyes
and baring of his teeth were flashed
from brute instinct-the instinct of the
night-prowling meat hunter all the
vicious hate which the soul of billy
capper could distill flooded to his eyes
and made them venomous slinking
dodging covering he followed the girl
with the cigar boxes she entered sev-
eral dance halls offered her wares at
the door of a cheap hotel for more
than an hour capper shadowed her
through the twisting streets of the old
spanish town finally she turned into
a narrow lane climbed flagstone steps
set the width of the lane to a house
under the scarp of a cliff and let her-
self in at the street door capper fol-
lowing to the door as quickly as he
dared found it locked

  the little spy was choking with a lust
to kill his whole body trembled under
the pulse of a murderous passion he
had found louisa-the girl who had
sold him out-and for her private ends
capper made no doubt of that some
day he had hoped to run her down and
with his fingers about her soft throat
to tell her how dangerous it was to
trick billy capper but to have her
flung across his path this way when
anger was still at white heat in him-
this was luck hed see this louisa
and have a litle powwow with her even
if he had to break his way into the
house

  capper felt the doorknob again the
door wouldnt yield he drew back a
bit and looked up at the front of the
house just a dingy black wall with
three unlighted windows set in it irreg-
ularly the roof projected over the
gabled attic like the visor of a cap
beyond the farther corner of the house
was ten feet of garden space and then
the bold rock of the cliff springing up-

ward a low wall bounded the gar-
den  over its top nodded the pale
ghosts of moonflowers and oleanders

  capper was over the wall in a bound
and crouching amid flower clusters lis-
tening for possible alarm none came
and he became bolder skirting a tiny
arbor he skulked to a position in the
rear of the house there a broad patch
of illumination stretched across the gar-
den coming from two french windows
on the lower floor they stood half
open through the thin white stuff hang-
ing behind them capper could see
vaguely the figure of a girl seated be-
fore a dressing mirror with her hands
busy over two heavy ropes of hair
nothing to do but step up on the little
half balcony outside the windows push
through into the room and-have a lit-
tle powwow with louisa

  an unwonted boldness had a grip
on the little spy never a person to
force a face-to-face issue when the
trick could be turned behind some-
bodys back he was nevertheless
driven irresistibly by a furious anger
which took no heed of consequences

  with the light foot of a cat capper
straddled the low rail of the balcony
pushed back one of the partly opened
windows and stepped into louisas
room his eyes registered mechani-
cally the details-a heavy canopied bed
a massive highboy of some dark wood
chairs supporting carelessly flung bits
of wearing apparel but he noted es-
pecially that just as he emerged from
behind one of the loose curtains a white
arm remained poised over a brown
head

  stop where you are billy capper
the girls low-spoken order was as cold
and tense as drawn wire no trace of
shock or surprise was in her voice
she did not turn her head capper was
brought up short as if he felt a noose
about his neck

  slowly the figure seated before the
dressing mirror turned to face him
inside the lines



tumbling hair framed the girls face
partly veiling the yellow-brown eyes
which seemed two spots of metal com-
ing to incandescence under heat her
hands one still holding a comb lay
supinely in her lap

  i admit this is a surprise capper
louisa said letting each word fall
sharply but without emphasis how-
ever it is like you to be-unconven-
tional may i ask what you want this
time-besides money of course

  capper wet his lips and smiled wryly
he had jumped so swiftly to impulse
that he had not prepared himself be-
forehand against the morhent when he
should be face to face with the girl
from the wilhelmstrasse moreover he
had expected to be closer to her-very
close indeed-before the time for words
should come

  i-i saw you to-night and followed
you-here he began lamely

  flattering she laughed shortly

  oh you neednt try to come it over
me with words cappers teeth
showed in a nasty grin as his rage
flared back from the first suppression
of surprise ive come here to have
a settlement for a little affair between
you and me

  blackmail why billy capper
how true to form you run the yel-
low-brown eyes were alight and burning
now have you determined the sum
you want or are you in the open mar-
ket

  capper grinned again and shifted
his weight inadvertently advancing one
foot a little nearer the seated girl as
he did so

  pretty quick with the tongue-as
always he sneered but this time it
dont go louisa you pay differently
this time-pay for selling me out un-
derstand again one foot shifted for-
ward a few inches by the accident of
some slight body movement on the
mans part louisa still sat before her

dressing mirror hands carelessly
crossed on her lap

  selling you out she repeated
evenly oh so you finally did dis-
cover that you were elected to be the
goat  brilliant capper how long be-
fore you made up your mind you had
a grievance

  the girls cool admission goaded the
little mans fury to frenzy his mind
craved for action-for the leap and
the tightening of fingers around that
taunting throat but somehow his body
strangely detached from the fiat of vo-
lition as if it were anothers body
lagged to the command violence had
never been its mission muscles were
slow to accept this new conception of
the mind but the mans feet followed
their crafty intelligence by fractions of
inches they moved forward stealthily

  you wouldnt be here now louisa
coldly went on if you werent for-
tunes bright-eyed boy you were slated
to be taken off the boat at malta and
shot the boat didnt stop at malta
through no fault of ours and so you
arrived at alexandria-and became a
nuisance one of the girls hands
lifted from her lap and lazily played
along the edge of the rosewood stand-
ard which supported the mirror on the
dressing table it stopped at a curi-
ously carved rosette in the rococo scroll-
work cappers suspicious eye noted
the movement he sparred for time-
the time needed by those stealthy feet
to shorten the distance between them-
selves and the girl

  why he hissed why did you give
me a number with the wilhelmstrasse
and send me to alexandria if i was
to be caught and shot at malta thats
what im here to find out

  excellent capper her fingers
were playing with the convolutions of
the carved rosette intelligent cap-
per he comes to a ladys room at
night to find the answer to a simple
question he shall have it he evi-


the cpocpular magazine

dently does not know the method of
the wilhelmstrasse which is to choose
two men for every task to be accom-
plished one-the target we call him
-goes first our friends whose secrets
we seek are allowed to become sus-
picious of him-we even give them a
hint to help them in their suspicion
they seize the target and in time of
war he becomes a real target for a firing
squad as you should have been cap-
per at malta then when our friends
believe they have nipped our move in
the bud follows the second man-who
turns the trick

  capper was still wrestling with that
baffling stubbornness of the body each
word the girl uttered was like vitriol
on his writhing soul his mind willed
murder-willed it with all the strength
of hate but still the springs of his
body were cramped-by what not
cowardice for he was beyond reckon-
ing results certainly not compassion
or any saving virtue of chivalry why
did his eyes constantly stray to that
white hand lifted to allow the fingers
to play with the filigree of wood on
the mirror support

  then you engineered the stealing of
my number-from the hollow under the
handle of my cane-some time between
paris and alexandria he challenged
in a whisper his face thrust forward
between hunched shoulders

  no indeed it was necessary for
you to have-the evidence of your pro-
fession when the english searched you
at malta but the loss of your num-
ber is not news koch in alexandria
has reported of course

  the girl saw cappers foot steal for-
ward again he was not six feet from
her now his wiry body settled itself
ever so slightly for a spring louisa
rose from her chair one hand still rest-
ing  the wooden rosette of the mirror
standard she began to speak in a voice
drained of all emotion

  you followed me here to-night billy

capper imagining in your poor little
soul that you were going to do some-
thing desperate-something really hu-
man and brutal you came in my win-
dow all primed for murder but your
poor little soul all went to water the
instant we faced each other you
couldnt nerve yourself to leap upon
a woman even you cant now

 she smiled upon him-a womans
flaying smile of pity capper writhed
and his features twisted themselves in
a paroxysm of hate

  i have my finger on a bell button
here capper if i press it men will
come in here and kill you without ask-
ing a question now youd better go

  cappers eyes jumped to focus on a
round white nib under one of the girls
fingers there on the mirrors standard
the little ivory button was alive-a sen-
tient thing suddenly allied against him
that inanimate object rather than
louisas words sent fingers of cold fear
to grip his heart a little ivory button
waiting there to trap him he tried
to cover his vanished resolution with
bluster sputtering out in a tense whis-
per

  youre a devil-a devil from hell
louisa but ill get you they shoot
women in war time sir george cran-
dall-i know him-i did a little service
for him once in rangoon hell hear
of you and your wilhelmstrasse tricks
and youll have your pretty back against
a wall with guns at your heart before
to-morrow night remember-before
to-morrow night

  capper was backing toward the open
window behind him the girl still
stood by the mirror her hand lightly
resting where the ivory nib was she
laughed

  very well billy capper it will
be a firing party for two-you and me
together ill make a frank confes-
sion-tell all the information billy cap-
per sold to me for three hundred marks
one night in the cafe riche-the story
inside the lines	

of the anglo-belgian defense arrange-
ments the same billy capper ill say
who sold the lord fisher letters to the
kaiser-a cable to downing street will
confirm that identification inside of two

hours and then-

 and your captain woodhouse-
your cute little wilhelmstrasse cap-
tain capper flung back from the win-
dow pretending not to heed the girls
potent threat i know all about him
and the governorll know too-same
time he hears about you

  good night billy capper louisa
answered with a piquant smile and
au revoir until we meet with our backs
against that wall

  cappers head dropped from view
over the balcony edge there was a
sound of running feet amid the close-
ranked plants in the garden then
silence

  the girl from the wilhelmstrasse
alone in the house save for the bent
old housekeeper asleep in her attic
turned and laid her head-a bit weakly
-against the carved standard where in
a florid rosette showed the ivory tip
of the hinge for the cheval glass

chapter xi

a spy in the signal tower

  government house one of the bae-
deker points of gibraltar stands amid
its gardens on a shelf of the rock about
midway between the alameda and the
signal tower perched on the very spine
of the lions back above it its windows
look out upon the blue bay and over
to the red roofs of algeciras across the
water on spanish territory tourists
gather to peek from a respectful dis-
tance at the mossy front and quaint
ecclesiastic gables of government
house which has a distinction quite
apart from its use as the home of the
governor general once back in the
dim ages of spains glory it was a

monastery one of the oldest in the
southern tip of the peninsula when
the english came their practical sense
took no heed of the protesting ghosts
of the monks but converted the mon-
aster into a home for the military head
of the fortress-a little dreary a shade
more melancholy than the accustomed
manor hall at home but adequate and
livable

  thither on the morning after his
arrival captain woodhouse went to re-
port for duty to major general sir
george crandall governor general
captain woodhouse was in uniform-
neat- service khaki and pith helmet
which became him mightily he ap-
peared to have been molded into the
short-skirted olive-gray jacket it set
on his shoulders with snug ease per-
haps if anything the uniform gave
to his features a shade more than their
wonted sternness to his body just the
least addition of an indefinable alert-
ness of nervous acuteness it was nine
oclock and captain woodhouse knew
it was necessary for him to pay his
duty call upon sir george before the
eleven oclock assembly

  as the captain emerged from the
straggling end of waterport street and
strode through the flowered paths of
the alameda he did not happen to see
a figure which dodged behind a che-
vaux-de-frise of spanish bayonet upon
his approach billy capper who had
been pacing the gardens for more than
an hour fear battling with the preda-
tory impulse which urged him to gov-
ernment house watched captain wood-
house pass and his eyes narrowed into
a queer twinkle of oblique humor so
captain woodhouse had begun to play
the game-going to report to the gov-
ernor eh the pale soul of mr cap-
per glowed with a faint flicker of ad-
miration for this cool bravery far be-
yond its capacity to practice capper
waited a safe time then followed chose
a position outside government house


the popular magazine

 from which he could see the main en-
 trance and waited

    a tall thin east indian with a nar-
 row ascetic face under his closely
 wound white turban and wearing a na-
 tive livery of thesame spotless white
 answered the captains summons on the
 heavy knocker he accepted the vis-
 itors card showed him into a dim hall-
 way hung with faded arras and coats
 of chain mail the indian jaimihr
 khan gave captain woodhouse a start
 when he returned to say the governor
 would receive him in his office the
 man had a tread like a cats absolutely
 noiseless he moved through the half
 light of the hall like a white wraith
 his english was spoken precisely and
 with a curious mechanical intonation

   jaimihr khan threw back heavy
 double doors and announced cap-tain
 wood-house he had the doors shut
 noiselessly almost before the visitor was
 through them

   a tall heavy-set man with graying
 hair and mustache rose from a broad
 desk at the right of a large room and
 advanced with hand outstretched in cor-
 dial welcome

   captain woodhouse of the signal
 service welcome to the rock captain
 need you here glad youve come
 woodhouse studied the face of his
 superior in a swift glance as he shook
 hands a broad full face it was
 kindly intelligent perhaps not as alert
 as to the set of eyes and mouth as
 it had been in younger days when the
 stripes of service were still to be won
 general sir george crandall gave the
 impression of a man content to rest on
 his honors though scrupulously atten-
 tive to the routine of his position he
 motioned the younger man to draw a
 chair up to the desk

   in yesterday on the princess mary
 i presume captain 

yes general didnt report to you
 upon arrival because i thought it would

be quite tea time and i didnt want to
disturb-

  right general crandall tipped
back in his swivel chair and appraised
his new officer with satisfaction
everything quiet on the upper nile
germans not tinkering with the mullah
yet to start insurrection or anything like
that

  right as a trivet sir woodhouse
answered promptly of course were
anticipating some such move by the
enemy-agents working in from ery-
threa-holy war of a sort perhaps but
i think our people have things well in
hand

  and at wady haifa your former
commander- the general hesi-
tated

  major bronson-webb sir wood-
house was quick to supply but not with-
out a sharp glance at the older man

 yes-yes bronson-webb-knew
him in rangoon in the late nineties-
mighty decent chap and a good execu-
tive hes standing the sun i war-
rant

  captain woodhouse accepted the cig-
arette from the generals extended case

  no complaint from him at least
general crandall we all get pretty
well baked at wady i take it

  the governor laughed and tapped a
bell on his desk jaimihr khan was
instantly materialized between the dou-
ble doors

  my orderly jaimihr general cran-
dall ordered and the doors were shut
once more the general stretched a
hand across the desk

  your papers please captain ill
receipt your order of transfer and
youll be a member of our garrison
forthwith

  captain woodhouse brought a thin
sheaf of folded papers from his breast
pocket and passed it to his superior
he kept his eyes steadily on the gen-
erals face as he scanned them

transfer aloud running his eyes rap-
idly down the lines of the form right
now captain when my orderly
comes-

  a subaltern entered and saluted

  this is captain woodhouse gen-
era crandall indicated woodhouse
who had risen kindly conduct him
to major bishop who will assign him
to quarters captain woodhouse we
-lady crandall and i-will expect you
at government house soon to make
your bow over the teacup one of
lady crandalls inflexible rules for new
recruits you know good day sir

  woodhouse out in the free air again
drew in a long breath and braced back
his shoulders he accompanied the
subaltern over the trails on the rock
to the quarters of major bishop chief
signal officer under whom he was to
be junior in command but one regret
marked his first visit to government
house-he had not caught even a
glimpse of the little person calling her-
self jane gerson buyer

  but he had missed by a narrow mar-
gin piloted by lady crandall jane
had left the vaulted breakfast room for
the larger and lighter library room
which sir george had converted to the
purpose of an office this room was
a sort of holy of holies with lady cran-
dall to be invaded if the presiding
genius could be caught napping or lulled
to complaisance this morning she had
the important necessity of unobstructed
light-not a general commodity about
government house-to urge in defense
of profanation for her guest carried
under her arm a sheaf of plans-by
such sterling architects of womens fan-
cies as worth and doeuillet and the
imp of envy would not allow the gov-
ernors wife to have peace until she
had devoured every pattern she
paused in mock horror at the thresh-
old of her husbands sanctum

  but george dear you should be
out by this time you know lady cran-
dall expostulated miss gerson and i
have something-oh tremendously im-
portant to do here she made a sly
gesture of concealing the bundle of
stiff drawing paper she carried gen-
eral crandall who had risen at the ar-
rival of the two invaders made a show
at capturing the plans his wife held
behind her back jane bubbled laugh-
ter at the spectacle of so exalted a
military lion at play the general pos-
sessed himself of the roll drew a curled
scroll from it and gravely studied it

  miss gerson he said with delib-
eration this looks to me like a plan
of battery b i am surprised that you
should violate the hospitality of gov-
ernment house by doing spy work from
its bedroom windows

  foolish youve got that upside
down for one thing lady crandall
chided and beside its only a chart
of what the lady of government house
hopes soon to wear if she can get the
goods from holbeins on regent
street

  you see general crandall im at-
tacking government house at its weak-
est point jane laughed been here
less than twelve hours and already the
most important member of the garrison
has surrendered

  the american sahib reynolds
chanted jaimihr khan from the double
doors and almost at once the breezy
consul burst into the room he saluted
all three with an expansive gesture of
the hands

  morning governor-morning lady
crandall and same to you miss ger-
son dear dear this is going to be
a bad day for me and its just started
the little man was wound up like a
sidewalk toy and he ran on without
stopping

  general sherman might have got
some real force into his remark about
war if hed had a job like mine miss


the popular magazine

gerson-news heard from the sax-
onia be in harbor some time to-mor-
row and leave at six sharp following
morning jane clapped her hands
ive wired for accommodations for all
of you-just got the answer rotten
accommodations but-thank heaven-
i wont be able to hear what you say
about me when youre at sea
anything will do jane broke in
im not particular i want to sail-
thats all

  the consul looked flustered

  urn-thats what i came to see you
about general crandall he jerked
his head around toward the governor
with a birdlike pertness what are
you going to do with this young lady
sir jane waited the answer breath-
lessly

  why-um-really as far as were
concerned sir george answered
slowly wed be glad to have her stop
here indefinitely dont you agree
helen

 of course but-

  its this way the consul interrupted
lady crandall ive arranged to get
miss gerson aboard provided of
course you approve

  you havent got a cable through re-
garding her the general asked her
passports-lost-lot of red tape of
course

  not a line from paris even rey-
nolds answered miss gerson says the
ambassador could vouch for her
and-

  indeed he could jane started im-
pulsively toward the general it was
his wife arranged my motor for me
and advanced me money

  general crandall looked down into
her eager face indulgently

  you really are very anxious to sail
miss gerson

  general crandall im not very
good at these please-spare-my-lover
speeches the girl began her lips trem-
ulous but it means a lot to me-to

go my job my career ive fought my
way this far and here i am-and theres
the sea out there if i cant step aboard
the saxonia friday morning it-it will
break my heart

  gibraltars master honed his chin
thoughtfully for a minute

  um-im sure i dont want to break
anybodys heart-not at my age miss
i see no good reason why i should
not let you go if nothing happens mean-
while to make me change my mind
he beamed good humor on her

  bless you generalv she cried hil-
debrands will mention you in its ad-
vertisements

  heaven forbid general crandall
cried in real perturbation

  jane turned to lady crandall and
took both her hands

  come to my room she urged with
an air of mystery you know that
doeuillet evening gown-the one in
blue its yours lady crandall id
give another to the general if hed

wear it now one fitting and- her

voice was drowned by lady crandalls
you dear

  be at the dock at five a m friday
to see you and the others off miss
gerson reynolds called after her
must go now-morning crowd of
busted citizens waiting at the consulate
to be fed ta-ta reynolds collided
with jaimihr khan at the double doors

  a young man who wishes to see
you general sahib he will give no
name but he says a promise you made
to see him-by telephone an hour ago
show mr reynolds out jaimihr
the general ordered then you may
bring the young man in

  mr billy capper who had in truth
telephoned to government house and
secured the privilege of an interview
even before the arrival of woodhouse
to report and had paced the paths of
the alameda since blowing hot and cold
on his resolutions followed the soft-
footed indian into the presence of gen-
inside the lines



eral crandall the little spy was near
a state of nervous breakdown fol-
lowing the surprising and unexpected
collapse of his plan to do a murder he
had spent a wakeful and brandy-punc-
tuated night his brain on the rack his
desire to play informer heightened now
a hundredfold by the flaying tongue of
louisa was almost balanced by his fears
of resultant consequences cupidity
the old instinct for preying drove him
to impart to the governor general of
gibraltar information which he hoped
would be worth its weight in gold
louisas promise of a party a deux
before a firing squad which he knew in
his heart she would be capable of ar-
ranging in a desperate moment halted
him after screwing up his courage
to the point of telephoning for an ap-
pointment capper had wallowed in
fear he dared not stay away from
government house then for fear of
arousing suspicion equally he dared
not involve the girl from the wilhelm-
strasse lest he find himself tangled in
his own mesh

  at the desperate moment of his in-
troduction to general crandall capper
determined to play it safe and see how
the chips fell his heart quailed as
he heard the doors shut behind him

  awfully good of you to see me
he babbled as he stood before the desk
turning his hat brim through his fingers
like a prayer wheel

  general crandall bade him be seated
i havent forgotten you did me a serv-
ice in burma he added

  oh yes-of course capper man-
aged to answer but that was my job
i got paid for that

  youre not with the brussels secret-
service people any longer then

  the question hit capper hard his
fingers fluttered to his lips

  no general they-er-let me go
suppose you heard that-and a lot of
other things about me that i was a
rotter-that i drank-

  what i heard was not altogether
complimentary the other answered ju-
diciously i trust it was untrue
cappers embarrassment increased
well to tell the truth general
crandall-ah-i did go to pieces for a
time ive been playing a pretty short
string for the past two years but-
he broke off his whine in a sudden ac-
cession of passion-they cant keep me
down much longer im going to show
em

  general crandall looked his surprise
general im an englishman you
know that i may be down and out
and my old friends may not know me
when we meet-but im english and
im loyal capper was getting a grip
on himself he thought the patriotic
line a safe one to play with the com-
mander of a fortress

  yes-yes i dont question that im
sure the general grunted and he be-
gan to riffle some papers on his desk
petulantly

  capper pressed home his point i
just want you to keep that in mind
general while i talk just remember
im english-and loyal

  the governor nodded impatiently
capper leaned far over the desk and
began in an eager whisper

  general remember cook-that chap
in rangoon-the polo player the
other looked blank havent forgotten
him general how he lived in bur-
ma two years mingling with the eng-
lish until one day somebody discovered
his name was koch and that he was
a mighty unhealthy chap to have about

the fortifications surely-

  yes i remember him now but

what-

  there was hollister too you
played billiards in your club with hol-
lister i fancy thought him all right
too-until a couple of secret-service
men walked into the club one day and
clapped handcuffs on him remember
that general 


the popular magazine

  the commander exclaimed snappishly
that he could not see his visitors drift

  im just refreshing your memory
general capper hastened to reassure
just reminding you that there isnt
much differencee between a german and
an englishman after all-if the ger-
man wants to play the englishman and
knows his book he can fool a lot of
us

  granted but i dont see what all

this has tb do with-

 listen general capper was
trembling in his eagerness im just
in from alexandria-came on the prin-
cess mary there was an englishman
aboard bound for gib name was cap-
tain woodhouse of the signal service
quite right what of that gen-
eral crandall looked up suspiciously

  have you seen captain woodhouse
general 

  not a half hour ago he called to
report

  seemed all right to you-this wood-
house capper eyed the others face
narrowly

  of course why not

  remember cook general remem-
ber hollister capper warned

  general crandall exploded irritably
what the devil do you mean what
are you driving at man

  the little spy leaped to his feet in
his excitement and thrust his weasel
face far across the desk

  what do i mean  mean this chap
who calls himself woodhouse isnt
woodhouse at all hes a german spy
-from the wilhelmstrasse-with a
number from the wilhelmstrasse hes
on the rock to do a spys work
pshaw why did brussels let you
go general crandall tipped back in
his seat and cast an amused glance at
the flushed face before him

  capper shook his head doggedly
im not drunk general crandall im
so broke i couldnt get drunk if i
would so help me im telling gods

truth i got it straight- capper

checked his tumult of words and did
some rapid thinking how much did
he dare reveal in alexandria gen-
eral-got it there-from the inside sir
koch is the head of the wilhelmstrasse
crowd there-the same cook you knew
in rangoon he engineered the trick
the wildest dreams of the wilhelm-
strasse have come true theyve got
a man in your signal tower general-
in your signal tower

  general crandall in whom incredulity
was beginning to give way to the first
faint glimmerings of conviction as to
the possibility of truth in the informers
tale rallied himself nevertheless to com-
bat an aspersion cast upon a british
officer

  suppose the germans have a spy in
my signal tower or anywhere here
he began argumentatively suppose
they learn every nook and corner of
the rock-have the caliber and range
of every gun in our defense they
couldnt capture gibraltar in a thou-
sand years

  i dont know what they want cap-
per returned with the injured air of a
man whose worth fails of recognition
i only came here to warn you that your
captain woodhouse is taking orders
from berlin

 come-come man give me some
proof to back up this cock-and-bull
story general crandall snapped he
had risen and was pacing nervously
back and forward

  capper was secretly elated at this
sign that his story had struck home
he stilled the fluttering of his hands
by an effort and tried to bring his voice
to the normal

  here it is general-all ive got of
the story the real woodhouse comes
down from somewhere up the nile-i
dont know where-and puts up for the
night in alexandria to wait for the
princess mary no friends in the
town you know nowhere to visit
inside the lines



three wilhelmstrasse men in alexan-
dria headed by that clever devil cook
or koch who calls himself a doctor
now somehow they get hold of the
real woodhouse and do for him-what
i dont know-probably kill the poor
devil

  general i saw with my own eyes
an unconscious british officer being car-
ried away from kochs house in ram-
leh in an automobile-two men with
him capper fixed the governor with
a lean index finger dramatically and
i saw the man you just this morning
received as captain woodhouse leave
doctor kochs house five minutes after
that poor devil-the real woodhouse-
had been carried off thats the reason
i took the same boat with him to gibral-
tar general crandall-because im
loyal and it was my duty to warn you
incredible

  one thing more general capper
was sorely tempted but for the minute
his wholesome fear of consequences
curbed his tongue woodhouse isnt
working alone on the rock you can
be sure of that hes got friends to
help him turn whatever trick hes after
-maybe in this very house theyre
clever people you can mark that down
on your slate-

  ridiculous the keeper of the
rock was fighting not to believe now
why i tell you if they had a hundred
of their spies inside the lines-if they
knew the rock as well as i do they
could never take it 

  capper rose wearily the air of a mis-
understood man on him

  perhaps they arent trying to cap-
ture it i know nothing about that
well-ive done my duty-as one eng-
lishman to another i hope ive told
you in time ill be going now

 general crandall swung on him
sharply where are you going he
demanded

  capper shrugged his shoulders hope-
lessly now was the minute hed been

counting on-the peeling of crackling
notes from a fat bundle the handsome
words of appreciation surely general
crandall was ripe

  well general frankly-im broke
havent a shilling to bless myself with

i thought perhaps- capper shot

a keen glance at the older mans face
which was partly turned from him the
general appeared to be pondering he
turned abruptly on the spy

  a few drinks and you might talk
he challenged

  capper grinned deprecatively i
dont know general-i might he mur-
mured ive been away from the drink

so long that-

  where do you want to go  general
crandall cut him off of course you
dont want to stay here indefinitely
well-if i had a bit of money-they
tell me everybodys oroke in paris
millionaires-and everybody you know
you can get a room at the ritz for
the asking that would be heaven for
me-if i had something in my pocket
you want to go to paris eh gen-
eral crandall stepped closer to capper
and his eyes narrowed in scorn

  if it could be arranged yes gen-
eral capper was spinning the brim
of his bowler between nervous fingers
he did not dare meet the others glance

  demniit capper you come here
to blackmail me ive met your kind
before i know how to deal with your
ilk 

  so help me general i came here
to tell you the truth i want to go
to paris-or anywhere away from here
ill admit that but that had nothing
to do with my coming all the way here
from alexandria-spending my last
guinea on a steamer ticket-to warn you
of your danger im an englishman
and-loyal capper was pleading
now all hope of reward had sped
and the vision of a cell with subsequent
investigations into his own record ap-


the vovulacr magazine

palled him general crandall sat down
at his desk and began to write

  i dont know-at any rate i cant
have you talking around here youre
going to paris

  capper dropped his hat at a tap
of the bell jaimihr khan appeared at
the doors so suddenly that one might
have said he was right behind them
all the time general crandall directed
that his orderly be summoned when
the subaltern appeared the general
handed him a sealed note

  orderly turn this gentleman over
to sergeant crosby at once he com-
manded and give the sergeant this
note then to capper you will
cross to algeciras where you will be
put on a train for madrid you will
have a ticket for paris and twenty shil-
lings for expense en route you will
be allowed to talk to no one alone be-
fore you leave gibraltar and under no
circumstances will you be allowed to
return-not while  am governor gen-
eral at least

  capper his face alight with new-
found joy turned to pass out with the
orderly he paused at the doorway to
frame a speech of thanks but general
crandalls back was toward him
paris he sighed in rapture and the
doors closed behind him

chapter xii

  a neutral asserts her rights

  do you know my dear cynthia
maxwell is simply going to die with
envy when she sees me in this

  the plump little mistress of govern-
ment house standing before a full-
length mirror in her boudoir surveyed
herself with intense satisfaction her
arms and neck burst startlingly from
the clinging sheath of the incomparable
doeuillet gown which was jane ger-
sons douceur for official protection in
the flood of morning light pouring
through the mullioned windows lady

crandall seemed a pink and white-and
somewhat florid-lily in bloom out of
time hildebrands buyer on her
knees and with deft fingers busy with
the soft folds of the skirt answered
through a mouthful of pins

  poor cynthia my heart goes out to
her

  oh it neednt lady crandall an-
swered with a tilting of her strictly
iowa style nose the maxwell per-
son has made me bleed more than once
here on the rock with the gowns a
fond mamma sends her from paris
but honestly isnt this a bit low for a
staid middle-aged person like myself
im afraid ill have trouble getting my
precious doeuillet past the censor
lady crandall plumed herself with
secret joy

  jane looked up puzzled

  oh thats old lady porter-a per-
fect dragon the generals wife rattled
on poor old dear she thinks the
lord put her on the rock for a pur-
pose her own collars get higher and
higher i believe if she ever was pre-
sented at court shed emulate the old
scotch lady who followed the law of
decollete but preserved her self-respect
by wearing a red flannel chest protec-
tor you must meet her

  im afraid i wont have time to get
a look at your dragon jane returned
with a little laugh all happiness now
that sir george has promised me i can

sail on the saxonia friday-

 you really must- the envious

eyes of lady crandall fell upon the
pile of plans-potent delphic mysteries
to charm the heart of woman-which
lay scattered about on the floor

  jane sat back on her heels and sur-
veyed the melting folds of satin with
an artists eye

  if you only knew-what it means
to me to get back with my baskets full
of french beauties why when i
screwed up my courage two months ago
to go to old hildebrand and ask him
inside the lines



to send me abroad as his buyer-id
been studying drawing and french at
nights for three years in preparation
you see-he roared like the dear old
lion he is and said i was too young
but i cooed and pleaded and at last
he said i could come-on trial and

  hell pur like a pussycat when you
get back lady crandall put in with
a pat on the brown head at her knees

 maybe if i can slip into new
york with my little baskets while all
the other buyers are still over here
cabling tearfully for money to get home
or asking their firms to send a warship
to fetch them-why i guess the pen-
nants mine all right

  the eternal feminine so strong in
iowas transplanted stock prompted a
mischievous question

  then you wont be leaving some-
body behind when you sail-somebody
who seemed awfully nice and-foreigny
and all that all our american girls
find the moonlight over on this side
infectious witness me-a finishing
trip abroad after school days-and see
where ive finished-on a rock lady
crandall bubbled laughter a shrewd
downward sweep of her eye was just
in time to catch a flush mounting to
janes cheeks

  well a mysterious stranger has
crossed my path jane admitted he
was very nice but mysterious

  oh a delighted gurgle from the
older woman tell me all about it-
a secret for these ancient walls to hear
jane was about to reply when second
thought checked her tongue before
her flashed that strange meeting with
captain woodhouse the night before-
his denial of their former meeting fol-
lowed by his curious insistence upon
her keeping faith with him by not re-
vealing the fact of their acquaintance
she had promised-why she had prom-
ised she could no more divine than the
reason for his asking but a promise it
b

was that she would not betray his con-
fidence more than once since that min-
ute in the reception room of the hotel
splendide jane gerson had reviewed
the whole baffling circumstance in her
mind and a growing resentment at this
strangers demand as well as at her
own compliance in agreeing to it was
rising in her heart still this captain
woodhouse was different and-this
jane sensed without effort to analyze-
the mystery which he threw about him-
self but served to set him apart from
the common run of men she evaded
lady crandalls probing with a shrug
of the shoulders

its a secret which i myself do not
know lady crandall-and never will
back to the oerweening lure of the
gown the flitting fancy of the generals
lady betook itself

   you-dont think this is a shade too
young for me miss gerson anxiety
pleaded to be quashed

  nonsense jane laughed

but im  chicken my dear if
you would look me up in our family

bible back in davenport youdlind-

   people dont believe everything they
read in the bible any more jane as-
sured her your record and jonahs
would both be open to doubt

  youre very comforting lady
crandall beamed her maid knocked
and entered upon the ladys crisp
come

   the general wishes to see you lady
crandall in the library

   tell the general im in the midst of

trying on- lady crandall began

then thought better of her excuse she
dropped the shimmering gown from her
shoulders and slipped into a kimono

  some stuffy plan for entertaining
somebody or other my dear-this to
jane the real burden of being gov-
ernor general of the rock falls on the
generals wife just slip into your bon-
net and when im back well take that
little stroll through the alameda ive


the cpocpulacr magazine

promised you for this morning she
clutched her kimono about her and
whisked out of the room

  general crandall just rid of the du-
bious pleasure of billy cappers com-
pany was pacing the floor of the library
office thoughtfully he looked up with
a smile at his wifes entrance

  helen i want you to do something
for me he said

  certainly dear lady crandall was
not an unpleasing picture of ripe beauty
to look upon in the soft drape of the
japanese robe even in his worry gen-
eral crandall found himself intrigued
for the minute

  theres a new chap in the signal
service-just in from egypt-names
woodhouse i wish you would invite
him to tea my dear

  of course any day

  this afternoon if you please
helen the general followed

  his wife looked slightly puzzled
this afternoon but george dear
isnt that-arent you-ah-rushing this
young man to have him up to gov-
ernment house so soon after his ar-
rival  she suddenly remembered
something which caused her to reverse
herself besides ive asked him to
dinner-the dinner im to give the
americans to-morrow night before
they sail

  general crandall looked his surprise
you didnt tell me that i didnt
know you had met him

  just happened to lady crandall
cut in hastily met him at the hotel
splendide last night when i brought
miss gerson home with me

  what was woodhouse doing at the
splendide the general asked suspi-
ciously

  why spending the night you fool-
ish boy just off the princess mary
he was i believe he did miss gerson
some sort of a service-and i met him
in that way-quite informally

  did miss gerson-a service-hum

  oh a trifling thing it seemed she
had only french money and that cau-
tious aimer fellow wouldnt accept it
captain woodhouse gave her english
gold for it-to pay her bill but

why-

  has miss gerson seen him since
general crandall asked sharply

  why george dear how could she
we havent been up from the breakfast
table an hour

  woodhouse was here less than an
hour ago to pay his duty call and re-
port he explained i thought per-
haps he might have met our guest
somewhere in the garden as he was com-
ing or going

  he did send her some lovely roses
lady crandall brightened at this to
her patent inception of a romance she
doted on romances they were in
miss gersons room before she was
down to breakfast

  roses eh and they met infor-
mally at the splendide only last night
suspicion was weighting the generals
words isnt that a bit sudden i
say do you think miss gerson and
this captain woodhouse had met some-
where before last night

  i hardly think so-she on her first
trip to the continent and he coming

from egypt but-

  no matter i want him here to tea
this afternoon the general dis-
missed the subject and turned to his
desk his ladys curiosity would not
be so lightly turned away

  all these questions-arent they
rather absurd is anything wrong
she ran up to him andlaid her hands
on his shoulders

  of course not dear he kissed her
lightly on the brow now run along
and play with that new gown miss ger-
son gave you i imagine thats the
most important thing on the rock to-
day

  lady crandall gave her soldier hus-
band a peck on each cheek and skipped
inside the lines



back to her room when he was alone
again general crandall resumed his
restless pacing resolution suddenly
crystallized and he stepped to the desk
phone he called a number

  that you bishop    general
crandall speaking    bishop you
were here on the rock seven years ago 

   good    pretty good memory
for names and faces eh    right
 i want you to come to govern-
ment house for tea at five this after-
noon    but run over for a little
talk with me some time earlier-an hour
from now say rather important   
youll be here    thank you

  general crandall sat at his desk and
tried to bring himself down to the rou-
tine crying from accumulated papers
there but the canker billy capper
had implanted in his mind would not
give him peace major general cran-
dall was a man cast in the stolid british
mold years of army discipline and tra-
dition of the service had given to his
conservatism a hard grain in common
with most of those in high command
he held to the belief that nothing ex-
isted-nothing could exist-which was
not down in the regulations of the war
office made and provided for up-
ward of twenty-five years he had played
the hard game of the service-in egypt
in burma on the broiling rocks of
aden and here at last on the key to
the mediterranean during all those
years he had faithfully pursued his duty
had stowed away in his mind the wis-
dom disseminated in blue-bound books
by that corporate paragon of knowl-
edge at home the war office but
never had he read in anything but
fluffy fiction of a place or a thing called
the wilhelmstrasse reputed by the
scriveners to be the darkest closet and
the most potent of all the secret cham-
bers of diplomacy the regulations
made no mention of a wilhelmstrasse
even though they provided the brand of
pipe clay which should brighten mens

pith helmets and stipulated to the ounce
an emergency ration therefore to the
official military mind at least the wil-
helmstrasse was nonexistent

  but here comes a beach comber a
miserable jackal from the back alleys
of society and warns the govenor gen-
eral of the rock that he has a man
from the wilhelmstrasse-a spy bent
on some unfathomable mission-in his
very forces on the rock he says that
an agent of the enemy has dared mas-
querade as a british officer in order to
gain admission inside the lines of eu-
ropes most impregnable fortress eng-
lands precious stronghold there to do
mischief

  general crandalls tremendous re-
sponsibility would not permit him to
ignore such a warning coming even
from so low a source yet the man
found himself groping blindly in the
dark before the dilemma presented he
had no foot rule of precept or experi-
ence to guide him

   his fruitless searching for a prop in
emergency was broken by the appear-
ance of jane gerson in the door open-
ing from lady crandalls rooms to the
right of the library the girl was
dressed for the out-of-doors in her
arms was a fragrant bunch of blood-
red roses spraying out from the top
of a bronze bowl the girl hesitated
and drew back in confusion at seeing
the room occupied she seemed eager
to escape undetected but general
crandall smilingly checked her flight

  i-i thought you would be out
jane stammered and-

  and the posies- the general in-
terrupted

  were for you to enjoy when you
should come back she smiled easily
into the mans eyes theyll look so
much prettier here than in my room

  very good of you im sure gen-
eral crandall stepped up to the rich
cluster of buds and sniffed critically
without looking at the girl he con-


the vovulatr magazine

tinned it appears to me as though
you had already made a conquest on the
rock one doesnt pick these from the
cliffs you know

  i should hardly call it a conquest
jane answered with a sprightly toss of
her head

  but a young man sent you these
flowers come-confess the gen-
erals tone was bantering but his eyes
did not leave the piquant face under
the chic summer straw hat that shaded
it

 surely one of your own men-
captain woodhouse of the signal serv-
ice jane was rearranging the stems
in the bowl apparently ready to accept
what was on the surface of the gen-
erals rallying

 woodhouse eh youve known
him for a long time i take it

  since last night general and yet
some people say englishmen are slow
she laughed gayly and turned to face
him his voice took on a subtle quality
of polite insistence

  surely you met him somewhere be-
fore gibraltar

  how could i when this is the first
time captain woodhouse has been out
of egypt for years

  who told you that the general
was quick to catch her up the girl
felt a swift stab of fear on the in-
stant she realized that here was some-
body attempting to drive into the mys-
tery which she herself could not un-
derstand but which she had pledged
herself to keep inviolate her voice
fluttered in her throat as she answered
why he did himself general

  he did eh gave you a bit of his
history  first meeting confiding
chap what but you miss gerson-
youve been to egypt you say 

  no general

  jane was beginning to find this cross-
examination distinctly painful she
felt that already her pledge so glibly
given at captain woodhouses insist-

ence was involving her in a situation
the significance of which might prove
menacing to herself-and one other
she could sense the beginnings of a
strain between herself and this genial
elderly gentleman her host

 do you know miss gerson-he
was speaking slowly and soberly now-
i believe you and captain woodhouse
have met before

  youre at liberty to think anything
you like general-the truth or other-
wise her answer though given smil-
ingly had a sting behind it

  im not going to think much longer
im going to know he clapped his
lips shut over the last word with a
smack of authority

  are you really general crandall
the girls eyes hardened just percep-
tibly he took a turn of the room and
paused facing her the situation
pleased him no more than it did his
breezy guest but he knew his duty and
doggedly pursued it

  come-come miss gerson i be-
lieve youre straightforward and sincere
or i wouldnt be wasting my time this
way ill be the same with you this
is a time of war you understand all
that implies i hope a serious ques-
tion concerning captain woodhouses
position here has arisen if you have
met him before-as i think you have-
it will be to your advantage to tell me
where and when i am in command of
the rock you know

  he finished with an odd tensing of
tone which conveyed assurance of his
authority even more than did the sense
of his words his guest her back to
the table on which the roses rested and
her hands bracing her by their tense
grip on the table edge sought his eyes
boldly

  general crandall she began my
training in hildebrands store hasnt
made me much of a diplomat all this
war and intrigue makes me dizzy but
i know one thing this isnt my war
inside the lines



or my countrys and im going to follow
my countrys example and keep out
of it

  general crandall shrugged his shoul-
ders and smiled at the girls defiance

  maybe your country may not be able
to do that he declared with a touch
of solemnity i pray god it may but
im afraid your resolution will not hold
miss gerson

  im going to try to make it any-
way she answered

  gibraltars commander baffled thus
by a neutral-a neutral fair to look
upon in the bargain-tried another
tack he assumed the fatherly air

  lady crandall and i have tried to
show you we were friends-tried to
help you get home he began

  youve been very good to me jane
broke in feelingly

  what i say now is spoken as a
friend not as governor of the rock if
it is true that you have met woodhouse
before-and our conversation here veri-
fies my suspicion-that very fact makes
his word worthless and releases you
from any promise you may have made
not to reveal this and that you may
know about him also it should put you
on your guard-his motives in any at-
tentions he may pay you cannot be
above suspicion

  i think that is a personal matter i
am perfectly capable of handling
janes resentment sent the flags to her
cheeks

  general crandall was quick to back
water yes yes dont misunder-
stand me what i mean to say is-

  he was interrupted by his wifes
voice calling for jane from the near-
by room anticipating her interrup-
tion he hurried on

  for the present miss gerson well
drop this matter i said a few minutes
ago i intended shortly to-know i
hope i wont have to carry out that-
threat

  jane was withdrawing one of the

buds from the jar at his last word
she dropped it with a little gasp
threat general

  i hope not truly i hope not but

young woman-

  she stooped picked up the flower
and was setting it in his buttonhole be-
fore he could remonstrate

  this one was for you general she
said and the truce was sealed that
minute lady crandall was wafted into
the room on the breeze of her own stac-
cato interruption

  whats this-whats this flirting
with poor old george-pinning a rose
on my revered husband when my backs
turned  brazen miss im here to take
you off to the gardens at once where
you can find somebody younger-and
not near so dear-to captivate with your
tricks at once now

  she had her arm through janes and
was marching her off an exchange
of glances between the governor and
hildebrands young diplomat of the dol-
lar said that what had passed between
them was a confidence

 jaimihr khan announced major
bishop to the general a short time later
the major a rotund pink-faced man
of forty who had the appearance of
being ever tubbed and groomed to the
pink of parade perfection saluted his
superior informally accepted a ciga-
rette and crossed his plump legs in
an easy-chair near the generals desk
general crandall crossed his arms on
his desk and went direct to his subject
major you were here on the rock
seven years ago you say

  here ten years general regular
rock scorpion-old-timer

  do you happen to recall this chap
woodhouse whom i sent to you to re-
port for duty in the signal tower to-
day has transfer papers from wady
haifa

  havent met him yet though cap-
tain carson tells me he reported at my
office a little more than an hour ago-


the cpocpulacr magazine

see him after parade woodhouse-

woodhouse- the major propped

his chin on his fingers in thought

  his papers-army record and all
that-say he was here on the rock for
three months in the spring of nineteen-
seven general crandall urged to re-
fresh the others memory

  major bishop stroked his round
cheeks tugged at one ear but found
recollection difficult

  when i see the chap-so many com-
ing and going you know three months
-bless me thats a thin slice out of
ten years

  major im going to take you into
my confidence the senior officer be-
gan then he related the incident of
cappers visit and repeated the charge
he had made bishop sat aghast at the
word spy

  woodhouse will be here to tea this
afternoon continued crandall while
you and i ask him a few leading ques-
tions ill have jaimihr my indian
search his room in barracks i trust
jaimihr implicitly and he can do the
job smoothly now bishop what do
you remember about nineteen-seven-
something we can lead up to in conver-
sation you know

the younger man knuckled his brow
for a minute then looked up brightly

  i say general craigen was gover-
nor then but-urn-arent you a bit-
mild this asking of a suspected spy
to tea

  what can i do the other replied
somewhat testily i cant clap an of-
ficer of his majestys army into prison
on the mere say-so of a drunken out-
cast who has no proof to offer i must
go slowly major watch for a slip
from this woodhouse one bad move
 his part and he starts on his way
to face a firing squad

  bishop had risen and was slowly pac-
ing the room his eyes on the walls hung
with many portraits in oils

well you cant help admiring the

nerve of the chap he muttered half
to himself forcing his way onto the
rock-why he might as well put his
head in a cannons mouth

  i havent time to admire the gen-
eral said shortly thing to do is to
act

  quite right nineteen-seven eh
uni- he paused before the por-
trait of a young woman in a gainsbor-
ough hat and with a sparkling piquant
face by george general why not
try him on lady evelyn theres a
fair test for you now

  you mean craigens wife the
general looked up at the portrait quiz-
zically skeletons bones bishop
right but no man who ever saw
her could forget i know i never can
poor craigen

  good idea though the older man
acquiesced well trip him on lady
evelyn

  jaimihr khan appeared at the double
doors the general sahibs orderly
he announced the young subaltern en-
tered and saluted

  that young man general crandall
the one sergeant crosby was to escort

out of the lines to algeciras-

  well what of him hes gone i
hope

  first train to madrid general but
he left a message for you sir to be de-
livered after hed gone he said

  a message general crandall was
perplexed

  as sergeant crosby had it and gave
it to me to repeat to you sir it was
arrest the cigar girl calling herself
josefa she is one of the cleverest spies
of the wilhelmstrasse 

chapter xiii

enter a cigarette

  mr joseph aimer proprietor of the
hotel splendide on waterport street
was absorbed heart and soul in a cu-
rious task he was emptying the pow-
inside the lines



der from two-grain quinine capsules
onto a sheet of white letter paper on his
desk

  it was noon of wednesday the day
following the arrival of captain wood-
house aimer was alone in the hotels
reception room and office behind the
dingy glass partially inclosing his desk
his alpaca-covered shoulders were close
to his ears and his bald head with its
stripes of plastered hair running like
thick lines of latitude on a polished
globe was held far forward so as to
bring his eyes on the work in hand
like some plump magpie he appeared
turning over bits of china in a treas-
ure hole

  a round box of the gelatine cocoons
lay at his left hand it had just been de-
livered by an arab boy quick to pick
up the street commission for a tuppence
very methodically aimer picked the
capsules from the box one by one
opened them and spilled the quinine in
a little heap under his nose he grunted
peevishly when the sixth shell had been
emptied the seventh capsule brought
an eager whistle to his lips when he
had jerked the concentric halves apart
very little powder fell out instead the
thin folded edges of a pellet of rice
paper protruded from one of the con-
tainers this aimer had extracted in
an instant he spread it against the
black back of a ledger and read the
very fine script written thereon this
was the message

  danger an informer from alexandria
lias denounced our two friends to crandall
you must warn i cannot

  the spys heart was suddenly drained
and the wisp of paper in his hand trem-
bled so that it scattered the quinine
about in a thin cloud once more he
read the note then held a match to it
and scuffled its feathery ash into the
rug beneath his stool with his feet the
fortitude which had held joseph aimer
to the rock in the never-failing hope
that some day would bring him the op-

portunity to do a great service for the
fatherland came near crumbling that
minute he groaned

  our friends he whispered wood-
house and louisa-trapped

  the warning in the note left noth-
ing open to ambiguity for aimer there
were but four of them-friends un-
der the wilhelmstrasse fellowship of
danger-there in gibraltar louisa the
man who passed as woodhouse and
whose hand was to execute the great
coup when the right moment came him-
self and that other one whose place was
in government house itself from this
latter the note of warning had come
how desperate the necessity for it ai-
mer could guess when he took into reck-
oning the dangers which beset any at-
tempt at communication on the writers
part so narrow the margin of safety
for this friend that he must look at
each setting sun as being reasonably the
last for him

  aimer did not attempt to go behind
the note and guess who was the in-
former that had lodged information
with the governor general he had for-
gotten in fact the incident of the night
before when the blustering capper
called the newly arrived woodhouse by
name the flash of suspicion which
attached responsibility to the american
girl named gerson was dissipated as
quickly as it came she had arrived by
motor from paris not on the boat from
alexandria his was now the impera-
tive duty to carry warning to the two
suspected not to waste time in idle
speculation as to the identity of the
betrayer there was but one ray of
hope in this sudden pall of gloom and
that aimer grasped eagerly he knew
the character of general crandall-the
phlegmatic conservatism of the man
which would not easily be jarred out of
an accustomed line of thought and ac-
tion the general would be slow to leap
at an accusation brought against one
wearing the stripes of service and


the popular magazine

though he might reasonably attempt to
test captain woodhouse one such as
woodhouse chosen by the wilhelm-
strasse to accomplish so great a mission
would surely have the wit to parry sus-
picion

  yes he must be put on his guard as
for louisa-well it would be too bad
if the girl should have to put her back
against a wall but she could be spared
she was not essential after he had
succeeded in getting word of his dan-
ger to woodhouse aimer would con-
sider saving louisa from a firing squad
the nimble mind of herr aimer shook
itself free from the incubus of dread
and leaped to the exigency of the mo-
ment calling his head waiter to keep
warm the chair behind the desk aimer
retired to his room and there was ex-
ceedingly busy for half an hour

  the hour of parade during war time
on gibraltar was one oclock at that
time six days a week the half of the
garrison not actually in fighting posi-
tion behind the great guns of the de-
fense marched to the parade grounds
down by the race track and there went
through the grilling regimen which
meant perfection and the maintenance
of a hair-trigger state of efficiency
down from the rocky eminences where
the barracks stood marched this day
block after block of olive-drab fighting
units-artillerymen for the most part
equipped with the rifle and pack of in-
fantrymen no blare of brass music
gave the measure to their step bands-
men in this time of reality paced two
by two stretchers carried between them
all the curl and snap of silken banners
which make the parade a moving spec-
tacle in ordinary times was absent flags
do not figure in the grim modern busi-
ness of warfare just those solid blocks
of men trained to kill sweeping down
onto the level grounds and massing
rank on rank for inspection and the
trip-hammer pound-pound-pound of
evolutions to follow- silent integers

of power flexing their muscles for the
supreme test which any mornings sun
might bring

  mr henry j sherman stood with his
wife kitty and willy kimball-kim-
ball had developed a surprising interest
in one of these home folks at least-
under the shade of the row of plane
trees fringing the parade grounds they
tried to persuade themselves that they
were seeing something worth while
this pleasing fiction wore thin with
mr sherman before fifteen minutes had
passed

  shucks mother the boys at the
national-guard encampment down to
galesburg fair last year made a better
showing than this he pursed out his
lips and regarded a passing battalion
with a critical eye

  looked more like soldiers anyway
mother admitted those floppy broad-
brimmed hats our boys wear make them
look more-more romantic id say

  but my dear mrs sherman-
willy kimball flicked his handkerchief
from his cuff and fluttered it across his
coat sleeve where dust had fallen-the
guards back in the states are play sol-
diers you know these chaps here-
well they are the real thing they dont
dress up like picture-book soldiers and
show off-

  play soldiers-huh  henry j had
fire in his eye and the pearl buttons
on his white linen waistcoat creaked
with the swelling of a patriots pride
youve been a long time from home
willy perhaps youve forgotten that
your own father was at corinth guess
youve overlooked that soldiers monu-
ment in courthouse square back in lit-
tle old kewanee they were play sol-
diers eh-those boys who marched
away with your dad in sixty-one
gimme a regiment of those old boys in
blue and they could lick this whole
bunch of-

  father kitty had flipped her hand
over her parents mouth her eyes round
inside the lines



with real fear youll get arrested
again talking that way here where ev-
erybody can hear you remember what
that hotel man said last night about
careless remarks about military things
on the rock be good father
there there sherman removed
the monitory hand and patted it reas-
suringly i forgot but when i get
aboard the saxonia and well out to sea
im going to just bust information about
what i think of things in general over
here in this europe place-their botty-
celly pictures and their broken-down

churches and-and- why bless

my soul the little store buyer and
that iowa girl whos married to the
governor here

  the patriot stopped short in his re-
view of the continents delinquencies to
wave his hat at lady crandall and jane
gerson who were trundling down un-
der the avenue of planes in a smart dog-
cart lady crandall answered his hail
with a flourish of her whip turned her
horse off the road and brought her
conveyance to a stop by the group of
exiles hearty greetings passed around
the governors wife showed her unaf-
fected pleasure at the meeting

  i thought you wouldnt miss the pa-
rade she called down from her high
seat only thing that moves on the
rock-these daily reviews brought
miss gerson down here so when she
gets back to new york she can say shes
seen the defenders of gibraltar if not
in action at least doing their hard train-
ing for it

  well i dont mind tellin you
sherman began defiantly i think the
national guard of illynoy can run cir-
cles around these englishmen when it
comes to puttin up a show now kitty
dont you try to drive a plug in your
dads sentiments again mrs crandalls
all right-one of us a shocked look
from his daughter oh there i go
again forgettin lady crandall i
mean excuse me maam

  dont you dare apologize the gov-
ernors wife playfully threatened mr
sherman with her whip i love the
sound of good old-fashioned missis
just imagine-married five years and
nobody has called me mrs crandall
until you did just now wedded but
not a missis wouldnt that be a per-
fectly gorgeous title for a laura jean
novel miss gerson lets hop out and
join these home folks theyre my kind
the burst of laughter that greeted
lady crandalls sally was not over be-
fore she had leaped nimbly from her
high perch henry j gallantly assisting
jane followed and the coachman from
his little bob seat in the back drove the
dogcart over to the road to wait his mis-
tress pleasure the scattered blocks
of olive-gray on the field had coalesced
into a solid regiment now and the long
double rank of men was sweeping for-
ward like the cutting arm of a giant
mower they joined the sparse crowd
of spectators at the edge of the field
the better to see jane gerson found
herself chatting with willy kimball and
kitty sherman a little apart from the
others a light touch fell on her elbow
she turned to find aimer the hotel
keeper smiling deferentially

  pardon-a thousand pardons for
the intrusion lady i am aimer of the
hotel splendide

  you havent remembered something
more i owe you jane challenged
brusquely

  oh no lady aimer spread out
his hands i happened to see you here
watching the parade and i remembered
a trivial duty i have which if i may
be so bold as to ask you may discharge
much more quickly than i-if you will
i discharge a duty-for you  the
girl did not conceal her puzzlement
aimers hand fumbled in a pocket of his
flapping alpaca coat and produced a
plain silver cigarette case unmono-
grammed she looked at it wonder-
ingly


the ppular magazine

  captain woodhouse-you met him
at my hotel last night lady he left
this lying on his dresser when he quit
his room to go to barracks to-day for
me it is difficult to send a messenger
with it to the barracks-war time lady
-many restrictions inside the lines i
came here hoping perhaps to see the
captain after the parade but you-

  you wish me to give this to captain
woodhouse jane finished a flicker of
annoyance crossing her face why
me 

  you are at government house
lady captain woodhouse comes to tea
-all newcomers to the garrison do that
if you would be so good-

  jane took the cigarette case from ai-
mers outstretched hand lady cran-
dall had told her the captain would be
in for tea that afternoon it was a
small matter this accommodation so
long as aimer did not insinuate-as he
had not done-any impertinence imply
any overeagerness on her part to per-
form so minor a service for the officer
aimer bowed his thanks and lost him-
self in the crowd jane turned again
to where kitty and kimball were chat-
ting

  a dun for extra service the landlord
forgot last night ill wager the youth
greeted her

  oh no just a little present jane
laughed back at him holding up the
silver case with aimers compliments
to captain woodhouse who forgot it
when he gave up his room to-day ive
promised to turn it over to the captain
and save the hotel man a lot of trouble
and red tape getting a messenger
through to the captains quarters

  by jove kimballs tired eyes
lighted up with a quick flash of smok-
ers yearning a life-saver came
away from my room without my pet
egyptians-mr sherman yelling at me
to hurry or wed miss this slow show
and all that im going to play the pan-

handler and beg one of your captain
friends smokes he must be a good
sort or you wouldnt be doing little fa-
vors for him miss gerson come now
in your capacity as temporary executrix
will you invest one of the captains
cigarettes in a demand of real charity

  keen desire was scarcely veiled un-
der kimballs fiction of light patter
smilingly the girl extended the case to
him

  just to make it businesslike the
executrix demands your note for-um
-sixty days say for one cigarette
received i promise to pay- 

  given he pulled a gold pencil
from his pocket and made a pretense
of writing the form on his cuff then
he lit his borrowed cigarette and in-
haled gratefully

  your captain friends straight from
egypt i dont have to be told that
willy kimball murmured in polite ec-
stasy at shepards in cairo youll
get such a cigarette as this and no-
where else in a barren world the
breath of the acanthus blossom-if they
really have a breath-never heard

  back in kewanee the ladies aid
society will have you arrested kitty
put in mischievously theyre terribly
wrought up over cigarettes-for mi-
nors

  kimball cast her a glance of deep re-
proach as he lifted the cigarette to
his lips for a second puff janes eyes
mechanically followed the movement
something caught and held them
wonder-filled

  on the side of the white paper cyl-
inder nearest her a curious brown streak
appeared-by the merest freak of
chance her glance fell on it as she
looked the thin stain grew darker near-
est the fresh ash the farther end of
the faint tracing moved-yes moved
like a threadworm groping its way along
a stick

  now what are they all doing out
inside the lines



there kitty sherman was asking
all those men running top speed with
their guns carried up so high

  bayonet charge kimball answered
nothing like the real thing of course
jane gerson was watching the twist-
ing and writhing of that filament of
brown against the white an invisible
hand was writing in brown ink on the
side of the cigarette-writing backward
and away from the burning tip the
script was fine and delicate but legible
it lengthened by seconds

  -and louisa to crandall

  so the letters of silver nitrate formed
themselves under her eyes kimball
took the cigarette from his lips and
held it by his side for a minute he
and kitty were busy with one anothers
company for the time ignoring jane
she burned with curiosity and with ex-
citement mounting like the fire of wine
to her brain would he never put that
cigarette to his lips again so she could

follow the invisible pen so fleeting
so evanescent that worm track on the
paper wrought by fire and by fire to
be consumed a mystery vanishing even
as it was aborning after ages the
unconscious kimball set the cigarette
again in his lips

-n former has denounced you and louisa-t-
-play your game and he will be slow to-

  again the cigarette came away in
kimballs hand acting on impulse she
did not stop to question jane struck it
from the young mans hand and set
her foot on it as it fell in the dust

  oh im clumsy she fell lightly
against kimballs shoulder and caught
herself in well-simulated confusion
standing tiptoe to see what that man
on a horse is going to do-lost my bal-
ance and-and your precious ciga-
rette-gone

  the anguish in jane gersons voice
was not play it was real-terribly
real

to be concluded

bad news from the front

reen b morris one of the most famous characters on american race
tracks once had the distinction of being burned out during a meet at new
orleans his horses other property three-fourths of his stable building and
all his wearing apparel were destroyed he stuck his head out of a window
of what was left of the stable yelled to somebody to bring him some clothes
and eventually made his escape

    he has a second distinction he cannot read

     father bill daly also a great figure on the race tracks could not read
one day as morris was coming out of the paddock at the bennings track
a messenger boy handed him a telegram morris opened it examined it intently
and passed it to father daly with the comment

    isnt that awful

    father daly was equal to the occasion he also examined the yellow piece
of paper and without cracking a smile agreed with morris

    aint that awful

    later they got somebody to read the message to them and found out that
one of their horses had won on another track
         in this corner

the inside story of a unique ring fight told by the manager

                     by h c witwer

inside stuff-sure why theres
an inside story to everything big

terloo was a frame-up or that the
southern army quit cold-but say ill

der how much them losers got-and if
they didnt get it in money you can bet
they got it in somethin just as good
or better-to them

  i guess you didnt see the kid doyle
-tony harvey fight no i knows
you sport writers dont keep tabs on
all the bums a lightweight champion
fights after hes copped the title-but
say if it hadnt been for a skirt youd
a wrote a column about that scrap
and the champions name would a been
harvey instead a doyle this aint no
alibi-dont get me wrong-tony was
knocked cold in two rounds-but i
wants to give you a sample of that in-
side-story thing

 tony harvey-his real name was
antonio angelletti-come from cres-
cent city-thats out in iowa-it was

my town too tony always was a hard
guy when we was kids in school t-
gether tony was the white hope of the
town he trimmed em all big an lit-
tle an never got enough there was
no more yellah in tony than there is

to have around any time if somethin
started-get me

  well tony grows up on them prin-
ciples after he blew school he holds
half a dozen jobs fer a few days apiece

onct in a while an id slip him a piece
of beef to put on a bum eye or some-
thin

  well one saturday night the boss
calls me over after dopin out how much
lies got in the till an what a game
like his oughta pull in an he says

  jake youre too swift fer me boy
i cant dope your stuff out so i gotta
lose yuh heres your bit though i
guess you gotta bigger cut than i did
to-day

  well i soon figgers crescent citys
on the wrong circuit fer me an i de-
cides to blow i was always crazy to
give chicago a whirl an i figgers ill
never get  better chance so i goes
to the bank an draws out the roll-
id been nursin it along an it was
good an healthy-i squares myself up
an goes down to the station while
im waitin fer the train tony blows
in i hadnt saw him fer a week an
i feels kinda wrong when i thinks how
id nearly blew the town without say-
in so long to him on the level i was
so charged up over what im goin to
do when i hits the big town id forgot
all about him

  tony looks about as happy as a guy
whos got a ticket on the fourth horse
at the finish hed bin foot-loose for
a week an as usual is clean as a
whistle of course he wants me to
slip him but while hes pourin out his
hard-luck story im givin him the up
an down he was a fine-lookin kid
tony was-he had one of them i use
holyoke massage cream faces an
could a held a job posin for under-
wear ads any time he didnt smoke
an drank nothin more excitin than
ice-cream soda on the level-add that
to his wallop an yearnin to use it
an tony checks up pretty well

  i always was a quick thinker-i dont
say a good one but a quick one-an
by the time tony gets to ill slip it to

yuh next week i got my cards all
sorted

  do you wanna go to chicago with
me tony i says

  stop at stuff an slip me will you
says tony gettin sore

  i takes him over in a corner an spills
chatter at him for twenty minnits
when i starts he hunches himself up
like he always did before he turned
loose his left an when i stops-say
his eyes is poppin out an his mouths
wide open as a new orleans crap game

  when the train blows outa crescent
city me an tonys on it

  you see i dopes it out like this i
dont know just what play ill make
when i hits the big town i knowed id
get by but i aint figgered out just how
i got a bank roll an tonys there with
a wallop-i figgers that a fair combina-
tion-some pretty big pots have been
copped with lessen at so i decides
to take tony to chi sink a little money
in him an make a champ outa him
good-sized contract eh well listen
tonys broke-hes got no frens in the
burg but me-hed beaten all the other
voters up at one time or another be-
sides tonys game for anythin-al-
ways was

  on the ride into chi tony asks me
more questions than a cats got hairs
he wants to know when hed get a crack
at kid doyle who was the lightweight
champeen then if id stake him to
green tights what his bit would be an
a lotta bunk stuff like that i tells him
ill get him the tights an that ill also
attend to his bit but when i says that
if hes lucky an dont get trimmed
too offen he might meet doyle in a
year say he wants to jump off the
train i quiets him down finally an
right then an there i decides to call
him tony harvey i cant see that
angelletti thing i could hear the an-
nouncer sayin in this corner tony
spaghetti of crescent city so i


the vovulacr magazine

cans the wop moniker but i didnt tell
tony

  well we gets into chi at night i
takes tony to a joint on state street
an after seein he gets a shower makes
him hit the hay i figgers i might as
well start right in as manager then he
kicks a lot at first-he wants to see
the town-but when i tells him ill leave
him flat in chicago if he dont shut up
he turns over an goes to sleep

  the next mornin i has tony gone
over by a regular barber an a tailor
my rolls gettin dented but every time
i breaks a twenty i looks at that left
of tonys an takes the clutch off
after i has him lookin like a regular
guy i starts fer the newspaper offices

  say ive seen a chef take a coupla
eggs an some dough an turn out a dish
fit fer a king but i never seen nothin
before like what them few bones i blew
did for tony he looks so good in
them store togs an that michigan bou-
levard hair cut i hadda hear him talk
to believe he was tony he looks
as good as any of them shippin clerks
we passes on the boulevard an better
than some every third skirt we passes
gives him the eye an them in between
says hello dearie he looks like
ready money an i keeps figgerin he
will be pretty soon

  well i takes tony to the blast
an the comet an all the rest of them
sheets an i gets a hearin at nearly
all of them when them sportin writ-
ers sees me an tony coinin with our
swell scenery an all i guess they fig-
gers we was some champs they couldnt
quite place an then before theyd get
set id start my spiel about tony

  a guy named cole was sportin ed-
itor of the blast he was a regular
fellah he welcomes me like im the
ace of hearts an lies got four red
cards he says

  go ahead partner-tell me lots
about this bird i got two columns of

nice white space to fill to-morrow an
you may be a life-saver-let it go

  well i figgers this a chance of a
lifetime so i let it go for your life i
tells that sport writer things about tony
that if hed ever done em he wouldnt
a let me live in the same ward with
him i tells him how tonys cleaned
up everythin in iowa-i mighta took in
a coupla precincts that tony never seen
maybe-i said the only thing wrong
with tonys wallop was that if he ever
let it go all the way hed kill the other
boy an that guys had made a rep
stayin a round with him in iowa well
this sportin guy eats it up an as fer
tony he just sits there lookin at me
with his tongue hangin out i was
afraid any minnit hed pull some bone
an queer me but he never says a word

  when i stops fer a new deal the
sportin writer holds up his hand

  enough he says from what you
say your boy must be the original pe-
ruvian man-eater the only difference
between him an the average scrapper is
that between an air rifle an a forty-
two-centimeter gun after hearin your
stuff-which no manager of fighters has
told me yet this mornin-im satisfied
that murder will be the result of this
birds first start here however you
can think i fell for it-so can every-
body else because im goin to print it
to-morrow if he stays a round with
some of these preliminary bums around
here ill stop smokin for six months
take him upstairs an have him photo-
graphed 

  well i takes tony upstairs an he
poses in citizens clothes an then he
strips while i goes out an buys him a
pair of tights green sure when
i come back lie puts em on an poses
for some more pitcher guys shootin
over the deadly left an harveys
famous uppercut-you know the old
stuff i had some little trouble with
him at first because tonys idea of jabs
crosses an uppercuts is slightly differ-
in this ccfcrnetr



ent from them generally held tony
never was a boxer know what i mean 
-just plain ruin was what tony meant
to these other guys he knowed as
much about boxin as jess willard does
about bridge whist-but fightin say
them clever guys never got no chance
to make tony look foolish by peckin
at him an dan cm aroun

  tony generally come on about as
slow as the twentieth century limited
an he was just about as nasty too
them there remarkable defensive
fighters you guys write about did their
brain work from the floor as soon as
tony shoots that left he never missed
em no matter where they hid

  well the nex mornin i goes out
early an gets the papers two of them
give us a line one didnt notice us at
all but the blast makes theirs the tony
harvey number tonys all over the
sport page that writin guy had taken
the hop i gives him about tony an
with only that to work on he wallops
the dictionary till its hangin on the
ropes say it looks so good i almost
fell for it myself tony as i says
before is a good looker an strips nice
an he sure looks like the real stuff in
them fightin poses that goes with the
layout i hustles back to the hotel an
wakes tony up

  give that the once over i says
passin the paper to him

  tony blinks opens his eyes an grabs
the paper

  gee thats me aint it he says
but whos dis harvey guy where do
they get that stuff

  i forgot i aint told him id rechris-
tened him when i decides to make a
champ outa him so i says

  why you big boob thats you
whatta ya mean its me he says
gettin outa bed cant them guys
spell down there

  say it took me the best part of an
hour to get tony where hed believe
he could punch as hard by the name of

harvey as he could as antonio angel-
letti

   well after breakfast i scouts aroun
gettin a place fer tony to train i
didnt have much trouble for after the
blast had been on the street a while
the phone in room  rang long an
often i steers off the managers of the
cheap ham-an-bean clubs an other
what nots as they says an after sizin
up things a little i picks a place in
south chicago i didnt wanna get too
close to the big town where them sport
writers could run out an see tony
work an then go back an laff them-
selves sick thinkin of funny names to
call him an the blast guy in print i
takes tony out there an hires a coupla
bums fer him to work with i wasnt
unduly careless about that either for
i didnt want none of them guys to slip
one over on tony in the camp not
that i figgers anybody can do it un-
derstand but this was no time accordin
to my dope to take any chances lessen
a thousand to one for tonys a long
ways from havin arrived yet

  well tony gets down to business an
does his road an gym work like a ma-
jor pretty soon the newspaper boys
come out an gives tony the up an
down an none of them laffed outright
tony would beat the bag an the bums
to a fare-you-well throw the medicine
ball rastle the sack an skip rope like
an ol-timer once i caught a guy from
the examiner grinnin i walks over
to him an says

  some kid eh that boys got an
awful wallop if he lands it

   yes says this guy lightin a ciga-
rette yes an the la salle street
station would kick up a terrible fuss
-if it ever fell down

  tonys sparrin one of them husky
bums at the time an i claps my hands
tony shoots his left an the bum goes
cold to make it good the poor bum
is out for five minnits an the exam-
iner guy gets so excited over bein called


the vovulatr magazine

to the inquest or somethin maybe that
he slips me a cigarette-an beats it

  two weeks after we ians in chi i
gets tony his first fight it went one
round i got a guy called knock-out
moore-i picked him by his name
them one-round an knock-out
guys makes good on their moniker
about as offen as rockefeller loses a
dollar of course that fight didnt do
tony no harm an when he repeats
four or five times in the nex few weeks
an finally gets a newspaper decision
over kid goodman who was touted as
the nex champ well me an tony owns
the town i had more money than a
herrin has bones an im figgerin rents
on apartment houses along the lake
shore in me mind

  about six months after this tonys
got a string of knock-outs after his
name that fills a page in the annual
he aint fightin nothin but good ones
an every time tony pulls on a glove he
gets anywhere from two hundred bucks
up nice money eh well youd
think so if youd done a few years
time in a hick town for ten bucks per
me im his manager aint i never
mind what my bit wa i never had no
moan cornin an neither did tony so
let it go at that

  around this time it begins to be hard
to get a fight tonys as big a card as
sarah bernhardt but the other guys
is lsary of him they didnt want none
of his game an as for kid doyle
the lightweight champ he wouldnt
touch tony with a stick we couldnt
even get him in the same state well
the papers begin roastin the champ an
tony kept challengin him from the
ringside of all the fights we got to
until right before christmas the kid
agrees to meet tony in a twenty-round
mill for the title

  we gotta make concessions to that
doyle guy that should a put him in jail
he wants all the gate money the pitcher
money tickets for his camp an some

friends both ways-an say that guy
even wants the bout called his if it goes
the limit kin ya beat it 

  were so tickled to get a fight with
this guy that tony would a fought him
fer the excitement on the level give
him anything he wants tony whis-
pers to me while theyre drawin up the
articles that bum wont stay a round
with me-i can beat him at marbles
casino or scrappin-just sign him up
every time the champ would kick over
a penny or a pound id moan a little
to make it look good an then id give
in lookin like i thought doyles gettin
away with murder im careful not to
make it too strong for fear ill crab it
an the boutll be called off

  now heres where the skirt comes in
no fighter oughta get married till hes
ready to quit the game one kinda bat-
tlins enough no guy that wants to
get anywhere can get in a ring with
another guy thats got the same reason
for bein there that he has when hes
got babys teeth an wifies hat an
wheres th rent cornin from if i lose
this one on his mind because just
about when hes figgerin will the
butcher stan for another hang-up the
other guy who aint got nothin to
worry about but to get his one-two over
shoots it-an nearly always its all
over

  i thought id watched tony pretty
elose because i was always worryin
that some queen would grab him off
what with his looks an his roll an all
that of course while tony was still
a fine-lookin kid he had a coupla things
that he didnt bring with him from
crescent city his nose was a little
outa gear an one of his ears didnt
check up to what it should because as
i says before tony wasnt no boxer
he was a fighter an well a coupla
guys had got to him before he stopped
em

  it aint moren a week after i signs
in this cornek-



tony to meet kid doyle for the title
that the fatal thing happens as they
says tony gets married he puts it
over on me when i aint lookin id
went to new york to sign him up for
a fight at the garden with young ja-
cobs an when i comes back to chi
tonys signed up with some skirt for a
finish bout of course its too late
to make a holler then i figgers itll
only put me in dutch with mrs tony
an thats just what i didnt want to
happen so i pats tony on the back
instida wallopin him in the nose when
he slips me the big news an then i
blows twenty on one of them cut-glass
fruit bowls or somethin that the
women puts a doily under an sticks on
the center table so little willie wont
knock it over

   tony took me out to a nice little flat
an mrs tony warms right up to me
shes a nice little kid too such as you
might call neat but not gaudy an when
she goes in the kitchen to bring out the
lemonade tony gets up an slaps me
on the back a pip eh jake he
says well they got a piano an mrs
tony plays it an everything goes o
k tonys havin the time of his young
life an takes no pains to hide it when
i finally left them that night i takes
a new deal an figgers maybe tonys
gettin married aint such a bone play
after all but with all that i still had
a hunch that i couldnt shake that tony
should a stayed single till after he beat
doyle anyways

  tony had one fight  before he
meets doyle i didnt pick  hard one

for him because- you never kin

tell if id only saw a fortune teller
or somethin i wouldnt a let him fight
a shadow till the big show-but how
was i gonna dope out what was gonna
happen look here bo i kin figger
the ponies a crap game booze or any-
thing like that but when it comes to
the well-known fair sex-im off em
theyre too swift for me-i cant make

  b

em an never could-an whats more
i never met up with any guy yet that
had any better line on em than that
either

  this bird that tony fights is called
dave smith hes got eight pouns 
tony an he certainly is a willin boy
he stands up to tony an gives him
wallop for wallop for three rounds-
then tony finds the spot an the crowd
goes home tony knowed hed bin to
the fight though-one eye is closed
tight an his lips er thicker than jack
johnsons fer a week after he had
a bad cut at the top of his nose too i
fixes him up some an sends him home

   it aint till a few days later at the
trainin camp that i gets the first flash
on whats cornin even then i didnt
get how serious it is im gettin outa
my car-sure i had one then-when i
hears some laffin its the kinda laff
the comedian gets when he falls over
the rope in the acrobatic act-got me
i pushes through the gang of handlers
an hicks that hangs aroun every day
watchin tony work-an say if i
hadnt been so sore id a done some
laffin myself this cornin champ of
mine is dancin aroun like a chorus
girl doin fancy little steps pawin the
air jerkin his head up an down-say
ever seen them vaudeville acts-bur-
lesque boxin or somethin like that
they calls em-well tony would a
brought down any house with half the
stuff he was pullin there his face is
as serious as the landladys when you
fail to send in an hes workin with
some new guy i never seen before
this bird is about as fast as joe grimm
but lies swift enough for tony this
big bum who couldnt a stayed a round
with a one-armed blind man is hittin
tony wherever he wants-an heres a
crowd of hicks watchin all this an
laffin themselves sick

  i shoves some of em away an grabs
this new sparrin partner by the shoul-
der


the vovulacr magazine

  outside for yours i says back
to the ice wagon-its seven oclock
but tony butts in

  wait a minnit jake wait a minnit
he says whats the matter with this
guy  let him alone i hired him
oh you hired him did you i says
what circus is he with an when do
you join what kinda stuff is this
i says you bonehead dye know
what the sport writersll do when they
get this whadda ya tryin to do kid
me 

  slow up jake says tony easy-
like this stuff is on the level its
new to me but ill get it pretty soon
what is it a dance i asks him
youll get it pretty soon all right
where do you want it i says i
suppose you an kid doyle are gonna
fox trot all over the ring nex month
eh 

  dont you see what im gettin at
says tony

no i says sore as a stubbed toe
tony gives this new guy whos tak-
in it all in a look that says dont
mind the poor boob he dont know
nothin then he says to me

  well stupid then ill wise you up
im gonna mix a little of this scientific
stuff with my wallop the nex time i
start nix on the roughneck stuff-
im gonna box kid doyle into so many
knots that hell kill himself gettin un-
tangled 

  you mean hell laff himself to death
if you pull any of that stuff on him
i says tryin to control myself im
good an sore then all my time an
dough wasted on a guy like that why
tony couldnt win a fight from the
worst hick on earth if he tried to box
him he simply wasnt born a boxer
he was a fighter from the feet up a
tearin maulin man-eatin scrapper
they never seen him cornin he come
so fast an when he hit em-they fell
down an stayed there thats the stuff
that put him where he was but a

boxer nothin doin an here just
before hes gonna fight the scrap of his
life he wants to learn some scientific
stuff an he hires some tramp that
couldnt do a hundred yards in nine
hours to make him fast this hicks
name by the way is cyclone reddy
cyclone ha ha aint it rich the names
them guys pick out cyclone tony
dug him up down in the loop some-
where i think he must a been cham-
peen booze fighter of the world from
his breath an general get-up

  go sit down bo i says finally to
the cyclone take a load off your
feet your speed dazzles me i wanna
rest my eyes-an while im doin it ill
interview your friend tony there
with that i takes tony to one side
tony i says i took you outa
crescent city an put you where you
are in lessena year where would ya
be now if it wasnt for me back in
crescent city sleepin in stables
wouldnt ya i took a chance on you
an then made you good now you
gotta chance to be lightweight cham-
peen you knows what that means if
you cop thirty weeks with some
show a few more knockin out bums
an more dough than you ever heard of
in your life before you fight this guy
doyle an the titles yours-try to box
him an youll never get close enough
to him to be sure of his color hell
make you the laffinstock of chicago an
they wouldnt let you in another fight
club with a ticket who steered you on
this boxin stuff anyway

  tony keeps quiet for a minnit an
then he says

  jake its like you say you bin
a good guy to me an i guess i owes
you a lot-thats the reason im gonna
tell you this an i wants you to keep
it under your hat you knows i got
pretty well used up in that last scrap
i had a big ear an a bum lamp an me
lips is sore yet well when i left you
an went home after the fight that night
in this cocrnek-

 

it was pretty late-so i lets meself in
the flat kinda quiet so i dont wake
the missis but shes sittin up for me
when she hears me she comes runnin
out in the hall an when she gets close
to me she gives a little yell an caves in
shes out cold jake-i runs out in
the kitchen an gets a glass of water-
after while she conies to-she sits up
an looks at me an then she puts her
hands over her face an starts to heller
i keeps pat tin her head an askin her
whats the joke-im getting real wor-
ried when she points to me face i runs
for a lookin-glass an pikes a coupla
times-an then kinda slow i gets it 
you know that smith guy certainly
pounded me up some jake i guess
the wife thought id been boxin a street
car well i goes back an pats her on
the head some more an salves her up
some but she dont come around every
onct in a while she gets a flash at me
face an then she goes off bellerin again
i finally gets her quieted down an she
puts a lotta cold cream an stuff like
that on me an goes to bed but all
night i hears her cryin when she thinks
im asleep-i aint doin no sleepin
jake im layin there figgerin out
some way to fight so me facell look
human when i gets outa the ring
along about five a m i dopes out that
im gonna box em from now on an
keep em away

  tony stops then an looks at me as
much as to say im a pretty clever
kid eh well all this stuffs hits me
in a heap i lets it sink in for a minnit
-deep im doin some thinkin too

  tony i says you got my sym-
pathy an so has the missis gettin
married has done what none of them
fighters has been able to do to you i
aint sayin nothin against the missis-
but you aint gettin paid for yer looks
tony an you are gettin big money for
scrappin you gotta expect to get beat
up now an then-you aint playin ten-
nis youre a fighter-an you aint

never was or never will be a boxer
them guys are born that way

  how bout mike gibbons an packey
mcfarlan puts in tony

  why you poor bum i says them
guys have spent a lifetime learnin how
to duck wallops all you ever found
out is how to deliver em-which is just
as good an better for you maybe
in a coupla years you might learn how
to stop em with your hands instid a
your face but in the time you got
before you meets doyle all you can
figger on is to learn this comic act
youre rehearsin now kid doyles the
greatest box fighter that ever pulled on
a glove-boxin em is where he wins
out the only chance you got to beat
him is to tear in from the bell youll
have to take about ninety wallops
maybe before you gets yours over-but
when you do an im bcttin it all that
you will-the fightll be over that way
you beat him but box him you
say dont make me laff-you cant
make a boxer outa a natural slugger
tony an i can show you a million guys
thats tried it all you can do is spoil
him the crowd dont think lies tryin
to box-they figgers hes yellah an
wont fight

  dye think that stopped tony-say
you didnt know that bird

  you may be right he says gettin
up but i figger ill surprise you i
got some fast boys cornin out here
to-day to show me somethin-im
gonna take on two of em at once for
speed ill make kid doyle travel like
he never did before after i outpoints
him jake im gonna stop him-
watch me

  yes i says ill watch you i aint
got nothin else to do now i thought i
could make somethin outa you but a
bums a bum i guess

  just then a kid comes runnin into the
gym an hands tony a book its about
boxin an was got out by jim corbett
tony shows it to me an says


the cpocpular magazine

  i guess im pretty well heeled now
eh jake

  what could ya do with a guy like
that 

  i quits cold the newspaper boys
come out to see tonys final work-out
it was rich tony spars with two kids
that never got near enough to him to
touch him with a stick tony looks
awful good-to them the kids are
afraid hed shoot his left an they keeps
away the newspaper bunch goes back
an says that besides tonys terrible
left lies developed amazin cleverness
i never could figger out since if they
was kiddin him or not

  well as the time for the big fight
gets near tony keeps gettin stronger
for this boxin thing instid a gettin
discouraged when even his own
handlers laffs at him he keeps right
on shadow boxin an skippin rope an
sparrin with these hams the day
before the fight he admitted he was the
greatest boxer in the game

  the fight was put on in milwaukee
wilson couldnt a bought his way into
the club after seven oclock say
theyre hangin on the paint tony an
me had made a lotta friends in chicago
an theyre all there with bells on
kid doyle was favrite in the bettin
an tonys friends grabbed up every
nickel of doyle money they could get
me-i laid off it say if they
knowed what i did they wouldnt a
risked a transfer on their friend tony
but they didnt-an i couldnt help fig-
gerin what theyd do when they seen
tony fight-an after

  tonys as cool as medicine hat when
we gets to the club he kept tellin me
how good his footwork is

  i hopes so i says because youll
have to do a piece of runnin tony
when this fights over

  youre a swell guy to have aroun
tony says you shoulda been an
undertaker for youre the greatest little
crape hanger i ever seen i suppose

you think this bums got a chance with
me eh

  he was grinnin when he said it
hed got to where he knowed he was
goin to win he actually knowed it
-ever seen them kind a guys

  while were workin on him in the
dressin room i tries to get to him once
more

  tony i says listen to me boy-
fergit this boxin stuff an go to this
guy that funny stuffs all right for
the camp but can it here this is the
big night tear after this guy an get
him-you kin do it you got it in you-
but you gotta do it quick

  tony just laffs

 them roughneck days is over
jake he says watch me

  well i goes out an climbs into a
chair by the ringside i hadda sit half
on some guys lap theyre packed so
tight all aroun me i seen the sport
writers an they seen me an i guess
i musta looked the way i was feelin
because they all kidded me finally
kid doyle comes out an climbs into
the ring the crowd yelled some but
the roof didnt shake from the noise
doyle was a champeen all right but
he got his title by duckin wallops not
landin em an that kind of a champ
will get kidded where a roughneck that
dont know nothin but how to dump
em over will get a hand like billy
sunday

 but when tony comes outa the
dressin room-say i can shut me eyes
an hear em now they yells an
pounds on the floor an whistles an
some guys have brung horns along-
well it keeps up for five minnits easy
it rattles me an it woulda rattled you
-did it rattle tony-well not to any
large extent as they says he bows an
scrapes like an actor an then gives
a little run down the aisle an boosts
himself over the ropes

  some speed says the guy im sit-
tin on
in this conetr-



  well the noise keeps up more or
less till doyle looks over tonys
bandages an tony sees doyles the
announcer climbs outa the ring an in
another minnit they rung the bell

  tony hops off his chair an starts
at doyle like a cabaret dancer doyle
backs away kind a puzzled-lies read

hill the fisherman

ames j hill the builder of the great northern has a strong touch of
the savage huntsman in his blood in early summer wherever he may be
whether in new york at his farm in st paul in seattle or in the farthest
northwest this love for the wilds asserts itself and instinctively the railroad
pioneer can sense that the salmon are running far over in the distant st
lawrence past his old hunting camp on st johns river

    so keen is this natural instinct of mr hills that he can tell almost to the day
when the game fish suddenly leave their grounds in the unknown depths of the
ocean to start running up into the fresh water of the rivers of labrador to
spawn

    in mr hills camp  the coast of saguenay a watcher is stationed on the
lookout for the first signs of salmon the news of its approach is rushed to
new york st paul or other points as the case may be but mr hill guided
by instinct very often has started on his trip before the message has reached him

    from the opening day of the sport mr hill goes after the wild game of
the river with all the energy skill and craftiness that he once devoted to out-
witting his rivals of the rail for three weeks he thinks of nothing else and
 human event can come between him and his sport in fact his orders are
positive that he must not be disturbed during this period by any letters mes-
sages or corporation developments however important imperative or critical
they may be

    in his canoe  the wild river in saguenay provided only with a light pole
and line mr hill finds the fishing an exciting diversion

    the big fish are tired out on the line and the guide stands ready to gaff
them as they are hauled in over the side of the boat mr hill has an average
daily record of sixteen fish and they are big fellows too

    when his steam yacht the wacouta begins her trip to new york city from
the fishing camp she is loaded down as a rule with at least three hundred fish
packed in refrigerators it is mr hills custom to wire his friends in whatever
part of the country they may be where shall i send your fish each big
salmon frozen solid and packed in sawdust is placed in an air-tight box fully
three inches thick and sent to its destination and all the friends of the great
railroad builder-and there is a long list of them-are regaled with a surfeit of
delicious salmon steaks

the land of sheep

it seemed a land of rigor and of
waste there was the sunlight of
may tenderly assertive of the
rights of the season but the wind
of march appeared to have come back
to comb its rough fingers through the
shivering willows

  drifts of snow still gleamed in the
indentures of the hills like tenacious
teeth fastened upon the brown land
each drift with  its trickling rivulet
speeding to swell some ribald stream
in the poor shelter of banks and wil-
low clumps where they had drifted
blindly with the icy winds to perish
in unuttered agony now half hidden by
the torrents rushing past and on bleak
knolls where they had dropped when
the giddy pangs of starvation filmed
their eyes the thin carcasses of range
cattle lay in scores on station plat-
forms were heaped great stacks of
fresh sheep hides all bearing testimony
on the severity of the winter then pass-
ing

  the little train had been wearing its
way northward since early morning
heading into the land of sheep the
smoking car which looked as if it had
worn out its usefulness carrying new
jersey commuters and then had gone
west with the same hope of rejuvena-
tion as impels men to face that way
was carrying a band of disputatious
shearers bound for the big sheds along
the northwestern

  they were cursing the cold with
unanimous voice for they found it bit-
ter coming into it unprepared as they
had come from the warmth of arizona
reeking rancidly with the grease of
countless fleeces shorn since they be-
gan the season away down in sonora

  few of them wore overcoats several
had not even outside shirts their brown
necks showing oily as whalers above
the grimy limits of undergarments for
it is a shearers way to buy and wear
out never to wash the few and simple
garments which his untidy trade al-
lows there had been much smoking
with passing of twists plugs and
pouches up and down and some drink-


the popular magazine

ing from broad-shouldered bottles
which several of them had tucked away
in their scant gear

  all of them carried shears all but
the one called the dutchman some
had them sticking points upward out
of the breast pockets of their coats
some stowed them under the straps
of meager bundles and flat-bellied grips
but all that the dutchman had to show
for the cleaning-up they had given him
in cheyenne was a scythe stone black
and greasy which he guarded in the
inner pocket of his short hike-tailed
coat

  the dutchman was a little man hard-
lumped at the cheek bones gaunt of
the neck white-eyebrowed white-mus-
tached-that sweated-out kind of white
which has no tint of age in it no mat-
ter how old nor of youth no matter
how young he was a scorched and
dry-looking man rimmed red around
the eyelids like a thresher it made
one thirsty just to look at the dutch-
mans neck

  but there was a great amount of ex-
cellence in that peculiar black whetstone
which he carried according to his talk
in the early part of the day he had
diverted his companions of chance by
telling stories of which the stone was
the heart and the bone later when
the liquor began to claw inside of their
otherwise empty stomachs and set them
on quarrelsome edge the dutchman
employed it as a wand of peace

  more than once when greasy fists
were flourished and combats seemed
imminent the dutchman had spraddled
between them along the cluttered aisle
of the rocking car and brought the tal-
ismanic stone from his pocket hold-
ing it tenderly in his palm and strok-
ing it with affection in his red bordered
eyes he would cunningly draw the dis-
putants attention to certain marvelous
qualities with which the black cube in
the sacred kabah itself could not com-
pare

  he had such an entirely extraneous
way of coming into disputes like smoke
blowing or dust whipping up that he
always succeeded in drawing one or
both parties to the threatened combat
off before it came to blows his cun-
ning seemed to win him little credit
among his fellows but it had come
early in the day to be admired by one
who sat apart in a back corner of the
car

  this was a young man with smooth
scholarly face who wore his long light
hair combed back like the crest of a
cockatoo shiny bright glasses rode
upon his large hard-backed nose and
his clear blue eyes looked through them
with humorous gleam one might have
thought looking at him grinning over
the dutchmans labors of pacification
that he had just stepped out for a day
of diversion and that to-morrow would
see him back in the classrooms with
his books

  not so however p d-such the
two black letters on the end of his good
leather suit case proclaimed him-was
what the college world from which he
lately had emerged considered a fin-
ished man p d held some such no-
tion himself perhaps as a man should
for self-esteem and self-confidence are
more than half the battle not that
he was long in ethics broad in philos-
ophy deep in languages and literature
unmatched in polemics far from it
p d would have told you if you had
been on that little wyoming train that
day and put the question that he was
an agronomist

  he would have called it scientific
fanner only he never had farmed
back in the agricultural college which
he had quitted but a little while gone
they laid stress on the rashness of
claiming to be a scientific farmer be-
fore one had farmed one could be
an agronomist with safety in any com-
pany but scientific farmers are getting
to be so common that one must be pre-
the cprobation of cp d



pared to defend the title before he as-
sumes it he is likely to bump into
one of them in a pullman car taking
him for a banker you know

  and so p d was a plain agronomist
who had specialized for three years in
animal husbandry he could do more
than talk wisely of mans helpful crea-
tures having had intimate association
with seventeen sheep on the college
farm

  p d was coming into the west to
realize on his knowledge he had
headed for wyoming after reading a
story in a magazine about the sheep-
herdcr who landed from ireland with
fifty-five dollars fifty of which he put
down before a ticket agent saying
give me a ticket as far west as thatll
take me the story was newer then
than now and had not been credited
to so many heroes in so many favored
states by so many strong-armed writers
from everywhere

  he had a little capital which he pro-
posed to invest and sectional maps
from the united states land office
showing all the public lands within the
state wherein he had planned to plant
his feet and make his fortune he was
coming into the atmosphere of his ex-
pectations now and he was glad to be
in that smoky little car with those smell-
ing shearers and listen to their talk
and their tales already he felt that
he had a part in the life that they lived

  p d sat back in his corner seat
next the window his suit case upended
to make room for the baggage of an-
other who might occupy the untenanted
half all day his seat had been a sort
of catchall for short-trip passengers
who piled in with gunny sacks and bas-
kets but now that class of travelers
had fallen off the stations were miles
upon miles distant from each other and
houses by the way were exceedingly
rare the shearers and himself were
the only occupants of the car now and

the day was blending of into the gray
of evening

  the cars water tank was opposite
him and p d fell under the scrutiny
of every thirsty shearer who came to
drink some looked at him with in-
terest some with lofty indifference
some with humor some with scorn
one sinewy young man of about his
own age with long black hair standing
out like cold bristles under his little
cloth cap had passed unsympathetic re-
marks on his glasses and his gear sev-
eral times as he spraddled before the
place where p d sat and now he came
swaggering back again with more
liquor than was good for his years
and drew heavily on the dented water
tank

  p d said he wiping his mouth
with one black finger reading the ini-
tials on the upended baggage that
might stand for pearl daisy or it might
be purty dear

  yes it might admitted p d red-
dening up considerably dont you
like it

  no i dont and i dont like you
and i dont like the country where you
come from and i aint got no use for
the place youre a-goin to said the
young shearer calling it off in loud
voice

  im sorry said p d calm enough
the red drawing out of his cheeks as
if his face had sprung a leak but i
dont see how im to help you any

  p d took a little flat case out of
his vest pocket and put his glasses away
in it he pushed the suit case with
its offending letters a little farther over
against the wall of the car and got to
his feet undoubling quite a respectable
length of limb and back

  the shearer eyed him up and down
weaving on his legs like a spider

  i double up fellers like you and
snap my fingers at em said he

  then the dutchman came he sat


the cpocpulacr magazine

down  the arm of p ds seat the
black whetrock in his hand

  well sir the time i had up the bet
with old man horner down in val
verdes county said he in colloquial
tone without a quaver of excitement
not a shade too high nor too low i
had seven pair of shears i sharpened
 this rock i ever tell you about
that budge

  budge was the shearer who had such
a deep dislike for the place of p ds
origin and scorn for his destination
he looked at the dutchman with a sour
face

  no i never heard about that bet
and i dont never want to hear he
said turning away

  budge went back to his place and
p d sat down sliding over to give
the dutchman room the dutchman
put the stone away in his pocket with
a weary little sigh which he turned into
a laugh before it fairly got a start

  budge lies a funny feller he said
what you sellin

  im not selling anything said p d

  oh said the dutchman i thought
you might be a good many jew fel-
lers come through here this time of the
year with shears and watches and
things you know but you aint no
jew

  not likely grinned p d

  no said the dutchman positively
i dont see where youd make a jew
name out of them two letters they
might stand for what budge said he
reflected as if to himself

  yes they might but they dont
p d told him in this case they
stand for peter doster thats my
name

  thats a good sound name the
dutchman approved with a heartiness
which seemed relief from the fear that
it was going to turn out something
denatured peters a good name it
always makes me think of rye bread

  hows that peter wanted to know

i dont know but it does well
ill be leavin you at the next station
thats the end of your journey is
it asked peter affably feeling under
a certain obligation to the dutchman

  no im goin on to the shearin
sheds twelve miles ahead but thats
the end of my ride peter heh and
youd fight too dang if you wouldnt
and i guess youd claw out some hair
even if you do look a little white and
soft

  maybe allowed peter with becom-
ing modesty

  well shes slowin up for the depot
and i guess ill have to drop off and
leave you maybe youd better go back
to the other car for that feller budge
he may pick trouble with you after im
gone and even if you did wind him
up all the rest of ems likely to pile
on just because you dont look the same
as them

  did you say you were heading for
vesper-thats the next station isnt
it

  double yes said the dutchman but-
toning his thin coat ill hit the ties
the rest of the way well so long
im headed for vesper and thats
the end of the trail for me too said
peter why dont you stay on-do

you mean that-

  my money wouldnt quite stretch
it the dutchman said none of them
fellers aint got it to lend me-nobody
but that scotchman with that fuzzy coat
on him and i aint got no government
bond to give him for security

  how much is it

  sixty cents the dutchijian said
  if youd let a stranger advance

it- hesitated peter

  sure said the dutchman settling
down in the seat again with no trouble
now in hail ill hand it back to you
if we ever meet sure peter i will
accept as the maiden said

  the dutchmans companions seemed
unconcerned whether he left the train
the probation of p d



or stayed on with the exception of
the scot in the fur coat and woolen
cap they were bunched together over
what remained in the last bottle noisy
and full of words when the train
started again the scot turned to see
what had become of the man who had
no security for a loan of sixty cents
when he saw the dutchman compla-
cently seated beside the stranger he got
up and made the water tank his excuse
for eying the soft one over

  so yere r-r-riadin are ye said
he

  i am thank you for the kindness
of askin me mackeigan the dutch-
man replied

  no thanks ye owe me not even so
much said the scot yed whussel
in yr lingers a long time before yed
fiddle a loan out o me

  thank you for refusin me then
mackeigan the cheery dutchman said

  he went on with his talk to peter
leaving mackeigan growling to him-
self

  so youre cornin in to try your hand
at sheep said the dutchman having
found that out which was no matter
for concealment on the part of peter
indeed well well may luck go with
you youre goin to a good spot for
findin out about the business too
vespers the center of it in this part
of the state and the one man for you
to git next to qbove all others is old
dan sweeney hell be around here
hot and heavy with no less than thirty
thousand sheep to shear

  thats a comfortable bunch al-
lowed peter

  it is said the dutchman with fi-
nality and dan he made it from noth-
ing you might say when dan landed
in new york he had fifty-five dollars
he put fifty of it down in the ticket-
office winder and he said to the feller
gimme a ticket as fur west as thatll
take me in a straight line says dan
it carried him to vesper and he had

five dollars to start with when he
stepped off of the train

  peters version of it was centered
around a man with quite another name
and his ranch was in the red desert
some three or four hundred miles dis-
tant from his present location and the
scene of dan sweeneys triumphs he
said nothing about it not wishing
to start an argument the dutch-
man appeared to believe he had the
right of it

  well were there said the dutch-
man peering out of the window into
the dark specked here and there by a
yellow light were right up to the gate
of your promised land if i ever see
you agin peter ill hand you back that
sixty cents

chapter ii

the voice in tiie wind

  at that time vesper was nearer to
what a town should be for the pur-
poses of picturesque fiction than any
town in the west is to-day it lay in
a broad plateau valley hills far away
on one hand mountains farther away
on the other and a yellow river came
winding down in low banks past its
door

  it was a place of low-built houses
which seemed lower because there was
nothing to measure them against but the
far-reaching hollow sky there were
no trees in vesper and no grass noth-
ing but the gray soil cut to dust by
hoofs and heels one street led away
from the railway station and ended at
the river bank and beside and across
this thoroughfare other indefinite ave-
nues ran they counted for little for
people only lived in them and had their
homes their wives and their children
there it was the main street that was
on the map at vesper

  there were saloons along it shoul-
dered side by side with liquor enough
in them it seemed to lave all the hot


the popular magazine

tongues for a thousand miles on every
side there were gaming tables in all
of them and in some of them there
was music and singing at night

  there were a few large business
houses selling the substantial merchan-
dise such as a rough-riding land re-
quired and a bank and a milliner as
there arc banks and milliners every-
where that money accumulates and van-
ity lives the business of vesper
amounted to millions in a year for it
was the wool market of the northwest
and much of the money that came into
it through labor and long watches
leaked out of it like water upon its
thirsty soil through the saloons and
gambling lairs

  by day it was a somnolent place
when respectability came in to buy
wagons and hats and put its money
in the bank but come nightfall and
there was a moving change it was as
if day vesper had been rolled up on
a curtain and night vesper let down
all yellow-splotched with lights noisy
with fiddles and harps of the italian
musicians pierced with the febrile
laughter of women jarred by the hoarse
whoops of brawling men here gallop-
ing riders came arriving sweeping
around the corners like wild winds and
there others mounted and sped away

  night long they screeched and fiddled
and sent their piercing laughter out of
their husks of hearts and at dawn the
night picture faded out again to the
gray commonplace of business milli-
ners bankers and those who labored
that the wastrels of the night might
live

  into this place then came peter
doster agronomist with his hopes in
his hand to make his fortune out of
sheep

  peter was cautious about venturing
out to try the mysteries of vesper that
night from the door of the hotel there
appeared to be too many vague stretches
of darkness between the gleaming fronts

of saloons where respectability had put
out its lamps and gone home with the
key in its pocket all the illumination
of vesper came through its window-
panes and a stranger must lift the
feet high and put them down with
care

  theyre taking money away from
them with both hands to-night and
holding the sack with their teeth said
some one behind him

  peter turned to note that a benevo-
lent-looking man in gray who had
drawn his attention in the hotel office
a little while before had come out and
stood near him in the recess of the
bevel-mouthed entrance he seemed to
have made the observation to himself
for his eyes were on the bright fronts
across the way and his fresh cigar
pointed toward them resolutely like an
accusing finger

  yes sir they seem to be pretty
busy said peter feeling that the
usages of that informal country de-
manded something in return

  stranger here i believe said the
large man who looked larger for his
bulky clothing tall fur cap almost as
large as a drum majors shako

  yes sir i came in on the evening
train

  aim to stay long if its any of a
strangers business 

  well i came here with a view to
settling down said peter

  so one word brought on another as
words will do even between strangers
and soon peter was inside the hotel
office with his feet in the window and
his chair tilted back just as much at
home as if he carried harness samples
or had come there to buy wool the
man in the tall cap sat beside him in
full possession of peters little story

  well if youll take the advice of a
man old enough to be your father and
a good wide margin of years to lap over
besides youll take a job as herder be-
fore you plunge into the business on
the probation of p 



your own hook he said the time
was when you could have come here
with seven hundred dollars-peter had
given him the sum total of his capital
in hand-and set up in the sheep busi-
ness but you cant do it now the
first thing youve got to make sure of
is living water within easy reach-i
mean not more than three days drive
at the most-and the waters about all
leased up bought up or occupied in
some way

  take my own case for example
i came out here twenty years ago and
taught school right here in vesper and
worked politics and grafted around as
honest as i could till i got a strip of
river front up above here about fifty
miles i started little and i own five
miles of water front now i suppose
ive froze out many a young feller like
you but it all goes in the big grab
game of life now if you want to
go in for sheep come up to the ranch
with me take a job as herder and learn
the game from the smallest move up
youll want to spend a winter on the
range anyhow before youll know
whether you can stick-dont put a cent
into it till youve gone through one
winter at least

  the clerk told peter when he called
at the desk for his key that he could
consider himself favored by fortune to
be taken up that way by gomer carter
one of the biggest sheepmen in the
state

  carters a virginian said the clerk
and hes a gentleman down to the
tacks ive heard them say that he
started from richmond with fifty-five
dollars to his name he walked into
the ticket office and put fifty of it down
in the window and he said give me
a ticket as far west as thatll take me
it brought him to vesper and he put
the five dollars left over to work look
what he is to-day

  so there was the old story again
but in a different coat peter won-

dered whether the verities of that coun-
try all measured according to its simil-
itude and if so what chance he would
have in it with his seven hundred dol-
lars one thing was past dispute
that hoarded treasure did not look as
big to him as it did when he boarded
the train two days before he had a
feeling now that he ought to apologize
for it and hide it away like a shame

  but it was through that meeting by
the medium of a casual remark with
gomer carter that peter found him-
self out among the hills with a thou-
sand sheep under the care of his hand
and eye three thousand would be his
allotment carter told him when he
had learned the trick but it looked to
peter as if he had a million already
two thousand more he was sure would
fill the world to the horizon

  but it is a long way to the horizon
in the sheep lands and peter was lone-
somely aware of that before three days
had filled above his head spring veg-
etation was scarcely showing yet and
peters flock already shorn and shiver-
ing in the raw winds was feeding on
the dry herbage of last summers
growth conserved by the prudent flock-
master for this tiding over until the
green should show

  the feeding was sparse and the
sheep were pitifully hungry and thin
peter ranged them over a wide terri-
tory daily and back again on tired legs
at evening to the bedding ground below
his wagon a few days familiarity
with his flock and the immensity in
which they grazed dispelled the first
notion that three thousand sheep would
spread out over half the state when
he looked down on the thousand under
his care as he rested in the sun on a
hill crest liis alert dog by his side they
seemed no more than a handful of dust

  one day peter believed that he was
going to take to that life like a calf to
bran mash the next he found himself
leaning with strong inclination which


the popular magazine

amounted almost to yearning for forty
acres of kansas land his barometer
was unsettled as falls the case of nearly
everybody in a strange land and he was
still balancing on the matter of going or
staying when he first heard the voice
in the wind

  at that time peter had been in the
hills more than a week he had not
seen a human being since the day the
camp mover stationed his wagon on the
top of a long ridge and drove away
leaving him alone with the sheep save
for himself indeed the world seemed
empty of humankind he could not see
even the wgon of another herder from
the hilltops and he had strained his eyes
in vain for the smoke of their camp
fires

  on this day of his adventure the wind
set in from the south with a pleading
gentleness of touch on the cheek as
if it had come before its hour and
begged to be permitted to remain peter
imagined that it carried to him the scent
of fresh-turned furrows and the spice
of burning stalks and grasses from his
native fields he had just about con-
vinced himself that forty acres with
the neighbors houses in sight was
about the patch of land for him sitting
there on the hillside with his cudgel
leaning against his knee

     but me and my true love
     will never meet again

     on the bonny bonny banks
     o loch lomond

  the song came wavering to him as
if the singer had begun the chorus be-
fore mounting the hill where the wind
could catch her melody and bear it
from her lips for it was a womans
voice far away and faint yet strangely
wild and sweet

  peter started as if some one had
spoken in his ear believing that he had
fallen asleep and dreamed but the dog
had lifted his head his ears erect lis-
tening

         twas there that we parted

       in yon shady glen-

  fainter the song now as if the singer
were passing on her way wherever it
might lead among those unkind hills
peter scrambled to the top of his hill
in the hope that his eye might be glad-
dened by the sight of her

  there was nobody in sight yet one
might be near and yet unseen for the
hills lay in confusion like storm-beaten
water on every side shoulder-high
sage and the scrub growths of fire-
stunted timber covered them even a
rider would be lost in a moment from
the sight among them

  peter stood panting after his quick
run up the slope turning his eager face
this way and that his dog had come
with him it stood a rod or two in
advance of him as curiously mystified
as himself

  now the song came again rising and
falling and growing dim the sweetly
tuneful voice dwelling long upon the
closing words of the chorus presently
it faded from his hearing

  peter felt that he should not permit
his curiosity to run into impertinence
doubtless the singer was some ranchers
daughter familiar with the country rid-
ing past  a social or business errand
the incident seemed to lift the shadow
of loneliness from the land it must
have its pleasant places and its refine-
ments to breed a voice such as hers
said he returning to his sheep cheered
and comforted perhaps after trying
it out duly he might stay there after
all

  peter hummed the old tune of loch
lomond that evening as he warmed
canned beans over his fire there
seemed to be excellencies in the melody
hitherto undiscovered he tried it in
full voice smiling as the echo gave it
back to him from the cliffs beyond

  next day he ranged the sheep in a
new pasture on the side of his camp
opposite the scene of his pleasant sur-
the cptrokatlon of p d



prise of the preceding day the wind
had shifted to the northwest bearing
charges of snow now and then there
was a gray sky and the wide horizon
of yesterday seemed to have drawn in
upon him the sheep kept close against
the lee of the hill bleating their lament
for the thick coats which the shearers
had stripped so unseasonably from their
backs

  peter was thinking that one must go
a long way to find a hearth with a blaze
on it from the place where he leaned
his back against a splintered rock that
dun mid-afternoon and in the train
of this comfortless reflection there came
again the air of loch lomond
sweetly faintly as before it seemed
to temper the boisterous wind and
peter smiled before he wondered start-
ing from his reverie

  the singer seemed far off for the
words of her song were lost only the
melody came to him rising now as if
she approached

  peter felt that he must see her but
from the top of the hill the gray land-
scape was empty as on the day before
still her voice came down the wind
with the diminuendo breaks as of one
walking or riding fast and passing
through hollows and over hills strange
that he could not see her for the spot
where he stood commanded a full view
of the country beyond the range of
the human voice yet she was not in
sight and her song came still trailing
and plaintive on the wind

  peter stood for a little while in the
mist of his mystification then his
head cleared and the thought of
wraiths and bogies went out of it with
a smile for his momentary silliness
she had done half her errand what-
ever it had been and now she was go-
ing back home that was a country of
distances such as women would have
considered insuperable back home of
course she had ridden on over the
hills out of sight and her voice car-

ried far in the silences he went back
to the sheep

  but that did not account for the voice
in the wind next day at about the same
hour the wind was westerly then and
shifting again toward the south in-
vestigation was as fruitless as before
he seemed to have the hills to himself

  peter began to get into a sweat over
it the thing troubled his sleep and
the music had gone out of the song
he drove his flock out in another direc-
tion the next morning and the sun was
bright over the hills with a south wind
rising in promise of warmth and green
herbage

  if somebody was trying to play a joke
on him thought peter it was about
time that he should get to the bottom
of the trick let that voice strike up
again to-day and hed rack out after
it and run it down if he had to chase
it clear across wyoming peter didnt
want any such mystery hanging in the
wind to harrow up his peace

  at half past three peter stood ex-
pectantly his watch in his hand that
was the hour for his unseen serenader
to strike up her melody still there
in the sunshine of that spring day there
seemed little in that fact that the gen-
eral pleading of coincidence would not
cover it had just happened so said
peter bold as a man is with the sun-
light on his back to-day she would
not sing the hands of the watch were
moving past the minute of mystery to-
day she-

    oh yell tak the high road
    and ill tak the low road

and ill be in scotland afore ye-

  there it was almost in his ear it
seemed such a breathing sweet voice
redundant of youth and the heart of
love itself

  peter was up and away his heart
knocking his ribs his glasses firm-
clamped upon his nose his dog sprang
out and bounded ahead of him but lie


the vovulatr magazine

commanded him back sternly he
wanted no such herald to run to her
with the tidings of his coming

  peter had waited that day on the hill-
top to be ready it was a long ridge
running due north and south covered
with the scrubby growth of bush and
bramble after the general character of
that favored grazing land with wide
patches of open here and there be-
tween one fleet of foot could dodge
and hide there peter knew and play a
cunning game

  after a dash into the wind to the
first barrier of low-growing shrubs
peter checked himself to consider his
precipitate act it would be discon-
certing perhaps startling to a very un-
pleasant degree to burst out from cover
upon a young lady that way perhaps
she was altogether unaware of his pres-
ence in that locality maybe she was
a shepherdess over the hill there with
her flock it might be well to proceed
slowly and cautiously

  accordingly peter kept to cover and
went forward without noise his dog
behind him but prickling with eager-
ness to shoot off ahead and solve the
mystery for himself as his erect bris-
tles and forward-set ears attested

  the song broke and swelled by turns
as on the past days giving the im-
pression that the singer was riding fast
over furze and barren knoll hill hol-
low and open but peter seemed al-
ways as far away from it as at the
beginning although he forgot his res-
olution to be cautious more than once
and dashed like a hunter from cover
to cover the sweat streaming from his
unseasoned skin

  the pursuit of that elusive voice was
exasperating and doubly so to peter
now that he had arrived at the con-
clusion that it was a trick which some-
body apprised of his greenness to that
country and its customs was trying to
play him he resolved to run the singer
from her shelter if it took all day and

to that end he set aside all reserve of
nicety and gave the dog permission to
explore on his own account

 the song reached him now with
longer intervals of silence peter
pulled up panting and hot he did not
know how far from his starting place
and looked after the dog which
bounded away into the bushes and dis-
appeared peter was setting out after
him when the bushes beside him parted
with a crackle and a rasping over tough
clothing and a man burst out into the
little open

  he was a lank tall fellow with star-
ing eyes and hairy face dressed in
greasy khaki with a cap made from the
end of a blanket fragments of grass
and twigs clung to his coat as if he
had been wallowing on the ground

  hah its a mortal its a mortal
said he flinging his outstretched hands
to his sides in gesture of disappoint-
ment

 who was that singing asked
peter severely believing the herder was
one in the game

  sh-h-h  said the fellow cupping his
dirty hand to his dirtier ear leaning
on the wind and listening

  but the song was still it swelled
no more

  who was it demanded peter step-
ping out as if he meant to lay hands
on the herder and shake the truth out
of him

  a spirit said the man he drew
nearer leaned over and whispered
shes been singing here for a thou-
sand years its the voice of my lost
love

  he lifted his head like a startled
beast his hair-fringed lips open a wild
gleam in his bright vacant eyes bent
forward then like a racer and dashed
away into the bushes

  scarcely crediting the reality of the
situation peter pulled out his watch
and looked at the dial in dazed stare
half past four he had been gone an
the probation of p d



hour from the flock chasing that phan-
tom thing that fled before men and
wrenched their reason out of socket
leaving them staring and incoherent
like yon driveling fellow

  well the solution of it must be left
to another clay it was time now to be
getting back to the sheep and turning
them toward the bedding ground  the
hillside below his camp but which way
lay the long ridge where he had left
the sheep peter was then in a little
valley and in his recollection there lay
many hills which he had forged up and
dashed down in that mad pursuit

  it was with a stirring of panic in
his breast that he mounted the nearest
hill to get his bearings it seemed
hopeless to identify his ridge from
there many lay before him any one
of which might be his he recalled
in a cool moment that he had run into
the wind going with it then and fol-
lowing the trail that he had made when
possible would lead him back he laid
hold of his reason firmly and set out

  but it was dusk when he found the
flock the dog was there ahead of
him doubtless wondering in his saga-
cious sheep-dog way why his master
did not come to drive the sheep to their
temporary home the sheep seemed to
have gone through a fright from their
manner of drawing together and hud-
dling in groups but peter laid it to
nervousness due to the absence of the
commanding human force

  to-morrow-what of to-morrow if
the voice should come again and the
day after and always always on the
slanting wind what if he should never
be able to outdistance it never overtake
it never silence its cadence in his ears
again 

  to-morrow he remembered he must
drive the sheep to the river for water
what if the voice should follow trail-
ing after him in the sighing wind of
mid-afternoon what if it should haunt
him and set him seeking ever and ever
b

and drive him in the end to madness
and despair

chapter iii

lost sheep

  peter was abroad at dawm next morn-
ing haggard unrefreshed after a night
of phantom-plagued dreams the camp
mover came before he had gone far
 his easy-grazing way toward the
river with the news that the boss-
meaning carter-had given the word
that the herders were to remove their
flocks to the mountains for the summer
grazing within a few days

  he moved peters wagon to another
ridge two or three miles distant from
its first locatiop and went  his way
that day there was no song in the
wind nor the next peter felt back
in camp among the hills that he had
been the victim of somebodys trick
doubtless they were having their laugh
over his bewilderment and frantic hunt
and he should hear more of it to his
confusion in time

  it was the third day of peace after
his adventure with the voice that car-
ter came riding over the hills with his
daughter after the wolfhounds they
swept along the ridge toward peter
the lank great dogs loping ahead their
horses dodging in and out and leaping
over the clumped growths of brush-
wood and sage

  the young woman was mounted on
a long-necked chestnut horse almost as
delicate as herself in the lines of its
pure breeding carter waved his hand
in signal for peter to come forward

  this is the young man thats come
out here to put a kink of his own
in the sheep business said he in a
bantering way this is miss carter
but your names escaped me

  peter supplied it with blushes feeh
ing the incongruity of nose glasses and
sheep-herders raiment he saw that
she was smiling to him rather than at


the vovulatr magazine

him and offering her hand with in-
genuous frankness so he gave over try-
ing to smuggle his glasses into his
pocket and shook hands with her in
western cordiality

  i hope youll like it mr doster
and im sure youll succeed she said

  i think ill like it-im beginning
to like it said peter noting that her
hair was light as hemp fiber and that
it was blowing in very pretty confusion
over her cheeks and ears

  it must be lonesome for you out
here on the range just coming from
civilization although we think were as
much civilized as anybody if it comes
to that said she

  im sure you are peter agreed
warmly admiring the pliant grace of
her strong young body reposing in the
saddle with the ease of long schooling

  carter had been running his eye over
the grazing flock below meantime now
he spoke up sharply

  wheres the rest of them

  sir said peter not understanding
him in the least

  what have you divided the band
for dont you know theyre sure to
stray off and fall to the wolves if you
dont keep them all together under your
eyes 

  why i havent divided them
theyre all there protested the aston-
ished peter

  no theyre not all there said car-
ter you started out with a thousand
and you must be a third short whats
the matter with your eyes and your
judgment havent you noticed it
why no replied peter slowly his
heart sinking with the foreboding of
trouble and disgrace but i dont see
what could have become of them i

havent-

  he checked himself in time to save
stumbling over the precipice of one
gigantic fib he was about to say that
he hadnt left them to themselves since
taking charge

  well run em through that gap
down there i want to count em said
carter riding down to the lip of the
hill and taking a stand at the mouth
of the little valley in which the sheep
were feeding they streamed past him
slowly as peter and the dog turned
them and the flockmaster counted with
the quick eye of experience

  youre two hundred and seventy-
four short announced carter turning
in his saddle and looking at peter
severely that means about fifteen
hundred dollars the way ewes stand in
the market to-day

  oh thats too bad

  in his heart peter thanked miss car-
ter for her feeling words for her ac-
cent told that it was not the lost sheep
for which she felt but the losing shep-
herd the big wolfhounds had thrown
themselves down on the ground at her
horses feet where they lay panting
and unconcerned seeming to express
by their attitude a lofty indifference for
the sharp-faced collie which snarled at
them from peters side

  well what are you going to do
about it carter wanted to know

  peter bent his head in reflection
what indeed he felt trouble under
carters words as plainly as he felt
sympathy in the fair blue eyes of the
brown-clad girl beside him with her
cowboy hat and leggings and her tail-
ored riding suit

  i dont see what you were about to
let that many get away from you cen-
sured carter ive lost sheep before
but i never lost em in gobs like this
i think they went astray three days
ago said peter meeting his employers
angry eyes frankly i got turned
around and separated from them one
afternoon for about three hours and
when i found my way back i noticed
that they seemed disturbed and un-
easy

  well i expect a pack of wolves
scattered em said carter and well
the probation of p 



have to hustle out and find em before
theyre all killed where did that hap-
pen 

  peter gave him the location as well
as he could and carter directed his
daughter to ride in one direction while
he took another with the view of cover-
ing the territory into which the sheep
had strayed

  if you dont find any of em ride
back here to peters wagon and wait
for me he instructed riding off with
part of the hounds

  miss carter assembled the rest of
the dogs around her and took the oppo-
site direction as confident of herself
it seemed to peter as if she were riding
out on some simple social visit

  peter felt that he had cut a rather
lame figure in the matter it was plain
that carter blamed him severely and
held him to be an incompetent silly
greenhorn if not a hopeless case en-
tirely he kept asking himself what
could have happened to the sheep
three hundred or almost three hun-
dred had dropped out of sight as sud-
denly and completely as if the ground
had gaped and enveloped them what
relation could there have been between
their disappearance and the song that
lured him into that mad run across the
hills

  perhaps  relation at all but it was
a humiliating circumstance to recall
he decided that it would be best to say
nothing about the voice in the wind
that would only place him in a worse
light in his employers eyes perhaps
bring his sanity under suspicion

  peter gloomed the morning through
with anxious mind and anxious eyes
sweeping the great gray country around
him it seemed as empty as if carter
and his handsome daughter never had
ridden into it they had disappeared
as completely as the sheep

  it was past the turn of the day when
the young woman came back her mount
limping the dogs trailing after her

wearily the horse had turned its foot
in a hole miss carter said

  i was afraid id have to leave him
and walk back she said examining
the animals swollen hock with concern
hell never be able to carry me back
to the ranch to-day and the sprain will
be worse to-morrow ill have to take
fathers horse when he comes and send
somebody over after him

  did you see anything of the sheep
peter asked her

  not a trace she replied it beats
all how so many could sink out of sight
that way

  well its my fault and youve
ruined a good horse on top of the loss
of the sheep im afraid it never will
be able to carry you home or any-
where

  peter lifted the injured leg and ex-
amined it

  oh do you know horses why
i thought you were a college man

said she

  not the kind you have in mind
said peter how far is it to the
ranch 

  it must be nine or ten miles she
told him mother will be worried to
death-we just came up from our win-
ter home in cheyenne yesterday you
know and i was so anxious to get out
with the hounds i hardly slept last
night

  peter unsaddled the horse and turned
it loose standing burdened with the
saddle and bridle while he watched it
hobble away to graze with concerned
face

   it will have a stiff joint the cartilage
is hurt and the tendon torn said he

  well just to think that you know
about horses said she her surprise
outweighing her pity for the beast

  i was abotit to throw some dinner
together when you came in sight he
told her will you open a can of
beans with me

  will i well you watch me she


the pocpulacr magazine

returnee avidly you make the fire
and ill do the rest why itll be like
coming home to me

   you seem accustomed to the range
said peter

  ive wandered over it and camped
on it every summer since i was seven
and ill leave you to guess how long
-thats been she laughed

   i expect i could come nearer to it
than you think said peter

   yes ill bet you she said with a
little tilt of defiance

   peter was too wise to accept the chal-
lenge no matter what his own private
opinion of his guessing powers was
he kindled a little fire and she made
the coffee and they lunched very com-
fortably chattily and on the easiest
terms imaginable on the sunny side of
the wagon

  but her concern began to grow when
the shadows drew out toward evening
and carter did not return

  i hope he hasnt forgotten about
meeting me here and gone off home
she said and its clouding up too i
believe its going to rain

   peter made inquiry in regard to their
neighbors how near the closest one was
and whether he couldnt run across and
borrow a horse for her

   our ranch house is the nearest by
several miles she said mackinnons
ranch is north of here about fifteen or
twenty miles mackinnon and father
lease this land between them from
uncfe sam you know-and frisbie
brothers are over southwest of here
somewhere i dont know just where
theyre small growers the funniest
bunch of whiskerinos you ever saw
she laughed merrily over the frisbie
peculiarities so merrily and so lightly
unrestrained that peter must have bit-
ten his tongue to keep out of it

  theyre shearers she said and
two of them go away every spring to
follow the shearing leaving the oldest-
and lies no duckling either-to take

care of the place one of thems called
budge and hes the drollest-looking
genius you ever saw

  peter started at the mention of the
name

  tall said he and lanky like me
with long black hair that sticks out
straight behind him

  yes and greasy eyes she nodded
do you know budge 

  i met the gentleman  the train
coming up to vesper said peter im
afraid he doesnt approve of me in
fact he told me he didnt

  oh what a calamity she said
laughter in her eyes poor budge he
asked me to marry him once

  that fellow that bristled bar-
barian said peter feelingly

  sh-h-h you mustnt be jealous
she said holding up an admonishing
hand

  the rain came upon them in sharp
assault as they sat there and grew
friendly peter turned his snug wagon
over to his guest stowed her saddle
out of the rain beneath it and put on
his glaring new slicker and souwester
hat considered in conjunction with
those high-riding scholarly nose glasses
it was something of a rig indeed but
it fended against the driving rain which
was so cold and fierce as to send miss
carters disabled horse shivering to the
lee of the covered wagon where it
turned tail to the wind and waited

  peter got out with the sheep and
worked them around to the shelter of
the hill so the wind would blow over
them when they lay down for the night
it was thick dusk when he had them
quietly settled and returned to the
wagon

  carter had arrived peter found him
waiting at the tail of the wagon dressed
in the slicker which a ranchman never
leaves behind him but carries in sun
and shine in a roll behind the cantle
of his saddle if he had shown dis-
pleasure with peter on departing that
the cprcbatn of p d



morning to hunt the lost sheep he was
radiating suspicion in addition to it now

  it wasnt wolves young man and
you know it said he sternly i dont
know what kind of a game im up
against right now but it looks to me
like somebody run them sheep off
maybe you dont know anything about
it and maybe you do

  oh pa im sure mr doster isnt
to blame not in the least said a sweet
voice-sweet at least to peters ears in
that troubled moment-from the little
door in the wagon end

  children should be seen and not
heard miss marian if you please said
her father reprovingly let mr dos-
ter do his own talking if hes got any-
thing to say

  ive only got this to say right now
i dont like your intimations mr car-
ter said peter mildly

  well you can like it or lump it like
a dog does cold dumplins young fel-
ler returned carter hotly i said it
and it goes you came out here to this
country to make your start you said
well it looks to me like youre tryin
to make it too dam sudden

  the circumstances may look suspi-
cious admitted peter and even if i
didnt steal your sheep i was to blame
for allowing them to run away

  that dont mend matters said car-
ter gloomily what i want to know is
what do you propose to do about it
you said you came out here to make
good well i dont call this makin
good nor even a start in the right way
make good huh youll never make
good it aint in you to make good-in
a mans country

  peter never quibbled long over yes
or no in the small part that he had
carried thus far of lifes battle he had
been generally prepared and equipped
in school on the college farm in the
bank where he had worked for the live
years between times peter doster was

regarded as a young chap who pretty
well knew

  now he put his hand into the inside
pocket of his coat and brought out a
little sheaf of papers with a rubber
band about them miss carter had lit
the lantern and hung it out to pilot him
back to the wagon peter turned his
back to the wind and the light sepa-
rated a paper from among his bundle
and wrote his name across the back of
it with his fountain pen

  here is a certificate of deposit for
seven hundred dollars said he offering
it to carter on the first national
bank of vesper its all the money ive
got right now and it only covers about
half your loss on the sheep according
to your count and figures hold it as
security as far as it goes till i come
back with the sheep or the equivalent

  peter heard a little clapping of hands
above the slashing of rain against the
canvas wagon top and he chalked up a
wide score of gratitude in favor of miss
marian carter on the wall of his heart

  well all right peter said carter
considerably mollified by the swift turn
of affairs

  he took the proffered collateral and
put it in his wallet but peter said no
more even while carter was tugging
at the stiff buttons of his slicker to put
the wallet away in his pocket peter
turned up the collar of his bright new
yellow coat down which the rain in
rivulets glistened in the lantern light
turned his back on carter and the
wagon and the blue-eyed friend within
it and walked away into the storm and
the night

chapter iv

taking out tiie brand

  peter was not aware of his melodra-
matic exit for it was far from his in-
tention to lend that color to it he was
in sober earnest about finding carters
lost sheep big as the country was it


the popular magazine

could not have absorbed them hide and
wool in three days

  the night was thick the rain inces-
sant but peter was in such a turmoil
of mind that he tramped up hill and
down dale with his face turned toward
the storm unfeelingly carters charge
that he had a hand in the disappearance
of the sheep troubled him and the blunt
declaration of the flockmaster that he
peter doster agronomist never would
make good in a mans country made his
slow blood hot

  but peter reached the sane conclu-
sion after beating into the storm he
knew not how many hours that there
was nothing to be gained by groping
about that way in the dark better to
get his back against a dry ledge some-
where-and there were plenty of them
-make a fire and settle down to wait
for dawn done accordingly already
peter was becoming handy in the range
craft of making a fire out of unprom-
ising materials and the warmth and
light of his blaze were welcome in that
raw wet night

  since the day of his adventure in
pursuit of the mysterious voice peter
had been sharpening his eyes in the mat-
ter of landmarks he had settled in his
own determination that he never would
go astray on that range again now
after a slow drowsing and weary wait
when the dawn broke like muddy water
he found himself by the marks which
he had set in his mind upon the hills

  he was not far from the spot where
the wild shepherd had broken from the
brush that day of the mad run after
the voice again the question rose be-
fore him what connection could there
have been between the singer and the
sheep what magic was there in that
sound that could whisk away two hun-
dred and seventy-four animals as com-
pletely as if they had dissolved

  perhaps no relation at all said he
and the daft shepherd was he what
he seemed or one of a band of thieves

who had worked damage to his flock
while he had been lured away it
seemed impossible to peter that this
could have been so the man bore
all the marks of madness yet there
was something in the circumstance of
the singing and the segregation of his
flock that could not be put aside

  the wind had blown from the south
that day peter recalled a point per-
haps to the west the singers voice
had faded out into the source of the
wind let his first investigation lead
in that direction and see what might
develop

  the rain had ceased and a west wind
was moving rolling up the dun cloud
curtain from a sky as blue and warm
as somebodys eyes remembered with
what quick leaping of the heart peter
blushed to own for it would not do
to capitulate weakly to the first pair
of lively eyes that came along a man
might consider it after he had made
good but at that hour of the may morn-
ing with his affairs all in the wind like
hay in a storm-swept meadow it would
not be the thing to admit into his life

  whatever chance of tracking the lost
animals there had existed before the
storm was now lost besides that mar-
ian-how easily the name came on the
tongue of his thoughts and how sweet
-had told him that mackinnons flocks
grazed that range in common with her
fathers tracking in that case would
be a useless thing he must forge
ahead and flounder more or less ex-
plore the country thoroughly and as
quickly as might be he believed that
he could go into a band of sheep and
pick out his missing animals anywhere
even though the crude c branded
from a wooden die in black paint upon
their shorn coats had been sheared
away

  he held his course a little west of
south and went forward with many
pauses on hilltops to explore the coun-
try lying around him and a few fruit-
the cprcbatn of p d



less excursions to one side and another
after the false lure of white rocks
among the gray sage the day had
turned when he came with abruptness
almost startling upon a small ranch at
the peak of a snug little valley already
greening over with fresh grass

  there was the vigor of summer in
the sun long since it had persuaded
the slicker from peters back and it
was hot now and drawing out a smell
of linseed oil on the seaman-looking
souwester which sat as tight as a crow
on its nest to the crown of his head
peter stopped and looked down on the
sheep corral made of close-woven wil-
low wattles the thatched fold and log
house a bleached elk skull mounted
by tall antlers rode the end of the house
ridgepole the thick brown thatch of
the long low dwelling came down close
to the ground

  there were sheep in the corral which
was cross-fenced and cut curiously into
pens peter thought for a drovers fold
yard but about the place there seemed
to be no human presence peter felt
that he might go down and claim the
hospitality of the ranch after the free
and friendly custom which he had heard
-by reading magazines back east-
prevailed in that land

  no smoke came from the short mud-
daubed chimney to cheer his hope of a
meal no sound save the shuffling of
the feet of the sheep in the pens rose
around the quiet place a collie came
bristling around the corner of the sheep
sheds suddenly as peter advanced he
spoke to it and it came cautiously to
meet him sniffing the friendly smell
of sheep which lie bore its bristling
hair lay smooth with that identification
of a fellow craftsman and the dog fell
in behind him with friendly signals of
its bur-matted tail

  under foot the ground was soft to-
gether with the rain of last night and
the cutting of sheeps hoofs and peter
turned the corner of the corral and

sheds silently there he stopped his
breath hanging in his throat like smoke
in a chimney checked by a quick down-
draft

  the pens were filled with sheep many
of which bore the carter brand and
others a queer crude monogram of the
letters m and k a giant-statured man
whose black beard and long hair were
sprinkled with gray was working
among them in one of the sheds his
blue flannel shirt was open at the neck
and rolled up from his thick hairy
arms and he was so intent on the task
ahead of him that he did not even no-
tice the shrinking and drawing away
from the fence among the sheep as
peter drew near

  peter approached cautiously now and
stood at the fcncc not a rod distant
from the busy drover the big man
opened the gate of the small pen at his
hand laid hold of a sheep and pulled
it out peter saw that it was one of
carters the brand being fresh and clear
after the washing in the rain

  the drover sat the animal upon its
haunches between his knees like a
shearer while he dipped a big sponge
in a bucket on a bench near at hand
this he rubbed upon the brand which
to peters astonished gaze faded out
like a chalk mark from a board then
the fellow dried the wool with a cloth
and struck another brand a big f
where the carter c had stood this
done he took up a handful of dust and
threw it over the white spot in the short
fleece which his brand-removing mix-
ture had made and turned a carter
sheep into a perfectly good frisbie one
-as peter suspected-in less than two
minutes time

  peters astonishment was like a bit in
his mouth he never had heard of a
thing like that and his surprise was loo
great to permit speech offhand he
stood and watched the man at his scoun-
drelly job the friendly collie sniffing his
leg on terms of perfect equality


the popular magazine

  there were but a few sheep left in
the corral waiting the obliteration of
their brands most of them having been
treated but the brown-legged south-
downs belonging to carter were easily
picked out in spite of their changed
marks the big sheepman reached into
the pen and pulled out another ewe
peter ran his eye over the remainder
which bore their original brands and
counted seven of carters only soon
the last evidence that could stand in law
would be removed

  peter moved quietly along the fence
until he reached a point from where he
could almost lean over and touch the
brand remover in the bucket by the
sheepmans side

  thats an interesting process said
he

  the sheepman whirled round the
dripping sponge in his clutch and the
ewe released from the clamp of his
big knees scrambled to her feet and
away peter saw the fellows whis-
kered scowling visage noted his dark
greasy skin his flat twisted nose with
heavy eyebrows meeting above it and
thought he looked fit for the job

  ill trouble you to cut out those two
hundred and seventy-four southdowns
of carters and run them out here to
me ive come after them said peter
unmoved by the surprised ferocity in
the mans ugly face

  quick as thought the sheepman
stooped and came up with a fence stake
in his hand instinctively peter cow-
ered from the blow shrinking behind
the flimsy fence for the man moved
with bewildering rapidity allowing no
time for leaping back or aside peter
was conscious of that one weak effort
on his part to shield his defenseless
head against the blow that and no
more

    rut nie and my true love
    will never meet again

    on the bonny bon-ny banks
    o loch lomond

  peter heard the words dimly with-
out the ability to account for either them
or himself he was put to a struggle
even to move his eyelids which seemed
weighted with shot and the summons
from brain to muscle for the lifting of
his hand resulted in no more than a
vague half-felt straining of tendons
his mind persisted in placing him on
the range back in the afternoon of his
blind run after that same melody
against reason and his own sense of
fitness

  subconsciously his faculties seemed
to work out of his control entirely al-
though a weak protest struggled within
him against such surrender dimly he
knew that this time was not that other
day and this place not the range where
carters sheep fed now he became
conscious of a swelling pain in his head
which welled and eased welled and
eased like the beating of a heart it
seemed that his head must be divided
and that the two parts advanced and re-
ceded in a vain effort to reunite out
of this thought the fantastic idea came
to him that each side was thinking for
itself and that he had lost control of the
center and had become nothing more
than a silent third party

  he seemed to be in darkness there
was no consciousness of light such as
one feels through closed eyelids and
the singing voice seemed far away it
was immaterial anyway thought peter
in his third-party capacity let the tan-
gle run its length in due time illumi-
nation would come but if the two
halves of his head could be brought to-
gether and bound about with an iron
band such as blacksmiths shrink upon
wagon hubs thought lie it would be a
very comfortable arrangement

 his weak mind ran off on that
thought of the iron ring from a wagon
hub and the desirability of having one
persisting in it to troublesome and un-
reasonable length he could not put the
strange notion aside although it wor-
the cpcrocbation of p 



ried him like the droning of an insect
in a sleepless night

  his arm obeyed die summons to move
at last his weak explorations discov-
ered that on one side of him was a wall
near which he lay sheepskins beneath
him blankets over him but time
seemed to have stopped for him on the
afternoon that he set out to overtake
the singing voice and to have resumed
again with the impression of a divided
head all that had gone between if
there had been anything between in-
deed was lost

  that mattered very little thought
peter the one thing to be thought of
now was the iron ring made broad
with a bevel for the forehead to pre-
vent chafing he wished that he could
get up from there and go out in the
sun to think it over out of the reach
of that singing voice which persisted
in his ears

    but me and my true love
    will nev-er-r meet a-gain-

  there it was as lonely sounding as
the wind at night as low yearning as a
widows wail and there was no light
where peter lay-nothing to tell him
whether it was day or night

  a door opened peter could not com-
mand the machinery which turned his
head it would not answer but there
was a sense of light with the sound of
the opening door imaginary perhaps
said peter ready to take himself up on
trifles and argue it out to the last ex-
cuse

  some one had entered and seemed to
be listening near the door now a cool
hand was on his forehead stroking back
his hair peter opened his heavy lids
but there was murkiness around him
he could not see the owner of the hand

  oh youre awake are you  said a
voice close by his side

  peter was clearing out of the fog
now and he was surprised to hear him-
self reply weakly and request a drink
of water

  almost immediately a spoon was
placed between his lips he drank sip-
ping eagerly in wavering outline he
could see his nurse when she passed
across the beam of light which fell in
from the room beyond the notion of
the iron ring still possessed him but
she never could help him to it he told
himself nobody but a blacksmith
could do it properly but she might be
able to alleviate his suffering and un-
rest in another way

  if you could bind the two together
with a band of cloth or maybe a strap
he suggested in weak appeal

  what did you say honey she
asked coming quickly to his pallet of
sheepskins kneeling at his side her
cool refreshing hand on his forehead
again

  i thought maybe it would help-
maybe a towel or something would do
said he

  do forwhat honey she asked
with gentle eagerness

  to bind the two pieces together i

mean- no  it cant be that im

raving

  if i knew what it was you wanted
id do anything to get it for you said
she

  i imagined in my sleep a little while
ago that my head was split in two said
peter his scattered senses converging
like jackstraws to a magnet and i
think i was trying to ask you to tie
something around it to hold it together

  poor lad said she a shake in her
voice as if tears were not far distant

  she hurried away returning almost
at once it seemed to peter with a cold
towel which she bound around his beat-
ing head the relief was great almost
immeasurable he thanked her won-
dering what made his pain yet lacking
the force of initiative to inquire about
it now

  heres some broth-its made out of
marrowbones she said putting the
spoon to his lips again i knew youd


the popular magazine

need it when you got clear again so i
put it on early its the best thing in
the world to make strength and you
must take it down no matter if you do
feel a little squirmy in the insides of
you

  peter noticed something strange
about her in accent and manner which
set him thinking that she must be a
foreigner how was it he puzzled that
he came to be in a foreign place never
to his recollection having gone abroad

  where am i and whats the matter
with me he asked her struggling to
lift himself to his elbow

  she pushed him back to his bed gen-
tly he could see her quite plainly now
she shook her head admonishing quiet

  keep your strength for to-morrow
lad youll need it-well both need it
then said she

chapter v

a winsome rogue

  whether through the virtue of the
marrowbone broth or his own powers
of recuperation peter woke refreshed
the phantoms of his first awakening
had vanished the throbbing pains were
gone out of his head only there was
a heaviness in him which lay upon every
limb and on the side of his head above
his left ear there was a sore lump where
the sheepmans club had found its aim

  lying there on his pallet peter re-
called the circumstances of his disable-
ment it was only unexplained to him
now why the thieving ruffian had not
made away with him entirely as it
was he seefned to be shut in a small
room underground it was stone-walled
cement-floored and light and ventilation
were provided by one little window set
in an embrasure in the thick wall it
was not more than eighteen inches in
height six inches wide and blocked in
addition by a vertical iron bar

  the little window was hinged and it
stood open but too far above his head

to give him even a glimpse of the outer
surroundings light enough came
through the little slit to show him that
the compartment which he occupied was
used for storing potatoes and boxes of
canned goods and miscellaneous arti-
cles such as lanterns and hoes a scythe
depending from a spike in the sill over-
head and sheep shears swinging by it on
a thick string

  peter tried sitting up wondering
what had become of his nurse there
was more strength in him than he had
hoped to find even his legs bore him
without faltering although he seemed
by reason of the bruise on his head to
be at least a foot taller than his usual
stature

  the door which had stood open last
night while the young woman gave him
water and broth was closed now peter
tapped on it there followed a quick
sound as of some one rising beyond
a quick step and she stood before him

  she was a young woman slender
small her face was sadly sweet as
from longings and hardships her large
gray eyes were serious and grave she
was soberly garbed in a gray woolen
dress with a white something like a
neckerchief tucked into her bosom
her hair lay thick upon her white fore-
head black as a night cloud rippled
like wave-marked sand

  i was sitting as tight as a mouse
said she with no gleam of a smile on
lips or eyes for i wanted you to have
your sleep out and rise strong how
do you feel by now

  better almost right again thanks to
your kind nursing said peter steady-
ing himself by laying a hand against
the jamb

  no youre not very strong yet it
was a fearful blow he laid on you lad
-a fearful cowardly cruel blow

  her eyes kindled with angry flash
her voice shook with emotion as she de-
nounced the cowardly attack
the txrobation of p d



 who is he-where is he now 
asked peter

  angus frisbie he is the woman-
killer hes gone away to sell the sheep
that he stole from you and others with
my help sorrow to my day

  is this his house  asked peter then
not giving her time to reply of course
theres no other i must go after him
-i cant allow him to get away with the
sheep-and you dont want him to
either i know

  no but you cant go i cant go
were locked in this walled cellar and
theres no gettin out

  well i dont understand it-not
yet said peter in bewilderment

  its thought that maybe youre
dead said she or if alive safe and
silent to put out of the way by and by
it was the first time that he was ever
caught said angus and it would be the
last he blames me for it i was on
watch and failed to see you pass he
killed the dog for failin to warn him
and maybe hell kill me when he comes
home i dont know-its in him to
do it

  she spoke bitterly but withal hope-
lessly as if it mattered little whether
angus frisbie should spend his wrath
upon her when he returned she went
in her quick sudden starting way to a
gasoline stove where a kettle was boil-
ing and turned down the flame

  come in and well have some break-
fast and then you can rest the morning
out and well see if anything can be
done it will be four days before an-
gus comes back

  and so you are the one that sang
said he

  it was a sore day for me when i
began it said she shaking her head
gravely in the beginnin i didnt know
it was thievin and when i found that
it was angus wouldnt let me stop i
was as deep in the mud he said as he
was-and budge and james-in the
mire ive been a rogue against my will

honey but who is there to believe that
of me now

  she poured coffee for him and turned
an egg into the pan

  tell me about it he requested
gravely amused by her manner of treat-
ing him as if he were a child

  she went to the cupboard and came
back with his eyeglasses between linger
and thumb holding them with conspicu-
ous care

  they were dingin to you still
hooked behind your ear by the little
gold chain when angus carried you in
and threw you there said she nodding
toward the inner room

  its a marvel how they escaped
said he

  it is she nodded marvelous like
many frail things that meet the perils
of this world and come out at last
shaken but whole

  peter lifted his serious young face
and looked across the table at her where
she had seated herself her bare arms
crossed before her on the cloth there
was a world of unspoken meaning in her
words which her grave face and lonely
eyes made plainer

  but why did you sing that way he
asked her feeling that sympathy must
be reserved

  angus frisbie is my mothers hus-
band not my father said she to begin
at the beginning he brought us over
from scotland when i was a lass of
fifteen and five years of life under the
hard hand and the harder heart of
angus sent her to the grave her heavy
burden came down to me it has made
me old before my day

  the frisbie men are all rascals and
have been always and angus is the
greatest rogue of them all the steal-
ing of sheep has been going on a long
time even before we came they had
been at it taking them by twos fives
tens-lambs mainly at the beginning-
from their neighbors flocks so few
never were missed i came to help an-


the popular magazine

gus at his trade in innocence not know-
ing what i was about

  in summer when james and budge
are off in the north following the shear-
ing into canada i help angus with the
sheep on the range such times i used
to sing to break the loneliness one
day angus came to me his face black
with anger and told me that mackin-
nons men had been stealing our sheep
just across the hill said he daft john
as we call him a broken-minded man
who once worked for angus was run-
ning a band with our stolen beasts
among them

  angus had promised me long to give
me the passage money back to glasgow
and now he said the very sheep that he
was counting on to provide it had been
stolen out of our hands i was furious
against thieves-as i believed them then
to be-and said i would go myself and
drive our beasts away

  no it was  work for a woman
angus said leave it to him but i
could help him if i would but stay on
the hilltop above daft johns flock and
sing the song loch lomond

   when you sing that song said an-
gus daft john goes mooning up the
hill to lie in the bush and listen i have
seen him at it more than once so
angus proposed to me that i go near
daft johns flock and sing and when
he left the sheep to listen lead him
away by skipping from bush to bush
from hill to hill  then he could go in
freely and drive home our sheep without
interference from daft john and i
should have my passage money home
so the thing was done and i laughed
over it and was light at heart in the
hope of going home away from this
bleak land forever it was sport to
lure  poor daft johnny for i am
nimble on the foot as a hare and from
bush to bush i can go like a shadow
keeping out of sight

  so you can said peter giving her
full credit for her cunning

  but once you almost found me
said she on that last day it was when
you came with the dog the collie
caught me and you would have too i f
you had followed him but i must tell
you how i was led on to become a thief
it was almost three years ago that we
played that trick on daft john and
angus stole almost a hundred sheep
from under his eyes when angus told
me that we had robbed mackinnon i
fell sad and was ashamed i said he
must give back the sheep but he
laughed in my face and said it was only
the beginning i was smirched now
and if found out i would go to prison
with him i must help him play the
same trick on other dull shepherds and
in the fall i should have my passage
money home there was no other hope
of having it he said

  i refused him a long time and then
the home hunger drove me to help him
lure away one of carters men who was
herding above three thousand sheep lie
was a raw green lad like you only not
bright as you are and he was afraid
when he heard me singing above him
on the hill and ran the other way but
not far enough for angus so on the
next day we tried again with success
angus drove away thirty from the flock
the loss was not discovered but the
herder fell sick from the fright and
another came in his place a wise one
too sharp for angus to try to deceive

  next summer after that we played
the same game twice on daft john and
brought away ninety all told then
nothing more was done until you came
between you and daft john this time
angus came away with nearly four hun-
dred sheep you saw how he took the
brands out of the wool and put on our
own he has mixed them with five
hundred ewes of our own and is on the
way to vesper now to load them in
cars and ship them to omaha

so that was the way you worked it
said peter feeling very small indeed in
the prbatn of p d



the face of this ingenuous revelation
well angus is a bold one to go driv-
ing them to vesper to load

  he is a bold one and always was
and in his boldness is his safety said
she nobody would suspect that he
had stolen half the sheep-maybe more
-that he is driving so openly to mar-
ket that is not the way of a thief
no it isnt the usual way said
peter

  budge and james are at vesper
shearing in delfinders sheds she said
they will have the cars ordered and
waiting and one of them will go on to
omaha with the sheep angus will
come home to put you out of the way
-bury you if he finds you dead kill
you if he finds you living that is what
lie told me when he left he threw you
here being in a hurry to leave with
the sheep for he was a day late already
and had no time to make a grave
well hell not make a grave for me
just yet declared peter resolutely ris-
ing from the table he felt much
strengthened by his meal and the sick-
ness which he took for indication of a
fractured skull was gone only that
sense of being abnormally tall remained
and it was exceedingly awkward

  the walls are stone and the win-
dows  bigger than a hand said she
over our heads there is a trapdoor of
two-inch oak locked with two padlocks
the scythe hanging yonder is the heavi-
est tool in the cellar and i wonder that
angus overlooked it but you cant
cut your way out with it

  do you think hell be gone four days
-whos looking after the sheep that he
left behind he asked

  angus tramped the ricks full of hay
and shut them in the corral she said
theyll not want till he comes

  peter did not feel that there was any
reason to distrust her after her friendly
services if she had wished him harm
she could have wrought it while he lay
helpless

  what will he do with you he
asked

  its in the man to kill me but hell
hardly do that-hes saving me for
worse said she bitterly he wants
to marry me she explained in answer
to his startled look hes been pressin
me to marry him these four years and
more

  i see nodded peter considering
many things

  and janies does likewise said she
between the two wolves i have been
safe for each of them has watched the
other but for that-

  she shuddered her sad young face
grew pale no there was no room for
distrusting her peter knew that now
beyond the farthest doubt

  ill get you out of here away from
the wolves said he

  she came around the table to him
in her impetuous way of moving even
to do little things and laid her hand on
his arm

  what is your name she asked

  he told her she repeated it as if
it carried a recollection

  peter doster-it has a scottish
sound she said

  and scottish affiliation he told her
you will not think less of me for
that

  for the first time now he saw her
smile it was so sadly sweet revealing
such unexpected charm in her melan-
choly face that his heart quickened to
her surely thought peter a thing so
beautiful must be bestowed only on fa-
vored ones and then as rarely as solar
eclipse

  my name is constance reed i was
studying to become a teacher in the
public schools at home when mother
yielded to this mans call and came
said she it has been my hope to go
back and-

  tears in her eyes finished what her
faltering voice could not complete the
sadness of that long hope smote peter


the pocpular magazine

with a pang as keen almost as if it had
been his own

  you shall go back said he it was
foolish of that thieving scoundrel to
think that he could pen two people up
in a little old hole like this and come
back at his pleasure and find them wait-
ing him like the sheep in his corral

  but investigation proved to him that
angus frisbie was not so foolish as
might seem the walls were solid ma-
sonry the floor of the rooms above was
oak a straight crude stairway little
more than a ladder led down to the cel-
lar and above it lay the trapdoor which
constance had described besides the
scythe the sheep shears the few table
knives and forks there was  tool nor
implement at hand these seemed alike
worthless against the walls and heavy
planks

  it appeared indeed that angus had
planned and built against that day
doubtless the man and his wild broth-
ers had other secrets hidden in that
thick-walled place or if not so they
had prepared it for the sequestration
of mysteries and unlawful deeds

  if he could tear the stairs apart and
use one of the heavy side planks for
a battering-ram against the floor
thought peter he might spring it and at
length make a hole but that was out
of consideration the upper ends of the
planks were nailed against a sill the
lower set into the cement of the floor
even if he had a crowbar he still
wanted the strength to wield it anyhow
so peter turned his eyqs and his
thoughts to other things

  can you think of  way out pe-
ter she asked as he stood in cogita-
tive pose after turning over everything
in the place there was a note of anx-
ious appeal in her voice as if she had
placed everything in his hands and
looked to him now to work for both of
them

  yes one way and one only said

he are you ready to risk a great deal
-everything--on the chance

  my life said she quietly raising
her cool gray eyes to his

  it may come to that he told her
we must burn a hole in the floor big
enough for you to get through-it will
not take nearly as big a one as it would
for me-and then you can break the
locks off the trapdoor with an ax and
let me out

  it sounds very simple i wonder why
i didnt think of it she said

  still not so simple as it may sound
first we must have a hole in the floor
for a draft or tlr smoke will smother
us in this close place we couldnt burn
a hole in that oak floor in a day without
a vent anyhow but ive got that fig-
ured out the points this the fire
may set something in the room over-
head and run to the roof in that case
wed roast long before we could burn
our hole big enough to get through
theres where the risk lies do you
want to take it

  its no greater than the risk of meet-
ing angus when he comes said she
he never intends that you shall leave
here alive knowing what you know

  it will make a fearful smoke-sup-
pose that angus sees it and rides back 
hell not be able to leave the sheep
-hes alone said she

  all right well get to work light
your gasoline stove

  peter brought the sheep shears from
the inner room where he had lain and
thrust them into the hot blue flame of
the little stove

  now show me a place where theres
no bed no other furniture or rug on the
floor he requested

  there are no rugs only a sheepskin
here and there on the floor and right
about here is the middle of the big
room not a thing in reach she said
pointing out the spot

  peter stood  a box the red-hot
shears in hand and began the slow and
the ovation of cp d



laborious task of burning a venthole
through the floor it was fully two
hours before peter by boring and twist-
ing with his heated primitive tool had
a hole an inch and a half in diameter
through the thick boards

  now well soak them with coal oil
and touch them off and stand by with
a bucket of water to put it out when its
gone far enough said he if all goes
well well be out of here in a little
while

leaving out a luxury

a green congressman elected to frame the laws and help control the des-
tinies of this nation arrived in washington several weeks ago to engage
an apartment for the session beginning next december he was bluff blunt
and a bachelor and he was searching for a small apartment so that he might
save money out of his salary

     after visiting many hotels and apartment houses without finding the price
he desired he struck a swell place on connecticut avenue

    these apartments are small enough he told the manager who was show-
ing him through the house but they cost too much

    i have a smaller one and cheaper one on the top floor the manager ex-
plained making one more attempt to hook the customer

     they adjourned to the smaller and cheaper

     the only trouble is the manager said hesitantly that there is no bath
in this apartment

    oh commented the green congressman carelessly that makes no differ-
ence to me im going to be here only four months

a long career

cixty-one years in the railroad business is the record of edward t jeffery
who has the reputation of being the hardest-working man in wall street
he is seventy-two years old and has never been known to take a vacation for
years he has worked in the gould offices even on holidays in fact he loves work
as another man loves pleasures

     the railroad once known as a streak of rust through a desert the denver
 rio grande was developed by mr jeffery into a great property the mans
career is remarkable as an office boy in the illinois central in  beginning
with the duty of blacking the boots of the superintendent of machinery mr
jeffery gradually rose to the presidency of the gould railway and is now chairman
of the board of the denver road

     mr jeffery is george j goulds closest financial associate and chief adviser
there is probably  other man in the world for whom mr gould has a deeper
affection or in whom he places greater confidence

and his control was something that
made every man who had ever caught
him rejoice his catchers didnt get
sore hands they didnt strain them-
selves leaping for the occasional wild
ones that any pitcher has a right to
deliver for megrue put every ball
exactly where the signal called for it

  yet every manager in the league
shook his head wisely when dan
fetherston who was serving his first
year as a manager refused to waive
on megrue they were sorry for him
and there was a reason for this of
course three of those same managers
had tried to handle megrue lloyd of
the brewers had kept him a full year
and when he gave up it seemed cer-
tain that megrue for all his skill was
bound for the bottom of the baseball
ladder

  the explanation simple enough
tragically simple in fact megrue
loved baseball he lived for it but
he loved something else even better
something that he poured from a bot-

tle every one knew it dan fether-
ston had been warned but he had
smiled and said he was willing to
take a chance so larry megrue a
little frightened because he knew how
near he had come to dropping out of
the big leagues altogether came to the
turks and reported to fetherston

  hello larry said dan in the club-
house you look fine feel like pitch-
ing some real ball for us

  sure said larry with an uneasy
defiance he was twenty-two years old
at this time his skin was like a babys
his eyes were clear if one had not
known his weakness one would never
have suspected it he could still throw
off the effects of a bout with john bar-
leycorn of course and in the intervals
of his drinking lie showed none of the
marks that would come later 

 good enough said dan you
know what youre up against dont
you the turks wont give you the
sort of hitting you had with the brew-
ers behind you and we havent got
their fielding either not yet but
im hoping well have a team before i
get through

  youve got a real pitcher now any-
how said larry encouragingly

  it sounds rather ridiculous but he
really didnt say that boastfully he
knew how good he was thats all it
would have been strange if he had not
it had been dinned into his ears often
it can be done



enough for the last two and a half
years

  yep said fetherston without a
smile thats why i wouldnt waive
on you

  the color flamed red in larrys
cheeks at that he couldnt get over
the idea that waivers had actually been
asked on him-and that only dan
fetherston had refused to let him slip
out of fast company true two teams
before the brewers had decided that
even his pitching wasnt enough to off-
set his drinking but each of them
had used him in a trade that flattered
his pride they had obtained stars of
recognized worth when they parted
with him this last affair though was
humiliating in the extreme none of
the other teams had wanted him at any
price-except the turks

  i got you dan he said rather
huskily ill show them other suckers
where they get off thinkin im all in 
the stiffs ill help you put the turks
up in the first division

  he could do it too-if- but it

was an awfully big if he had the
skill and the courage in his right
senses with his foot on the mound and
his arm right he could have beaten
the best ball club in the world with a
high-school team behind him

  thats what im expecting you to
do larry said his new manager so-
berly the rest of the managers think
youre all in they think youre
through-

  just because i take a drink now an
then megrue broke in he looked
at fetherston and saw the faintest
shadow of a smile in the managers
eyes his own eyes fell well-
maybe i dont stop at just one when
i get started he admitted

  fetherston said nothing megrue
was evidently expecting a sermon he
had listened to one when he joined his
new team on both the previous occa-
sions when he had been transferred

  b

and each time he had promised to re-
form and be good too fetherstons
silence rather puzzled him it was an
altogether friendly face that he saw
but he saw something inscrutable in it
too as if fetherston was thinking
many things he preferred to keep to
himself

  i cant help it megrue broke out
ive got to have the stuff when i get
to feeling that way i dont drink all
the time-just once in a while and
it dont hurt me any im as good as
i ever was

  sure you are dont feel it a bit
do you

  not a little bit thats what makes
me sore they tell me itll hurt my
pitching but it never has im bet-
ter now than i was two years ago
before i started drinking at all

  well youll get all the chance there
is to show me that said fetherston
ill expect you to work twice a week
i dont know that its any of my busi-
ness what you do when youre not in
uniform

  this was rank heresy fetherston
was betraying his managerial office
and it wasnt true anyhow every-
thing a ball player does on or off the
field is of concern to his manager be-
cause it all affects his playing sooner
or later but fetherston was playing
a deep game and those of his rival
managers who knew him well would
not have judged him too hastily for
that seemingly insane remark they
had seen him do things ihat looked
foolish but were exceedingly wise

  certainly in the beginning it looked
as if fetherston had made a wise move
when he refused to let megrue go
larry was on his very best behavior
and he played classy ball he was an
inspiration to the turks when he was
in the box they were assured of good
pitching and that made them play
rather better than their average by
arousing the spirit of emulation


the popular magazine

  as for larry he was out for re-
venge he wanted to make every man-
ager who had waived claim to him re-
alize his mistake so for a month his
passion for baseball absorbed him to
the exclusion of his other passion

  lloyd watched him shut the brewers
out with regretful eyes and after the
game spoke to fetherston about it

  the greatest pitcher i ever saw
he said with a sigh if hed only let
the stuff alone-the fool kid but
youre taking an awful chance dan
in the old days a boozing ball player
could get by for a while but not
any more its a rotten bad example
for the others

  he hasnt taken a drink since he
joined us said fetherston as he
spoke he looked around for a piece of
wood and struck it sharply ive got
my fingers crossed too he added with
a smile

  youll need moren that to keep him
straight laughed lloyd i figured
hed walk a chalk line for a while after
you got him-the scare he got when
he thought he was going to the minors
sort of cinched that and i suppose
you talked to him like a dutch uncle
too say dan-if id had another year
of making speeches to that nut id be a
better speaker than william jennings
bryan

  i havent said a word to him about
it though i listened some said fether-
ston truthfully talking wouldnt do
much good

  lloyd looked at him sharply

  i guess youre right he admitted
a gatling gun would be more like it
but theres a sort of comfort in telling
him what you think of him once in a
while

  i dont know maybe thats one
reason hes gone so far i wonder if
he hasnt been talked to too much

  to this since there was obviously no
answer that would not be offensive
lloyd replied only with a whistle of

astonishment he had meant to give
dan fetherston who still had many
things to learn about the fine art of
managing a club some friendly advice
now he abandoned the idea and offered
his team a bonus of new suits if it beat
megrue in the last game of the series
he didnt have to hand out any orders
for those suits though megrue rose
to the highest levels of baseball fame
in that game he shut the brewers out
without a run or a hit and he didnt
let a man reach first base

  after all that was a pretty good ex-
cuse for a celebration it seemed so
to megrue and to certain foolish well-
wishers who knew his fondness for a
drink as usual he didnt stop at one
drink or two or three and when he
finally went home he didnt even know
that fetherston was walking on the
opposite side of the street he wouldnt
have cared if he had known

  this was the beginning of the end
larry proceeded to make up for his
month of abstinence thinking that he
had a manager at last who was reason-
able and would close his eyes to his
celebration if only he were fit for duty
on the days when he was likely to pitch
larry grew careless he didnt try
to get up in time for morning practice
on the days that succeeded his festive
evenings and fetherston said not a
word seemingly he ignored larrys
backsliding

  so it was not managerial reproaches
that marked the beginning of the end
of megrues stay with the turks as
had been the case when he had begun
to fall from grace with his other clubs
it was something infinitely worse for
suddenly and without any cause that he
himself could discern his arm lost its
cunning he felt strong his eye was
clear his complexion retained the ruddy
glow of health it seemed to him that
he was putting as much stuff on the
ball as he had ever done and yet
in four consecutive games he suffered
it can bb done



the keenest humiliation that had ever
come to him he was hit harder than
he had ever been since he first faced
professional batters in his first minor-
league engagement teams he had al-
ways been able to beat with his glove
and a prayer as the saying goes as-
sailed him as if he had been the veriest
tyro men who had been lucky to get
half a dozen hits off him in a season
drove home three or four blows in a
single game

  in the fourth of these games came
the worst blow of all con martin of
the reds was at bat con was a great
pitcher but he was probably the feeb-
lest batter that ever stood at the plate
when he got a hit it was first-page
news this season he had still when
he faced larry to make his first safe
drive and now he hit one of larrys
choicest curves into the right-field stand
for a home run-the first and the last
that he ever made it broke larrys
heart and after the game he went to
his brother pitcher and spoke as man
to man

  con he said almost tearfully
youre a grand pitcher youre the
only man in this league can come in
my class but you never got a hit off
me before tell me how you straight-
ened out that curve

  why-uh-i dknow larry fal-
tered con appreciating his feelings
curve you say it wasnt a curve
she never broke at all i just swung
and the first thing i knew she was in
the stand you wasnt a bit more sur-
prised than i was

  larry went away shaking his head
it was the first time his curve hadnt
broken something was dreadfully
wrong he needed consolation-and
sought it in a bottle

  he kept on losing games there
were no physical signs of deterioration
he looked as well as ever his pitch-
ing seemed to be as good as it had ever
been but weak batters still found it

easy to hit and as for the sluggers
they simply murdered whatever larry
served to them

  dan fetherston had to speak at last
of course megrue wasnt an asset to
the turks any more he was the
heaviest sort of liability and every
one knew the reason

  well said dan one evening after
a particularly disastrous game what
seems to be the trouble larry

  i dunno said megrue helplessly
honest dan-ffm pitching as well as
i ever did theyve just got on to me
-vail

  regan says your curve isnt break-
ing and theres no hop to your fast one
larry

  regan was larrys regular catcher
and regan had said these things to
larry himself pointedly more than once
in the course of consultations on the
diamond

  they seem to know whats com-
ing fetherston went on at least-
they step out and hit as if they did
but as far as i can see your motions
as good as ever

  sure it is-and som i said larry
eagerly clutching at that straw say
-did you see what that big stiff tanzer
said about me in the star he as good
as put in his paper that it was be-
cause i was drinkin theyd started
hittin

  did he said fetherston well

  well you dont think so do you
dan gee-id quit-but i cant now
but shucks-thats not the reason

  it was the cry of a frightened puz-
zled boy that came from larry megrue
then and it was all fetherston could
do to refrain from breaking out from
talking as lloyd had put it like a dutch
uncle but others had tried that and
it had done no good he was deter-
mined now to stick to his own plan
it seemed to him that it was beginning
to work

  you ought to know was all he said


the popular magazine

i guess itd take a doctor to tell you
that larry im a baseball man not
a medico and-well you see how it
is larry yourself youre not doing
the team any good as it is

  megrue stared at him dead white of
a sudden but boy though he was and
foolish in the grip of something he had
not the will to fight much less con-
trol he couldnt resent the implication
in his managers words

  you-you mean youre going to let
me out he asked

  i dont see what else larry said
fetherston his voice was as kindly
as ever figure it out for yourself
the team isnt good enough to save you
when they start hitting like that what
else can i do

  nothin i guess said megrue after
a minute he gulped this was awful
it was worse than his dismissal from
the other teams far worse then he
had the feeling that he was being abused
to buoy him up he had been traded
or sold not for failure on the ball
field for he had never failed before
but for breaches of a discipline he had
always resented but now he didnt
have that to fall back on the ele-
mentary sense of justice that was in
him forced him to see that fetherston
was right that he had had every
chance and had failed himself and
for the first time a doubt of his own
wisdom came to him could it be that
after all the drinking did affect his
pitching he threw off the doubt but
it had found lodgment and it would
come back

  ill do the best i can for you larry
fetherston was saying ill try to land
you with a good minor-league team
and if you work hard you ought to be
able to come back better than ever

 comeback unhappy phrase for
it brought into larrys mind the harsh
proverb that has been proved true so
often and so bitterly they never

come back it cant be done still
he braced up he had to be game

  sure ill come back he said with
a touch of his old defiance ill show
you dan you-youve treated me
white

  fetherston turned away he was a
little nervous about meeting megrues
eyes just then for he knew what he
knew but after all it seemed to him
that his idea was beginning to work
out this certainly was not the same
megrue who had joined the turks he
had been chastened he wasnt quite
so sure of himself this was good
for dan fetherston be it understood
had no idea of seeing larry megrue
forced out of organized baseball by his
thirst

  to megrue however it seemed that
he had fallen through the very bottom
of things when he had his next in-
terview with his manager for fether-
ston with a glum face told him he was
going to the mayfield team

  mayfield said larry wheres
that dan  i never heard of any may-
field team in a double a league

  its not in one of those leagues
larry they passed you up you see
-well theyve heard things about you
i guess they dont want to take a
chance

  he let that sink in he let larry
megrue understand that the two big
minor leagues had actually refused to
make a place for him and when me-
grue had fully realized that astound-
ing thing when he comprehended that
his pride had been stabbed to the quick
with a dagger of contempt then dan
fetherston skillfully removed the dag-
ger and finished the work with a har-
poon

  i couldnt place you where i wanted
at all larry he said regretfully
this mayfield team-well its in a
class d league and its a little town
way out west youre going to they
were the only people seemed to want
it can be done



you the manager theres an old pal
of mine-used to catch on the same
team with me when i was breaking in
he-well he sort of thinks hes doing
me a favor larry

  class d do you know what that
means there are the major leagues
then come the aa circuits the big
minor leagues that are just below them
then the class a circuits which are
pretty good leagues made up of towns
of a hundred thousand or so popula-
tion by the time you have gone
through b and c you can imagine what
is left for class d county seats little
towns that have asterisks after them

on the through time-tables- stops

on signal only

  i wont go there said larry turn-
ing a stricken face to fetherston

  suit yourself of course the
manager shrugged his shoulders but
just what else do you figure you can
do boy got a profession waiting for
you to step in been studying law on
the side or something like that this
is a job you know theres grub and
cigarette money in it anyhow
megrue went of course there
wasnt anything else for him to do
he reached mayfield in a mood that
forbade approval he hadnt been able
to get a drink on the train he had for-
gotten to supply himself at st louis
and the evenness of mayfield seen
after dark for the first time frightened
him there were no bright lights
there were few people in the streets
moreover he didnt like his new man-
ager jud morton

  morton had been in mayfield for
two years he was through as a big-
league catcher and he was in mayfield
getting managerial experience he
kept in touch wfth the big-league teams
by scouting and he had already sent
up three promising recruits in due
time he would begin his climb upward
to a real managers job he knew all

about megrue too and his manner
showed it

  come along he said ive got a
room for you in the lincoln house-
thats where we live mostly its not a
big-league hotel but i guess you can
stand it the foods fair

  larry trudged along in silence his
gloom was too deep for words to ex-
press

  ill hand you some good advice
son said morton dans written me
about you an he says he likes you i
like him so im standing for you the
thing you want to do first oft is to for-
get all about the time when you were
burning up the big league thats all
over and done with-see youre
playing ball for me now and all youve
got to do is to work your hardest to
cinch a pennant for mayfield you
cant get by for a minute on what you
used to be in this league most of the
boys are thinking about to-morrow in-
stead of yesterday you want to paste
that in your hat

  larry looked about him furtively for
a saloon he wondered when morton
would begin to talk about his drinking
but morton was through-and larry
for some reason couldnt see anything
that looked like a barroom he felt
that he oughtnt to ask morton for
directions then he brightened there
would be a bar in the hotel and if
not the clerk could advise him dis-
astrous as his recent experiences had
been he had even now  inkling of
the last and worst blow that awaited
him

  a quick look around in the hotel
lobby failed to reveal any bar but he
liked the looks of the clerk he would
probably be friendly he registered
and got a key then morton looked
at his watch

  gee ten-thirty he said guess
ill be turning in better hit the hay
yourself megrue i may use you to-
morrow


the popular magazine

  larry yawned artistically all
right he said but the idea that he
might have to pitch didnt alter his
fixed determination suppose he did
have to go in what could these bush-
ers do against him he could beat
them with his left arm so he went
upstairs with morton who volunteered
to show him his room he took off
his coat and said good night and then
when morton had gone he put it on
again slipped downstairs and leaned
confidentially over the desk to address
the clerk

  say pal he inquired where can
i go to get one fine big drink-and
maybe two or six more to chase it
down 

  the clerk stared at him then he
whistled

  what are you handing me  he said
dont you know this states dry  and
it didnt have its fingers crossed when
it voted prohibition either you cant
get a drink here my friend they
closed up a blind tiger about three
months ago-and the chap who was
running it is still in jail i guess that
sort of discouraged any one who wanted
to start another its fine and jail for
having any hard stuff in your posses-
sion 

  megrue had to believe him the
clerks manner was convincing he
turned and went upstairs with bowed
shoulders on top of all the rest this
was too much he had heard of pro-
hibition states of course but he had
never realized that you couldnt get a
drink in one his spirit was broken
he was about ready to quit

  he didnt make an auspicious start
with his new team he had done some
pretty hard drinking after fetherston
had told him he was going to the minors
he had kept it up as far as st louis
on the train and the one night he had
spent in the missouri metropolis had
been an eventful one the sudden
deprivation of alcohol upset his system

now his nerves began to go back on
him and the earnest young bushers
who opposed him hit him pretty hard
his real pitching skill of course car-
ried him through but he wasnt the
old larry megrue and he knew it now
as well as any one

  entirely aside from his condition and
his bad pitching however he wasnt
happy he missed the easy good-fel-
lowship he had been used to with the
big-league teams morton evidently
rather despised him he understood that
the old catcher really did feel that he
was doing a kindly thing in sheltering
fetherstons discard and the rest of
the team fought rather shy of him he
wasnt their sort between awe of his
past triumphs and a disposition to fol-
low mortons lead they left him pretty
much to himself

  he was young yet and his body
stopped craving stimulation after a few
days he didnt need alcohol half as
much as he thought he did of course
his nerves adjusted themselves and he
began to feel better naturally his
pitching improved before he had been
in mayfield three weeks he was toying
with every team in that patchwork
league he had the class and now
that he was giving himself a fair
chance-though he wasnt doing that of
his own volition-he pitched as well as
ever so he used up some of his first
pay in sending a long telegram to dan
fetherston begging for another chance
fetherston didnt wire back he wrote

  its not up to me the big boss says he
doesnt believe youd keep it up he thinks
youre a boozer and that youd start drink-
ing again if you came back morton says
the reason youre making good out there is
that you cant get a drink im not saying a
word about that you remember i always
told you that was up to you but you see
how it is i cant bring you back because the
big boss thinks youd start drinking again
and that youd fall down hard as soon as
you did

  he wanted to cry like a baby when
it can be done



he got that letter his body had
stopped shrieking for alcohol but he
still wanted it he wanted a drink
he wanted the taste of it rather than
the result but he didnt know enough
about himself and things in general to
know what a vast difference there is
between the two sorts of desire he
was tempted to write back to fether-
ston and promise never to drink again
but then his streak of native obstinacy
stopped him

  im going to find out he said to
himself i bet theres some way i can
get the stuff then ill know im not
going to quit just because some one
tells me to

  but it really wasnt easy for him to
put his plan through that state be-
lieved in prohibition it had a good
law and it enforced it strictly it took
larry some time to get into the con-
fidence of a certain druggist but he
did it at last he got a demijohn of
the sort of whisky the third rail in the
subway was named for and he used
it freely-with the inevitable result
he had meant to stay in his room in
the hotel but his exhilaration de-
manded space he emerged and ap-
peared in the main street he was ar-
rested five minutes later-and didnt
care but the next morning in the
town lockup with eyes that smarted
and a throbbing aching head he had
changed his mind about a number of
things he was meekness itself when
morton came to see him morton with
a glum face

  fine business said the manager
he shook his head gloomily you
poor fool-dont you know this aint
nyawk or chicago

  i been an awful fool said larry
say get me out of here an ill be
careful after this-

  get you out said morton what
do you think i am-the governor of
the state  i cant get you out i cant
even give bail-they wont take it

  larry swallowed this astounding
statement whole it has been sug-
gested before that his wisdom was al-
most entirely confined to the art of
pitching

  aw say he said badly scared
this aint no states prison offense
they cant do moren fine me for get-
ting tight morton just looked at
him can they  he asked weakening
a little

  no said morton judicially not
for that they cant but they searched
your room and found that demijohn
with a lot of stuff in it why didnt you
pour it out the window now theyve
got you for having whisky in your pos-
session without a license

  larry remembered dimly what the
hotel clerk had told him his head
ached too badly for him to reason very
much he looked at morton with eyes
that were bright with terror

  ill do what i can for you boy
said morton more kindly but youre
in bad let me tell you mighty bad
youll be indicted sure and i wouldnt
wonder if you got a year in the pen
anyhow still they may be a bit easier
on you ill use what pull ive got

  you may guess that larry megrue in
his lonely cell had food for thought
it was served with repentance sauce
too this put drinking in an entirely
new light he hadnt enjoyed himself
the night before either he was a
mighty unhappy young man and he
couldnt blame a soul in the world but
himself for what had happened either

  morton came to see him once in a
while but he wasnt a messenger of
good cheer the grand jury hadnt met
yet but when it did an indictment was
certain and until his trial came up
there was nothing to be done that was
the burden of mortons song and
then one day he had another visitor
he thought he was seeing things when
dan fetherston appeared but dan
was real and he was cheerful too


the cpqcpular magazine

  too bad larry he said thought
id come and see what i could do
dont like to leave a pal when he gets
in bad tell me about it

  which larry did-at great length
they had me right dan he said
in the end lloyd and the rest of
em i was plumb crazy its the
booze has done this to me and if i
ever get out of this ill never touch
another drop-believe me

  so said dan thoughtfully you
sound as if you meant that larry
you bet i mean it said megrue
aw say-i been a fool long enough
aint i

  dan regarded him for several mo-
ments then he spoke-with a rash
impulsiveness that was very convinc-
ing in view of-the fact that this mo-
ment was the culmination of the plan
he had made when he bought larry
from the brewers

  ill take a chance on you he said
maybe the big bossll fire me for it
-but he wont if you back my play
and make good listen-ive got a
little private pull here the judge in
this town went to school with my
father hell take bail for you if i
promise youll be here to stand trial
i-i sort of hate to throw him down
but ill do it for you then you jump
on the first eastbound train with me
and come back to the turks if you
make good and stick to that about not

going back to drinking-

  he was opening the gates of paradise
to larry

  will i said megrue huskily aw

  they put that nefarious program
through when dan fetherston put up
one hundred dollars in cash bail judge
barry smiledat him

  its about time he said i dont
know how much longer my conscience
would have let me keep that poor kid
in jail even if it was for his own good
and i was doing a favor to jud mor-
ton here i guess this bail wont be
forfeited if he doesnt turn up either
give it to charity then said feth- 
erston we can do more than that
for mayfield if this little farce comedys
made a real pitcher of larry megrue
again

  its done that or i miss my guess
said morton but what i want to
know is how he went back so suddenly
before you shipped him out here dan 
easiest thing in the world said
fetherston only-dont let any one
know i told you every team in the
league was in on that little conspiracy

i had regan-he was catching him-
tip every batter off to just what was
coming of course they could hit him
then youknow what his control is-
he never crossed the signs

  morton whistled in admiring won-
der

  going to tell him about it

  i guess so-on the train said
fetherston thoughtfully he needs
something to give him back his con-
fidence and i guess hes just about
humble enough to listen to me too

  it appeared that fetherston was
right for in what was left of that
season larry megrue pitched fourteen
games-of which he won eleven

what happened to a packet of gold certificates value  the events
of thirty hours they made history for los animose in new mexico and

new mexico those who could truly
boast of these accomplishments and a
passable face and figure required few
further testimonials for home was
usually a long ways off and aspiring
employers could not afford to be ca-
pricious where demand so far exceeded
supply even the most opulent those
who were able and willing to pay a
fat salary for a secretary who could
take reasonably fast dictation and tran-
scribe it accurately in decently punctu-
ated english were obliged to be thank-
ful for indifferent service or write their
own letters

  no wonder therefore that the presi-
dent of the citizens bank in los ani-
mose was usually voted the luckiest
kind of a lucky devil for engaging the
services of miss claudia hyde though
he was known to pay well for them
claudia could have qualified for a first-
class secretary in any community being
just about the right age of good height
and slim lithe figure fair and peachy
she combined with her other accom-
plishments a stock of sweet smiles and
good words that made her practically
irresistible

  not only the men but most of the
women fell quickly under claudias
charm even her landlady doted on
her the ministers wife dubbed her

first lieutenant in all matters social
and charitable the village wits spared
her absolutely in the pursuit of their
avocations

  thus we find claudia at the begin-
ning of this narrative very comfortably
seated in a deep-cushioned revolving
chair on the outer edge of the presi-
dents office near the always open door
she was not too far away from the reg-
ular banking activities to exchange
words now and then with mr donnelly
the cashicr and when his back was
turned with young jimmy marcy
bookkeeper messenger and general
assistant

  in this community largely composed
of rough men who neither respected nor
acknowledged the conventionalities
claudia was compelled to see and hear
while affecting mute unconsciousness
to be sure after the word had gone
forth that she was strictly on the
level men who at other times were
never known to lower their voices or
temper their profanities became in her
presence more chary of their words and
less lurid in their descriptions at that
she heard much more than she liked

  mr donnelly the cashier-a high
roller-who already had a wife some-
where pestered her constantly to elope
with him and young marcy begged her
between times to go into partnership
with him for the long journey she
turned both of them down regularly and
often but apparently without any


the vovulatr magazine

grudge for she kept right on being
friends with them just the same there
were others too-but she kept her own
counsel

  way down in the bottom of her
maiden heart were protest ennui and
loathing for los animose and most of
new mexico male female and neuter
nobody guessed her feelings nobody
sensed remotely that she rejected new
mexico and pined for the bright lights
of the metropolis which she was se-
cretly planning to regain

  when her chance came suddenly un-
premeditated she rose instantly to the
occasion and played the game how
she fared furnishes the meat of this
narrative the time consumed to the
end of this chapter was less than thirty
hours but these made history for clau-
dia and annals for los animose

  the president of the citizens bank
started it he dictated a brief note to
the grand central bank of new york
city that he was sending twenty thou-
sand dollars in currency by express to
keep up their balance

  claudia typed the letter and brought
it to him for signature

  donnelly he called to the cashier
before you go away to-day on your
vacation attend to shipping this money
send twenty thousand dollars in gold
certificates claudia you make out an
express money package now for mr
donnelly

  claudia had a supply of express-
money packages for such occasions-
large heavy manilla envelopes printed
and furnished by the express company
she typed one with the address of both
parties contents et cetera paused a
few seconds in thought-not longer-
and typed another envelope exactly like
the first into this one she thrust a
number of second sheets which she first
cut to the size of bank notes with her
sharp eraser moistened the flap with
her red lip and sealed it down tight

  she did all this very quickly but

absolutely without hurry no one ob-
serving could have suspected that she
was doing anything unusual or that she
was either nervous or excited on the
contrary a complacent smile hovered 
her face during the operation as if her
thoughts were altogether entertaining
and agreeable

  it was the empty package that she
handed to mr donnelly from his
cage she sauntered leisurely over to
where young marcy was at work on
his high stool she pressed so close to
jimmy that the tendrils from her golden
hair brushed his face and intoxicated
his senses

  listen quick jimmy she whis-
pered if you still want to marry me
and arent just bluffing here is your
chance will you do what i tell you

  jimmy stuttered

  does that stutter mean yes asked
claudia

  jimmy nodded vigorously he was
a slow speaker and not a quick thinker

  then listen the old man  said
claudia whispering very softly but
enunciating very carefully so that
jimmy could not miss a syllable told
donnelly to send twenty thousand dol-
lars to new york by express before
he leaves to-day on his vacation don-
nelly will send you to the express office
with the package here is one like it
get your old seal on it and when don-
nelly gives you the real one put it in
your pocket and ship this one instead
be quick dont lose a moment hell
send for you right away do you get
me

  jimmy nodded and took the package
mechanically

  claudia wandered carelessly and
gracefully back toward her chair as
she passed donnellys cage on her way
back he called to her rather huskily
she thought to please tell jimmy to
come to him for the package for the
express

  now it is a fact of which claudia
cpucpcpets on a storing



had some suspicion that donnelly as
she turned toward jimmy and went to
deliver the message took the twenty
certificates out of the package he was
apparently in the act of closing and
filled it up again with pieces of blank
paper he had been preparing for the
purpose he pasted the flap down and
sealed the package in jimmys presence
with three large piles of red sealing wax
indented with the new seal jimmy was
a little slow because he had to seal the
dummy first with the old bank seal
but he got to the cashiers cage almost
as soon as the cashier was ready for
him

  donnelly should have noticed that
jimmy was paler than usual and very
jerky he gave him the package and
told him to take it over to the express
office and hurry back because he had
a lot of matters to explain to him be-
fore he the cashier went away on his
vacation with less on his mind he
could not have failed to note jimmys
very obvious trepidation

  claudia saw it she called jimmy
over to her desk as he was leaving the
cashier

   dont lose your nerve jimmy she
whispered remember faint heart
doesnt get you anywhere bring the
package over to my room after clos-
ing

  jimmy made the exchange on his way
to the express office he pushed the
dummy through the window to the ex-
press agent who sewed it thrice through
and sealed it over with the knots with
great heaps of blazing green sealing
wax and the express companys big seal
-all in jimmys presence before he
wrote the receipt which the agitated
jimmy walking away left on the ex-
press counter

   a big hulking man with long droop-
ing mustache white felt hat and eyes
i of the sort to penetrate the armor of a
superdreadnaught picked up the receipt
on the counter and read it through

carefully before he ran after jimmy to
give it to him he caught him on the
steps of the bank gave him the receipt
and watched him thoughtfully as he
disappeared within after which he
pulled his hat down firmly on his head
went quickly back to the square
mounted his horse and galloped out of
town in a cloud of dust

  if jimmy could have followed this in-
dividual he would have traveled more
than thirty miles that afternoon to a
ranch at the foot of the mountains
where bill loosed his horse in the
corral and hurried to the house carry-
ing his saddle with him

  butch said he to another mus-
tached desperado like himself who was
eating his dinner weve got to hold
up the south local before morning at
the lopez tank and get twenty thousand
dollars in bills the bank sends east to-
night

  but of course jimmy couldnt follow
him and never thought of it he went
back to his work nodding to claudia
that all was well and thrilling all over
his big frame from the kiss claudia
blew him in reward he had to stick
around the bank however till late to
get all of donnellys instructions for
donnelly was to leave for his vacation
on an early train the next morning it
was quite nine oclock before they sepa-
rated in front of the hotel donnelly to
retire to his room upstairs on the sec-
ond floor jimmy to seek the waiting
expectant claudia

  she met him at the door finger to
her lips led him to a chair kissed him
lightly as a zephyr on his manly brow
but eluded his attempt to embrace her

  youre a nice boy she said but
not yet and theres no time ive
got to pack give me the package and
run along and get your things together
weve got to get out of here in the
morning

  oh i cant go away like that clau-
dia said jimmy whats the hurry


the vovulacr magazine

nobody can find out anything for a
whole week but here is the package
anyway he added taking it out of his
pocket and handing it to her she
seized it with no apologies with a hat-
pin she unceremoniously ripped it open
and with her right hand extracted the
contents to wit a handful of yellow
papers

  apparently astounded and shocked
she stood perfectly motionless for a
brief interval as if fascinated jimmy
his mouth open his jaw dropped was
incapable of any utterance

  why you fool you silly fool she
breathed at last through clenched teeth
you sent the wrong package this is
the dummy

  during the next few minutes clau-
dia gentle but explicit told jimmy the
history of his father mother and all his
grandparents on both sides back to
adam as explanatory and as confirm-
ing jimmys imbecility and general
worthlessness finishing in a burst of
rage and hysterics striking him with
her hands and forcing him out of the
house without however making any
great noise or disturbance

  jimmy left protesting and trembling
like the doddering idiot she pro-
claimed him after he had gone she
collapsed in a chair in a fit of hysterical
laughter until the mood passed when
she literally sat up and got busy

  with great care she examined the
package and its contents noting the
color of the sealing wax the character
of the seal and particularly the slips of
yellow paper her trained acute in-
telligence brought light on the situation

  just as i feared she muttered with
a wan smile but im glad for one
thing i might have had trouble losing
jimmy

  up in his chamber in the hotel be-
hind locked door and drawn blinds
donnelly took the bills out of his pocket
and looked at them admiringly he
counted them-twenty one-thousand-

dollar gold certificates and he would
get away with them too he thought
egotistically before any one had the
least suspicion of course nobody must
see them or know he had so much
money until he was safe over in mexico
he took a long strong white envelope
from a bunch on his desk scattering the
others placed the bills in it sealed it
and put it under his pillow with his gun
on top of it he packed what clothes
he needed for immediate use in his hand
bag the rest in his trunk which he in-
tended to leave behind as a sort of ear-
nest of his return but he intended
never to return to the new mexican
country again if he could help it

  when he had completed his packing
he turned out the light and got into bed
falling immediately into a heavy slum-
ber tired by the days strain the ex-
citement he was undergoing brought
dreams which kept him tossing till after
dawn but he never waked from his
slumbers till the bell boy called him and
told him to hurry or he would miss his
train

  while he was sleeping several things
happened bearing upon his affairs

  dramatically disguised bill and
butch tied their horses out of sight up
the lopez road and hid themselves
near the water tank

  when the train stopped at the tank
and filled up the boiler of the locomo-
tive bill climbed into the cab and got
the drop on the engineer butch slipped
in the back door of the combination
baggage and express car and caught the
messenger napping the south local be
it understood was a poor excuse of a
train that ran to the junction sixty-odd
miles away the locomotive was a dis-
card from the main line the coaches
also the baggage car lacked a door lock
and the messenger was a pensioner who
earned double his pension it did not
take bill and butch long to do the trick
butch tied up the messenger and bill
kicked the engineer off the train a
cpucpcpets on jj string



little farther along bill and butch
jumped and left the locomotive and car
to move under their own momentum on
a slight down grade

  they quickly located their horses up
the lopez road and dashed away at
top speed by making a detour they
entered los animose from the north
side nobody saw them but claudia
and she didnt tell bill was a regular
boarder at the hotel when they
reached his room dead tired almost
exhausted they finished a quart bottle
of robinson county pulled off their
boots and should have tumbled into
bed but curiosity prevailed and they
first opened the package

  on learning the trick fate had played
them they first stared stupidly at the
blank yellow contents too stumped for
ordinary articulation but thoroughly
alive to the temptation to break loose
with yells of rage and disappointment
and too wise to do it the hold on their
tongues gradually relaxed however
and released a steady stream of hushed
hyperbole which had better be imagined
than described when they had said
everything they could think of and re-
peated some of it several times without
in the least having exhausted the topic
they put their weary heads on the pil-
lows and slept breathing great threats
of horrible vengeance against the
cashier and jimmy

  meanwhile claudia had been up and
doing

  just before the first gray of dawn
sought out the sand spots between the
sagebushes while bill and butch were
spurring their tired horses in the last
drive for los animose claudia dressed
in black and heavily veiled slipped out
of her boarding house and up the street
into the hotel in one pocket was a
skeleton key in the other an automatic
and she carried an electric torch to light
the way she knew the number of
donnellys room-that it was on the
second floor-and doubted not that she

could find it she crept silently across
the hotel office and up the stairs not
a board creaked she found donnellys
room opened it with her skeleton key
-got who knows in what adventure-
entered cautiously and turned her spot-
light on the trunk in the corner on the
bag near the door on the envelopes
scattered over the desk and on don-
nelly snoring with his mouth open and
head twisted from under the pillow
protruded the corner of the envelope
and the handle of his gun

  very gently almost soothingly clau-
dia withdrew the envelope and brought
it over to the desk where she noiselessly
opened it her face took on an almost
holy expression as she counted the
twenty thousand dollars and hid the
package in her dress the corners of
her mouth twitched humorously and
she suppressed a desire to giggle as
with deft fingers she filled one of the
envelopes on the desk with the yellow
papers she had with her sealed it up
tight and shoved it far under don-
nellys pillow

  he has cast his bread upon the wa-
ters quoted claudia half aloud and
a clever man keeps his money in the
bank for fear of fires or robbers

  leaving as silently as she came she
tiptoed downstairs across the office to
the veranda gray-pink lights from the
eastern range heralded the coming day
she heard sounds of approaching foot-
steps and hid herself behind the big
porch chairs just in time to miss being
seen by bill and butch returning from
their holdup and dragging their weary
bones to bed

 my what rough men thought
claudia

  nobody saw claudia as she slipped
up the street and returned to her board-
ing house she did not bother to wait
around for leave-takings but wrote a
few notes breaking the sad news of her
departure and promising soon to return
then she got a man to take her trunk


the popular magazine

to the station ate a good hearty break-
fast at a greaser lunch counter and
reached the depot telegraph office ahead
of donnelly whose train for the south
was due to leave before hers for the
north here she sent a long telegram
to an address in san francisco-a tele-
gram which greatly peeved the oper-
ator because he could not make any
sense out of it

  oversleeping donnelly had to run
for his train carrying his heavy bag in
one hand and his precious envelope
tightly grasped in the other he passed
a radiant claudia who smiled on him
so sweetly and gave him her hand so
gayly that he regretted as he stood on
the back platform of the moving train
not having asked her again and given
her another chance

  but claudia was headed for bright
lights city pavements and turkish
baths los animose and new mexico
should know her no more

  her one regret she assured herself
as she sat in the train and watched the
plains flash by was that she couldnt
see donnellys face when he next
counted his money but she cried a
little very privately for some reason
known only to herself

  and back in los animose at the
bank a disconsolate forlorn jimmy and
an incomplete profane president were
both wondering if claudia had eloped
with the cashier after all

ii

  the great detective heard about
the holdup of the south local for twenty
thousand dollars at lopez tanks when
lie reached el paso on his way home
from mexico about four in the after-
noon meanwhile the news had trav-
eled all the evening papers from san
francisco to chicago carrying big lead-
ers and making the most of it being
so near the spot he concluded it was
best for him to go on to los animose
instead of sending one of his men

  of course he had to change to the
local at the junction where he appeared
unexpectedly in the express car and put
the messenger through a cross-examina-
tion that left him mentally only a heap
of dry bones from the messenger and
engineer he secured a complex descrip-
tion of the bandits-two men about six
feet tall rough and vicious disguised
by red bandanna handkerchiefs put
over their faces with holes cut through
for eyes and mouths a gang most
certainly though two were all they saw
such a description was enough to put
any aspiring detective on his mettle a
mans job he thought and decided to
take it in his own hands

  after consulting over the wires with
the big man in san francisco he issued
posters offering a reward of one thou-
sand dollars each for evidence that
would arrest and convict these two men
and an additional reward of two thou-
sand dollars for the return of the
money

  bill and butch were good sleepers
they stayed abed all day and did not
appear at the hotel office until evening
they awoke with a grim consciousness
of their failure-not just a plain failure
such as one must expect to meet with
occasionally in the ordinary course of
highwaying and train robbing but a
clean do in other words they knew
they had been made monkeys of by one

or other or both of those -tender-

feet at the bank

  after supper bill strolled out into
the town to get a line on the cashier
but returned soon in a frightful rage
with the information that donnelly had
purchased a ticket for benson and left
town early in the morning and was well
on his way to join the dons

  the arrival of the great detective
served timely notice on bill and butch
that the worst was to come the g d
had a big reputation in new mexico
and bill and butch would have run for
puppets on a storing



it like a pair of scared hares only they
hadnt the stuff to run with when the
posters came out offering rewards for
their apprehension they did some tall
thinking

  said bill after an hours steady
chewing weve got to skip or squeak
if the g d lands  us its up the
road well go for nobodyll believe we
are just plain goats with nothing but
our goatees to show for it

  watll we do asked butch
  squeak i reckon said bill
  wats the use said butch

  dont you see you blithering idiot
said bill soothingly the g d will
scorch our trail cause the express has
got to pay up the twenty big bucks
thats what sets on the g d

  butch whistled

  yes said bill now if he just
knew what we knows thatd let the ex-
press out all right and put it back on
the bank good and straight maybe
hed give us a reward

  or send us up said butch

  course the other side the bank
might pay us to keep quiet

  butch nodded

  theres no joker in the pack con-
tinued bill but whats the trump
thats what gets me goin

  play em both said butch

  nope said bill on further
thoughts ill trust the thief taker
theres honor butch between thieves
but nix in high finance

  youve got a great head for mixin
bill gos far as you like

  bill lounged down the stairs across
the office through the bar and onto the
veranda not finding the g d he
sauntered with affected nonchalance on
up the street toward the express office
on the way he met the g d the g
d knew bill they had met before in
business and neither had very much on
the other now they sensed a common
thought and though they merely
nodded in passing they turned around

almost simultaneously and faced each
other

  spit it out bill said the g d

  its on the level said bill and
very private

  say where then said the g d
lets take a walk said bill
around the farm

  an hour later the g d and bill
parted on the outskirts of the town

  go back said the fonner stick
to the hotel till you hear from me dont
talk no not even to butch tell him
to hold his jaw remember im just
doing this for you bill when you dont
deserve it and ought to go to jail play
me straight and follow orders or ill
jail you off the bat

  all right cap said bill but re-
member we want some of the reward
when its passed out

  drop that bill therell be no re-
ward for either of you for robbing
trains and growing goatees but leave
it to me maybe i can point out to you
later where you and butch can earn
some money by working for it now
march you bushwhacker march

  in a quiet corner of the express of-
fice out of sight of everybody the g
d held a conference with a bunch of
long black moist stogies that had a
kick in each puff when he finished the
last of them he broke up the meeting
and though it was late and he had
missed his dinner walked briskly up the
street to the bank

  the bank was closed for the day but
as there was a light burning in the presi-
dents office he hammered at the door
until the old man came and let him
in the president was called the old
man not because he was really old
but because of his old ways and gal-
lant bearing

  the g d introduced himself and
followed the president back into his
office the latter was not in his best
humor but punctiliously courteous he


the cpqcpulatr magazine

was worrying about claudia he missed
her because he had had to write a long
letter to the grand central bank tell-
ing them what had happened and to as-
sure them that the express company
would probably settle the matter with
no delay to do him justice that was
the least of his reasons for missing
claudia in a way he felt sorry for the
express company-that sort of compla-
cent gratified sorry one feels for an
enemy hoisted on his own petard he
felt no anxiety about the money took
it for granted the express would pay
never apprehended the least complica-
tion he accepted the g ds call as
a preliminary apology to the bank for
the remissness of the carrier so he
gave the g d a henry clay perfecto
and a match and saw him seat himself
in claudias sacred chair-the only
deep-cushioned one in the office-with
somewhat mixed sensations

  the g d filled his lungs with the
fragrant smoke leaned back and put
his feet on the desk fine evening
said he

  beautiful answered the president
his mind wandering

  sad sort of thing that holdup at
lopez said the g d

  very said the president and then
politely any clews 

  well maybe drawled the g d
according to the way you look at
them may i ask you a few questions
in the way of increasing my informa-
tion 

  fire away said the president
consider me entirely at your service
who made up the package

  mr donnelly our cashier

  where is he

  on his vacation oh you mean what
place i think he went to benson
yes i remember that is where he was
going he left the night or morning
of the train robbery

  is this the package asked the g
d suddenly taking out of his pocket

the packet butch had stolen and hand-
ing it to the president

  his smile stiffening a little the presi-
dent looked the package over carefully
examined the seal of the bank and that
of the express company-the former in
green wax and the latter in red wax

  yes he said finally i think this
is the one

  in that case said the g d rising
you have got your own again and all
ends happily i have only now to take
your receipt for the package and bid
you good evening glad to see you in
frisco when youre up our way

  of course this is a glad surprise
said the president but young man
permit me to remark that we shipped
this package to the address  the face
of it for delivery at that address and
expect your company to perform its
part in the transaction im glad you
have the robbers you really have
them eh i think-he paused with
his hand in the package and withdrew
it at the same time taking out the
blanks with their cords which the g d
had put through them to make the pack-
age look natural-why whats this
coloring with indignation-not a prac-
tical joke i hope

  not at all said the g d the
package you hold is the one our agent
receipted for on the security of your
bank seal after sewing it and sealing
it himself in the presence of your mes-
senger observe that your bank seals
and our express seals are intact the
package was stolen from the messen-
ger by train robbers and when opened
contained only this blank paper no
money in other words its a phony
package

  silence followed this speech the g
d wanted to let it sink in and the bank
president was thinking deeply

  what would you suggest doing he
asked no-raising his hand-dont
say its up to me perhaps it is this
is a sudden development and i cannot
cpucpcpets on a storing



yet arrange my ideas tell me unof-
ficially what you advise my doing about
it i dont want it to get around that
the bank is involved in a theft of twenty
thousand dollars-a heavy loss for our
little bank moreover donnelly being
away on his vacation and my private
secretary also and nobody here to do
the work except jimmy marcy and the
office boy leaves me at a disadvantage
im ready to help you any way i
may said the g d of course my
first duty is to my company but in a
case like this i think i can offer my
services who do you think took the
money

  after all said the president
thoughtfully who could it have been
except donnelly

  tell me the course of the transac-
tion

  i dictated a letter to the grand cen-
tral bank stating that we would send
them twenty thousand dollars in cur-
rency claudia wrote it and addressed
the money package which she gave to
donnelly who presumably took the
bills out of the safe put them in the
package and sealed it before jimmy
marcy jimmy took it to the express
office and brought back the receipt
that makes three people said the
g d claudia i suppose is your sec-
retary is she also on her vacation
not exactly she got angry about
something jimmy says and said she
was going to leave the country i dont
connect her in any way with it

  could she have eloped with the
cashier

  i could not possibly believe it

  we can trace her later if neces-
sary said the g d there is no
probability of her being a principal in
the robbery but about donnelly he
has had time to hear about the train
robbery has he telegraphed you or
written 

  not a word what do you make of
that

  b

  to sum up said the g d it looks
like the cashier is there anything about
the outside of the package or the
contents to give you any clews no
well then i think i had best take the
package into my keeping for the pres-
ent ill start our machinery looking
for donnelly immediately if you wish
me to do so i can send two men i have
here who know donnelly and have a
grudge against him to follow him over
into mexico and seize the money by
this time he is probably across the bor-
der and the best to be done is to secure
the money or what is left of it of
course we will have to locate him first
and then these men will have to receive
money for their expenses and get a
reward if they recover the money for
you

  start up your machine captain
said the president and ill call my di-
rectors together in the morning and
have them decide on further actions

iii

  the president had a great deal to
think of that night but the question
where is claudia constantly ob-
truded itself and there was no answer
possible

  in the morning he had a hot session
with his board of directors

  i always thought you were making a
mistake to trust donnelly growled the
biggest stockholder

  he was bonded said the president
in the pan-american surety com-
pany

  for how much snorted the big-
gest stockholder

ten thousand said the president

  ten thousand sneered the biggest
stockholder and youll have to prove
it on donnelly before you get even that
we are stung all right i reckon now
that i think of it he continued sav-
agely didnt you tell me some time ago
that the surety company wrote you that


the popular magazine

donnellys habits were such that they
felt compelled to warn us against him 
ive kept my eye on him said the
president

  kept your eye on him sneered the
biggest stockholder looks like it
there was a knock on the door and
the president answered it

  telegram for you sir said jimmy
boy just brought it

  the president returned to the table
with it in his hand unopened the big-
gest stockholder was still fuming

  i tell you mason he said to the
president you are entirely too lax
theres that blond woman you hired at
an outrageous salary wheres she now 
how do you know shes not mixed up in

it i always thought-

  cut that out retorted the president
fiercely then quietly wait a minute
ive just received a telegram permit
me-opening it-its from the surety
company and says

  if possible come here immediately there
are important developments in view of
which your presence is necessary refuse
all discussions

  that sounds promising said the
biggest stockholder better go to-day

  on the third day after this confer-
ence the president of the citizens
wearing a worried look and a large
white stetson that made him a marked
man sent in his card to the president
of the pan-american surety company
and was promptly ushered into that gen-
tlemans most private office

  this is sad business mr mason
said he have you any clews

 yes we think it was donnelly
now said mason

  what makes you think that 

  the great detective thinks so said
mason

  the great detective that means
the express company will refuse to pay
eh and put it up to us well you
should have taken more precautions

about donnelly mr mason you must
remember that we warned you about
his habits i am sure we ought to op-
pose any claim against us under our
bond in view of the wording of our
letter to you on this subject in any
event should we succeed in recovering
the money or any portion of it we
should expect you to reimburse us for
any great expense we are placed to
in the matter

  ill pay it out of my own pocket
said mr mason hastily any reason-
able amount my directors are much
incensed about my indulgence of don-
nelly and this outcome of it does me
personal injury

  well well well interview the cul-
prit first and then ill let you talk
the matters of reward and expenses
over with the party most interested
what have you caught don-
nelly exclaimed mason in great sur-
prise where is he how did you
happen to catch him

  i think he is under guard in the
next room we were fortunate mr
mason in being promptly informed of
his escape and were thus able to secure
him while on his way to giiaymas

  it was a dejected and very crestfallen
donnelly who was brought into the
office under guard of a powerful surety
officer

  do you identify this man asked
the surety president

  oh yes said mason he is our
cashier mr donnelly

  well donnelly said the surety
president do you admit your iden-
tity

  donnelly nodded

  wheres the money questioned the
surety man fiercely well get you
twenty years for this if theres a dollar
missing where is it i say

 your men took it from me when
they shanghaied me said donnelly

  have you got it officer asked the
surety man
vuqxpets on a storing



  we took a big envelope away from
him when we took him said the offi-
cer he said it was very valuable
and to lake good care of it so i did
not open it we sealed it up in his
presence here it is

  the surety man took the big white
envelope with your permission mr
mason we will open the package and
count the swag but look here now
donnelly he interjected threateningly
no jokes is the money here

  yes growled donnelly

  the surety man slit the envelope with
a knife and took out the contents

  whats this whats this spread-
ing out the yellow blanks practical
joke eh mr donnelly-shaking his
forefinger in his face-i thought you
had more intelligence than to attempt
any such humor with me with me
mr donnelly who are  your bond
for ten thousand dollars and we can
make an example of you

  donnellys eyes almost popped out
of his head i swear he said ear-
nestly when he found his voice that
i put the money in that envelope he
gazed fascinated by the blank papers

  gentlemen he continued brokenly
after a moments thought and almost
whimpering theres magic at work
here i will make full confession i
put these yellow papers in the package
i sent to the express office and the bills
in my pocket-twenty one-thousand-
dollar gold certificates when i re-
turned to my room in the hotel i put
the bills in this envelope sealed it with
the mucilage and it has not been out
of my possession until your men shang-
haied me thats the whole truth so
help me

  and you have the audacity-the im-
pudence-to expect us to believe that
story thundered the surety man

  officer take him away no words
then to donnelly with a wave of his
hand if the full amount of the
money you stole is not repaid before

to-morrow morning or you do not in-
stantly tell us where you have hidden
it up the road you go for twenty years
remove him officer and keep him close
till i send over a warrant

  and now mr mason thats fin-
ished said the surety president and
i suppose you are disappointed and
wondering what to do next so am i
but just now i have to run away to
keep an appointment what do you
think about it

  im all up in the air said mason
the great detective came to me with
the original express package with a con-
tents similar to these yellow blanks and
said his company would not pay the
loss because donnelly had delivered
them a phony package everybody
seems to know more about it than i
do

  well ive got to go said the surety
man excuse me for a little while
make yourself at home

  mason left to himself soon found
his thoughts wandering from the main
points of the robbery he had wanted
to ask donnelly if he knew where
claudia was but could not bring him-
self to do so of course the money
loss was heavy but he was not a poor
man and could pay it himself if neces-
sary without any great hardship what
grieved him was that claudia had de-
serted he could not and would not
believe any wrong of her what was
more he wanted her

  to thunder with the money he
muttered claudia is more impor-
tant

  for a while he marched up and down
and back and forth intent upon his
own thoughts so that he did not at
first hear a light knock on the door
which had to be repeated several times
before he finally called come in

  to his complete surprise claudia en-
tered and after quietly closing the door
behind her held out her hand to him
and smiled brilliantly


the popular magazine

why claudia he exclaimed tak-
ing the proffered hand why clau-
dia claudia i am so glad to see you
where did you think i had gone
she asked archly

  mason looked pained

  did you think i had the twenty
thousand dollars mr mason and
did you think i had gone away with
donnelly she asked simply

  no indeed claudia on my life
no mason assured her earnestly i
did not and never will believe anything
but good of you

  oh im not good mr mason im
really quite a sinner and  did take
the money mr mason though i am
giving it back to you now said claudia
taking a small roll out of her reticule
and offering it to him count it mr
mason be sure its real money for
there have been a lot of blanks drawn
in these transactions

  mason grasped her hand with the
roll in it and held it tight

  hang the money said he its
not money i want claudia its you
even if im a thief asked claudia
i know youre a thief said mason
you stole my heart down in new
mexico and now i want you to take
the rest of me all i am all i have

  wait said claudia still smiling
but holding him off wait mr ma-
son you dont know me at all why
youve never seen me she took a
step backward raised her two hands
and with a quick motion stood revealed
a different claudia minus blond wig
with short dark curls clustering grace-
fully around her lovely brow

  now you see she said im some-
body different that you didnt know
what can that matter claudia it
is you i love not your disguise

 and you ask no questions not
even who i am or why or wherefore

man when he returned a little later and
looked around the office and when
he saw how matters stood

the queer place

by frederick niven

author of hands up  discretionary powers etc

the most stolid of men would turn with a shudder from the checkerboard in flannigans
hotel and yet it was the only amusement in sixty-two miles that checkerboard
and the queer race on the trail figure prominently in this eerie tale of the west

the celebrated speech of hamlet
to horatio beginning there
are more things in heaven and
earth came into the mind of
bill davies of ridge montana when
he got to the end of the sequence of
events that circled round the queer
place on the road to spring lake

  from ridge to midway is easy going
as a rule and at midway the freighters
camp there are not always freight-
ers there of course but since the
spring lake mines opened up to work
steadily day and night the chances are
in favor of seeing dotting the little
pocket valley at midway the twinkling
camp fires of the freighters outspanned
for the night there sometimes the only
light in the valley is the dropped yellow
star of buck flannigans hotel-the
only one between ridge and spring
lake

  buck built it when the placer miners
were tearing out the gravel at midway
thirty years ago he stayed on after
the creek bed had been torn out the
pocket desecrated and the banks on
either hand were left looking as if a
mad giant with a rake had been at
work there unshaven and bleary he
pottered about his paintless hotel while
year by year nature tried to cover over
the signs of havoc and the shacks of
what was once midway fell log by
log you could never say he had a jag

on he was just soaked yet always
coherent

  flannigans was thirty miles from
ridge and two and thirty from spring
lake and it looked very lonely and
flannigan was the split double of a
dime-novel cover of bad man plummer
-and there mark you were the holes
in the floor that told of dancing ten-
derfeet and there was flannigan smil-
ing as the chink put down your plate
of steak and onions and flannigans
voice huskily inquired what do you
drink with it

  most of the freighters did not go
near flannigans after they hauled into
the meadow just got the horses out
the nose bags on the frying pan on the
fire the blankets spread they might
in the morning have one at flanni-
gans but that was about the extent of
their visits for flannigans depressed
everybody it wasnt a hotel it was a
relict that checkerboard on the table
in the corner of the barroom was the
most tragic of checkerboards the
most stolid of men would turn with
a shudder from the checkerboard and
yet it was the only amusement in sixty-
two miles

  it used to haunt and fascinate bill
davies on the infrequent occasions that
loneliness or drizzle prompted him to
go over to flannigans after having
made camp perched on the high seat


the popular magazine

of his wagon waggling through the
mountains the impression ofthe lone
barroom with the lone checkerboard on
the corner table used to stay with him
even more poignantly than the impres-
sion of flannigan when flannigan
was talking to him-when flannigans
bulging washed-out eyes made him look
away as one looks away from a cuttle-
fish-bill used to look at that checker-
board  then back to flannigan he would
turn to find flannigans eyes queerer
still

  something queer about that checker-
board they didnt play checkers in the
old days when flannigans was open
day and night the cards slipped on
the table then the balls ran on the lit-
tle horses the dice rattled in those
days if you wanted to shake for a
drink with a friend at flannigans you
could by waggling your hand in air
for a sign as you advanced to the bar
have the dicebox clapped down there
for you it used to stand on a shelf
behind the bar a dicebox big as a large
pepper pot with dice half an inch
square but it was hidden away when
the gold seekers departed and nature
encroached again on midway-and
there was only the checkerboard

  queer

  so thought davies haunted by the
checkerboard as he waggled through the
soundless red-black woods on his high
wagon perch it was morning dewy
and fragrant in the mountains behind
him and below lay the meadow-mid-
way meadow-with its black marks of
old fires its torn river bed its molder-
ing shacks and flannigans the
horses hoofs fell muffled the wheels
rolled silently in the foot of dust that
was the road the only noise of his
progress was the squeak of cargo rub-
bing box against box and an occa-
sional clink of chains when the whiffle
swung

  queer about that checkerboard

  it suddenly struck him that there

was perhaps a game a man could play
by himself on a checkerboard

  oh maybe flannigan plays with
the chink he considered and smiled
to himself

  no flannigan sat all day playing a
solitary card game staring at the cards
setting them out rearranging them now
this way now that way while outside
the trees stood bolt upright round the
little bit of pocket of grass and the
shacks fell into decay and nothing hap-
pened but morning noon night and
the crawling hours between-nothing
sounded but the creek the crackle of
grasshoppers the occasional howl of
coyote or scream of bald-headed eagle

  davies dismissed the sense of queer-
ness and depression about the place
where he usually did dismiss it-dis-
missed flannigans codfish eyes the
furtive half-frightened-looking chink
and the memory of that barren interior
with the checkerboard on the corner
table he dismissed flannigans on ar-
rival at a spot where the horses always
shied or tried to bolt or tried to wheel
aside the same thing always happened
at this bend of the road and he sup-
posed that some former driver had
beaten the animals here-overbeaten
them too somehow or other it did
not strike him to wonder if both horses
had been beaten there if they had been
partners for years he didnt delve as
deep as that but he knew that about
two miles above flannigans going to-
ward spring lake he never failed to
have trouble with them

  to-day just after he passed that
place and got them sensible again he
saw ahead coming toward him two
riders they couldnt have come from
spring lake unless they had started
after supper last night it was still
early in the day and bill had been up
with the sunrise then he recognized
them one was captain moyes of the
moyes mines the other he believed
was a back-east engineer connected
the queecr place



with some syndicate-a man with a
double-barreled name he had heard
thompson-smith he thought it was
anyhow this man thompson-smith-
or johnson-smith he wasnt sure which
-was in the country looking at various
prospects that the success of the spring
lake vein was bringing before the gaze
of the speculators again so the boys
said at any rate davies gave them
how-do in passing and interested
in horseflesh as well as in the long lean
easterner who looked as if he should
have been a westerner he looked round
after them

  can ride all right he thought as
he observed a sudden trembling and
side dancing and general cavorting of
the young engineers horse at the bend
of the road it seemed to upset moyes
pony but bill knew that moyes was a
horseman and merely watched the
easterner he laughed as he saw that
long lean man dwindle down the road
staying with it excellently down the
aisle in the wood-for thus the slit of
wagon road seemed-a pennon of dust
wavered after the riders had vanished
round the bend

  a joggling of his wagon caused bill
to look ahead once more and caution
his horses with steady now  dont
you know the road by this time but
it was not fright with them again per-
haps in turning round to see how the
engineer fellow rode he had pulled a
rein by accident

  steady you steady 

  and they plodded on demureiy in the
steady and blameless plod into which
they always settled soon after having
passed that bend

ii

  about noon bill halted at saskatoon
creek hauling aside from the road as
was the usage with most who came
there whether others were expected or
not some would not haul aside until
they heard the squeak of harness or

joggle of load that announced another
team on trek but bill was not of those
he got out bits there and nose bags
on ran a careful eye and a massaging
hand over his big beasts rinsed his
hands in the creek and sat down to en-
joy his own lunch during the half-hour
rest

  he had just got through the rinsing
when from the direction of his travel
came the intermittent squeaks that an-
nounce an advancing wagon and here
it was waggling through the woods on
the deep-rutted road jim conyers
drowsy on high wrist on knee lines in
hand humming some plaintive and
catchy song they waved forefinger
and second finger of a hand to each
other grinned up grinned down and
then conyers reined in throwing a leg
negligently over the high seat to chat
at ease punctuating his remarks with
steady molly what you doin
sorrel oh stand still molly cant
you flick a fly off without turning the
rig over 

  that syndicate fellows still up in
the hills with moyes he said as a
piece of chatter reins over hooked el-
bow now enjoying his noon snack
they say moyes is liable to sell him
the nellie moyes prospect up on this
here spur more haulin then eh
and he looked up the precipitous hill
that sheered away with thet trees stand-
ing at acute angles to it

  thats where theyve been is it
answered bill i met them on the
road a bit back going toward flanni-
gans wondered what they had been
at to be so early on the road and so
far from spring lake

  did you moyes has an interest in
some other location on the other side
i suppose they were crossing to it if
they aint at flannigans when i get
there i guess thats where theyll be
-up on the other side they say that
long fellow-i forget his name-some-
thing-smith-represents enough dough


the popular magazine

to open up all the claims in the country
hes seen the ore to spring lake in
moyes office and now lies looking
where it comes from so i guess he has
intentions

  well hes some rider said bill
his horse went bughouse as sudden as
a knife just after we met and he gave
an exhibition good enough to get hon-
orable mention at pendleton

  where was this asked conyers
interested

  back some ways-you know that
bend where theres the roots of a
cedar

  sure-kind of waggle up and down
about two miles this side of flanni-
gans

  sure

  huh  conyers jerked a thumb at
his horses theyll do the same at that
bend-fierce i never whale them for
it guess they were whaled there for
something once goin along light with
them i sometimes wish i was carrying
a jag on the wagon to stop a team of
six let alone two

  bill merely nodded but his face was
full of thought

  sure said conyers i always be-
gin a-talkin comforting to them a bit
aliaid as a matter of fact i dont like
the place myself

  neither do i answered bill and
nodded again for some reason he
seemed to see flannigan again and that
drab barroom with the mocking check-
erboard in the corner the disconsolate
rejected dejected inviting and repel-
lent checkerboard

  well guess id better be pulling
out said conyers-and did so toward
midway while bill hauled onto the
road once more and continued his jog-
gle and swing to spring lake

  but what conyers had said about his
horses getting restive at that place two
miles above flannigans stayed with
bill and brought him back to the de-
pression that he had generally left far

behind by this time it struck him that
the whole way was oppressive-the
quiet hushed forest the winding
muffled road grim and terrible as if
something queer might happen any-
where he was in a mood to quit the
job and pull out for a brighter bit of
country more open more colored but
anon the mood departed

  something at that bend i guess is
unpleasant for horses he thought

  he did not admit thatt was partic-
ularly unpleasant for at least one hu-
man being-namely bill davies an
open-air man he felt without being
consciously introspective

iii

  it happened that on his return trip
from spring lake to ridge he had oc-
casion to walk that bit of road alone
not even in the company of horses
with the end of the sunset he had come
to the place the horses did not like
wrestled with them coaxed them and
had just sighted from the hillside the
camping ground at midway when he no-
ticed that there had happened to him
what had never happened before his
big sack of feed from which he filled
the nose bags of his hefty montanas
had joggled off

  back went his thoughts over the road
and he guessed he knew where it lay
it had fallen off when he wrestled with
the animals at their place of fears and
sweats well he would drive down to
the meadow and then return for it for
the load was heavy the horses were
tired and the meadow was in sight so
down he drove to his wonted camp
place and there unhitched the horses
looked round for their nose bags won-
dering what had come to their human
partner of the road

  all right said bill davies i
guess i dropped the grub there
you stop there ill hike back and fetch
it
the queer place



  a plainsman would have spraddled
over even a draft horse for that couple
of miles hike back on the road but bill
feeling stiff in the limbs after his day
on the elevated seat thought to stretch
his legs away he went uphill again
the two beasts turning puzzled to look
after him he swung off stiffly but
soon fell into a plodding stride and
dissipated his exasperation at himself
for having dropped the bag in the exer-
cise of walking to find it

  hints of night were all around it
would be here soon at this place on
the hill up from midway there were
generally many chipmunks disporting
now but one or two chirped and ran and
again chirped thinly knowing that night
was near on bill trudged enjoying
his walk still though to be sure he was
pleased to hear the silver notes of a bob-
olink as if addressed to him they
were antidote to the dark-red dark-
green infestivity of the slopes

  up on the hillside in the forest he
turned and looked down between the
trees he could still see the wagon
with the horses at the tail waiting for
their oats they looked small from
here but he could even make out that
they were still turned toward him-or
turned in the direction in which he had
departed-by the white of their fore-
heads the meadow was going drab
the green fading a shadow seemed to
be drifting across it the horses moved
from the wagon to make shift on grass
as if they were unpampered cayuses
instead of oat-suppered heavyweights
no light yet showed where flannigans
stood to one side backed by trees-but
perhaps it was not yet time for lights
away up on high a peak showed over
the trees with a sullen glow still on it
in the woods however night was fast
getting to business bushes merged in
darkness a drifting subtle darkness
they did not stand forth-they merely
bulked deeper glooms

  and then just before he reached the

bend something suddenly happened to
bill davies in his inner parts and there
were little shivers came over him-for
he felt that he was being looked at

  he pshawed aside this inexplicable
feeling told himself that night was fall-
ing a bit cold and puckered his eyes
more keenly to see where the dropped
sack lay these shivers he had not
felt since childhood in the dark of a
little loft over a farm in indiana where
he had been raised he told himself
again that night was going to be chilly
he could still see ahead though the
cleared cut of the road had a very lone-
some appearance now with the woods
so darkened

  say he must get over this queer
feeling of being looked at he was
just at that bend where his horses had
been walloped once by a former team-
ster somebody was looking at him
and say not only his horses were like
that here what was it conyers had
said to him about the place he peered
left and right as he walked it oc-
curred to him that it would be dark be-
fore he could get back to the meadow
he should have brought a lamp a man
might-well a man might stub a toe
for instance

  pshaw there was nothing to stub a
toe on a man had only to keep walk-
ing in the deep dust of the road he
looked left and right and hiked on
he was at the bend some one was
looking at him-and then his foot in
stepping out impinged on something
soft that yielded and he leaped aside

  the breath jumped out of him he
thought it was a body he had blundered
onto but it was only what he had come
for the sack of horse feed he took
it up he flung it over his shoulder
he started incontinently to hike back
he wanted to run and of course would
not but he was being looked at-and
from behind now

  night had fallen and up in the moun-
tains a long howl wavered-a coyote sa-


the cpocpular magazine

luting the sure night the shivers ran
again in bill davies spine and he could
explain them to himself this time-
not with utter conviction however-as
being caused by that unwarned and dis-
mal cry any fellow feels the melan-
choly unpleasantness of coyotes howls
be he lean or fat town bred or moun-
tain bred

  he was being looked at no no he
was not he told himself he was not-
and believed that he was here was
the meadow glimmering gray and
mighty glad he was to see it he had
never known two such unpleasant miles
there were a few stars beginning to
show here was the meadow with a
sense of openness and here were the
while faces of his horses here was their
whinnying greeting and a little later
there was the sound of their munching
the sound of the crackling camp fire
the sizzling bacon and the appetizing
odor of it

  across the meadow flannigans light
now showed nearer there was an-
other wavering light coming into being
evidently some other teamster had out-
spanned there on the way to spring
lake from ridge bill wanted lots of
dancing light that night and he flung
on much wood after supper if all the
teamsters in the rockies outspanned in
the meadow at midway each with his
own fire bill davies would welcome
them soon he heard gentle whistling
men advancing  another camp are
wont to come with noise a sneeze or a
cough a deliberate tramping on a fallen
branch a whistling or humming of a
bar of song bill shaded his eyes from
the firelight and stared into the dark-
ness

  hello jim he cried

  jim conyers roamed into view

  well its you bill he said i
guessed it would be how you makin
out you look lonesome and he filled
his pipe

  bill was lonesome he had never

been so glad of a companion at the mid-
way camp in all his journeying through
the country he put on another can
of tea for hospitalitys sake and just
as he was measuring out the leaves a
shot rang sharply in the night

  whats that snapped jim and
leaping up he peered in the direction
of the little sparkle and twinkle that
showed where his own camp lay across
the pocket

  it was at flannigans said bill
and wondered why his voice sounded
thick but though his voice was thick
he felt he must find out what the shot
meant both men knew that a shot
from flannigans at this time of night
was not right

  better go over said bill

  maybe cleanin gun and it loaded
said jim maybe shot himself

  better go over said bill again

  they hit across the meadow to the
sparkle of light in the window and then
suddenly the door of flannigans flung
back and there was a dancing dervish
of a figure in the light waving its hands

it was before the days when chinks cut
off their cues and the cue of this fig-
ure let them know that it was flanni-
gans chink agitated in the doorway

he seemed to be in flight then spun
round halted retreated back into the
light then the light was shut off
abruptly the door had closed again

  huh a perplexed grunt came from
each of the men and they strode
smartly across the meadow when they
came to the old hotel they walked to
the window of one accord walked
stealthily now and looked in what
they saw was the chink wringing his
hands on the hither side of the bar	

and on the other side were two men
stooping as if to lift something

  its a holdup cried jim you
aint heeled by any chance billy

  no

  might run a bluff if we do it prop-
erly but-
the queer place



  the two men who were lifting the
burden were suddenly revealed as they
rose humped up

  its captain moyes jim broke out
and the young engineer from the
east thats looking at them prospects
said bill

  they were lifting flannigan they
raised him to the bar they felt his
heart looked at him looked at each
other the engineer frowning spoke
a lot as if hurriedly

  well go in said bill

  they opened the door and entered-
and the first tiling that bill noticed was
the checkerboard lying on the floor face
downward and the men black and
white scattered broadcast the three
living inmates swept round at their en-
trance flannigans hotel seldom saw
boys dropping in long after dark now
twenty-five years ago it was different
even captain moyes started

  hello boys said he recovering
pity you didnt come in sooner-for
witnesses

  oh its clear enough said the tall
man look at the way he grabbed his
gun and we have one witness in the
chinaman

  it was the chink i was thinking of
replied moyes in low tones he might
swear you did it

  whats the racket asked a voice
it was bills he recognized it after
it was out he had a feeling that every-
thing was goiiig to be explained when
he saw the checkerboard upside down
at last the squares hidden the men
scattered he no longer felt that queer
haunting sense in the place

  moyes turned to thompson-smith
as if expecting him to reply to bills
question and that gentleman said

  it is only the end of a long job
there was a man came into this coun-
try over a year ago and was lost sight
of-my brother i never thought we
were like each other but other people
did-

  he did broke in moyes meaning-
fully

  hows that said conyers

  he says that because of what hap-
pened just now answered smith
you see my brother didnt show up
again and he had no reason that i
knew for not showing up again he
wrote to me once or twice from ridge
he was going up in the mountains pros-
pecting then i never heard from him
again i came west a month or two
ago to sec if i could trace him they
knew of him at the assay office in
ridge and he had registered a claim
on palliser creek up there then i
got hold of captain moyes he had
met my brother in the hills and thought
he could find me a place he had been
doing some work in we visited the
registered claim he hadnt been there
for a long time then we hunted over
the hills where captain moyes knew he
had been working last year we found
his camp all right and a bit of a
tunnel it looked as if he had intended
to come back to it of course a man
might have a reason for cutting off
from his family and all old friends a
reason that his own people didnt know
but when we saw that camp captain
moyes and i made sure that my brother
had intended coming back to it of
course men do go into the hills and
never come back men have accidents
as-

  plenty men have said moyes
but all the same-

  all the same went  smith we
argued from that camp that he intended
to come back to it he hadnt run
away from anything i thought that
camp let me know that it was worth
while making inquiries for him cap-
tain moyes suggested that he got his
supplies from flannigan not from
spring lake this is so much nearer
you see his last camp was just up
there and smith waved a hand bill
noticed that he looked white and tired


the cpopular magazine

anyhow we rode down here this
evening we didnt see flannigan-

  sleeping off his tanglefoot put in
moyes

  we had supper and as there was
nothing to do but checkers we sat down
to play flannigan evidently thought
it to get up for the evening then just
half an hour ago he came in to the
bar and- well i never saw any-
thing like it

  hows that  said bill in a strained
voice

  oh answered moyes he just
stared at mr smith here and then
went crazy that man was sodden
with tanglefoot only needed a shock
to put him off his balance he just
started cackling what you doing
there what you doing there-when
i not only shot you but buried you
up jumps mr smith at that i thought
he was done for yes sir-he turned
to smith-i thought you were done
for when he grabbed under the bar i
knew that meant gun

  what happened bill heard con-
yers ask

  smith inclined his head toward

moyes

  we both jumped at him captain
moyes grabbed at his wrist-

  shot himself said conyers

  smith nodded

  thats what answered captain
moyes buf what i want to know is
why and how he killed your brother
and what did he mean about burying
him

  the chinaman now calmed down
was thinking of his own skin he came
a little nearer to the group

  i tell you he said misa flan-
nig he shoot him one night because this
man he kill come in and eat suppah i
give him suppah misa flannig say
what you dlink this man he kill

bleak this man head this man say
he guess not bleak and he jump up-
all same you did they fight this
man knock misa flannig back against
ba misa flannig reach over for gun

  the chinaman paused and captain
moyes spoke hard and keen

  why in thunder didnt you tell the
marshal he asked youve been in
melica long enough to know that eh
oh i scale-i scale misa flan-
nig say if i tell he say i shoot the
man he say he shoot me he say if
i try to go away any time he follow me
he give me money every month i

terrified smile

  thats scare all right-to the limit
said moyes where did he bury this
man you tell me about 

  oh i not know

  come now  guess you helped him
guessed he scared you to help him
too

 yes he scale me he made me
help cally him up on mountainside-
some way along and throw him back

  where was this then

  up on hill west answered the
chinaman you no allest me you
no allest me

  moyes and smith looked at each
other

  if he shows us thats all now i
suppose said smith in a heavy voice
i expect he was terrified anyhow
he didnt do it

 i show you-i show you now i
take lamp and show you-not far two
the queer place



mile up off the road and in a place
all same gulch

  bill davies wet his lips and then
looked at conyers conyers did not
seem to associate his experiences two
miles up with this story at all

  well go up in the morning said
captain moyes

  ill show you-and you not have me
allest whined the chink

  they turned from him thoughtful

  i dont want to sleep here to-night
said moyes how about sleeping at
you fellows camp

  we aint camped together said
billy you come to my camp you
come over too conyers you go and
fetch your blankets well all camp
together there was a note of some-
thing like somber hilarity in his voice

  he was not scaled but this busi-
ness was different from anything that
had ever happened in his life to jim
conyers there might seem no associa-
tion between that disposal of the mur-
dered man and the funk of the horses
up there but to him there was and
he was further silenced over the way
in which the whole thing had come out

  he was a quiet man that night pon-
dering two themes first the way the
horses felt and the way he had felt up
at the bend that very night second
the way that checkerboard has been
mixed up in the affair had he as
well as a keen sense to the presence
of that body up there also the gift of
second-sight did he subconsciously
every time he saw that checkerboard
have a knowledge that through it would

come the exposal it was all too deep
for him but he felt assuredly that
he had got mixed up not superficially
but deeply with a sitfe of things that
could not be seen touched bumped into

  in the morning he did not go up
with moyes and smith to look see
with the chinaman he waited at the
meadow till they and conyers returned
and then he did not need to ask he
read it  their faces only when he
climbed to his seat to pull out for
ridge and conyers gathered his reins
to pull out for spring lake did bill
say to jim was it at the place where
the horses get scared 

  yes said conyers just off the
road there theres a kind of gulch
back a few yards a sudden drop there
was nothing left-the coyotes had seen
to that yes sir i guess the horses
are wise to that crack there horses
have a sense we dont have about some
things i guess theyre scared of get-
ting off the wagon road and down that
bit of precipice we cant see for bush
never knew it was there myself
though bill thought conyers expla-
nation very lame compared with his
own lie did not think that conyers was
exactly fruitful soil for his nebulous
theory so he left it unspoken but he
took special note that the next time he
passed the bend the horses seemed
hardly to know they had arrived at
the spot of their terrors they fidgeted
a little but went  easily and  the
way back a day or two after still they
passed unheeding with no shivers 
veerings at all  signs of funk

out of the rolling mill

an employee of a rolling mill while on his vacation fell in love with a handsome
german girl upon his return to work he went to mr carnegie and
asked for some more time off to get married

    mr carnegie seemed much interested tell me about her he said is
she short or is she tall slender willowy

    well mr carnegie was the answer all i can say is that if id had
the rolling of her id have given her two or three more passes
a venture in private preserves

by raymond s spears
author of bargain day in the cordovameanness in the mountainsetc

             a tussle between the woodsmen and a graduate of wall street who
             was a combination of practical sentiment and opportunism the wall
             street mans attorney insisted that the backwoodsmen needed a lesson-
             which may be true enough but it doesnt do to handle them too roughly

the best hunting and the best fish-
ing in the big woods was up
the creek from seaberry settle-
ment on what is known as the
fiddlebutt patent this patent or land
grant had been made by the state to
a late comer at the wilderness crib back
in  or thereabouts but timothy
butt had widely advertised his land
grant as agricultural lands with the
result that he had sold many thousands
of the original sixty thousand acres
the price he received from the pur-
chasers more than paid him for the
time trouble and five hundred dollars
which he had put into the task of per-
suading the state legislature and the
governor to reward his political and
financial sagacity and faithfulness by
giving him the three score thousand
acres of what were at that time virgin
timberlands and in the selling of which
he had reserved spruce and pine rights

  butt established a sawmill at the set-
tlement where he cut up all the timber
he could find up the creek and in due
course he moved down to the state cap-
ital where his wealth his beautiful
daughter and his political sagacity es-
tablished his family so  well in society
that his son afterward became con-
gressman and his grandson president of
the light and power company of sixty
years later

  in the meanwhile the fiddlebutt pat-

ent after many changes and adventures
finally fell as cut-over lands  ac-
count of unpaid taxes into the hands
of the state as part of the mountain
park and there it remained till james
cobbleman discovered purling stream
and the rippling ponds away up in the
heart of the big woods and far within
fiddlebutt patent

  james cobbleman had invested in
light and power when he was an inno-
cent grist millers son just arrived in
the metropolis with his fortune of
twenty dollars in his leather wallet and
looking for a job in wall street he
had landed as messenger boy in a bucket
shop  new street wall streets
black-shcep brother and there learned
his business

  his knowledge of toll bins yellow
corn buckwheat and other common-
places in a little ten-horse-power grist
mill was to the great advantage of
james cobbleman for he was adapt-
able within limits for instance he
speculated in wheat corn and oats and
thus he obtained while still a very cal-
low youth in appearance several thou-
sand dollars then with his knowledge
of water power acquired while listen-
ing to the clink-clank of the big over-
shot wheel in his fathers mill he
plunged  light and power when
stock was selling all the way from
three-eighths to three-fourths and ac-
a venture in private cpcreselves	

quired ten thousand shares of a par
value of one hundred dollars which
even insiders regarded as the joke of
the day

   but the election of butt to the presi-
dency of light and power was in fact
a masterpiece of finance no one had
ever forgotten the tradition that con-
gressman butt was a pretty shrewd poli-
tician james cobbleman saw his light
and power go to eleven and he sold
out ten thousand shares dumped 
the market all at once alarmed a num-
ber of people and james cobbleman
bought in thirty thousand shares and
had nearly two thousand dollars left for
investment purposes

  there was a streak of poetry in the
soul of james cobbleman he had
loved the sound of the overshot and the
whirring burs light and power mean-
ing water power and electric light had
come to mean more than mere stock
gambling to him the problem of water
power was for him a great joy a great
opportunity and thus before any one
knew it james cobbleman owned fifty-
three per cent of the outstanding stock
of light and power

  that happened when the state legis-
lature was listening to the pleas of tim-
othy butt third who pictured the great
future for industry in the state if the
legislature would only see the great
opportunity they had for developing the
latent water powers

  overnight the legislature dreamed a
dream of lasting fame for commercial
statesmanship like that enjoyed by the
signers of the declaration and james
cobbleman awakened to the discovery
that his sentiment and speculation had
become a pampered public enterprise of
such proportions as he had not dreamed

   his first act was to purchase the mill
which his father had run so many years
and over this mill he erected a magnifi-
cent concrete-and-glass structure to pre-
serve the old overshot the old un-
painted shingles and boards from the

elements which had made them pic-
turesque he scraped out the old
muddy mill pond and lined it with con-
crete and planted concrete tubs on the
bottom with australian lily pads in
them and on the hill overlooking the
scene he built a summer cottage and
his breakfast table on the heights in
brooklyn was served with buckwheat
pancakes all winter long made of flour
ground in the old mill in the old slow
burs-the only toil they now ever had
to perform except for the slow grind-
ing of a few bushels of yellow com
for johnnycake and fried cornmeal
mush

  thus james cobbleman was a creature
of practical sentiment and opportunism
when he had arrived at a junior part-
nership in the new street bucket shop
known to his biographers as a broker-
age business he came to seaberry set-
tlement seeking a little modest woods
sport he came up into the big woods
to catch brook trout shoot deer from
the bow of a skiff at night and other-
wise amuse himself during his vacation

  year after year he came to seaberry
and little by little he ventured deeper
into the woods at first he hired lem
lawson as his guide and then pros-
perity increasing he took bill borson
into the woods with him these two
men were his faithful servitors they
took him where the fish were largest
and the deer easiest to kill they ini-
tiated him into the mysteries of the
salt lick the bale-wire snare and the
use of a young mouse as bait for a four-
pound brook trout

  lem lawson was a long lank woods-
man with a large nose a freckled face
and a blue eye he earned his three
dollars and fifty cents a day guiding
and he trapped his five hundred dol-
lars worth of fur a winter once he
accepted james cobblemans cordial in-
vitation to come down to new york
and visit him

  lem went cobbleman now the head


the vovulacr magazine

of a firm that rented a suite of thou-
sand-dollar rooms from itself in the
building that it owned was sincerely
glad to have lem come down to visit
him he not only tried to give lem
the time of bis life he called in some
of his friends to help entertain the sim-
ple-hearted backwoodsman

  lem would never tell what he did
or what happened but his friends in
the settlement saw a piece in the
weekly newspaper saying that a man
named lem lawson from the big
woods had gone on a spree in new
york and that four policemen and sev-
eral prominent new york clubmen had
hardly been able to restrain him

  there were pale yellow scars on
lems face when he returned from new
york and he wore a new suit of clothes
of such good quality that he wore them
for more than five years steady every
day winter and summer lem ad-
mitted that the clothes had been made
to order for him at cobblemans ex-
pense but that was all he would admit
beyond saying that new york was
darned hard on a mans clothes

  lem from that time onward always
regarded james cobbleman with covert
but keen suspicion little by little bill
borson became cobblemans favorite
guide borson was not of lawsons
stalwart mental mold the time came
when lawson having been elected road
commissioner and a member of the
county board of supervisors ceased
going into the woods with cobbleman
in other words lem had gone into
politics

  cobbleman year after year went up
purling stream to rippling ponds
where he had bill borson build him a
log camp and supply it with boats uten-
sils spring cots and other fixings he
was little disturbed by other woods
roamers because the ponds and stream
were so far back in the woods that other
hunters and fishermen were satisfied

with what they found nearer the clear-
ings

  but one day on his way out from
rippling ponds cobbleman met a gang
of men and a tote wagon heading up
purling stream he stopped casually
to talk to the men and discovered that
they were going to build a log camp up
the stream at the first stillwater and
that they were going to log the whole
danged valley

  cobbleman long schooled in keeping
his mouth shut made no comment
casually an hour or two later he asked
borson who owned that part of the
country

  why this is all state land up here
borson answered thats old dave
nabens gang hes the biggest timber
thief that ever walked up in this coun-
try

  then he doesnt own the woods up
purling stream

 own the timber up there huh
he doesnt even own the horses on that
wagon he dassent if he did some
of them he owes would sure levy onto
it but hes in politics thats why
they leave him alone

  i see cobbleman nodded this
looks like a bear track here-

  by ginger it is and an old whale
too come this fall an well set a
trap fer him borson exclaimed for-
getting the timber business

  not so with cobbleman three days
later his power-rights attorney came up
to tisbits the county seat and selected
poul vetch  kipe to do certain
land business for a client in the metrop-
olis poul vetch  kipe had talked
among themselves ever since they or-
ganized what they would do if a big
fellow ever came along and gave them
a case

  they were all ready for cobblemans
business and they knew exactly what
to do in three days they had located
the owners of certain outstanding prop-
erty rights in the fiddlebutt patent
a venture in cpcrivate preserves	

they bought them in then they ran-
sacked the state tax-sale lists for sixty
years and obtained in that way more
rights and quitclaims and comptrollers
deeds of sale

  they located the old and neglected
deeds which had been transferred by the
original butt to a sawmill owner who
had in turn sold them to a speculator
who had died and left them to his
widow who had one daughter who sold
the old paper for one hundred dollars
because as the shrewd attorneys as-
sured her it was worth no more since
the lands had long since been sold for
taxes it would be vain to tell how
these bright young attorneys signed up
scattered heirs from boston to liver-
pool and from diisseldorf to new
south wales

  in the state comptrollers office there
was a man of convivial habits and ex-
piring term of office to him the young
attorneys went and gave a supper
they gave him a farewell party for
this was on the last night but one
before his term expired during the
course of the dinner the comptroller
signed a statement saying that all the
state claims in the fiddlebutt patent
were of no value and that they were
null and void in view of the fact that
certain heirs and assigns had proved
to him in person that their claims were
right and just and that great harm
would be done if the state continued to
claim these properties which the state
had been holding ever since 

  poul carried the result of the legal
firms efforts to cobblemans office
poul placed upon the great magnates
desk five folio volumes of papers maps
and documents

  there mr cobbleman the attor-
ney said are the papers in the matter
of the fiddlebutt patent with regard
to lots nos     and  there
is some question of hardly any import
we traced robert venner into chil-
coot pass where he unquestionably died

  b

in an avalanche without heirs which
releases no  in the matter of no 
there is some question as to whether the
bones of a man beside the borax trail
in death valley really belonged to the

sole remaining heir of lot no -

  how much cobbleman asked ab-
ruptly

  nine cents an acre for sixty thou-
sand acres-

  what nine cents

  yes exactly

 but good lord-

  its worth five dollars an acre of
course thats what the state is assess-
ing those lands at but the state comp-
troller-

 never mind never mind im
honest-i never did a crooked thing in
my life i dont want to know a danged
thing about this cobbleman hastened
to exclaim ill draw you a check
make your fee large enough for gods
sake i want men like you  my side
the modest fee of the law firm
amounted only to enough to make the
cost of almost virgin big woods timber
twelve cents an acre or seven thousand
two hundred dollars for sixty thou-
sand acres of forest land before the
attorney left the office on wall street
he had received his instructions and
within forty-eight hours thereafter
old dave naben came trembling into
the office of poul vetch  kipe

  i hope to die he cried i thought
all that land up purling stream was
state land you know i aint never
bothered none to amount to anything
with private lands that aint safe an
i know it say ive always been a
friend of you fellers cant you make
it right with mr cobbleman f id
a knowed he had any claim onto that
land id a seen myself parbiled in

hades fore id-

 how many trees have you cut
kipe asked sharply

  they aint but eight thousand you
see i hadnt got started rightly ive


the popular magazine

jest ben cuttin a road up through and
gittin ready for next year say youll
put in a good word for me wont you 

  this stealing trees from the private
park of a very wealthy man is exceed-
ingly serious kipe answered gravely
the facts will be placed before him
however i believe that personally he
is a very kindly man

  this was cold comfort but after
some weeks of anxiety old dave was
elated to learn that cobbleman was in-
clined to be lenient then cobbleman
on further consideration decided not
to press the charges against the logger
provided he cleared up the muss he had
made and did not remove the logs

  cobblemans private park was a re-
ality and he thought of planning a fine
camp for a site on the rippling
ponds and other little camps here and
there through the woods

  itll cost five or six thousand to run
it he thought to himself but i guess
i can stand the shot now

  bill borson had already been en-
gaged as park superintendent and he
had hired four wardens to keep fiddle-
butt patent clear of trespassers and
their first real capture was lem law-
son who had run a trap line up the
creek up burling stream to rippling
ponds they caught lem dead to
rights too for when they arrived at the
camp with a state game warden lem
was cutting a slice off a frozen haunch
of venison

  very much elated for he was long
an enemy of lem bill borson took him
right down to the county seat where
he was arraigned before justice of
peace kipe attorney kipes father and
fined one hundred dollars for killing a
deer out of season thirty-eight dollars
for cutting trees on the land and twen-
ty-five dollars for trespass

  i guess thats taught you a lesson
borson remarked in an undertone as
lem started to leave the little court-
room and fifteen minutes later lem

paid an additional fine of ten dollars
for disturbing the peace and contempt
of court

  those backwoodsmen need a les-
son attorney poul remarked to the
spectators theyre ignorant and you
got to hit em hard

  theres others beside woodsmen
needs a lesson a quiet young man sug-
gested i know those woodsmen and
it dont do to handle them too rough

  poo-o poul grunted as he turned
away

  there were two or three other arrests
on the fiddlebutt patent down to the
time of lake fishing early in may but
by the time rift fishing came in those
deep woods in early june there was
hardly a footprint upon the old roads
except where the park wardens made
their way up and down the trails

  thus when james cobbleman came
up to enjoy his new purchase he found
the vast tract silent and deserted he
could look about him and feel assured
that no one would break in upon his
isolation and contented hermitage
hunters fishermen campers would not
come to disturb him in his retreat and
borson kept himself and his wardens
far in the background so that the man
could have the rest and enjoy the peace
that he craved

  on his way out as he came down to
the clearing above seaberry settlement
cobbleman met a surveyor and stake
drivers lem lawson stood beside the
instrument and when the preserve
owner came along lem turned his head
away but cobbleman would not stand
for that

  whats the matter with you lem
whats your grouch of course i had
you fined for trespass killing deer and
cutting timber-but why shouldnt i
the way youve scowled around and
played the baby act come now for-
get it what are you doing

  lem hesitated for the fraction of a
second lem was a politician and
a venture in private preserves



when lie turned there was a smile on his
face as lie answered

  were surveying out a road up the

creek a ways-

  is that so well thats good
there ought to be a road up the creek
itll save lots of work-lots of it im

a taxpayer here in this-this town-

  town

  thats it-town probably the
heaviest taxpayer youve got im glad
to pay my share of the taxes-i am in-
deed we need roads

  im sure glad you like the idea

lem answered i didnt know-

  now look here lem im public-
spirited go ahead with the road and
say come down to new york to see me
when you get the road done will you
i cant get up before next spring-got
to go dpvvii to the amazon river and
look into the falls down there may
start a power plant down there but
you come down in february eh 

  so cobbleman parted from lem in
the best of spirits and lem looked after
him till he was out of sight down the
road lem too smiled

  you heard what he said about being
glad to have a road built up the creek
and being glad to pay his share of the
taxes lem asked the surveyor

  that  did the man answered jot-
ting down a figure or two in his book
the surveyor was not a politician

  well you go on with the line up the
old road ill catch up with you

  lem returned home and arrived in
seaberry settlement just as the dust of
cobblemans rig was settling in the bend
of the road below the dead and decay-
ing old logging town lem spent a
busy afternoon writing letters on his
printed stationery and when he drove
up after the surveyor that afternoon
late he was tired with so much head-
work

  however lem was contented
within a week his mail had increased
considerably in size and two weeks

later a telephone message came from
feltny on the railroad twenty miles
away that five carloads of road machin-
ery had arrived there lem came down
the following day with twenty-two
teams of horses and one hundred and
sixty-eight men including a timekeeper
and a clerk

  gee look at those hicks some-
body exclaimed must be the whole
danged seaberry settlement crowd
the seaberry settlement crowd a
bystander snorted thats all of sea-
berry settlement polunk and debresse
too thats the whole town of sea-
berry if i know anything about that
part of the woods

  lem was all business a road roller
was run down a trestle and the road-
machinery expert fired its boiler a
big stone crusher a stone screen and a
big crude-oil engine were run down to
the level of the roads

  the strangest procession ever seen in
the big woods headed up the creek
with the road roller towing the stone
hopper and horses snorting and strain-
ing at the tugs to haul their allotted
loads toward the town of seaberry the
joke of the backwoods towns

  progress has sure hit you fellers
lem suggested town clerk bahvick
of dairy town next we know youll
have iron bridges up there with con-
crete abutments

  eh lem remarked and stared at
the town clerk adding thats so i
hadnt thought a danged thing about
bridges

  he left his hauling gang in charge
of the foreman he had appointed and
returned to feltny there he used the
long-distance telephone

  it took four days for the gang to
move the road machinery up to the
little brook that marked the town line
of seaberry there lem called a halt
the road-machinery experts set up the
stone crusher and showed the woods-


the cpocpular magazine

men how to use road scrapers and
dynamite

  in a straight purplish-brown line
there appeared a gasli through the scat-
tered timber and mossy clearings of the
town of seaberry it extended up the
creek valley witli long sweeps over long
ridges and great beautiful curves
around the foot of mountain and val-
ley bend

  from six towns around came hun-
dreds of loggers to swamp the timber
out of the way to uproot stumps and
to hoist glacial bowlders with shattering
charges of dynamite

  behind the swampers came the ditch-
ers and then the levelers and after
them came the great loads of blue-gray
granite sparkling with diamondlike
gleams as the sunlight struck the mica
flakes

  only the far boom of the blasting
reached the outside world now and
then a road maker coming down to
the outer world would tell about the
work going on up in the town of sea-
berry but nobody believed the wild
tales that were rumored around the
idea of seaberry improving its roads
was too good a joke even for those who
saw carloads of cement bridge iron
and road machinery that still came in
to feltny at frequent intervals ad-
dressed to lem lawson road commis-
sioner

  lem worked the machinery night and
day in eight-hour shifts he had a lit-
tle dynamo for lights brought up and
started it going by a splash-dam flume
and mill wheel that would have de-
lighted james cobbleman for its primi-
tive arrangement and effective sim-
plicity

  they laid the road up into the woods
at the rate of two miles a week they
sent one fork up purling stream trail
and another up the creek they built
in all thirty miles of road and when
lem and his clerk went through the
bills and papers he was proud to see

that the books all balanced and all co-
incided there wasnt a cent of graft
in the whole business and every man
had done a days labor and every team
had worked its full stint

  thar lem said that jobs done
now for the board of supervisors

  lem grinned as he thought upon the
subject he had paid the men off as
late as possible in the season he had
signed them up for season contracts
for labor and for horses only six or
seven thousand dollars in orders came
down into the banks of the valley for
discounting and as they were scat-
tered through six or eight banks there
was no excitement in financial or polit-
ical quarters even though rumors had
been running around

  lem had signed contracts for the
town of seaberry for road machinery
and bridge work and other articles nec-
essary for repairs they were payable
upon presentation to the board of su-
pervisors for warrants

  the board of supervisors met in wil-
let the county seat on december th
two days before the board met gentle-
men of excellent appearance and garb
began to put up at the hotel they
made inquiries as to the whereabouts
of the board of supervisors chambers
they met the supervisors as they came
to town when they learned of one an-
others presence on the scene there
were upward of twenty-six representa-
tives of firms in various parts of the
country crowded behind the rail on the
day in the chambers and every bank
in the valley had a representative pres-
ent to ask if the credit of the town of
seaberry would stand the strain

  why yes the supervisors snorted
theyve any quantity of wild lands up
there to tax sure its all right whats
lem been up to now i hear hes done
a bit of road fixing up there

  yes by gad he has the banker
muttered wiping his forehead weve
a venture in private cpresecrves	

got nine thousand in orders discounted
on seaberry

  what a supervisor gasped nine

thousand i hadnt-

  being a politician this supervisor
passed the word around to the other su-
pervisors not to do any talking it was
a warning sped just in time the super-
visors shut their mouths as tight as
steel traps among themselves they
whispered till the annual meeting was
called to order lem was the only one
who did  whispering when the roll
was called lie answered and when the
chairman began to read out the list of
committee appointees lem begged to
be excused from the committee on au-
dits but remarked that he would like
to swap places with some member of
the roads and bridge committee

  i expect roads and bridges will be
interesting he added naively as he
took his seat

  immediately after the committee ap-
pointments were announced the board
went into executive session and all the
spectators howled but they had to leave
the room nevertheless then lem told
the board that he had made some emer-
gency road repairs and that he had
found it necessary to extend certain of
his roads into the woods in order to
enable his constituents to enjoy the free-
dom of the wilderness

  supervisors who had had experiences
with private parks understood the situa-
tion exactly on motion of one of the
woods supervisors mr lem lawsons
books were immediately taken under
consideration by the board acting as a
committee of audits as a whole

  how much is them bills the su-
pervisor from dairy town asked

  three hundred sixty-four thousand
seven hundred an leven dollars an
forty-nine cents lem answered glibly

  jerusalem crickets three voices
cried and other supervisors seized their
desks or chairs

 its moreii the dad-blasted towns
 assessed at somebody exclaimed

no sir lem remonstrated we
got moren that in wild lands-state
an-an private preserves

 several laughed cacklingly and the
 supervisor from dairy town as was
 his privilege took the floor

 i move the bills of the town of sca-
 berry be accepted placed in audit and
 assessed against the taxable property in
 that town thats all the bills you gat
 this year aint it lem

we aint done nothin else up
there lem replied we aint got
a single poor account in town

 whatll the tax rate be some one
 asked

 i figured it at  per cent
 lem answered thats all right too

 gosh several exploded youll
 all be sold out for taxes next comp-
 trollers sale one added

 i hope so lem answered sincerely
 lem plays great politics some one
 muttered hed make a dandy county
 sheriff

 the tax collector of the town of sea-
 berry according to law and the request
 formally made by james cobbleman
 mailed to that property holder his cus-
 tomary tax notice which read

william borson junior

 janies cobbleman in due course saw
 the simple postal card on which the col-
 lector had presented the town bill for
 taxes when he read it he thought at
 first that he was a victim of an optical
 illusion but seeing the reality he
 seized the telephone and demanded to


the popular magazine

 be connected with poul vetch  kipe
 three hundred miles distant

  whats that mean he asked his
attorneys and vetch explained the sit-
uation

  supervisor lawson under the good-
roads code took advantage of a loop-
hole in the law and repaired the roads
in his town at the rate of about ten
thousand dollars a mile vetch said

  but i wont pay no such tax as
that cobbleman exploded

  then the property will be sold for
taxes according to the law vetch ex-
plained

  let em and be dad-blasted to
them cobbleman swore what are
you fellows doing up there letting them
pull that game off on me how many
times can they do that

  well according to the constitution
of-

  oh hades say you fellows send

your bill-ive quit up there see i
aint going to feed all the grafters-

  sir

  it was with great satisfaction that
supervisor lem lawson received from
the comptroller the subsequent notice
of tax sales for the tax periods of five
years

  one line appeared in this document
following a long list of lots sections
quarters and other land designations
terminating with

  all of the town of seaberry sixty-seven
thousand acres excepting thirty-three thou-
sand acres state lands

  say lem the postmaster hailed
after a deep silence i hear they wants
you to be sheriff down below what is
there to it

  oh im satisfied lem answered
carelessly if the boys leave me be
supervisor and road commissioner i
aint got no kick cornin

  the far and lonely hill

               by h h knibbs

 wer  the panamint we rode the range together

     three as lively buckaroos as ever sat a hoss

 playin jokes and singin songs in every kind of weather

 and anything we tackled it sure had to come across

 sage a-blinkin in the rain sun just breakin cover

 tail to wind the ponies standin thoughtfullike and still

 while across the evenin comes the cheepin of the plover
 hidin in the shadows of the far and lonely hill

 funny how we never saw that it was drawin nearer

 edgin closer every day-that lonely hill it came

 wakin in the sunshine we could sec it big and clearer

 but we kept a-ridin and a-singin just the same

 little owls a-lookin back solemnlike and blinkin

 sun just dancin on the sand and burnin out the grass

 summer round the water holes the crowdin steers all drinkin

 just before we drift em to the range beyond the pass

 seems we didnt sing so much-ropes they did the singin

 ponies feet they played the tune other riders told
 all the yarns and played the jokes that set the laugh a-ringin-

 even then we didnt know that we was growin old

 mighty sudden then it came each range knows the story-

 millin in a thunderstorm hoss and rider down   

 white and still we found him where he took the trail to glory
 wondered if for just plumb grit they handed him his crown 

 two of us was left to ride the panamint together

 settin by the fire at night thoughtfullike and still

 gettin so we noticed every little change of weather

 and shiverin in the shadow of that far and lonely hill

 knew we had to climb it knew the trail was mighty narrow

 so we made a handshake on it that the next to go that way
 would kind of blaze the turns with our old brand the double arrow
 so the last one crossin over wouldnt lose the trail and stray

 down below i sec the herd and dust a-rollin nigher

 in the morning on the panamint where once we used to ride

 but my hoss is frettin on the bit we cant go any higher

 so i reckon if we got to go its down the other side

 sage a-blinkin in the rain sun just breakin cover

 all around the ranges mighty peacefullike and still

 from the other valley comes the callin of the plover

 and i see the double arrow pointin down the lonely hill
 the girl from nowhere

by george woodruff johnston

author of the hidden clew etc

the clew to the mystery of the missing ruby lay in the answer to the
question where was the girl from nowhere when the lights went out

a hard day at the hospital fol-
lowed by four acts of a tedi-
ous problem play had made
me very drowsy and under the
impression that the meek white-faced
man leaning over me was a patient who
had entered my office unannounced i
came within an ace of shaking hands
with him and offering him a chair but
luckily at this juncture by wife tapped
my foot under the table and with a
start i reawoke to the fact that i was
one of a large after-theater supper party
at mrs cartrights house in wash-
ington place and discovered that the
man i was preparing to greet so cordi-
ally was the butler about to fill my glass
with some of her famous chamberlin
 also became conscious that a woman
was talking it was mrs letterby i
should have recognized that thin high-
pitched voice of hers anywhere-the
voice of one who takes life hard and
finds no humor in it

  yes thats my daughter thats
ethel in blue at the far end of the
table next to young hapwood she was
saying proudly to all whom it might
concern she came home last week-
finished school you know

  really god bless my soul how the
kiddies do grow up this in a rum-
bling bass from john limpet a big man
with a fat impressive face who was
mrs cartrights attorney and though
a lion in the courtroom was the most
amiable of lambs in social life

  dont they sighed mrs letterby
im glad to have ethel at home of
course but-lowering her tone a trifle
-shes brought a schoolmate with her
who i fear is going to prove a great
responsibility at this she sighed again
and glanced around in search of sym-
pathy

  responsibility too bad but none
of us can shirk it can we murmured
limpet consolingly holding his glass of
rich red wine up to the light by the
way he added is the girl here-the
one you speak of i dont remember
meeting her at the theater

  yes mrs letterby replied shes
sitting on the other side of young hap-
wood-the frail dreamy-looking girl
with brown hair and eyes dressed in
white dont you think her rather
pretty doctor dannart she asked
turning to me

  very i was able to answer truth-
fully

  now the curious thing about the
girl is this continued mrs letterby
in a voice which traveled much farther
than she thought it did when she
was quite a child a man supposedly her
father brought her to miss ribbons
boarding school and left her there that
was in old miss lavinia ribbons day
her nieces have the school now and
the girl has been there ever since shes
never had any other home she doesnt
even know who she is or where she
comes from
the girl fcrom nowhere



  you might call her the girl from
nowhere then said limpet good-hu-
moredly

  you might certainly agreed mrs
letterby she calls herself madge
carrick however

  what became of the man asked
bessington who had become a father
for the first time a month or two be-
fore and was conscious of a rapidly
awakening paternal instinct

  vanished exclaimed mrs let-
terby melodramatically he kissed the
child good-by put on his hat and
walked out of the door into-oblivion
a subdued murmur of horror at
thought of such unnatural conduct on
the part of a male parent arose from
among the mothers at our end of the
table which murmur gave way to lazy
laughter when tony habersham said a
bit too loudly to a neighbor what the
deuce does a fellow want in oblivion
with a hat i should like to know

  but mrs letterby had her revenge
she immediately fixed tony with her
compelling eye and incidentally our
hostess mrs cartright next to whom
he sat

  its all ethels fault she told them
querulously i mean about asking the
girl to stay with us and loading me with
the responsibility of looking after her
thats the trouble with ethel-shes so
soft-hearted it began with stray kit-
tens and things shed bring home and
now its this stray girl why i remem-
ber a blind beggar-

  but i had heard all this a hundred
times before-the history of the plain
and futile ethel as recounted by her
loving mother-and my attention wan-
dered to mrs cartright who had tem-
porarily detached herself from mrs
letterby and shivering slightly was
speaking over her shoulder to a foot-
man

  mrs cartright was a widow won-
derfully beautiful in an opulent exotic
way sleepy-eyed indolent and care-

less she had a temper all the same
which would flare up in spite of her at
the most inopportune and unexpected
moments but her friends readily par-
doned her and forgot for they knew
how kind how forgiving how absurdly
generous she really was and how the
memory of these tropic outbursts mor-
tified and distressed her

  she had finished with the footman
now and sat there listening indulgently
to mrs letterbys rigmarole a great
pear-shaped ruby-the glorious sun of
ceylon-hanging about her neck by a
slender chain and burning on her breast

  did you hear doctor dannart she
asked catching my eye and smiling
slowly in a way there is something
sad almost tragic in mrs letterbys
story of this girl

  i should think so the latter de-
clared motioning the butler not to fill
her glass again the money thats
been sent her twice a year from some
unknown source answered well enough
while she was at boarding school but
here comes the pinch madge carrick
has grown up with rich girls shes
learned their ways but now that shes
done with school she cant go  with
the life theyll lead-not  the amount
shes been getting heretofore its im-
possible 

  rather a bad fix madge is in-not
exclaimed tony habersham ingenu-
ously knew a girl like that once-
went to the bowwows

  at this moment mrs cartright with
a nod rose from the table those who
had seen her signal followed her ex-
ample others who had not remained
seated and there was a brief period of
confusion

  as i pushed back my chair i ob-
served that a maid had appeared from
behind the screen in front of the pantry
door and-probably in response to an
order given the footman-was ap-
proaching her mistress with the evident
intent of laying about her shoulders a


the cpocpulacr magazine

silvery wisp of lace she carried in her
hand

  and then without an instants warn-
ing the lights went out and the room
was plunged in total darkness

  look out girls we are going
through a tunnel i heard some one
say	p

  at this there was a general laugh fol-
lowed immediately by a shrill scream
and a heavy fall

ii

  in a twinkling i awoke from the
drowsy state in which i had just now
found myself and instinctively leaped
to my feet and dragged aside the heavy
curtains of a tall french window a few
steps back of my place thereupon the
pallid sheen of the electric lamps in the
street flooded the room and dimly illu-
mined it turning quickly i saw a blot
of shadow on the floor my fellow guests
-some rising from the table others
clustered about it-and farther off a
vague figure in rapid motion

  stop i cricd who are you
there  what are you after 

  the form halted and a voice replied
im the underfootman sir i was
going to see what ails the lights

  stand still ill do it said i
where is the switch

  the lamps in brackets along the walls
had not been burning-only the shaded
electric candles bn the table but fol-
lowing the mans directions i soon
found the buttons controlling each and
with two pushes the room was bril-
liantly illuminated

  hello ejaculated bessington lean-
ing over the back of his chair some
ones hurt

   glanced down it was the maid
stretched out flat on the floor and look-
ing rather white but as i stepped to-
ward her she sat up arranged her
skirts and scrambled to her feet i no-
ticed that she still held the scarf which

she had been about to lay on mrs cart-
rights shoulders when the room went
dark

  has anything happened doctor
dannart cried mrs letterby nerv-
ously

  for a moment we all gazed search-
ingly at one another expecting to find
we knew not what then some of the
women began to chatter

  nothings happened apparently i
reassured my questioner but some
one screamed who was it 

  there was no reply

  thats odd i certainly heard a
womans shriek sure it wasnt you
i asked the maid

  yes sir-no sir i mean-i didnt
scream she answered confusedly

  not hurt

  no sir

  did you trip in the dark  how did
you come to be on the floor anyhow
i eyed the girl suspiciously

  i fell sir it was like some one
threw me down

  i was probably responsible for that
young hapwood explained when i
heard the yell i jumped up and
knocked against somebody

  to me this seemed plausible hap-
wood had been sitting between ethel
letterby and her friend madge gar-
rick and when i first saw the maid she
was lying directly behind his chair

  that may be i conceded but
how about the lamps there was noth-
ing wrong with the current some one
switched them off who uas it

  as before there was no answer to my
question

  well said i annoyed its plain
the house is haunted we hear a
scream but no one gave it the lights
are turned out but no one did it

  as i finished speaking i discovered
that mrs cartright unobserved by the
others was beckoning to me her
sleepy eyes were blazing now and her
indolent body was tense and quivering
the grl from nowhere



with excitement as she stood alone by
the great mantelpiece at the end of the
room one hand outstretched across her
bosom

  whats wrong i asked anxiously

  without a word she turned her back
on the rest and let fall her hand

  the ruby was gone

  not that i exclaimed amazed hor-
rified

  yes-an outrage-in my own house
-at my own table she stammered
vainly trying to control herself none
of the servants would have done this-
they have been with me too long and
why rob me now by force i am care-
less forgetful they have had would
have a thousand better opportunities

  by force it was you then who
screamed i queried

  yes see this

  thereupon she unclasped her other
hand disclosing the chain by which the
gem had hung and i quickly noted
that fragile as they seemed the links
had held and that it was the ring to
which the ruby had been attached that
had parted then she pointed to a red
line at the back and left side of her neck
where the chain in response to the jerk
upon it had bruised the soft white skin

  in a flash i turned about

  please stay where you are i
begged everybody i mean  no one
must leave the room and kindly touch
nothing disturb nothing then i
called limpet arid while the rest looked
on puzzled we three hurriedly dis-
cussed what was to be done

  at first mrs cartright was wholly
unmanageable her inflammable tem-
per had got the best of her and she
would hear of nothing but the police
but finally our quieting influence pre-
vailed and facing the others who were
still grouped about the table i said
calmly

  i am sorry to say mrs cartright
has lost her ruby-the sun of ceylon
it disappeared when the lights went out

now this sort of thing is horribly awk-
ward its embarrassing to her to all
of us what shall we do about it

  this statement of mine as noncom-
mittal as it was effected an immediate
change in the atmosphere of the room
and suspicion like a blight fell upon
all within it mrs cartrights guests
began to stare blankly about them and
to draw ever so little away from one
another mrs letterby sank into her
chair and calling her daughter to her
side dampened a fine lace handkerchief
with a few perfunctory tears tony
habersham who knew-and was aware
that every one else knew-what thin
financial ice he was skating  and in
what desperate need he stood of money
in any form-lost some of his airy man-
ner even the servants were influenced
by the disclosure that had just been
made the butler a pallid middle-aged
man of meek and lowly look was obvi-
ously unstrung and fussed about fum-
bling with wineglasses and rumpled
napkins and other litter of the meal that
still remained upon the table the maid
stood folding and unfolding mrs cart-
rights scarf twenty times a minute as
she kept an anxious eye fixed on the
younger footman-he who had been so
quick about the lights only the older
of the two footmen retained a measure
of his usual stolidity yet seemed afraid
to venture from the safe harbor he had
found near the sideboard

  well whats to be done i re-
peated its getting late or rather
early and weve got to clear this thing
up somehow what do you suggest
bessington 

  you can search me replied the lat-
ter with a shrug i havent got the
ruby

  but not me declared mrs bessing-
ton taking her husband literally id
die before id submit to such an indig-
nity 

  mrs cartright frowned angrily and
started to speak but i broke in before


the vovulatr magazine

she had opportunity to make matters
worse

  before we talk about searching any-
body i proposed let us give the per-
son who took the gem a chance to re-
turn it ill switch off the lights and
hope indeed expect that when i turn
them on again well find the ruby lying
on the table if we dont-well its
mrs cartrights property and this is
her house and each of us for his own
sake and the sake of the rest will have
to do as she wishes-guests and serv-
ants alike

  after a moments delay i closed the
window curtains then pressed the two
black electric buttons and again the
room was plunged in darkness i slowly
counted ten and once more switched
the current 

  there was no sign of the ruby

  everybody was now collected about
the table peering down at it as if hyp-
notized only one person was seated-
the girl madge carrick she occupied
her former place and as my eyes
roamed about to make quite sure
whether or  the gem had been re-
stored i was immediately struck by her
appearance she sat leaning forward
staring in front of her her head in her
hands and as i watched she shivered
started to go to mrs letterby changed
her mind and sank into her chair again
letting her arms fall hopelessly upon the
table

  a little pressure-just a little pres-
sure my dear young miss from no-
where  i heard in a rumbling whisper
over my shoulder and without turn-
ing around i knew that limpet too
had seen the girls discomfiture and
that with cold immobile face and half-
closed eyes he was regarding her as he
did those witnesses whom he purposed
presently to flay alive

  hold  man i expostulated
that may be fright worry-anything
on the poor young ones face-but it
isnt guilt

  if not guilt its guilty knowledge
he rejoined you cant fool me ive
seen too many of em where was she
when the lights went out

  i give it up i was pretty nearly
asleep and hardly knew where i was
myself

  hum ill find out then

  smiling in friendly fashion he next
spoke loud enough for all to hear

  doctor dannart said he in an easy
natural voice predicted that this would
turn out to be an embarrassing situa-
tion for all of us and it would have
proved so had it not been for mrs
cartrights good sense and her desire
that none of her guests should be in-the
least annoyed by reason of her loss
that was not according to the facts
but it got over for now it was limpet
in his role of jury lawyer who was talk-
ing one who could make you see black
as white if he only tried hard enough

  happily the mystery of the miss-
ing ruby has been solved-or nearly-
solved he continued affably but be-
fore we bid mrs cartright good night
and she thanks you for all the patience
and forbearance you have shown i shall
ask you to do one thing for me will
each of you stand or sit in the place you
occupied at the moment the room went
dark you would oblige me immensely
by doing so

iii

  after some confusion and delay the
scene limpet wished reenacted was set
and i observed that mrs cartright the
central figure having passed from the
head almost to the foot of the table on
her way to the door had at the moment
indicated reached a point opposite the
place occupied by ethel letterby she
stood there now the maid a little be-
hind and a little to the right of her-
directly back of young hapwoods
chair it is true but so far from it that
he could not possibly have knocked
the girl from nowhere



against her when she sprang up some
of the guests had preceded mrs cart-
right others followed her while most
of them still hung about the table
among the last was mrs letterby and
behind her waited the butler whose
proffer of wine she had so recently de-
clined one footman hovered near the
sideboard  his fellow who had claimed
when i stopped him to be on his way
to the electric switch could not remem-
ber exactly where he was when dark-
ness overtook him

  remarkable thing said i to lim-
pet  every one except the maid fights
shy of the position at mrs cart rights
right hand yet to judge from the loca-
tion of the bruises on her neck the tug
on the chain must have come from the
right and a little in front of her

  limpet paid no attention to my re-
mark and i saw that his eyes were still
fixed on madge carrick as i had al-
ready noted whereas guests and serv-
ants alike had all shown more or less
interest in the reproduction of the scene
desired she had sat there motionless in
her place nervous brooding obviously
the prey of an ever-increasing distress
of mind of course the inevitable hap-
pened-her mere attitude made her con-
spicuous among the rest and soon not
only limpet but all the others were re-
garding her dubiously conscious of
this she flushed paled and sprang up
as if to rush from the room but imme-
diately sank back into her chair again

  if at this juncture some one had only
moved had only spoken there is no tell-
ing what next she might have done but
the deadly silence and the spying of all
those strange unsympathetic eyes were
too much for her and she broke down
limpet was getting help from every side
in the little pressure he deemed so
efficacious

  oh why do you all stare at me like
that she cried in futile exasperation
but i know you think i took the
ruby i did not i did not and

then she covered her eyes and moaned
helplessly

  ethel letterby pushed aside her
mothers detaining hand and ran to the
girl and put her arm about her and
this seemed to give her a little courage

  then limpet spoke my dear he
inquired suavely where were you
when the lamps went out 

  i was just getting up-getting up
she stammered to thank mrs cart-
right i had never been to the theater
before i had never been to a supper
party before i had never been away
from school-anywhere i was going
to thank her-she had been so sweet-
to ask me

  that was very nice of you-very
nice indeed my dear he continued
but it isnt too late now to show your
appreciation just tell mrs cartright
where the ruby is you couldnt thank
her in any neater way and you know
where it is i can read it in your face
that face was twitching now and
tears filled the girls eyes but she
neither moved nor spoke

  come wont you tell her

  no answer

  why will you persist in being un-
kind to one who has been kind to you 
limpet asked gently

  its because you would then suspect
me all the more of having taken it the
tortured girl burst out oh is there
no one who will help me she cried
looking wildly about her no no
except for ethel i havent a friend
here i heard what was said of me just
now-no father no mother left at a
boarding school the girl from no-
where you called me even mrs let-
terby said i was a stray whom ethel
had picked up and brought into the
house

  the people facing madge carrick in
a wide-flung circle were now growing
restless and whispering together mrs
cartright called limpet to one side and
seemed to remonstrate with him but


the poiiulacr magazine

he shook his head and returned to the
table it was clcai that his fighting
blood was lip and that nothing could
stop him

  miss carrick said he you have
just stated that such and such things
would happen if you disclosed where
the jewel was that proves my conten-
tion  for one cannot disclose what one
docs not know and to hide an object

that has been stolen is as bad-

  hold on limpet exclaimed young
hapwood turning very red dont
you think youve badgered miss carrick
enough i do

  i am mrs cartrights attorney
young man and likewise her friend-
the oldest here perhaps limpet
flashed back at him just whom do
you represent

  i dont represent anybody the lat-
ter retorted hotly squaring his broad
shoulders and throwing up his hand-
some head but until mrs cartright
puts me out therell be no more of this
underhand cross-examination

  an awkward pause followed and
then mrs letterby spoke

  oh madge complained she petu-
lantly do tell mr limpet what he
wants to know im worn out see
i believe its daylight

  sure enough when one of the men-
servants had pulled aside the curtains
dawn entered the room looking doubly
cold and gray against the yellow glow
of the electric lights

   glanced at the windows then back
toward the girl sitting at the table-and
at that instant i saw the ruby

  at first i marveled how the jewel
could have so long escaped detection
with all those eyes gazing apparently
directly at it but then i realized how
cleverly it had been concealed and that
my position in relation to the changed
lighting osf the room had alone made
it visible to me

  at the same instant also i appre-
ciated that madge carrick was right

in the beginning i had thought her at-
titude a foolish one but now i under-
stood that whether guilty or not silence
was the only weapon she had wherewith
to defend herself for if she had stolen
the ruby to betray its whereabouts
would be almost tantamount to a con-
fession of her guilt whereas if she
were innocent the act of disclosure
would merely serve to increase the sus-
picion and hostility already manifest to-
ward herself while it aided the actual
thief to keep his or her identity hidden
there was no escape for her she had
been nailed fast to her place by the
scrutiny of more than twenty pairs of
eyes

  but now i was in a quandary i
alone shared her secret what use
should i make of it i glanced at the
girl pale haggard desperate at the
futile ethel trying to console her at
hapwood flaming but helpless to aid
her and last of all at limpet pre-
paring to take another twist with the
thumbscrews and for good or ill i
set in action a plan which at that mo-
ment flashed into my mind

  mrs cartright said i with a deci-
sion and harshness which were pur-
posely assumed dont you think this
has gone far enough  miss carrick has
had her opportunity and has turned it
down with your permission ill tele-
phone for the police theyll know how
to handle her

  i crossed the room in the midst of a
deathlike silence and took up the tele-
phone instrument but before i could
unhook the receiver i heard a voice-a
feeble shaking voice

  stop it quavered dont tele-
phone  i did it-i did it

  i hugged myself at the quick success
of my plan if-as i had argued-
madge carrick were guilty my threat
would merely end an intolerable situa-
tion if innocent the real thief would
have the horror of her position so
sharply brought home to him that
the gll from nowhere



should but one spark of decency still
burn within him he would inevitably
reveal himself the last had happened
i dropped the telephone and turned to
see who it was who spoke in tones so
full of terror and remorse

  it was the butler

  you cried mrs cartright amazed

  yes madam it was i god help
me

  but why i dont understand you
have been with me for years i always
trusted you

  i know madam but when i heard
the lady and gentleman at table say

- he stopped and flung out his

hands in despair no no forget
that please i shouldnt have said it
i would have bitten out my tongue be-
fore i said it

  the man was beside himself his
long thin face was the color of chalk
and he clung to a chair for support

  do you dare tell me that you were
led to attack and rob me through any
remark made by my guests that is
absurd  it is worse it is a falsehood

  believe me mrs cartright its true
if you will grant me one last favor
before they take me away-if you will
only ask the ladies to step into the
library-i will prove to you that it is
true i will confess everything-every-
thing

  but when all the others had gone
from the room except mrs cartright
limpet hapwood and myself the but-
ler stood there voiceless a forlorn de-
jected figure

  now out with your cock-and-bull
story commanded limpet impatiently
and let us have done with this thing for
good and all

  i will-i will sir the man whis-
pered hoarsely peering anxiously about
him when i heard her say-when i
heard mrs letterby say that now that
she had left school she could not keep
up and mr habersham he said-he

told what often happens-what might

happen to a young girl-

  she had left school of whom
are you talking demanded mrs cart-
right

  of madge carrick madam

  miss madge carrick you mean but
what is she to you 

  she is my daughter mrs cart-
right

  your daughter

  yes and i wanted her to be like
her mother was who died when madge
was a little thing not like me-sunk
sunk in the struggle of life to what i
am you will never believe me but i

was once- never mind its no odds

what i once was the world has been
too much for me-thats all-too much
but for her sake i fought on i have
pinched myself to the bone for her i
hid myself from her i changed my
name that she might have her chance-
that she might not be dragged down
with me i would gladly have died for
her and the thought that after all
i had failedthat now she needed more
than i could possibly give her and the
danger mr habersham spoke of-it
made me crazy mrs cartright the
temptation was too much for me and i
turned out the lights and snatched the
ruby

  he stopped for a moment to wipe
away the beaded sweat on his fore-
head and then went on dejectedly
and now my hopes my foolish
hopes have all come to nothing i am
done for but whatever happens i beg
you mrs cartright i implore all of you
to keep my secret do that much not
for me but for her that is all i ask
-let her have her chance-let her have
her chance

  but the jewel where is it in-
quired limpet

  with a shudder the butler went to
the table and out of a glass of the ruby-
colored wine standing at his daughters
place-where the crossing of the lights


the popular magazine

from lamps and windows had made it
visible to her and to me-he lifted the
gem wiped it patiently upon a napkin
and handed it to his mistress and then
he set about clearing the table quite
automatically the force of year-long
habit surviving even the stunning blow
he had received

 when did you hide it there i
asked him

  the man gazed at me dully when
you turned out the lights sir said he
and i suspected that we would all be
searched i was worse frightened than
ever then suddenly i thought of the
wine and i dropped the ruby into a
full glass which stood before my daugh-
ter i had watched her-had seen that
she drank nothing-and felt sure it
would be safe there until i could take it
out later on

 and it was you who knocked the
maid down 

  accidentally sir the room was
dark she stepped in my way

  do you hear that hapwood

  the young man nodded and left the
room

  thatll do said limpet now
dannart you can call the police

  no declared mrs cartright im-
pulsively this has been enough of
a tragedy already

  what exclaimed limpet youd
let the man off impossible

  mrs cartright flushed and her eyes
gleamed

  remember said she that i was
the person injured and the only one
my heart tells me to forgive but if
i punish it shall be in a way that will
affect this man alone and all of us
who have heard this pitiful story must
do our utmost to forget it whatever
may have happened-to-night or in the
past-the girl shall have her chance
and then her expression changed
she smiled gently and laying one hand
lightly on limpets arm and one on
mine she said but see we need
not trouble ourselves it has already
come to her

  she was right in the hall beyond
stood the girl from nowhere and
helping her into her wrap was young
hapwood on whose handsome face
there shone that look of youth and hope
which laughs at difficulties and conven-
tions-at everything in fact but love

the social farmer

irving bacheller while on a tramping tour through new england dis-
    covered an old fanner sitting on his front porch

     fine corn said mr bacheller tentatively using a hillside filled with
straggling stalks as a means of starting a conversation

     best in the state said the old man

     how do you plow so steep a field asked the author

     dont plow it said the farmer when the spring thaws come the rocks
rolling down the hill tear up the soil so that we can plant corn

    and how do you plant it asked mr bacheller

     the farmer said he didnt plant it really he stood in his back door and
shot the seed in with a shotgun

     is that the truth asked bacheller

     shucks said the farmer disgusted thats conversation
