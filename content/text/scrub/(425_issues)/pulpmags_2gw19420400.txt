foot itch
athletes foot
why take
  the germ that causes the disease is
known as tinea trichophyton it buries
itself deep in the tissues of the skin and
is very hard to kill a test made shows
it takes  minutes of boiling to destroy
the germ whereas upon contact labora-
tory tests show that ii f will kill the
germ tinea trichophyton within 
seconds
  h f was developed solely for the pur-
pose of relieving athletes foot it is a
liquid that penetrates and dries quickly
you just paint the affected parts h f
gently peels the skin which enables it
to get to parasites which exist under the
outer cuticle
itching often relieved
quickly
  as soon as you apply h f you may
find that the itching is relieved you
should paint the infected part with h f
nightly until your feet are better usu-
ally this takes from three to ten days
  h f should leave the skin soft and
smooth you may marvel at the quick
way it brings you relief it costs you
pay nothing till relieved
send coupon
  at least  of the adult population of
the united states are being attacked by the
disease known as athletes foot
  usually the disease starts between the toes
little watery blisters form and the skin
cracks and peels after a while the itching
becomes intense and you feel as though you
would like to scratch off all the skin
beware of it spreading
  often the disease travels all over the bot-
tom of the feet the soles of your feet be-
come red and swollen the skin also cracks
and peels and the itching becomes worse and
worse
  get relief from this disease as quickly as
possible because it is both contagious and in-
fectious and it may go to your hands or even
to the under arm or crotch of the legs
chances
nothing to try so if you are troubled
with athletes foot why wait a day
longer

 uair-trigger hallock
i i stood sidewise at the mahog-

top his back to the wall in the elk-
horn bar he always stood-or sat-
thus facing doors windows people
vivid in his memory was the scene in
jerry lewiss saloon deadwood gulch
when wild bill hickok lay with his
cheek in his own gore because for
once wild bill had exposed his back
to a door the rear-entrance of jerrys
tom hallock had been a gangling kid
then tending bar at rush time sweep-
ing and doing odd jobs most of the time
and the rest which he had to himself
he spent in worshipping the tamer of
abilene and practicing with a six-
shooter he aspired to expert gunman-
ship wild bill his pattern though the
fact was unknown to hickok tom
didnt realize what a career he was aim-
ing at with two sixes when he had

to the batwings past hallocks guns
until the kid saw a matt die from one of his bullets wild bill hickok would remain
his pattern-until his first killing sent him forever on the dodge young tom hallock
would count colt-speed king and choose for his saddlemates only those hellions
who lived by the gun
mastered the handling of one until he
saw a man die from one of his bullets
a center shot and a fair enough killing
according to frontier code that is he
gave his opponent an even break the
dead man had been a half-baked des-
perado and his demise was no loss to
the community nor was that of his
two friends whose toes the trigger-ex-
pert youth turned up when they essayed
an eye for an eye but the triple kill-
ing had sent tom on the dodge regret-
ting his notches rather than glorying in
them he had anticipated a feeling of
elation out-triggering men who lived

two-gun western novels magazine
conscience was a pestiferous thing
but gradually it hardened and the
number of his victims mounted and his
guns became as much a part of him as
his hands now at thirty he found him-
self haunted with faces of the past
some blurred by time but none of them
missing from his mental gallery of
necessity he lived where the law could
not reach or was farcically represented
derringer montana was a hotbed of
desperadoism it had tamed down not
a peg since it appeared on the time-
tables of the northern pacific yet
even in the midst of men as law-shy as
himself hallock must be eternally vigi-
lant for like a champion of whatever
there were plenty who would kill him
for the notoriety it would bring them
there was an if as always-if they
could get the edge and remembering
the lesson taught by the passing of bill
hickok he was ever alert in the pres-
ence of his fellow men with one excep-
tion
  the exception entered the elkhorn
at that moment looking for hallock
hallock who had not been tom for
ten years but hair-trigger a two-
handed gunfighter who had put the
art in artillery and daily cursed the
fame that would not let him act the
normal man
  stranger just got offn the west-
bound an headin this way looks like
he might be a law-dog no hardware
showin thus spoke the exception
otherwise reckless brule in the ear
of hallock
  the northern pacific station was
catty-cornered across the street from
the elkhorn saloon and brule had been
occupying a chair on the stoop of the
latter whenever a train stopped or
the old concord swung in from the back
country passengers who alighted were
accorded careful scrutiny by the gun-
toting tribe of derringer the latest
town marshal had joined his predeces-
sors in boot hill but a week since-
though not by the hand of hallock-
and the minds of derringers denizens
were temporarily warped with unusual
suspicion of unfamiliar faces any time
the sheriff of missoula county might
take it into his head to clean up
either come himself or send a deputy
therefore reckless brule was moved
to warn his pal who had a longer rec-
ord of killings than any derringer gun-
slinger albeit cleaner killings
ctanding together at the bar the
 two presented a strange contrast
hallock taller by two inches than
brule was wide-shouldered lean-
flanked with frosty eyes aquiline nose
and thin lips featuring a smooth-
shaven face the color of redwood he
was crowned by a grey stetson knocked
into a denver poke the loose ends
of the raw hide chin-strap dangling over
the knot of his bandanna wore plain
leather riding-cuffs thong-laced shirt
and fringed leather chaps stood up in
the inevitable cowboy boots crossed
belts supported his ordnance two hol-
stered colts equalizers brule nick-
named reckless by the man he had
thrown in with because reckless of the
hazard linked to the association was
gorilla-like in form and so bow-legged
he appeared to be hairpinning the bar-
rel of a horse even when walking hair
and beard were fiery red and of luxu-
riant growth a battered short-
brimmed stetson tilted over one ear his
forearms were bare his greasy vest
flapped open his trousers worn out-
side his boots were rolled up several
inches above the ankle a grotesque
figure this brule but a cross-arm draw
artist and steel-true to the man he called
pal
  at brules whispered information
hallock nodded and his lips tightened
the gorilla-man oozed away from his
side and took spraddled stand near the
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

door covering his purpose of watching
by digging up a blackened briar and
filling it other bad men were in the
room lesser lights in the triggerfinger
four hundred but only one paid par-
ticular heed to brules trip to the bar
this hombre leaned on the mahogany
ten paces from hallock he was a cow-
puncher gone bad and no halfway
about it the disease known as trigger-
fingeritis had struck into his vitals and
from drifting about tough camps and
avoiding the open his once tanned vis-
age had begotten a pallor which was
the derivative of the name chalk
gallatin chalk fostered the hope of
being pointed out as the gunpacker
who had cut a notch for hair-trigger
hallock
  hair-trigger apparently did not no-
tic when a quiet-looking stranger som-
breroed and booted the one who had
dropped off the northern pacific and
made a bee-line for the elkhorn strode
in and ranged himself suspiciously near
the gunfighter hallocks eyes nar-
rowed the newcomer nominated his
pizen and when the bartender turned
to the back-bar shot a glance to the
left in which direction stood chalk
gallatin presenting his profile clink-
ing of bottle and glass as they slid
across the bar drew the strangers gaze
to the front again the rotgut he
poured between bearded lips made him
shiver as he set down the glass he
looked to the right realizing hallock
was staring hard at him before the
stranger could wink hair-trigger had
conjured a blue-barreled gun against
his ribs
  yuh lookin for anybody mister
bluntly inquired hallock
  no replied the other visibly rat-
tled and instantly raising hands shoul-
der-high but he added after the
briefest pause fascinated eyes on the
muzzling gun id part with fifty
bucks to know where the shootin-iron
come from
  the tricks priceless replied hal-
lock grimly if i sold it to yuh i might
go to boot hill soonern i aim to
stranger ill hafta disbelieve youre
not out gunnin till ive pawed yuh
over hallock took no mans word
but brules and still holding the drop
frisked the strangers person seeking
a weapon-and a badge in search of
the latter he turned back the lapels of
the mans coat pulled open outing shirt
and undershirt
  button up hair-trigger grunted
finally and holstering his six-shooter
stepped back drink on me pilgrim
to show theres no hard feelins
  i can see im off my range consid-
erable said the pilgrim hardly re-
assured by the company he was in
i wont linger after ive drank to yuhr
health-an hired a hoss i meant to
ask where i could get one ridin to
look over the two bar ranch
i tallock mentioned a livery-stable
	 on main street the stranger
looked at the two-gun man over the
rim of his glass then wheeled to de-
part throwing a second glance at chalk
gallatin whose face was still averted
halfway across the saloon floor the
prospective ranch-buyer was halted by
the vibrant voice of hallock and turned
nervously
  a word of advice pilgrim take it
or leave it droned hair-trigger git
heeled if yuh figger to reach the two
bar healthy shes not a peaceful trail
out thataway
  thanks just as much returned the
other forcing a faint smile but im
slow on the pull an i reckon i wont
invite attack if its apparent im not
packing iron will show ive got nothin
worth defendin for instance yuh
wouldnt believed i wasnt on the shoot
if yuhd found a gun on me tell yuh
friend those who live by the trigger-
	two-gun western novels magazine
but i wouldnt want yuh should get
mad at me so i wont say no more
a fool has got to go his pace an
find declared hallock then under his
breath as the stranger exited talks
like a preacher not a rancher
  but hair-trigger was uncomfortably
impressed to date the only law that
he recognized was that which rests in
a holster he lounged over to reckless
brule who with his head out the door
was watching to see that the stranger
laid a course for the livery stable
  what yuh think o his sentiments
reckless inquired hallock who val-
ued the gorilla-mans opinion
  huh brule drew in his head and
turned on hair-trigger jerking up his
flaming beard with a one-sided facial
twist betokening disgust hell too
pure for this world a bebbe will hold
him up some day-an buzzards pick
his bones taint tame enough for the
golding roole this montanny he
snorted letting his beard fall
  neither saw the sneer on the face of
chalk gallatin bad cowpuncher
who was hoping the man bound for the
two bar had a defective memory for
faces
  i dunno reckless if yuhre right
or not-an its the first time said
hair-trigger and retired to his corner
at the end of the bar
  the redhead gazed after him so
muddled and amazed that he opened
his jaws and his pipe dropped no
savvy he grunted and recovering his
pipe went out and flopped in the chair
on the stoop
  chalk gallatin swaggered very short-
ly from the elkhorn and paused by
brules chair to ask sotto voce hair-
trigger talked kinda queer didnt he
losin his nerve yuh reckon ive heard
tell gun-fighters do some-
  looket here brules eyes blazed
up into the pale face of the ex-cow-
boy yuh be damn shore hes lost it
yuh dehorned spawn of a maverick
afore yuh stand up to him he knows
yuhre stalkin him that yuhd like the
glory o posin as his killer but dont
make no fatal mistake hes got a
mood on like he gits sometimes but
his triggerfingers iled yuh betche
  the twist of chalks lips was a fail-
ure as a smile he lifted his head at
the clipclop of hoofs saw the stranger
off the northern pacific riding down
the street from the direction of the
livery stable and promptly turned his
back until the other had gone by brule
glanced at chalk from under his shaggy
red brows he made a mental note to
tell hallock of the incident
  there goes a shorthorn whats due
to impede a forty-five slug afore hes
many weeks older brule made a bet
with himself as chalk left the stoop
and rolled up street scarcely did he
realize how far-sighted he was-and
at the same time short-sighted
chapter ii
he kills his pal
deckless brule thought he
would go to bed he sat on the
edge of his bunk in the shack he occu-
pied with hallock several doors above
the elkhorn bar and listened to a
harangue on laziness from the tall gun-
man standing in front of him
  which yuhve done nothin but hold
down a chair on the elkhorn stoop all
day reckless declared hallock hook-
ing thumbs in his belts cash is gettin
low an we need ammunition for our
stummicks if not our guns-
  wal said brule with a grin why
dontcha go out an shoot somebody

hop along an clean em with the help
o god an a few brains he had his
vest off and his flannel shirt began to
pull at his boots

for revenge hallock blew out the lamp
on the table yuhll be jealous when
yuh see my pockets bulgin tomorrer
mornin fireface an yuhll be hongry
but i wont-yeh mebbe ill start yuh
to breakfast reckless yuhr too slow
to grow fast  hair-trigger was chuck-
ling his nearest approach to a laugh
as he opened the shack door a hearty
so-long an luck followed him from
the darkness as he shut the door
  an hour from the time he bought
chips in the draw session at the elk-
horn with the five train robbers hal-
lock arose cleaned to his last dollar
another man took his place and the
crestfallen gun-fighter swallowed two
fingers of whisky at the bar now pre-
sided over by the owner himself sam
brace and walked out as he emerged
on the stoop the dim moving outline
of a man almost abreast of the hitch-
rack drove all thought of his flat
state from his mind coming from the
lamp glare of the elkhorn into the
comparative darkness of the starlit out-
doors hallock did not recognize the
figure a word from either would have
prevented tragedy but neither spoke it
the man in the street forgetting that
hallocks sight could trick him in the
circumstances hallock saw the mans
hand drop toward his waistline one
of the notoriety-seekers possibly chalk
gallatin who had not been in the saloon
that evening flashed through the gun-
fighters brain and he acted simultane-
ous with the thought throwing his
right-hand gun with deadly accuracy
the figure sank soundlessly
  he smoking tube in his hand hal-
	lock leaped off the stoop and warily
approached the heap on the ground
hardly expecting it to move for he
knew about where the bullet had hit
but cautious none the less eyes by
now more accustomed to the semi-dark
he stooped a wild curse escaped his
lips cold sweat oozed from every pore
-the still face turned up to the stars
was that of his one and only friend
reckless brule a hole drilled almost
in the center of his forehead horror
and revulsion gnawing at his heart for
the first time in his life and realizing
that nothing could be done that death
was instantaneous hallock happened
to glance at one out-flung arm of his
dead pal and discovered clutched in
the fingers a handkerchief
  was pullin his bandanna-an i
reckoned he was mebbe gallatin aim-
in to fan a gun on me  exclaimed hal-
lock stricken deeper goddelmighty
he mustve changed his mind about
sleepin an was cornin to help me
clean the train robbers if hed only
spoke-or i hadnt been so damned
quick old hand lifting the head
of brule to his knee believe me i
didnt know it was yuh i wish i was in
yuhr boots this minit
  he pressed the head to his chest and
rocked on his heels in silent agony then
he lifted to his feet heaved the heavy
lifeless body across his shoulder and
carried it up the stoop and into the
well-lighted elkhorn sam brace and

two-gun western novels magazine
several loungers who had drifted to-
ward the door as the shot boomed out
drew back as hallock entered with his
burden the card players had given
no attention to the shot because gun-
play was such a common occurrence in
derringer as a rule no citizen moved
any faster when one or more guns tuned
up in main street unless he chanced to
be in the line of fire it was a gun-
toting town however the entrance of
hair-trigger hallock muttering like a
wild man drew even the gaze of the
poker-playing train robbers and the
groups at two other card tables hal-
lock eased the body of reckless upon
the bar-top directly in the rays of a
lamp and tossing his hat on the floor
as if its weight oppressed him faced
the incredulous staring groups of men
the card games were suspended he
was the focus of all eyes
  that shot yuh heard killed reckless
-i killed my pal hallock shouted
beside himself with grief
  the slow-draw pilgrim which oozed
in here to-day shy artillery was right
-im the fool that had to go his pace
an find if i wasnt always packin
guns an bein so free with em trouble
wouldnt be alia time campin on my
trail makin me watch sharp day an
night-i wouldnt have shot so quick
an sayin nothin mistakin reckless
in the dark for someun lookin to cut a
notch for me reachin for his hanker
he held up the bandanna an i thought
it was a gun he was after chalk galla-
tin i figgered it might be-hes been
honin for my hair he paused to
draw breath his eyes roving from face
to face as if seeking relief his hands
clenching and opening truly displaying
more emotion than anyone would have
imagined was in him he had been
looked upon always as a ruthless silent
nerveless man-killing machine to
hell with hardware an gun-slingin
he cried suddenly im done and
with frenzied haste unbuckled his gun
belts and piled them on the bar beside
brules remains
  instantly to an accompanying hiss
of intaken breaths as his several ene-
mies present realized the lion had shorn
himself of teeth and claws hands darted
to gun-grips hallock self-disarmed and
likely to pay the penalty for an un-
guarded moment did not cringe in-
stead contempt and anger boiled up in
him evident in the blaze of his eyes the
puffing of his lips he shook a hard fist
  damn yuh for yellow-spined skulk-
ers he roared you wouldnt dast
make that handplay if i was packin
iron
hthey hesitated all but one with fin-
a gers resting on walnut butts that
one blackfoot dixon quarter-breed
side-kick of chalk gallatin had half
drawn the colt from his holster but
an invisible hand seemed to prevent
him getting it clear of the leather his
gun arm was rigid
  yuh blackfoot yuh aimin to
cheat yuhr pal chalk o the glory o
salivatin me why dontcha draw
injun hallocks tone should have
precipitated action on the quarter-
breeds part but it didnt and he was
not alone in his frozen state hallock
dominated them as much without his
guns as with them one man display-
ing a proper fearlessness may out-face
several more easily than he can a single
opponent
  hallock continued on a contemptu-
ous note as furtive glances were ex-
changed among the hesitant bidders
for fame he was a man to tie to was
reckless-of yuh all he was the only
one would risk stickin by me an to
think i give him his ticket its a
curse on me for the bloody record ive
been settin up thats what it is an
i hate to let reckless go on in the dark
alone hed never let me take any trail
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

lonesome-always to hand joggin at my
elbow ready to back me in whatever
go ahead-shoot somebody yuhll be
savin me a hull lot o hell on earth if
im with reckless i wont mind so
much for i can tell him i made a damn
fool mistake
  hallock surveyed them one after an-
other with a taunting expression wait-
ing for the shots he would welcome to
come but they did not he was to
be denied even the solace of forgetful
death
  every tail curled he pronounced
acidly not a thoroughbred among
yuh with the guts to send me along o
reckless
  heres your chance to join reck-
less yuh dont have to ask me twice
chalk gallatin stepped from the outer
darkness into the saloon with the utter-
ance his six-shooter lined from the hip
it threw a long tongue of flame with a
cannon-like noise as hallock turned
toward the door the gunfighter stared
with filming eyes at the evil leering face
of chalk did not look at the smoking
gun at all no sound passed his set lips
as his knees gave way a moment he
supported himself on outflung hands
battling with the lead in his system
then with a sigh stretched out on the
floor
  well he asked for it didnt he
chalk snarled at the stony-faced men
annoyed at their silence when he had
expected vociferous applause
  yeh he asked for it nodded black-
foot dixon and he was the only one
who spoke
  others had paralyzed bazoos black-
foot observed chalk and with swag-
ger more pronounced than ever ap-
proached the bad he laid a hand on
hallocks discarded forty-fives and
belts bein im the only man had
nerve enough to cash him boasted
chalk half-turning toward the men i
reckon i win the right to wear his
flame-throwers-
  take your hands off those guns
a girls voice issued the command
chalk gallatin more startled than if
a man had spoken jerked his head the
other way none had noticed the en-
trance by the door to a back room of
sam braces daughter sue almost
twenty she was the amazon type not
much under six feet splendidly pro-
portioned her dark hair which she
could sit upon when unconfined was
parted in the middle and in thick plaits
coiled around her head features irreg-
ular and handsome rather than beauti-
ful looks and build were her moth-
ers a pioneer woman for her father
was stocky but broad-shouldered she
had the courage of both and was bal-
ancing sams sawed-off as expertly
as any man in the bar-room
  chalk wilted at sight of her and not
only because of the shot-gun trained on
his heart if he was capable of loving
anyone besides himself that other was
sue brace
  sue said chalk yuh tells me to
hands off an i obeys but nobody
only yuh-
  anybody with a grain of sand in his
craw could back you down chalk gal-
latin interrupted the girl scornfully
you can shoot from behind and from
cover and your talk is bigger than a
dozen men but its just noise-thats
the size of you think of you facing
hallock if hed had a gun-
  that moment hair-trigger stirred
slightly and groaned
halks hand flew to his pistol-
-holster not dead  he exclaimed
stepping back and looking down at the
gunfighter
  sue brace breathed something which
sounded very much like thank god
then lifted the shotgun for a fuller bead
on the hell-bent puncher just you
dare to draw she whipped forth
	two-gun western novels magazine
take a chance with this shotgun if
you dare 
  chalks lips curled back he had
flushed through his white skin at her
scathing arraignment now the pallor
returned intensified not fear-though
he knew she would execute her threat
if he did not take heed-but white fury
born of jealousy her defence of the
helpless two-gun man would have been
evidence enough to stake the fires of
that poisonous emotion without chalk
hearing in addition what she said un-
der her breath the expression of his
eyes was abysmal it looked for a mo-
ment as if in spite of the twin barrels
chalk would draw and extinguish that
remaining spark in hallock but the
ex-cowboys passion did not overmaster
him to the point of recklessness he
loved his entirely worthless life first of
all and relinquished his gun-grip dis-
trustful of him even then sue brace
maintained her drop and called to her
father who had viewed her interference
with a proud parental eye
  pa you heard hallock maybe
doc bennison can do something for
him take him up to my room while
 keep this glory-hunter lined
  no sooner said than done sister
sam brace moved quickly suiting ac-
tion to his words hallock was a dead
weight and no slight one but the sturdy
saloonkeeper managed to shift him on
his back and with the daughter cover-
ing his retreat staggered to the stair-
way at one end of the barroom when
sam had passed up out of sight sue
placed the sawed-off on the bar
  to show you chalk gallatin she
said that im not afraid for myself
only afraid you might finish the cow-
ards job you started before  could
daylight you
  yuhd shoot me-to save hallock
gallatins rage-inflamed eyes burned
into hers
  in a minute  she replied in a tone
that admitted of no possible doubt her
chin high if id had that gun handy
when you stepped through the door
youd never have unhooked a shot at
hallock hallocks shouting brought
me out of the back room and while i
was listening you- dont you feel low-
down chalk gallatin
  yuh-yuh sputtered chalk ad-
vancing on her a step like that hal-
lock
  like i love him sue amended
unblushingly
  chalk had nothing to say the dec-
laration had the effect of a gun-barrel
smashing him between the eyes he
shot the girl one sinister look then
jingled to the bar and poured himself
a drink and drink after drink
  sam brace came down the stairs and
over to sues side
  hearts beatin faint-but mighty
faint he informed in a whisper that
was loud enough for every ear in the
silent barroom to catch
  you get doc bennison pa di-
rected sue and ill go and stay with
hallock she gathered up hair-trig-
gers heavy belts with the dangling hol-
sters
  supposin docs jiggered hesitated
sam and added he bought a quart o
scotch s mornin
  you try him pa if you cant bring
him i will the amazon started for
the stairs clasping hallocks artillery
to her breast
  sam wheeled and vanished through
the front door chuckling that daugh-
ter of his was a royal straight flush-
you met one of her kind in a lifetime
  all belly up commanded chalk
gallatin who had not lifted his gaze
from the bar while sue remained in
the room
cnsued a concerted movement to-
   ward the mahogany the bottle slid
from hand to hand no word was spo-
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

ken ten minutes went by and in
came sam brace followed by a big
unkempt red-faced man in rusty
clothes doc bennison whose medi-
cal and surgical skill was only equaled
by his appetite for whisky he would
have been celebrated had he not sold
john barleycorn his rights to a name
just now he was in an unusual state-
sober
  upstairs doc-first room to the
right sues said sam going around
behind the bar if yuh boys has killed
off that quart by this time addressing
the bar flies ill just collect the price
from yuh chalk
  and chalk thrust a bill at him with-
out a murmur sams shotgun lay
handy the saloonkeeper made change
saw chalk pocket it then watched
through lowered lids while gallatin
fished a horn-handled clasp knife from
another pocket opened the blade and
drawing his six-shooter deliberately
cut a deep nick in the walnut grip of
the gun
  bennison was upstairs more than an
hour and all that time chalk gallatin
hung against the bar neither drinking
nor talking just so much liquor si-
lenced him made him to a degree dan-
gerous despite his yellow streak the
others including blackfoot dixon
played cards half-heartedly at two
tables they were waiting chalk was
waiting finally came the slovenly
doctor carrying his worn medicine-
case he got abreast of chalk and the
cowboy put forth an arresting hand
and broke his silence
  will he live doc
  bennisons whisky-red face deep-
ened in its ruddy hue i think so
certainly husky maverick i got the
bullet out glanced off a rib smashed
the rib but it saved his life dont
mean to tell me you did it
  its better yuh let him die doc
was the way gallatin answered his
sullen eyes full of menace i dont
want to carve off the notch i just cut
for him
  open one of your veins and it would
spurt yellow chalk gallatin sneered
the undaunted bennison and brushing
off the detaining hand and nodding to
sam brace back of the bar he slouched
out
chapter iii
romance shoots center
f he first words to issue from
hair-trigger hallocks lips when
he regained speech concerned
the lamented reckless brule
  my pal-whatd yuh do with him
sue brace moving about the room
and tidying up unaware of his return
to consciousness until he spoke turned
with a smile that was as cheering as
morning sunlight
  well if im not glad to hear that
voice-and so strong lie still now
trigger pa buried reckless back of
your shack dont feel badly about it
-i mean more than you can help
youve been in a bad way yourself
this is the second day since chalk
gallatin shot you she stressed the
cowboys name scornfully
  yeh the yellow dog hallock
nodded slowly too weak to be very
emphatic anybody else shootin even
blackfoot dixon i wouldnt have
minded so much fact is i honed to
have em ventilate me just then-an
even now-pore reckless  he looked
away from sue who had seated herself
at the foot of the bed
  but you didnt mean to do it it
was a sorry accident and guess as much
brules fault as yours i heard you tell
about it that night she did not al-
lude to her part in the violent drama

two-gun western novels magazine
nor of course to her confession before
the elkhorns patrons
  im goin to live am i spite o
chalks bullet his question was
fraught with no especial interest he
was blind to the warmth in sues fine
eyes now as he had been blind all along
preoccupied with his notches and the
first law of nature to the exclusion
almost of all else
  doc bennison says youll be fine
as split silk just as good as ever he
removed the bullet but dont talk
any more now trigger sleep if you
can rest anyway
  all right though i wouldnt have a
kick cornin if i cashed livin without
reckless my onliest friend will be hell
an thinkin-
  think of this sue put in that
he was one friend but not the only
one
  hallock pondered the statement
gazing at her queerly this yuhr
room he asked suddenly
  yes and ill be with you as long-
as you need me
  gimme a drink o water please
he requested confused an ill try an
corral some o that sleep yuh recom-
mended
  his wound healed his strength came
back rapidly sam brace dropped in
on him two or three times a day and
smoked a pipe while hallock rolled his
own
  say sam said the gunfighter
propped up on pillows one afternoon
a week from the time he began to con-
valesce im runnin up some bills
with yuh an the doc an i dunno how
im goin to pay em im done with
gun-slingin thats one shore thing an
its the only business i ever follered
how to make some honest coin is pes-
terin-
  yuh let me an doc worry about

an if yuh mention bills agin ill
knock your block off beins yuhre
helpless if i cant do my future son-
in-law a turn when hes needin it-
  son-in-law hair-trigger almost
yelled sitting straight up
  here dont yuh get to buckin an
open that there wound agin remon-
strated the elkhorns owner i says
son-in-law an yuh goes into the air
like yuhd set on prickly pears whats
the matter dont yuh want sue-or
what is it he was a trifle huffed
  why shore i want-but great guns
i never reckoned- then hallock
sank back and was briefly silent i
know now why she looks at me so-so
funny sometimes
  funny huh so thats the way it
struck yuh sam chuckled his anger
fled trigger i know yuhre a dinger
in a fight but suspicion yuhre a pore
lover-huh
  uh-huh but sam i never tangled
much with women
  tangled with one now all right
yuh been nursed by sue moren a week
an didnt wise up to the fact hard
to believe knowin yuhve been con-
scious
  cant blame it all on my dumbness
sam how was i to know a girl as fine
as yuhr sue would take up with a low-
flung killer like i am-or was
  well mebbe yuh are excusable on
them grounds but its plumb fact
yuh shouldve heard her tell that gal-
latin right before blackfoot an the
rest the night yuh kil-was gunned
yessir to their faces an straight from
the shoulder
  whatd she say
sam relighted his pipe before answer-
ing yuh ask her trigger it
was shore plain enough an set chalk
most crazy hes been hangin round
her yuh savvy but couldnt pint in
anywheres seems yuh aint knowin
nothin about what happened that night
when a texas town goes gun-crazy
j
after chalk plugged yuh itll be in-
terestin tellin and he related all the
facts
  i feel different tonight sue re-
marked the gunfighter that evening
when his nurse brought supper on a
large tray
  different worse she set the
tray on a chair beside his bed and
scanned him with anxious eyes
  nom that is nothins worse but
my heart that is right bad
  she was instantly relieved by his
quizzical expression and at the same
time his words quickened the beat of
her pulse it had been so like a game
of blind-harry trying to show this iron-
and-granite man she cared and to what
extent she cared but the bandage
seemed to have slipped off she came
slowly closer lips parted
  hallock was sitting up he reached
for and captured her hand drew her
down beside him on the bed
  sue he said eye to eye with her
forgive me for makin it so hard for
yuh but what could yuh expect of a
man whose mind was twisted with
thinkin murder allatime-professional
gunfightin is just that even when yuh
give yuhr marked man a show like i
always done i wasnt driven into my
first gunnin like some-i did it delib-
erate because i was crazy about guns
an honed to imitate wild bill hickok
who used to hang in a saloon where i
worked down at deadwood had nat-
ural ability i reckon an improved it
with practice my first killin didnt
make me feel like i thought it would
high-chinned-but id made a begin-
nin an had to go on an with the
tough rep ive got now i couldnt figger
that a girl like yuh- but its the
truth his grip on her hand tightened
yuhre the first girl i ever looked at
twice seein yuh when i first hit this
town i said to myself shes the woman
i mightve loved but she aint for me
with my blood-stained hands 
  you said that sues face dropped
closer listen trigger-
  toms my name he inserted
though nobodys called me by it for
a long time
  tom i want to say that i hate
bloodshed as much as the next woman
and killing for hire is one of the mean-
est professions on the frontier-mur-
der just as you said but a certain
amount of killing not for money has
been necessary to tame this west and
i realize it and am not squeamish
now that sounds strange perhaps
coming from a woman but my mother
crossed the plains in a covered wagon
which was twice attacked by indians
my father ran a saloon in nevada min-
ing camps before he came here and in
his younger days was reckoned handy
with a shooter your blood-stained
hands tom i dont approve of but-
i just dont see them 
  he marveled speechless
  if id half-guessed id spoken
sooner sue he said at last leaning
toward her which brought their faces
very close together but what had-
what have i to offer yuh except a name
for quick-gunnin-
  is that all tom she smiled with
provocative eyes provocative lips
  no he tensed not all i love
yuh sue
tjis kiss burned and lingered on her
	 firm full mouth and she gave
back with a passionateness that made
him heady she struggled for release
to get her breath his sinewy arms
fell lax and he remarked
  im no great shakes of a lover sue
but i reckon yuh know i mean it
you dont realize your ferocity
mister man she laughed i did once
doubt i thought you could be nothing
but a cold-blooded killing-machine
you seemed to shun me you never more
	two-gun western novels magazine
than passed the time of day with me
i thought you were too blind too cal-
lous ever to see that i loved you-or
that you didnt care and i couldnt
throw myself straight at your head
doubt gone he asked still struck
with the wonder of woman
  entirely when i spoke the other
day of brule having been one friend
but not the only one what held you
back tom didnt you understand
thought i did but wasnt shore
couldnt believe it just couldnt
hardly can now wonderful sue i
wanted to die last week hopin to catch
up with reckless on the long trail
an tell him i didnt do it a-purpose
now i want to live-what man
wouldnt knowin yuh loved him
  she beamed happily then sobered
i know you loved reckless man and
man it was a sad mistake she sym-
pathized
  it cured me o gunfightin he
vowed he turned half-around and
pointed to the cartridge-belts and hol-
stered guns hanging on the bedpost
above him yuh can take those irons
an junk em sue ill never put em
on agin never
  her gaze followed his pointing finger
and for several moments she was silent
the pause surprised him
  dontcha want me to quit- he
asked
  certainly she interrupted hastily
you must start all over put your past
behind and live it down but listen
tom while youre in this town you
are practically surrounded by enemies
not the least of them-though he is a
coward-chalk gallatin hes jealous
of your reputation hed do any under-
handed thing to be able to swagger and
pose as the man who killed you and
not only that he has made advances
to me honorable enough but ive al-
ways repulsed him detested him he
knows that i love you for i told him-
hallock did not mention that her father
had informed him previously-and it
gives him two reasons for jealousy two
killing reasons hes that kind you
know it as well as i do
  hallock nodded and caressed his
stubbly chin thoughtfully yuh think
as long as i stay in derringer i got to
pack my guns or hell down me
  i know it leave as soon as you
can-i dont mean run away-and i
will go with you anytime anywhere
could reckless brule have said more
he couldnt it sounds like reck-
less the gunfighter caught up one
strong white hand and pressed it to his
lips
  and tom said sue earnestly
dont forget that gallatin isnt your
only enemy hes the worst perhaps
but blackfoot dixon is another and
coldiron mcclintock-oh there must
be a dozen
  more than that fellers that dont
come into the elkhorn an i aint over-
lookin one of em replied hallock
grimly an yuhre plumb correct
sue-i got to tote iron much as im
hatin to till weve shook the dust o
derringer i wouldnt let myself get
laid low for nothin now girl cant
hardly believe my luck droppin my
rope on yuh
  she tossed her head you can be-
lieve a fact mister man her eyes
fell on the tray theres your supper
getting cold let me go now draw-
ing away her hand and feed up
  she placed the tray across his knees
in the act of lifting a cup of coffee
he paused and set it down again un-
tasted
  sue he said yuh wont mind if i
ask yuh somethin
  no indeed what is it she won-
dered his manner was so different
 why where at he proceeded
slowly did yuh learn to sling language
the way yuh do yuhre eddicated
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

yuh dont talk none like other frontier
girls leastways the ones ive seen
oh she laughed mother had
schooling and she taught me some
then i went to a little log schoolhouse
in nevada theres no great mystery
about that-why
  hallock swung his head from side to
side me a gun-throwin hellion no
good whatever to nobody no looks no
money never been inside a schoolhouse
-an the likes o yuh takes to me
thats the mystery girl but he
added quickly i aint goin to pry
into it none
chapter iv
womans skirts between
two days later hallock was out
- of bed and able to walk within
the confiines of sues room when
he tired of pacing up and down he
would sit near the open window well
back from it so that he could not be
seen by anyone in the street yet could
himself see from a certain angle it
was by advice of sue brace that he took
this precaution she argued the prud-
ence of not letting his enemies know he
was on his feet again until his strength
had fully returned and his wound en-
tirely healed and hallock readily
acted upon this advice seeing that it
was good the lips of sam brace and
sue and doc bennison the only three
who saw him were sealed regarding
his progress toward recovery
  that night despite his caution dur-
ing the day hallock was guilty of such
negligence as nearly cost him his life
after all when dusk descended on
derringer he pulled down the window-
shade and lighted the gas he had
eaten but was reluctant to go back to
bed his old vitality had reasserted it-
self and he was doing nothing to use
up the excess of energy therefore he
glared at the bed which had befriended
him in time of need and fell to walking
from wall to wall incidentally passing
so close to the window that his shadow
was thrown upon the shade this fact
he absent-mindedly overlooked he
had drawn the shade for the purpose of
cheating hostile eyes in main street
but could not have exposed himself
more dangerously had he left it rolled
up his mind was traveling most plea-
sant paths all revolving about sue
brace when a colt banged in the street
and ripping through the shade a forty-
five slug burned across his forehead
and smashed into the thin wall opposite
the window
  hallock sprang backward startled
dashing the sudden outpouring of blood
from his eyes his wits collected in an
instant he leaped toward the gas-jet
and snapped off the light then spring-
ing by the window spurred to haste by
the thought that another bullet might
be launched upon the heels of the first
he slid a gun from one of the scabbards
on the bed-post the familiar feel of
the gun-grip caused his blood to surge
with the old fighting lust notwith-
standing his renouncement of gunplay
he could not conquer in a moment an
instinct he had catered to fostered to
perfection for years sliding back to
the window he dropped to his knees
and lifted one side of the shade care-
fully his view was much restricted
seeing none on the visible section of
sidewalk opposite-the height at which
the bullet had passed through the shade
had told him at a glance from whence
it came-hallock crawled around to
the other side and repeated the cir-
cumspect performance of peeping but
not the sign of a human being could he
see to train his gun on
  scared he muttered figgered
hed missed when the light went out so
	two-gun western novels magazine
sudden near fooled myself to death
that time forgot about my shadder
he turned at the swift opening of the
door to his darkened room it was
sue a light in the hall revealed mak-
ing out his form crouched down by the
window she imagined with a cold thrill
of horror that the shot from the street
had accomplished its treacherous pur-
pose
  my god she exclaimed for once
in her life on the verge of fainting
  oh i aint hurt none sue hal-
locks voice revived her sinking senses
that is he amended laughing as he
got up and crossed to the unsteady
figure i got my eyebrows singed an
was lucky at that why yuhre tremb-
lin sue one arm was around her
 taint like yuh girl to bust up over
a lit thing like that
  but-but she stammered pretty
close to tears from the reaction i
thought they had got you
  born to be a bridegroom yet he
reassured her and kissed her cool
cheek she noticed a suspicious mois-
ture on her face from contact with his
  you said your eyebrows were
singed that one of your jokes tom
let me see them come over here un-
der the light away from that window
how did they come to see you you
know i warned-
  yes yes but i slipped up he
told her how while following her to the
dther side of the room
yhen by gaslight she saw his en-
saguined visage sue was stricken
again with apprehension but when
she had brought a basin of water and
washed away the blood found to her
relief that a strip of courtplaster would
answer as a bandage
  yuh got any idea sue who the
shootin galoot was hair-trigger
asked while she was applying the
court-plaster i make a guess it was
chalk but wouldnt bet high on it
there bein others like him
  it wasnt chalk he was at the bar
when the shot was fired she replied
i ran out of the back room when i
heard it and there he was just pouring
himself a drink so that lets him out
but blackfoot dixon wasnt there nor
coldiron mcclintock - take your
choice
  an i could guess len roper an a
few more names mebbe before i hit
it
  pa must have thought your window
was the target for he was over by the
front door he called as i came in i
dont see anyone better go upstairs
i was already heading that way heres
pa now
  pa she half-turned as sam brace
admitted himself this man of mine
nearly scared the wits out of me but
hes all right barring a scratch sam
chuckled as he came forward bet
trigger aint never been so babied be-
fore in his life how about it trigger
  i like it doggone it hallock
swiftly defended his nurse and him-
self sam yuhd enjoy gettin hurt
if yuh was younger an somebody like
sue-
  shore id enjoy it dont blame
yuh a-tall sam looked at his punc-
tured window-shade and the identity of
the would-be slayer was discussed
  dont make no difference who
said hallock to end the discussion
he plumb failed but it shows how
careful i gotta be as sue said shore
is a pack o wolves in this camp-an
i was as curly as any up to a few days
ago
  but his enemies were not content
with failure it seemed to hallock that
his eyes had barely closed that night
when voices penetrated his dreamless
sleep he sat up the voices-sues
and chalks-were in the narrow hall-
way right outside his door sue was
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

saying i can get you through the
heart first pull chalk and i will if you
move another step and gallatin
replied believe yuh could an would
dammit
  hair-triggers battle spirit soared
he flung out of bed pulled on shirt and
trousers and reached up in the dark
for his guns the belts and holsters
were hanging in place but the latter
were empty so sans hardware or
weapon of any sort hallock
barefooted over to the door and
swung it wide suddenly the low-
burning gas-jet threw light upon a most
significant tableau there were four
figures one opposing the other three
and all of them poised tensely sue
stood nearest the door presenting her
back to hallock she gripped his miss-
ing six-guns in rock-steady hands
covering the precious trio halfway down
the hall chalk gallatin foremost
blackfoot dixon and coldiron mcclin-
tock flanking him chalks right hand
grasped his belt near his holster and
the fingers twitched nervously with re-
pressed eagerness to complete the move
to draw as hair-trigger stepped out
of his room coldiron mcclintock a
six-foot angular villian and no second-
rate artillerist huskily exclaimed
there he is
t tallqck was in plain view of the
	 men but sue had to depend on
sense of hearing the merest side-
glance would give chalk and pals their
chance this in fact was the critical
moment for chalk sharp-spurred by
twofold jealous hatred of the man who
loomed grimly just beyond went so far
as to unclasp fingers from his belt and
fasten them on his colt-butt the
wooden grip still boasted the notch he
had carved for hallock and resolved
that it should never be removed know-
ing hallock would out-trigger him in
straight-up fight if allowed to fully re-
cover chalk had slipped upstairs with
his two closest companions while sam
brace was in the back room his office
the telltale shadow on the shade had
warned gallatin when informed of it
by the author of the close shot black-
foot dixon that hallock was getting
dangerously well would soon be his old
self and now or never was the time to
act but though the men had negotiated
the stair-fiight undetected they had not
reckoned on sue brace she came out
of the convalescents room just as the
three desperados reached the top of the
stairs and needing no more than a
sight of them to grasp their design she
flew back into the room and out again
lugging hallocks guns
  chalk said sue when gallatin
changed the position of his hand im
watching and i cant miss your so-
called heart at this range not talking
to hear myself either
  dixon on a sharper note catch-
ing the quarter-breed inching behind
gallatin to conceal his purpose of stak-
ing the issue on a quick grab for his
holster stand away from chalk you
cant put over any indian slickness on
me
  sue broke in hallock at her back
pass me the guns an ill fog em to a
finish
  tom she replied evenly youll
oblige me by going back in your room
im a corking good shot and they all
know it theyre going to about-face
and head downstairs again clear this
hall by the count of three or they wont
be able to go down at all
  and she stubbornly refused to give
up the shooting-irons though hallock
all but bent his knees to her at the
same time he thrilled over her grit and
deft handling of the situation
  one counted sue and chalk
visibly started he perceived that she
was going to be as good as her word
  hidin behind a womans skirts

                                                                                 i
taunted chalk glaring past sue at hal-
lock and taking malignant delight in
the red rage that distorted the gun-
fighters features instantly
  if yuh live long enough yuhll
swallow that lie gallatin rasped
hair-trigger taking a step forward one
side of sue
  sue wont yuh please as yuh love
me gimme them guns
  but she shook her head and counted
an ominous two and chalk turned
  dixon and mcclintock had started
sooner desiring no more than gallatin
himself to brave the fire of sues bor-
rowed artillery in the narrow hallway
and as three was uttered the des-
peradoes spurs clinking were descend-
ing the stairs
chapter v
hallock lifts trail
ttll thank yuh to send for doc
bennison sue remarked hair-
trigger next morning after
breakfast
  something the matter she asked
though hardly believing there could be
he looked like the hallock of the days
before reckless brules passing
  nom feelin fine i want to ask
him somethin he paused and when
he spoke again it was deliberately as
if he were carefully choosing his words
dont mind it sue if i-well id like
to see him alone
  although she shook her head and
feigned indifference she was a little
hurt that he should want to keep any-
thing from her but she saw to it that
bennison was summoned
  doc said hallock when the booze-
fighting physician had lurched into one
of the two chairs in the room how
soon can i fight
  bennison arched his eyebrows then
smiled with one side of his face un-
usual question hallock youre com-
ing around fine best specimen ive
ever treated soon why
  i cant let a girl go on protectin
me rejoined hair-trigger enigmati-
cally chalks taunt rankled deep he
perceived the doctor was in the dark
and explained thats twice shes
stood chalk off-cant let it happen
agin
  the doctor nodded know how
you feel hallock but its childish for
anybody to accuse you of skulking back
of a woman and he added bluntly
childish for you to let it rile you
hallock started to snort then abrupt-
ly subsided doc yuh can say that
to me an get away with it reckon
its true mebbe-but hereafter im
aimin to do my own fightin an
interval of silence then shes a mighty
fine girl
  she is readily agreed the doctor
an say she loves me proudly de-
clared the gunfighter
  congrats bennison extended a
hand still steady despite the number
of years his system had been absorbing
whiskey im only half-shot this morn-
ing hallock so i know what im talk-
ing about and am sincere
  uh-huh well yuh aint answered
my question doc how soon i feel
fit right now to lift a corner o hell
let me see that wound
  hallock stripped off outing shirt and
undershirt and bennison made careful
examination sore he asked press-
ing the healed spot
  no
  fight when youre ready then
take em one at a time youre not in
shape for a free-for-all yet
  keno chalks my ticular meat
others can wait awhile now doc
yuhr bill-
  shut up said bennison crisply
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

or ill be the first man youll have to
lick fists because im a rotten shot
be damn hard for yuh to coax a
fight out o me laughed hallock tell
sam id like to see him when yuh go
down will yuh
  when the saloonkeeper came up he
found hallock cleaning his guns
  chalk downstairs queried hair-
trigger abruptly
  no answered sam dropping on
the edge of the bed and viewing hal-
locks occupation curiously what the
hell yuh up to trigger 
  aiming to settle my score with
chalk yuh heard about last night-
the second time
  sue said shed caught chalk black-
foot an coldiron on the second floor
they sneaked when i wasnt in the
barroom
  yeh an she didnt make much o
her part in it i reckon her way an
yuh savvy but shes stood tween me
an trouble for the last time sam give
chalk this message from me and when
he drifts in an hour from the time yuh
see him ill meet him back o the stage
corrals an shoot it out got that
ye-es drawled sam but i dunno
about deliverin it sue would give me
hell
  if she knew-but dont yuh let her
know im in good shape asked the
doc an sam i wouldnt dare get my-
self shot up after all the care sues
taken o me only thing im afraid of
is that chalk wont grab a-holt the
other end o the snake he aint got a
chance in a hundred an hes wise he
may figger to win by a trick-hes a
crafty coyote-but ill have my wits
workin an my eyes open
uncomfortably the saloon-
keeper consented all right ill
go along with yuh as second an tote
my sawed-off to keep chalks friends
from interferin
  hallock reached over and clapped
him on the back hop to it lemme
know soons yuhve seen him-but care-
ful sue aint around
  yuh bet ill be for my own sake
grimly responded sam and went out
  two hours later he brought the sur-
prising information that chalk galla-
tin had accepted the challenge would
accompanied by blackfoot dixon to act
second meet hallock and brace in an
hour behind the sundown stage com-
panys corrals hallock leaped up and
began pacing the room in front of sam
dominated by the old urge to kill he
even snapped his arm forward in the
motion of throwing a gun then he
stopped dead and the flicker of hell in
his eyes faded
  blood-hongry as ever he la-
mented presenting a long face to sam
death o reckless didnt cure me after
all an ive swore reglar every day-
but yuh cant kill off a thing like
that so quick trigger hafta tame
yuhr nature by degrees no disgrace
in failin down but in givin up thus
sam sagely ive knowed gunfighters
all my life an lots of em reformed
though it was uphill climbin an they
didnt do it in a day or a month an
this here fight thought yuhre the chal-
lengin party is more in the way o
bein self-defense chalks forcin
yuhr hand
  that hour of waiting was the longest
for hallock since he had been down
with his wound ten minutes before
the time set for the duel brace poked
his head in hallocks room
  shove along here trigger sues
gone to the store an the coast is clear
for a few minutes say yuhre lookin
prime 
  hallock was the old hallock from
hat to spurred boots and excepting his
chaps wore his low-slung guns with
the old careless grace his confinement
had not lasted long enough to pale his
	two-gun western novels magazine
tan and he was hardly any thinner now
than he was before his confinement for
he had been well fed
  like a couple of mischievous boys
fearful of encountering sue the gun-
fighter and his second slipped out the
back door of the saloon and walking
along the outskirts of town came in five
minutes to the stockade corrals in the
rear of the stage-station there was a
clearing north of the corrals which had
been used many times in the past as a
duelling-ground by those who had not
settled their differences summarily in
main street or the saloons and dance
halls
  theres happy hoofs whistlin to
yuh smiled sam as a pinto thrust its
head over the pickets of the high corral
and shrilly welcomed the approaching
hallock
  happy hoofs the gunfighters sad-
dle mare and pet boarded with the
stage horses the station-keeper cale
halpin was a friend of hallocks there-
fore ignored the stage companys rules
regarding horses other than those be-
longing to the line cale put in an ap-
pearance at the back door of the station
while hair-trigger was fondling the
mares handsome head
   lo trigger glad to see yuh lookin
so pert cale came down to the cor-
rals with his hand out had a siege
didnt yuh say do you know that
paint gal needs exercise a lot-an-
uh-brules cayuse too are you go-
in to ride the mare
  not now exchanging lead with
chalk gallatin here in a few minutes
stick around and see the smoke said
hallock staring hard into space at the
mention of recklesss name
  chalk gal-wheren hell did he get
the nerve to fight yuh the station-
man couldnt make it
  out of a bottle i reckon-or
mebbe hes stayin sober an dependin
on his tricky wits
hphey lounged against the corral
	waiting when the hour was up
chalk had not appeared still they
waited hallock remarked that he
could excuse chalk for not being
punctual at his own funeral not until
fifteen twenty minutes had passed did
doubt arise in his mind shared equally
by brace and halpin
  reckon hes cornin said sam the
first to voice the question in the minds
of all
  if he dont im goin after him even
if sue sees me hallock rejoined his
eyes deadly behind half-closed lids
  neither hide nor hair of chalk at
the end of a half hour so hair-trigger
and the saloonkeeper left cale chewing
a speculative cud and headed around
into main street they had not pro-
ceeded far when sam grasped hallocks
arm
  say taint hoss sense to go canterin
round in full bloom this way trigger
he might be hidin anywheres an
its just struck me whats his likeliest
game to lay for you in the elkhorn
savvy
  yuh mean said the gunfighter
hed figger on me gettin tired waitin
at the corrals an goin back to the elk-
horn an when i drifted in the front
door hed bang me off
  just that
  good head sam and yuhre right
well checkmate im-go in the back
way turn down here heading in be-
tween two shacks he may have spies
lookin for us to show up on main
street an warn him were cornin
  they entered the elkhorn by the
rear door and hallock pushed ahead
into the barroom expecting to catch
chalk off guard but chalk was not
there only a few minor characters in
the turgid life of derringer these
men manifested surprise at the sudden
looming of hair-trigger panoplied for
war and wearing his fighting face and
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

so dearly was it genuine surprise that
the gunfighter surmised chalk had not
spread word of the challenge issued by
the man he packed a notch for
 anybody seen chalk hallock
asked standing behind the bar and
sweeping his glance around to receive
negative replies from every quarter
the bartender on duty hadnt laid eyes
on chalk since the latter talked with his
boss
  hair-trigger turned away from the
bar and confronted sam brace who
was leaning against the back-bar cud-
dling his sawed-off reckon he jump-
ed the town the gunfighter asked
  dunno what to think-hes cheatin
somehow yuh can put yuhr gilt on
that
  just then a deering the store-
keeper scrambled over the elkhorn
stoop and staggered rather than walked
into the barroom he had a handker-
chief tied around his head and it was
splotched with telltale red
  gimme a drink he gasped lurch-
ing up to the bar and clinging there
whisky - no chaser he gulped
down a drink tall enough to oil his
organ of phonation and stiffen his wilt-
ing legs then shot a forefinger at sam
brace who jumped as if a gun had
been stuck in his paunch yuh know
where yuhr daughter is sam no yuh
dont i dont need to ask or yuh
wouldnt be standin there so cam
well to make it short an snappy that
lousy pup chalk gallatins run off with
her yep as sam leaped a foot off
the floor and hallock called on his
maker to damn the soul of chalk she
was buyin stuff in my place half hour
or more ago we was the only two
in the store while sue was selectin
some canned goods off a shelf i heard
two hosses come up chalk was rid-
ing one an leadin t other he stopped
only a minute to sling a look in the door
from the saddle then rode on around
the corner down the alley tween my
store an spokane harrys dance hall
i didnt think much about it not even
when chalk come walkin in the front
door a few minutes after but it did
make me take notice yuh betche when
the son-of-a-gun shut the door an
dropped the bar he had a gun out an
told me not to move me nor sue either
she gave him the scornful eye an i
betche shed give him somethin else
if thered been a weppin handy i
know her spunk yuh ready to go
ridin sue chalk says hard an she
asks him if hes crazy yeh over yuh
he says gettin closer to us all the time
i was out from behind the counter an
wonderin how i could turn the tables
on the coyote when all of a sudden he
jumps on me an hammers me on the
head with his colt butt course my
light goes plumb out an what happened
to sue after it did is only guesswork
fars im concerned when i come to
i was tied up with clothesline from my
own stock an stuff was scattered all
over the floor showin what a fight sue
had put up agin him say if he hadnt
had a gun bet she could a licked him
bare-handed well the door was still
shut but unbarred for pretty soon a
customer come in an found me an
i-
i tallock and brace were by this
a  time going through the front door
on fast feet the hangers-on in the
barroom under urge of excitement
rather than from any real desire to help
piled after the gunfighter and sam
but halted in close ranks when hallock
wheeled on them and thundered
  this is a two-man posse dont
want none o yuh scum taggin along
not knowin how many of yuh mightve
been wise to the dirty game an kept
yuhr lips buttoned
  and he would have perked his guns
and killed them for rats only that he
	two-gun western novels magazine
anticipated need of all his cartridges
and every second of time was precious
both he and brace were so stunned by
the abduction that they exchanged but
few words as they hurried along the
street
  ill get my hoss an meet yuh back
the stage station sam said suddenly
directing his steps aside as they came
abreast of the livery-stable
  hallock nodded wordless and
pushed on half-running he kept his
eyes open hoping to see one of chalks
side-kicks wondered if dixon and mc-
clintock had quit town with him the
thought of sue helpless in such a crowd
almost maddened him he derived
some relief from the reflection that
chalk worthless as he was otherwise
doubtless had real affection for sue and
would protect her-unless her continual
rebuffs and of him and his knowledge
of her love for hallock had turned this
regard to hate that was possible
  the gunfighter dashed into the stage
station shouting at cale halpin im
wantin happy hoofs damn pronto
  think im up in canady snorted
cale putting fingers in his ears then
as the full power of the blazing eyes
shocked him into activity cmon
trigger right this way to yuhr hoss
an saddle i shore aint danglin nor
askin questions when yuh looks like
that
  he plunged out the back door with
hallock on his heels and ran to the
stable where the horses were quartered
in winter from the harness-room he
dragged forth hair-triggers riding-
gear while the gunfighter hastened over
to the corral in which happy hoofs
was impounded sound of her mas-
ters voice brought the eager pinto
pounding up the instant hallock un-
barred the gate he never had to use
a rope on happy hoofs-and rarely
spurs while he was deftly saddling
hair-trigger told the palpitating station
keeper enough to make him understand
the situation
  when i see yuh agin sue will be
ridin leg an leg with me hallock
exclaimed springing astride and rolling
the dust toward main street sam
brace charging along the thoroughfare
on his mettlesome nag almost collided
with his prospective son-in-law
  wheren hell we goin to head
sam barked aint nobody seen em
i reckon nless it was dixon or me-
clintock an mebbe they was in the
party spose we see if we can foller
the trail from the alley by deerins
store
  hallock was on the point of agree-
ing to tackle this uncertainty when his
nervously roving eye descried a fami-
liar figure on the board sidewalk in
front of spokane harrys saloon and
dance hall
  coldiron he roared see sam
an hes lookin this way well find
out what he knows
t tappy hoofs was so crazy to run
that all hallock had to do was
slacken her reins a little and she was
off at arrow-speed in a few jumps
the gunfighter was alongside the angu-
lar bad man mcclintock with sam
slashing along in his dust-to be in at
the death if there was one holding up
the paint mares head with a firm hand
hallock leaned from the saddle
  mac i can see from the grin on
yuhr ugly mush yuh know whats up
id know yuh was lyin if yuh said yuh
didnt wheres chalk
  he aint livin here no more trig-
ger went over to pinecreek to get
married an he aint cornin back
this coldiron said with a leer hands
studiously held off from proximity to
the guns he packed
  heres a cure for that grin o yuhrs
mac hallock snarled and his fist
lashed out as he stood up in the stirrups
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

  coldirons head rocked backward
and he staggered a few paces and fell
his nose and mouth smashed to bloody
pulp he lay with his head and should-
ers in the hoof-marked street the rest
of his body sprawled across the board-
walk while hallock lifted the reins and
charged away in swirling dust
  gone to pinecreek to get spliced
he bellowed at brace as the latter spun
his horse about and spurred it to keep
pace with happy hoofs theres a
sky pilot there
  thirty miles replied sam good
thing our hosses is fresh
  a colt boomed behind them the
bullet did not fall anywhere near but
hallock turned for a brief glance rear-
ward the bloody-visaged mcclintock
swayed on his feet on the boardwalk a
smoke-wisping gun in one hand on a
chance hallock jerked loose a colt and
fired back but the range was too long
for close shooting at the pace happy
hoofs was traveling the last hallock
saw of coldiron he was still upright
chapter vi
the footpath way
 ijound leather gritted hal-
lock as they lopped off a mile of
the thirty to pinecreek might
be able to catch up this side if we dont
pick no daisies hows that cayuse o
yuhrs travel sam
  burns ground an will go till he
drops though i reckon yuhr mare has
a mite more bottom sam was
thoroughly alive to happy hoofs fine
points
  if id thought yuh couldve hair-
pinned recklesss hoss he wouldnt
let the paint pass him but yuhll hafta
make out best yuh can
  dont hold in for me trigger if i
drop any behind sues the one were
thinkin of now
  they were sweeping mountainward
across a plain tufted with bunch-grass
yellow and dead-looking and scattered
patches of sage-brush
  strike yuh odd that coldiron would
tell us where chalks headin for dont
think he was shootin us off on the
wrong trail do yuh brace called
across to the grimfaced gunfighter
  no i reckon he talked straight
opined hallock facing his companion
he figgered chalk had start aplenty
to beat us an aimed to keep his own
hide whole-knew id ventilate him
short order if he didnt come across
he wouldnt get himself shot up to
protect chalk aint that much of a
fool
  i shore hope yuhr dopes correct
said brace grabbing at his hat as the
wind got under the brim and threatened
to lift it
  but hallock had erred somewhat in
judging the reason for coldirons will-
ingness to talk in fact neither the gun-
fighter nor brace had given chalk gal-
latin due credit for the craftiness which
existed behind his white mask of a face
they knew he was tricky but-
  whats that smoke ahead dyuh
reckon hallock pointed with his
left hand
  they had covered the eight-mile
sweep of plain and plunged into a val-
ley of the cuddy paw mountains the
lower slopes were thickly grown with
tamarack red fir and yellow pine and
the men were riding the high trail on
the valleys rim above the timber but
the smoke was not coming from the di-
rection of the trees it plumed and
writhed out and upward from the lean-
ing wall of the valley right in their
path when they should round a bulging
shoulder
  trigger it might be anything burn-
in observed the saloonkeeper tim-
	two-gun western novels magazine
bers scarce this high up mostly noth-
in but grass we only got a few yards
to go an then we can see
  by god hallock swore suddenly
his eyes flaming as the truth flashed
home and striking his saddle-horn with
his fist by god he repeated and
showed brace his distorted face which
awed the saloonkeeper accustomed as
he was to the fiendish twists hallock
could give to his features its the
bridge across the valley thats burn-
in and he thrust in the spurs
somewhat to the paint mares anger
for she was doing her best
i tallock reached the turn in the
 trail many yards in advance of
sam brace and pulled up what he saw
made him tremble with anger as the
unnecessary spurring was making the
pinto quiver with a like emotion the
wooden bridge which spanned the val-
ley at this point-fifty feet across was
in flames the thick smoke drifted to-
ward horse and rider enwrapping them
happy hoofs shook her head and her
eyes rolled with something akin to fear
but hallock was grim and statuesque
brace came along larruping his mount
while the gunfighter sat thus
  yuh might say he turned on the
appalled saloonkeeper speaking husk-
ily for the smoke was not without its
effect on his vocal cords that chalk
burns his bridges behind him
  it was grim humor considering that
the distance to pinecreek was seventy-
five miles by any other trail and that
haste was imperative the bridge
tinder-dry as there had been no rain in
that part of montana for a month or
more had fallen easy prey to flame
to start the fire hallock judged that
chalk had piled sun-cured bunch-grass
on the far end the flames had eaten
more than halfway across to the side
where they sat their horses and the
middle sagging dangerously gave way
of a sudden and dragging even the un-
burned section from its moorings the
whole smoking flame-shooting mass
rattled and crashed seventy feet to the
floor of the valley
  an the only other route is seventy-
five miles half around the cuddy
paws sam brace exclaimed w-hite-
faced a burro couldnt make it down
this side o the valley an yuhd need
wings to go up the other side
  chalk shore is a slick article con-
ceded hallock easy to see now why
coldiron talked-chalk told im what
he was goin to do o course that
injun dixon maybe with em too an
he aint lackin cunnin mightve been
his idea say sam he shook himself
no use sittin here like a coupla bumps
on a log we got to find another way
across-no time to go down and
around
  just take the lead an show me
trigger im willin to try anything
replied sam who was himself up a
stump that bridge bein down cuts
off the stage due sevenin in derringer
too
  hallock did not hear the last he
had lifted happy hoofs reins and was
ambling on around the winding trail
which hugged the almost perpendicular
valley wall
  whats that-another bridge
hallock turned a surprise face back
upon brace and pointed ahead when
they had ridden a mile or more up the
valley at that distance it certainly
did look like another bridge spanning
the chasm
  cant be-there was only the one
sam was skeptical but kept his horse
close at the tail-end of happy hoofs
  when they got nearer they saw it was
the huge trunk of a tree the valley
norrowed at this point to about forty
feet but the drop below was just as
great as down by the fallen bridge the
log had not been placed in its present
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

firm position by accident the side up-
permost had been smoothed off with an
ax making a footpath about four feet
in width
  mustve been used as a foot-bridge
by the miners up this way before the
gold veins pinched out hallock re-
marked as they sat their saddle at
gaze that other bridge was only
built a coupla years wasnt it
  yeh said sam but i never knew
about this one-never came up this far
because when i went anywhere across
the valley always took the reglar
bridge miners was gone from these
parts long before i hit derringer that
was a minin camp one time yuh know
  looks as if itd stood the weather
pretty well hallock remarked his
eye on the tree-bridge pretty narrow
for a hoss but if any four-legged critter
can go across its happy hoofs the
both of us are willin to try anything
once eh girl patting the sleek neck
an for sue wed try it twice sam
im startin id say a prayer if i
knew any
  it was going to be a ticklish feat the
gunfighter was well aware he had
tested the paint mares nerve frequently
and always found it good but not in
just this way before urged by her
masters voice and rein-hand happy
hoofs ambled to the tree then halted
and tossed her head as if in misgiving
  now dont be shakin yuhr head
girl rebuked hallock softly room
enough for yuh to put yuhr hoofs if
yuh do it dainty an careful im right
with yuh even if yuh should slip-
which yuh aint a-goin to amble girl
were wastin time
fxne would have thought from the
movement of the paints ears that
she understood every word her actions
manifested her nervousness but so
strong was the love for her rider and her
confidence in him that happy hoofs
held back no longer she stepped
cautiously forward and with hallock
talking to bolster up her courage
covered ten feet or so then she hesi-
tated the dizzy abyss swam under-
neath
  not halfway yet girl spoke the
gunfighter but if yuh want to rest
go to it dont look down but straight
across to where were goin
  presently the paint moved slowly on
again another ten feet and she
stopped the tree was shaking in a
way calculated to freeze the hearts of
horse and rider there was no going
back however forward was the only
course hallock thought the motion
of the precarious bridge resulted from
the strain he and happy hoofs were
putting on the middle partly that was
the cause but there was another
looking behind he saw sam brace
guiding his horse across the saloon-
keepers face was white his mount was
not doing even as well as happy hoofs
it would stop every few feet and swing
its head and sam evidently was al-
most incapable of speech to urge it on
he should have waited until hallock
crossed before starting and the gun-
fighter would have spoken to him had
he not depended on sams common
sense two horsemen on the log foot-
path simultaneously might be more
pounds of bone and flesh than the sea-
soned bridge could sustain but this
was not the time nor place to remon-
strate the thing to do was to go on
as rapidly as possible and clear the way
for brace and happy hoofs was
suddenly averse to going another step
she gazed into nothingness on either
side of her and snorted a little that
meant her nerve was failing hallock
knew the signs
  stand still girl ordered hallock
in his smoothest tone resolving sud-
denly what was best to do clinging
close to the animals body and holding

two-gun western novels magazine
her head up by short-reining he eased
out of the saddle felt for the tree with
one foot then placed the other beside
it fortunately happy hoofs did not
move
  hallock glanced back at the saloon-
keeper whose mount had balked again
and called in a steady voice better
get off an walk sam choke the bridle
too but if yuh feel his hoofs slippin let
go an save yuhrself
  sam quavered an unintelligible reply
and imitating hallocks method of dis-
mounting as nearly as he could got
down
  now take yuhr time sam its
shaky business but not so hard the
gunfighter counseled to steady him
then went to the head of happy hoofs
and gripping the bridle short started
to lead her
  the mare did not balk now where
her master could go she could follow-
it was application of a bit of horse
psychology on hallocks part-and the
firm hand at the bridle heartened the
paint closer and closer loomed safety
ten feet-five-hallock and happy
hoofs tood on terra firma but the
gunfighter could not draw a long breath
while sam was still en route he faced
the log watching the slow and hesitant
progress of man and mount with nerves
strung taut up until today he had
always imagined himself practically
nerveless
  welcome to earth sam the gun-
fighter exclaimed in a voice tinged with
relief as sam and his horse stepped to
safety foolish for yuh to start right
after me but- he hardly had the
heart to be harsh with the man he was
patently so near collaspe and now that
the danger was past that was a
nerve-tickler wasnt it huh when
i die i want my boots to be off yessir 
a wish which would never have been
fulfilled had he continued to hell-pal-
around with reckless brule
er answer the saloonkeeper dropped
his horses reins and stretched him-
self flat on the ground and closed his
eyes hair-trigger accorded his silent
sympathy his own nerves tingled un-
comfortably at the remembrance of
how the bottom of the valley looked
from the middle of the bridge how out-
of-reach firm ground seemed
  yuhre as white as chalk almost
he addressed the shut-eyed brace an
mebbe i aint so nut-brown myself
  wish i had four fingers o xxx to
start my heart pumpin agin said
sam slowly systems full o floatin
icebergs i aint even sweatin
  hallock laughed and sat down on a
rock take yuhr time but dont take
too long
  sam opened his eyes and got up im-
mediately sue needed him just as soon
as he could reach her how could he
have forgotten for a moment and ling-
ered he was in the saddle ahead of
hallock swiftly impatient to be off
the gunfighter swung to happy hoofs
and they headed back to the place
where the far end of the bridge had
rested way below them the saw the
charred and broken timbers still smok-
ing following the broad road around
the valley wall which was used by the
stage as well as horsemen they gradu-
ally descended and flicked through a
pass at the base of the cuddy paws
  they sailed into pinecreek at a
thundering gallop drawing many an
anxious female eye to curtained win-
dows for it was not infrequently that
desperadoes from derringer painted
red their quiet neighbor town despis-
ing its tendency to be law-abiding and
pinecreek had had a very recent scare
eagerly the eyes of the two-man posse
sought among the horses hitched in the
street for a glimpse of a hammer-headed
bay that would be chalk gallatins

  hey pop wheres yuhr preacher
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

peg his hat hallock yelled at a long-
whiskered party who was making a
doughty stand in front of the general
store while his cronies fled at the advent
of the hardriding derringer man
  up there next to the church re-
torted the old man pointing with his
cane if yuhd ride in decent once in
awhile an git some gospel yuh wouldnt
have to ask
  o course hed be livin near the
church-where else hallock said to
brace half-grinning and ignoring the
pinecreekers broadside tell yuh the
truth id forgot there was one-an
that a church comes in the same pack-
age with a preacher
  they reined toward the lowly par-
sonage at the other end of pinecreeks
main street adjoining the log-and-
frame church but no horses were
visible outside and sams face showed
deep disappointment
  if hes been here hes gone on-
that burned bridge broke the trail for
us groaned brace who unaccustomed
to much riding was already saddle-
galled and almost pop-eyed with
anxiety for his daughters safety as
ior hallock he was as full of energy
as if he had never been sick and his
late wound was entirely out of his mind
he was prepared not to find sue and
her abductor in pinecreek therefore
did not experience the deep disappoint-
ment that his companion did and if
sue was mrs gallatin-a likelihood-
she would be a widow the minute he
could get near enough to chalk to sling
a gun
  determined to learn the worst at
once and incidentally any other in-
formation the preacher possessed which
would aid pursuit hallock flung happy
hoofs reins over her head and ap-
proached the door of the parsonage
  stay in the saddle he called back
over his shoulder as sam kicked rff a
stirrup we re only here a minute
a thin pale woman responded to
hallocks knuckle tattoo her
pallor he devined was not natural but
the outward sign of inward trepidation
he imagined himself the cause at first
well aware of his forbidding aspect
  i aint meanin a mite o harm
maam he reassured the lady im
just aimin for to get a lil information
is the preacher about
  hes-hes inside she tremblingly
replied im his wife it wasnt you
who frightened me-it was the man
who was hre awhile ago and - and shot
my husband no he isnt dead she
hastened to say as hallock started
suspecting he could give the killer a
name wounded in the arm the
doctor says hell be all right
  was the feller who did it a tallish
sorta cowboy cuss with a face as white
as a herefords-an was a strappin-
i mean maam a big dark-haired girl
with him
  mrs saunders the preachers wife
answered affirmatively as he had
scarcely doubted she would she
looked him straight in the eye seemed
on the point of saying something then
hesitated fear struck him turning
him cold
  anything the matter with the girl
maam-shes my promised wife an
itd shore kill me tough as i am to
have anything happen to her just
speak out maam an lemme know the
worst
  mrs saunders marveled that his
hardlined face could express such
anxiety over the welfare of another
he looked like a man who would ride
blithely through hell and bulldog the
devil if necessary-all whalebone and
rawhide and utterly careless of him-
self but not a man who could feel
genuine apprehension yet there it
was stark in his steely eyes
  lady implored hallock lifting a
hand when she did not reply immedi-
	two-gun western novels magazine
ately he mistaking the reason sam
brace sitting near at hand and an
agonized listener was ready to go
through the motions of assault and
battery if she didnt answer soon
  pardon me for staring apologized
mrs saunders though hallock hadnt
noticed she was the girl was-well
shes quite large and strong you know
and it looked to me as if she had fought
the man strenuously and he had-ah-
beaten her with a quirt butt to subdue
her there was blood on one side of
her face she was black and blue and
she seemed exhausted to the point
where she could no longer resist and
the man had to help her along he
was bruised and scratched himself-
god almighty shouted hallock
thereby horrifying mrs saunders
yuh hearin-all this sam whirling
and satisfied at once by the bloated ap-
pearance of the fathers face were
out for that wolfs pelt maam he
panted turning again to the preachers
wife thats the girls daddy hangin
to his horn so yuhr husband didnt
marry em none how come
  mrs saunders knew something was
wrong of course as soon as he saw
their condition especially the girls
the cowboy-beast i should say-
an yuh never spoke truer maam
hallock was guilty of interrupting his
eyes glittering
  ordered mr saunders to get his
book continued the woman as if hal-
lock had not spoken and the girl who
was very near swooning declared she
would not be married to him the man
saw mr saunders was going to balk
and drew his gun and commanded
do as i say if you dont ill kill
you mr saunders told him to shoot
and he did-but only in the arm bad
enough of course and i fainted think-
ing my husband had been killed when
i came to they were gone
  then said hallock on a note of
disappointment yuh dunno which way
they headed mebbe though his
gloom lifting a trifle some other pine-
crackers saw-
  my husband can tell you which
direction they took he ran out after
them wounded as he was and tried
to get some men to pursue them but-
she paused flushing with sudden
shame
  couldnt eh snarled hallock
startling her by his vicious look and
tone not a man with the guts to go
huh say id admire to turn this
snivellin burg topside derringer may
not be so lily-white as pinecreek but
its got all the guts an gall-no maam
parding but it aint i was forgettin
yuhr husband might i see him
yuh hurry up hear me bawled
the anguished sam brace after hallock
as mrs saunders stood aside for him
to enter my god think o that
honey-girl o mine all beat up by that
goddam son-
iwirs saunders closed the door
 she led the hatless gunfighter into
a dim little library where the preacher
minus his coat and with bandaged arm
in sling half reclined in an armchair
  i want said hallock giving the
rev saunders his name when mrs
saunders turned inquiringly to shake
yuhr hand sir an tell yuh yuhve al-
tered my idea o preachers which be-
fore wasnt none flatterin yuh helped

  he wheeled and almost ran from the
house north he shouted at sam
brace as he hit the saddle
chapter vii
hallock sees red
 hows were on the right trail
all right thats shore his bay
hair-trigger up beside the inert
carcass of a horse lying just off-trail
its hind legs sticking from a clump of
bushes the dead animal was equipped
with all its leather gear
  hallock and brace were five miles
out of pinecreek and had followed the
main-traveled trail due north not cer-
tain they were on the right track al-
though the reverend saunders had seen
chalk and sue depart in that direction
until they encountered the body of
gallatins horse slipping quickly from
happy hoofs and crashing into the
brush hallock found on examination
that the bay had broken its right fore-
leg just above the fetlock stepped in
a hole somewhere which resulted in its
being shot
  that slows him up considerable
said sam hopefully as hallock strode
out of the bushes reporting his one
hossll hafta carry double now its a
cinch blackfoot dixon didnt decamp
with him or hed been along ochalk in
pinecreek dont yuh think
  yeh nodded hallock absently he
wasnt caring whether dixon-or a
dozen of his breed-was ahead of him
so long as he reached end of trail in
the shortest time happy hoofs could
carry him he was squatting over the
trail looking for the hoofmarks of
gallatins remaining horse the one sue
had been riding at the start hallock
was not as good at trail-finding as he
was squinting over a gunsight nor was
brace any better his specialties being
shotgun expertness and the mixing of
drinks but it required little more than
good eyesight to pick out the deeper in-
dentations of shoes telltale of extra
weight put upon the horse
  we can be shore sam said hal-
lock rising and lifting foot to stirrup
that were on his track now trails
as open as print an he cant be so
far away now
  they pointed out following the deep
hoofmarks these led at a tangent from
the road north finally circled and
strung south
  hes doublin back hallock re-
marked leaning over his horses shoul-
der as he galloped my guess is hes
makin for the cuddy paws where he
figgers to hole up only about a thou-
sand places to hide in them mountains
losin that hoss he had to change his
plans cant reach em before night
though slow as hes hittin it an we
oughta catch him
  the heartening words however did
not smooth the wrinkles of worry from
sams brow what the thwarted and
desperate gallatin might do to sue was
an uncertainty which kept his nerves
strung to the breaking point i aint
used to callin on god except to damn
me or my enemies said the saloon-
keeper but im askin him to protect
sue
  yuh sound religious as hell sam
commented hallock and was serious
  they flung down a coulee with their
horses at full stride sams mount
scampering at the tail of happy hoofs
and emerging from the mouth of the
dry ravine found themselves on the
stage trail involuntarily hallock
lifted his eyes from the ground glanc-
ing south and fires of mingled hate and
joy kindled in his heart he shouted
no words just shouted and sam brace

two-gun western novels magazine
seeking the cause of the outburst
echoed him and got a head start of
happy hoofs by a wicked plunge of
the spurs in the next moment or two
however hallock passed him leaning
into the wind like a cyclone
i talf a mile down the stage road
  	the battered and bullet-scarred
old concord preserved from early min-
ing days in the region was halted the
driver was leaning over his heat evi-
dently arguing with chalk gallatin who
stood just beneath him near the coach
a horse with low-hanging head swayed
on its last legs it fell over suddenly
at the roadside sue sat upon a rock
her head bowed upon her arms crossed
on her knees while hallock and
brace sped nearer and nearer chalk
gallatin abruptedly pulled his gun and
pointed it up at the driver who was evi-
dently obstinate about something the
drivers hands slowly arose to a level
with his hat-brim whether chalk in-
tended to pull trigger anyhow was
problematical for at that instant he
heard the charging horses and whirled
the stage driver lowered his hands and
stared
  hallock racing now far in advance
of brace clung with his knees and
yanked up both guns simultaneously
the tubes threw bullets but the range
was too great for anything but a high-
powered rifle at the roar of the guns
sue braces head came up and she
stood waving feebly but evidently the
effort was too much for her snapped
powers for she sank again upon the
rock
  with the avenger closing in chalk
gallatin realizing the futility of stand-
ing up to him did the unexpected
sheathing his gun he sprang suddenly
over the coach wheel to the box and
wrestling an instant with the driver
taken entirely unawares by the cow-
boys maneuver burled the old man off
the high seat to the ground chalk
then seized the reins from the foot-
board snatched the lash from the whip-
socket and cracked the leaders into a
sudden plunge the wheelers were
jerked along and getting their feet
imitated the pace set by the frightened
team in front
  happy hoofs spurting valiantly
shot by sue and the cursing stage
driver as the latter was picking him-
self from the dust a most amazed man
to find no bones broken so intent was
hallock on overtaking his quarry that
he never looked sues way as he passed
her her father pounding up some
minutes later was out of the saddle be-
fore his mount had stopped running
he dashed for the girl horrified by her
appearance she arose took several
faltering steps and was clasped in his
arms
  hair-trigger drew near enough to
the racing stagecoach to shoot chalk
off his perch if he so desired chalk
realized what an inviting target he was
atop the stage and was leaning over as
far as he could the reins wrapped
around his arms high heels planted
firmly against the foot-board but hal-
locks guns were suddenly stilled and
gallatin wondered why-couldnt be
the gunfighter had run out of ammuni-
tion as a matter of fact hallock had
changed his mind about the method of
killing his enemy a bullet would be
too ordinary too easy his bare hands
must do the job
  to do this he must first get chalk
alive in his hands which presented a
problem the coach was whirling along
a trail that stretched almost level for
several miles toward the cuddy paw
mountains chalk was high-lining the
four-in-hand and really wasting energy
for they had the bits in their teeth and
would not have slowed up for a preci-
pice in their path it occurred to hal-
lock first of course to shoot the stage

horses but this as a lover of horse-
flesh and not from any reluctance to
destroy property of the sundown stage
company he hated to do except as a
last resort
ttappy hoofs grabbing ground
a a as if she had not been run hard all
afternoon thrust her nose past the
coach window hallock pondering the
problem of how to stop the stage and
nail his quarry glanced involuntarily
at the rapid-turning wheels his guns
swinging from the loose grip of his
hands against his legs came swiftly
into position aimed low they began
to roar a continuous volley hands
that never missed were streaming those
bullets and the spokes in the revolving
rear wheels were split and broken by
the hard-driven lead the felloes
denied the support of most of the
spokes slewed suddenly at a forty-five
degree angle and the coach lurched to
one side like a drunkard thrown off
balance the ruined wheel lay down
and the hub striking the ground
dragged along it several yards before
the four-in-hand gave up pulling but
chalk gallatin was no longer on the
drivers box puzzlement found place
beside chalks cold fear when hallocks
colts began their incessant pounding
which emptied both cylinders-what
was the man shooting at he had
never been known to waste lead-and
then the question was answered by the
sidewise lunge of the furiously driven
concord chalk keyed up to take any
chance even the slimmest swung down
from the leaning coach on the offside
a second or two before it completely
stopped either side of the stage road
was a steep embankment covered with
brush the height of a mans shoulder
and thick and tangled like jungle
growth chalk without hesitation
sprang from the edge of the road into
this gray and brown and yellow maze
and headed straight down he cared not
where so long as he escaped his
nemesis
  plallock saw chalks figure whisk off
the box but could not have shot at him
if he would-he had shaken every load
from his guns in demolishing the wheel
he heard the crashing of the brush as
the bad cowpuncher drove into it
the gunfighter spilled the twelve empty
shells on the ground shoved fresh cart-
ridges into the chambers then swung
off happy hoofs and headed around
the end of the coach he was cautious
about showing himself on the edge of
the bank for the good reason that al-
though it had taken him but a few
seconds to reload the noise of gallatins
descent had abruptly ceased and it sug-
gested that he was lying in wait for
hallocks figure to loom above him
finding the proverbial needle in the
haystack would have been childs play
compared to locating chalk on the
brushy slope without exposing oneself
hallock stood only a few minutes
irresolute racking his brains to hit
upon some scheme which would reduce
the high degree of danger not that he
was afraid but he would have deemed
it a disgrace to be killed by chalk gal-
latin especially with his vengeance un-
satisfied but the horns of the dilemma
retained their needle-point at the end of
the five minutes and abandoning all
attempt at caution which was useless
anyway he charged yelling and brand-
dishing his colts into the brush
  a six-shooter bellowed about thirty
yards down hallock fell on his face
not because he had been struck how-
ever he had tripped over a boulder
which lay well hidden in the thicket
tangle he did not curse as he raised
himself on his hands his fingers still
twined about the gun-grips that rock
possibly had been a providential stum-
bling block in his path saved him a
drilling-and something else this was

two-gun western novels magazine
on second thought as he sat up and
looked at the boulder it was fairly
round likely it would roll consider-
ing the pitch of the slope by ear alone
had hallock located gallatins position
and it was far from being a reliable
impression he had fallen ere he could
glimpse the weapons smoke which
would have registered it exactly the
thought that came to him as he looked
at the boulder and noted its roundness
he carried out immediately with one
hand he gave it a good start down the
slope in the general direction of the
roaring gun it met with stout resist-
ance from the underbrush but because
of the start given it and its own weight
was able to smash all obstacles
t tallock crawled after the rolling
 boulder keeping in the path it
crushed confident that any noise he
made would be drowned out by the
snap and crunch and swish of twigs
and branches chalks gun suddenly
boomed out again not ten feet away
and hallock heard him curse he had
fired at the boulder then discovered
what he was shooting at and naturally
felt foolish but the boulder had ac-
complished all that hallock had ex-
pected of it drawn chalks fire and
simultaneously covered hallocks ap-
proach to the cowboys vantage-point
the gunfighter sprang up and ran those
last ten feet trusting to luck that
neither rocks nor roots would trip him
this time the steepness of the slope
caused him to descend in long stagger-
ing leaps and he would be at a distinct
disadvantage when he came upon the
cowboy and tried to stop suddenly the
next instant the white face of gallatin
flashed upon hallocks vision the
puncher was on his knees eyes fastened
upon the point in the brush where he
thought hallock would break through
the gunfighter saw chalks six-shooter
swing up for the throw-down as he
dashed upon him hallocks left hand
gun spouted smoky flame and lead the
bullet tearing the cowboys gun from
his fingers the gun with the notch for
hallock
  hair-trigger ran several feet beyond
the kneeling gallatin before he could
stop himself he whirled and sprang
back up the slope dropping his guns
just as chalk was reaching with his
left hand for the fallen iron the fingers
of his right being momentarily para-
lyzed from the shock of the bullet on
the cylinder chalk didnt realize in
the cold frenzy of the moment that his
enemys lead had jammed the cylinder
and the colt was of no use except as
a club armed with a dug against the
vengeance-thirsting hallock-as well
to stab him with a blade of grass
but chalks eager curving fingers
never closed on that tantalizing colt-
handle-a powerful tug at the back of
his shirt collar lifted him from his
knees then he was hurled flat on his
back and hallock dropped astride him
driving the breath from his body and
seemingly crushing his ribs before he
could regain his breath the gunfighters
steel fingers like the gouging talons of
an eagle were fastened in his throat
  yuh woman-beater yuh damned
skulkin coyote roared hallock in the
tones of a temporary madman a bul-
let was too good too quick to buck yuh
out but these bare hands o mine shore
fit yuhr scruvy neck i got a mind
the terrible fingers tightened the eyes
with the dancing devil in them drilled
into the glazing glance of gallatin to
tear yuhr windpipe plumb out
  the cowboys hands instinctively
but weakly futile pushed against hal-
locks heaving chest to the right wrist

end uppermost caught hair-triggers

sight
  sues blood he screamed-a hor-
rible sound like the cry of a mortally
wounded horse - and he pounded
chalks head up and down on the
ground then suddenly he took his
hands from the cowboys throat and
grew dangerously quiet chalk sucked
in the life-giving air with mouth agape
get yuhrself together yuh woman-
rustier snarled the gunfighter bend-
ing forward until their faces almost
touched im a-goin to quirt-bust yuh
like yuh did sue brace before i stop
yuhr clock 
  when chalks breathing became less
labored-hallock sitting on his chest
and watching the signs like a cruel-eyed
eagle-the gunfighter tore the quirt
from gallatins wrist and heaved up
  on yuhr feet now he rasped
take it standin like a man-no he
snorted not like a man but stand up
anyhow yuh lowflung woman-handlin
hound
halk levered himself to a sitting
 posture with his hands spread wide
on either side of him he knew that
he must get up that there was no es-
cape yet he had not the courage to
gather his feet under him
   said up bellowed the avenger
well ill shore help yuh then when
gallatin still sat and stared speechless
and with hand gripping the front of his
shirt yanked chalk erect on his wob-
bly legs damn swore hallock
surveying the cringing figure if yuh
aint a sight to sicken a body
  he stepped backward to where he
had let his guns fall and eyes never
wavering from the face of the man he
intended in the end to kill stooped and
slid one colt in the holster on his left
leg and with the other in his hand he
walked over to his enemy
  yuhr iron said hallock shoving
hi own in chalks empty bolster is
smashed to hell im heelin yuh to
see if yuhve got the guts to dig for can-
non while im beatin yuh-an if yuh
have well go for it an ill show yuh
  but the fact that a sweet-shooting
weapon had been put under his hand
didnt hearten gallatin much he was
barely able to stand from fear and
weakness let alone rise to the supreme
demands of the occasion
  yuhre sayin i beat sue brace
quavered chalk not knowing what else
to say his wits were so jumbled an eye
of dread on the lash hallock was pull-
ing slowly through his fingers in wicked
anticipation but i didnt hallock

   thats for lyin snarled hair-trig-
ger and cut him across the face the
course of the thongs marked in blood-
red welts on the dead white skin in-
voluntarily tears sprang to chalks
eyes he yelped that shore matches
the scratches sue put on yuhr mush try-
in to get away from yuh the avenger
declared pleased with the result but
ive only just started
  with all the vigor of his arm he at-
tacked gallatins head and shoulders
the stinging biting rawhide trailed
one long welt after another across the
pale visage until it was no longer pale
but had the appearance of fine-chopped
meat chalks hands and wrists were
laid open his sleeves torn ragged from
trying to shield his face pain-mad-
dened at last to the point of forgetting
his fear he suddenly dropped his arms
and screaming curses to with a man
grabbed for the colt hallocks red-
rimmed eyes glinted-with what emo-
tion it would have been hard to say
possibly a fiendish joy that he had
whipped his cowardly foe into showing
resistance chalk had the gun almost
clear of the open-mouther holster when
hnllock shifting his grip on the quirt
crashed the loaded end on the cowboys
head unprotected as his sombrero had

fallen off at the time the gunfighter
threw and choked him a second time
gallatin fell on his side arms outflung
entirely relaxed the gun he had tried
to draw stuck half out of the scabbard
hallock bent jerked it up and thrust it
in his own blood from the wound in-
flicted by the butt-end blow coursed
rapidly down chalks countenance and
dripped from his chin
  mrs saunders that gospel-sling-
ers wife spoke o sues face bein
bloody yuh yellow cur hallock re-
marked to the insensible man an sos
yuhrs to play hunk
tie threw away the quirt and
  	drew a sleeve across his sweating
face feeling the effect of his strenuous
session but he was not yet free from
the spell of the ugly nightmare driving
him to the consummation of his venge-
ance chalk continued to lie without
movement and hallock well knew that
he was not shamming unconsciousness
after a long moment the gunfighter
reached down clamped iron fingers on
one of chalks wrists and dragged him
like a sack of meal trudged up the slope
along the trail blazed by the rolling
boulder
  lugging his limp burden over the
edge of the bank and around the end
of the coach hallock propped the cow-
boy in sitting position against the
front wheel choking gallatin to
death after trying it nearly to comple-
tion had appealed to hallock as being
as prosaic as shooting-and he recalled
the killing of an indian horse thief
which he had witnessed in his younger
days around deadwood gulch a fit-
ting death for chalk gallatin yellow-
spined bully bushwacker and woman-
stealer tool
  happy hoofs came walking toward
her master whickering softly as if in-
quiring the reason for his prolonged ab-
sence but hallock had no affectionate
pat or word for her now he was in
the clutch of that temporary insanity
which when proven sometimes means
to a murderer the difference between a
life sentence and the electric chair or
hangmans noose unfastening his
coiled lariat from the tie-straps on the
saddle hallock returned to the side of
his victim whose head hung forward
and gong down on one knee fitted the
hampen noose around his neck then
he squatted on his heels in front of
gallatin waiting for his senses to re-
vive he would have assisted chalk
out of his oblivious state but no water
was handy nor had hallock a pocket
flask well he could wait he had to
bide his time until he got his hands on
this damned coyote a few minutes
longer wouldnt matter happy hoofs
inquisitive missing her due caresses
sidled up back of hallock and chewed
his loosely knotted neckerchief then
playfully nipped his ear but he did
not respond which as well as anything
manifested his mental state he just
squatted there immobile all but his
eyes like some grim demon
  presently chalk stirred groaned
then he moved his head a little the
rope did not exert anything like a throt-
tling pressure but it was tight and the
feel of it at his throat did more than
a dash of cold water in the face to
bring back consciousness his eyes
snapped open-to stare into the satanic
countenance of hair-trigger
  been waitin said hallock locani-
cally he straightened
  both of chalks hands went up to
the tight hemp and he pulled at it
shrieking rope good lord trigger
yuh goin to hang me
  yuhll only wish i was replied
hallock im goin to-drag yuh
  chalk raved an i always was
afeared o rope
  yuhre scared like a coyote pup at
everything deep down ceptin mebbe

inclue sue brace yuh had to go some
go the limit by god to get a-holt her
thats why the way yuh treated her
imb makin yuh die hard if twas
only revenge for myself id put a bul-
let in yuh an call it hunk
  chalk gallatin burst into unmanly
tears his teeth clicking with nervous
chill his head had stopped bleeding
but the half-dried blood imparted to
the sudden flood of tears its sanguine
hue and the side of his face which had
been decorated only with quirt-welts
became streaked and crisscrossed ap-
parently with fresh gore he was a
spectacle such as might have aroused
the sympathy a spark at least of most
women and many men but not the
tough-fibred hallock whose brute na-
ture was so strongly developed noth-
ing but disgust plus hatred had he for
the wreck of a man against the wheel
  t rigger - yuh - yuh blubbered
chalk tugging on the hondo to pull the
noose loose yuh wont-shoot-me-
then
t tallock deemed it unnecessary to
  repeat that he wouldnt he had
passed sentence he was judge and
jury of this court all he said was
no use jiggerin with that rope an
gettin it loose ill only put it on
agin dunno any prayers do yuh
gallatin
  trigger slavered chalk knowing
that the prayer-stage meant the end
if yuh wont shoot-gimme-a gun an
ill kill myself rather than the rope
trigger-ill do it
  yuh sneered hallock aint got
the nerve then he changed his mind
dropped into his former position facing
chalk itd be bettern draggin yuh
damned if it wouldnt to watch yuh
work up that much guts try yuh-
its yuhr last chance remember here 
he slid a colt from one holster shov-
ing the butt at the cowpuncher
  chalk clasped the handle and turned
the blued steel muzzle against his fore-
head the hammer lifted slowly as the
finger on the trigger exerted slow pres-
sure then the hammer gently low-
ered chalk brought the muzzle down
in range of his eyes and looked into it
long visioning the burst of fire which
would explode in his brain-an instant
of terrible light and sound then com-
plete darkness he shivered and drew
an oath from hallock he thought then
of the rope tearing at his neck his face
being smashed by rocks his whole body
mangled heart and brain active the
while too long a while-and he jammed
the cold ring again to his head the
hammer rose the hammer fell-but he
jerked the barrel up so that the bullet
whined upward harmlessly he tossed
the gun at hallocks feet with an ani-
mal cry
  i cant-do it i aint fit to die
  hallock filled the empty chamber
he holstered the colt he got to his
feet yuh aint got the nerve to die
yuh mean yuhll never be fitter
cmon im done foolin
  the gunfighter reached over jerked
the noose tight and chalk to his feet
simultaneously hallock did not have
to call happy hoofs she was right at
his elbow a perplexed spectator keep-
ing the rope on his victims neck taut
hallock hooked his left boot-toe in the
stirrup and swung up the mare
started at a lope as soon as she felt her
master in the saddle and chalk grasp-
ing the line with both hands to ease the
strain on his neck ran behind hallock
increased happy hoofs pace with a
word at the same time paying out the
lariat until he had only a few feet left
on the home end which he twirled on
the saddle-horn chalk was running
now at top speed his feet scarcely
seeming to touch the ground his eyes
protruding happy hoofs galloped
	two-gun western novels magazine
gallatin was jerked off his legs and
struck the trail asprawl and was
dragged like a sled he uttered no
sound though maddened with pain
could not for the reason that his mouth
was choked with earth and pebbles
gradually his hold on the taut line
which he had retained with desperation
and despair for many hundred yards
loosened and his arms jerked along
lifelessly
  hallock was picking the roughest
places in the road to ride over heading
back to the spot where chalk had
stopped the stage and then stolen it
the distance was a mile or more hal-
lock could see a horseman approaching
sam brace no doubt despatched by his
daughter to learn what was detaining
the gunfighter far beyond sam hal-
lock could see sue and the stage driver
standing together in the road
chapter viii
thick of the fight
  as sam rode nearer hallock slack-
  za ened the pace of happy hoofs
        so thats how yuh finished

pitiful object at the end of the gun-
fighters rope wellits a terrible death
but he shore earned it hold up trig-
ger for hallock was riding on hes

  hallock drew rein he climbed down

was nauseated by what he saw
  say yuh didnt only drag him did
yuh trigger he exclaimed im
mighty glad i stopped yuh from drag-
gin him up to sue say shed bawl
yuh aplenty for this
  hallock while freeing the noose
which was deeply embedded in chalks
neck related the details of his encoun-
ter with sues abductor for every
blow he give her i cut an slashed him
twice i betche-an i aint seen her
yet the two-gun man declared pas-
sionately rising and beginning to coil
up his rope
  yuhre a devil when yuh get started
trigger breathed sam i wouldnt

demanded looking at the saloonkeeper
squarely out of eyes that were still
flecked with red shes yuhr daughter

him down
  i aint sayin yuh was wrong-thats

calmly id a shot him-nless he

was too strong for her strong as she is
she didnt know nothin about the

that before she got her senses back
when they rode into pinecreek chalk
threatened to kill her if she asked any
body for help-an she says hed done
it too she was so weak she could
hardly set in the saddle-
  im damn glad struck in hallock
vibrantly that gallatin lingered to
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

let he didnt deserve yuh oughta be
thankin me sam stead o findin

  mebbe mebbe said the saloon-
keeper slowly nodding whatcha go-
in to do with the body as the two-
gun man strode to the pinto and tied
up his coiled rope
  leave it to the buzzards barked
hallock he tilted his head back and
scanned the blue vault there he
cried pointing to several wheeling
objects is some aready
  sam shook his head when the gun-
fighter mounted and lifted the reins
sam followed him
  tom cried sue as he galloped up
and flung down
lie did not speak at first gathered
her in his arms held her close-
then at arms length long he gazed
upon the bruises and marks of the quirt-
lash and the bloodstains which sue had
not washed off because there was no
water
  i paid chalk gallatin for all this
he touched her cheek gently with one
finger he dropped his hands from her
shoulders and gave her his profile
yuhr pa kicked some about it he
didnt cotton to the way i killed him
he told the manner of chalks passing
not tryin to excuse myself he de-
clared at the end i got wild-theres
moren a lil devil in my system sue
i reckon im just a barber-yuh know

other side the side youve shown to

tom if its in the wood im going to

love you for that killing instinct but
in spite of it
  that love will cure me if anything
he was facing her now his eyes no
longer bloodshot the savageery eradi-
cated now that im cooled off i feel
-well not sorry exactly but- he
halted groping for the words to prop-
erly express himself
  now when youre not blind with
murderous rage you feel ashamed of
your unnecessary cruelty for having
tortured him like-well like blackfoot
dixon who has indian blood would
have done isnt that what you mean
i reckon it is shore wonderful how
yuh can read me
  she laid one hand on his shoulder
and with the other pointed down-trail
is that chalk lying there in the road
must be of course for the buzzards are
dropping down you meant to leave
him for them-but dont you think bet-
ter of it tom
  he nodded ill bury him got no
shovel or anything but a niche in the
rocks somewheres an other rocks piled
on top will cheat the buzzards an
coyotes sit down sue an rest till i
come back he turned to happy
hoofs
  how about my hearse hallock
spoke up the stage driver rafe sed-
don who with sam brace had kept
silence and in the background until this
moment the old rattlebank looks
broke down from here though its a
good ways

trump the getaway hallock informed

other wheel from pinecreek before yuh

seat
  i was wonderin why hed held yuh

gered to listen
  so was i chimed in brace but i
forgot to ask
tallock and seddon clattered off
	together not long after seddon
returned with his horses mounted on
one of the four hallock had left the
rein-dangling happy hoofs at one side
of the road and gone down the embank-
ment carrying the mangled clay of
chalk gallatin twenty minutes later
he reappeared over the edge of the bank
and loping back reported to the one
women that gallatin was safe forever
from scavengers he then insisted that
she ride the paint mare while he be-
strode one of the stage horses and with
sam and seddon and the extra animals
bringing up the rear hallock and sue
set the pace pinecreek-ward
  arriving after dark hallock said to
sue as he drew rein in front of the gen-
eral store yuhre shore yuh feel all
right to go through with it now
  her yes was vibrant
  then theres no use puttin it off if
yuhre willin to take a chance on a
cashless good-for-nothing like me who
even has to borrow money for a wed-
din ring from his father-inlaw- he
paused then added but ill be able
to pay him back for that soons we get

an outfit agin an hed want i should
have what i can get for em itll be
enough shore to buy railroad tickets

i dunno nothin but gunfightin sue
brace he had dismounted and stood
at the head of happy hoofs looking
up at the girl in the light streaming
from the general store yuhre takin
the longest chance-
  she put fingers on his lips-and he
seized the opportunity to kiss them a
long chance perhaps but im willing
oh very willing she said bending to-
ward him where you will go i will
go and have no doubt that you will find
honorable employment something
will turn up-it always does for the
man who tries hard who wont give up
and now be happy for tonight-its
our wedding night tom she laughed
softly i wont look much like a
bride but after ive washed my face
and fixed my hair which i can do at
the preachers ill feel like one
hallock took the hand he had kissed
in both his own he could only squeeze
it speechless his wonder of woman
had so multiplied that his mind was
awhirl he felt himself groping help-
lessly yet joyously ready girl to
pick that ring he asked
  ill corral these nags an meet yuh
over to the preachers folks called
rafe seddon as sue gave herself into
hallocks arms and hoof-clatter fol-
lowed his words
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

  mr and mrs tom hallock rode side
by side into derringer next morning
they had spent the night by kind in-
vitation at the parsonage and the
saloonkeeper and seddon had put up
at the hotel sam had elected to ac-
company the driver back to the broken-
down stage lending hallock his saddle-
horse the couple had started at dawn
and taken the long trail around the
cuddy paw mountains and although it
was after ten oclock when they turned
into main street the town that was run
by bad men was just awakening a
deering and his clerk were carrying out
goods for display on the store stoop
when they heard hoofbeats recog-
nizing the riders deering let go an arm-
ful and flat-footed out in the street to
meet them his joy at learning of the
death of chalk gallatin was only
equaled by his delight at seeing sue
brace alive and radiant notwithstand-
ing the marks she bore of her recent
experience and when told that they
were man and wife deering pumped
the hand of the gunfighter and ex-
pressed a wish to kiss the bride-
which the bride did not deny him
leaning from the saddle and presenting
a cheek then they rode on past spo-
kane harrys honkatonk in the wide
doorway of which two dance-liall girls
evidencing in disarrayed hair ghastly
faces and soiled attire the wear and
tear of the previous night stood arms
about each other they blinked for
the morning sunlight was painful to
their eyes and flapped languid but
friendly hands at the newly weds hal-
lock had never frequented spokane
harrys but he was something of a
hero in the eyes of the women who lived
on sensationalism and sue was even
more popular because she treated them
as sisters unfortunate but sisters just
the same
  youre a pair to draw to called
one mame for they had heard the con-
versation with the storekeeper
chalk was a damned nuisance luck
you love-birds
yhen they neared the unpainted
 frame building where doc ben-
nison lived and had his office on the
second floor over a blacksmith shop
hallock remarked that his wife had
better stop and have her scalp laid
open by chalks quirt-handle properly
treated and bandaged he would ride
on put up the horses and return for
her
  hallock turned sams saddler in at
the livery stable forked happy hoofs
and laid a course for the sundown
stage-station he had ridden by the
door of the elkhorn bar with danger
farthest from his thoughts when a bul-
let crashed through the saloon window
and ricochetted from his saddlehorn
stung to sudden fury by the treach-
erous attack he did not even stop to
dismount but whirling happy hoofs
spurred her across the stoop and
through the elkhorns door throwing
himself forward to escape the frame
as the dancing hoofs rang on the bar-
room floor a second shot thundered
seeming to rock the walls which con-
fined the sound the malignant bruised
face of coldiron mcclintock peered
through the smoke drifting ceilingward
the bullet had carried away the lobe
of hair-triggers right ear the erratic
motions of the paint mare who had
never been in a saloon before saving
her riders life hallock had unhitched
both guns as he charged in and from
his perch in the saddle he swung one
in line with his enemy coldiron bored
through from chest to back by a forty-
five slug tipped forward firing as he
went down
  yuhll be company for gallatin
shouted hallock and saw other hands
digging for iron it was quite a gather-
ing of his enemies his work was cut

two-gun western novels magazine
out for him sams bartender while he
could not be numbered an enemy could
not be counted on for assistance as the
first exchange of shots had driven him
to cover under the bar
  hallock regretted riding into the
saloon realizing his extreme disadvan-
tage in being higher than the heads of
his enemies a bulls eye for even poor
marksmanship which was unknown in
that gun-toting town and he set about
at once to rectify the mistake he had
made in a flurry of anger to dismount
facing the foe and shooting simul-
taneously was no small feat rendered
more difficult by happy hoofs attack
of skittishness she was ordinarily not
gun-shy but the close quarters the
deafening volume of sound the acrid
choking smoke all combined to craze
her and she wilded up at the critical
moment hallock had withdrawn his
feet from the stirups and was drawing
up his right leg to clear the pommel
when the iron-shod hoofs slipped on the
none-too-clean floor - though there
were a half dozen brass cuspidors in
different parts of the barroom-and the
paint mare crashed down on her left
side pegging one leg of her rider to the
floor and his back against the bar the
aim of three desperadoes was thereby
spoiled and the bullets slammed into
the side-wall of the saloon so close to-
gether that they bored one large hole
  nothing daunted by the mishap hal-
lock whanged away from the floor get-
ting two of the ambitious artillerists in
as many seconds get up girl get
up he kept repeating and the paint
mare recovering quickly from the
shock of the fall struggled hard one
black-bearded patane thinking to take
advantage of hallock while he was
down stole forward on the balls of his
feet for a close shot the mares move-
ments in trying to rise being discon-
certing patane imagined he was un-
observed and had but two steps to go
when one of the gunfighters colts
roared at him over happy hoofs shoul-
der the dying bad man as he dropped
face first struck the scrambling happy
hoofs with his out-thrown hands which
so startled the paint that she jumped
snorting and heaved upright on her
feet hallock mindful of his pets
danger even in the thick of the fight
denied himself the protection her body
might have afforded while he was get-
ting up slapped her flank with a gun-
barrel which drove the animal outside
a bullet splintered the bar close
to hallocks left ear his left leg
was somewhat numb from the weight of
the horse but he planted his right foot
firmly and with back braced against the
bar slid to nearly his full height
crouched in characteristic fighting pose
lew harney and sid cobb cattle
thieves when they were working ready
gun-fanners working or loafing found
themselves in direct line with hair-
triggers leveled sixes harney al-
ready had taken one shot at the two-
gun man and missed and hallock knew
it both waddies were standing near a
poker table lew whirled like a flash
upsetting the table and jerking cobb
down as he threw himself behind it
harney was just a fraction too slow to
save himself a slug whined unerringly
from one of hallocks guns and
smashed between the rustlers eyes
harney lifted to his feet with a short
yell then fell against the barricade he
had arrayedturning the table over on
its top the legs plumb and exposing
sid cobb fanning his triggerless
colt that is striking the thumb of his
left hand against the hammer sid un-
limbered but one shot before hallock
tucked a settler in his chest and he
slid forward gasping beside his late
partner in cattle raiding
but four of hallocks enemies stood
unhurt avid in spite of the destruction
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

he had wrought and but for his torn
ear his apparently scatheless condition
to compass his defeat now or never
kill or be killed they could never get
to the door past hallocks guns in fact
none of the four entertained a thought
of escape they had reached a stage
of desperation where death can be faced
eye to eye without a conscious quiver
len roper a long-haired sun-smoked
old rawhide who had been a bad man
for forty years advanced first on the
bayed hallock tipping up hi holster to
fire through the bottom he pulled trig-
ger and so did hallock the shots roar-
ing into one knowing the deadly style
of ropers gunplay hallock had aimed
to cripple his hand and thus deflect the
bullet otherwise even with death tear-
ing at his vitals old len might have the
tenacity to send a bullet straight as his
last act on earth bellowing his pain
and rage the long-haired bad man-
who was no imitation though he did
affect the lengthy locks which were so
often an indication of the show-off a
wild-looker who couldnt stand the
acid-dangled his smashed paw then
hand that for forty years had cut down
good and bad alike according as their
politics were at variance with mr
ropers bang roared hallocks right-
hand gun in the midst of len ropers
lamentation cutting it short but len
though old proved tougher than some
of the younger ones who had gone down
earlier with a bullet lodged some-
where near his heart-hallock was cer-
tain of that-the long-hair took several
steps backward trying to steady him-
self after the shock of the lead injec-
tion his good hand flung out to aid
him in regaining his balance struck a
leg of the table overturned by messrs
harney and cobb dying on his feet
his brain seethed with one idea to re-
taliate on the man who had broken his
gun hand and given him his death
wound and the contact of his hand
with the table-leg seemed to suggest a
way unable to utter a sound but with
strength to spare for his final deed be-
cause hate buoyed him len tore the leg
loose and flourishing it has a club stag-
gered at the man crouched back to bar
i lallocks blazing eyes at that in-
	 stand were glancing over the
sights at the three other desperadoes
advancing on him as one man with
intervals of a few feet between them to
get him from in front and both sides at
once as he threw down on the gun-
packer sidling to the left len roper
piled in oblivious to the spurting gun
and took the bullet himself there was
a loud thump roper had landed a
blow with his club but not where he
aimed for almost instant death from
that second bullet shortening his reach
instead of striking hallock on the head
the table-leg smashed him on the chest
yet with sufficient force to hurl him
backward half across the bar len
roper slumped floorward unaware
that he had not achieved his end
  gasping for breath and flat on his
back with legs hanging over the edge
of the bar hallock heard a sudden rush
of feet his last three enemies were
closing in following up the advantage
given them by the late mr roper over
whose body one of them tripped-and
cursing kicked it-in his blind eager-
ness to finish the battling mr hallock
while he was down mr hallock may
have been down but he was by no
means out he raised up as two of
these desperadoes thrust guns within an
inch of his body as he was employing
one arm to lever himself upright the
gun in that hand was temporarily so to
speak spiked cannon but mr hallock
had feet and he did not let them stay
idle in this extremity the man he
could not reach with a gun he kicked
full in the face-and the face disap-
peared thrusting the other gun into

the vest of the second bad man hal-
lock tunnelled him the flame from the
muzzle setting his shirt on fire
  the third man of the trio who had
been delayed in reaching hallock by
stumbling over len roper was the first
object to loom on hallocks wavering
vision as he slid off the bar he had
forgotten that man he fired without
aiming saw him fall and the smoke
jerking from his gun-muzzle as he fell
but hallock was sure he himself had
not been hit for he felt all right except
for dizziness on the floor a man
moved accustomed to watching the
hands of men their hands and their
eyes hallock almost mechanically saw
the hand of the man lift-and mechani-
cally he shot wondering as he pressed
trigger if there was an unused cartridge
in the gun he pointed he had lost
count of shots and men the roaring
explosion and the thump of the mans
head on the floor were both vaguely sat-
isfying that man must be the last
of them thought hallock as he gazed
around seeming to look from another
world upon the shambles he had
created with his two hands lined with
iron yes he was the last the fellow he
had kicked in the face he remem-
bered now he sheathed his guns and
turned to the bar
  whisky he said in a monotonous
voice though there was nobody in sight
to take his order
  the bartender his face pasty
crawled out from under he fumbled
the bottle and glass he placed at hal-
locks hand
  nerves aint so good huh the
gunfighter sneered look here he
stretched forth his right arm the fingers
of his hand spread wide-steady as
rock
  the bartender nodded shamefaced
i aint put together that way few is
he sniffed somethin burnin
  powder suggested hallock sarcas
tically
  somethin else too the bartender
leaned over the mahogany there
he exclaimed and pointed down wes
tys shirts afire gettin cremated
  hallock glanced at the little blaze
started by the pistol he had shoved in
westys vest and whipping off his som-
brero beat it out then he poured and
downed a short whisky
  whyn hell didnt yuh warn me
about coldrion layin for me in here
hallock demanded friend o his was
yuh
  hadnt no idea he was up to nothin
trigger replied the barman i dont
think he was till he saw yuh ridin by
spoke about yuh mashin his face an
said hed get yuh for it-but that was
nothin new that crowd yuh just
cleaned up always did have it in for
yuh my god but yuh can fight
  thanks i am able to take care o
myself some its plumb lucky i didnt
need no help about all i can thank
yuh for yuh bar-swabber is keepin out

  the bar-swabber was silent hal-
lock turned to go paused at the door
and looked back theres one face in
ticular im missin on that floor-
blackfoot dixons know where hes
at
  aint seen him since last night
  hallock strode out of the front door
-into the arms of his wife
       chapter ix
       hallock kicks
tve been fightin agin declared
     the two-gun man idiotically hold-
     ing sue in close embrace
  behind her stood doc bennison so-
ber again but shabby as ever his
smile was expansive when i gave you
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

permission to fight hallock i stipu-
lated one man at a time and here you
took on half the town not to men-
tion he added the other capers your
wife has told me about
  that so doc yuh did give me or-
ders hallock loosened the hold of one
arm about sue and scratched his head
half-grinning danged if i didnt for-
get em but with a full-throated
laugh i jeel all right
  in that case said the doctor id
say we have no cause to worry but
how about that ear
  hallock put up a quick hand to the
mutilated member by golly i do re-
member gettin hit but it was so long
ago id plumb forgot coldiron did
that-but coldiron aint no more an
ill hear just as good
  come over to my office right away
and ill fix it up
  soons i corral my happy hoofs
doc say girl to sue lifting her face
which all this while had been buried in
his shirt yuh dont say nothin how
come yuh cant exactly blame me for
that fight coldiron fired at me through
the front winder an i went in after
him-an was jumped
  how many hallock interposed
bennison
  well doc i just lost count they
kept coinin so fast but both guns is
empty an i didnt sling much idle lead
replied the two-gun man then to his
wife sue they was honin to down me
an i shore thought they would-
  she stopped his mouth with her hand
why do you talk so foolishly tom
blame you i never was so sea-
hallock cut in the doctor again
i didnt think sue bra- hallock could
faint but she can did dead away
when we ran down here to see what the
cannonading meant i differed in opin-
ion with your wife i was that confi-
dent youd win through-well i said
to myself if you didnt smoke your way
out id never touch another drop of
liquor and that was a promise
  doc yuh shore mustve had confi-
dence hallock remarked quizzically
  i dont suppose said bennison
that anybody needs my attention in
there and he waved toward the bar-
room
  no hallock shook his head
then added  nless its the barkeep
yuh might prescribe him a nerve-
tonic
  that fight in the elkhorn bar was a
source of conversation in derringer
years after hard-eyed old-timers who
had survived the hectic days of the
town related hair-trigger hallocks
feat with pride and heartily cussed the
law that only allowed shooting by man
who wore badges there had been no
gunplay paralleling that of hallocks
since wild bill hickok armed with a
rifle two six-shooters and two bowie
knives shot and cut up the dreaded
mccandlas outfit single-handed in
kansas hallock did not realize that
he had made history for montana but
he did not know he had stirred up der-
ringer considerably particularly when
on entering spokane harrys honka-
tonk that night he was approached by
the frock-coated cat-footed proprietor
  evening trigger he said we
dont often have a visit from you and
while i want to make you welcome i
hope at the same time youre not look-
ing for anyone im not a cheap skate
but the fixtures in this place cost me
plenty and if any such gunplay as you
staged in the elkhorn was pulled in
here-id burst into tears spokanes
poker face relaxed in as much of a smile
as he ever permitted himself you
sure messed up the elkhorn you and
your playful friends promise me
trigger if youre aimin to start some-
thing youll drag it out in the street
first
	two-gun western novels magazine
i tallqck rolled a smoke licking
	 the flap and striking a match be-
fore replying i cant promise spo-
kane because im gettin the bad habit
o keepin my word i know i didnt
clean up all the hard guys whod like
to get me an most of em hang up in
here but i aint huntin trouble ex-
cept with one blackfoot dixon gal-
latins sidekicker hell try to play
hunk for chalks toe-up from ambush
an id just as leave see him first
  i would myself said spokane
harry dryly but trigger he hasnt
been in here tonight and spokane
lied not that he had any regard for
the hide of the quarterbreed but he
feared that a meeting between the two
would mean a repetition of the elk-
horn bar shoot-up there were several
able gunmen present he knew who
only needed someone to take the initia-
tive and they would jump hallock
added to the grudge they already toted
against him he had gunned friends of
theirs that day
  hallock though he had no cause to
doubt the honkatonk owners word-
and did not-elected to circulate in
spokanes joint for a spell as he put
it blackfoot dixon was likely to am-
ble in hallock had been on the look-
out for him all day-but not a sign
  nodding to the many who spoke to
him but avoiding conversation with
anybody hallock was spectator in turn
at the roulette wheel and the faro lay-
out and in this way passed a half hour
he took no notice of the venemous
stares of certain colt-bristling gentle-
men in the big hall though careful not
to place his back toward them he de-
cided suddenly that one of the gallery
boxes fronting the small stake would
be an ideal lookout safe from rear at-
tack and obtaining a view of every cor-
ner of the hall as well as the stage go-
ing upstairs hallock entered the first
box he came to closed the door behind
him and pulling the curtains apart sat
down at the table a waiter thrust his
head in at the door and hallock ordered
beer then turned his gaze on the
crowded floor beneath to the come-
dian in the limelight at that moment
and convulsing most of the crowd with
his jokes and antics the gunfighter paid
no attention his eyes lifting from the
vivid scene of noise and movement and
color below ranged along the boxes on
the gallery opposite-and stopped at
the third one the curtains were pulled
back a man his back toward hallock
and a familiar figure crouched against
the thin wall separating his box from
the next one which had its curtains
drawn together in an attitude of listen-
ing
  blackfoot hallock swore and
clenched his fist then spokane lied
for dixon didnt come in after me i
was watchin too close to miss him
  at the same time he thought it
strange that the quarter-breed should
have missed seeing him while he was
circulating in the crowd on the floor
the explanation as it seemed to him
must be that dixon had other business
on hand and so engrossing as to dwarf
the importance of a meeting with hal-
lock likely to be a life-and-death mat-
ter it would have been of interest to
the gunfighter to learn the nature of
that other business even if he had none
of his own to transact with mr dixon
when the waiter returned with the bot-
tled beer and glass the door of hal-
locks box stood open and he was gone
i tallqck was not many minutes
	 making his way across the
thronged hall up the stairs and along
the narrow gallery to the box in which
he had seen blackfoot dixon the door
was ajar plucking a gun from his
belt and with his thumb slipped under
the hammer he was about to jerk the
door wide when a commotion started in
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

the adjoining box scuffling bumping
panting of hard-drawn breaths and low
guttural curses these last in black foot
dixons voice not a doubt of it hal-
lock strode forward and tried the door
of the box from which the sounds of
strife emanated it was locked he
was going to call but on second thought
closed his lips jammed the muzzle of
his colt against the lock and pulled
trigger once twice the fastening was
smashed the door swung inward an inch
or two without hallock touching a fin-
ger to it the gunfighter was about to
enter pushing his gun ahead of him
and puzzled as to what it all meant
when the door was jerked wide open
and a heavy body catapulted into him
knocking him down the man ran on
down the gallery and hallock recog-
nizing the figure as blackfoot dixons
as he scrambled up reached hurriedly
for the six-shooter he had dropped
  leave it lay pardner drawled a
mans voice near at hand and hallock
looked for the first time into the box
lighted by an oil lamp the owner of
the voice was a tall lanky but broad-
shouldered young fellow with curly hair
and a not unhandsome good-natured
face he wore semi-range garb and
was training a sawed-off thirty-eight in
hallocks direction a lazy but daunt-
less blue eye back of the sight against
the wall near the young man stood a
dance-hall girl known as goldie her
dark eyes mirroring fright one white
hand at her laboring breast
  boy growled hallock as he rose
flourishing his colt in utter and con-
temptuous disregard of the young mans
order i dunno whon hell yuh are but
yuhre a damn fool for one thing if
that lil pop-gun o yuhrs should go off
an hit me anywheres id be real mad
 and he wheeled and plunged along
the gallery in pursuit of blackfoot
dixon the breed bad man was still
in sight for the gallery was long and
hallock had been detained but a min-
ute or two long enough to pick him-
self and his colt up and bare fangs at
the timorous young man hallock had
never yet shot a man in the back so he
held fire as he ran after his quarry
blackfoot threw a backward glance as
he heard the thud and jingle of hal-
locks feet above the noise was making
himself hallock wondered why he
didnt shoot back-then reasoned that
the breed must have lost his gun in the
struggle with the curly-headed young-
ster what haven blackfoot originally
had in mind unless he meant to risk
his neck by dropping from one of the
unoccupied boxes to the floor below
the gunfighter could not guess for the
stairway was in the other direction
dixon seemed to be running into a
blind gulch at the end of the gal-
lery was a window overlooking main
street and the drop was considerable
reaching the window which was open
the breed desperado slung a leg across
the sill and turned a snarl-twisted face
toward the man rushing down the gal-
lery running awkwardly on account of
his high heels to blackfoot dixon it
looked as if he was bayed
  hallock shouted gotcha injun
prom the street below came the
thumping beat of galloping hoofs
the unmistakable rattle bang and creak
of the stage-rafe seddon accom-
panied by sam brace was just getting
in from his long drive around the cuddy
paws blackfoot dixon turned his face
from hallock and looked down into the
street in a flash grasping the window-
frame to steady himself he drew up
both legs crouching on the sill hal-
lock was almost near enough to put out
a hand and touch him when blackfoot
launched his slim body into the air in a
pantherish leap hallock felt like a
man left holding the proverbial sack
he had been unprepared for the ma-
	two-gun western novels magazine
neuver not at first connecting the
breeds desperate jump with the noise
of the stagecoach subconsciously heard
above the roar of the dance-hall activi-
ties hallock was treated to a surprise
when he looked out instead of lying
below with a snapped neck or leg
blackfoot dixon was riding away on
the coach roof all asprawl just as he
had landed he gathered himself to-
gether even as hallock glimpsed him
to meet the attack of sam brace who
had risen on the seat beside seddon and
was facing backward the driver roar-
ing at his four-in-hand and sawing on
the lines brought the concord to a
standstill at an acute angle with the
leaders prancing on the board sidewalk
dixon and the saloonkeeper locked in-
stantly in a mutual grizzly hug and
lurched wildly back and forth prevent-
ing hallock from attempting a snap-
shot
  hold im sam lend a hand there
rafe yelled hallock from the win-
dow then drew in his head and retraced
his steps at speed over the gallery he
passed the box in which he had encoun-
tered the reckless youth with the short-
barreled thirty-eight the man and
goldie were still there he noticed-
goldie was cursing the fellow he
wheeled as he heard hallock going by
called something which the gunfighter
did not catch nor stop to have repeated
hallock leaped down the stairway
swinging his gun and the men and
women nearest him scattered they
had heard nothing of the set-to on the
gallery as they were making more noise
than had attended that fracas them-
selves and they thought hallock was
on the rampage and anybody likely to
stop lead he did not have to clear a
path to the front door it was cleared
for him by willing enough feet he
passed close to spokane harry whose
inward trepidation did not show in his
expressionless face
  you lied to me spokane rasped
hallock grabbing the honkatonk own-
ers arm and halting an instant i
spose yuh thought blackfoot would
get me from behind me believin what
yuh-
  i lied to keep the joint from being
messed up interrupted spokane
boldly fronting the gunfighter though
he feared death i knew dixon was
here and i tried to find him and per-
suade him to get out where is he
jumped out the front window onto
the stage replied hallock failing to
metion the queer game he had bucked
on the gallery he was forced to be-
lieve the proprietors alleged reason for
concealing the fact of dixons presence
and released him saying no fight
with yuh then and ran on as he
charged out of the front door spokane
sighed in relief and with the other hand
brushed the arm hallock had roughly
gripped
d unning toward the stage halted
down the street not far from the
honkatonk hallock was greeted by a
shout from sam brace who was sitting
on the coach roof he got away
trigger
  hallock swore luridly which
way
  i dont rightly know answered the
saloonkeeper in the tone of one who
feels his failure deeply twisted my
gun away from me hit me between the
eyes an dropped off an rafe he had
his hands full with the hosses too
bad trigger i did my best but he
was a combination o steel spring an
breased hog
  i reckon got away from me so i
cant hardly say much to yuh for lettin
him repeat wouldnt be sense to look
for him up any dark alleys-hes got
yuhr gun aint he the two-gun man
was standing by the stage now looking
up at the saloonkeeper and saw him
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

nod
  if these four-legged thunder-
bolts- rafe seddon who had the
four-in-hand well under control after a
stiff fight began to apologize
  never mind rafe said hallock
ill cut his trail agin-soon enough
likely he was so doggone nervy about
it im amost willin to say he deserved
to get away hows yuhr wheel rafe
runnin on all four huh sam i had
a dinger of a fight in yuhr place today
the old barroom is cleaned up pretty
fair now but itll wear some o the
scars long as it stands stay up there
an let rafe put yuh down at the door
as brace mightly intrigued by the
news although still groggy from the
blow delivered by the barrel of his own
six-shooter crawled jerkily back to the
drivers box intending to alight he
hank down again at hallocks words
and said
  i reckon yuhre right trigger legs
wouldnt carry me this minute see yuh
at the bar
  want a lift trigger invited sed-
don more room than yuh can use
  thanks ill walk hallock glanced
at the crowd down in front of spokane
harrys at the groups in the street
who had witnessed blackfoot dixons
spectacular leap from the second floor
of the dance hall the people began to
disperse and go about their own busi-
ness as seddon with a mighty yank got
the leaders off the boardwalk and
started in the right direction
  hallock left the street and jingled
along the sidewalk toward the elkhorn
bar his wire would be anxiously wait-
ing it was a new and thrilling and al-
together satisfying experience to have
a woman waiting for a fellow with arm
lips and soft arms and-real love then
he thought with a sharp pain of regret
of the pal who had died under his hand
pore old reckless he muttered he
shore wouldve been right in the thick
o things thats been happening whang-
in away with both hands he shore
loved to fight the red-headed cuss
he had visited the lone grave behind
the shack he and brule had occupied
for the first time that day and erected
a rule headboard talking to the man
under the sod as he worked
  engrossed in his thoughts hallock
was nearing the elkhorn when on his
right a figure grew suddenly out of the
darkness stepping around the corner
of the barber shop the light in the
shop window reached just far enough to
dimly reveal the dark indian features
of blackfoot dixon and strike a dull
plint from the long six-shooter with
which he was covering the gunfighter
  now hallock yuh die snarled
the breed
  by sams gun too aint that hell
hallock though taken by surprise had
his nerves well in hand his eyes nar-
rowed dixon had a dead drop
  yuh killed chalk they been tellin
me continued blackfoot an other
pals omine-old len an coldiron an
lew harney an them i wasnt in town
or yuhd been fightin me too glad
im livin to get revenge for em hal-
lock i hate yuhr guts if things had
broke different if i had the time id
roast yuh blackfoot style but  gotta
be satisfied killin yuh ordinary hands
to the buzzards an watch the iil
hammer rise watch er close for when
she falls yuh do i said hands up
he repeated tensely yuhre too slick
to be trusted with em down
t tallqck had been steeling him-
  self for a supreme effort he was
thankful for that light at his back dim
as it was dixon stood within reach of
hand or foot holding braces gun low
nearly on a line with his hip as if in
obedience to dixons rasping com-
mand hallocks hands shot skyward
and with the motion of lifting them he

two-gun western novels magazine
kicked upward with his right foot the
toe of his boot struck sharply the wrist
of the desperado who was scarcely ex-
pecting any movement from the region
below hallocks belts and knocked the
gun out of his hand dixon loosed a
white mans oath hallocks hands
dropped like a flash his right one to the
belt sagging on the side and coming up
with a gleam of steel
  yuhr turn to watch the hammer
blackfoot the two-gun man hissed
  dixon did not cringe his beady eyes
did not waver as he looked at the slow-
lifting hammer go ahead an shoot
an be damned hallock he said
coolly im mostly white but theres
enough blackfoot in me to make me
take medicine like an indian
  hallock swiftly sheathed his colt
stooped and recovered sams iron
which had fallen near his feet and ad-
dressed the astonished breed dixon
yuh may hate my guts as yuh say but
im admirin yuhrs yuh shore aint
afraid an how yuh come to pal around
with a yellow pup like chalk gallatin
gets me plumb but thats nothin to do
with us blackfoot its in the cards
that im to kill yuh-sometime-but
not now cant do it after the way yuh
just looked into that muzzle an not an
eye flickerin well have to meet agin
an finish it an likely im a fool for
takin a chance on another time for
yuh bein injun enough to die without
whinin are also injun enough to think
ambushin fair fightin now get the
hell out
  the hatred had not died out of
blackfoots eye for all that his enemy
had spared him as he turned and
swiftly retreated up the alley in which
he had waited for hallock to pass
  the gunfighter proceeded on his way
to the elkhorn shaking his head he
knew he was a fool for giving dixon
another opportunity to get him but
lion-hearted himself he could not break
the temporary spell of admiration for
similar courage displayed under test
by the other had chalk gallatins
backbone stiffened at the time hallock
faced him on the slope the bad cow-
boys death might have been less vio-
lent-might have been for chalk had
committed the unpardonable sin to the
primitive mind especially the elemen-
tal primitive mind of a man like hal-
lock of manhandling a woman the
woman he loved
   ill tell sue about that dixon starin
down death an paralyzin my trigger-
finger for the first time he reflected
an i wont tell nobody else
  he was but a few steps from the door
of sam braces saloon when he heard
his name called hallock-wait
the voice was somehow familiar he
swung on his heel and saw a man run-
ning toward him not until the man
came up where the light from the open
door of the elkhorn struck upon face
and figure did hallock recognize him-
and then he did so with a start he had
completely forgotten the young fellow
in the gallery-box at spokane harrys
with goldie the curly-headed young-
ster who had had the presumption to
point a sawed-off thirty-eight at hal-
lock here he was smiling brazenly
chapter x
hallock opens a door
tuh dont look a heap glad to
 see me mr hallock declared
the young fellow with a west-
ern drawl and in no tenderfoot tone as
might have been expected
  yuh want to be careful how yuh
go round pointin guns at folks replied
hallock not knowing whether to be
angry or otherwise some of em
might not take it as a joke like i did
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

studying the youth in a calmer mood
especially the eyes and the firm chin
the gunfighter decided there might be
more iron in his system than appeared
at first glance
  i wasnt meaning that as a joke
hallock stated the young fellow
boldly i made a mistake that was
all thought yuh were a friend o dix-
ons but the girl goldie told me dif-
ferent an i called to yuh as yuh ran
by the box that second time but yuh
seemed in a hurry did yuh catch
him
 who-blackfoot hes still foot-
loose now brother before we swap
any more talk ill just break a rule o
frontier etiket an ask yuh who an
what
  a deputy sheriffs badge pinned in-
side the youngsters vest gleamed in
hallocks eyes an my labels billy
edgelow sent up here by sheriff gran-
ger to look-stop he exclaimed
sharply lifting a palm in the oldtime
peace sign of the plains to halt the
downward sweep of hallocks hands
i know who yuh are hair-trigger
know yuhr record but i aint after
yuh
  hallocks suddenly tense body re-
laxed again he even smiled a little
yuhr rep as a gun-slinger aint un-
known to me either edgelow but i
hadnt no idea yuh was so young my
hats off to yuh boy yuhve made a lot
o cagey ones lay down an i notice
now yuhre packin a reglar forty-five
in a reglar belt wheres the lil thirty-
eight
  inside my vest the place it always
is when it aint workin havin that
short barreled baby tonight just about
saved my skin from what ive heard
of yuhr recent doins hallock since i
hit town includin the fact yuhve mar-
ried and he smiled engagingly i
reckon yuhve been workin in the in-
terest o law an order even if it was
personal scores yuh were settlin fr
instance yuh finished the job the main
job that brought me here in my
pocket i got a useless warrant for mr
chalk gallatin
  the hell yuh have hallock ex-
ploded i mean he corrected him-
self grimly hes in hell now an yuhr
warrant shore is useless couldnt serve
no paper there was it cause he ven-
tilated the last town marshal derringer
had that the law wanted him inquired
hallock
  for one thing yeh nodded deputy
edgelow but mainly for holdups on
the sun canyon trail yuh remember
several passengers were gunned in those
holdups
  heard so i never figgered chalk
was that lone bandit the stick-ups
stopped about six months ago didnt
they uh-huh well thats about the
time chalk drifted in here how come
yuh didnt nail him before then ques-
tioned hallock
  lost track of him several weeks
ago seth rawdon came up here to look
over the two bar ranch when he
returned to the county-seat he reported
to the sheriff that hed seen chalk in a
saloon in this town hed been a victim
in one o chalks holdups to the tune
of a thousand dollars met yuh the
same day in the same place recogniz-
ing yuh from descriptions hed heard
said yuh could do sleight-o-hand with
a gun
  i remember him hallock nodded
slowly didnt know who he was an
got suspicious he might be a deputy
found he wasnt carryin a gun an
when i told him it was tough country
out to the two bar an hed best get
heeled he gimme a lil sermon on livin
by the trigger yuh bet i remember
him-he was pretty near right names
rawdon eh came here to ask where
he could hire a hoss did he buy the
two bar
	two-gun western novels magazine
veh last week hes there now
  	an that dixon lifted-but ill
go on from the time rawdon vis-
ited granger tellin chalks where-
abouts an how tough derringer was
sheriff knew about the toughness an
had meant for sometime to put the lid
on up here as well as gun-totin hom-
bres makin this town their headquar-
ters an an honest man hardly safe in
it cow rustlers an hoss thieves was
raisin hell for the ranchers specially
the two bar which was the reason the
former owner was anxious to sell i
was away in another part o the county
when rawdon called but as soon as i
came back sheriff started me on the
trail agin i got here yesterday
stopped at the two bar to see if raw-
don had got hold of any more informa-
tion that would help me he hadnt
but he was in a terrible stew an his
punchers too every last hoof had
been rustled from the saddle-stock cor-
ral they hadnt any hosses to follow
a trail even if they could find one-
which they couldnt trail was pretty
well covered an when i tell yuh that
blackfoot dixon was one o the hoss
thieves yuhll understand why - he
used his injun tricks well i hunted
round an hunted round an i struck it
good bit luck although ive had a lotta
experience trailin an learned more
from the sheriff hes a wonder the
trail led toward derringer an as i was
cornin here anyways it suited me fine
sighted the stolen hosses soon an the
thieves two of em was careful not
to let em see me though they took
the hosses to a coulee about a mile
south o this town a place where two
men could stand off twenty easy count
o the boulders around it i didnt
tackle it one o the thieves when i
got near enough i recognized as black-
foot dixon mebbe yuh dont know it
but blackfoots wanted about as bad as
chalk was - year ago or more he
roasted two placer miners at the stake
an stole their dust on cougar creek
  that so well he expressed a heap
o sorrow he wasnt in no position to
give me a similar treat tickles the
injun spots in him roastin hallock
thought with a twinge of the manner
of gallatins deceasement and shut up
abruptly
  the deputy picked up the narrative
while i was watchin the coulee from
a distance blackfoot rode off leavin
his hoss stealin pardner with the broncs
he headed for derringer an i trailed
after it was gettin dark when we
got here i saw him dodge into that
honkytonk trailed in but couldnt see
nothin of im so i hung around
waitin for him to show up he mustve
spotted me while i was waitin shore
he didnt see me when i was trackin
him from the coulee as my badge was
hid like it is now an i hadnt no idea
blackfoot nor anybody in there knew
me by sight never havin been up this
way before i wasnt none cautious
about paradin dance-hall girl the one
yuh saw me with come up an asked
me to buy her a drink not suspectin
there was any plot afoot an not wantin
to make any more enemies than neces-
sary i treated then she suggested
that we take a box an watch the show
an have more drinks well she was
kinda goodlookin but i dont care
much for her kind an i wasnt on no
pleasure trip but it struck me that shed
know about gallatin an likely could
gimme a lotta useful information-if
she would id try her i did i
didnt drink much though she coaxed
me makin me some suspicious an she
didnt drink much which made me
more suspicious couldnt guess her
game though for she answered all my
casual-like questions in a way i couldnt
disbelieve told me yuhd killed chalk
after hed run off with the girl yuhre
now married to an about yuh downin
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

eight-ten hard ones in the elkhorn by
yuhr lonesome she didnt know where
blackfoot was she said when i asked
-an thats where she lied i know
now he was listenin in the next box
waitin for her signal
  i was lookin for him same time yuh
was edgelow an saw him with his ears
to the wall from a box across the hall
i went right over
itnow what that girl goldies game
was seein i wasnt goin to get
drunk she pulled the curtains shut an
come an set on my knees an started
to get mushy im-well im human
an i aint an old man an she was
pretty an soft like i say-soft on top
she was but hard underneath that
skirt while i was kissin her both arms
around her slid one hand down an
lifted my colt i felt it leavin the hol-
ster tried to grab her arm but she
jumps up an backward holdin it an
calls blackfoot  sharp in he jumps
gun in his fist lockin the door quick
i made a dive for him as he turned from
turnin the key we clinched in a
mighty lovin clinch an i tore the gun
away from him throwin it under the
table goldie ill say that for her
didnt try to help him in the fight an
she couldve easy mebbe she was
sorry shed helped a breed agin her own
race i dunno well we rassled all over
that lil box yuh betche an i was aim-
in to get at that reserve thirty-eight in-
side my vest the breed from bein
pressed so close to me had felt it knew
what i was tryin to do an tried to pre-
vent it just about then yuh blowed
the lock off the door dixon mebbe
thought it was a good chance to escape
or that somebody was gettin in to help
me-i figgered it was somebody cornin
to help him anyways he jerked himself
loose as yuh smashed the lock an stam-
peded right over yuh as yuh know even
better than i do got my thirty-eight
out but he was gone before i could
fire then i lined yuh-an yuh walked
off i reckon yuhre wiser now than yuh
was before eh hallock
  keno how come yuh stayed in
the box when i ran after blackfoot
why goldie told me who yuh was
-an shed told me before that in
speakin o gallatin that yuh an dixon
was deadly enemies so i figured if any-
body could corral blackfoot yuh could
an then i had a few gentle words to
pour in the ladys ear appertainin to her
part in the game to colddeck me when
i told her she was liable to arrest did
she wilt like hell she called me
some names i aint never heard before
an i thought id been dry behind the
ears long enough to know em all
course i didnt intend to arrest her-
i pity the pore devils-but i reckoned
to throw a scare into her an keep her
from tryin the game on somebody else
but she didnt scare an inch sorry
blackfoot got away he added when
i went down to the street i heard some
talk about him tryin to slope on the
stage i looked for yuh knowin yuhd
know more about it than anybody an
final i saw yuh walkin along here
hallock nodded the injuns a
devil-darin cuss jumped out the win-
der o spokanes place onto the roof o
the stage as it was passin by my
father-in-law tried to hold him but
couldnt an he beat it somewheres
the gunfighter did not speak of the
second meeting with blackfoot he
stood thoughtfully a moment or two the
deputy imitating him blackfoots
hoss gone from the hitchrack in front
o spokanes that bein so mebbe
hes rode out to join his pardner in that
coulee i know where it is an what its
like-as yuh say a pretty good fort
but they wont be stayin there long i
reckon though before yuh come there
wasnt any law hereabouts to bother
em none aimin to drive em up to
	two-gun western novels magazine
the border an across into canada
dontcha reckon
  yeh said edgelow take a sharp
guy to get em by the mounties but
blackfoots sharp enough even if the
other fellow aint
  yuh want i should ride with yuh
edgelow an help get the two bar
hosses back if theres a way to do it
well find the way
  the efficient deputy clapped a hand
on his shoulder hallock ive been
hopin yuhd offer yuhr help ready to
go
ii alloc k glanced toward the open
  a saloon door yeh he said sud-
denly ill see my wife after we come
back know where the sundown stage
station is yuh mustve rode past-
righto meet yuh at the corrals my
hoss is there
  ten minutes later they were riding
south on the moonlit plain deputy
sheriff edgelow had been talking ever
since they threw the town behind
       an the reward money for
chalk dead or alive is yuhrs o course
one thousand offered by the county
another thousand by wells fargo ill
have the sheriff send yuh a check soons
i get back
  well said hallock i aint yet
reached the stage where ill turn down
cold cash in fact im needin it more
now than i ever did
  shore yuh are though i cant say
from experience not bein hitched an
thats all the more reason hallock why
you should consider serious that pro-
position to swear yuh in as a deputy o
grangers he wants yuh man said he
didnt believe yuh was half as black as
painted-
  i was though interrupted the two-
gun man severely honest till the girl
whos my wife took me in hand pretty
wild yes edgelow but shes goin to
gentle me to the bridle in time yuh
  see i dont like the deputy idea cause
itll mean ive got to keep on packin
guns-an since i killed a pal by mis-
take- he paused and coughed to re-
lieve the sudden tightness in his throat
at the recollection of old reckless lying
in his grave
  i know about that goldie told
me the deputys tone was sympa-
thetic
  goldie said hallock in a minute
or two shore mustve poured her
brains out of her mouth well then
yuh know my reasons for wantin to
discard guns im married an-the
other thing
  yeh nodded the deputy yet was
undeterred but hallock yuhr repu-
tation is big enough for yuh to rest on
it blackfoot dixon i reckon is about
the last of yuhr real haters an well
mebbe get him tonight it aint likely
that many will want a run-in with yuh
knowin what mean lead yuh serve
why hallock id be willin to bet any-
thing almost that yuh wont have to
pull a gun half a dozen times while
yuhre in office the bad men rustlers
an all of em will take a sneak out o
yuhr part o missoula county-it
wouldnt surprise me an if yuh do
have to shoot why itll be in the name
o the law
  wearin a nickel badge an killin a
man dont make no difference in the fact
that yuhve killed him observed hal-
lock with a logic that stunned but did
not convince the younger man not
that im gettin ree-ligious added the
gunfighter with a short laugh though
ive lately scrambled acquaintance with
a preacher who rings the bell
  yuh aint got any other job in mind
have yuh young edgelow asked
feeling that here was a clincher
  no said hallock an its that
fact only that keeps me from turnin
yuhr deputy sheriffin offer down flat
but all i know is how to play opry on
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

colonel colts harp-distributers an i
got a wife to support ill se what she
says edgelow an of its yes yuh can
pin yuhr shiny badge on-
 the thutting crack of a -
finished for him the bullet plunked
in the hard ground in front of them
ahead lay the rockgrit coulee at once
hallock swung down and backed
happy hoofs well out of range leaving
her standing with the reins hanging
  thats about as far as that win-
chesterll throw em-where the bullet
hit remarked hallock expertly judg-
ing the distance to the coulee but
bring yuhr hoss here alongside mine
an hell shore be safe
  hoss thiefs got the edge on us
grumbled the deputy as he followed
hallocks advice i never thought to
bring a rifle
  nor me said hallock but even if
we had one i dont reckon itd be much
good fellers forted fine an he wont
expose enough o himself for us to nick
-not in this moon light daylight
mebbe wonder if its blackfoot-
though i never seen him handle any-
thing but six-shooters-or the unknown
guy by his lonesome seein two ridin
toward him he knew even as far as we
are from his fort that we wasnt
friends if either one of us now-but
mebbe black foots joined him aready
hes had time enough
they squatted on their heels in
 silence the winchester in the
coulee was also silent
  say hallock exclaimed suddenly
i think i savvy how to get him ill
keep him busy in front here-or both
of em whichever it is-an yuh crawl
around to the other side o the coulee
an get em in the flank how are yuh
on snake imitatin
  good at snakin replied deputy
edgelow without boast id thought
o rear-attackin myself but weve been
  seen they know theres two of us an if
one goes hell be missed
  dont yuh believe it boy smiled
hallock who could not forget edge-
lows youthful appearance though
there was not five years difference in
their ages ill make em think were
both here on this spot an anxious to
waste lead yuh recollect the old-time
scout trick o shiftin base with each
shot and at edgelows quick nod he
finished well start crawlin an ill
start shootin
  hallock stretched himself on his
stomach in the bunch-grass a gun in
each fist he fired with the right-hand
weapon aiming in the direction of the
coulee though for all the damage it
would do he might just as well have
fired straight up in the air the win-
chester replied to the roar of the colt
the lead thumping two or three yards
away hallock rolled over rolled sev-
eral feet and he did it so quickly that
the detonation of the first shot had not
died before it was caught up and pro-
longed by the throbbing boom of a
second belching from the left-hand
gun meanwhile belly to the ground
deputy billy edgelow was hitching his
long slim body with painful slowness
but steady progress over the sea of
bunch-grass describing a wide semi-
circle he could have wished for a
moonless night for such work and
blessed every cloud which for a mo-
ment or two or longer swam across the
face of the beaming satellite
  the gun fighter stuck to his guns
literally for over a half hour he fired
and rolled fired and rolled left to right
and back again giving as good as imita-
tion of two men shooting from different
positions a few feet apart as two men
could have done his cartridge belts
were getting lighter he was glad he
had two to keep up the bombardment
young edgelow was a long time mak-
ing the trip to the coulee but of course

two-gun western novels magazine
he had to be careful
  that buckaroo soliloquized hal-
lock as time ran on certain there was
but one man coupla lulus slingin away
all this good lead he aint so strong
on brains himself he remarked on
second thought tryin to make that
rifle carry the few extra yards it wont
reach hes dumber than i am i
reckon cause i dont expect to get no-
wheres if that angel-face deputy-
  the distant rumbling of a colt in the
direction whence heretofore had
sounded only the staccato voice of the
winchester then silence hallock
leaped up whooping jammed his smok-
ing guns in their scabbards and ran to
the horses hair-pinning the paint
mare and with the reins of the deputys
mount bunched in his left hand he
scudded across the plain as he gal-
loped within hail of the coulee the tall
lanky form of billy edgelow appeared
in the moonlight running along the rim
and waving triumphant arms
  got him he yelled to hallock
one man but it wasnt blackfoot all
the two bar hosses is down there
twenty-five or thirty of em
wirs tom hallock said yes
in the matter of her husband
wearing a deputy sheriffs badge for
seventy-five dollar a month thereby
astonishing billy edgelow whose hopes
had gone a-glimmering when hallock
left the decision up to his wife edge-
low thought he knew something about
women-and maybe he did something
-but he had never before met the kind
of a woman sue hallock was sues
reason for giving her consent were her
own she knew you couldnt cure a
drunkard by cutting off his liquor sup-
ply all at once-you had to diminish
it gradually her husband was in simi-
lar case and would require similar
treatment his killing impulse couldnt
be uprooted suddenly but must be
weeded by degrees the responsibili-
ties of the deputys office would teach
him self-control
  hallock having sold the horse and
effects of his late partner brule turned
up at the northern pacific depot one
morning the day after billy edgelow
departed for the county-seat and
ordered two tickets to deadwood
  aint leaving us are you hallock
the agent asked arching his brows i
thought you were going to be a deputy
sheriff around these parts
  am nodded hallock smiling
dont lose no time gettin around
news dont but im goin on my
honeymoon first be gone about two
weeks an when i come back the sheriff
will be up here to swear me in aint
seen deadwood he added reminis-
cently since i was pretty much of a
kid got my bad start there but ive
a hankerin to see the place agin
specially jerry lewiss saloon where i
used to serve drinks to wild bill hickok
an calamity jane too
  will be interesting said the agent
who did not seem at all interested in
what hallock was saying but in some
thought of his own say he spoke
abruptly and leaned in the ticket win-
dow close to the gunfighter have you
been talking around about this trip to
deadwood
well i havent hollered it from any
roofs but its been no secret why
you never found blackfoot dixon
no aint laid eyes on him since the
night he jumped out the honkytonk
winder i suspect hes hidin close to
town an his friends whats left of em
uh-huh this may be a good tip
or not hallock but pat brand-used
to be a friend of len ropers and none
of yours-was here yesterday and
bought three sections to deadwood on
the same train youre taking what do
you think of that maybe blackfoots
one of the six
when a texas town goes gun-crazy

  mebbe he is hallocks smile did
not weaken mebbe its an exo-dus
like i heard a preacher say once the
boys dont like the idea o me deputy
sheriffin knowin ill make em behave
i reckon or mebbe his lips tighten-
ing they figger to down me on the
train when i aint lookin ill watch
sharp an thank yuh for tellin me
 i hat night when hallock and his
bride boarded the eastbound six
undesirable citizens of derringer got
on too thinking themselves un-
observed sam brace and cale hal-
pin who were at the depot to see the
couple off did not remark then nor
did sue but hallock did for he was
watching and noted that they climbed
into the smoker he smiled grimly
he had kept the agents information to
himself
  i reckon ill take a smoke while our
bunks is bein made up sue hallock
remarked about an hour later as they
were roaring across the bunch-grass
plains sue suspected nothing though
she had wondered a bit why he wore
his guns as usual under his coat
  hallock made his way to the smoker
the instant he entered the car a shot
rang out from the other end it was so
unexpected that he could have done
nothing voluntarily to save himself
but as the gun spouted the train tore
round a curve jerking hallock off his
feet he went almost to his knees then
straightened and sweeping back his
coat and pulling his guns in two flash-
ing motions he covered the locality of
his half dozen enemies in seats close
together blackfoot was the one who
had fired he was kneeling on a seat
facing hallock his gun arm resting on
the back of it striding down the aisle
six-shooters leveled hallock called to
the other disturbed passengers
  this aint a holdup friends just
hold yuhr seats an duck yuhr nuts
lay plumb low theres six gents in
this car that wants to get off an im
invitin em to step into the aisle and
mosey out to the platform before lead
starts singin blackfoot yuh can keep
that gun-but not in yuhr hand
  blackfoot holstered it caught un-
der hallocks drop the six gunmen
stepped into the aisle as directed and
filed to the vestibule hallock thrust
one gun in its scabbard closed behind
them the door into the car then pushed
by pat brand and blackfoot and the
rest and opened the vestibule door
  one at a time gents purred hal-
lock its take a chance or stand an
take it
  pat brand first in line sprang out
as hallocks gun prodded him they
heard no sound but the roaring of the
train blackfoot dixon next cursed
the gunfighter savagely-in the white
tongue-and hurled himself outward
to be engulfed by the darkness an-
other man leaped a scream floated
back to the men on the platform three
waiting apprehensively to follow the
man who had cried out the fourth in
merciless mood again inexorable as
the last man jumped hallock slammed
shut the vestibule door sheathed his
other gun and re-entered the smoker
  some passengers just got off he
said when he stood beside his wife
  but-we didnt stop at any sta-
tion her eyes widened in surprise
  they choosed just the same to get
off persisted hallock blackfoot
dixon an pat brand an friends six
of em
  oh comprehension filled her fine
eyes she detected now the dying red
flicker in his she put a hand on his
shoulder tom do you realize this is
our honymoon
  and hallock unable to fathom her
expression wondered if she were re-
proving him he unbuckled his gun
belts one after the other

w h b kent
    beyond the brimstone border these two hard-bitten badmen could
    test their deadly gunswift against ranger john stark the human
colt-arsenal from arizona
the girl stared speechless horrified
lean dark hawk-faced john stark
of the rangers arizona terri-
tory sat on the counter of the
sacatone trading company sacatone
city he rolled the rowels of his
straight shanked spurs up and down
the boards below and reached into the
sugar barrel for a lump of brown sugar
the sugar disappeared into a wide
thin-lipped mouth and he cocked a dark
eye at his friend the clerk well
fat he asked what you been doing
the clerk short fat and intensely
serious answered john i been think-
ing
  stark brought up another lump of
sugar and told the clerk that wont
get you nowhere fat
the clerk stopped to look over his
glasses suspiciously he asked what
no manbreakers wanted

wont get me nowheres
  stark said thinking
  the clerk said hump in an ex-
asperated voice
  then stark said dont tell me they
bought cartridges canteens and canned
tomatoes
  the clerk stopped wandering around
and looked at the ranger he asked
they who then he added
thoughtfully there was only one of
them
  there was a lightning gleam in the
rangers eyes he asked stranger
slim middle height light eye-
brows
  the clerk looked surprised and
asked howd you know
  stark said i didnt know i was
just hoping then he asked you
didnt see the horse
  the clerk answered regretfully
no i didnt john then he said
but he bought two canteens and
enough stuff for two
  stark nodded to that guess hes
what im looking for they robbed the
bank in tucson three of them they
shot the cashier but somebody got one
of them as they was getting out of town
i lost them up in the foothills in the
dark and thought id make a try for
here one of em was wounded
  the fat clerks eyes had opened wide
as he asked you dont say and shot
the cashier how much did they get
away with
  stark said i didnt wait to find out
then he asked how long ago and
which way did he head
  fat told him early this morning
and he pulled out for the river he
spoke thoughtfully canteens and
tomatoes and theres water between
here and the mexican border he
thrust a fat finger at the ranger and
pronounced theyre heading for the
desert first
  stark nodded to that and slid off the
counter he said get me some to-
matoes fat
  the clerk nodded and walked around
behind the counter muttering my
my and shot the cashier
  the ranger spoke seriously just
the same fat some of these ginks you
tip off to me are going to get wise some-
day and then wherell you be
  fat said hump me in a vindic-
tive voice reached under the counter
and brought out a double barreled
sawed off shot gun he said take a
look
stark spoke in mock seriousness
but dont put the butt against
your stomach fat when you let fly both
barrels
  the clerk ignored that to suddenly
shout but my my i forgot listen
john old turkey tracks that old pros-
pector and his granddaughter they
left for the desert yesterday was go-
ing to fill their burro kegs at the river
and hit the desert last night
  the rangers quizzical eyes sobered
he shook his head muttering softly
that cooks it theyre two tough
hombres bad ones
  he started for the door throwing
over his shoulder adois fat ill
come and tell you about it
  the clerk spoke comfortably sure
you will
  john stark of the rangers pushed
open the screen door and his slitted
eyes fought the searing glare of the
sun of southern arizona a great bay
horse at the hitch rail lifted a splendid
head to look at him and nickered
softly
  the horse walked along the one dusty
street of sacatone city tossing his
head rolling the curb wheel over his
tongue men dragging spurs along the
uneven board walk looked at the big
bay horse and the hawk-faced ranger
some waved calling out jovially hi

two-gun western novels magazine
john others whispered to each other
who the hells he after now
  they went past the cool caverns of
the livery barn turned to the left and
rode up a long slope short grey green
live oaks stood around in the short
brown grass up to the right the
tumbled foothills of the cholla range
rose up to be the gaunt ribs of the
great peak of the chollas far up
blackish juniper bushes ran up into
the pinon belt and then the black band
of the pines was drawn like a shawl
around the throat of the ancient fire
tortured peak
  stark talked to the horse softly
this will be four times we chased
somebody out into that damn desert
mebbeso our luck will hold
  a little later he spoke again weve
known old turkey tracks for years
but i dont savvy the granddaughter
but mebbeso we did hear about a
daughter tucked away somewhere
the big bay flicked his little pointed
ears and stepped out briskly
  they came to the crest of the long
slope and looked down on the mesquite
flats of the rio sacatone and over a thin
string of green leaved walnuts to the
desert for mile on mile the desert
rolled away to the horizon red and
brown with leperous white patches of
alholi the heat waves shimmered and
shifted and the desert seemed to roll
and heave like some treacherous re-
pulsive sea away off at the end of
the world a blue line lay between desert
and sky the faraway hills stark
was thinking little water only
enough for a few head of horses
  the horse went on down the tuscon
road into the mesquite flats along the
river every footfall lifted little balls
of white dust that hung in the air they
turned off the road into a trail that
wound around through the mesquite
and catclaw and over to the river
  there was water there a shallow
stream that sparkled in the sunlight
across the river stark slid off the horse
and began to hunt signs he quickly
found the place where turkey tracks
the old prospector had stopped for
awhile the mark of the water kegs
was plain where they had been filled
four burros he told himself and fol-
lowed the trail a little way old tur-
key tracks on foot and the girl riding
the old fool dragging his grand-
daughter into the desert then he
grinned and thought if she looks like
old turkey tracks she might as well
be in the desert as anywhere
  he came back to the river bank and
began casting about for the tracks of
two horses he thought i know these
horse tracks followed them far enough
to it was sometime before he found
where two horses had come out of the
river his lean dark face lightened
with pleasure then darkened in disap-
pointment they were not the same
horses
  he thought they could have got
fresh horses out of the an pasture
after a little he shook his head mut-
tering but ive got to be sure
  he found where a man had squatted
on his heels by the river perhaps to
fill canteens he followed that back
into the brush there he found what
he wanted
  in the dust under a mesquite bush
was the clear print of the back of a
man a man had laid there at full
length on his back waiting for the
man at the river what brought the
gleam of delight to starks eyes was that
the mans left hand rear pocket had
been half torn down the mask of
the torn pocket was quite clear
stark walked briskly back to the
big bay thats him he told the
horse thats the wounded one i
saw that torn pocket in the dirt yes-
terday afternoon
no manbreakers wanted

  stark slid up unto the horse rode
up out of the brush through a thicket
of ocatilla cactus and the desert was
before him he was thinking they
havent water enough to reach the far-
away hills neither have i but mebbeso
they dont know it old turkey tracks
has enough though
 then he thought of the grand-
daughter out there on the desert-and
those two waterless killers coming on
her with slitted eyes the manhunter
rode out onto the desert
  out in the desert two men riding
westward hard-eyed men with mean
tight mouth a heavy-set man with
a weeks beard on a beefy face rode
tilted over in the saddle he had
rigged a rope sling that ran from the
saddle horn down under his left knee
holding it up he held to the saddle
horn with both hands his face was
drawn with pain
  the other was younger slim with
light hair and eyes his eyebrows were
so light as to be unnoticeable giving
the light eyes a curiously snakelike
look a bundle in a grain sack was
tied securely behind the saddle
  the heavy one felt gingerly of his
wounded leg cursed and complained
im thinking wed a done better to
have hit it for the border this aint
no good
  the younger one snarled and cursed
oh lay off me this is the way we
planned it aint it that damned
ranger has hightailed it for the border
we figured that all out didnt we
the wounded man grumbled again
whatd you want to beef that cashier
for slim thatl get us in trouble yet
slim cursed and pulled up his horse
to stare with mad unblinking eyes
will you shut your yawp or will i
shut it for you
  the wounded man groaned and tried
to ease his leg after a little he said
what say we take a little water
  slim yelled at him no i done told
you we aint drinking till night and
damn little then
  the wounded man mopped his dirty
sweaty pain drawn face and mumbled
something then he looked back over
his shoulder
  when slim saw the wounded man
look back over his shoulder he too
looked back
  the wounded man mumbled do
you reckon we ditched that damn
ranger
  slim said sure but there was no
conviction in his voice
  they plodded on into desert the
sun dropped lower and lower ahead of
them sending its searing heat into their
red faces they rode up short rocky
slopes and down the other side they
rode around clumps of ocatills and
pickly pear and past the whitish groups
of the poisonous cholla red lizards
ran on hot red rocks and stared at them
from beady little eyes they skirted
while alholi sinks and the white dust
burned cracked lips and their red in-
flamed eyes were painful
  the horses traveled with lowered
listless heads black streaks of wet
sweat ran down from under the saddle
blankets
  the wounded man grumbled again
his mouth twisting with pain by gawd
this leg hurts then he said if you
hadnt acted like a crazy fool and gone
to shooting wed a got twice what we
did and we wouldnt a lost joe and i
wouldnt a got this leg
  slim snarled go on go on
keep yawping
  suddenly the wounded man pulled
up his horse his voice was hoarse as
he shouted by gawd i cant stand it
i gotta have water and im going to
he unslung the canteen from his sad-
dle horn held it up by his ear and
shook it he said gawd an began
to drink he drank thirstily deeply

two-gun western novels magazine
drew a great sigh of relief and drank
again
  slim had quit shouting he hissed
at him now go on go on go on
and drink it up then see what hap-
pens to you he eyed the wounded
man hating him telling him and if
you think you gets a whack at my can-
teen youre a damn fool
  the wounded man held the empty
canteen to his ear and shook it he
turned it up to his mouth again waiting
to see if more water ran out con-
vinced it was empty he took it away
from cracked lips and looked around
he saw only the empty desert and a
hot red sun sinking in the horizon his
bloodshot eyes came back to slim his
eyes came away from slims glaring
eyes quickly and slid down to the
canteen hanging on slims saddle he
muttered im wounded and im
going to need water
  slim snarled at him jeering sure
youre going to need water and try
and get it
 i hey kicked up their listless horses
- and plodded on into the sunset
from time to time they looked back
over their shoulders they rode down
a rocky slope and crossed a wide sandy
wash the wounded man said theres
been water here sometime
  slim said yeah mebbeso year be-
fore last and mebbeso year after next

  the wounded one muttered damn

  they started up the farther slope and
the wounded one said you ride ahead
slim my horsell travel easier if you

  slim snarled me ride ahead of you
and get shot in the back
  the other man said aw now slim
whats the good of talking that way

slim said its you thats in the fix
i aint in no fix
  the wounded one said well damn
you
  they went over the crest into the
sun and slim half yelled look
the wounded one crowded his horse
up close to look down at a string of
burro tracks
  slim said burros he rode along
the trail peering intently four
burros he said fresh a little
later he pronounced and a man on
foot some old desert rat of a pros-
pector
  the two men looked at each other
delight and hope growing in bloodshot
eyes the wounded one half whispered
therell be water on them burros
slim said surest thing you know
without another word they started
trailing the burros even the horses
seemed to have taken heart from some-
thing on occasional level stretches
they trotted
  the wounded man asked how far
you think he is ahead of us slim
slim said cant be far them is
fresh tracks and burros travel slow
they kicked at their horses and got a
little speed out of them
  just under the crest of a ridge they
went slowly edging up to the top
slowly looking ahead intently the
sun had dropped into the head haze and
seemed to hang here blood red enorm-
ous
  the wounded one cursed the sun
bitterly for being there blinding their
eyes to what they hoped to see up on
the ridge they sat their horses and
peered from hand shaded eyes into the
sunset searching the desert looking
for a little string of four plodding
burros
slim said we better ride follow
the trail long as we can see afore dark
the other nodded and turned his
head to look back to the east relieved
at turning his smarting eyes away from
no manbreakers wanted

the sun he started to turn his eyes
away and then held them staring out
over the back trail a long time
  slim snarled whats eating you
come on
  the other muttered i seen some-
thing he kept on staring and then
spoke more firmly there tis
  slim brought his horse up to the
other asking impatiently wheres
what
  the other pointed a dirty finger
see he said jest below that little
red mesa cant you see it moving
now its gone wait
  slim spoke impatiently oh hell
come on youre seeing things
  the other pointed again his voice
animated there look quick you
got him against that white ledge
slim looked a long time then un-
der his breath he said i git it its a
man horseback
  the other spoke their common
thought it couldnt be that damn
ranger
  slim said hell no we didnt come
that way we came from off to the
left that man aint trailing us
moren likely hes somebody like us
on the dodge
  the other said yes we did too
thats jest the way we come
  they looked at each other then the
wounded one said that damned
ranger is on our trail
  they turned their horses then to fol-
low the burro trail slim said we
gotta get that desert rats water with
plenty a water we can lay out and am-
bush that damn ranger with him
gone and plenty water we are sitting
pretty
  the wounded one pleaded now
were going to have water slim give
me a mite of yourn
  slim snarled at him no we aint
got that water yet and i aint aiming to
take no chances he kicked up his
horse spurring him cruelly carefully
looking back to watch the wounded one
snarling at him hit some life in that
plug cant you going to be dark di-
rectly
  on another ridge they looked back
again into the dusky twilight shadows
the blood red sun after seeming to
hang a long time stationary above the
horizon had dropped beyond the dim
line of the faraway hills the long
black shadows of sunset went out too
and a grey silent dusky lay over the
desolate land
  the wounded one said mebbe hell
lose our trail in the night
  slim spurred his horse again sav-
agely snarling come on damn that
ranger he wont lose nothing-cept
his life
  i wo hours after sunrise old turkey
a tracks and his granddaughter made
camp a ledge of red sandstone
promised shade for all day the little
white haired old prospector stumped
around busily unpacking four mouse
colored burros he placed two water
kegs carefully in the shade talking
more to himself than to the girl hell
now ann he said which kag did we
use of last gotta keep em even
the girl smiled saying cant you
talk at all granddad without saying
hell
  the old desert rat answered quite
seriously hell yes
  the girl threw up her lovely head
and laughed the old man looked at
her for a minute then chuckled
  the girl was dressed in blue jeans
and heavy shoes a blue jean jumper
covered a flannel shirt she swept off
a wide brimmed black hat and the
desert sun warmed her hair to spun
copper she busied herself unsaddling
her saddle burro then walked around
after wood she came back with an
armful of dead ocatilla stalks remark-

two-gun western novels magazine
ing those hills look just as far away
as ever
  the old desert rat chuckled hell
yes he said thats the way it is
in the desert but well pull out late
this afternoon and well be in them
faraway hills come noon tomorrow
  he went on you throw some grub
together ann while i look after the
burros as he walked away he stopped
and told her you can have all the
water you want now ann plenty to
last us through from here hell yes
  the girl made a fire and fixed bacon
and coffee and biscuits in a dutch oven
when it was ready she rested it began
to seem a long time that the old man
had gone she put the breakfast close
to dying fire and walked around to the
end of the red ledge the sun struck
her a hot blow
  the four mouse-colored burros stood
half on a little hillside completely in-
different to the world they were so
used to she called out granddad
  there was not even an echo her
voice seemed to fall flat dead as if
she had never spoken suddenly she
realized the vastness the desolation
the loneliness of the desert she
walked hurriedly back to the little bed
of white ashes after a moment of
uncertainty she pulled her grand-
fathers short - winchester from
the scabboard on her saddle and stood
it up against a rock then she smiled
saying stupid hell be here in a
minute
  she stood listening intently then
she heard a rock roll and smiled with
relief she laid out tin plates and cups
and heard more rocks roll she heard
horses but had no time to sort out the
noises
  a horse snorted and she whirled
wide eyed to see a man on a horse
the mans lips were cracked and his
bloodshot eyes were fastened on the
water kegs he croaked gawd
  he began to climb off the half dead
horse looking at the girl without seeing
her he croaked water damn you
water
  the girl continued to stare horrified
then her face flushed with quick sym-
pathy she said yes yes theres
plenty of water she picked up a
small pail and filled it hurriedly from
a keg but not too much she
warned
  the girl watched the man drink
drink avidly drunkenly tipping the
little pail higher and higher the water
ran around his mouth and down over
his chin she took hold of the pail
warning him thats enough wait
a while
  the man took the pail from his
mouth his light eyes went insane with
rage and he struck the girl savagely
then he put the pail back to his mouth
  the girl stood back her face an
angry red she put her hand up to her
cheek where she had been struck and
her blue eyes turned purple then
she thought the poor man hes
crazy
  another horse came on stumbling
feet and a heavy set man with his leg
tied to the saddle horn was struggling
with the rope he slid off the horse
his wounded leg collasped and he fell
at full length
  he got painfully to his hands and
knees staring bleary eyed up at the
man drinking he croaked give me
that water slinj then he began
fumbling for his six-shooter and pointed
it unsteadily at slim
  slim took the empty pail from his
face and drew a deep breath he looked
at the man on the ground yelled
you would would you and kicked
the mans six-shooter from his hand
then he brutally kicked the poor man
in the face
  slim held the pail out to the girl
ordering her fill it
no manbreakers wanted

 i he girl pale-faced looked at slim
with growing fear and loathing she
filled the pail again ignoring slim and
walked over to the man on the ground
she helped him to his knees and then
held the pail to his gasping lips after
a long drink she took it away and the
man reached for it roughly he pulled
it away from the girl spilling half of
it and began drinking again in great
gasping gulps
  the girl picked up the six-shooter
the heavy colt gave her assurance
slim looked at her with a crooked grin
then his eyes began to take her in
he noticed the long legs the swelling
breasts under the blue jumper he
leered at her asking whered you
come into this
  the girl faced him my grand-
father will be here in a minute
  slim leered at her asking will he
the girl was suddenly filled with in-
tolerable fear the mans voice carried
an assurance that her grandfather
would not come back would never come
back
  slim stepped over to the wounded
man and yanked the pail away he
held it out to the girl ordering her
fill it
  the girl said i wont and lifted
the pistol like a flash slim was on
her wrenching the gun from her hand
twisting her arms up behind her back
until she gasped with pain then
yanked her back to his horse undid the
rope and tied her hands tripped her up
and tied her feet
  she set up and heard the wounded
one say i seen him back there did
you plug him
  slim answered casually naw i
slugged him but hell croak out there
in the sun
  the girl struggled with her faintness
and horror
  they watered their horses and had
to fight them brutally to keep them
from drinking themselves to death
they looked at the breakfast waiting
by the bed of ashes slim said well
have a big feed afterward we got to
git busy now
  the wounded one hobbled around
groaning he said that water done
me a lot of good it aint so bad
then he asked what we going to do
with the gal
  slim answered we aint going to
do nothing he snarled the gal
goes with me
  the other man half closed his blood-
shot eyes asking yeah
  slim said yeah
  slim dropped that to say i ought
to ave dragged that old rat off our
trail now well have to go out beyond
him to waylay that damn ranger if
hes still looking for us they moved
over to their horses
  the girl heard them and a great hope
came to her she heard them say
ranger and that they were going to
waylay the ranger and kill him she
closed her eyes and prayed for the
ranger
  a rock rolled and like a flash the
men were behind their horses six-
shooters ready snarling like trapped
coyotes
  the girl opened her eyes and saw
her grandfather coming around the end
of the ledge coming on stumbling feet
groping in the hot sunlight his white
hair was black with dried blood he
was mumbling ann ann annie
girl
  the wounded robber sniggered
well look whos here we got com-
pany aint we then he snarled
thought you croaked him this time
well make it stick
  the girl struggled frantically with
the ropes that held her she was frantic
with fear and horror not believing that
such horrible things could really hap-
pen she yelled at the outlaws youll

two-gun western novels magazine
pay for this you let him alone you
let him alone i tell you
  the old man paid no attention to
the outlaws he hardly seemed to see
them he came struggling on his eyes
wavering around in search of the girl
he passed close to slim
  slim raised his six-shooter a crazy
light in his whitish eyes the girl
screamed and a cold voice snapped out
of the air to say drop it
  with incredible swiftness slim whirl-
ed and shot from the hip and shot
again
  the wounded one sank to one knee
shooting out from under his horse the
horse reared and jumped and came
down with both fore feet on the man
knocking him down
  slim was crouching shooting at a
tall dark hawk-faced man who came
forward with a gun in each hand
  the roar of the shots echoed against
the ledge and a little stream of sand
poured down over the edge the man
knocked flat by the horse got to his
knees again and began groping around
for his gun
 i he wild sound of the shots cleared
 old turkey tracks brain and he
grabbed up his rifle from where the girl
had left it as the wounded man re-
covered his gun and began to lift it
old turkey tracks dropped him neatly
  turkey tracks turned the rifle on
slim and then lowered it slim had
dropped his gun he stood there his
hands at his side looking profoundly
astonished as though some incredible
thing had happened to him he was
dead before he hit the ground
  old turkey tracks let out a croaked
yell dropping the rifle to grab at the
man hell he yelled its stark
john stark of the rangers
  they talked it over all day long in
the shade of the ledge old turkey
tracks with a bandage around his
white head john stark with his dark
eyes following the girl the girl with
demure eyes sometimes letting him see
her thoughts
  no old turkey tracks pro-
nounced were going on theres
water enough to git us to the faraway
hills and git you back to the sacatone
hell ive got something good this
time he boasted
  the ranger and the girl looked at
each other and smiled these old
prospectors always had something good
  they packed and saddled at sunset
to go their own ways in the cool of the
night
  john stark asked old turkey tracks
when will you be in tucson again
the old desert rat started to scratch
his head and remembered his wound
hell he said reckon well have to
come in after grub in about a month
john stark was up on the big bay
looking down at the girl he told old
turkey tracks you report at head-
quarters when you get in he kept
his eyes on the girls eyes as he said
those are orders
  old turkey tracks chuckled hell
he said why not
  the girl flushed and her eyes clung
to his she nodded her head as though
agreeing to something yet unspoken
ill see that he does she said
empty saddles mean ar
by morse chandler
 author of when a colt-loose kid hits leather etc
the kid had been an outlaw only four hours and his heart and his
gunhand hadnt had a chance to harden
the pursuit was hammering hard on his trail
the soldado mountains were
safe only for those outside the
pale of the law a kind of hole
in the wall of new mexico this
thought was uppermost in the mind of
kid mccord as standing beside his
red roan in the shelter of a rocky out-
crop he watched the covered wagon
crawl up the steep grade the team
straining valiantly in response to whip
and shout neither the outfit nor its
driver a timeworn stetson-crowned
individual had for mccord more than
passing interest what had magnetized
his attention rowelled his curiosity
was the slim girlish figure occupying
the other half of the wagon-box the
soldados haven of cattle rustler road

two-gun western novels magazine
agent and killer were no place for
women especially one with such a face
as the girl beside the old-timer had
  as the wagon reached the top of the
grade and rolled out upon the level
the old man whoa-ed loudly and let
the reins fall slack on the backs of the
sweating horses kid mccord swung
into the saddle and rode from his shel-
ter toward them
  howdy folks he greeted draw-
ing rein beside the wagon and touching
fingers to hat brim i dont want to
horn in none or tell you your business-
but aint you off the trail a mite
  as to how issued question from
the drivers full-bearded lips while he
studied sharply from under shaggy
brows the fine-figured horseman whose
cowpunch garb in such a neighborhood
meant nothing he might be a rustler
road agent anything however the
old mans scrutiny was rather satisfy-
ing particularly of the mccord level
eyes and firm mouth no hint of guile
or cruelty in either he wore but one
gun and that untied and a rawhide
riata neatly coiled in the tie-straps
he didnt look by any means deadly
and this was a domain of lawless men
  replied the kid almost unconscious
of the inspection by reason of a back-
thrown sunbonnet which disclosed
masses highly piled of corn-colored
hair why these here mountains is
hidin place for most every sheriff-
dodger in two hundred miles you
oughtve drove around em mister not
through em an better youd turn
round right quick-
  im headin the right way-into em
deep as i can gitl the drivers state-
ment surprised mccord mightily but
his vehemence was wholly convincing
  youve done somethin said the
kid that makes it necessary-
  to run from the sheriff-yep
the old mans lips smacked out the
affirmative sharply then abruptly he
interrogated aint you
  kid mccord nodded and loosened
his lips in a grim smile you betche
hangin a man
  the drivers eyebrows went up a
trifle while the girl regarded him stead-
ily her glance unfathomable to the kid
  quoth the driver thats a leetle
somethin new-mines shootin i was
servin justice young feller but the law
wouldnt look at it that way-so here
i am you call yourself-
  in the soldados answered the kid
its agin the rules to ask a man his
name-so ive heard only been here
two-three hours myself but ill tell
you its kid mccord
  the drivers hat brim bobbed ezra
earp my darter june turning his
glance toward the girl an i will say
mccord the most loyal darter what
ever a man had when i had to run
she wouldnt stay behind hated to
bring her into such a rattlers nest as
these mountings has the name o bein 
well said the kid the soldados
is all thats been said of em an mebbe
some more suns goin down what
say we camp yonder by that crick an
sorta talk things over he quailed in
his heart to think what might befall a
girl of june earps appearance far back
in the range where rustlers and train
robbers and hombres of like outlaw
professions had their camps earp
himself could take chances but it
wasnt fair to allow the girl to do the
same the kid had been an outlaw
only four hours and his conscience
hadnt had a chance to toughen-nor
his heart
 arp agreed to the suggestion that
- they camp darkness found the
three of them gathered around a small
fire the girl did the cooking and it
was mighty eatable thought the kid
he watched her constantly his wide
stetson brim disguising the fact and
empty saddles mean war

wondered if her reticence meant that
she had taken a dislike to him if he
had killed so had her father
  earp waxed talkative over his pipe
while june was clearing up crime of
any kind was evidently new to him and
he was glad to have a kindred ear in
which to pour the details feller
ranchin near me in cactus valley tried
to make up to june there i always
thought he was a snake an bjected
warned him to let her alone she
didnt like him no morn i did but
he kep cornin to see her now an then
final i told him id shoot if he set
foot on my premises agin he didnt
say nothin when he went away that
time it oughtve warned me but my
skull was too thick he waited till i
was off on the range s mornin come
to my place an put his dirty paws on
my june tried to carry her off by
god well by luck she got a-hold o
a gun an drove him away he han-
dled her so rough she fainted after hed
gone an thats the way i found her
she didnt want to tell me whatd hap-
pened knowin id swore to kill-but
it was an easy guess for me an i oiled
up my shooter went right after the
polecat over to his ranch havin first
some leetle difficulty shakin off june-
for my sake not tother fellers i
found gant at his place an i looked
at him through the smoke then i rode
back an got my wagon an june an hit
the trail for here
  the kid was looking at him with a
puzzled expression as he finished his
narrative gant you said the hom-
bres name was-joe gant
yeh joe gant know him
some what time you kill him
earp hooked the pipe out of his
mouth staring in turn what time
why well about three hours ago
joe gant the kid leaned for-
ward why earp i hung that galoot
to the cottonwood front of his house
easy four hours ago
  not joe gant you didnt earp
shook his head positively i know-
whats that he broke off as a great
clamor arose down by the pass that
gave entrance to the soldados both
earp and the kid cocked their ears
numerous hoofs were beating on the
flinty trail coming up and toward them
hossmen said earp
  an cattle added the kid rus-
tlers drivin in swiped stock that hap-
pens right along in these mountains
theyre safe from the sheriff once
theyre through that pass
  aint it a danged shame began
earp himself a ranchman in a small
way and then thought of his own loss
of honest citizenship on the range his
descent to the level or below of these
cattle-lifters approaching he became
suddenly silent and dropped his head
  june standing by and comprehend-
ing swiftly stooped and laid a com-
radely hand on his shoulder she would
share his exile she who had been the
indirect cause of it earp lifted his
head at her touch his eyes warming
with affection
the kid witness to this brief bit of
heart-play half rose to his feet as
the trampling of the cattle punctuated
by the lighter staccato of swift-footed
ponies drew nearer
  theyll pass by on the trail but they
can see over here plumb plain he
crisped best they shouldnt know
youre hereabouts miss earp
  at the kids words her father
started up mccords right jump
in the wagon june thatll sure hide
you
  she turned to comply slowly as if
she did not share the apprehension of
the men she didnt thought the kid
because she did not realize the gravity
of her position here in this stronghold
of lawless men as the girl disappeared

two-gun western novels magazine
through the rear opening in the wagon
cover the hooking lowing herd
crowded past on the rock trail fifty
yards or so from the camp of the
earps and mccord
  the kid and old ezra were hunched
over the fire apparently conversing
but in reality listening and hoping that
none of the horsemen convoying the
herd would take it into their heads to
ride over ordinarily the earp-mc-
cord camp would not have been both-
ered it was an unwritten law of the
lawless who lived in the soldados that
none of the many camps distributed
through the mountains should molest
or interfere in any way with one an-
other one camp might be that of cat-
tle rustlers another road agents an-
other smugglers all engaged in separate
criminal callings but all living to-
gether as in one great rock fort for
mutual protection but one member of
this particular stock-stealing gang re-
turning from a raid was a curious in-
dividual a minder of other peoples
business the covered wagon caught
his eye as he was riding by at the tail
of the herd it looked like newcomers
to the stronghold of the hunted a
wagon was an uncommon sight here
he wondered what was in it once
his curiosity was aroused he must some-
way satisfy it he spurred from his
position in the drag out among the
boulders to the open space where the
fire burned
  the kid and ezra earp turned their
heads as the horseman slashed in with
a strident howdy he pulled up
got down his glance trailing rapidly
over the two faces that were unfamiliar
to him then resting a long moment on
the wagon beyond the fire
  just get in said the rustler push-
ing back his mexican sombrero gun-
runnin jerking his head toward the
wagon well snakes as he spat
the exclamation he bent over his eyes
lighting fastened on something beside
the fire to the left of earp
  earp and the kid shifted their eyes
following his glance a sun-bonnet-
junes shed dropped it and they
hadnt noticed the kid could have
kicked himself-and ezra where had
their eyes been
  the mexican-hatted waddy squatted
down mightily interested he was a
white man though he affected greaser
gear even to chihuahua spurs so
he said in an oily voice youre bring-
in a moharrie in eh wheres she at
dont be stingy hombres lets see-
rthat was as far as he got he was
next to the kid who suddenly lifted
with a growl deep in his throat and
falling on the rustler beat him flat and
insensible with the barrel of his quickly
drawn pistol
  you see said mccord standing
above the senseless form what would
happen to your girl earp if you shoved
on into the mountains you-
  from out of the darkness uptrail the
direction taken by the cattle thieves
a voice bawled hey brazos you
cornin whats keepin you
  a streak of fortune thought the kid
who had acted on hot impulse that the
other tail-rider had not seen his com-
rade struck down mccord was quick
witted he foresaw dire calamity to
the earps-to june earp-if brazos
did not rejoin his gang immediately
instantly the kid called im cornin
in the best imitation of brazos voice
he could muster not a good imitation
by any means but passable on account
of the noise made by the cattle blun-
dering along in the dark stooping
mccord snatched the big sombrero
from the fallen man tossed his own
hat at earps feet and hissed
  take it my hoss an your girl an
yourself an quit these mountains
pronto an stay out if you got any
empty saddles mean war

love for her an i reckon you have
hide somewheres near the pass an ill
join you later
  he stood up then brazos conical
bullion-trimmed hat down about his
ears and jumped for the waddys horse
swung up and rode for the main trail
leaving a much perturbed and marvel-
ing earp squatting by the fire
chapter ii
the kid could have made a get-
away aided by the darkness and
the confusion attending the drive
over the rough dark trail at almost
any moment after he quit earp but
he didnt try he would be chased
and the only way out of the soldados
by the pass led past the late scene of
his impulsive knockdown he wanted
the earps to have ample time to clear
the dangerous neighborhood and hoped
old ezra would have the sense to tie
up brazos before leaving the campsite
the outlaw would not have remained
unconscious very long
  doing his part and more kid mc-
cord hung on as drag-rider of the stolen
herd through semi-darkness that some-
times led up and sometimes down but
seldom straightaway there was a full
moon but little of its light reached the
twisting trail steep walls on either
hand for more than half the distance
to the waddy rendezvous were respon-
sible for this blocking of the moon-
light but the rock formation was in
another way an assistance to the gang
keeping the cattle from scattering the
cows go only forward or backward and
the rustlers prodded them steadily for-
ward
  in less than an hour lights flashed
ahead it was a little rockbound side
valley flooded with moonlight into
which the herd emerged there were
two or three shacks in the open doors
and windows of which the lights
gleamed and several large stockade
corrals into these latter the cattle
were punched and penned up they
filled two of the corrals and the kid
a top hand when he was working at his
regular business estimated their num-
ber at three or four hundred quite a
bunch at one swipe some rancher
back in cactus valley was sore that
night hed bet on it
  the kid because of the strenuous
saddlework required en route to the
waddy camp had been able to avoid
conversation or contact with his com-
panion in the drag a foul-mouthed
hombre who had gone about his work
with oaths and obscenity dripping con-
tinually off his chin now in camp
and the cattle safely impounded prob-
ably to await alteration of their brands
on the morrow the rustlers would
gather together and the kids thin dis-
guise would be penetrated his eyes
sought the dark avenue by which he
had entered this side valley he might
have made a dash for it but several
riders were in between anyhow a
sudden dash might not be the best way
to go about it he hadnt a doubt that
the mounted men carried rifles in their
saddle boots and a bullet from a win-
chester would be more effective in head-
ing him off than horsemen across his
path only a novice could have missed
in the strong moonlight so the kid
debated with a cool brain hed have
to sidle nearer to the out trail before
he ran now the men were getting off
their horses which behooved him to
think and act quickly if he didnt
dismount too theyd get suspicious
but he must stick to the horse if he
hoped to escape he was riding by one
of the shacks while his mind churned
over the situation and a man standing
in the doorway drew the kids atten-
tion

two-gun western novels magazine
   lo brazos called the man see
you made a pretty fair gatherin point
over here i want to see you
 i he kid was in for it but he mo-
mentarily forgot the pressing peril
when he glanced at the speaker the
voice had sounded somehow familiar
a glance in its direction well nigh
stunned him the light from the shack
revealed the owner of the voice as joe
gant ranchman of cactus valley the
same man the kid had treated to a
strangulation jig that afternoon the
man ezra earp declared he had drilled
with a six-shooter there was no mis-
take-joe gant as large as life and in
perfect health apparently when two
men could have sworn on a stack of
bibles that they had put him over the
jump
  you hear me brazos or you got
mud in your ears shouted gant an-
grily for the kid was riding on
  the kid made no reply-in words
he acted slid down apache-style on
the far side of his horse hanging by
hand and toe and struck into a gallop
in the hand he wasnt using to hold on
he gripped his colt and he fired under
the horses neck but missed it would
take practice to shoot accurately in
this unaccustomed position and before
he could launch a second shot gant
moved hurriedly away from the door
realizing what a fine target he made
  from inside the shack gant shouted
at the top of his leather lungs after
him boys if thats brazos hes gone
loco but i reckon it aint brazos some-
body else wearin his hat
  the hat in question had dropped
from the kids head as he swung down
it was much too big and he didnt need
it any longer what he wanted was
room and he proceeded to get it for
himself by firing at the two rustlers
back in their saddles at the first shot
who now tried to bar his way he
must have hit the right-hand rider for
the fellow doubled up in the saddle
the other swerved and the kid pounded
by shooting again under the horses
neck the upright waddy was swing-
ing his gun as the kid sped on trying
to locate some portion of the flying
horsemans anatomy where he might
place a bullet by the time he had
decided to shoot the horse first and its
rider afterward both had vanished
through the dark outlet down the high-
walled trail but the vanishing of the
kid didnt end it nobody had an
idea who he was except that he must
be an enemy somebody masquerading
in brazos slaydens hat every man
had remounted one or two had had
the saddles off their cayuses they
slapped them on again gant ran down
to the horse-corral and got himself a
horse the pursuit strung out of the
rockbound side valley and one two
three up to a dozen along the trail
traveled by the kid
  on his part the kid was exulting
the hard job had been getting out
with them behind him he had a plan
for jacking up the pursuit had no in-
tention of leading them through the
pass near which he had told earp to
seek concealment so when the pur-
suing hoofs were striking sparks from
the rocks uncomfortably close in his
wake the kid executed his stunt he
dismounted with his horse going at full
speed drove it down a draw and let
the pursuit sweep after it while he
himself proceeded on foot toward the
pass
  it was about two hours from the
time he quit the waddy camp on the
run that mccord more than a little
footsore from walking rock in high
heels arrived at the pass into-also
out of-the soldados passing the for-
mer camp-site of the earps and him-
self-he had seen from the trail that
they were gone-and quitting the
empty saddles mean war

mountains he set about locating them
e arp had very craftily secreted him-
self in a hollow at the foot of the
soldados to the right of the pass the
kid found the camp because he was
looking for it because he knew earp
must be somewhere nearby otherwise
he never would have suspected that
three human beings three horses and
a wagon were in the vicinity earp
had had the sense not to light a fire
not even his pipe the hollow was deep
and easily accommodated humans ani-
mals and outfit the blanket of night
made it the most secure of retreats
provided an enemy was not forewarned
of their presence and a thick fringe
of trees and brush on the rim rendered
it an excellent covert by day as earp
could scarcely have known of the place
beforehand the kid complimented his
careful selection of a hideout as he
finally fell on it himself and pushed
among the trees and brush
  mccord hissed a voice in the
black darkness ahead
  sure replied the kid
  good you made a noise cornin in
said earps voice again nearer this
time for i had a finger on the trigger
an id a crooked er if youd come
sneakin well you made out-or-
you wouldnt be here
  skin o my teeth declared the kid
perceiving now the darker bulk of earp
against a dark background you
hadnt no trouble bueno what
about brazos
  hes down there in the holler re-
plied earp turning as the kid brushed
him and falling into step showed
signs o cornin to just after you rode
off so i slammed him agin with a gun
an then hobbled him with his sash an
hanker hes got up all mexican yet
he aint one
  they scrambled and slid now to the
bottom of the hollow where the white
cover of the wagon somewhat relieved
the blackness the voice of june earp
greeted the kid from somewhere near
it the first time she had addressed him
directly
  im-were awfully glad youre
back it was mighty brave o you to
do what you did i hadnt any idea
mr mccord how the outlaws in there
would act toward me i knew-when
i heard that brazos talkin
  yeh he was-is-a sample kid
please miss earp said mr mccord
  june then said miss earp of
all fool things droppin my sunbonnet
if i hadnt-
  i might notve learned somethin
the kid was guilty of interrupting fac-
ing the dim white oval that was the
girls face i found joe gant in there
at the rustlers camp yes sir   as
earp at his side started to explode
joe gant live an kickin-or his dou-
ble an i reckon the lord had the
hoss sense not to make only one o
his kind im makin no mistake earp
he spoke to me as brazos an i saw
him plain in lamp light what do you
figger earp
  i just dont replied the old man
i shot plumb straight ill take oath
an the bullet was made o lead by
grab i seen him fall an lay on the
floor o his office plumb still
  an he had stopped kickin said
the kid when i rode away from the
tree he was lookin up-a hour before
you shot him earp our trails is
crossed a heap an thats whatever
we both is sure we killed gant an yet
hes alive
  that reminds me said earp that
you didnt say what for youd-uh-
hung him you want to
cure said the kid it was jus-
tice in a way though not as strong
as your case id been punchin for
him a month liked him well enough

his office holdin a drop i took a rope
off the wall havin too much respect
for my rawhide to hang such a kiote

tonwood well as he detected a little

remarkable yarn puts anything i

can the sheriff spoke of was brazos

chapter iii
  at dawn the campers in the hol-
a low under the soldados were
- astir they did not have to go
far for water earp had a two-gallon
keg slung under the wagon the kid
risked building a tiny fire of the driest
brush he could find and june got out
the coffee pot and frying pan while
the girl was getting the breakfast the
kid walked over to the prisoner who
was hatless and sitting on the ground
with his back against a rear wheel of
the wagon to which he was tied
   lo brazos the kid greeted the
gaudy figure hows all the rio trim-
mins this mornin say boy i got
some questions to ask you after weve
et you heard us talkin last-
try n get me to tell you any-
thing growled the rustler fixing the
cowpuncher with an evil stare
  i will nodded the kid an if i
dont make out the first time ill try
agin thats me a tryin hombre
hey kid called earp from the
other side of the wagon you want your
hoss unsaddled i never thought o
doin it last night an the pore critter-
never thought of it myself by
golly the kid exclaimed sure i

two-gun western novels magazine
want the leather off him ill do it
earp he left brazos and hurried
around the end of the wagon
  earp was watering the picketed
horses from a bucket the kid af-
fectionately greeted the jg roan which
whickered and nuzzled him as he
stripped away the gear
  come and get it came from june
over by the fire
  thats me chuckled earp hugely
sniffing the fragrant coffee smell in
just a minute
  the kid swung his saddle on his
shoulder and retraced his steps to the
wagon he was a couple of paces from
it when brazos slayden entirely free
of bonds sprang around the end of
the vehicle swinging a nine-inch bowie
the kid was taken by surprise of
course he couldnt readily get at his
sun because it hung on his right hip
and the heavy saddle gear was weight-
ing his right shoulder before he could
drop the saddle and draw brazos knife
would be exploring his vitals from
the ugly gleam of triumph in his eyes
the waddy knew his advantage he
crouched for a leap that would carry
him to the kids side as the latter
paused his knife arm held low against
his leg for an upward thrust at the
abdomen
  greaser to the core huh brazos
exclaimed the kid and with the words
as slayden launched his body hurled
the saddle which he was gripping by the
horn the forty-pound gear of leather
wood and steel smashed into the waddy
as his feet left the ground and slayden
fell flat on his back the kid figured
on him being a trifle stunned from the
solid impact as he jumped forward but
brazos slayden wasnt he was of
tough fibre he still gripped the knife-
handle and scrambling up throwing
the saddle off his chest was already
rising from his knees when the kid
forked him horsewise and crushed him
down nothing would have been easier
than for mccord to draw and shoot
but he had use for brazos alive yet
striving to save the waddy for a future
grilling the kid cheated his own pur-
pose his sudden forceful landing on
slaydens back drove the waddy down
on the blade of his knife-his choking
cry appraised the kid of what had oc-
curred instantly mccord pulled to
his feet and turned the man over but
too late the bowie had bitten in up to
the handle right over the heart
tarp came running and junel
-j they knew from sight of the still
prostrate form and the kids crestfallen
attitude standing over it that death
had visited the camp in the hollow
but they thought the kid had killed
the prisoner
  thought you wanted to ask him
things-or couldnt you help givin him
his come-up-with thus spoke earp
while his daughter stood with pale
cheeks looking down
  accident tough luck replied the
chagrined cowboy when i jumped
an smashed him down his bowie
mustve been pointin up didnt you
search him earp or is that your
knife
  nope an i sure searched him
  his boots
  nope earp looked sheepish
thats where he packed it o course
hell now howd you reckon he got
loose
  the kid stepped around to the
wheel to which slayden had been
trussed he pointed as earp and june
followed to a bandanna with two loops
in it on the ground a sash cut in several
pieces and a slashed rope the last hav-
ing been passed around the late pris-
oners chest and through the spokes
of the wheel
  theres your explanation said the
kid worked his hands out o the
empty saddles mean war

bandanna dug the knife outa his boot
an used it on the sash an rope bet
he had his hands free when i was
talkin to him well well have to do
without him
  they ate breakfast though junes
appetite suffered somewhat from the
knifing incident and the kid and earp
buried the man they knew as brazos
  about half an hour afterwards they
heard hoofbeats out on the plain and
the two men crept up over the rim of the
hollow and through the screening
brush peered out
  mckell  the kid exclaimed and
earp echoed him gutturally for at the
head of the five riders swinging across
the level evidently following a trail
by the frequent glances cast ground-
ward rode the lithe-figured iron gray
sheriff from fairchance
  what had brought the posse to the
foot of the soldado mountains was not
a hard guess for the kid though ezra
earp opened bearded lips to question
  what- he began then the kid
laid a hand on his arm
  listenl he hissed mckell hol-
lerin
  the posse had stopped suddenly and
wrath fully the sheriffs voice was raised
the while he shook a clenched fist
just like always the trail goes on
into the soldados your cows bar-
ton is lost just like everybodys elses
cant get em back nless the govment
will lend us a regiment an a couple
machine guns
  well what the hell bawled bar-
ton the ranchman who had owned the
four hundred steers pushing his horse
up beside the sheriffs no other way
mac nless we could catch some of em
outside
  thats right enough boomed mc-
kell id stake my hope to reelection
next fall that lots o the gangs in them
mountns come to fairchance an
mingle with us drink with us play
cards but-if we dunno who they are
how can we lay em by the heels
  you cant agreed barton well
goodby cows he flapped a disgusted
hand at the pass before them
  the impulse to break cover and in-
form the posse of the identity of at
least one of the badmen of the soldados
seized earp and mccord simultane-
ously for they turned and stared at
each other questioningly
  were fugitives our own selves
said the kid slowly i reckon wed
better not chance it
  i reckon not agreed earp and
sank back
co they remained silent and hidden
from sight while the posse riders
turned about and hit the back trail
slowly and in savage humor
  its funny said the kid as he
and earp dropped down into the hollow
again that mckell dont think o
hidin a bunch of men near the pass an
watch for outlaws to go in or out-like
were doin
  you oughta be sheriff earp de-
clared you shore got more head
than the one in office though macs a
good enough feller if you aint done
nothin
  near noon when they were begin-
ning to think of food again mens
voices and the measured click-click of
loping horses on rock drew the kid
and earp up into the brush again
  if thats gant hissed the kid as
they hustled to the edge of the brush
he aint alone if the odds- he
forgot to finish for his eyes were doing
duty now and what he saw scuttled his
hopes
  the pass was spewing horsemen
two and two abreast and continued
until six had loped forth one of the
van riders on the side nearest the hol-
low caused mccord and earp to face
each other an instant

two-gun western novels magazine
  thats the man i hung said the
kid a half humorous twist to his
mouth
  its the kiote i shot said earp
his brow wrinkled
  then they turned to look again the
six rustlers taking their time pointed
away from the mountains over the trail
recently traveled by the disappointed
posse
  hitch up your team earp the kid
cried sliding backward we cant
cut him out while hes with his gang
but mebbe if we foller well catch him
by his lonesome betcha theyre ridin
to town
chapter iv
the kids words were prophetic
to fairchance cow town the
earp-mccord party trailed joe
gant and his riders june on the wagon
box with her father and the kid astride
the roan on the right the kid set
the pace one that kept them well in
the rear of the rustlers whom they
glimpsed only once or twice ahead for
that matter the wagon loaded with all
the personal and household belongings
that earp could cram into it along
with provisions could not have made
the trip much faster even had it been
necessary or desirable earp had an-
ticipated being absent from his ranch
home a long long time and had taken
everything he could lug or lay his hands
on quickly
  they approached fairchance up a
long draw the town was located on the
dge of the hills the kid suggested
a plan of action en route and earp
having no better to offer and agreeing
to all particulars the cowboy left them
at the head of the draw and paced
smartly townward alone he kept a
wary eye out for the sheriff while seek-
ing the mounts of the sextette along
the hitch rails that fronted the two
saloons and several stores of fair-
chance thought it most likely the
saloon racks were where he would find
them-and he was correct the
howling coyote got the rustler trade
for there were the broncs switching
flies a buckskin a bay a pinto two
sorrels and-where was the dun joe
gant had been riding a dun and it was
not there strung along with the rest
  he turned off the trail somewheres
the kid decided as he jogged over to
the howling coyote last time i seen
em was half a mile from town an all
was together likes not gant went
around to his ranch now les see
these five jiggers come first
  how to capture them single-handed
the kid was a fair revolver shot but
had never had much practice on human
targets rattlers horned toads rocks
even whiskey bottles had served as such
while he was trying to attain speed and
accuracy it was in the use of the riata
that he excelled not only at work but at
play rodeos stampedes and roundups
he could make his rawhide riata talk
his glance now fell on the neat coil in
the tie-straps and brightened just the
weapon to use more effective than a
pair of shooting irons in his hands
but how was he going to get the enemy
bunched so that a single throw would
do the trick if he missed one that
one would be enough to put a hole in
him and jack up the game he couldnt
just walk into the barroom and chuck
a loop at them even if they were the
only customers at the bar which the
five horses at the hitchrack seemed to
indicate for he would be seen and they
would have ample time to dodge one
or more anyway his wandering gaze
returned to the five broncs and down
from the saddle he swung smiling he
had seen nothing of the sheriff and at
this blazing hot hour fairchancers
empty saddles mean war
s
were taking more or less of a siesta
which cleared the stage for the kids
act
  he first untied his rawhide slipped
it over his arm went up on the stoop
and walking beside the hitchrack
deftly pulled loose the knotted reins
of all five cayuses then he spread
a wide noose jerked his gun and fired
close to the head of the nearest untied
horse which was out of range of the
doorway the animal reared at the
sudden blast so close to its ears and
plunged away from the rack with a
snort of fright the four others hardly
less startled dragging reins in its dust
the kid had slapped the gun back in
his holster the instant after he fired
and standing about five paces from the
open door of the saloon was whirling
the huge loop he heard curses and
a stampede of jingling feet and as the
five rustlers squeezed pellmell through
the doorway the big noose sang out
and dropped encircling them the
kid braced back digging high heels
into the boards of the stoop he had
practically duplicated a stunt that had
won him applause and a trophy at more
than one frontier day exhibition
the roping of five horsemen at one
throw
  whoa buckaroos he yelped as
the men began to struggle against the
rawhide trying to get their guns out
the kid pulled his own to quiet them
the first jigger- he began
  whats to pay kid mccord de-
manded a gruff voice not far away
hthe kid flashed a look the sheriff
unnoticed had ridden up was sit-
ting his horse by the stoop and regard-
ing the scene with a wondering eye
he gave the kid a baleful look the
cattle thief from the jg who had out-
witted mckell made him laughing
stock almost
  id tell a man whooped the kid
mac youre just the hombre i want
to see im catchin these buckos as a
present for you hold your guns on
em will you an ill frisk their hard-
ware its straight goods mac theyre
rustlers hot out o the soldados
  he spoke so earnestly the sheriff was
compelled to believe him and the fact
that the peace officer didnt know the
faces of the five-hard faces enough-
added weight in the kids favor mc-
kell pulled his shooters as he swung
out of the saddle to the stoop
  but youre a cattle stealer yourself
mccord he growled edging up to the
five roped men furtive-eyed when they
saw his guns lining them turnin
on your pals
  not any shortly retorted the kid
jingling close to the captives and whip-
ping off the rawhide he fell to lift-
ing irons from holsters right and left
pushing the low-cursing men apart
when they unconsciously hung togeth-
er paralyzed to find themselves in such
a fix
  there said the kid heaping the
guns with a triumphant gesture at the
feet of the sheriff all yours mac
the guns an the owners i was hidin
out near the soldado pass s mornin
when you come along trailin bartons
cattle i heard you ravin you an
barton an you said you bet the wad-
dies come into town an played around
right under your nose but not knowin
who they was you couldnt nab em
well i waited there near the pass an
these fellers come out-an one other
-an i follered em theyre some o
the gang that stole bartons cattle an
who do you thinks the leader ten
guesses you wouldnt guess it so ill
tell you-joe gant so hangin him
didnt work-an im glad you can wipe
that off my record an ill prove be-
fore im through mac that gant
changed hosses with me on the range
yesterday an that im no cow thief i
	two-gun western novels magazine
  whats that you said about hangin
gant the sheriff was evidently mys-
tified but did not let it interfere with
his vigilance over the rustler crew and
the rustlers knew it and were passive
as sheepherders
  well i tried to hang him for the
dirt he done me but- the kid
paused he saw the sheriff had no idea
what he was talking about proving
that gant had said nothing regarding
the lynching that patently had failed
the kid might tell mckell later might
not but just now he had other press-
ing business elsewhere
  where is gant if he was with these
fellers asked the sheriff thinking
something queer about the way the cow-
boy had choked off
  out to his ranch i reckon replied
the kid busy coiling his rawhide an
thats where im goin mac to get him
an bring him back to you-alive id
tell a man i am
  and before mckell could remon-
strate-if he would-the lithe figure
was in the saddle and galloping away
bent over and fastening the faithful
rope in its proper place on the saddle
the kid raced back to the draw
where he had left the earps and
after a few hurried words rode out
again with the covered wagon creaking
after him he might have ascertained
without question the direction taken by
joe gant when he cast loose from his
five men had he cared to backtrack
but the kid didnt want to waste the
time he was eager to corner gant and
would have bet anything he owned that
the renegade ranchman had returned
to the jg it would be about time for
him to turn up there else his foreman
and punchers whom the kid was sure
were ignorant of their employers dual
character would wax suspicions un-
less they were accustomed to him stay-
ing away for long periods on some lying
pretext maybe they were the kid
hoped as he rode with the wagon
rattling close behind that the jg cow-
boys would not be around headquar-
ters if they were and he couldnt con-
vince them of joe gants crookedness
thered be a tangle but earp was
along earp who had shot gant and
apparently missed and june on whom
gant had laid hands the punchers
would believe the girl
  but his fears were groundless he dis-
covered on arriving scouting ahead
of the wagon he left his horse by the
cottonwood where he had tried to
swing gant into eternity and stole
toward the ranch-house he heard
voices very similar voices so much
alike in fact that before he peered
around the door which stood open he
got the idea that joe gant was talk-
ing loudly and angrily to himself the
kid was looking into the office which
was occupied by two men one sitting
-to be exact tied down in a chair-
the other standing facing the evident
prisoner the profiles of both were
toward the kid and their likeness was
so remarkable that but for the fact
that the man standing was dusty from
hat to boots mccord would as readily
have picked the prisoner for joe gant
yet tiie prisoner was now addressing
joe as jim
  if youve set your mind on killin
me jim youll do it so theres no use
me makin a holler in all your devil-
ment stealin from me as quick as you
would from others since you come
down from zuni county ive stood by
you as i thought a brother oughta
seems now id done better if id given
you up to the sheriff
  well mebbe grunted the other
but he prett near had me yesterday
an if that puncher mccords roan
hadnt been handy to swap the grey
for id been caught shore an say
joe i think mccords hidin in the
empty saddles mean war

soldados since he thinks he broke your
neck and he told of the pseudo-
brazos in the mountain camp the pre-
vious night and of the unknowns clever
getaway
  mustve been him damn shame
he was a good feller an a top rope
remarked the tied man youre shore
got a lotta hell on your shoulders
jim
  botherin me too it is jim vent-
ed a nasty laugh then wheeled at the
sound of a tinkling step on the thresh-
hold
  kid mccord had taken his rope
from the saddle when he left it mean-
ing to take joe gant alive if it were
at all possible the rawhide began to
get busy on the person of the standing
man manipulated by a master hand
his movement toward his belt-holster
was arrested by the swoop of the noose
jerking tight about his arms and hold-
ing them immovable the rawhide rip-
pled and jim gants bull neck was
caught in a half-hitch ripping again
and yet again each time noosing a
wrist of gant the lively rope drew his
hands together the kid now stood
but ten feet from gant holding what
was left of the forty feet of rawhide
and grinning widely
  i reckon thatll do said the kid
while the man in the chair muttered
admiration of the feat
  im chokin to death snarled the
kids prisoner
  good thing if he was but he aint
remarked the man in the chair but
he will sometime

of sod down on the grave werent
thinking of the dead they were won-
dering now that estelle king was gone
how long it would take rom king to
get at the throat of his quiet twin
brother rem
old honor stood up he swallowed
a lump in his throat and growled
reckon poor stelles better off it
wasnt much of a life she led after satan
was kilt he glared at rem and added

two-gun western novels magazine
harshly an after you had to be born 
  rom thumbs hooked over his cart-
ridge belt regarded rem maliciously
his grief for his mother secondary to a
feeling of vicious joy estelles death
left rom free to unbridle the hatred he
held for rem rom moved belliger-
ently but honors not here stayed
him postponing the inevitable clash
turning rom led the men down the
slope toward owlhoot house
  big mitch had watched this grave-
side scene with interest now the big
outlaw disliked and mistrusted by all
save rom had a wicked smile on his
lips as he followed the others big
mitch looked like a cat with a fat can-
ary in view
  alone rem king knelt beside the
grave he was glad death had come to
his mother in her sleep and easily life
hadnt been any too good to estelle
king he realized rom and he had been
born the same day estelle got word
of her wild handsome husbands death
satan king had ramrodded seven salty
wanted men when he rode out of dam-
nation valley to rob the sageburg
bank of their number only big mitch
buck honor and an outlaw doctor
called pill had returned
  pill did all he could and saved es-
telles life but the shock grief ordeal
of bearing twins was too much for the
girl after that the mental pattern of
her life became a crazy-quilt she was
subject to bad spells
  well that episode in life was done
with rem rose and slowly regretfully
walked down toward owlhoot house
a long log building beside ripple river
conversation ceased when he entered
the big main room rom turned from
the counter that served as a bar a
wicked wild expression on his dark
heavy face
  been waitin on you so i could give
orders he sneered them i dont
pick for my personal bunch start payin
double for supplies likker bunks an
cabins startin with honor an big
mitch im buildin a crew to go down
an bust the skunks that murdered my
ol man i aim to rob the bank an fill
the whole of damnation valley with
their beef
  id done this before hadnt been
for estelle same as id stomped out
your guts a long time ago hadnt been
she throwed real bad spells ever time
i even looked cross-eyed at you
  rem stood quietly tall slender with
brown hair and eyes in marked contrast
with roms glowering darkness and
heavier body there was little similar-
ity to mark them as brothers much less
as twins all that had been mean and
vicious in satan king nothing that
had been good had been passed on to
rom
  damn you say somethin rems
controlled attitude enraged rom as it
always did you afraid to talk
no i aint afraid of you an the
fact gripes you rem told him your
consideration for estelle was one decent
thing in your favor rom what should
i say about your plans
  this place is as much mine as yours
yy
  like hell it is rom barked im
the first-born by two hours im satans
crown prince an dont you forget it
why damn you if you hadnt been
born estelle might notve been so child-
ish an all like she was
  yeah youre satans crown prince
all right rem admitted he didnt
waste time pointing out how unreason-
able it was to blame him for estelles
condition pill had said estelle might
not have been mentally unbalanced if
twins hadnt arrived the same time as
the news of satans death
ttonor had worshipped satan and
a a the wild outlaw bravery the name
of king stood for hed loved estelle
the kid from damnation valley

merely because she became satans wife
and then the mother of satans first-
born-the crown prince he gave all
his dislike to rem the second-born
because of estelle and because rem
was as unlike satan had been as rom
was like him
  you know how i feel rem went
on the people around the town of
sageburg aint murderers they was
only protectin what belonged to them
from men come to steal it
  hell honor groaned a fine pass
when a king stands up for his daddys
killers you aint no king rem an
its a good thing roms ready to carry
on an make the name feared again
it would be better if the name of
king was carried on to be knowed as
law-abidin an respected rem said
an thats what i aim to try an do
so the name aint respected rom
yelled working himself into a furious
frame you wouldnt talk like that if
you had on a gun you-
  i didnt feel called on to pack an
iron to the burial
  its over with aint it go get your
cutter you salve-mouthed dogie this
valley wont hold both of us go get
your gun an ill fix it so we can both
stay here you savvy
  i do rem nodded an i aint
sure itd be me buried up beside estelle
but i aint cain-or romulus i wont
gunfight you
will you give me a chance to bust
your neck with my bare fists then
rom raged will you you yaller pup
shuck your gun rem said levelly
and peeled off his shirt
  tables and benches were pushed
back and men shouldered the walls
there was no talk no bets were made
not an outlaw there but sensed that
deaths will was omnipresent in the
room and rom king was living per-
sonification of cain and his namesake
romulus brother-slayers both
  stripped to the waist roms torso
showed thicker more muscular than
rems he was a cutlass and rem a
rapier type rem stood straight hands
as his sides rom crouched and started
slowly toward him
  anything goes he snarled and
leaped
  his charge seemed to halt against a
stone wall rems right fist came up
from his hip and crashed against roms
jaw it put him to his haunches it
would have been fair for rem to have
kicked rom while he was down he
stepped back save for a diamond bril-
liance in his eyes his expression did
not change
  rom was damnably silent as he came
up he charged rem stopped swung
the toe of his boot into rems stomach
rem gasped grabbed roms ankle
twisted and dumped him to the floor
again he jumped astraddle of his
back wound his fingers in roms hair
and banged his head against the floor
rom shrieked an oath and rose with
rem on his back and hurled himself
on over with rem under him
  they came to their feet stood toe-
to-toe and slugged blood smeared their
faces their ears it was rom who
finally gave ground he grabbed a
bench and swung it rem ducked un-
der and it shattered against the floor
rom raised his knee and drove it
against rems chin rem spun and
dropped backward rom teeth barred
gleaming scallops in a bloody mask
panted as he leaped into the air and
tried to drive his high heels into rems
kidneys rem rolled one heel ripped
the hide down his left ribs rom
dropped on top of him got his thick
fingers around rems throat and blue-
green lights flashed in rems head
  he fumbled found roms throat with
his own fingers and clamped down the
wheeze of their attempted breathing
was the only sound in the room rom

two-gun western novels magazine
toppled sideways thumping the floor
neither of them let go the others throat
they squirmed kicked rolled over and
over and over tried to surge to their
feet and fell apart rom went to his
hands and knees rem swayed peri-
lously but he had the bitter will to
remain on his feet
  here rom big mitch hissed and
the knife he tossed down clattered to
the floor within roms reach
  buck honors gun slithered from the
holster mitch keep outta king busi-
ness he warned theres only one
reason i even stand for you cornin to
owlhoot house dont press your
luck
  the hell with you i dont see you
grabbin the knife big mitch snarled
  an cross rom get him on the
peck at me him thinkin i was sidin
rem that was your idea wasnt it
mitch you son-
rom had grabbed up the knife he
leaped to his feet and the murder-
ous blade flashed downward rem
swayed aside the blades point leaving
a sudden bloody thread down one arm
roms body followed the drop of the
knife pulling off balance rem raised
on his toes locked his fingers together
and brought both hands down on the
back of his brothers neck
  rom flattened out groaning unable
to rise he was partially paralyzed by
the effects of the rabbit-punch chest
heaving blood smearing him rem stag-
gered and leaned against the counter
  rom at last rolled over and tried to
stand his knees gave under him and
he sat down he squinted hellishly at
rem his eyes swelling nearly shut be-
cause of his broken nose
  ill kill you for this he ground out
no difference where you go ill find
you an let my lead into your guts-
even if i got to hunt you to hell an back
to these desertion mountains
  big mitchs shoulders humped as
rem answered roms sworn intentions
the outlaws fingers made claws close
to his gun butts the colt in honors
fist honors dislike his warning to big
mitch to stay out of king business
stayed the outlaws move
  rem said you wont have to hunt
so far rom god forbid i ever have
to bend a gun on my own brother to pro-
tect myself but if you go on with this
idea of raidin sageburg dirtyin up the
name of king some more while im
tryin to scrub it clean youll see that
im easy enough to find
chapter ii
tripled troubles
sawtoothed ramparts of the
desertions were a blur in the blue
haze far back of rem king the
immediate range was broken semi-bad-
land the country needed a slew of
wet weather too
  rem reined off the narrow ribbon of
dusty road and went down a draw
toward a board-n-batten house a few
head of cattle bearing several different
brands moving out of his path he
found the house had been deserted a
long time the outbuildings were fall-
ing into ruin the lot pond surface was
sunbaked mud cracked and curling
rem stopped in the short shade west of
the house and made a cigarette he
was lighting it when a girl rode around
the corner of the place
  rem straightened regarding her with
the somber respect of the man whose
acquaintance with girls had been scan-
ty she seemed a friendly little person
with a freckle-speckled nose bronze
toned hair tucked under a mans j b
and a generous mouth rems owlis
wary attitude caused her to smile
the kid from damnation valley

  why hello there she greeted i
was riding from asia lanes and cut
into the road behind you but you
wouldnt know asia youre a stranger
else you wouldnt have come here for
water or food i followed you to tell
you theres water in a hole down there
in crow creek
  she raised her arm a quirt dangling
from her wrist and pointed to a distant
line of cottonwood trees and bank wil-
lows unversed in the proprieties all
rem knew to do was thank her and
start for the creek the girl put her
horse in motion beside his she was
without artifice her act was a neigh-
borly one he knew
  thiss the old naslet place she
said just to make talk the bank at
sageburg was robbed more than twenty
years ago the small outfits like nas-
lel lane gordons and rep jones never
have gotten back on their feet but
naslet was the only one to leave
  rem stared straight ahead cursing a
blow that laid men on their backs for
such a time seems like he said
aloud theyve had time to build back
again
  hard luck follows bad there was
blackleg and drouth and her voice
lowered regretfully other drawbacks
too
  she changed what seemed a painful
subject saying but i imagine youre
more interested in a job the pool of
small outfits cant hire riders old jack
hargish of jh connected needs hands
but cant always meet his payroll gurt
kruss of bar  might put you on i
could speak to-
  before the girl could finish trouble
took to them with stomach-emptying
abruptness a rifle rang flatly from
somewhere along the creek ahead the
bullet sounded like a gigantic wasp
passing well above them that shot
rem knew had been a warning an-
other one might not be
  come on rem cried he can
easy see us out in the open he ran
his horse ahead of the girl toward the
creekside timber as he reached the
dry rocky creekbed a rider dashed off
of a liveoak flat beyond rem glimpsed
a fluttering yellow neckerchief and a big
white hat as the man disappeared
around a point of brush
  did you see him the girl didnt
seem frightened only worried as she
reined up beside rem he gave her
a sidewise look he had a hunch shed
also glimpsed the man and probably
knew him
  barely glimpsed him rem told
her but its plain why he tried to
scare us back he rode across the
creek and looked down at a cow on the
ground beneath a liveoak shed been
looped by a foreleg pitchpoled her
neck broken rem turned his gaze to
smoke coming through dust hastily
kicked over a small fire a calf came
out of the brush it bawled of pain of
the leaning lx brand just burned on
its flank as it nosed the cow the dead
animal bore old jock hargishs jh con-
nected brand
  rem lifted his gaze inquiringly the
girl had a harsh lost expression on her
face the brand on the calf leaning
lx is asia lanes she choked asias
in town today makes no difference
because i know he didnt do this no
other pool man did either
  if you know who did it all you got
to do is tell who rem advised
  you dont understand she mut-
tered theres been so much trouble
-and now this i was just thinking
i dont believe it would be a good idea
for you to strike gurt kruss for a job
couldnt you just ride on and forget
what you see here
  i can keep still about this he ten-
tatively agreed but how about
them he nodded at the dead cow
and the mavericked calf for answer
	two-gun western novels magazine
she extended one hand saying give
me your knife
yyhy he acted as he did rem
-couldnt say he did know it was
kicking dynamite around-especially
for a son of satan king
  ill cut the brand off the cow he
said getting down you haze the calf
back into the brush he opened his
knife and set to work he straightened
with a square of bloody hide in hand
  just toss er up to me an keep your
hands still the chill words spoken
from the willows behind rem were ac-
companied by the tap of a gunbarrel
on a saddlehorn
  the girl cried jock hargish as
she wheeled her horse rem turned
slowly staring at the lined bitter face
of the gray-haired man hargish seemed
perplexed let down as he glanced at
the girl his eyes glinted evilly when
he looked back at rem
  the sound of the shot that killed my
row brought me here hargish
growled youre a stranger didnt
know how sound carries around here
i never thought the poold got to the
point theyd call in a thing as low as
a cow-killing mavericker
  he sighed and said to the girl miss
kay it just dont seem you could be
mixed up in anything like this
  im not mixed up in anything she
answered i was showing this stranger
the way to the waterhole when that shot
was taken at us to warn us back im
positive no pool man did this and to
keep down trouble i asked this man
to cut out that brand
  youd go a long way to stop trouble
miss kay hargish admitted
reckon though ill just take that
hunk of hide an this jasper here on
to lanes an have a lil talk
  asias in town she said as for
this man-why i dont even know his
name 
  who are you feller hargish mo-
tioned with his cocked gun
  rem steeled himself groaning in-
wardly my names king
  king hargish snarled the
same name as the black devil that
robbed the bank that time i hear he
sired a couple of whelps that was aptly
nough called romulus an remus an
sure was bein raised up by wolves
king bigod you couldnt be-
  im rem king rem said quietly
bracing himself against the shock of a
bullet from the ranchers gun but
hargish seemed either too stunned or
too enraged to command his trigger
finger it was the girl who made a move
against him she rode forward crying
rem king and i asked you for
help
  she raised the quirt that hung from
her wrist slashed him across the face
put the spurs to her horse and raced
away
  stunned rem raised his hand and
touched the welt the quirt had caused
he looked up at hargish as though
for explanation hargish motioned
with his gun snarling fork your hoss
guess you aint guilty of this laned
never hire no whelp of the wolf that
wrecked this range an give younk
fraly control of things just the same
youre goin along when i show that
piece of hide to lane an maybe you
can explain what damn skunks plan
brought you down here
  no skunks plan rem assured
him as they rode off i aim to live an
honest life try to make up for things
charged against the name of king i
figured this was the country to do it in
yeah hargish jeered stop lyin
first thing youre all mixed up in
somethin meanln trouble
  no rem denied but i cant
understand why the girl-
  quirted you when she learned who
you was thats kay fraly feller
the kid from damnation valley

shes a fine girl even if she is friends
of the pool folks an the niece of younk
fraly at the sagebrush bank-the
skunk kay cant help that though
no more than she can help it her father
mace fraly was killed in that bank
robbery battle in sagebrush seven
months before lil kay was born
  rem gasped hargish grunted
kays mama never lived long damn
you the rancher snarled shes been
dependent on younk whos goin to see
her married to gurt kruss or i miss my
guess
  a blue hopeless funk possessed rem
king blamed for his mothers weak-
ness hated by buck honor despised
by his brother now blamed for a range
being ruined a girls mother and father
being dead and that girl in some diffi-
culties now what would it be like then
after rom came down from the deser-
tions and set his guns and gun-wolves
on them
  rem was on the point of telling jock
hargish of that danger then withheld
the words a look at hargish convinced
rem that a warning could serve no good
purpose at the present time
yvhen they reached sagebrush
hargish stopped before the bank
the squatty sandstone building still
bore the bullet marks of the now his-
toric bloody battle when the bank was
robbed the rancher nodded at an old
wagon and a team in wired patched
harness
  asia lanes he grunted an
speakin of the devil
  hargish motioned to rem as he slid
down and confronted a stooped man
in faded patched overalls he raised
his head and said howdy jock in a
questioning manner
  its this hargish spat holding out
the grisly hunk of cowhide this out-
law whelp of satan king rem king
here cut it off of a jh cow the calf
runnin with her was totin a fresh
leanin lx brand his gaze leaped
from lane to rem then back
  lane stiffened a king he croaked
an you use him to try an tag me with
your hoddam lie he moved one
hand near the pocket of his old jumper
that sagged with the weight of a gun
  rem looked beyond the two men
was glad that hargish hadnt taken his
smokepole away from him a spidery
red-faced bleached cuss stepped out of
the bank a big small-eyed tallow-
padded man stopped in the bank door-
way nervously mouthing a cold cigar
rem glimpsed kay fraly on inside the
bank then turned to hargish
  this mister lane he aint the man
that run down there on the creek
rem declared
  no hargish panted hell you
are in with lane you dirty king
youre lyin for him if you never done
it an lane never-
  rem stared at the spidery man who
stopped with his hand on his gun
white stetson pushed back yellow
neckerchief dangling   
chapter iii
skeletons from hell
silence seemed to pound the
street the spidery mans right
shoulder lifted his eyelids nar-
rowed you accusin me he spat
  yeah you accusin gurt kruss
hargish demanded
  now the girls reason for telling him
to ride on and not hit kruss for a job
was plain to rem plain too was the
fact that the bar  ramrod had faced
this witness in order to discredit him or
gun him out
  never knew you was gurt kruss
an i aint accused you of nothin rem
	two-gun western novels magazine
stated staring at the man how do
you know theres anything to be ac-
cused of rem softly inquired
  kruss twitched like someone had
slapped him you sneakin outlaw

anyhow
  nobody sent for him the man in
the doorway said quickly
  quiet younk kruss snapped

holding the doorway
  younk im not askin you har-
gish almost yelled kay
  everyone stared past younk fraly at
his niece rems nerves tightened his
stomach crawled he sensed that
younk and kruss were close kay
fraly wouldnt turn against her uncle
or the man she was according to har-
gish apt to marry she wouldnt side
one of the tribe that had caused her
fathers death-a man with the welt of
her quirt still livid across his face
  these men would turn on rem pos-
sibly thinking hed done the branding
job for trouble-stirring purposes of his
own rem perceived he was headed
toward hell riding hobsons choice
  color left kay fralys face rem
felt sorry for her and his expression
showed it hargish was making it
damned hard for kay she looked at
her uncle at kruss then at rem draw-
ing a long breath she said i wont
answer your question jock
  younk fraly bit through his cigar
kruss sprang backward like a mon-
goose baiting a snake you double-
crossers  he cried as he pulled his gun
bending it on rem who kruss figured
was the swiftest of the lot
  rem winced as krusss bullet ripped
his ribs his own gun leaping in his hand
as the double explosion echoed along
the street kruss had sacrificed ac-
curacy for all out speed and thereby
made a sacrifice of everything rems
lead knocked an explosive breath out of
the man turned him halfway around
kruss dropped his gun and pressed his
hands to his chest his right knee bent
slowly pulling him back around twist-
ing he fell face downward
  rem stepped back his wide-opened
sickness-revealing eyes shuttling to
lane who had his hand in his jumper
pocket to jock hargish who let his
gun slide back into the leather under
the menace of rems colt younk
fraly had started to finger a  der-
ringer from his vest pocket he jerked
his hand away and stepped close to his
niece when rem looked at him
 you murdered gurt fraly
wheezed gurt wasnt guilty
  kays answer of no answer was an-
swer he was said hargish which
dont mean im pattin this outlaw on
the back what i want to know is
whatd kruss mean by callin out
double-crossers  
  hargish younk the downed man
gasped
  they recoiled staring down at kruss
the walk beneath him was stained with
his blood and blood wetted his lips
despite the bullet in his chest some-
thing drove him on to cling to a few
more moments of life
  younk kruss gasped hitching
himself forward come close some-
thin i got-to say-to you come
the kid from damnation valley

closer younk
  fraly came a step nearer he
screamed and leaped backward as kruss
reached out and scooped up his fallen
shooting-iron he rested on his left el-
bow and fired almost point-blank at
fraly fraly fell backward his scream
chopped short his big body came
down heavily he rolled and kicked
clawing at the gaping wound in his
throat blood pumped between his
fingers as his life ran out he tried to
sit up fell back and moved no more
ten and a few women along the
street moved up warily kay
gripped the doorframe and looked
away shaking her head at a woman who
came toward her
  kruss grinned redly hellishly get
me a drink an hold me up he gurgled
i want to talk an i aint got long
lane raised kruss to a sitting posi-
tion against his knee someone else
held a bottle to krusss lips he looked
at rem as he gulped then rasped
younk sent for you
  of course not rem was puzzled
why should he
  listen all you fools i gotta talk
fast kruss gasped it started with
younk wantin his brothers gal kays
mother he wanted to squeeze the
ranchers too an mace his brother
who was over him in the bank set down
on it younk somehow knew a young
killer named big mitch an got him to
join up with satan king an talk up
robbin the bank down here
  kruss paused lane gave him an-
other drink kruss continued
  it was a trap me an two others-
who happened to later be killed-was
ready younk had gold on top of bags
of iron washers bills outside packages
of paper that was what he put in
satans gunnysack an satan thought
it was cash i when i shot satan outta
his saddle big mitch run to him like
he was tryin to save his life we was
careful not to hit mitch he lit out
with the sack then got his horse down
in a flooded creek he lost the sack so
nobodyd know it wasnt full of money
you ranchers never knowed that i
reckon king never knew the sack didnt
hold money
  i never knew i only know big
mitch was tolerated because it was
thought he tried to save satans life
rem muttered dazedly
  anyhow younk bad the bank
money hisself i had it on him an he
made me the seemin owner of bar 
when he took it from hargish younk
hated me but was afraid to try any-
thing thats why that big mitch got
outta several pen sentences too it was
younk supplied the money secretly
ahhh hargish groaned i lost
bar  i was a heavy holder in the
bank an ive stripped myself these
years payin back what i could to some
of them that lost an-
  an crowdin us lil fellers when
younk through kruss crowded you
asia lane pointedly reminded hargish
  the loan younk pretended to get
from a city bank after he took over
kruss said was the money satan was
supposed to have stolen younk was
worried lately afraid you fellows would
come out enough he couldnt bleed you
for so much interest or grab your range
he sent big mitch word to get a king
whelp to come an raise hell an had me
startin trouble to split you all so it
would be easier i heard big mitch
aimed to work it so hed be the big he-
coon of the outlaw diggins when this
was over with
  krusss head jerked i still think
-younk sent-for you he gasped at
rem his eyes rolled and he slumped
away from lane
  stunned silence prevailed asia lane
cleared his throat and said well har-
gish considerin the money you put in
	two-gun western novels magazine
an all you lost reckon this puts you in
the bankin business an gives you back
bar  i hope you remember how
it is to be in a tight
  i can remember-though that aint
uncrowdin the range
  hargish turned to rem as for
you he said there aint a doubt

served a good purpose you never aimed
to because things went haywire but
because of that ill let you off with

  rem looked at kay fraly shed
given in to grief and was sobbing piti-
fully terribly anyhow she wouldnt
want him here she probably blamed
him for the swift turn of events that
had caused her so much grief a wom-
an stepped up and led the girl away
  you wont take my warnin rem
said to hargish yet youll blame me
if anything happens thats one hell
of a note

got no further lanes self-control
snapped like a rotten cinch his fist
hit hargishs jaw and hargish hit the
dust he sat up emotions of bewil-
derment pain and rage conflicting
within him
  you see he cried more trouble
already lane-
  hell with you you stiff-necked op
devu lane snarled come on king

  rem followed lanes creaking wagon
out of town the color was draining
from his face a mile from town lane
called ride up so we can talk he
looked around gasped stopped and
leaped from the wagon and ran back
rem had fallen out of the saddle he
sprawled in the road the left side of
his shirt and jumper soaked with
blood   
chapter four
ravaged range
eakened by loss of blood
his side inflamed and swollen
where krusss slug bad fur-
rowed over his ribs rem didnt take
to the saddle the next day after get-
ting rem home and in mrs lanes care
last night asia had taken word to
other pool members this morning
they met at the lane place and went
to town together to attend younk fra-
lys burial out of respect to kay and
check with hargish on the new order
of things to be
  lane was in a sour mood when he
returned home that evening as he
unhooked his team he told rem har-
gish is genin mighty aready called
a meetin for tomorrow at the bank
his range is way overstocked an while
hargish is honest he aint fair its
in him to be a range tyrant an to hell
with us little spreads
  he say anything about me rem
inquired
  plenty cussed me too his sore
the kid from damnation valley

jaw made him tempery
  lane let the team into the lot then
said kay fraly asked about you
wants to see you as soon as youre
able to ride
  me see me rem blurted but
what about
  dont know what about rem do
know kays liable to need heavy help
though before her affairs is all straight-
ened out
  early the following morning with-
out waiting for lane or the others rem
saddled up and rode to town a dark-
ening line on the horizon showed thun-
derheads banking hot puffs of wind
blew up dust clouds maybe the range
would get the rain it so badly needed
  rem had learned that kay occupied
a small house of her own in sagebrush
he went straight there dismounting
outside a picket fence and walking up
a path rimmed with dying flowers and
shrubs they made rem think of the
water and trees and green grass up in
damnation valley
  he knocked on the door wondering
why his heart knocked on his throbbing
side kay fraly came around the side
of the house
  why hello there she greeted him
just as she had at the old naslet place
-a moment that now seemed years ago
i didnt expect you so soon kay said
stepping up onto the porch how is
your side
  fine he lied but would you
mind if we sit down here
  he sat down on the edge of the
porch and she followed suit
  an awkward silence fell between
them finally kay said i wish to
apologize to you rem for hitting
you with my quirt
  why forget it he told her
reckon you was in a bad spot an all
an had a right to be edgy i-i was
sorry ior you
  i saw that on your face there be-
fore the bank kays voice was vi-
brantly low your expression told me
a lot of things i want to be friends
rem
  friends with me he mumbled
but my father-
  my uncle was as much guilty of my
fathers death as your father or his
men rem she interrupted younk
was a far worse man than your father
was in his way i never knew until
day-before-yesterday though how real-
ly bad younk fraly was its a terrible
thing for a brother to kill or have killed
a brother
  yeah he agreed twisting his hat
in his hands without knowing why
he did it he began to tell her of his
life why his mother couldnt leave
damnation valley and about his
brother rom kay was silent for a
long time after hed finished then
she laid a warm little hand on one of
his
  i know what it is to be lonely and
feel unwanted she said in a whispery
voice i feel sorry for you rem
even to the names given you and your
brother the pattern seems laid against
you two i remember the origin of the
names romulus and his twin brother
remus were infants thrown into the
river tiber they were rescued and
nursed by a she-wolf romulus was
founder and first king of rome remus
jumped the walls of the city and romu-
lus killed him    whoever gave you
those names
  estelle phil said it showed the
crazy consistency of the inconsistent
phil was a funny jasper an the only
real friend i ever had i often wish
i could see him again he rode off
one time an never come back
  what do you intend doing now
kay inquired
che drew back then staring at him
in amazement rem had risen his

two-gun western novels magazine
face gone suddenly bleak his attitude
grim and quiet as the steel of a six-
shooter is quiet he looked off down
the road to where it widened and be-
came the main street
  im goin an have a talk with the
three men that just come up an left
their horses in front of the sagebrush
bar across from the bank rem said
in a hell-hollow voice buck honor
big mitch an my brother roml
wait rem kay cried clinging
to his arm get help
  no maybe this can be settled with-
out another pitched fight with inno-
cent folks gettin killed an wounded
an you stay here
  he shook her off and strode down the
path mounted and rode down the street
without once looking back at the girl
he reined up and got down two doors
from the saloon pausing to glance at
jock hargish and three of his riders
as they came in up at the feed corral
maybe hargish expected trouble with
the pool members today
  loosening his iron in the leather
then rem drew in a steady long
breath stepped quickly down to the
sagebrush bar and inside three long
strides took him to the bar close to
buck honor big mitch stood next
then rom the trio tensed mouths
wide open as rem faced them
  kind of early for you gents to be
out aint it he asked
  wait honor forestalled roms
move as his shoulders hunched
  well mister king an your
pleasure the swamper and morning
bartender inquired i was just start-
in to tell these gents about the gunfight
across the street funny but yknow
id swear id seen the two on this end
someeres before an the othern too

fight a couple days ago when younk
fraly an gurt kruss was killed
  wh--whatl big mitch blurted and
honor gave him a keen glance in the
backbar mirror
  yeah i shot kruss an he killed
fraly as he was dyin but he talked
mitch kruss told a lot of things   
hold er damn you rem rested his
hand on the butt of his gun rom

cided wed leave the boys outta town

  rem moved out a step and poured
out the story
  its a lie big mitch snarled its
nothin but a trick to mess things up
this lard-mouthed-
  i dont think it is a trick mitch
honor broke in harshly i always
wondered about the hot lead reception
that time an the way your hoss went

mitchs guts out then dump this but-
tin-in rems innards

bodys openin the bank an them three
gun-packin rannies loungin around
dont look good no-
  hell yes rom raged leaped out
and went for his gun the ensuing
scene was a blur of motion rem freed
his gun and jumped aside he could
have gunned rom in that moment but
something stronger than his own neces-
sity stayed his trigger finger roms
gun roared big mitch pulled a trigger
and jarred up against the bar by the
shock of a bullet buck honors gun
the kid from damnation valley

added to the thunderous din
  big mitch was hammered off his feet
and was dead before he hit the floor
honor yelled at rom run for er
and grabbed at him rom screeched an
oath and fired at rem who stepping
backward felt the slug fan his face as
he tripped and fell over a chair
  ah damn you ill teach you  an-
other bullet ripped into the floor beside
rems body honor shoved rom
yelled at him again managed to make
him savvy they had to run they
belted through the doorway and hit
their horses
  hargishs riders went for their guns
but a yell from their boss in the banks
doorway stopped them it might be
some sorta trick hargish yelled
stay where you are
  rom and honor pounded up the
street as they turned the corner they
almost piled up on lane and the other
pool men the pair raced on ran out
of sight over a rise and were gone
d em came out of the bar as lane
a and the rest ran down and got off
their horses big mitchs in the saloon
plumb dead rem called that was

in at the bank

at his men he presented lane and the
others a stubborn angry expression
givin orders too youll mighty soon
be findin out i-
  he stopped speaking with his mouth
open his eyes getting larger and larger
then hargish made a croaking sound
and pointed out toward the range
  they-theyve set fire to the
range hargish screamed
  stunned the group watched a grow-
ing smoke cloud filled with flying ashes
whip into the darkening sky now the
roar of the wind-driven flames in pow-
der-dry grass grew in their ears at
other points fire sprang up as rom
and his followers ran setting their fires
on the way
  no human could stop that fire
lane croaked an youre the one
hargish that wouldnt let us chase
them keep em goin
  the street was suddenly alive with
townfolks as the sky became darker
and ashes began raining down into sage-
burg the roar of the fire was loud
growing then fading in the distance
lane in the group before the bank
offered up thanks
  thank god he cried our families
an homes will be safe there aint
enough grass back in the badlands to
carry the fire across the ravines an
cut canyons
  a red-eyed smoke-blackened cow-
puncher raced down the street hey
jock he called out to hargish bar

jh connected is gone a lot of beef

at his men lounging nearby

  his fist hit hargishs jaw and har-
the kid from damnation valley

gish hit the floor
  outside kay caught up with rem
and drew him aside while rep went

  but no matter what happens rem
ill pray while youre going to make a
place for our herd if you care-ill

  she sobbed rose on her toes and
kissed him and ran
  rem carried that kiss with him on
the way into the mountains it was
in his mind the morning he and rep
jones came through slot pass unchal-
lenged and part of the valleys spread
lay before them

gasped rem-hell its heaven

  rem drew in a great breath of the
crisp piney air and went toward owl-
hoot house when he rounded a cor-
ner rep jones drew a gun and moved
to a window where he could look in
  as he paused at the door his hand
on the latch rem could hear roms
voice inside honor you aint goin
to croak he snarled youll live to
see me kill that cowardly rem an
make the whole west run when they
hear the name of king sit up buck
rom i got mine i just hung an

way to carry the king name on
  shut that upl rom yelled and in
that instant rem went in
  honor sat with his back against the
wall his face ashen there was a bot-
tle on the table before him rom sat
on the counter a half-emptied bottle
by his side
  running the gamut of emotions at
rems appearance rendered rom
speechless at first he gulped lifted
his bottle and drank then hurled it
straight at rem rem ducked and the
bottle crashed against the wall
  rom slid off the counter shaking
his head rem was the first to speak
wait rom he begged listen to
me ive as much right here as you

two-gun western novels magazine
the poor devils you burned out down
below have a right to this valley for
their cattle and homes after the years
they suffered on account of the trick
of a king its up to us-
  hush damn you rom bellowed
didnt they trick satan you damn
right one of them did anyhow an
you throw in with them go against your
own kind down there you think id
step out an see them come in here
into a valley satan king found cuss
the name of king eh hell they aint
even started havin reason to cuss
rom settled his feet apart as his mad
rage ran hotter
  im startin with you-
  wait rom old buck honor cried
roms gun was flashing up every
nerve and fiber in rem cried out for
speed yet he was slow held back by
the damning fact that this was his
brother he faced
  rom buck honor screamed and
his gun thundered and echoed in owl-
hoot house the barrel rested back on
the table top then the gun slid out of
his hand
  rom king raised both elbows stood
on his toes his gun thumped the floor
a ragged sigh passed his lips then and
he went down limply
  rem didnt couldnt realize what
had happened his eyes wide mouth
agape he shook his head slowly and
stared down at rom buck honor
gave a despairing croak pushed to his
feet he staggered the distance to
rom and dropped down beside him he
pulled roms head up on his lap
  rom boy honor sobbed tears
streaming down his grayish seamed
face rom listen you died easy
not like sufferin with a bullet in the
belly not like bein caged up before
they took you out to hang you up an
itd been like that boy maybe the
name of king aint stood for what it
ought maybe satanll savvy rom
it all come clear to me the best way
to make the name a proud one was to
let rem pack it on like hes started
rom you can forgive me
  rem you reckon romll under-
stand honor begged hell know
why i done er wont he rem
  old buck honor shuddered and bent
slowly forward so he died his head
on roms body a smile on his lips
rthe three outlaws standing beside
	the graves werent thinking of the
dead they were wondering how long
it would take them to get out of damna-
tion valley
  rem patted the last piece of sod
down on the mound above buck honor
he stood up swallowing a lump in
his throat he said i reckon theyre
both better off an they never died
without leavin somethin good behind
  this valley an its tributaries aint
goin to be crowded for a long time
well see it aint after we get in a
road well build a little town around
owlhoot house along ripple river
well have just about all we want or
need down there
  yeah rep jones agreed an
whatll you call the town kingville
satan some name like that
  why no rem answered well
name it after a man who thought
enough of another mans name an
memory he tore his heart out for it
a man who killed the thing he loved
above all else in order that at last
that name would rightly carry on
honor worshipped satan an rom sa-
tans crown prince meant more to
honor than life itself
  honor thats what well name the
place honor
  he moved down the slope toward
owlhoot house to get his horse and
ride down to love then back to honor
where it would be fine to obey the dis-
tates of happiness   
  borrowed bullets
by
ralph berard
author of colt-wise-or plumb loco etc
cutting sign on a notch-hunter of the jack rabbit kids calibre any range city
son but race gordon would have thought first of the two thousand dollar reward
offered for the bandit dead or alive
races weapon had spoken again
the body was sprawled face
down in the dust arms out-
stretched blood stained the
dead mans shirt the stiff whitness
of the clutching hands in the early sun-
light told young race gordon even be-
fore he dismounted that the man was
dead his horse a nervous-looking
high-bred grey mare grazed some fifty
feet from the short-cut trail to range
city
  race hesitated a moment standing
there looking down at the still form he
finally stooped and turned the body
over then stepped back startled a
wild scatter of disconnected thoughts
chasing through his brain
  anyone living within a hundred
miles of range city would have recog-
nized the jack rabbit kid from the
reward posters stuck up all over the
country most anyone except race
gordon would have thought first of the
two thousand dollar reward offered for
the bandit dead or alive
  but race thought of something else
of the kids reputation of how the
jack rabbit kid had fought and killed
every man within a thousand miles was
afraid of the jack rabbit kid
g	two-gun western novels magazine
  all of his nineteen years race had
wanted to be feared and respected like
that and in the last four years he
had had a specially good reason
  when race had been only fifteen
hed heard his father tell how gatz
blemming and three hired killers had
seized control of range city and
started to drive the small ranchers out
of the valley even then race had
sometimes brooded over the thought
of riding to range city and shooting
it out with gatz blemming but hed
known of course how foolish and im-
possible it was and the best he could
do was to borrow his dads gunbelt
without his permission and sneak to a
draw in the hills where he practiced
his draw and his aim his dad hear-
ing the shots one day had ridden out
and surprised him there
  whore ya planning to kill jake
gordon had asked sternly
  race had drawn his skinny six feet
up an extra inch and swelled out the
strong frame of his sinewy thin chest
and said when i grow up ill kill
anyone who steals from you or mom
or ritzy
  youre mighty young for guns his
dad had said but its a hard country
dont reckon ya can learn your shoot-
ing any younger jake gordon had
swung his horse and ridden slowly away
without looking back race had stared
after him for a moment then had re-
turned resolutely to his practicing that
same evening jake gordon had given
the lad the guns and the belt and his
blessing
  now it had been just two years since
cal fetters the loyal foreman of jake
gordons four bar spread who had
stuck by them through a long siege of
drouth and rustling had found the hon-
est old ranchers bullet-ridden body far
out on the north range and the full re-
sponsibility of the four bar had been
thrust suddenly on races youthful
shoulders fetters had told race i
know it was gatz blemmings men who
killed your dad we saw the whole
thing but it wouldnt be no use me
claiming that id likely just get killed
for my trouble
  race had understood how things
were and he hadnt blamed fetters for
not talking but as long as jake gor-
don was alive the range city bank
which gatz blemming had also got con-
trol of had pretended leniency in re-
gard to a past due payment of fifteen
hundred dollars against the four bar
hardly however had races father
been buried before the bank filed fore-
closure notice
  it means well lose everything
races grief-stricken mother had said
and when he looked at her haggard
face he had felt a hot dagger of passion-
ate hate stab him deeply hed watched
his kid sister ritzy trying to comfort
his mother and hed sworn in tight-
lipped silence that hed settle with gatz
blemming regardless of what happened
to himself
  he had started this day for range
city to make what he knew would be
a last futile appeal to the bank then
he would try guns blemmings hired
gunmen drag shanto kale bletsin or
jake fundy might kill him but some-
how it hadnt seemed to matter hed
looked into his mothers anguish-filled
eyes and seen the pleading hopelessness
in his little sisters face and nothing
much seemed to matter except the need
to satisfy a kind of blind madness like
a red burning passion that spurred him
on and augmented the reckless deter-
mination of his youth and increased
his deep faith in the rightness of his
cause
race recalled as he looked down
at the jack rabbit kid how his
father had once said as long as the
jack rabbit kid lives us small ranch-
borrowed bullets

ers has got a chance the kid aint
really against whats right even if he
is on the owlhoot if ya notice right
close yall see his depredations is
against them what got their positions
by robbing and killing they say the
kids dad owned a ranch that was lost
almighty mysterious-like when his old
man died
  just like me race gordon thought
now as he looked at the corpse then
he let his bridle strap drop and he
kneeled by the kids body it was still
warm the kid hadnt been dead very
long race straightened the legs and
the arms so that when the body was
cold it could still be put on a horse a
sort of wild scheme was finding shape
in his mind he gave up the useless
idea of talking with blemmings banker
again
  race unbuckled the kids guns a
pair of perfectly matched pearl-handled
weapons he unbuckled his own then
took off his trousers and shirt it was
a dank unpleasant business this strip-
ping the outer clothes from a corpse
and putting them on he folded his
own things neatly and laid them on the
ground then he tucked them under
the kids head so they wouldnt blow
away and so theyd be there when he
came back he grinned at himself
mockingly when he came back
what he meant was if he came back
  he straightened and practiced a
couple of times drawing those guns of
the kids they balanced in his long
fingers and leveled out fine race
grinned a hard chiseled grin like men
sometimes wear when they die he
clamped his teeth tightly together and
walked with slow determined steps to
where the kids grey horse was graz-
ing
  the mare raised her head and moved
her ears forward race spoke to her
softly and it seemed odd how calm and
even his own voice sounded it was
like hed always been a killer as if he
knew the horse would stand still and
welcome his weight in the kids empty
saddle
  he mounted then and rode toward
range city leaving his own horse graz-
ing nearby he fashioned a mask for
his eyes from a black cloth he found
in the kids pocket the kid was a
tall skinny fellow like himself   
and men were afraid of the kid
  it was noon when race gordon rode
into range city with the black mask
over his eyes he sat straight in the
saddle and kept his face forward the
horse kicked up grey dust that lay in
the street and it drifted heavy in the
hot air like a thick ominous cloud fore-
casting a storm
  the few townspeople who were about
ducked out of sight because they
thought race gordon was the jack
rabbit kid race rode to the wildcat
saloon and dismounted it seemed to
him as if there wasnt much air in the
town and he moved along easily as if
walking in a subconscious dream the
batwing doors seemed so light he strode
through hardly knowing hed pushed
them
  inside it was dark and suddenly
cool it occurred to him then that may-
be hed seen the last of the sunshine
but he still kept a grin on his face down
under the mask and he looked a lot like
the jack rabbit kid
  there was the long bar on the right
with blemmings spying white-sleeved
barkeep behind it empty chairs and
tables cluttered the place perhaps a
dozen men were sitting about bletsin
and fundy sat at a far corner table
he didnt see blemming or shanto any
place about
  race knew that every eye was on
him and he vaguely wondered why
hed even forgotten the mask on his
face and didnt realize now that men
who peeked in from the crack of the

door were watching to see what the
jack rabbit kid was going to do there
was no more sound in the place than in
a graveyard at night
  race kept looking for gatz blem-
ming but the man hed come to kill
for dry-gulching his father was not
there race moved forward with
measured steps and stopped by the bar
then turned his back hooking his el-
bows on the hardwood unmindful of
the pale-faced taut-lipped barkeeper
behind him
  but he heard the faint click of metal
and knew it was the hammer of a gun
being cocked
  instinctively he whirled on his toes
a shot sounded and lead whistled close
only his sudden movement had saved
him from the barkeepers lead when
he had tried to shoot race in the back
so he could claim the reward for the
jack rabbit kid
ne of the ivory-handled guns came
into races hand as fundy jumped
up from his chair with a weapon raised
fundys gun blazed as race leaped and
rolled over the counter he pumped
lead into the barkeepers stomach as he
dropped to the floor he had drawn
his second gun in the same movement
he fired fundy stared gulped and
pitched forward
  bledsins gun kept flashing lead
thudded into the counter the bar-
keeper rolled over and was still race
saw blood on the front of the shirt he
was wearing but the blood was dry
it was the blood of the jack rabbit
kid race had sprung from the floor
and rolled over the counter in the same
jack rabbit movement that had made
the kid famous the set grin was still
on his face and he hadnt been hit
  he hunkered along behind the coun-
ter now the shooting stopped bled-
sin couldnt see him then race stood
erect got bledsin squarely lined in his
borrowed bullets

sights and fired he fired again bled-
sin clutched at his waist his gun spun
in the air as he fell
  new bullets hailed across the bar
now glass from the mirror and from
broken bottles showered down men
crouched behind overturned tables all
who werent cowards were trying to
kill the jack rabbit kid and claim the
reward
  race hunkered along toward the
rear he reached a rear window and
felt a bullet burn through the flesh of
his hip as he toppled through in a
shower of glass he came to his feet
in the alley and found himself laugh-
ing crazily laughing and running hed
done for two of the men that he
wanted hed have to come back for the
others
  a shower of late lead whistled around
the corner of the building as race got
safely around it he holstered his guns
ran along the far side and stopped at
the corner he stood there a split sec-
ond to straighten his mask
  a dozen men came running yelling
wildly after the reward for the jack
rabbit kid perhaps they thought
they had winged him
  race held the kids guns firmly one
in each hand he stepped around the
corner and faced them with the guns
leveled deadly taken by surprise the
men stopped as if theyd run into a
wall
  the first man t level a weapon
dies said race gordon he appraised
them a moment with calm deliberation
and knew they were afraid sheriff
ballard wasnt among them and race
was glad of that because he didnt want
to mix with the law or kill any inno-
cent person he held them off with one
pointed gun while he got to the kids
grey mare and climbed up into the sad-
dle bullets followed as he rode out
of town but he was low and skinny in
the kids saddle and none of them
reached him
i talked with god
yes i did--actually
and as a result of that little talk with god a
strange power came into my life after 
years of horrible dismal sickening failure
everything took on a brighter hue its fasci-
nating to talk with god and it can be done
very easily once you learn the secret and
when you do-well-there will come into
your life the same dynamic power which came
into mine the shackles of defeat which
bound me for years went a-shimmering-and
now--well i own control of the largest
daily newspaper in our county i own the
largest office building in our city i drive a
beautiful cadillac limousine i own my own
home which has a lovely pipe-organ in it and
my family are abundantly provided for after
im gone and all this has been made possible
because one day ten years ago i actually and
literally talked with god
  you too may experience that strange
mystical power which comes from talking
with god and when you do if there is
    and literally
 poverty unrest unhappiness or ill-health in
 your life well-this same god-power is able
 to do for you what it did for me no matter
 how useless or helpless your life seems to be
 -all this can be changed for this is not a
 human power im talking about-its a god-
 power and there can be no limitations to
 the god-power can there of course not
 you probably would like to know how you
 too may talk with god so that this same
 power which brought me these good things
 might come into your life too well-just
 write a letter or a postcard to dr frank b
 robinson dept j moscow idaho and full
 particulars of thia strange teaching will be
 sent to you free of charge but write now-
 while you are in the mood it only costs one
 cent to find out and this might easily be the
 most profitable one cent you have ever spent
 it may sound unbelievable-but its true or i
 wouldnt tell you it was-advt copyright

     dont delay-do it now
  in the first ravine that would hide
himself and the horse he drew up his
wound was only a scratch and had al-
most stopped bleeding but it made
him feel stiff and it pained still he
was grinning and what he had done
didnt seem anything great
  race waited there in the ravine he
kept thinking of his mother and of his
kid sister and of how his job was only
half finished he wasnt much afraid
of a posse because it seemed the sheriff
had been out of town if anyone did
follow him theyd never expect him to
stop this close to town
  just after dusk he spurred the horse
out of the ravine and rode back to
range city it was pitch dark when
he tied the grey mare behind an aban-
doned building on the outskirts of town
he ran eagerly to the rear of the wild-
cat and found as hed expected that
the window he had leaped through had
not been repaired
  peering through the broken glass he
saw that the place had been cleaned
up there was a larger crowd inside
than there had been at noon a new
barkeeper was serving the drinks
  race could only see behind the coun-
ter and a little past the end of it out-
side the boilding he was in shadow
and there was little chance of them
seeing him suddenly he realized some
men were sitting at a table to his right
he couldnt see them but he could hear
their words
  you werent here during the fight
at noon still ya got a bullet wound
an authoritative voice accused howd
it happen
  i tell yuh boss i shot it out with
the jack rabbit kid just before day-
light
d ace strained closer held his ear
to a glass next to the one which
was broken
  youve always boasted shanto
borrowed bullets

about getting the jack rabbit kid
suppose you killed him this time a
low satirical laugh followed the words
then races teeth snapped together
and his right hand clutched a gun han-
dle he recognized gatz blemmings
voice
  dont guess i killed him shanto
was saying but he swayed a lot in
the saddle and he didnt follow  he
spurred out o range mighty pronto
  blemmings mocking laugh rose
louder ya slipped shanto ya al-
most admitted he didnt follow when ya
ran away
  the jack rabbit kids guns came
into races hands again their ivory
handles feeling warm and friendly in
his grasp their long barrels crashed
the remaining glass of the window he
stepped inside and faced the men at the
table
  shantos coal black eyes flashed
mixed hatred and fear he saw the
black mask he recognized the jack
rabbit kids guns
  the roomful of men stood watching
tense eager but hesitant gatz
blemming was watching his hand near
his gun but making no effort to raise it
  race let a quick glance sweep the
room he saw the crowd standing si-
lent motionless like tintype pictures of
men sheriff ballard stepped suddenly
out from the others and began to move
forward
  race swung around to face the law-
man he let the muzzles of his guns
drop down dropped the weapons them-
selves back to their holsters he felt
the cold crease of his grin come back
on his face as a plan came to his mind
and he watched with the tail of his
eye to see shanto slowly snaking out his
gun he felt rather than saw gatz
blemming shift in his chair the sher-
iff was still a dozen paces away and
blemming didnt want the jack rab-
bit kid to be taken alive

  shantos gun came up almost level
blemmings weapons were ready in his
hands and when shanto would have
fired race jerked himself back as a
jack rabbit crouches before it leaps for-
ward as shanto fired he threw him-
self downward and forward and came
to his knees ansjvering the fire both
shanto and blemming had started
races weapons spoke again and again
they spat out the hate and lust for
vengeance that sprang from inside him
while his leads drove deep into shanto
and deep in blemming he felt their
leads seeking his own flesh he stum-
bled fell and rolled back through the
broken window
  he got somehow to those few quiet
blocks at the edge of town where hed
tied the kids horse in the blackness
shouting and the sound of horses hoofs
came from in front of the wildcat
race didnt spur the horse into flight
he held it in check and let it pick slow
steps between the dark buildings that
cast no shadows in the absolute black-
ness the little sound his horse made
was lost in the greater noise of the
sheriffs hastily organized posse race
was a mile away before the posse was
ready and then they didnt know which
way to follow because of the darkness
dut the first streaks of dawn found
the posse close on his trail in day-
light it wasnt a hard trail to follow
the tracks of his horse led along the
short cut to the four bar ranch
streaks of blood marked the way
  they were less than half way when
sheriff ballard halted his party two
horsemen were riding toward them as
they came nearer they saw that one
man was slumped and stiff he was
dead his body tied to the saddle of the
grey horse a thin tall youth on a
cowpony came leading the grey the
youth looked familiar to ballard and a
moment later he recognized race

  race said weakly had quite a fight
sheriff but i killed the jack rabbit
kid im claimin the reward
  ballards eyes narrowed yeah
he said doubtfully he rode up to race
and yanked his guns from his holsters
then he drew alongside the dead mans
mount drew the ivory handled guns
from the kids belt and frowned then
he fingered curiously the red ribbons of
the jack rabbit kids torn left shirt
sleeve and raised clear honest eyes to
meet races you were wearin the
kids clothes when you got yer hand
busted up he accused
  but races eyes had fluttered shut
he reeled in the saddle and a deputy
whose horse stood nearest barely kept
him from falling
  he got back his senses on the way
into town he was riding in front of
somebodys saddle and that was about
all he could tell the jerking of the
horse jarred his head and he couldnt
get coherence into his thinking pretty
soon he passed out again
  then he was sitting in old doc reyn-
olds office and someone was sponging
his face sheriff ballard sat beside
him he felt pain in his hand in his
arm down in his leg and in his hip
  youre not going to die the doc-
tor said
  race tried to grin he thought
vaguely about billy the kid and the
luck that went with fighting for a good
cause didnt figure i would he
said then turned toward the sheriff
did you send word to my folks
  i sent a deputy ballard said
they ought to get here after a little
race raised on his elbow he was
weak but he felt a little excited i
killed the jack rabbit kid sheriff i
shot him in the right side under the arm
youll find a hole in his shirt where
there isnt one in my body i took his
clothes and rode into town and i killed
four men that every honest man in town
borrowed bullets

wanted killed and i never killed one
of them till he shot at me first
  the sheriffs face was stern you
impersonated an outlaw which gave em
a right to shoot you on sight
  they had their rights race
grinned only theyre dead and i
aint im still claiming the reward
ive got to have fifteen hundred dollars
down to the bank by tonight to save
the four bar for mother and ritzy
doc reynolds put a kind hand on
the lads shoulder son he said
sheriff ballard asked me to examine
the jack rabbit kid and say how long
hes been dead i havent told him yet
but i just came across the street and
i saw people standing in little groups
and i heard them talking theyre
saying lad that the outlaw was the
best friend this town ever had theyre
planning to give him a mighty fine fu-
neral they think the shooting you
did was done by the jack rabbit kid
its better i think that they shouldnt
know any different you could have
killed the kid after he did his shooting
here that way youd be entitled to
the reward and folks couldnt stay mad
at you long for killing an outlaw with
a price on his head the old saw-
bones sighed deeply and turned to bal-
lard
   sheriff he said no doctor can tell
exactly how long a mans been dead if
race gordon here says he killed the
kid i dont see how you can prove that
he didnt the kid was killed with a
 bullet and thats the caliber of
races guns
  ballard smiled slightly and nodded
his understanding guess maybe
youre right doc race ought t have
the reward
  race lay back then with a little sigh
of relief he had a feeling as if the
jack rabbit kid were there in the room
saying it sounds all right to me part-
ner its the way id want it to be
