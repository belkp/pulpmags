if you go to the end of a rainbow so the
fairy talcs say youll find a pot of gold

  of course no grownup believes this but
its surprising how many people believe
what amounts to the same thing

  that is many of us have a dreamy no-
tion that somewhere sometime well come
upon a good deal of money we go along
from day to day spending nearly all we
make and believing that somehow our fi-
nancial future will take care of itself

  unfortunately this sort of rainbow-chas-
ing is much more apt to make you wind up
behind the eight ball than with a pot of gold

  when you come right down to it the only
sure-fire way the average man can plan
financial security for himself and his family
is through saving-and saving regularly

  one of the soundest most convenient ways
to save is by buying u s savings bonds
through the payroll plan

  these bonds are the safest in the world
they mount up fast and in just  years
they pay you  for every  you put in

  so isnt it just plain common sense to
buy every u s savings bond you can
possibly afford

p s you cau buy u s savings bonds at
any bank or post office too

save the easy way buy yojjr bonds through payroll savings

this business of arranging efficient
which means safe human transport
faster than the speed of sound is prov-
ing to be quite a problem for scientists engi-
neers and flyers alike since young de havil-
land test-flew one of his own companys
experimental ships into oblivion over the
thames estuary none of the pilots now en-
gaged in trial flights are anxious to pull the
string and let her rip

  the big hitch seems to be that when things
go wrong at near-sonic speeds there is no
way of undoing the damage in time to avoid
destruction and no one yet has devised a
means of escape from a hunk of high-pow-
ered metal which flies through the air at
more than  miles per hour

  although rewards as high as  have
been posted for the first successful super-
sonic speed-flights to date there is no line-
up of daredevil pilots nudging each other
out of the way to grab this comfortable wad
of cash

  after all you cant take it with you

the first rocket plane

  for the moment our one publicized hope
of achieving such humanly piloted speed
seems to rest in the armys bell xs- the
first of our rocket planes which managed
to hit about one-third of its projected 
miles-per-hour velocity on its first flight
when released from under a b-

  however the xs- is all in all a very
orthodox looking airplane with wings for-
ward cockpit rudder and elevators like
every other plane save the flying wing de-
signed since the early days of world war
one

  somehow we cant help feeling that some-
thing new has got to be added-and added
to the basic concept of flight design after
all humanity didnt conquer speeds of more
than thirty miles per hour with a horse-it
took the steam engine to make such travel
feasible to say nothing of safe

supersonic projectiles

  to date the only supersonic projectiles
man has created are cannon shells and rock-

ets-with the mighty german v- rocket
leading the way unfortunately no man has
yet survived travel in a high speed rocket
or shell we expect the human projectiles
so beloved by carnival and circus customers
because they have not yet traveled fast
enough to pierce the net that catches them

  so it seems a safe bet that supersonic
travel when it comes will be accomplished
in more of a rocket designed for safe land-
ing than an orthodox plane with rocket at-
tachments or perhaps it will be something
like frank r stocktons littlest giant and
tallest dwarf-both of which turned out to
be ordinary men perhaps the key is some-
thing exceedingly simple whose very avail-
ability has defeated so far the efforts of our
scientists and engineers to discover it

  but supersonic travel must come and
therefore will come for only through such
travel can man attain release from the grav-
ity of earth which is the pathway to sorely
needed new frontiers-the moon the plan-
ets perhaps the stars themselves

  meanwhile the barrier remains as an
opening challenge

our next issue

	t was indeed a curious circumstance

	every scientist who got on the track of
the true causes of the non-cosmic lawson
radiation fell victim to amnesia which de-
stroyed his value as a scientist it was gen-
erally felt after a number of such failures
that the radiation itself was in some way
dangerous and that its investigation should
be halted

  but the last of the scientists to lose his
memory recovered-and recovered with his
recollection of things past a knowledge so
fearsome that when he a tempted to explain
it to his colleagues he was deemed a schizo-
phrenic

  spies from a distant galaxy were behind
the lawson radiation spies whose purpose
was ultimately to destroy the earth before
its expanding science could reach out toward
them through the universe and so cleverly
did they cover their tracks that only through
study of the lawson radiation could their
presence be suspected at all

  the battle of wits and weapons heretofore
unknown on earth which developed was one
of the tensest and most deadly ever fought
-with continued existence of the solar sys-
tem the prize at stake

 this new novel kingdom of the
blind by george  smith should come
close to hitting the ss high spot for the year
-in a year whose high spots are more al-
tiudinous and more frequent than ever be-
fore in ss history better climb aboard

  other features will include a hall of fame

by dr david h keller and a quota of far-
above-average short stories by an increas-
ingly brilliant cast of staff writers nov ap-
proaching their postwar best the july

well the final step in reconversion of
tev is here-with elimination of that
certain non-commissioned officer a three-
striper to be exact who once ran rampant
through these pages complete with bemlins
and strange ethospheric brew after ap-
proximately six years and three different
authors the gag save in the case of very
new readers wore a little too thin and wild
space lingo unintelligible in most cases to
the writer himself covered a multitude of
sins

  however lest certain of you more temer-
ious correspondents think that the author of
this pillar has lain down and died we wish
to make certain facts known now what
some of you called the sarges humor is still
on tap-that is if his particular brand of
waggery passes as humor vitriol will still
be thrown at those who have the rashness to
insult us and anyone who writes us in dog-
gerel will get same right back in his face

  beware of bad puns henceforth as in the
past

  and now for the letters of which the sup-
ply is as copious as in all recent issues
thanks gals and fellows which gives rise
to one additional statement some of you
old timers miss the chance to sound off at
great length in your missives and be re-
printed in full

  but the days when we could run twelve
to fifteen letters and be fairly representative
of the bulk of our correspondents is past it

panion thrilling wonder stories

brief from merrie england

by p reilly

  dear sir i read your issues of ss whenever i can

set them they are rather difficult to obtain over
ere in england however i assure you that your
stories are all ok and i truly do appreciate them i
only wish we had some english magazines along the
same lines- ruchings avenue walthamstow lon-
don e  england

  thanks p reilly before the recent world
fracas there were a number of british stf
magazines some of which must be in process
of current revival you might be pleasantly
surprised if you keep an eye cocked on your
newsstands cheerio

answer-yes

by chad oliver

dear sir since the january startling was pri-
marily concerned with the efforts of one edmond
hamilton it would seem logical to start our litue

                                                      then

substantially reduced by brother edmund or ahotild
i say obliterated

hamilton has produced some fine work in ihe past
and thats all that kept me going through the first
seven chapters they were pretty sad things picked
up along about chapter seven as hamilton hit his
stride and the novel was well-done from that point
on i like his tear-jerker endings-nobody can write
them quite like or world wrecker hamilton

the best story in the book this trip was leinsters
friends it had just as much significance as the hamil-
ton opus and its simplicity was very effective murray
leinster turns out these gems with astonishing rapid-
ity

whitleys travelers tale was also a fine short

buenos tardes

by rick sneary

  buenos dies senor -just a few words about the
jan ss which im happy to say was really very
good even the cover was qs bergev really did a
good job this time a nice darls background and even
three rocket  ships of course the pie didnt match
the story but i have lumed that you cant expect to
much verdad

  star of life was a little better than the average
hamilton pulled a nice twist by letting the heroin die
i am not in favor of it as a rule but with such a for-
mula type story it made a neat ending

  venus mines inc was the best hf story you have
had sence i have been reading ss not counting
the martian odyssey which of course is in a class
by itself i whish you would tell from which issue the
story is from i would personal be very interested to
know this	 

  the two short stories were better than vept good
i am very happy to see that ss is reading the hand-
writing on the wall and turning more to this tlpe of
story in which the human emotions reather than
uhycal action play the leading role but human re-
action to an even comman avent has ana always win
be of interest so lets have more of them

  and now a few words to mr raymond hass sir
you have made a nomber of good points and from
ikc vww ot o wwwae you are quite write but you

also show a like of understanding of the human
mind first of all fans arc a different type than the
average i dont mean smart or brainyer they just
think differently without doubt  per cent of them
are helpless egoist	 

  but as a whole we are also a clearer thinking and
open minded on a lot of things we write such letter
to the pros not really to find fait but in a effort to
help the editor as a person i doubt that few fans ex-
pect to do anything but as a grupe and in mass we
reusent the thousands of people who do read stf but
havent got whal it takes to be writers

  sure we like to see are name in print who wouldn t
ill bet you got a little trill out of seeing your name
mr hass

  fans are a lot more serious minded that you would
think they appear like a lot of eve year oules acting
up to say well mr hass do you or the union be-
long to worry about the ed and last wourld war
or do you in you small way try to help such things
as federation of atomic scientist i doubt it you
would be verry suprised im sure if you could read
some letters wrlten to other fan by the same fans
you speak of

  there are of course exceptions a lot of the shorter
and duller letters are writen by people who are not
reallv fans such people as you that eather whish to
prase of deride the mag for something and to see their
name in print

  it would seam pretty obvious that editors have
found that it pays in some way by the feeling of the
letters a editor can keep ahand on the readers pulse
i as im sure any wide awake fan do not expect
that earl bergey will get sacked just becouse i say
that a cover smells i say it becouse i belive it does
alright but the reason i say it is in the hope that
bergey will try to better the next time which he
does now and then

  im sure mr hass has read the sarges plee for bet-
ter letters and i for one hope he gets them and
there is a old saying in fandom that i would like
to leave with you if you dont like the way its
done get in and do it better- santa ana st

lands of the earthquake

             by henry kuttner

   william boyce in whose veins flows the blood of crusaders
   goes on the quest of a lost memory and a mysterious woman in
   an odd clime where cities move and time stands motionless

chapter i

the crystalline window

william boyce lost a year out
of his life when he was thirty
one august morning he was walk-
ing south of the library on fifth avenue
past the stone hons that guard the broad

steps and then suddenly he was in a hospital
bed in bellevue one year later a patrolman
had found him lying unconscious on one of
central parks broad lawns boyce came
out of bellevue into hell

 amnesia was nothing new psychiatrists
told boyce that under treatment his memory
would probably return in the meantime it
would be best to slip back into his familiar

an amazing complete fulllength novel


	startling stories

grooves of life and pick up where he had
so abruptly left off a year ago

  it sounded easy boyce tried it but he
had lost all interest in his classes at the
university he was haunted he developed
an obsession he knew that he had to find
out what had happened to the lost year or
he could not go on

  occasionally fleeting flashes of memory
would come to him-a mans swarthy mous-
tached face a quiet voice he seemed to
know intimately speaking sometimes in a
language that was familiar and yet strange

  once in classics boyce heard that tongue
spoken-it was a reading from a medieval
manuscript in old french the french of six
hundred years ago but he understood it
like his native tongue that was very
strange he thought   

  then there was a memory of dark figures
robed moving with an eery litheness that
made boyce shake suddenly all over with
sheer terror that memory always snapped
shut almost instantly as if his mind would
allow him only a glimpse at such times he
wondered whether the truth about his lost
year might not drive him insane with sheer
panic

  but soiaetlung still drew him resistlessly to
that lost time he thought that it was linked
somehow with the crystal he had found in
his pocket upon his release from bellevue it
was not a large crystal but it was cut in a
way he had never seen before some of its
facets were concave others were convex it
was perfectly transparent and he felt-
uncomfortable-when he did not have it in
his pocket he could not have said why

  time passed-a year full of restlessness
and uncertainty more and more of his days
he spent wandering through the city search-
ing and searching with no knowledge of
what he sought he was beginning to drink
-too much and more than too much

  the district near the east river far south
of mid-town seemed to have the deepest
attraction for him sometimes hazy with
whiskey he would roam the silent streets
his hand in his pocket clenched on the
crystal that seemed cold against his palm
with a chill of its own never taking warmth
from his touch louder and louder more
and more insistently that silent voice from
his lost year was calling him

  rie mans dark face-that among many
things floated before him more often than
before it was not the face itself that mat-

tered he began to realize the face was
more a key to some secret than anything of
intrinsic value and it was not even a living
face but a pictured one   

  one day he saw that face in reality he
followed the man at a distance through
streets that grew familiar at last he was
left standing in front of an ancient narrow
brownstone house by the east river-indeed
its rear windows must have looked on the
river as he watched the man unlock the
door and enter the house be knew without
knowing why that this was the place which
had been drawing him for so long

  the muscles on his jaw tightened under
the stubble of his beard he crossed the
street mounted the low flight of steps and
stood waiting not quite daring to ring the
bell then scowling he thrust his finger
forward

after a moment the door opened
blind wings of panic beat in boyces
chest he thrust forward and the man facing
him gave ground his face darkening with
suspicion

  boyces gaze went beyond him he knew
this dark long hall somehow as he knew
the stairway that went up into gloom and
the other one that led down

  what do you want the man said sharply
whore you looking for

  boyce stared at that strangely familiar face

  i-my names boyce he said hesitating
you dont   remember me

  boyce sharp eyes searched his again
the quick suspicion flared heck no lis-
ten mister-just what do you want i dont
know you

  boyce felt his throat dry

  two years ago-ive changed a lot prob-
ably but not so much that you cant remem-
ber me

  i never saw you before in my life

  how long have you lived here

  ten years the man said except-

  i know this house boyce said desper-
ately over theres the living-room with
the fireplace he moved so quickly that
the other was left behind in a second boyce
was through a curtained archway and staring
around a cluttered gloomy room-a room
he knew

  his eyes went to the fireplace and over it
there hung a framed tinted photograph
nearly life-size of the dark man

  it was the photograph he remembered-
behind hit tiger-bets inning oa the tesh the htinttmm ciot to hi ttge-tnpl garment chap xv
	startling stories

not the man he whirled

  i tell you i know this house im certain
of it again the inexplicable urgency
tugged at him drawing him    where

  the dark man said look-i said i lived
here for ten years except when i leased the
place once but i leased it to somebody
named holcomb not boyce

  holcomb who was he

  i never saw the guy my lawyer handled
the whole deal i moved out and a year later
i moved back in never saw holcomb but
that was the name

  boyce stared trying to find some light in
this deeper mystery abruptly he headed for
the door and out into the hall behind him
the dark man said hey but boyce didnt
stop he knew where he was going

  as he wait down the stairs his unwilling
host called after him

  theres nothing down there its all
empty in the basement rooms mister im
gonna call the-

  but boyce was gone heightened expect-
ancy made his breath come faster what he
would find here he did not know but he felt
that he was on the right track at last that
inexplicable call was thrilling in his blood
urging him commanding him to do some-
thing he should have done long ago

  he went through a door and the room
beyond was small and dusty the splinter-
ing board walls had no windows and the
only light filtered dimly past boyce as he
stood staring it was like any other square
empty room-and yet somehow boyce sighed
a deep sigh of curious satisfaction

  this was it this was the room it was
here that   what

  he stepped out on the dust of the floor
it was so empty a room that the one thing
in it struck his gaze forcibly once he was
inside on a shelf on the wall a cheap glass
candlestick stood and in it a guttered candle
only the wax of the candle looked a little
strange it was almost clear wax a delicate
blue-green like the sky at evening so nearly
transparent that you could see the shadow of
the wick through its half-melted floor

  footsteps sounded overhead boyce went
over to the candle and touched it with a
hesitant forefinger

  i remember this he whispered ive
seen this before but the room it is and it
isnt it never was empty this way and
dirty somehow i dont think it was but
it looks  right even now

  it was too gloomy to make out details he
snapped a match into flame and then lit the
candle

  the room-it should have been a little
different richness tapestries jewels silk
stuff but it should have looked exactly like
this too how-

  the wick kindled and bloomed up in a
slow golden oval

  boyce drew his breath in a long gasp

  somethings missing he said softly
thisr

  the crystal he had carried for two years
was cold in his fingers as he lifted it in a
gesture that was virtually a conditioned
reflex he held it before the candle and the
flame struck sparks from the facets of the
stone the room for an instant was full of
shooting fireflies as the lights danced wildly
on floor and walls and ceiling boyces hand
shook

  he remembered now out of that lost
year how he had held up this crystal before
while she-she   

there were suddenly shadows upon the
walls shadows that moved and grew
stronger as boyd gazed a strange dim
richness was gathering and growing all
around him a dance of shadow-tapestries
blowing like ghosts in a ghostly wind whose
draft he could not feel dim jewels flashed
from the unreal folds

  the bare boards still rose around him
gray and splintered and dusty but a clothing
of tapestried hangings was taking shadow-
form upon the walls silently rustling in that
silent unreal breeze thicker and thicker
the shadows grew now the boards were
half-hidden behind their ghostly richness
like the bare bones of a skeleton that gath-
ered ephemeral flesh about it out of a phan-
tom-world

  with every flicker of the eandle-flame the
tapestries grew richer and more real the
jewels caught the light more clearly there
was a rug like thick soft dust underfoot
opulently patterned overhead the ceiling
billowed with dim silks like the webs of
fabulous spiders woven into flowery gar-
lands and yet behind all the richness he
could still see the naked ribs of the room
grey boards dust desolation

  boyce held the crystal to the light his
hand now steady and the candle flame
falling through it in broken refractions cast
a web of light upon the one surface of the
lands of the earthquake	

wall that was not shadow-hung but no
longer did the bare boards show there
where the light fell a crystalline pattern
formed upon the wall intricately woven in
designs as delicate and clear as the pattern
of a snowflake

  it seemed to brighten as he watched the
ghostly tapestries blew about them the
silken garlands overhead billowed but the
pattern on the wall held steady and grew
deeper and more brilliant deeper and deeper
light poured powerfully from the flame
through the crystal was strengthened as
through a lens and sank like some tangible
substance into the wall beyond it permeated
the wall dissolved it etched the pattern of
the crystal as if with some strange bright
acid that set its mark forever upon the sur-
face where the light-pattern lay

  the wind blew through the pattern   
boyce was aware of it dimly the tapestries
blew both ways from that delicately etched
design upon the wall as if the light had dis-
solved an opening into the outer air and a
breeze from another world blew through it

  it must be a breeze from another world
for he could not feel its breath

  suddenly his hand began to shake this
was impossible this could not be happening
it was hallucination alcohol-bom and he
would waken in a moment in some dingy
booth in a bar with the noise of tin-pan
music in his ears and crowds moving about
him-not with these silent tapestries that
looked so frighteningly familiar upon the
walls

  his hand shook-yes but the light upon
the wall die not shake unbelievingly he
lowered the crystal slowly the light held
steady he closed his fingers about the
crystal-it was colder than ever now with a
chill that sank into his hand-and dropped
the smooth shining thing back into his pock-
et his eyes still unwaveringly fixed upon
the wall

  the beautiful shining pattern was a re-
fraction no longer it was real it was a
great glittering design of crystal cold and
perfect as a snowflake and as fragile he
knew it was fragile how he knew it he was
not sure

  but it was the only real thing in the room
the bare bones of the walls the dust and
the splintered boards were not there at all
the tapestries were more real than he blow-
ing in a scented breeze from the crystalline
wall but neither tapestries nor the unfelt

breeze had the compelling reality of the
pattern

  there was something-he fought to grasp

it

  she had gone before him that was it
that was what had haunted him for so long
driving him along devious paths to this mo-
ment and this sorcerous room

  he could see her as she had stood here
months ago-a moment ago-time lost all
meaning as he remembered but he could
not see her face she had stood with her
back to him in this rich gleaming room a
silhouette against the great shining pattern
on the wall a tall silhouette lovely
dangerous   

  light flashed in his mind he saw as if a
shutter had snapped open the way she turned
for one brief instant and glanced across her
shoulder into his eyes

  she had smiled he saw the red lips
curve and the white flash of her teeth and
the brilliance of her eyes violet fire in the
richly-tinted face danger was in her smile
and bright blinding color an invitation and
a threat and then she had stepped forward
and-and   

  yes it had been invitation it might have
happened a year ago-it might have hap-
pened only the moment before this time
meant nothing to her she meant terror and
something worse than terror she meant
the thing his mind had gone blank to shut
away forever but where she went he must
follow

  he had completely forgotten everything
but that

  blindly he stepped forward the pattern
upon the wall loomed above him exquisitely
etched in infinities of tiny crystalline panes
beyond it he could see dim things moving
he did not care he thought they meant
danger but he did not care the bright
laughing terrible face was in his eyes like a
flash of light that blotted out all other vision
he saw nothing now but her

  by instinct he put up both arms to pro-
tect his face-and plunged blindly through
the glass

  he heard it splinter around him with a
sound like thousands of tiny musical bells
tinkling he felt their sharp edges cutting
through his sleeves he felt a gust of keen
cold air and then the world failed beneath
his feet and he was falling

  after that he remembered nothing at all

chapter ii

the huntsman

someone was laughing it sounded far
away boyce opened his eyes and looked
up dazedly at a drift of blue-grey mist float-
ing before his face beyond and above it he
could see more mist layer upon layer hang-
ing in the dim cool air and above them-
mountains-great walls of rock that van-
ished into the fog

  the laughter came again it was not far
away-it was close by and there was a snarl
in it he sat up stiffly wondering where he
was

  there was clear glass broken into glitter-
ing fragments lying all around him boyce
remembered

  but now he lay upon a shelf of stone cold
and a little damp and behind him when he
twisted to look was a grey rocky wall rising
sheer into clouds window there was none
yet he must have emerged here upon this
ledge for here lay the splintered glass of his
passage through the pattern whatever door
he had come through was closed behind him
now

  the ledge was narrow to right and left
it led downward over a trail along the face
of the cliff mist floated to hide what lay
below but before him far away over the
drifting mist a great walled city lifted its
towers and it was a curiously shaped city
he blinked through the dim air that lay
between

  clouds formed and tore apart and re-
formed over the whole valley floor but the
citys roofs rose too high to be hidden he
could see that some of them were made of
jagged rock and some of clear glass many
were of bright stuff like the roofs of tents
striped and patterned or of clear glowing
colors that billowed a little in the wind

  it was dim in the valley and he could see
lights burning among the roofs some of
them came brilliantly through the crystal
some glowed like lanterns through the
colored stuff of the tented towers the city
looked like a carnival alight with festive
lamps but there was something about it that
he did not like was it memory he wondered
or something more deeply rooted than mem-
ory-instinct itself warning him of what lay

within those high walls

  beyond them the mists rolled again over
the far reaches of the valley and beyond the
mists were more mountains they swept up
and up peak upon jagged peak range upon
rising range until the low clouds hid them

  but upon one of the foremost peaks a
gigantic castle lay boyce narrowed his eyes
against the haze and the distance and tried
in vain to make out the shape of the building
the mists between thinned for a moment
like the curtains of a stage drawing back

  he saw the great crenelated towers with
a scarlet banner like a tongue of flame blow-
ing tremendously from the topmost height
of the great donjon-keep it was a castle
such as he had seen often enough in old
pictures a mighty fortified heap of walls and
towers strangely familiar in this-this dream
this incredible land of mist and mountains

  then the clouds rolled in again and the
castle with its banner like a flame was blot-
ted out as if memory itself had revealed it
for a moment and then forgotten again or
as if the mists of the past had swallowed
forever those anachronistic towers

  boyce got slowly to his feet

  not until then did the laughter come
again deep now with amusement and a
snarl that underlay the amusement

  boyce turned the sound seemed to come
from above and after a moment the mists
drew back and he saw the one who laughed
standing on a ledge a little way up the face
of the rock with mist swirling around him
a tall man watched him boyce stared in-
credulously

  at first glance he could not be sure the
man was not actually furred like a tiger for
his long muscular limbs and lithe body were
tawny and striped with a fur of velvety
sheen but the mans grinning face was
pale and his black hair under the tiger-skin
hood lay smooth

  he was leaning back against a leather
strap lie held with both hands and boyce
could see dimly the surge of sleek bodies
around his knees the strap was a leash but
the creatures he held upon it were invisible
in the fog

  the tiger-striped mans lip lifted in a smile
like a snarl and he took one hand from the
leash to make a signal to boyce-intricate
swift motions of the fingers that were blurred
to the sight about his knees the leashed
animals surged instantly into activity and
the man laughed fiercely and seized the
lands of the earthquake	

strap again wrestling with his pack but
his eyes were questioning upon boyce

  he waited struggling with his beasts the
smile faded he made the quick cabalistic
gesture again again fought with his pack to
quiet it as he waited this time he scowled
and the scowl was scarcely fiercer than the
smile had been

  boyce lifted both hands palm out in the
universal gesture of peace it was all he
could do he had no answer for the myste-
rious sign though dimly he felt he should
know what the answer was

laughter leaped into the other mans
face instant murderous delight as if
this failure was what he had longed for
boyce thought for the fraction of a second
that he saw recognition in the pale danger-
ous countenance above him he thought the
jnan knew him had hoped for the chance at
enmity and laughed now in terrible delight
because the chance had come

   the laughter swelled to a roar triumphant
with a tiger snarl in the sound and the man
touted out a deep halloo like a huntsman
calling to his pack one striped tawny arm
flung out in a gesture of warning he was
motioning boyce to run he was pointing
down the narrow trail toward the valley and
the unseen beasts leaped about his knees
almost free of the loosened leash

  boyce turned uncertainly bewilderment
fogging his mind everything had happened
too suddenly and he was not yet sure at all
that he was not asleep and in a dream where
a tiger-striped nightmare warned him to
flee from snarling nightmares tugging at
their leash he did not like the thought of
running he did not-

  with one last halloo the huntsman slipped
the strap over the lip of rock boyce saw
smooth bodies pouring down at him five
six seven sleekly furred beasts as large as
mastiffs and as lithe as serpents one lifted
an almost human face to snarl at him

  it was a beautiful demented face half-
tiger half-cat-the strange semi-human
countenance of animal faces in medieval
tapestries but the beast was neither cat
nor dog it was something he had never seen
before circes beasts might have had such
faces

  he turned and ran

	startling stories

  the trail was steep mist blew around him
as he plunged downward never sure that
the next step might not carry him over some
unseen abyss behind him the huntsmans
laughter rang wildly through the fog the
cliffs echoing it back until the whole valley
seemed to laugh with him from the beasts
came a low deep snarling but no other
sound they might be far behind they might
be already at his heels boyce did not dare
turn to look

  the steep trail curved around the face of
the rock and leveled slowly toward the valley
floor stumbling panting dizzy with in-
credulity boyce ran on

  when the ground was level underfoot and
the drifting mist revealed to him that he had
come at last to the base of the cliffs he
paused for a moment to get his bearings
there was silence behind him even the
huntsmans laughter was quiet now and no
snarling rolled through the fog

  he stood on a sandy plain among clumps
of low-growing shrubs far off a glow of
faint color staining the mist told him where
the city lay but he was not sure at all that he
dared seek out that city he needed time to
think to search his mysteriously closed
memory for things he so desperately needed
now to know

 where was he-in what impossible land
what did he want here for he had come
through the crystal window in answer to
a compelling urge toward-something an
urge to follow-her-to find her that
nameless all but faceless woman who
wore an iron crown and whose very memory
was like a chain to draw him after her
wherever she might go

 where had he known her what had she
been to him why did the shiver of recol-
lected danger ripple over him whenever he
let her memory float back into his mind
he had no answers to these or any other
questions he only knew he was lost in the
fog of an incredible land and he did not
think he dared seek out that city which was
its only familiar landmark

  the sorcerers city its name came into
his mind blindly it was an evil city full of
strange enchantments and stranger men and
women he felt a sudden urge to look upon
it and struck out on impulse through the fog
toward a rise of ground he saw a little dis-
tance away

  from the eminence the city was clearer
veiled and unveiled by the constant silent

drifting of blue-grey clouds enigmatically
the great walls rose enclosing their clusters
of lighted towers their crystal roofs their
tented canopies that glowed like lanterns
from the lights within

  through the mists a sound came faintly to
him he turned far away winding through
the cloudy plain he saw a procession coming
toward the city there was a curious dark-
ness over the long wavering column tiny
lamps gleamed through it and the sound of
bells rose and fell as the procession wound
its way through the fog he was near enough
to make out a little of those who walked in
the line   

  boyce had no recollection of what hap-
pened next he only knew he was sitting
on the sandy ground his face in his hands
while waves of sickness receded slowly as
he sat there he was shaking all over

 he remembered then that he had seen
those-those beings-before somewhere in
her company as to what they looked like
what they were his conscious mind had no
recollection he thought he would never
know consciously they were too terribly
alien to all that is human he only knew
that they walked upright like men yet were
not men and that such revulsion went
through him at the very thought of them
that his mind blanked wholly out   

when he heard the laughter of the
huntsman in the fog he was almost
glad he got up unsteadily the dark pro-
cession with its lights and bells had vanished
into the city and the mist was empty now
the huntsman laughed again nearer at
hand and on the heels of his laughter rang
out the first cry boyce had heard from the
huntsmans pack-a high shivering scream
that made his hair prickle at the roots

  he ran

  this time the hunt was after him in ear-
nest twice he heard the pack snuffling al-
most at his very heels and the thin clear
screaming of their voices was never long
silent in the fog he ran without direction or
purpose for what seemed an endless time
with the sandy plain spinning by featureless-
ly underfoot he only knew he must not go
near the city and those who had entered it

  gradually it began to dawn upon him that
the huntsman was deliberately herding him
for the pack gave him breathing-spaces
at intervals the huntsmans halloo would
ring through the mist and the screaming
lands of the earthquake	

would die away and boyce would fling him-
self full-length upon the damp sand and go
limp with exhaustion

  if they meant to pull him down they could
have done so a dozen times in the hours
upon hours that the hunt lasted they were
herding him in some one general direction
for some unfathomable reason of the hunts-
mans own

  now the ground began to rise in jagged
foothills and boyce knew he was coming
again to mountains the pack was close
behind him he panted up a steep slope
hearing the voice of the huntsman and the
shuddering screams of the beasts echoing
hollowly through the fog

  then suddenly the ground before him
dropped away in a sheer cliff he paused
and looked frantically about if the hunts-
man had driven him deliberately to this
spot then perhaps it was with no other pur-
pose than to trap him more easily for the
kill for he could not go on or go back

  there was a new sound in the fog a dull
rhythmic clopping that was oddly familiar
boyce strained his eyes toward it trying to
quiet his painful gasping but the fog hid
the source of the noise and distorted its
sound

  a clear shivering scream from close be-
hind him made boyce swing around out of
the greyness a low lithe shape took form
lifting a snarling face to stare at him an-
other and another behind it moved sound-
lessly forward like creatures in a dream

  the clop-clopping was louder now ab-
ruptly the huntsmans voice rang out in a
high summoning shout the beautiful snarl-
ing beasts hesitated the huntsman shouted
again and abruptly the pack was gone mist
closed around them and they vanished like
nightmares as they had come

  the huntsmans laughter rang out once
more mocking edged with that inhuman
snarl then silence

  the rhythmic half-metallic noise came on
boyce turned

  out of the fog that rolled back like a
curtain from its shoulders a huge black
charger paced upon it rode a man-boyces
eyes widened-a man who had ridden straight
out of a lost century

  chain-mail glistening with moisture hung
in faintly ringing folds upon his great body
a conical helmet with metal-mesh hanging
from it framed a harsh face in which eyes of
pale blue stared unwinkingly at boyce a

sword swung at the knights waist

 another enemy boyce thought he
glanced back into the fog but there was no
trace of the huntsman or his pack

           chapter hi
           earthquake

the mounted man said something boyce
was stunned to find he could under-
stand the language not easily but it was the
old french the tongue spoken by frenchmen
six hundred years ago the words and in-
flection were archaic garbled-but under-
standable

  i am a friend boyce said slowly care-
fully i come in peace but his tense
muscles did not relax if the knight charged
perhaps he could dodge aside and somehow
wrench the man from the saddle

  if you ran from the huntsman you are
no friend of the city dogs the knight said
his harsh mouth relaxing a trifle you may
come in peace with me-at least where is
your home

  boyce hesitated what would modern
place-names mean to this archaic figure

  another land he said at random far
from here i think

  the blue eyes widened

  beyond the mountains or-not a land
of blue sky and a bright sun not a land
named-normandy

  still boyce hesitated the knight leaned
forward in his saddle

  by your garments you are no man of this
haunted world and you speak our tongue
by the rood stranger-answer do you
know paris and rome byzantium an-
swer what world do you come from

  i know paris and rome yes boyce said
through his amazement but i do not under-
stand-

  the knight clapped his gauntleted hand to
his thigh

  oh by all the gods now if you were
helot to the huntsman or servant of satanas
himself id take you to kerak with me up
-up man the pack may return or other
dangers may threaten we ride a perilous
patrol on these marches up i say

  a mailed hand gripped boyces the
	stafltling stories

american was swung up finding a seat
behind the knight the great charger well
trained scarcely stirred until the armored
man spoke a word then the horse cantered
forward picking its way delicately through
the fog

 i am godfrey morel-godfrey long-
shanks they call me came the hard firm
voice not in my memory has any man come
here from the lands of the cross we were
the last dear heaven how my soul has
sickened and lusted for a breath of clean
wind from normandy

  even the turk sirocco hell-hot as it was
would have been grateful instead of the per-
fumed stink of this abode of satanas spy
or traitor you may be-we can learn that
later but first you will tell me how the
world moves-whether we still hold antioch
and if the red lion still leads his seljuk
turks against our armies

  about to answer boyce paused as an el-
bow jolted into his ribs

  silence now for a while godfrey morel
said softly kerak is under siege it is al-
ways under siege but the fight glows hotter
of late we must ride warily and in silence

  the war-horse paced on through the thick-
ening mists boyces throat was dry byzan-
tium antioch more than six hundred years
had rolled over old earth since the banners
of the crusaders flaunted on the ramparts of
antioch

  boyce breathed deeply this was no
stranger or more fantastic than the fantastic
questions that seethed in his brain this world
was not earth-he knew that without any
question the crystal gateway through which
he smashed had led him into    what
her world yes

  but what and where he knew it did not
matter enough that it was here-the girl
he could neither forget nor remember whose
image was a scar upon his memory but for
the rest his questions must go unanswered a
while longer

  godfrey morels armor creaked and rang
beneath them the great war-horses ponder-
ous gait rocked them both to the same
rhythm himself and a man who asked after
antioch and the fate of battles six hundred
years lost and won he must not think now
of godfrey long-shanks enigma his brain
was dizzy already with unanswered ques-
tions

  the mists blew apart before them and
boyce saw high on a crag the towers and

bastions of the great grey castle he had
glimpsed across the valley the crimson
banner streamed from its keep-height
briefly through his mind went the wonder
that he had come so straight for it was that
the huntsmans doing and if it was why

  before him in the saddle he saw godfreys
mighty mailed back go rigid he heard the
crusaders caught breath then a deep-
throated shout made the mist echo around
them

  look-look at hell opening again
roared godfrey

  the horse beneath them staggered no-
not the horse but the earth itself boyce
saw a long swell of sandy ground swiftly
rising as if the plain breathed between them
and the castled heights of the mountain the
land lay bare for a moment of mist and all
that space was heaving incredibly it was
more than earthquake-more purposeful
far more sinister

then the earth split and the long jagged
rent moved horribly like a crawling
serpent toward the base of the crags that
upheld the castle

  godfrey morel roared kerak and
waved a great arm toward the castle as if
his shout could rouse the garrison to its
danger then he bent in the saddle and
drove his spurs deep the war-horse
gathered itself on the rocking earth and
staggered then leaped forward with a length-
ening stride

  boyce clutched the crusaders belt and
coughed in the dust that billowed up from the
pounding of the hoofs the whole world
seemed to be shaking now with a shifting
uneasy motion that tossed them like a ship
on water

  and there was a crawling all over the
plain a converging of the serpentine rents
as though the earth meant to swallow kerak
whole huge cracks tore themselves open
lengthening jaggedly the plain was like a
sheet of ice breaking in a spring thaw shat-
tering toward the crags upon which kerak
towered

  sorcerers godfrey howled he was up-
right in the stirrups now yelling an ancient
war-cry blindly spurring the charger across
the shuddering plain boyce hung on desper-
ately not daring to shift his grip

  before them he saw the ground yawn sud-
denly he could look down steep crumbling
lips of earth into darkness and he felt the
lands of the

stallion shudder with the shudder of the
plain then powerful muscles gathered be-
neath them were ponderously released as
the charger with its double burden hurdled
the widening gap

  dieu lo vuit godfrey breathed sudden-
ly as they thundered on across the shaking
ground it was the crusaders rallying cry
boyce knew but something in godfreys
voice told him this time it meant more-
relief prayerful thanks-god wills it

  he looked up from the heights of kerak
a flicker of light was broadening like a halo
around the topmost tower it shivered and
widened and pulsed outward as the rings
widen in water from a dropped pebble
circle after circle broadening and slowly
dropping until the whole castle was ringed
with falling wheels of fire   

  they did not stop at the base of the castle
they dropped farther ringing the crags
they came down and down slowly silently
flowing and widening as they came and ever
the topmost tower pulsed them forth anew

  where the first of the broadening hoops of
fire touched the plain the earth ceased lo
shudder-and none too soon for by then
kerak itself had begun to pitch a little like
a great castled galleon riding a stormy sea
the deep groan of rocks shaken one upon
another sounded from the tortured crags a
little more of that and kerak would have
begun to crack like the plain itself

  but the touch of the fiery rings was like
the touch of oil on angry water the earth
quieted the groaning of the cliffs fell silent
kerak was firm again upon its great grey
crags and as the showering wheels of fire
fell slowly downward in circles that broad-
ened toward the watchers the cracks in the
plain began to close

earthquake	

  wherever the moving rings touched them
the earth healed itself without a sound the
great rents were sealed like closing mouths
boyce thought of the mouths of giants
silenced but not appeased by this quiet magic
there was a feel of sullenness to the yield-
ing of the plain the rings flowed steadily
outward healing and quieting as they came
but the earth was not appeased

  in silence it yielded but it was not con-
quered he could feel that somehow in the
very silence of the place the great gaping
lips of earth closed but they closed on threats
to come they bided their time

  godfrey reined in his trembling charger
they waited while the first wave of light
lapped gently around them and went on
then the crusader shook the caparisoned
reins on the neck before him and they paced
forward sedately the stallion wading through
wave upon wave of quiet fire

  godfrey laughed a deep contented noise
in his chest

	the old mage has not lost his wisdom
kerak is still safe in tancreds hands but
the day may come- he flashed a glance
across his shoulder

  you may be a spy of the huntsman-or
worse he said or you may be an honest
man its not my part to guess there are
few places now a man could come from-
save the city if spy you are when you re-
turn tell the sorcerers that tancred is still
their match

  im no spy boyce said hesitantly
fumbling for words in the strange yet famil-
iar tongue you saw the huntsman follow
me-

  no man knows what drives the hunts-

	startling stories

bastions of kerak look up stranger feast
your eyes if you came to spy this is kerak
of the crusaders

  high high tremendous with quarried
blocks of granite the mighty bastions tow-
ered it made a man dizzy to stare up those
vast converging heights and the banner
that tore at its staff as if it fought for free-
dom with the wind made a sound of scream-
ing cloth and a flame of burning crimson
it rolled over the tremendous battlements
like a banner of fire shrieking to the wind in
a language of its own

  now you must face the oracle godfrey
said and be judged for life or death but
even if the judgment be death-by the lance
stranger you shall give me news from my
old home before you die that i have
promised myself

  the iron gates of kerak screamed on their
iron hinges and godfreys stallion paced for-
ward through the rings of falling fire and
it was thus boyce first entered kerak where
the last crusaders dwelt

chapter iv
the oracle

mist hung in the open courts of kerak
attendants in archaic garments ran
forward to help the riders dismount they
crossed a stone-flagged pavement invisible
in mist and entered a half-seen door the
cold smell of stone and the fragrance of
wood-fires closed about them as they went
down a corridor and into a great stone hall
high enough to have a drift of mist like
miniature clouds hanging in layers under
the vast ceiling

  this was a room out of another age boyce
had seen pictures of such halls many times
but he had certainly never thought to stand
in one looking down the length of the room
toward the dais at one end with a bright fire
roaring in the chimney and men and women
in the garments of six hundred years past
lounging before the blaze

  he followed godfrey over the rush-strewn
floor toward the dais there were women
there in bright velvets belted with jewels
the breath came suddenly thick in his throat
he knew no more about her than the out-
line of her body against a crystal window and
the flash of a brilliant face glancing once at

him across her shoulder but if she sat here
on the dais he would know her and per-
haps she did perhaps she did   

  a great voice rang out suddenly

  well godfrey what skulker from the
marshes dyou bring us now

  boyce started violently and paused among
the rushes staring toward the speaker he
knew the voice he knew it as well as his
own he had heard it somewhere very lately
-not with the arrogance that was in it now
but with the same inflections the same pitch
and pacing of phrase-the same voice

  godfrey took his arm and they went up
the steps of the dais and stood before the
speaker boyce staring hard

  a stranger from our own land i think
sir guillaume godfrey was saying a
stranger from home-or a spy i found him
in the marshes fleeing from the huntsmans
pack

  the man in the high-backed seat of honor
by the fire lolled at his ease glaring up at
boyce under thick brows he was a big man
with immense strength in every line of him
under the long velvet robe his tanned face
was seamed with the scars of old sword-
strokes but his blue eyes were very bright
and the mouth beneath a drooping yellow
moustache had the arrogance bom of a life-
time of command

  and it was a face boyce had seen before-
seen very recently a face of haunting famil-
iarity this was nothing out of his dreams or
his forgotten memories he knew this face

  your name stranger sir guillaume de-
manded peremptorily boyce was aware of a
sudden flush he did not like the man it
was more than any quick surface dislike
there was antagonism between the two he
saw it on the crusaders face and felt it on
his own

  i am called william boyce he said
shortly

  at sir guillaumes shoulder a black-
browed woman in green leaned forward
she was looking from the knights face to
boyces

  a moment sir guillaume she said soft-
ly i think-is it only my fancy messires
or is there a likeness here

  the others stirred in their chairs and bent
to follow her gaze but boyce understood
even as the woman spoke he knew-and the
knowledge was a flash that almost stunned
him-what lay at the root of the familiarity
in sir guillaumes face and voice this was
lands of the earthquake	

impossible-it could happen only in such a
dream as he walked in now

  sir guillaume was himself given a few
more years of age and a life-time of arro-
gance the face and the voice were his own

  guillaume was gaping at him now he rose
and glared under bent brows into boyces
eyes and they were exactly of a height blue
eyes scowled at blue eyes identical mouths
set angrily

  even to the names sir guillaume the
woman in green said he is called by your
name in the english tongue william du
boyce-

  i am guillaume du bois certainly the
knight growled still staring in the other
mans eyes but if there is likeness here i
do not admit it

  a young page kneeling on the edge of the
dais had been polishing a great norman
shield godfrey bent and snatched it up

  look sir guillaume he said

  guillaume stared for a long moment into
the mirrory steel he glanced at boyce and
then back again and his face began to suf-
fuse with rage and something like terror

  suddenly he flung down the shield it
struck the floor with a hollow clang and
above the noise guillaume roared with
anger

  sorcery by the lance this mans a
sorcerer seize him

    odfreys big hand closed on boyces
wjp arm boyce himself too bewildered to
think clearly shook it off with angry violence
the old french forsook him in his anger and
he could only shout in english

  let me go you fool im no sorcerer i-

  his voice was swallowed up in the roars
that swept over the dais as the men upon it
scrambled to seize him two of the women
screamed and the greyhounds lounging by
the fire sprang up with yelps of excitement
a moment of pandemonium reigned upon the
dais

  then above it a great deep voice rose
commandingly

  let him go messires let the man go i
say

  reluctantly the turmoil subsided boyce
looking up with the rest saw a tall man in
black robes standing in a doorway at the
head of the dais without being told he knew
who it must be-tancred the mage

  there were cabalistic symbols on the dark
robe the magician wore and his head was

turbaned like that of an eastern prince but
the face beneath the turban was not what
boyce had expected tancreds beard was
white and long but his brows were black and
met above his nose in a perpetual imperial
scowl he wore emeralds in his ears and his
fingers were heavy with flashing stones he
looked like a man who could command men
even without the power his magic gave him

  is there no peace at all in kerak he
demanded in a deep voice even while the
castle still rocks on its foundations from the
assaults of sorcery must we have brawling
on our dais

  all sorcery is not without the walls
tancred sir guillaume said loudly look
upon this man and me and judge whether
the city has not sent us another spy to-

  tancred laughed and came down the dais
slowly

  spy he may be guillaume but there
are other ways than sorcery to make two
men alike are you so certain guillaume
that no kin of yours walk the earth

  guillaume was not to be appeased

  i know magic when i see it this stretches
coincidence too far

  tancred paused before boyce pulling at
his white beard thoughtfully black eyes
burned into boyces

  perhaps it does the magician nodded
but brawling give us no answers there
are better ways of smelling out city spies
he glanced around the dais and his eye
moved past boyce and paused boyce turned

  in a corner of the chimneypiece a young
man sat huddled under a fur-lined cloak
it was not cold here and boyce saw that
sweat stood on the youths pale forehead but
he shivered from time to time under the
robe and a shaking hand clutched at the
collar to hold it close about him

  here is young hugh tancred said his
voice stem most of you know the story
of hugh of mandois he went out scouting
last week and the men of the city took him
he lived a week in the city there was
loathing in the word and hugh came back
as all our men do-whoever return from the
city his wits half addled because of the
things he saw

  tancred crossed the dais and bent above
the huddled youth

  hugh lad-hugh the boy looked up
hugh we have a question for you look at
this man here standing beside sir guil-
laume
	startling stories

  boyce met a pair of dazed blue eyes with
shadows in them for an instant he knew
that look he had seen it in the mirror in
his own eyes many times when he strove in
vain to recapture some of the memories of
his lost year that same dazed blankness
with a hint of shadows beneath

  had he himself ever walked the city and
looked upon the things that drove men mad

  tell us lad tancreds voice went on
have you seen this man before do men
in garments like his visit the people of the
city is this man a spy hugh

  hugh of mandois lifted his haggard stare
again to boyce and for an instant boyce was-
all but certain he would know him he was
all but certain that in his lost year he might
indeed have walked those streets and met
young hugh upon them

  too many strange things had happened to
him already in the past few hours for him to
feel sure of anything his likeness in face
and name to guillaume was the final straw
now he felt himself ready to believe or dis-
believe anything tancred might tell him of
himself so long as it offered a solution to the
mysteries around him

  hugh of mandois let his shadowy half-
mad eyes rest a moment longer upon boyce
then he lowered them again huddled the
robe around his shoulders and shook his
head dully

  i do not know he said in a thin voice
i do not know a shiver went over him
and he turned back to the fire

  tancreds big shoulders lifted beneath the
black robe in a shrug

  for hughs sake i wish he could re-
member he said half to himself for his
own sake i wish we could rouse him
well- he looked back at boyce specula-
tively he must go to the oracle of course
he-

  wait a minute boyce said abruptly

wlads turned murmurs rose the peo-
ple on the dais stared at him out of
angry suspicious faces guillaumes nearest
and glaring with that inner hatred which the
two men who bore the same name and the
same face had felt so instinctively for one
another

  im no spy boyce said stumbling over
the archaic french the huntsman should
have proved that-he tried to kill me but i
didnt come here by choice and i wont-

  tancred laughed

  prove your point by the way the mist
blows he said but not by anything the
huntsman does his ways are more un-
certain than the clouds still if he hunted
you here and failed to kill you be sure he
had a reason of his own

  who is the huntsman

  tancreds face darkened the black browa
wrinkled together above the black eyes
perhaps you know better than we

  all right boyce said in sudden anger
take me to your oracle then lets have it
over with whatever it may be and then ih
have some questions of my own that demand
an answer

  well spoken stranger tancred was
smiling again come

  he swung aside with a sweep of the cabal-
istic black robes and waved a commanding
arm

  boyce moved after him half doubtfully
but guillaume grinning a wolfish grin be-
neath his drooping moustache walked on
one side of him and godfrey long-shanka
stepped up on the other

  now we shall know the truth about you
spy guillaume said march

  beyond the door through which tancred
had first entered a narrow stairway rose
winding in the thickness of the wall glanc-
ing behind him boyce saw that everyone
who had been lounging on the dais was fol-
lowing them the women picked their way
up the steps delicately holding their long
skirts in ringed hands the men shouldered
after whispering among themselves hie
walls echoed with their voices and the shuffle
of feet on stone

  they went up a long way boyce began
to suspect that they might be mounting to
the top of the donjon-keep that towered
highest of all over kerak through slit-like
windows he caught glimpses of the misty
plain spread out far below of the last rings
of magical fire dying away around the foot of
the crags like fading rainbows in the fog
and across the valley the city was a blur of
colored lights veiled and revealed again as
the blue-green clouds drifted over it
the light had not changed here since his
wakening he wondered if they had day and
night in this mysterious incredible land or if
the same dim half-brightness dwelt always
over the fog and the mountains

  an arched hallway opened up before the
climbers boyce between his two guards
cleared the last of the steps and followed
lands of the earthquake	

tancreds broad back down the hall a hush
had fallen over the crowd now even their
feet no longer shuffled they walked almost
on tiptoe and he could hear godfrey
breathing fast beside him whatever the
oracle might be the castle people seemed to
hold it in something like dread

  there was a curtained doorway at the end
of the hall purple velvet hangings em-
broidered all over in a pattern of silver webs
hid what lay beyond tancred laid one big
hand weighted with rings upon the heavy
folds he turned then his eyes searching the
crowd there was a rustling among them
and one quickly drawn breath seemed to
sweep the throng

  stand forth stranger tancred said in his
deepest voice stand forth and face the
oracle

chapter v
spy from the city

the velvet curtains swept back boyce
had one moment of wonder and invol-
untary dread as he realized that guillaume
and godfrey had released his arms and
stepped quickly back so that he stood alone
facing tancred and the door then he saw
what the doorway framed and all other
thought went out of his mind

  he did not know what he had expected
certainly not this-this small stone room
beyond the curtains nor that which filled it
that delicate webbing of fire   

  it was the webbing that caught his eye
first the fiery strands were woven into a
hollow framework of exquisite pattern that
moved as he watched a living framework
-a living cage

  and in the cage of animate fire-a woman
no a figure of marble no-a woman after
all wax or marble or flesh-he could not
be sure she was not alive that much the
quickest glance assured him the cage
around her was living and fiery but the
woman within had neither life nor warmth

  she stood as a statue might stand motion-
less hands clasped before her facing the
crowd her long white robe was no whiter
than her face and her hair fell in a cascade of
pure marble pallor straight and unbroken
over her shoulders

  the face had a purity of line that seemed

to rob it of all likeness to humanity no
mortal face ever turned such flawless planes
to the beholder the eyes were closed the
lips were closed too on a lovely line that
looked as if it could never have parted
boyce thought he had never seen a figure so
coldly remote so utterly empty of life

  for a long moment there was no sound in
the hall very faintly standing this near
boyce could hear a fine thin humming from
the cage as if the fiery bars of it sang among
themselves but from the crowd came only
the silence of caught breath and from the
woman-the statue-no sound could ever
come

  what do you ask of me

  boyce had to look again to be sure the
voice had come from those marble bps they
scarcely moved the eyelids did not move
at all but surely no other lips in the world
could have spoken in such a voice of cold
remoteness such infinite distant calm a
chill went over him at the sound of that
gelid tone

  tancreds voice was soft and strangely
tender

  we have reason to think a spy may stand
here among us he said we bring him
before you that you may judge if he speaks
the truth

  no sound no motion as his voice fell
silent the marble girl faced them with
closed eyes and clasped hands not moving
even to breathe but the wait was a listening
searching wait even boyce held his breath
half-believing against his own reason that
this waxen thing could see and know and
answer-if she would

  the wait lengthened she stood there
deathly in her coldness and her pallor-no
not even deathly for nothing can die that
has never known life and it was impossible
to believe that breath had ever stirred those
marble nostrils or blood ever pulsed beneath
that marble skin

  then with barely perceptible motion the
waxen lips parted the voice that chilled the
listener like a breath of wind over ice was
clearly

  yes the man lies

  behind him boyce could hear guillaumes
deep rumble of triumph instantly hushed
an involuntary ripple went over the crowd
and he heard feet shuffle with angry im-
pulsive motion and the whine of steel half-
drawn from scabbards by quick hands

  wait the oracle said coldly wait
	startling stories

  instant hush in the silence the icy voice
spoke on

  one stands among you as envoy from the
city he came to kill he waits now to kill

 the anger among the crowd surged up
again and its rumble of fury drowned out the
thin cold voice boyce braced his feet wide
and wished ardently for a weapon

  its not true he shouted desperately
im no spy i didnt come to-

  the rising roar drowned out his voice too
and he knew one instant of that shattering
self-doubt that old wonder whether he him-
self knew what the truth might be but
there was no time for that now guillaume
with both great arms lifted and a grin of
triumphant hatred on his face was half a
dozen paces away and coming fast and the
crowd behind him was a swirl of shouting
faces and angry eyes

  wait the clear voice like an icy lash
cut through the noise in the hall the marble
girls face had not changed the lips were
parted no farther than before the eyes were
still closed but the voice had the volume
of a shout yet was still a cold thin murmur
only

  boyce saw the eyes of the crowd leave him
and fasten on the white figure in the fiery
cage they paused flushed and angry-but
they paused

  i did not name the man the chilly voice
reminded them

  bewildered murmurs answered that

 he stands among you in a guise you
know said the voice of ice he is no
stranger he is not this man before me
she paused again then with an emphasis so
biting that boyce could all but feel the sear
of cold upon his flesh she said must  name
youspy

 the thing that happened then stunned
them all boyce saw it most clearly for he
was half-facing the crowd the others had
to turn and were jostled when the first wild
sound rang upon them from the back of the
hall

  the sound was laughter

a huddled figure standing in the
mouth of the stair-door shook with
sudden desperate mirth flinging up a wild
pale face to stare at them it was hugh de
mandois the half-mad refugee from the
teitor of the city

 in the first moment boyce thought the
lad was shaken with something like hysteria

from the tenseness of the scene then he
saw the bowed body under the heavy robe
straighten-straighten and rise his eyes
refused to accept the height of the figure
they carried no message for a moment to
his startled brain he gaped blankly at that
which stood in the stairway door

  for hugh de mandois was rising to a full
stature that towered impossibly over the
highest head in the crowd the cloak fell
back the garments the young hugh had
worn were ripped and fell away and it was
no human figure that rose from the huddle
which had been hugh of mandois

  what it was he could not be sure boyce
saw it most clearly of them all and not
even he could give a name to it none of
them saw it for longer than an instant in
that brief interval the thing stood up before
them towering terrible a monstrous laugh-
ing figure mailed in something that might
have been glittering scales or glittering
armor something so strange the eye could
only translate it into familiar things like
these

  its laughter rang like a trumpet under the
arched ceiling filling the hall with sound
and then the creature leaped   

 afterward some said it fought with a
sword and some said it wielded a flame in-
stead of a blade certainly wounds were later
dressed that looked like the ripping of heavy
claws and the smell in the hall was of
scorched flesh as well as of blood for the
fight was terrible before they subdued the-
the spy the city had sent among them

 boyce fought with the rest it seemed
incredible that one being however large
could have engaged them all its speed was
that of light itself its strength beyond
imagining the strange thing was that they
did in the end after a desperate struggle
manage to prevail

  boyce remembered only the feel of cold
smooth limbs tossing him aside and falling
after him and crushing him with great care-
less blows how he fought he was not sure
bare fists seemed little enough against that
fabulous being and yet he remembered the
feel of his knuckles sinking into the scaled
body the sound of a groan as the blows
sank the reek of a scorching breath in his
face

 he remembered the numbing coldness of
an edged something sinking into his flesh the
sound of ripping skin and the hot gush of
his own blood flowing down over his chest
lands of the earthquake	

he remembered a heavy blow at the base of
the skull and after that he floated in a
whirling of stars that closed over his head in
fathomless darkness-   

  and your coming here was no accident
william boyce tancred leaned back in the
window seat and looked at boyce under
meeting brows his black eyes piercing

  boyce looked away his glance wandered
about the small stone room the canopy above
the bed in which he lay the tapestries on the
walls all of it very familiar to him now after
this long long while of convalescence he
was tired still he did not really want to
delve any deeper into the mysteries that had
brought him here

  the deep scar upon his shoulder had all
but healed by now but there was a deeper
weariness in his mind perhaps it was the
sight of the drifting mists beyond his window
changeless grey clouds rolling eternally over
a weary land

  he could see the mirages from here too
behind tancred now the unreal towers of a
mosque-like city were taking shape in the
fog at first he had thought it delirium when
he saw these visions forming and fading
again upon the mist but others saw them
too and no one could tell him certainly
whether or not the visions were wholly un-
real

  no one dares go far from kerak god-
frey had warned him the land-changes
perhaps it is sorcery that makes the pictures
in the fog perhaps they are mirages like
those we saw in the desert before jerusalem
or perhaps-dieu lo vult-these are real
things we see cities that drift like the mist
gardens and orchards going by like ships in
a sea of fog there is no way to be sure-and
return to tell of it

  he would not think of the mirages now
tancred was speaking and he would have to
listen

  i say it was no accident that sent you
among us with guillaumes face and name
tancred repeated stroking his beard with a
jeweled hand the story you tell is such a
strange one i am inclined to believe it i
believe much because of the things i know
which my companions would think rank
heresy

  he hesitated turning a ring upon his
finger then shot a keen glance at boyce lying
among the bed-cushions

  i could even guess he said what it is
that lies hidden in that lost year you speak

of but i am not free to tell you what i
suspect this much i can say-i think you
were a tool for someone stronger and less
scrupulous than i perhaps this woman you
tell me of and if you were a tool then tool
you remain

  for you have not yet performed whatever
function they meant you for and i think
you may have been chosen for that func-
tion because of your kinship with guill-
aume the black eyes narrowed that
means you see the city

  someone chose you from among all the
men of your world someone used you for a
year there in ways so terrible your mind has
closed up against x-emembering and in the
end someone made it possible for you to
follow your forgotten memories into this
land where a timeless struggle still is waged
between kerak and the sorcerers city

  he was silent awhile his face creased in
lines of worried thought his big ringed hand
moving with a steady unconscious motion
over his white beard

something in boyces mind did not
want to follow that thought it was like
an alien thing curled in the center of his
brain trying to shut his ears and his eyes to
the things tancred was saying an alien
thing some other mind reaching out from
distances across the mist to quiet his ques-
tioning keep him in ignorance of things the
alien creature did not wish him to know

  tell me he said uncomfortably not
entirely sure the words came from his own
mind and not that half-sensed invader in
his brain how did your people come here
i-godfrey asks me so many questions about
the countries he remembers and i find it
hard to answer him you see-

  tancred laughed

  i know i think i alone among us knows
the truth it has been a very long time since
we crusaders rode to jerusalem has it not
you were wise not to answer godfrey too
truthfully how long in the years of our old
world has it been william boyce

  boyces eyes met the old magicians

  six hundred years

  there was awe and weariness on the
bearded face tancred nodded

  so long then a very long time indeed
i had not realized quite how many centuries
we must have spent in this accursed land
where time stands still he was silent for
a moment again then he shrugged and said
	startling stories

you must hear the story william boyce
you are the first from our old world to find
your way through the fog to our gateway

  there have been others-a few-from
other times and lands you must not believe
yourself the only tool they of the city have
tried to use against us but you will learn
enough of that later by yourself i think

  we of kerak lived in normandy when the
day of judgment was only a little way be-
hind us he laughed perhaps you know
that when the year one thousand dawned
the world believed its end was near and the
eternal trumpet ready to call us to account
my fathers father was a boy then he told
me the story many times

   we were a credulous people in those days
ready to believe whatever men told us if
they spoke with the voice of authority well
we lived past the day of judgment but my
friends and i fell into a strange sort of
judgment of our own and we linger in it
yet and perhaps will always linger

  sir guillaume was our lord and leader
we took the crss when the crusade was
preached through normandy and rode away
to free jerusalem from the infidel perhaps
you know the story of our ride we wenta
long way for a long long time through
strange alien lands with every hand against
us we suffered much there were those of
us who died to see jerusalem

  we never saw it we lost our way liks
so many others and in the valley of hebron
we met a stranger fate i think than any
band of men has ever met before

   in the valley a castle stood and guill-
aume liking it thought to make himself its
lord that was the way we went through the
eastern lands in those days taking what we
could and holding it until a stronger man
came by so we attacked the castle i re-
member it yet-black from foundation to
battlement with a scarlet banner flying from
its donjon-keep he nodded

  yes the banner we fly today from our
own donjon a terrible banner my friend
we laid siege to the black castle for many
days we camped about its walls thinking to
starve the garrison out if we could not over-
whelm the place by force we did not guess
who dwelt there or what strange powers
he had

   one night a man came secretly to us from
the castle offering for money to lead us by
a hidden way into the stronghold we agreed
the next day we mounted and armed our-

selves and in the earliest dimness of the day
we followed the castle traitor up into the
hills where he said the entrance of the secret
way was hidden he led us from a distance
carrying a crimson banner on a stall that
we might see to follow

  many of our women rode with us all
you have seen here were in that doomed
caravan we rode and rode through winding
ways in the hills following the red flag in the
dawn we rode a long long way for a long
long while wondering why the sun rose no
higher we began to suspect magic after a
time

  i was a skilled magician even then though
i had much to learn presently i knew there
was evil in the air and i persuaded guillaume
to call a halt we sent esquires ahead to ask
of him who carried the flag where we were
going and why it took so long

  after a time the esquires came back
white-faced carrying the crimson banner
there had been none they said beneath it
the flag itself had led us flying like a great
crimson bird through the dawn we found
no men but ourselves in all those hills in
all that misty dimness

  well there was nothing to be done then
we tried to retrace our steps but we were
lost we were not to see our own land again
nor the friends we had left behind we were
never to look upon jerusalem nor upon our
homes we were not to see the blue skies
and in that misty dawn the sun never rose
again

  we built this castle here as you see it
all the land around us i think-i believe-
drifts slowly past the anchor of these hills
in those days there was a strange swarthy
people who came through the fog and traded
with us food for trinkets and labor for a
horse or two we could not speak their
tongue nor they ours eventually they ceased
to come i think their land drifted too far
away

  by then i had learned more than the
people of my own land had ever guessed at
for this is a place of strange power william
boyce for him who knows how to look and
when and where much wisdom lies open
for the taking i was able to feed and clothe
us through powers i had never dreamed of
at home this is a world of magic

  magic boyce said his voice tinged with
disbelief

  to us yes tancred nodded because
we know only a part of the laws that make
lands of the earthquake	

such things possible if we knew all those
laws it would be the science you speak of
not magic i have learned many things
here   i think that there are many worlds
and each has different physical laws what
is possible in some is impossible in others

  it may be that this is a central world
where others converge so that the lores of
many such worlds are mingled here where
there is no time and where space itself may
move because we know so little of these
alien strange sciences we call them-sor-
cery

boyce nodded he could understand
that even on earth different physical
areas had different laws-if you didnt know
the answer water boils at different temper-
atures at sea level and far above it rubber
is pliable under normal conditions but at
sub-zero temperatures it is brittle and in
death valley it melts if you know the
physical laws that caused these phenomena
you called it science

  and if you didnt know-it was magic

  you built this castle boyce prompted
then

  tancreds shrug was eloquent

  after we had finished we woke one
morning to find the crimson banner flying
at our donjon-height there is magic in that
banner but no magic i know how to combat
in a way perhaps it protects us we have
lost three men who tried to cut it down
its redness may be the blood of those who
have tried in ages past

  we never knew whose power it was that
sent us here the magician of the black
castle is another mystery among all the un-
answered mysteries of our lives and for the
most part our people have ceased to ques-
tion there is no day or night here though
we count the hours and call them days and
we sleep and call it night

  but time itself stands still there is no
way to explain that to you or how it is we
can count the hours and days and still
remain ignorant of the years something in
the air wipes our minds clean of memory
when we try to recognize time as once we
knew it this is an eternal present we
grow no older we never die of age or
sickness

  tancred sighed deeply and the stroking
hand paused upon his beard the black eyes
were veiled

  there must be ways in and out of this

world boyce said i came for one and
you say i am not the first and someone
somehow must have come out of here into
my own world and time

  tancred nodded

  there are ways after we had been
here-i cannot say how long-and after
enough wisdom had come to me i discovered
how to open the paths outside if i had
learned that sooner we might have been
saved but it was too late then two of our
men went through despite my warnings and
when they had passed the gateway they fell
into dust

  all their years came on them in the
flicker of an eye and they were in that in-
stant as they would have been had they
dwelt in their own world all the time that
had passed so we knew then that there
was no returning for us you perhaps could
go back unless you wait too long but i think
it would avail you little your problem is
here william boyce and here i think you
must fight it out

  he slept in his mind something urged
him to sleep and not to listen he was still
weary and sleep came easily and how can
a man fight the commands that rise from the
center of his own brain

  voices woke him

hush-du boyce sleeps speak softly
he recognized sir guillaumes heavy whis-
per in reply and lay quiet wondering if he
should let the two men know he was awake

  tancred apparently still seated in the
window was speaking

  guillaume youre a reckless fool you
know you must not do it

  i do as i please guillaume growled
if the plan works we may all be saved if
it fails ill suffer for it alone

  perhaps not alone have you thought
you may return to us as hugh de mandois
returned how do you know what they may
do to you if they catch you in the city
i tell you tancred i know what im
doing it will not be the first trip ive made
into the city i have my own friends there
now men who know me-or think they
do-by another name a turncoat from
kerak is a prize for the city spies theyll
buy all the information i give and beg for
more you knew my work there tancred
you never said no before why now since
hugh de mandois i feel more eager than
ever to make this attempt

  because of hugh my friend because i
	startling stories

know now how deep their powers go never
before have they worked a spy into our
midst in the very likeness of ourselves how
can we trust you guillaume even if you
do come back

  you have the oracle guillaume said
gruffly

   tancred did not speak for a moment when
he did his voice was soft and boyce thought
he heard sorrow in it

   yes he said yes-we have the oracle
very well then i see no cause for wait-
ing two attacks from the city in so short a
time must mean they plan to move upon us
with all their forces i say learn what we
can from them whatever the cost may be if
i risk my neck whos to forbid me in kerak
not you nor anyone

   you risk more than your life guillaume
tancred said

   there was no answer but a snort

   very well tancreds voice was level
you are master here

   heavy feet crossed the floor the door
opened and closed lying with closed eyes
boyce heard tancred sigh he thought of
one question that he meant to ask but it did
not seem to him that just now was the mo-
ment to ask it he wanted to know more of
the ice-pale girl whom the crusaders called
the oracle who and what she was and why
tancred spoke to her with gentleness and
heard her name with such sorrow in his
voice

chapter vi
the sleeping spell

in kerak castle time stood still but
space around it flowed slowly by now
that boyce knew he thought he could see
the slow slow ebbing past his window the
city itself tancred had told him had drifted
out of some distant foggy region into their
valley in time-no in the passage of space
not time-it would float on and each citadel
would forget the other

   but now like enemy ships passing each
other in neutral waters they were engaged
in battle and only the destruction of one-or
both-or the widening of space between
them could make an end to the conflict

guillaume had gone boyce knew it only
because he missed the arrogant deep-voiced

presence on his convalescent journeys about
the castle no one would answer his ques-
tions when he inquired after his namesake
godfrey had vanished too even tancred
had withdrawn and spent most of the waking
hours locked in his towerheight busy with
secrets of his own no man or woman in
kerak except tancred himself knew what
lay behind that tower door

  he had a pool of water there one of
the castle women whispered to boyce when
he spoke casually of the room no one
knows how but he uses it in his magic and
they say he has mirrors in his room that
show a man his own thoughts

  voices come out of the room when we
know only tancred is within and sometimes
very sweet singing like the voices of angels
and once a strange little beast bright gold
with a blue halo around it escaped under the
door and ran down the stairs the boy who
caught it burnt his hands on the halo
boyce had no way of guessing how much
time went by before the morning of the
silence it was very curious how impossible
it was to measure time in this grey world
one could make a tally of the hours and
still be helpless to reckon them up in inter-
vals of longer than a week or two time was
too slippery for the mind to grasp

  but one morning-though there was
neither night nor morning in kerak-boyce
woke to an awareness of profound silence
he sat up in his canopied bed and listened
bewildered oddly sure that it was the silence
itself that had awakened him silence and a-
sense of pressure in the air

  he dressed rapidly and ran down the
twisting stairs to the great hall of the castle
where at this hour the trestle tables should
be set up and the castle folk gathered noisily
at breakfast

  there were men and women in the hall
but they were not noisy they lay silent in
attitudes like those of puppets dropped in
mid-stage when the hands of the puppet-
master failed some had fallen over loads of
wood brought to feed the great fire that
should now be roaring up the chimney in-
stead of smouldering in sullen ash beneath
the stone hood of the fireplace

  some lay with broken dishes and spilled
food beside them the dogs stretched silent
in the rushes hawks in feathered hoods
clasped their perches along the wall rigid
as hawks of stone

  boyce stared in bewilderment over the
lands of the

silent room nothing moved-and yet it
seemed to him that the air itself was in
motion it was as if people went by him
unseen brushing his shoulder in passing
but weightless as the air they displaced
and there was a strange sweet pungent
odor in the castle-very faint nothing he
had ever smelled before

  magic he whispered to himself without
any reason whatever the smell of magic
he needed no reason for that thought it
came unbidden to his mind and he knew that
he was not mistaken

  these people were not dead they slept
he went among them anxiously shaking the
sleepers by the shoulder calling their names
no one stirred he dashed cold water in the
face of a serving wench who slumbered be-
side her pitcher she did not even sigh it
was a magical slumber and no power he
realized at last but the power of him who
had cast the spell could waken these people
from the depths of enchantment in which
they lay

  alarm grew in him as he went through the
silent castle finding no waking man or wom-
an or animal as he went only boyce himself
moved and was awake and that in itself
was frightening there was a purpose so
sure and grim behind all that had been hap-
pening to him since he broke the crystal
window and heard the huntsman laugh-no
since before that since the beginning of the
year he had lost

  in all that while he sensed now he had
been moving inexorably along some path
predestined for him by an unseen planner
nothing happened to him that did not move
him nearer whatever relentless goal the
planner meant him to reach

  today he thought he had come to a mile-

earthquake	

stone of that progress today surely he
alone of all the castle was awake for a pur-
pose not his own the air whispered with
the passage of invisible people as he went
up floor by floor searching the silent build-
ing

  tancred in the topmost tower he did not
seek until the last he was not sure about
tancred in that room of magic there must
surely have been a screen to protect the
castles wisest man from the onslaught of
the city

up and up boyce went through the
sleeping castle

  sleeping beauty he thought sleeping
beauty in the enchanted castle-a spell like
this i wonder-it might have been just
such a castle and there may be more
precedents than we know for the old tales
sleeping beauty-

  he paused on the stairs until that moment
he had not thought of the real sleeper in
this castle whether kerak waked or slept
or lay under an all-embracing enchantment
the oracle would surely stand as she always
stood locked in her strange sleep

  tancred had told him nothing of her and
the rest of the garrison folk were too much
in awe of this marble girl to say even what
little they knew ill try it anyhow he
thought ill go to her and ask-

  in the center of his brain that small coiled
alien censor seemed to stir to life weariness
that had not let him listen when tancred
spoke of certain things something was not
willing for boyce to speak with the oracle

  but this time he fought it this time he
would not surrender a deadly weariness
weighted his limbs as he climbed but he

set his jaw and climbed grimly on

 you he thought whoever you are-
this time youve got to fight

  was it that nameless formless being who
had moved him like a pawn on the chess-
board for the forgotten year in his own
world and the uncoun table days he had spent
in this had that chess-player taken up a
citadel in the center of boyces own brain

 if you have he promised doggedly
from now on youre going to have trouble
with me

  weariness was a weight like death itself
on his shoulders his eyelids drooped sleep
was in the castle brimming it from barbican
to donjonheight he was all but drowning
in it the stone stairs wavered before him
like stairs seen under water

  but the weariness in itself spurred him
on for now he knew he had guessed cor-
rectly they had left him awake for a pur-
pose of their own when they deluged kerak
with sleep but if he meant to fight then he
too must slumber while they accomplished
whatever deadly thing they planned

 he would not sleep the stairs were
mountains under his stumbling feet his
brain swam with the fragments of dreams
but grimly step by step his feet carried
his reeling body on and at last after a
time more fluid even than normal even in
this floating world the stairs no longer rose
under him

  here was the hall of the oracle and there
far away hung the purple curtains netted
with silver threads far far away down
an endless corridor that dissolved before
him   

  he had no memory of walking that hall
he knew his relentless body must have
carried his spinning head forward but he
did not know at the time what went on he
only knew at the last that something soft
touched his outstretched hand waking him
out of a troubled nightmare

  for this moment at least he was his own
man again sharply and clearly the world
came back into focus and he was awake once
more the castle still brimmed all around
him with sleep and the smell of magic and
the air now and then swirled as if invisible
beings went quickly by but boyce at last
was vividly alive

 he put out a firm hand and pulled the
curtain back

  there was the cage of fire alive and softly
humming with its own vitality-and within

it the marble girl it had not occurred to him
to wonder if he would find her here to his
mind she was as fixed as a statue in her
niche and he was not surprised to find that
so far as the eye could tell she had not
moved or breathed or spoken since that hour
in this same hall when the hand of the enemy
had last fallen upon kerak

  now in the presence of the enemy again
with the hall swimming in alien magic boyce
stood quiet breathing hard and waited

  it seemed a long while she stood facing
him ice-pale hands clasped before her her
ice-white hair and ice-white robes falling in
unbroken lines to her feet he felt a mo-
ments almost irresistible temptation to put
out an exploring finger and touch the robe
the clasped hands to learn if he could
whether she and the robe were of the same
marble if this were a statue or an image of
half-living wax or a woman incredibly
empty of life

  he did not quite dare he stood watching
the closed eyes the closed lips with their
line of pure flawless beauty as inhuman as
the beauty of a stone image and he saw
almost imperceptibly the lips part

  what do you ask of me the cold clear
distant voice inquired

  and for a moment hearing that voice he
was struck as he had not been struck before
by his utter loneliness here it took this
voice from the chill inhuman lips to remind
him most clearly that he was the only living
waking human in kerak-unless tancred
had been spared

  all around him the air flowed with hostile
magic the castle was a great chalice brim-
med with sleep a tomb for the half-dead
slumberers whose lives hung upon the caprice
of the conquering city only he stood here
alive and awake and all his hopes were
pinned on this marble being which wa
surely neither awake nor alive

  tell me what to do to save kerak he
said his voice a little unsteady

if she understood she gave no sign he
was assuming somehow that she knew
what was happening around her that the
closed eyes did not need mortal vision to tell
that closed and marble brain of keraks
danger he wondered if she cared at all

  in the silence watching those closed lids
he thought the air had begun to shake a
little to a deliberate rhythm it was the
faintest possible pulsing through the hall
lands of the

but his senses were strained to their highest
pitch just now and he was almost sure of
what he heard

  then the oracle spoke

  hear me she said in that clear indiffer-
ent voice hear me there is one who
comes to kerak

  now he was sure the strong rhythm beat
out its measure and the air quivered in
response someone was left alive then after
all someone who-who marched upon
kerak for the rhythm was like the tramp
of heavy feet measured relentless coming
nearer with every succeeding beat

  one man comes the oracle told him
the magic comes before him he is a man
who must die or kerak dies she paused
then with chilly indifference she said the
mans name is guillaume du bois

  tancreds door vjs studded with iron
tars boyce paused before it hand lifted to
knock and listened to the heavy beat like
thunder in the air that echoed the footfalls
of the man who was coming to destroy
kerak he could still not quite believe what
the oracle had told him

  his own queer spontaneous hatred for
guillaume made him distrust his own re-
actions the thought of killing guillaume-
if he could-was a dangerously exhilarating
thing but guillaume had gone out to risk
his own life for keraks sake and guillaume
was keraks lord

  his knuckles on the star-studded door
made hollow echoes that rolled down the hall
behind him there was no sound from be-
yond the door he knocked again and
waited while the coming footfalls of-
guillaume-shook the air through all of
sleeping kerak

  then boyce lifted the latch of tancreds
door and pushed it slowly open

  a curl of rosy smoke drifted past him as
the door swung back it smelled of flowers
fanning it away from his face boyce looked
into the room which no eyes but tancreds
had ever seen since the builders left six
hundred years before an hour a day a
century-time had no meaning in kerak

  this was a room of magic but its magic
had not saved the man who lay here fallen
forward across a low table with his head
resting on his arm and his white beard
streaming across the carved edge of the
table with all of kerak tancred slept
on the painted surface before him a heap of

earthquake	l-

silvery ash in a black dish smouldered
slowly giving out the flowery smoke that
floated in layers through the air it shud-
dered rhythmically now to ihe increasing
footfalls of him who walked toward kerak

  tancred boyce said hopelessly tan-
cred

  to his amazement the lolling head moved
a little very slowly with infinite effort
the big shoulders drew themselves up and
the magician rolled his head sidewise slight-
ly and groaned

  boyce found himself on his knees beside
the low table shaking tancreds shoulder

  can you hear me he demanded tan-
cred are you awake

  he was not awake but neither was he
wholly asleep somehow in the few moments
between the coming of the magic and the
conquering of kerak tancred had managed
to perform some averting spell which partly
nullified the -effects of slumber probably
boyce thought it was this smouldering ash
that filled the room with rosy layers of
cloud and the fragrance of flowers

  tancred he repeated can you hear
me

  this time tancreds eyes opened a little
and his black eyes looked out through a
film of sleep into boyces face it was as if
the mage looked at him through a curtain
standing alive and wakeful and impatient
behind the veil which he could not lift

  shall i trust the oracle tancred boyce
demanded urgently shaking the black-robed
shoulder theres a spell over kerak-you
know that the oracle tells me i must kill
guillaume does she speak the truth tan-
cred

light came briefly into the half-lidded
eyes of the mage the bearded lips
stirred tancred made a mighty effort to
break the bonds which magic had forged
upon him boyce saw the veins stand out in
his heavy neck and the dark face which the
suns of the holy land had tanned too deeply
ever to fade grew livid with strain

  but he could not speak the bonds of
sleep were too heavy he gave one last
convulsive effort that lifted his head a little
way off his bended arm and boyce saw him
nod-once twice it was enough he had
his answer

  then the magicians breath ran out in a
sigh and he collapsed again in slumber upon
the table top while the futile flower-smelling
	startling stories

smoke wreathed about him unnoticed

  kill guillaume boyce heard himself
saying softly in the quiet room

  the air shuddered around him no-this
time not the air alone the floor shook
underfoot there was the sound of heavy
boots on stone and each footfall made the
whole of enchanted kerak tremble to its
foundation

  suddenly boyce felt his heart beginning
to thud in quickening beats that matched
the approaching steps the breath was thick
in his throat and exultation filled him as the
enchanted sleep brimmed in kerak castle
his hatred for guillaume was a tangible
thing he knew now in a flash of under-
standing that he had lived every hour in
kerak toward this one moment-toward the
killing of guillaume for that purpose it
seemed to him now he had been born and
lived to this one exultant hour

  there was no reason behind it dimly he
knew that it must have been foreordained to
happen so-or why was only he awake in
kerak when the destroyer came but he
would not think of it now he would not try
to reason why keraks lord had come back
to kerak as its destroyer reason was not
in him hatred was all that remained and
the exhilaration of battle

  the footsteps like the tread of a giant
shaking the stairs they mounted were very
near him now the air was thunderous with
its echoes of that tread dimly boyce thought
there were moving shapes about him brush-
ing his garments as they went invisibly by
he had no time to wonder

  there was a sword lying across tancreds
table close by his limp outflung hand boyce
snatched it up stripped the sheath away
balanced the great blade in his fist and is
he did so a sort of electrical shudder ran up
his arm from the hilt and tancred lying
across the table behind him stirred and
sighed the sword moved of itself in boyces
grasp it made an arch through the flower-
scented air and brought itself up into posi-
tion

  it was a magical sword he knew then

  laughter sounded in the hall deep wild
laughter that was not wholly guillaumes
more subtlety was in the sound than guil-
laume had ever known then for the first
time since enchantment had fallen upon
kerak boyce remembered hugh de mandois
and how strangely changed he had come
back to the crusaders

          chapter vii
          false crusader

the star-studded door flew open with a
crash that echoed and re-echoed in
tancreds tower-room the rosy smoke-
layers swirled wildly guillaumes great
bulk filled the doorway he was laughing
as he came in deep shaking gusts that boyce
thought must ring through all of the silence
and the magic that brimmed kerak

  guillaumes huge sword bare in his mighty
scarred fist flashed in the dim air of the
chamber his face was not mirthful though
he laughed it was his mouth alone that
laughed his eyes had the veiled look that
tancreds showed a shadow was over his
arrogant stubborn face and it was a terrify-
ing shadow

  tancred guillaume roared in a voice
that should have wakened every sleeper in
the castle tancred this is the hour you
die

  he took one ponderous step forward-the
whole room shook to that inhuman tread-
and the great two-edged sword swung up
over the mages head

  in some remote comer of his brain boyce
knew suddenly and certainly that this was
not the true guillaume the enmity between
them was an enmity of the blood a bond like
kinship which neither could have broken
by himself

  the guillaume who had left kerak would
never have ignored boyce standing here
with a sword in his hand to roar threats at
a sleeping tancred no-this guillaume was
not the same man who left the castle

  of its own will the blade in boyces grasp
swept up in a glittering arc and it rose not
an instant too soon guillaumes sword was
already falling and in another moment the
mages head would have rolled from its
shoulders across the painted table

  there was a clash in mid-air like the clash
of meeting thunder-bolts fire sprang out as
steel screamed against steel guillaume thun-
dered a ponderous curse in a tongue boyce
had never heard before the tongue they
speak in the enchanters city he wondered
wildly and the great blade rose again
shearing through the wreaths of colored
smoke above tancreds head
lands of the earthquake	

   	was a strange battle they were iron
 men in the days of the crusaders the mighty
 swords they swung were so heavy a modern
 man could scarcely lift them in both hands
 magic alone made it possible for boyce to
 meet the terrible crashing blows guillaume
 was raining upon his blade magic and the
 cunning of the sword which fought of its
 own enchanted will-and the fact that guil-
 laume never once really turned his blows
 against boyce himself

   guillaume-walking in magic and with the
 shadow on his face that was not wholly the
 face of guillaume-had come for one purpose
 only to kerak he had come to kill tancred
 the mage all his sword-strokes were bent
 upon the sleeping tancred it was boyces
 part to keep the steel shield of the magical
 blade between guillaumes and the magician
 he did not have to fight to protect himself
 but the fight to protect tancred was a des-
 perate battle indeed

  lightning leaped through the chamber
whenever the great blades screamed across
one another and guillaumes footsteps
thundered impossibly upon the flagstones
every tread shaking the whole castle he
was more than a man-he was a sorcerers
godling walking in thunder and wielding
the lightning but he fought blindly and
he walked blindly and it was not guillaume
behind that arrogant shadowed face

  the end came suddenly boyce knew he
had no part in it he felt the blade he
wielded shift itself in his grip leap as if
with abrupt triumph and dart at last in a
flickering lateral stroke that snaked in under
guillaumes blow and struck the crusader
hard edge-on against the corded thickness
of his neck

   it was a clean blow it should have lifted
 guillaumes head clear of his shoulders but
 it did not sparks leaped out as if the blade
 had struck steel instead of muscle and flesh
 there was a dazzling coruscation of jagged
 lights and a ringing sound like a gong
 struck heavily and guillaume cried out in
 a strange breathless voice dteu lo vult
 diett- as if that blow were what he had
 prayed for

   then everything shifted inexplicably in-
 describably before boyces eyes the cham-
 ber that yet rang with lightning and thunder
 from the battle of enchanted blades fell
 suddenly silent guillaume was falling

  he fell slowly the two-edged sword
dropped from his slackened grip and clanged

 upon the flagstones he sank to his knees
 and very deliberately seemed to float forward
 until he lay face-down upon the floor boyce
 heard the great sigh he gave as he col-
 lapsed

   it was as if deafness had suddenly been
 lifted from boyces ears then-for kerak
 castle awoke

   and on the painted table tancred sighed
 and stirred all through the castle beneath
 them were stirrings and startled voices as
 the slumberers awoke the air no longer
 shuddered to every motion guillaume made
 he was a normal man again with only a
 humans powers and looking down at him
 boyce was surprised-but not entirely sur-
 prised-to see that from his neck a broken
 collar hung

   it was a collar of glass

   tancred rose boyce turning to face him
 saw that the magician was breathing heavdy
 as if he and not boyce had fought that battle
 of the enchanted swords sweat was bright
 upon his brown forehead above the meeting
 brows and his great chest heaved

   it uxis you boyce said softly holding
 out the sword

   tancred nodded he was still almost too
 breathless to speak he took the weapon
 from boyces hand and drew a finger down
 the length of the blade and boyce saw
 something-some brightness some strange
 aliveness-fade and go out in the wake of
 the moving finger

   yes tancred said but without you i
 must have failed my thanks to you du
 boyce he slid the sword back into its
 scabbard and dropped it on the table now
 as for him he said nodding toward the
 prostrate guillaume -as for him-i won-
 der

 he dropped to one knee beside the
 fallen man reached out a cautious
 finger to the shattered glass collar which
 had stopped that deadly final blow he
 touched it-and there was a clear ringing
 sound like a wineglass shattering the collar
 leaped of its own volition and flew into a
 glittering powder and was gone

   guillaume stirred and moaned

   gently tancred turned the crusader over
 guillaumes head fell back and his thick
 throat worked convulsively

 i-it was not i tancred-they sent he
 whispered

 i know guillaume no matter now
	startling stories

youre safe

  guillaume scowled and shook his head a
little with infinite effort no-not safe
godfrey-i must go back-

  tancred laid a ringed hand over the cru-
saders mouth

  hush guillaume you were possessed
you have no strength left even to tell us
what happened wait

  he rose wearily boyce watching was
aware now for the first time of the strange-
ness of this tower-room until this moment
he had been too preoccupied with the urgency
of what was happening to see any more than
the essentials of the place now he saw-the
magical things

  there was the pool the castle woman had
whispered of it lay in a little alcove on the
far side of the room round framed in
bright tiles and a tiny tide of its own surged
slowly outward in rings from the center of
the circle and magic hung over it boyce
could not have said why but he could sense
it in the air above the pool

  shelves lining the walls were thick with
things boyce had no name for he saw
books in many languages some of them
he was sure not earthly languages a harp
hung on one wall its bright strings rippling
a little now and then as if invisible hands
stroked them giving out the faintest possible
humming music almost below the level of
hearing and in one louvred box in a cor-
ner he thought he caught a flicker of motion
occasionally as if some small being moved
inside

  tancred took a crystal goblet from a shelf
it was empty when he touched it but by the
time he had turned and bent to guillaume
the goblet was half filled with something
translucently red and pungent-smelling

  drink this tancred said kneeling and
lifting guillaumes head the crusader
obeyed he seemed too exhausted to move of
his own will or to question anything the
mage might say it was an unnatural ex-
haustion there was about it something al-
most like the utter emptiness of the oracle

  but after he had drunk a little life came
back into his face he lifted himself weakly
on one elbow and looked up urgently at
tancred his voice was scarcely more than
a whisper

  godfrey- he said prisoner-in the
city help me tancred i must go back to
him

  your strength is very little guillaume

tancred told him it will not last long tell
us what happened while you can
guillaume closed his eyes for a moment
before he spoke

  we went into the city as we had planned
i met my-my acquaintances there they
were eager to buy the secrets i offered them
we bargained i-knew there was one close
to the councils of the sorcerer king i waited
for him-too long i never saw his face but
his name is jamai-he is a very evil man
guillaumes voice faded he waited gath-
ering his strength and then went on in a
weaker voice

  there are-factions in the city the
king-would not destroy us utterly he
hates us tancred but for some-strange
reason-he would destroy us one by one
not all together and kerak with us jamai
is his chief enchanter he hates us too and
he has no scruples

  do you know tancred-there is a bond
between kerak and the city some bond
that keeps the city from drifting on its way
the lands do move the city has its course
like a ship jamai would be off on that
course he longs to cut the bond whatever
it may be that holds them here

  tancred nodded

  i think i can guess what it is

  he-will destroy kerak guillaume went
on all this was-his doing the king-did
not guess i was mistaken about jamai i
tried to bargain-secretly he took us both-
godfrey and me i must go back for him
guillaume was silent for a moment and his
eyes clouded as he looked back into the past

  he is hostage he said for my success
here i must release him tancred he lies
in-a strange prison strange-i cannot tell
you how strange

  how was this magic done tancred
asked do you know that

  guillaume nodded weakly

  the collar he said i would have sworn
it could not be-that i should wear the collar
of a master but i wore it and the spell-
was simple sleep ran out before me-as i
came it was not i   i think jamai-or his
mind-rode mine as a man rides a horse
he saw through my eyes until the collar
broke-it was not i

  he struggled to sit up

  now i must go back he said god-
frey-

  tancred put out a hand and pressed him
back
lands of the earthquake	

   one will go for godfrey he said not
you guillaume but godfrey shall be saved
if mortal man can save him rest assured
of that

  guillaume was not to be assuaged so
simply he lay back in obedience to tancreds
hand but his eyes were fiercely questioning

   who the voice was only a breath

   across the crusaders body tancreds eyes
met boyces

   the answer to your problems du boyce
does not lie in kerak he said i have
known that for many days will you seek it
in the city

   startled boyce glanced at guillaume
meeting the glare of his own eyes looking
back out of that arrogant face so much like
his

   you can serve yourself and us tancred
went on if you take up the links of guil-
laumes plot i think you may find your way
more easily than if you go alone for only
you can go-as guillaume

blue mist swirled about his knees as
he walked slowly across the sandy
plains between kerak and the sorcerers
city boyce drew the blue cloak about him
more warmly for this air was damp and
cold beneath the cloak he wore tunic and
hose from the store-rooms of kerak and
across his chest the red cross of the cru-
sader blazed

   it was the cross men wore who had set
their faces toward jerusalem six centuries
ago none in kerak carried the cross upon
their backs to proclaim the pilgrimage com-
pleted though all but tancred still cherished
the hope of doing so for them time still
lingered where they had left it to step into
this cloudy oblivion in which no sun rose or
set

   boyce touched his face experimentally for
the hundredth time he was not yet sure how
tancreds skill had managed to engrave there
the arrogance which marked guillaumes
most sharply in contrast to his own the
drooping moustache of the crusader was all
that remained of the golden beard which had
grown during the days-the weeks the
months perhaps-of his convalescence to
the eye he passed as guillaume

   and he was going deliberately-like a fool
he thought-into the same trap which had
sprung on guillaume he wondered a little
why he was risking so much for the sake of
these people who were nothing to him except

exiles from the same world true they had
taken him in he owed them gratitude for
that

  but he went into dangers now too deadly
 to have names remembering hugh de
 mandois he shuddered to be possessed by
 a scaled demon such as hughs-to be ripped
 apart like a garment body and bone when
 the demon chose to stand forth   

   no he had no duty to the crusaders that
 could force him to risk a fate like that he
 risked it of his own will he risked it be-
 cause of-gratitude-kinship he knew it
 was not true he would have gone if kerak
 had never stood here on its crags if godfrey
 and guillaume were dust in the world of
 their birth

  he must have gone and he knew it-be-
 cause of a woman whose face he did not
 know a woman who had looked briefly over
 her shoulder at him in a fragment of memory
 and smiled beneath her iron crown

   she dwelt he thought in this city before
 him tancred had told him that much and
 tancred had told him of the bond which
 linked kerak to the city

  you have wondered about the oracle du
 boyce tancred had said an hour ago sit-
 ting in a high-backed chair in his tower
 room and turning a cup of wine in his
 jeweled fingers before you go i think you
 must hear all i know of her story she is-
 he hesitated looking down into the wine
 she is the child of my only child tancred
 said finally

   boyce straightened in his chair muffling
 an involuntary sound of amazement

   then she is alive he said i thought-

   alive tancred sighed i do not know

 i have learned much about science and about
 magic since we came to this land and i have
 seen much in my mirrors of secret things in
 the city but about this one thing i know
 almost nothing i know only that some
 terrible wrong has been done and i think it
 is resolved for good or evil the bond will
 always hold between kerak and the city
 unless one or the other is destroyed   

  he sipped his wine

  drink he urged boyce you will need
 strength for your journey the lands be-
 tween here and the city walls are cold and
 the mist is like floating rain drink your
 wine and listen

  the city was much farther away from
here when my daughter who had come to us
from normandy on the crusade rode out one
	startling stories

 day and lost herself in the mists it was
 the last we saw of her for a long while
 his face grew grim the black brows meeting
 above the black eyes

  those of tlie city took her he said after
a pause the sorcerer king beheld her and
because she was beautiful he kept her in his
palace he had many slaves to do him full
justice i relieve he held her in high honor
she was a very lovely woman she bore one
child to him-a daughter then she died

  i have never known how perhaps poison
perhaps the bowstring or some more mys-
terious way or perhaps she sickened and
died of her illness i never knew i saw her
but once before her death-briefly outside
the city walls

  the child lived on in her fathers palace
and grew and became a woman it is very
strange that- he shook his head the
emeralds glittering in his ears beneath the
turban time goes so differently there and
here i think time moves and is counted in
the city

  i know my daughters daughter grew to
womanhood while here in kerak there was
no time at all young pages among us now
were young pages before my grandchilds
birth and now she-she stands in her fiery
bower a woman grown

  he poured more wine

  what happened in the city i do not know
she was her fathers favorite and i think
some quarrel came up between them and
for punishment perhaps he made her as
she is now

  i only know she came to us like a ghost
like a marble woman walking with closed
eyes and clasped hands white as snow and
as silent some instinct seemed to lead her
to her kinsmen when she could no longer
endure the city of her birth

  we took her in and tried to tend her but
she asked only for a room in which she
could dwell quietly we gave her the room
you have seen and when we came in the
morning she stood as she stands now in that
cage of singing fire she spoke to us from it
with the voice of an oracle

  there is much power in her with those
closed eyes she can see into mens souls
wisdom is in her but locked behind that
silence

  she is not always caged there are times
when the fire dies down and vanishes and
then she walks from the castle into the mist
and is gone awhile i think-i cannot be sure

but i think she meets someone down among
the plains but always she returns to her
room and the bower of fire takes shape
around her again

  it is my belief that so long as she dwells
here the bond between her and her father
the kang of the sorcerers city will anchor
them to us as a ship is anchored and if
what guillaume tells us is true the king
will not have all of kerak destroyed while
his child remains here he would gladly kill
us all-but not his daughter

  that is why i think there is hope for your
mission to the city if jamai who is the
kings minister were king himself my hopes
would be small i can tell you no more than
this as far as i may i will watch you it
may be i can help but i think you came
here for a purpose-led by what magic i
cannot guess-and i am sure the answer to
your coining lies in the city

  he drained his cup again

  do what you can for us there du boyce
remember you have a link with us in kerak
too your likeness to guillaume is no acci-
dent

ja faint drift of music through the
mist roused boyce from his thoughts
he looked up above him loomed the high
walls which he had first seen from that gate-
way through the solid rock when he broke
his way into this world lights gleamed
from the heights of the wall he could hear
the tented roofs billow a little in the breeze
from the plains and the fog was stained with
bright colors where the glow fell upon it

  boyce turned and went left along the base
of the wall there was a small gateway he
must find marked with a circle of blue
lights guillaume had told him it was a pil-
grims gate guillaume said the drifting city
was for many in this unstable land a holy
city filled with altars to gods that bore
strange names pilgrims from far away over
the plains sometimes came here by twos and
threes by caravans sometimes alone

  guillaume had told boyce the word that
would let him in

  say you come to worship nain he said
you need only that one name-nain many
of the pilgrims do not know the tongue the
city speaks so you will not need to know it
you can make yourself understood the
people of the streets speak a patois of which
our own french tongue has become a part
in the long time we have lived in kerak
lands of the

  he hesitated a look of bewilderment over-
spreading the exhaustion of his face but he
did not think that idea through it was as
well

  kerak and the city must have lain an-
chored together on the drifting lands for
a long time indeed if the old french had
incorporated itself into the street patois

  you must ask the way to nains temple
guillaume went on one will meet you
there when you have done as i told you
after that- he shrugged dieu lo vult

  a gateway in the wall loomed up at boyces
right it was closed upon the panels a
painted face with staring yellow eyes re-
garded the fog boyce went on by trying to
shake off the illusion that the eyes rolled to
watch him pass

the next gate was open but the insignia
painted on the back-flung leaves was a
standing dragon and something about the
scaled picture reminded him forcibly of that
monstrous thing which had cast aside the gar-
ment of hugh de mandois body in the hall
at kerak he wondered what he might find
if he went in at this gateway-wondered if
it was here that hugh had entered-and
passed quickly by

  the third gate was closed a ring of blue
fights glimmered on its panels boyce stood
before it in the rolling fog drew a deep
breath

  this was the gate under this arch he must
enter the enchanted city and find the answer
to the questions which had driven him so
long and so far

  he slipped his hand into his belt and
touched the one thing he had brought with
him from the outer world-that small cold
crystal which had cast its web of light upon
a wall and opened a window for his entrance
it lay there against his side hard cold with
a faint chill that struck through his clothing
it was his only link with her-nameless and
faceless-and the lost year he had sought
so long

  perhaps he might find his answer soon

  he lifted his hand and knocked faintly
upon the gate there was a long silence
then with a sighing of hinges the blue-lit
door swung open

  music drifted through it and someones
light laughter from far away

  boyce squared his shoulders and stepped
forward

  he entered the city of sorcerers

earthquake	

           chapter viii
           the called bluff

        eraks quarrel guillaume had
m said is with the sorcerer king
and the men about him the common folk
of the city know little about us and care less
you can go safely among them-or as safely
as anyone may go who enters for a pilgrim-
age that is not very safe du boyce go
carefully

 the man who looked out of the opened
gate bore out guillaumes warning he was
a swarthy small man with shifty eyes and a
bandage around his head he gave boyce
a look of indifferent dislike and said some-
thing in a tone of bored inquiry

  boyce said nain

  the gatekeeper nodded and stood back
boyce bent his head under the low archway
and stepped into the street within

  it was a narrow street walled by high
narrow houses colored lanterns hung here
and there from upper windows and the pave-
ment was wet with fog reflecting the lamp-
light a curious city boyce thought in which
it must seem always just dusk with the first
lamps lighted in the streets

  this was a street of music and merrymak-
ing to judge by the sounds that came from
the windows he passed most of them were
set with tiny diamond-shaped panes that
distorted the scenes within but he caught
glimpses of confused colors and shifting
bodies and heard laughter and the smell of
wine drifted from every open door there
was strange wild music that sent its rhythm
echoing involuntarily through his mind

  the people on the street were a mixed lot
tall fair men in striped robes that billowed
around their long strides-short men red-
skinned in turbans and tight-fitting coats-
women with perfectly transparent veils
across their faces who smiled indiscrimi-
nately upon every passerby-women the
color of polished ebony who wore broad-
swords and swaggered as they walked in their
scarlet tunics down the middle of the street

  boyce tall and fair-haired in his blu
cloak and scarlet-crossed tunic had no
reason to feel conspicuous in that crowd no
doubt there were symbols upon the garment
of many others with meanings as esoteric as
	startling stories

those on his drawn perhaps from the worlds
as unknown here as earth

  he passed a little man in grey rags who
carried a striped paper lantern over his
shoulder on a long stick and touched the
mans arm saying nain

  the man smiled at him and nodded up the
street indicating a turn at the next corner
boyce thanked him in english grinned to
himself to hear how fantastic the familiar
tongue sounded in this dim wet street and
went on

  twice more he asked his way once of a
grim-faced woman wearing a horned helmet
and a green velvet robe that swept the
ground once of a man in armor whose plates
glinted like mirrors in the light of the colored
lanterns on the third try he found the
temple he sought

  it was a big stone building lightless with-
out windows standing in the center of a
square the streets parted around it flowing
noisily with colorful crowds but the temple
of nain maintained its austere silence even
in the midst of that rioting crowd

  boyce climbed the grey stone steps and
paused under the archway at their top to
look down a long room that twinkled around
its walls with row upon mounting row of
colored globes thousands upon thousands
of them each burning in its paper lantern
upon shelves that lined the walls there
were others here a throng as motley as the
street crowds strolling and whispering
through the big empty room if there were
ceremonies in honor of nain evidently they
had not yet begun

  boyce went straight down the room to-
ward a translucent wall at the far end
guillaume had said there was a magical
tree growing there he found it was a tree
of glass espaliered fiat against the crystal
wall clusters of luminous richly colored
fruit dangled within the worshipers reach

 calmly boyce reached up and pulled a
round blue fruit the size and shape of a pear
it vibrated in his hand for a moment as
alive and resilient as something of blown
glass then there was a tiny exploding
sound and the fruit vanished leaving only a
drop of blue moisture in his palm

 someone touched his arm from behind
he whirled a little too quickly it was a
brown girl barefooted bare limbed with
gold bands on her wrists and ankles and a
heavy gold collar locked around her throat

 she said come in the old french

spoken with an accent that might be the
city patois and led him back down the room
toward a side door they came out upon
another street lined with great crouching
stone beasts that shone with the moisture of
the fog

  the beasts had lanterns around their necks
and the crowd went by under their stone
jowls in the swinging light of the lamps
the brown girl beckoned to boyce and then
hurried down the steps on soundless bare
feet and plunged into the throng

 there was something wrong with this
crowd he was not sure just what but he
saw how the people kept glancing over their
shoulders uneasily their noise was a little
hysterical now sometimes they looked up
into the misty sky and presently boyce heard
a thin shrill keening overhead that was
louder than the noise of the crowd and grew
louder still as he paused to listen

  the effect upon the people was electrical
faces turned up suddenly pale in the un-
certain light of the lanterns there was a
little echoing moan that seemed to run like
a breeze over the whole crowd a sound com-
ing in one breath from every throat there
and then like magic the crowd began to
melt away

doors opened all along the street to
receive them here and there someone
beat impatiently at closed panels calling in
a low voice to those within no one called
loudly it seemed to boyce that within a
moment after the first shrilling sounded from
overhead there was no one left upon the
street

  the bright crowd had scurried by under
the stone images and then in a twinkling
the wet street was empty except for a strag-
gler or two who glanced curiously at boyce
standing there alone and then vanished into
the nearest shelter

  there was a patter of feet on stone boyce
looked down the brown girl was motioning
impatiently to him

  come she said urgently come-hurry
theres no time

  he went uncertainly toward her over the
wet pavement it was not fast enough to suit
his guide she swooped down on him seized
his arm and pulled him along at a run
toward a door behind one of the stone beasts

  what is it boyce demanded i dont
understand-

  they come the girl said hurry in
lands of the earthquake	

here-quick before they reach this street

  the door creaked on its hinges within
was darkness and boyce remembered guill-
aumes warning to go carefully he held
back a little not sure whether it would be
more dangerous to enter or to stay outside

  then from the street before him a little
breath of cold air blew past fluttering his
cloak it was a cold that seared like heat
and terror came with it-terror and such a
revulsion as he had not known since the
moment in the fog when he first came to this
land and saw from a hilltop the dark proces-
sion winding down toward the city gates

  it was they indeed-those who walked
among a twinkle of lights and a twinkle of
tiny bells and a cloud of darkness that veiled
them mercifully from sight they who went
upright like men and were not men-they
whom he knew he had seen once with the
woman whose name and face he could not
remember-or forget

  the old sickness came over him when he
thought of them he turned swiftly and
stumbled down three steps and fell against
the door the brown girl held for him he was
shaking hard he felt the cold burning down
the street as the door shut behind him heard
the first thin tinkling of the bells and the
high shrilling from overhead was like a ring-
ing in the ears maddening impossible to
shake away

  the door shut out most of the noise it was
dark now but a firm hand took his elbow and
he hurried down an unseen hall beside the
pattering steps of his guide

  what kind of a woman is it im hunting
he wondered when all i know about her is
that she once went familiarly with them

the king summoned them again the
girl in the dark beside him volunteered

speaking in her strangely accented patois
there must be strange things happening
among the tents tonight a rumor is that
the lords have attacked that castle in the
mountains you can sometimes see from our
walls

  so there was some connection then boyce
thought perhaps at last the pattern was
beginning to click into place and his own
part in it might come clear

  a door opened before him upon light and
smoke and voices the brown girl pushed
him through

  he saw first a lamp hanging from the
center of the ceiling over a broad table the
table was tiled into intricate patterns and
some sort of game seemed to be in process
upon it a circle of men bent above the
counters their faces in shadow because of
the hanging lamp

  one of them was laughing and sweeping
counters in they were carved and jeweled
pieces a little like chessmen and each one
rang with a different note when the players
touched it

  when the door opened there was a little
hush and the men looked up

  the man from nains temple the brown
girl said

  youre late one of the players declared
have you brought what you promised

  waste no time on him someone else
urged in a belligerent voice hes made us
wait too long already his stories are
probably lies from the beginning i say-
waste no time

  boyce looked at them blankly guillaume
had not told him about this the crusader
had been lying on the last brink of ex-
haustion and there were obviously things he

was unable to recall this must be one of
them

  obviously guillaume had been pretending
to offer secrets for sale on the castle defense
or tancreds strength or something else that
the lords of the city would buy boyce felt
a surge of anger and dismay the risks were
great enough certainly in his coming here
at all without walking into a trap unarmed
and unwarned

 there was only one course to take he
strode forward with guillaumes arrogant
rolling step and struck the table a blow that
made all the counters jump on their squares
and ring faintly together

  by all the gods he roared with guill-
aumes great bellow youll take what i
give and wait my pleasure on it

 there was an angry murmur around the
table chairs scraped back across the tiled
floor and one man rose and threw down the
counter he had been holding it rolled across
the board jingling as it went

  you speak with a big voice for a traitor
the man said he was young by his tone and
slender in an ankle-length robe of chain
steel slit on both sides above the knee to
show red leather boots and red breeches
he carried two long daggers in his belt and
his plumed hats brim dipped broadly down
in front to shade his eyes

  later well brawl if you still want it
now youll give us your news if we have to
tear it out of you he glanced around the
table many of us would rather take it that
way i would myself he laughed and laid
both hands on his dagger-hilts

  one of the others a short broad man with
flaming red hair jumped to his feet and
tossed back the purple cloak he wore to show
the long barbed whip coiled like a belt about
his thick waist

 why shbuld we pay the dog anything
for his secrets he demanded in an un-
expectedly high voice i know a way to
make him howl well-

  a white-haired man in a white fur cloak
lifted his hand placatingly

  friends friends be silent let the man
speak

  let him lie you mean the red-head said
sullenly the last time we met him and his
friend they promised us kerak on a silver
tray and that was the last we saw of them
theyve had payment already for secrets they
never told us it was wonderful how fast they
vanished once they got their hands on our

silver

  now this one comes back alone and talk-
ing as lordly as jamai himself how do we
know where the other one is offering the
same secrets to someone else wholl get to
jamai before us-thats my word on it im
finished deal with him as you will i say
-let him die

oyce laughed contemptuously

  the least talk the loudest he said
im back among you-isnt that proof
enough of good faith

  he wondered if it was evidently guill-
aume and godfrey had dealt with these
men just before their capture by jamai
and the story of that capture must be secret
or he would not now be in danger for hav-
ing disappeared without reason desperately
he wondered what secrets guillaume had
meant to invent for them if he could only
have found godfrey first

  enough babble enough the red-haired
man broke in i want my own answer
will you lead us by that secret way you
spoke of dog that ive paid for and i de-
mand your word on it are you ready to take
us secretly to kerak when our master gives
the signal

  recklessly boyce said yes

  there was a drawn breath all around the
table then the white-haired man straight-
ened in his chair and smiled his face was in
shadow like all the rest but boyce could see
the triumph on it

  very well said the man that is good
we are ready-now

 the red-haired man laughed seeing
boyces face

 we tricked you there you were not
expecting that but we must go quickly as
soon as the streets have cleared he
glanced involuntarily toward the door and
a shadow of pure revulsion touched his
ruddy face

  the white-robed man stood up

  no delay he said or jamais spies
may warn him what we plan now as for the
course we take-

  boyce was not listening he knew he could
not go through with it even if he were will-
ing to play the traitor be could not for he
knew no secret ways into kerak if any such
existed also it was no part of his vague
plan to leave the city now just as he had
entered it there was godfrey to be rescued
for one thing and for another-he had not
lands of the earthquake	

yet come any nearer to the girl in the iron
crown

  wait he said harshly the men around
the table were all on their feet now tighten-
ing their belts talking eagerly among them-
selves

  they turned to him expectantly suspicious
eyes gleaming in the shadow

  this is beyond my bargain boyce said
i was not paid for such a risk as this ill
need more money

  you were paid beyond your desserts the
first time the red man began angrily
you-

  ill be a masterless man when kerak
falls boyce told them brazenly i must
look out for myself then ill need more silver
for that

  someone who had not yet spoken laughed
in the shadows

  he betrays his lord for money and
demands more because hes masterless the
new voice said i like this man friends
boyce thought there had been something
familiar in the voice and in the strange tone
of the laughter later-if there was to be
any such time as later for him-he would
try to remember just now he had no time
to spare

  more money or i go nowhere he said
stubbornly

  the red-haired man growled a curse in
some odd language that sounded as if it had
been made for curses he took a purse from
his belt reluctantly and threw it jingling on
the table

  there dog buy yourself a new master
with that then

  not enough boyce sneered beneath his
new moustache for alms like that id get
no better man than you

  the red man laid a freckled paw upon his
whip-belt he snarled in his blasphemous
language and boyce thought for an instant
the battle would begin there and then but
the snarl died the man set his teeth grimly
took out another purse and flung it beside the
first

  dogs come high in this place he
growled and now-

  it was no use they needed him too badly
boyce would have to provoke them still
farther before he could escape

  money or no money he roared suddenly
ill not lead you to kerak red-head you
stay behind or the bargains ended ive
taken a dislike to the color of your hair

          chapter ix
          escape by water

in the amazed silence the young man in
the chain mail laughed softly

  dont you see he said the fellow is
trying to force a quarrel he doesnt mean
to go at all

  for a moment no one moved then the
white-haired man with the gentle face tossed
his cloak back over one shoulder

  i think- he said quietly i think he had
better die

  there was a quick concerted motion in the
room and boyce heard a sound he had never
heard before-a curious metallic minor note
all through the crowd it was the whine of
swords drawn simultaneously from their
sheaths

  the shadows were suddenly alive with the
flash of bare blades boyces hand flew to
his own belt and the light sword the cru-
saders had given him leaped into his fist
but this was no magical blade it was good
sharp beautifully balanced but he must fight
this battle alone without tancreds magic
gripping the hilt of the sword he wielded

  the red man bellowed once a deep sound
of pure fury and his hand flashed toward his
belt there was a ripping sound as the
barbed whip uncoiled and arched through the
air like a serpent with fangs along its sides

  now dog-howl for your master his
voice was choked with rage the whip sang
through the air and boyce had an instants
vision of his own face laid open to the bone
as the lash fell

  he leaped back groping behind him for
the door his hand found it just as the whip
fell it fell so little short of his cheek that the
wind of it fanned his mustache and he could
hear the vicious whine of the barbs along
the edges of the lash singing in his ear

  the door was locked

  he heard the whip strike the floor at his
feet with a metallic crash of jangled barbs
he heard the redheads sobbing breath of
fury saw him step back and brace his thick
legs wide for a second try he saw beyond
the red man the flicker of nervous blades as
the others crowded tensely forward poised to
close in if the whip should fail again

  he saw the young man in chain mail a
dagger in each hand as long ss a short sword
	startling stories

come lightly around the table toward him
walking as if on air his whole body poised as
jithely as the whip itself

  then again the lash sang with the motion
of a snake it arched backward and seemed to
hang in midair for a tense and singing
moment the red mans wrist curved for-
ward and so did the hanging whip

  this time he could not avoid it boyces
back was against the door and the youngster
in chain-mail barred the only other exit
he could feel his flesh crawl already in
anticipation of that terrible clawed lash and
he knew there was no hope for him now
the adventure that had begun with the first
of that lost year would end in this room with
the ripping of his flesh from his bones and
he would never know the answers he had
sought

  in this last moment before the lash fell he
had one vivid glimpse of a scene he had
remembered only dimly before he saw a
crowned girl standing before a window as
delicately crystalline as a snowflakes pat-
tern he saw her very clearly in memory
as she turned and glanced at him once across
her shoulder he saw her eyes bright with
violet fire and the whiteness of her smile and
the deep crimson of her lips he saw all the
brilliance and the danger of that nearly for-
gotten face

  and this time in the stress of his danger
a name rose in his mind he did not know if
he whispered it aloud or not it couldnt mat-
ter nothing mattered now-not even the
fact that he could speak her name-at last

  irathe he said it to himself in a passion
of fury and despair irathe

  and then the whip came down

  laughter-familiar laughter-sounded
again from the far side of the room and
beside him just as he saw the lashs tip leap-
ing straight for his eyes feet suddenly made
a soft quick thudding on the floor

  something dazzling shot past his face
boyce braced himself for the impact of the
whip it took him a perceptible moment to
realize that the barbed blow had not fallen
dizzy with bewilderment and surprise he fell
back a pace to the right and stared hearing
a clang from the opposite wall

  before him on the floor lay the severed
whip a long dagger bright in the lamplight
clattered across the floor and lay still a
thrown dagger that had flashed past his eyes
to cut the whip in two

  he turned his head and saw the young man

in mail poised beside him the second dagger
lifted in his hand

  get me that knife the youngster said
peremptorily to boyce quick ill put this
one through the first man that moves

  automatically boyce stooped and took up
the blade that had saved him eyes still on
the crowd the youth reached out blindly for
the hilt the dagger seemed to jump into
his hand so expertly did he take it now
he jerked his plumed head toward the door
beyond him

  you first he said quick outside

  still too amazed to question anything
boyce slid past him against the wall and
reached the other door the youth backed
after him both throwing blades poised
menacingly his lithe body was poised as
menacingly as the knives boyce thought he
was laughing though he could not see his
face

  he stood in the doorway a moment his
quick glance searching the room bare
swords quivered in the light as the furious
crowd about the table leaned toward him
none quite daring to be first to move eyes
glared redly under the swinging lamp

the youngster laughed aloud then with
a quick motion he raised one booted leg
and kicked the table over at the angry faces
before him boyce catching excitement from
the sound of that exultant laughter came
suddenly to life and leaned out beside his
mailed rescucr long arm and long sword
reached over the armored shoulder and boyce
slashed the chain that held the lamp

  it crashed down over the falling table
there was a wild jingling of musical counters
spilled from the game-board the light
flared sharply and went out darkness
swallowed up the room and with it the angry
faces of the men inside

  good work the young man laughed
across his shoulder there was the sound of
a slamming door close beside them then
run this way and a hand that still held
a dagger nudged hiarm

  through pitch blackness along an echoing
passage the two fled behind them through
the closed door a confused uproar sounded
then boyce saw light ahead and realized
that they were coming out upon a broad
underground pier with black water on both
sides of it at the same moment be heard the
door behind them burst open and the shouts
of the pursuers gain suddenly in volume
lands of the

echoing hollowly along the corridor they had
just cleared

 boat here boyces companion gasped
breathlessly end of the pier-hurry

  the sound of their racing feet was like
thunder on the hollow boards as they ran
for the end of the dock someone yelled
behind them and a vicious whine sounded
past boyces ear ahead of them an arrow
struck the pier and vibrated singing

  the feet of the pursuers struck the dock
now and the dark underground place echoed
and re-echoed to the noise of heavy boots on
boards and the shouts of the angry men a
bowstring sang again and another arrow
whined past boyce glanced back

  the redhead was foremost among the pur-
suers purple cloak streaming from his
shoulders he brandished the stub of his
mutilated whip a formidable weapon still
with its length of barbed lash the rest made
a jostling mob behind him among which
swords flickered in the light of the lamps
strung along the edges of the pier

  boyce heard again that annoying familiar
laugh among the shouts he would place it
when he had a moment to spare-he would
think once more of the crowned girl whose
name he knew again after such a long long
interval of forgetfulness but later later-
not now

  his companion was kneeling at the end of
the pier leaning over to untie a boat he
glanced up as boyce came panting to the
water-edge hurry he said well make
it yet i- and then his gaze went beyond
boyce and he said more sharply look out
behind you and leaped to his feet

 boyce spun the redhead had paused a
little distance away and was swinging his
whip again shortened though it was his
range was too close to miss boyce dropped
almost to one knee ducking under the
vicious inward curl of the lash heard it
whistle overhead and launched himself hard
for the redheads thick body

  his shoulder struck the man in the chest
and he heard the gasping grunt the man gave
and felt the toppling body give way beneath
his driving blow it had all happened quick-
ly boyce scrambled to his feet as the red-
head rolled across the dock

  he snatched up the sword he had dropped
in the moment of impact seeing the red-
booted feet of his companion flash by him
as he rose he looked up in time to see his
rescuer make a joyous sort of leap toward

earthquake	

the fallen man kick him twice in the face
and give the squirming body a last thrust of
the boot-toe that sent him splashing off into
the black water

  then boyce was clambering down the short
ladder toward the boat with the first of the
others almost upon him over his shoulder
there was a flash of red boots and silver mail
and the armored youngster hit the boat
before him boyce slashed the rope that held
it to the pier with one stroke of his sword

  beneath him as the rope parted he felt an
instant forward surge and the pier seemed to
drop away as if by magic in their wake the
boat was very low and not much larger than
a rowboat it was dead black in color so
nearly the shade of the black water that to
the observers it must seem they moved un-
supported over the surface of the waves

  whatever power moved it was invisible
it might have had a motor but if it did
there was no sound or vibration to prove it
boyce thought it must be propelled by some
force of this unknown world harnessed to a
science such as tancred had described a
science so wholly aben that magic was as
good a word for it as any

 several more arrows sang past as the
boat shot smoothly away but the shafts
dropped into the water behind them in a
few moments even the shouts from the pier
had died as the lights died and the boat
moved through darkness and silence

  limp with relief and more than a little
confused by the sudden change of attitude
which his companion had shown during the
fight boyce sat back in the boat and sighed
heavily

  all right he said what now

  against the dim luminance of the water he
could see in vague outline the younger mans
hat and head and bent shoulders he seemed
to be guiding the boat he laughed softly in
the dark it was not a reassuring sound

  wait and see he said

          chapter x
          the wrong she

daylight glimmered ahead the grey
balf-daylight which was all these
drifting lands ever knew the boat glided
under an archway and boyce caught his
breath at sight of what rose before them it
	startling stories

was a great round tower that seemed to be
all of filigree story upon story of it the
interstices glazed with sparkling crystal its
wall rose straight from the center of a moat-
like lake

  within boyce could see dimly the shadows
of moving figures here and there no more
than animate blurs upon the filigree walls
a tower of glass he thought and guillaume
had worn a collar of glass was there a con-
nection there or did all the city use glass-
work in its building and its magic he re-
membered now that he had broken through
glass to enter this curious world

  the boat moved swiftly and smoothly over
the grey water amid clouds of mist and a low
door opened in the base of the tower as they
neared it

  now we are home again the armored
youngster said and bent his head beneath
the arch as the boat glided in boyce stooped
too they came into a water room walled
with translucent glass and a man in a brown
tunic a collar locked about his neck came
down broad steps to take the boat from its
master

  come the young man said scrambling
out of the boat and hurrying up the stairs
his red boots flashing beneath the heavy
mail

  boyce followed him only as far as the
platform around the pool then he took a
firmer grip on his sword glanced around the
room for the nearest exit

  not yet he said grimly i dont know
enough about you lets get all this a little
clearer before i-

  i think the young man interrupted
pausing in the doorway i heard you call
upon irathe

  boyce gave him a long steady look under
the hat-brim the mans eyes were watchful
after a moment boyce put the sword back
into its sheath at his side

  go ahead he said ill follow

  he heard the other laugh to himself then
the man turned and led the way up a ramp
of translucent crystal that wound around the
tower just inside the filigree walls they
were transparent from within and boyce
could look out over the whole city as they
climbed seeing the narrow streets open out
beneath him again filled with their colorful
crowds

  toward the center of the city a building of
black stone rose square and sheer above the
rooftops above boyce on the stairs the

younger man waved a pointing arm

  the king he said

  boyces brows lifted the brown girl who
had guided him here said it was the king
who summoned them they had wound in
their dark procession through these very
streets then toward that high black build-
ing where someone awaited them who was
not afraid-or was even the king afraid-
to look upon their faces and it was city
gossip that the summoning had something to
do with the conquest of kerak

  there was a painted room at the head of
the ramp three walls of it were covered
with patterns of birds and flowers seen
against a bright sky boyce glanced care-
lessly at the colorful scenes looked away-
glanced back with amazement

  blue sky he demanded scarcely know-
ing he spoke birds flowers blue skies
here in the city

  his host had crossed to a far comer and
was unbuckling his sword-belt boyces eyes
swept the room the fourth wall was of
glass and framed a vast panorama of city
streets and mist and mountains beyond them
and a distant glimpse of kerak with a tiny
flash of crimson above the towers which was
keraks enchanted flag heavy golden cur-
tains covered the walls here and there and
there were broad divans and deep chairs
cushioned with velvet it was a luxurious
place

  but he scarcely saw it he was still en-
thralled by the presence of blue pictured
skies when so far as he knew the city had
drifted forever on the sluggish land-tide of a
world that knew no real day

 what do you know about the sky he
demanded turning to the silent figure of his
host

  he saw the figure stoop to lay down the
broad plumed hat his back was still to
boyce

  as much as you know william boyce
the other said amazingly

 boyces breath stopped for a stunned
moment

 who-who are you how do you know
my name

  the young man did not yet turn he lifted
both arms to the latches on the shoulders of
his mail robe clicked them deliberately and
let the linked steel drop away beneath it
he wore breeches and a close-fitted tunic of
scarlet above the scarlet boots he put his
hands to his head and shook out a sudden
lands of the earthquake	

wreath of dark curls that fell upon the crim-
son shoulders as he turned

  he laughed

 do you remember now

  the room spun around boyce it was dark
a roaring darkness that was only the blood
in his ears he opened his mouth but no
words came he stared and stared and could
not move or speak

  she was not wearing the long robe he
remembered nor the iron crown but the
violent eyes were there the color of hot
small flames and the same smile he re-
membered white and scarlet and dazzling
and the same look of brilliance and danger
and malice

  he said in a whisper l-rathe

  there she said sohly i knew youd
remember in the end

  she came toward him slowly walking with
a lovely swaying gait he surely could not
have forgotten until now when she was
very near him she lifted her arms and her
head fell back until the dark curls lay in
wreaths upon her shoulders

he knew before he touched her how
the strong soft body would feel in
his arms in the instant before they kissed
he knew what the kiss would be like the
shape and the feel of her mouth beneath his
even the spicy fragrance she wore was
familiar he did not yet remember fully but
he knew he had held her thus many many
times in the past in his lost year

  and so you remember now

  boyce shifted his arm about her the dark
curls fanning on his shoulder in a fragrant
mass they sat together on a divan before
the window looking out over the tremen-
dous panorama of the city and the hills
beyond

  he paused a moment
no a little-not much ill have to know
irathe he hesitated over the name he was
not sure yet not sure at all how much had
been solved by this meeting he was still
uncertain about her he knew too little

  he was thinking of the way she had used
her throwing-knives in the gaming-room
brawl of how her scarlet boots had kicked
an enemy twice in the face before rolling
him into the water to drown now she was
all softness and fragrance in his arms but
it was not quite like this that he remembered
her he was not sure yet what it was he did
remember-but he thought he knew what

he did not remember it was not like that

 you loved me in your own world my
darling she murmured against his cheek
you loved me enough to-to follow me here
i think can you say youve forgotten our
year together on earth

  she was mocking him she knew he had
forgotten she knew because it had been
her doing that he had he closed his eyes
and struggled with his own mind determined
to prove her wrong this time

  slowly painfully in snatches and blanks
and brief vivid pictures a piecemeal sort of
memory began to return

  there was a house he said carefully
on the river you-it was your house
big quiet no one around and a-servant
one two people- he recalled suddenly
the swarthy man who had come to take the
boat in the pool-chamber below people
from here he finished in surprise

 of course why not from my native
city she smiled at him derisively go on
your memorys better than i thought go on
-if you dare

  he paused at that yes somewhere at the
other end of this memory was something
frightening-something she knew of and
dared him to recall he would not but he
would go on a little more not too far   

  i met you-somewhere he said groping
for a dim picture of the two of them together
in some forgotten public place it was-i
dont know somewhere by accident-

  her laughter stopped him malice and
derision sounded together in it

  accident you think oh no that was not
accident my darling i searched for you a
long time-or for one like you one of the
blood of the crusaders

  he turned to stare into her violent eyes
they mocked him

  but that cant be true im not he
hesitated guillaume du bois-william
boyce face and name the same

 why he demanded she moved her
cheek catlike against his shoulder

  i had a task to do i still have a task
for a moment he thought he heard weari-
ness and genuine feeling in her sigh i have
gone many times into many worlds seeking
many men and women trying to finish that
task perhaps youll finish it for me my
darling perhaps ive found the right man at
last

  he did not answer he was thinking clear-
ly and rapidly watching memories tumble
	startling stories

through his mind like a kaleidoscope pic-
tures that shifted as he watched into new
patterns some of them significant some sheer
nonsense as he recalled them

  he had met the girl-somewhere he knew
that now and he must have fallen instantly
irrationally in love he could remember a
part of that delirium now he could feel a
part of it still at this moment with this
warm sweet-smelling girl in his arms but
there was something wrong it was not
quite the same girl

  in that year there had been no question
he had followed her because he could not
help himself it was sheer infatuation obses-
sion-as if a spell had been laid on him to
follow wherever she went and she went to
her big quiet secret house on the river in
new york and there with him and with her
servants for a long long while she had
worked at-something

  what he had not known even then
there were wide gaps in his memory there
were blanks induced deliberately he thought
to keep her purpose secret but if she had
chosen him because of his likeness to guill-
aume his remote kinship with guillaume-
then her purpose must have been connected
with kerak and the destruction of the cru-
saders why it seemed a trivial thing to
stretch over so wide a range of time and
space to involve such infinite effort

  in the end-careful careful he reminded
himself-in the end had come that thing
which was too terrible to recall-the thing
that had sealed off his memory of the whole
year like scar-tissue to protect a wound too
deep to heal without it

  something about them   

a dark procession coming up from the
river with tiny lights twinkling and
tiny bells ringing and a breath of cold as
searing as heat blowing before them to warn
all beholders away

  watching them from an upper window-
congealed with an incredulity and a revulsion
that would not accept what he saw-some-
thing about a doorway he watched and
they parading through it toward him walk-
ing like men though they were not and
never could be men themselves

  her head had turned upon his shoulder
she was looking up at him and smiling a
wise malicious smile

  i warned you she said even then i
warned you you shouldnt have stayed that

long so i had to do whatever i could to
make sure youd forget she laughed as
lightly as she had laughed when she kicked
the fallen red man on the pier you for-
got she said gaily

  suddenly boyce knew there was some-
thing wrong here he realized the wrong-
ness so quickly that his body moved before
he was aware that he had stirred he found
himself on his feet facing the divan and he
knew he had flung irathe from his shoulder
and sprang away as if the touch of her were
loathsome

  it wasnt you he said his voice sound-
ing thick and strange i know now-it was
someone else not you

  he saw her lovely brightly tinted face
convulse as if a flame had shot up behind it
lighting a violet glare in her eyes and draw-
ing her beautiful bright features into a
grotesque shape of evil

  it was it was she screamed there
were fury and passion in her voice and a
strange wild grief he could not understand
but above all there was evil sheer pure
evil such as he had never dreamed to see so
nakedly in a human face no face could be
wholly human and hold so much of it

  no he shouted and saw her double sud-
denly with a motion like a striking snake
and snatch at something hidden inside the
loose top of her high scarlet boots

  he should have taken warning he should
have dodged but she moved too fast for
him she straightened and her red arm flew
back and he saw something black and
blurred flying straight at his face he saw it
come and grow enormously and spread to
shut out all the room behind it but he did
not see it strike for he was no longer there
to see or feel

  he floated in oblivion rocking on mists
like the clouds that move over the face of
the drifting lands   

  pain in bright regular flashes roused him
slowly he groaned and stirred not knowing
it was himself who moved it hurt to breathe
he opened his eyes and looked up blankly at
a high window framing a fantastic panorama
twilight and a city lighted as always with
colored lanterns swinging in the breeze above
wet narrow streets

  he tried to get up and could not little
by little awareness came back he was
lying on the floor by the divan his wrists
and ankles were tied tightly-with vicious
tightness-as if irathe had drawn the bonds
lands of the earthquake	

with all her strength his head ached and
he had been struck a number of times across
the face by the stiff stinging feel of it also
he thought she must have driven her booted
toes into his ribs to judge by the pain that
accompanied each breath

  he wondered how long he had lain here
there was no way of telling time-if time
existed at all inside the city there were
things he had to do godfrey still lay im-
prisoned hoping for rescue from kerak and
he knew there were other duties he might
remember later when his head stopped
spinning

  what had happened he had angered
irathe of course-he was not quite sure how
but he had touched her in a very sore spot
if the fury in her voice and her actions had
been any criterion

  and yet-it had not been she lying there
on the floor he forgot for a moment his more
urgent problems in the all-encompassing
mystery of just who that crowned girl was
whom he remembered so vividly the name
the face-yes but this fiery-eyed girl with
evil like a lantern burning in her-no it
had not been she   

  he stirred again and said softly to him-
self irathe

  instantly there was a sound in the room
bare feet came across the floor almost in
silence cautiously and a brown face bent
above his unfamiliar from this awkward
angle on the rug

  master said a gentle voice with fear in
it master-do you know me

she was brown and bare-limbed and she
wore heavy golden bands on wrists and
ankles and a golden collar about her throat
she was the little guide who had taken him
from nains temple to meet irathe and her
quarrelsome fellow-conspirators he had not
yet had time to wonder about that strange
combination or what irathe had been doing
there among them in disguise

  master the girl whispered again her
eyes rolling above him so that the whites
showed as she watched the corners of the
room for-irathe was she a servant of
irathe herself or was this show of terror
genuine he could not trust anyone at all
in the city now

  master i followed all the way the brown
girl whispered i must ask a question
master are you jamais man

  boyces head ached he did not know

jamai except as a name and a menace he
was tired of all this intrigue of which he
knew so little and he had no strong feeling
just now for any in the city but one

  im no ones man but my own he said
angrily but if jamai is against irathe id
like to know him is that what you want

  she smiled a white smile above him

  thank you master the brown face dis-
appeared briefly then he felt hands turning
him gently felt the coldness of a blade
against his wrists felt the intolerable tight-
ness of his bonds fall away

  that will be painful master in a mo-
ment she warned working on his ankles
when the pain passes we will go

  he rubbed his wrists

  where

  if the gods are with us and we leave this
tower alive-her eyes rolled again fear-
fully-we go to one who is jamais deadliest
foe

  and irathes

  she looked down evasively

  we must go quickly she said it is
better not to talk until were free of this
house

  boyce shrugged his limbs were begin-
ning to prickle with returning circulation
but the pain in his side lessened as he waited
and he was eager to go he could deal with
irathe later and he would that was a
promise to himself

  the brown girl was holding one of the
draperies aside and beckoning to him there
was a grille in the wall and a steep stair-
way winding down into blackness limping
boyce followed her into the dark

chapter xi
again the huntsman

before a high oval door that glowed
silver in the light of her tiny lantern
boyces guide paused at last holding up her
light to show him the latch

  beyond this door i dare not go she said
frankly you must if you seek jamais
downfall

  who sent you boyce demanded keep-
ing his voice as low as hers

  they had come a long way through wind-
ing underground corridors surfacing only
twice to walk a short distance along alleys
	startling stories

or across lighted streets the motley city life
went on unheeding around them if irathe
had missed him yet her searchers were
subtle and the conspirators she had helped
him evade might be looking for him too

  he could not guess about that he followed
the brown girl through devious paths be-
cause she at least promised him a chance of
action alone he knew he could not accom-
plish anything in this inscrutable city
allied with jamais enemy-whoever that
might be he could at least gamble on success

  who sent me the girl echoed now hold-
ing up her lantern to look at him in the
dark passage my master will answer that
lord you go to him now but he is-capri-
cious lord you must go the rest of the way
alone and i dare not pass this door

  she swung it open and stood back

  my master awaits you at the end of the
corridor lord

  boyce went in cautiously the corridor
like the door was silver walls floor and
ceiling polished to mirror-brightness from
overhead small lamps hung swinging a little
in the breeze from the opened door it was
a city of lamps boyce thought-little lan-
terns and glass and wet streets with mist
blowing through them in a changeless twi-
light

  the door closed he went boldly down the
hall toward the curtains at its far end his
own reflections went with him distorted in
perspective above and below looking up
he saw himself grotesquely foreshortened
and floating upside down in space looking
down he was a fantastic dwarf in un-
familiar garments cross-blazoned mus-
tached his image repeated infinitely every-
where he glanced he felt dizzy in his own
distorted company

  he was not alone

  someone walked behind him at his very
heels someones breath fanned his cheek
when he turned but the someone was trans-
parent as the air he saw in the mirrors only
himself in those dizzy myriads he went on

  something padded before him on soft feet
there was a clink of metal like a blade in
a scabbard and a muffled laugh and some-
thing rushed by him down the hall with a
thumping of feet and a gust of displaced air
when it passed him

  something whistled by his face the wind
of it cold upon his skin it sounded like a
sword

  he met his own startled glance infinitely
multiplied in the mirrors when he looked

around in alarm nothing more but what-
ever the thing was it had not touched him
he remembered what his guide had said-
my master is-capricious-and smiled
grimly to himself

  he wanted me or he wouldnt have gone
to such trouble to get me here he reasoned
if this is a test of nerve-well let him play
his games whoever he is

  and he walked on as calmly as he could
ignoring the footsteps around him the sound
of breathing the padding of soft feet like the
feet of beasts the curtains looked very far-
away at the end of the corridor but he would
not let himself hurry to reach them confi-
dence was growing in him he thought he
had at last begun to understand a little of
what lay behind his coming

  the curtains parted before his touch he
passed into a low-ceiled room whose dark
walls were hung with embroidered draperies
beneath ceiling tented with a striped canopy
that billowed now and then as if from passing
breezes here as everywhere lamps hung
from above there was a dais across the other
end of the room and a low couch on it but
the dais was empty the room was empty

  boyce looked around him half in anger
before he could move laughter sounded from
behind him along the way he had come he
turned knowing the laughter at last low
and with a snarl in it he had heard it often
before most lately in that quarrelsome com-
pany of conspirators where irathe took his
part

  the curtains through which he had just
come opened again for a moment no one
was there-the curtains framed an empty
hall mirroring only its own length in geo-
metric confusion of walls and floor

  then the curtains fell and a man in tiger-
striped garments came into the room laugh-
ing to himself leaning back on the leash from
which two snarling cat-creatures led him
across the floor

  william du boyce the huntsman said
welcome to my palace we have postponed
our meeting too long already you and i

  boyce scowled at him saying nothing the
huntsman wrestled his sleek restless beasts
past him and went leisurely toward the dais
dropped to the divan there and smiled at
his guest

  youll forgive my little trick in the hall
he said you were in no danger of course

  boyce felt a touch of guillaumes arro-
gance creep into his own attitude as he faced
the huntsman
lands of the earthquake	

   knew that ive begun to think i was in
no real danger since i left kerak nor will be
until you get whatever it is you want of me
ive walked through too many dangers al-
ready it cant all have been accident

he huntsman smiled

  sound reasoning do you know
why

  why ive been safe you mean why
everything has worked out as you meant it
to i think i do know it must be that you
have bad a hand in it

  under his tiger-striped hood the hunts-
mans pale face lost its smile for a moment
a haunted look came into it boyce thought
he caught just a glimpse there of the same
desperation he had seen upon irathes face
when she screamed her denial to him in the
tower-room

next issue the kingdom of

  what do they say of me in kerak the
huntsman asked unexpectedly

  they say youre like the mist on the
plains-blowing wherever the wind blows
but- boyce gave him a quick glance i
think you know what they say in kerak
huntsman

  the face beneath the tiger-hood grimaced
  you do know then

  i know i havent been-call it alone-
since i first saw you on the cliff when i
entered this world

  the huntsman flung back his head and
laughed suddenly his mercurial mood
changing without warning

  we wont quibble about it yes it was i
and i did protect you here in the city-
most of the time there is something i want
of you william boyce you can repay me
for my care by helping me- he paused
delicately-to destroy keraks oracle
boyce met the expectant eyes coldly

  i owe you nothing

  you owe me a great deal youll do my
bidding in this-or would you like to see the
punishment of godfrey morel my friend
the huntsmans voice went thin in the last
words and the snarl sounded just beneath
the surface

  i came for that

  you speak too coolly william boyce
you think because youve walked safely so
far through this city you can afford to defy

the huntsman remember it was my hand
that kept you safe you cant afford my
enmity i warn you godfrey morel you
shall see-and join if you choose he half-
rose and the leashed beasts surged forward
against their collars their beautiful mad
faces wrinkled up in snarls the huntsman
cuffed at them with his free hand and sank
back again

  no wait theres too much you do not
know if i show you the truth i think you
may decide to help youve been deceived
too often to take anyone on faith just now
irathe for instance-she told you a little i
think

  a little boyce was wary he saw a
flicker of emotion on the huntsmans face
when he spoke irathes name and he began
to think he had a clue to part of the hunts-
mans mystery if irathe brought that sick

the blind by george  smith

longing angry look to other faces than his
own then he and the huntsman had one
thing at least in common

  you knew her in your world the hunts-
man said you helped her in her work
which was-important she left with you a
certain talisman-a crystal cold to the touch
-that opens the gateway here you used it
half by accident i suspect and came through
the broken window on that cliff i saw the
flash the magic made from my tower here
and when i reached the cliff you were just
awakening he paused a curious look
flickering across his face

  i meant to kill you then he said and
boyce suddenly recognized his look jealousy
was in it yes the huntsman loved irathe
too and hated her and himself because of it
and boyce because of-because of boyces
year with her on earth

  i would have killed you on sight he
went cm gently his voice soft but i was
not sure irathe hadnt summoned you until
you did not return my signal i could not be
sure and by then-well my mind changes
easily william boyce i indulge my fancies

  i let you go because a better thought had
come to me so i drove you toward kerak
i knew an attack was starting on the castle
then-jamais efforts have redoubled of late
because he grows weary of the struggle and
longs to end it

  i thought to myself he will die in kerak
	startling stories

if the attack succeeds let him die but if it
fails let him live and be my eyes and brain
to spy out what i can of tancreds secrets
because you see you wore the talisman and
i have power over that crystal as well as
irathe i made it for her long ago when she
was-not as she is now

  this time a shadow crossed the huntsmans
face and boyce saw the pale strong features
draw up in a grimace almost of pain

  t think she left that amulet to summon
you by when she was ready and i think you
came too soon i saw you too soon when
she learned of your presence here it was too
late for i had entered your mind already
by power of the talisman and there was no
room for her

  he laughed

  she was wild when she learned that
she-but you do not know the secret of
irathe do you william boyce you do not
know why you remember her as all that was
lovely and delightful or why she is not now
-herself well you shall know better
still-you shall see

  he got up lazily reining in the frantic
beasts and strolled to the wall at the head
of the dais he pulled a cord hanging among
the dark draperies and curtains swept back
on both sides to uncover a wall of clear
mirror glass in which only blue-gray mists
swam as if it were a window upon the plains

  tancred has a mirror like this the
huntsman said casually but smaller now
watch

  the mists rolled back on both sides a
room took shape in the glass as vividly as
if the mirror were a wall of the room and
that wall u ansparent the room was gigantic
ringed with pillars that reflected themselves
in the shining black floor

  the pillars marched up in a double line
to a great throne at the far end black hung
with scarlet a man sat on the throne light
catching in the crown he wore he was not
young and he was bending forward eagerly
in his robe of yellow satin stroking a dark
beard and watching

  boyce closed his eyes suddenly and whirled
on his heel his back to the mirror he was
shaking and the sweat felt cold on his fore-
head

  the huntsman laughed softly

  yes i know they are not good to look at
but watch if you can my friend they wear
robes so you need not look them in the
face and this they do is important to my
story-and to you

chapter xii
a cure for sorcery

slowly his body rigid boyce turned
back to the mirror he could not look
directly at them but by watching the corners
of the picture and keeping his jaw set hard
and his fists clenched he managed to control
his shaking and to see what went on in the
mirrored room

  they were only two tall robed figures
hidden entirely from sight but moving with
an impossible litheness that somehow set the
teeth on edge they were walking-gliding-
about a circle of glittering stones laid upon
the black floor before the throne their
robed limbs moved now and then in gestures
of ritual

  the sorcerer king the huntsman said
is a man hungry for power he loves power
and knowledge for their own sakes he
guides this city along the drifting lands as
ships are guided in other worlds seeking
new people and new places and new sources
of power also he picks up other treasures

  when he was younger he found one
treasure he prized highly-a lovely fair-
haired woman in outlandish garments wear-
ing a cross emblazoned on her bosom she
came from a castle built high on the cliffs of
certain mountains the city was then drifting
near the king was pleased with her and
took her into his household

  you know that story she bore him a
daughter and then died he loved the daugh-
ter but he did her a terrible wrong he had
not guessed how what he did would affect
himself or her or many people he had not
then heard of the daughter was a lovely
creature also she was wise and skilled in
many arts when the king came across a
source of power and knowledge beside which
all he had discovered before seemed tame
he shared the discovery with his daughter

  there was one trouble only that source
-those who knew what he wished to share-
were so alien that eyes like ours can not bear
to look upon them they live in another city
traveling these drifting lands but very far
from here

  a few of their travelers chanced into our
city and the king was enthralled by them
but he had no way of communicating with
them for one thing not even he could bear
lands of the earthquake	

to look them in the face or listen to their
voices and yet he could not bear to give up
commerce with them altogether

  they told him of one way only by which
they might communicate a very old way
almost all peoples have it and all old
legends it means the sacrifice of a maiden

  she would have to submit herself to their
sore cry and thereafter would serve as
liaison between the two peoples the human
mind they said was too complex too hy-
brid to deal with minds like theirs their
sorcery would change the mind of their
instrument dividing it in a way to make com-
munication possible they did not tell us
then what else the sorcery might do

  the king chose his daughter for that
sacrifice this thing meant more to him even
than she and she was the one alone he
thought whom he could trust in a position
of such power too i think their kinship was
to help in the transmission of knowledge
from them to the king

  it happened without my knowledge i
joved the kings daughter very deeply i
should have interfered had i guessed but i
came just as the ceremony was beginning
and until it was too late i did not know-

  he turned his back to the mirror and
struggled with his beasts bending over
them as if he did not want to see that scene
again

  look he said

  they moved with intricate hideously lithe
steps about the circle of fiery stones there
was a veiled figure in the center of the circle
now and the king was leaning forward a
look of pain and eagerness on his face

  fire leaped from the shining circle on the
floor it blazed to a pyramid of white light
and when it sank again the veil had vanished
from the girl in its midst she looked out
with blank unseeing eyes violet under an
iron crown her dark hair jay in ringlets on
her shoulders

  she had a lovely soft mouth and even now
a look of vividness and a delicate familiar
beauty which made boyce lean forward sud-
denly and catch his breath forgetting even
the figures parading around the fire with
jnak e-like motions of their robed arms

  irathe- he heard himself whisper

  ttie fire leaped again through it the slim
crowned figure was faintly visible it shim-
mered before his eyes curiously unfocused
inside the screen of flame it divided drew
apart

  the fire sank there were two figures in-
side the burning ring but only for a moment
then irathe swept up her skirts in one
smooth motion and stepped over the low-
burning flames her eyes were violet-bright
the color of the fire her face was dazzling
with a beauty more burning than the old
irathe ever knew but danger was in the
face now danger and a fierce unstable joy

behind her a motionless girl stood in
the enchanted ring not a girl-a
marble figure pale as stone drained of all
life the marble hair lying upon the marble
shoulders the marble robes sweeping
straight to the floor hands clasped before
her eyes closed serene and empty the
figure of kerak s oracle had taken shape in
the ring and remained there while irathe
stepped lightly away from all that remained
of her old self

  it was the same face-if it could be when
all that meant life had been drained from it
boyce saw now that he might have known
those marble features in kerak-or could he
have known them in that inhuman repose
without the spark which meant irathe glow-
ing behind them his memory had been too
imperfect then he had not known her face
or her name and nothing about the lifeless
oracles features had reminded him of her
other self

  the huntsman still bending to stroke the
head of one snarling cat-creature spoke as
if to the beast his voice soft

  i had loved her before the-change how
could i stop loving her afterward and
there was nothing left alive in the good half
for a man to love so it had to be irathe as
she is now-evil terrible to the mind and
the eye and most so for a man like me who
can see beneath the surface but to my
heart she is still irathe and my love

  suddenly he slapped the snarling beast
across the face it twisted its head with cat-
like quickness and slashed at his wrist with
bared fangs the huntsman laughed and
cuffed it aside

  they could not destroy the marble image
which was all that remained when that half
of irathes mind which was good and sinless
split from the half which was evil knowing
too much of magical things irathe wanted
to destroy it the sight of it seemed to mad-
den her she was not irathe now and the
knowledge of her own incompleteness was
more than she could bear with that marble
	startling stories

thing as a reminder

  they were indifferent they had what
they wanted they would not help further
so irathe thinking to get the white marble
being out of her sight and memory drove it
into the drifting lands and hoped she might
forget it

  the gods alone know what thoughts
move in that still stone mind but some
memory of her mothers people led her to
kerak and they took her in then irathe
sent a cage of fire to keep her imprisoned
hoping the city would drift away and rid
her forever of that shape which had been
herself

  but it was not so easy the two halves
of her were not wholly parted a bond
between them remained a bond so strong
that while it stretches between kerak and
the city the two are anchored together and
cannot drift apart that means of course
that irathe must conquer keraks oracle
she does not know the way she has worked
a long long while on that secret

  by now she is very wise-far wiser than
i i think she knows the answer which will
mean the conquest of her other half but
the oracle too is wise and tancred
keraks magician is a rival in some ways
even for irathe so she could not gain
an entrance into kerak-until she found
you

  boyce broke in abruptly cutting off the
slow reminiscent voice that seemed to be
watching the past unfold as it spoke on

  youre lying he declared with all of
guillaumes arrogance i knew her too
he hesitated he would not say i loved
her too that was a matter between him
and the real complete irathe if ever they
met again but once they had met-he was
sure of that-and she had been whole

  i know you did the huntsman gave
him one glance under the tiger-striped hood
and hatred and envy was in the glance but
his voice was calm you knew her as i did
in one of her moments of completion you
see there are certain times when the cage
of flame does not prison keraks oracle
the time is naw boyce

  the dark eyes were sombre

  you have listened to me william boyce
because i had information you needed but
why do you suppose i troubled to make these
explanations

  boyce hesitated but before he could speak
he sensed a change in the huntsmans face

bright and triumphant as lightning flickering
across a leaden autumn sky

  and suddenly boyce knew his mistake
he had a flash of keen regret the knowledge
that he had somehow walked blindly into
a trap-and then for an intolerable instant
of spinning vertigo the walls before him
tilted and slipped sidewise and dissolved
into roaring chaos

  tumbling mists shrouded him another
mind another power was using him as a
mans hand wields a machine his body his
eyes his thoughts were not his own now
briefly he crouched in a timeless lightless
place the deepest citadel of his self where
no intruder could reach

  the monstrous claustrophobia slackened-
was gone

	be stood again before the laughing
mm huntsman

  thick wordless sounds spewed from his
lips as he tried to speak the huntsmans
eyes were ablaze with triumph

  is it hard to use your tongue boyce
he mocked that will not last long in a
moment the feeling will pass when a man
has been out of his body it is not always
easy to return

  boyce hunched his shoulders feeling such
anger as he had never known before against
this sorcerer who could use him at will as a
man dons a glove and doffs it

  he felt warmth beginning to return to his
limbs though he had not felt their coldness
till now

 you-

  speak you have done me a great service
boyce i owe you an honest answer at
least

  what have you made me do

  the huntsman sobered and now his eyes
glittered with something very much like
madness

  you have done an errand for me not
your body-but another part of you your
mind your soul perhaps i sent that to
kerak a moment ago have you forgotten
my words this is one of the brief cyles
during which the oracle is free of her cage
of flame

  what did you do

  i used you to summon the oracle here
free from her cage she can go where she
wills-but the spell of emptiness holds her
even now she comes to the city now be-
cause you called her boyce
lands of the earthquake	

oyce spoke hoarsely

  why should she come to my call
should a woman not come when her
lover calls when her husband summons
the huntsman dwelt on the words as he
would have gripped the sharp blade of a
dagger what showed on his face was pure
jealousy

  lover husband but it was irathe who
had come to earth-

  i will give you death if you like the
huntsman said quietly it is best of all
better than life perhaps in death you may
join keraks oracle

  that passion-drained calm more than the
huntsmans previous mockery roused boyce
he thought-with a breath this sorcerer can
drive me as a wind drives a leaf but-
curse your magic boyce roared the
ice had gone from his limbs the fire of rage
melted the paralyzing chill

  for so long had the huntsman dueled with
the rapiers of magic that he had apparently
forgotten more primitive methods of battle
boyces fist smashed home on the mans jaw
a solid vicious blow that jolted his arm
dear back to the shoulder

  he did it almost without reason driven
only by a sudden instinctive revolt against
the cobweb-soft clinging bonds of enchant-
ment that had wound about him since he had
entered this alien world-nd even before
that

  to have the huntsman use him mind and
body with that contemptuous disregard for
his own demands was suddenly unendur-
able and that molten rising rage culmin-
ated in the blow that caught the huntsman
by surprise and sent him crashing back
stunned against the wall

  magic boyce said his voice a snarl of
hatred theres the cure for that

  but the huntsman could not answer he
was a crumpled silent figure red blood
trickling down his jaw

  a wordless eerie cry made boyce turn
he had forgotten the pack the tiger-cats
were shifting uneasily their bright dappled
bodies sliding soundlessly in an intricate
pattern backward and forward the beauti-
ful mad faces watched him

  he glanced quickly around the room a
breath of wind rippled down a tapestried
hanging bright with black and gold boyce
took a cautious step in that direction

  and another still the pack hesitated
  boyce reached the tapestry and slipped

beneath it as he had guessed there was an
opening in the wall a metal door was ajar
and a soft wind blew on his sweating face

  mournfully with inhuman sweetness from
the room he had left rose a wailing scream
from a beasts throat it was echoed and
reechoed

  boyce put his shoulder to the door and
slammed it shut there was no bolt only
a latch that could be lifted from either side
if the huntsman recovered-

  boyces teeth showed in an unpleasant
grin his heavy shoulders squared
he turned to stare down the dim blue
twilight of the tunnel

           chapter xiii
           the king is dead

briefly he thought that the walls were
hung with arabesque curtains then
he saw them more clearly bas-relief carv-
ings had been laid with a lavish hand on
these walls it was a design of roots or
branches-or perhaps serpents-intertwined
in a jungle tangle that the eyes could not
follow the stone was varicolored marked
with brighter striations glittering with mica
and gem-chips the passage seemed to be
walled and roofed with a twining barrier
of twisting roots

   a faint bluish light filtered through the
tiny interstices between the carvings as
though they had been overlaid on a surface
that held a light of its own

  some instinct made boyce move his hand
to his hip but the sword was gone taken
from him no doubt during his captivity to
irathe but he did not want to think of her

  he could not go back and the huntsman
might soon wake unless the blood-scent
had roused the pack to hunger

  quietly boyce moved along the passage
ihe twining coils on the wall and ceiling
were motionless yet a feeling of tingling
awareness of the presence of some monstrous
danger never left him for a moment as
though he walked close beside a veil that
might at any moment be ripped aside that
already rippled with a little wind that blew
from an unknown and very terrible place

  nerves-well he had reason to feel nerv-
ous his harsh grin broadened to be
plunged from his normal life into the maze
	startling stories

of ancient alien sorcery and intrigue-suit-
able enough for a norman of guillaumes
era who walked amid witches and warlocks
and saracen magicians and believed in them
devoutly but boyce did not believe what
a superstition-reared crusader might ac-
cept blindly a modern man could not

  perhaps boyce thought he had been
accepting too much on faith he should have
questioned more from the beginning yet
his mind had not been entirely his own
he had been for the most part a tool in
irathes skilled hands and the huntsmans

  the stone carving of a beasts head was
set amid the tangled root-carvings at his
right the stone eyes watched blindly into
it-through it-the glittering coils seemed to
grow

   still the silence deepened

  he went on there were more carvings
to left and right some were animal others
human

  in the end he paused for a moment before
one of the stone masks he studied it a
root grew through the jaw deforming the
face curiously but it was carved from a
different material than the other gray gran-
ite masks boyce had seen and under the
coiling tendrils he could trace the shadowy
outline of a body

  the sculptor had even suggested the de-
tails of iris and pupil in the open eyes of the
mask it looked like   it was like  

  the stone lips moved

  painfully half-articulately with a dry
stone clicking that was infinitely horrible-
the head spoke

  boyce it groaned-and the stone tongue
clicked on the name against stone teeth
boyce

  now boyce knew the face and realized
what end had come to godfrey morel
though the end had not yet quite come

he reached for the loathsomely cling-
ing root-carvings but that inhuman
voice halted him

  stay do not touch the walls do not

  boyce knew that he was shivering he
licked his dry bps

  godfrey he said what-isnt there-

  listen godfrey morel said with his
stone tongue very soon i shall be-silent
before then   the clicking died

  what can i do boyce asked hoarsely
those things-

  i am part of them already godfrey

said part of it it is a plant hell-spawned
a devils plant here are its roots but
through all the city within the walls be-
neath the floors the tendrils have grown
secretly it is jamais plant-his spy

  jamai

  a devil-thing godfrey said his voice
strengthening with its aid he knows all
the citys secrets within the walls its ten-
drils glow-listen-see-and when jamai
comes here it answers his questions i have
seen that happen it must be fed sometimes
on the brains of living things or it will re-
lapse into an ordinary plant he made it
long ago-with his sorceries

  sorcery it was easy to accept that ex-
planation in this haunted blue twilight but
since boyce had seen the huntsmans vul-
nerability he was not so ready to believe
there were tropisms in plants-hypersensi-
tivity-plants that could in effect see and
hear and sense vibrations even in burbanks
day the study of plant-mutations had been
understood

  under certain abnormal stimuli such a
monstrous thing as this was theoretically
possible-a hypersensitive plant amenable
to directed control that absorbed brain-
tissue and perhaps the energy of the mind
itself a specified plant that could be con-
trolled like a machine

  theoretically it was possible but that did
not lessen the horror of the monstrosity
boyce felt faintly sick as he stared at the
chalky stiff face on the wall above him

  i am nearly a part of-this thing god-
frey morel said i have learned-something
of what it knows only in a few parts of the
city does counter-magic keep this hell-thing
away it cannot enter the kings palace

  the oracle comes here jamai will try
to kill her irathe-hates the oracle there
is one power in the city that     the
voice stopped after a moment it began
again less clearly

  hard to-speak go to the king i think
-he can help-hates irathe as she-hates
him tell him-jamai is bringing the oracle
here   

  wait boyce said its the huntsman-

  you have just come-from jamai

  no godfrey youre wrong ive come
from the huntsman

  the huntsman-is jamal the same

  a cry burst thickly from the masks
gaping mouth

  under the dragon mask-secret way to
lands of the earthquake	

the king-quick quick

   the face was stone

  godfrey boyce said-and then shouted
the name godfrey

   stone eyes stared at him

   silence brimmed the blue tunnel

  boyce went on the sickness was still
deep within him but the fact that now he
had some sort of goal gave him strength
he had learned little enough from godfrey
morel but he guessed that the king of this
haunted city might be a friend or at least
an enemy of his enemies

  irathe and the oracle were the same-or
had been once the sorcerer king might
hate irathe but would he hate the oracle

  and the huntsman-jamai boyce tried
to understand that it seemed meaningless
why should the huntsman masquerade as
jamai or vice versa why   

  huntsman or jamai or both if the man
recovered from boyces stunning blow he
would pursue and with the pack boyce
moved faster along the blue passage

  in the end he found the dragon mask it
was stone no such creature had ever existed
on earth it was the prototype of ancient
woodcuts boyce had seen though how the
artists had found their source he could not
guess the monstrous snarling mask loomed
above him jutting out into the passage
blocking it so that he had to sidle past care-
fully to avoid touching the glittering walls
with their festoons of roots

  knowing what he did now boyce was
more anxious than ever to avoid contact
with the bright unmoving tendrils that were
the hungry roots of the plant-mutation jamai
had created

the dragon mask was enormous its
lower jaw resting on the stone floor its
scaled snout three feet above boyces head
he could have walked into that incredible
gaping mouth all around the mask grew
the roots if a secret way existed here boyce
wondered how it could be opened without
touching the walls perhaps here the twin-
ing coils were harmless-but he did not
think so when his shoulder brushed those
bas-relief festoons his flesh shrank

  all around the dragon-mask the tendrils
coiled but within that yawning mouth   

  he peered in the blue glow did not pen-
etrate far surely if this were the opening
to another passage the huntsman-jamai-
would have discovered it before this

   shrinking a little he stepped into the
 dragons mouth before him now he could
 see a curtain of the stony roots-the wall
 disappointment flooded him

   as he turned to step out the irregular
 surface beneath his feet betrayed him he
 stumbled caught blindly at the nearest
 object-

   he caught himself but too late his hand
 had touched the wall

   it had not there had been no feeling of
 substance against his palm that meant-

   gingerly he reached out again the wall
 was visible but intangible his hand and
 arm melted through those stony tendrils he
 could see only dimly

   he put out a tentative foot there was a
 floor beyond the wall

  he stepped through the barrier into a
soundless lightless blackness

   that lasted only for an instant almost
 immediately he was conscious of swift mo-
 tion wind blew against him strongly yet
 the movement was erratic as though he
 stood in a car that was racing in a secret
 path through the heart of the city bound
 for a destination he could only guess had
 the king built this-whatever it was-so he
 could spy on jamai

   the swift motion halted- light came pale
 and colorless boyce stood in a tiny feature-
 less cubicle like a small elevator only for
 a moment did the white walls prison him
 then a gap widened before him

  before him was the throne-room of a
king-or a god

   it was the room the huntsman had shown
 him in a vision double pillars marched the
 length of it to the great black and scarlet
 throne at the end where a crowned figure
 sat motionless

   but now there was more to see than the
 huntsmans glass had revealed the room
 was enormous and in place of roof and walls
 a gigantic hemisphere transparent as glass
 covered it like a bubble below boyce could
 see the domes and smaller places of the
 sorcerers city mists shielded the distances
 but there was a brief glimpse gone before
 he could focus on it of kerak gray and
 small in the distance on its crag

   he had eyes only for the king the same
 bearded figure crowned and robed in yellow
 that he remembered from the vision

  warily he walked forward between the
great columns he could see his reflection
in the shining black floor-not bis own re-
	startling stories

flection but that of guillaume du bois
scowling and scarred guillaume himself
would have wanted a swords hilt in his hand
at this moment and curiously boyce felt
his own palm itch for the same comforting
feeling but he was unarmed

 the man on the throne made no move
his eyes watched boyce there was no
sound but the heavy tread of boyces feet

  closer he came and closer he stood be-
fore the throne

  go go at once the king said his voice
held no shadow of emotion it was utterly
cold completely depersonalized

 boyce swallowed he shook his head
stubbornly king or no king sorcerer or
scientist or man he would not go until-

  go at once you will be summoned when
i am ready go now

boyce set his jaw and took a step for-
ward the man on the throne lifted
a hand in warning and now boyce was
able to see as the wide sleeve was raised
that across the kings knees lay a bared
sword shining with cold steely radiance
but the king did not touch the sword

  if you come closer to me you will die
the dispassionate voice said

  the yellow robe was stretched taut against
the kings breast a design was embroidered
there a pattern of hieroglyphics boyce
could not read his attention was drawn
briefly to that design-and he stared not
quite believing what he saw

  then he took another step forward the
man on the throne did not move even when
boyce laid his palm on the satin robe

 there was no heart-beat through the
yellow thick fabric the chill of cold flesh
was perceptible

  even then boyce could not believe until
he held the steel sword-blade to the kings
lips that mirror surface did not cloud

  you are the first man in this world to
learn the truth irathes voice said no
one else would have dared approach the
throne her laughter sounded as boyce
turned shifting his hand from the swords
blade to its hilt

  she stood near him her red mouth smiling
her eyes faintly mocking she wore a long
robe now and the iron crown was on her
head the black floor reflected her and
boyce remembered the vision the huntsman
had shown him-a woman sundered broken
into two women-irathe and the oracle-

by an unknown science

  yes the oracle of kerak she said i
think i have won this game even though
jamai threw the dice first id never hoped
for this much-that i could bring the oracle
here jamai has nearly earned my gratitude

  boyce looked at her coolly he took out
the crystalline gem and cradled it in his
palm

  i think this gives you power over me
irathe he said suppose i smash it

  if you like she said indifferently
shrugging you cant return to your own
world without it and i have not as much
power over you as you think

  she nodded toward the king

  i could destroy you now if i wanted
but i may need you youve fulfilled my
purpose youve also found out that the
king my father is dead and that must be
kept secret unless-

  dead

  he died long ago

  after you were made into two women

  irathe looked at him steadily

  so you know that the huntsman i
suppose-jamai yes it was after that that
my father died he tried to use knowledge
that only they can use so he died

  but i have certain skills of my own the
king died but a body can be controlled like
a mind by an outside source for my pur-
poses the king had to remain alive she
smiled again call it hypnosis or believe
that the body on the throne before you is a
robot i can control it make it act and speak
as i wish

  you were controlling it just now boyce
said

  no it automatically says and does cer-
tain things when anyone enters here it
spoke to you eh had you been a man of
the city you would have obeyed and fled
even jamai has never dared approach the
king

  ill keep the crystal irathe i mean to
go back-when i can but stay out of my
mind you and the huntsman

  irathe moved her slim shoulders in a
gesture boyce could not interpret

  jamai what devils move him i won-
der beside the devils of his own mind i
think he is mad when the oracle and i
were one he loved me then afterward-he
still loved me but it was not enough do
you know why she looked at boyce
through her lashes half-smiling
lands of the earthquake	sh

  yes he knew old legends had given him
the answer stories of angel and demon
battling for a mans soul the allegory of
jekyll and hyde and a hundred other such
tales

chapter xiv
ice and fire

for irathe was evil not immoral-on
the contrary she was completely free
unshackled by any bonds of conscience or
remorse or empathy she was as amoral as
the inhuman creatures which had created
her from a whole woman

  good and evil inextricably mingled in
the human mind each a check and balance
upon the other-necessary to each other
and never to be separated except by a
science utterly behind the comprehension
of man

  but that separation had taken place the
oracle no less than irathe was monstrous
psychiatry had dealt with cases of schizo-
phrenia split personality in which there
were two inhabitants of a single mind
sometimes one personality was pure as a
saint the other utterly vicious and evil

  but here the fission was complete the
negative and positive in the girls mind and
soul and body had been separated no man
boyce thought could love irathe without
going mad for he knew now that she was
not human

  yes he said quietly i know why the
huntsman couldnt-why it isnt enough
when i loved you irathe you werent like
this

  no once each cycle the oracle and i
blend for a little while we are one again
but i still maintain my power i am domi-
nant i have control-with certain restric-
tions and while we are in one body thus
i cannot harm her without harming myself
afterwards when we separate again i am
tranced for a while by the time i recover
she is back in kerak where i cannot reach
her

  boyce nodded

  on earth then-

  we were in one body but i have been
in many worlds only when we were in one
body because i needed her i said i could
not harm her here the cage of fire and

  other things prevent me i could not reach
her in kerak

  do you want to kill her

  he thought irathe paled a little

  no she is part of me even though we
are in separate bodies harm to her would
be harm to me but i-i am not safe sup-
pose she and i were made one again for-
ever

  she held up her hand to stop boyce

  no as i am now i want to be always
free to do as i want free to open the gate-
ways of the universe if i wish-to rule to
wield power to feel no sorrow if she and
i are one again and i not dominant-her
foolish emotions her shallow conscience
halting me from my will-no  rule here

   i know a way to prison the oracle forever
where no one can reach her and where she
can never harm me till now i could not
summon her from kerak except during the
cycles when i dared not move because we
were one

  with you in control i see it wasnt you
i knew cm earth then-

  you knew us both in one body i have
searched through worlds and worlds trying
to find a key to kerak to the oracle for i
had to gain entrance there and learn some-
thing of her secrets something of how tan-
cred protected her and how strong he had
become

  as myself i could not go nor in the
minds of any who would help me for the
oracle can read mens minds her violet
eyes looked at boyce sidelong slyly with
triumph in them

  i found a way i found a double way
at last the simple idea came to me that was
easiest of all-to find someone she would
love she loved you william boyce i knew
that she and i in a single body forever
divided in our minds but sharing the same
flesh-oh i knew her thoughts something
bad touched her icy frozen heart at last

i lingered in your world until i was sure
when her lover-her husband-called i
knew she would come

  irathes laughter was sweet and cold

  i lingered until i knew i had wakened
in you too the same fire and until i was
sure your mind held the knowledge of how
to come here and the passion to follow but
then-then william boyce all your know-
ledge had to be erased from the surface of
your memory you see why

if you had gone into kerak knowing what
	startling stories

you do now the oracle would have recog-
nized her danger and tancred would have
done with you as he has done with many of
my envoys so when my work was finished-
i summoned them to my aid i knew their
presence was enough to drive all memory
of me and of our year together deep deep
into the wells of the subconscious in your
mind

  if you are wise youll leave them there
my purpose is served now though jamai
tricked me and used the crystal you carry
to invade your mind before me yet he has
done my work the oracle comes blindly
into my hands soon now soon the long
wait will be ended

  she smiled at him sweetly

  i want your help she said i have told
you that each cycle the oracle and  become
one again in the past i have been dominant
but she grows stronger some day i think
she may gain control-and find a way to con-
quer me to make me subservient forever
in the same body with her that must not
happen you will help me to prison her if
i need your help and in return-

she met his eyes squarely boyce leaned
on the sword and waited unsmiling

  instead of an image of ice-something
better the whole complete irathe you can
never know again and that ice image-you
would die of cold she said and suddenly
laughed a wild reckless gleeful laughter
that echoed shrilly from the pillars with
me in your arms william boyce-you would
not think of ice

  she took another step toward him he
still leaned on the sword conscious of the
intense attraction he felt toward her of the
exotic appeal of her slim vibrant body

  jamai tried that didnt he he said
softly

  her mouth twisted her beauty failed for
an instant as the mockery of a devil showed
in her eyes

  yes he tried she said he had loved
both of us when we were in one body before
my father worked his magic with them it
would have been better had i erased his
memory as i erased yours for jamai
remembered me as i was and yet he could
not help but love me and i am-what am
i william boyce

  the sword hilt was cold against his palms
he spoke hoarsely

  i dont know but i know youre some-

thing that never should have existed a
man-a woman-is supposed to be a mixture
of good and evil if thats the way to put it
maybe the crusaders werent so supersti-
tious when they wrote about lamias-
demon-women no man could love you
irathe without going mad if the oracle is
ice you are flame that destroys all it touches

  then jamai is mad she said perhaps
his mind split as my body and soul did
perhaps he tried to create two selves as
they did to me but only they have such
power when a mind splits thus it is mad-
ness sometimes jamai is jamai and hates
me and hates the oracle and wishes to de-
stroy us both

  sometimes he is the huntsman and does
not care and would not care if this world
ended now but he loved me before they
worked their spell and he is bound to me-
to irathe-by unbreakable bonds-and he
must die i cannot trust that windvane mind
of his

  she put out a hand and touched the sword
boyce held

  you will help me if you can have noth-
ing else-am  not desirable look upon
this frozen love of yours-and decide

  her arm swept out boyces gaze followed
the gesture

  down the long pillared avenue toward the
throne the oracle of kerak came slowly
her hands were clasped before her her eyes
were still closed the marble hair lay smooth-
ly upon the marble shoulders she walked
serenely surely toward him as if her mind
had clearer vision than her unseeing eyes

  and now he could see that these two
women were indeed the same fire and ice
good and evil-and more than that deeper
than simple morality it was positive and
negative each complete-and each unearthly

  but the good was less earthly than the
evil

  she came straight to where boyce stood
she paused and then for the first time he
saw the lashes flicker on her cheeks the
white lids rose her eyes were blue-ice
blue the color that lingers deep within frozen
bergs but more than ice was here now

  far down deeply buried he thought he
saw a stirring of-life awareness there
was a mind within this icy statue prisoned
inside it as the body had been prisoned in
fire until he called her under jamais com-
mand and the mind-remembered

  boyce was shaken to his depths he loved
lands of the earthquake	

both women when they were one now they
were two in bewilderment he realized that
each woman drew him but in such different
ways that for an instant he felt a shocking
disorientation as though the glass walls
beyond him had drawn apart-more than
that-as though he himself was being split
into two parts

  black garden of evil-scented with the
poisonous perfume of flowers ablaze with
sensuous color-promising untold desire ful-
filled a madness of ecstasy such as man had
never known-

  goddess of shining crystal pure and re-
mote as the stars-a distant flame behind
the cold blue eyes hinting at a love that was
far and veiled by walls of ice-

  side by side they stood those two who
had been one

  and one promised more than any man
had ever known

  you are my husband you are my lover
you wedded me as well as that frozen god-
dess we will walk through worlds of
flame and color and sound under seas of
nameless planets beyond the gates of space
and time death or madness will not matter
we will plumb the last uttermost limits of
power and rule here like god and goddess

  but the distant ember behind the ice in
the oracles eyes promised nothing it asked
nothing

  it said-i love you and that was all

irathe saw boyces face change she
saw him step forward and face her
guarding the oracle with his own body
bitter mockery made the red mouth ugly

  you eould have helped me she said
poftly there is danger now but since
you will not aid there is no other way this
means your death-you fool

  her gaze focused beyond boyce she
made a quick intricate movement with her
hands while her whole slim figure tensed
into a rigid statue then instantly she had
relaxed

  they are coming she said i have
summoned them before their time-before
the cycle has been completed there is
danger in that

  boyce shifted the sword in his right hand
irathe laughed

  a sword against-them

  no boyce said against you irathe
the blade lifted-bung poised to slash her
throat

  she faced him unafraid

  what of your love then harm me-and
she will be harmed kill me and she dies
boyce lowered the sword

  unless youre lying

  try it and see do you dare

  no he said but i can go back to my
own world i still have that crystal i can
take her with me

   try it

  he turned away the oracle followed
willingly enough though her face was void
of expression he glanced back at irathe
and saw something in her eyes that made
him halt

  wait she said the crystal-

   he took a long stride back toward her the
sword raised again

   id forgotten you were trying to control
me through it werent you but- he
hesitated you couldnt do it is that it
youve lost your power

  not while you live irathe blazed at
him i am not that weak

  you tried to control my mind he said
and it didnt work why

  there was something fighting against
me   i have felt that ever since you came
to the throne-room i-listen

  the air shivered around them a thin
high keening sound rang in boyces ears
like that ringing in the head which cannot
be shaken away now it grew louder clearer
there was in it the tinkling of tiny bells
and a faint chill like no chill he had ever
felt except when-

  they come irathe cried sooner than
i thought oh theres danger here for you
both-for everyone but me her laughter
was high and triumphant and boyce had the
fleeting thought that in its sound he heard
something of tinkling sweetness like the bells
they rang already she laughed with a
voice like theirs

   the floor shook

  irathe glanced at the oracle standing
serenely hands clasped icy eyes upon boyce
with a flicker of fire behind the ice as if
memory might be flowing slowly softly back
into that frozen mind

  the bond is weaker between kerak and
the city while she remains here irathe
said abstractedly you feel that a pitch-
ing like the roll of waves under the city
these lands have been pent up a long while
as the city rode at anchor with kerak for a
mooring she laughed agbin recklessly
	startling stories

what a storm underfoot we should have if
the mooring snapped

  darkness was gathering in the air of the
room boyce glanced up and saw through the
great glass dome above them a scurry of
motion in the city men and women hurry-
ing to shelter in any palace or temple or
tavern that would receive them the streets
were clearing for them

  now we shall finish irathe cried they
come who made me into two-and who will
enchain this one of me so that she can never
again hope to control my mind she leaned
closer and her red lip curled up in a scornful
smile as she gazed into her own face frozen
to the color of ice and marble

  you thought to rule me she said softly
oh i knew your thoughts remember we
were one when this man loved us i could
feel your treachery moving beneath my own
mind like snakes squirming underfoot you
thought to build up the power that could
take control from me when we are next made
one oh yes i know why it was love that
woke your envy of my strength love for
him hes mine now

  listen-you hear the bells they come
who split us into two-and will deal at my
command with you prepare yourself my
sister-my more than sister these moments
are your last are you ready for the en-
chantment that will make you forever the
marble thing you now only seem to be

         chapter xv
         the way back

she swung to boyce her black hair
flying wide her face was a blaze of
triumph and joyous evil her eyes upon his
were a violet flame in the darkness and the
chill of the room they sought his eyes
fixed there-he felt an irresistible pull as if
she were drawing out his very mind through
the meeting of their gaze blackness darker
than the gathering gloom around them swam
through his brain and then-

  laughter echoed through the great hail
they turned even the oracle boyce was
dizzy for an instant at the sudden release
of the bond between irathes gaze and his
then he saw down the long aisle a motion
among the pillars as the wild laughter rang
out again he saw the tiger-beasts of the
huntsman sliding toward them with their

beautiful pouring motion golden eyes lam-
bent in the dimness

  behind them leaning on the leash the
huntsman same in his tiger-striped garments
blood smeared his pale face and he was
laughing as he came-but not from mirth
boyce remembered irathes words yes it
might be madness that wild mirthless sound
that echoed among the pillars but a cold
madness that knew its own power

  it was you then-in the crystal-fighting
my will irathe cried furiously you dared
jamai-

  he came on laughing deep in his throat
i was it jamai or was it the huntsman
i have two selves irathe even as you you
should know that william boyce i owe
you thanks never before have i found the
secret way to the throne till i looked into
your mind through the crystal i had not
known that the king was dead i had not
even known that i was dead

  jamai irathe shrilled

  even you irathe are vulnerable you
are afraid all of us are afraid of something
-death or pain or magic because you are
sane-even you irathe-but i have lost my
vulnerability i had not known it before
but i know now

  how can a man love good and evil-fire
and ice-and stay sane you were wise to
make the choice you did it meant death but
death is better than life i made the other
choice i have followed irathe through all
the hells in all the universe

  a shadow darkened above the crystal
globe the white mists gathered closer over-
head clustering about the hemisphere to
hide the citys roofs below kerak far and
small was hidden by the pallid veils
jamai irathe cried again and he smiled
no irathe he said his voice dropping
it is the end i love you and i love the
oracle i will not see her enslaved to your
evil will i know what evil is in you

  but i would not see her gain power over
you again because then she would look at
me and know the evil that has flowered
within me since she saw me last both you
and she must die irathe-and for all i care
all the worlds may die with you

  irathes mouth curved i have summoned
them you are too late-much too late

  the shadow was like thunderheads above
the crystal roof darkening the great room
jamai roared with laughter

  let them come he shouted let them
lands of the earthquake	

day i know the answer now-and it is
death kill and be killed i am wiser than
you all for i am mad-and i say the answer
is death

  it was almost too dark now to see but
boyce could make out the sudden upward
sweep of a tiger-striped arm and the whip
of the loosened leash and he could see the
instantaneous forward sweep of the two
long low powerful bodies at the huntsmans
knee his laughter seemed to madden them
and their screaming snarl of rage echoed the
curious snarl in his own voice as they
launched themselves forward toward the
throne where the dead king sat

  dimly boyce saw the beautiful screaming
faces of the beasts met the glow of their
luminous eyes-and sprang forward before
the oracle swinging his sword

  it was too dark to see the tiger-things
though they were almost upon him it was
too dark to see the two girls or the throne
or the pillars and the huntsmans mad
laughter rang disembodied through the
blackness there was a singing in boyces
ears a sound of tiny bells very near  

  a hot-breathed snarl sounded in his face
he heard claws click on pavement as the
beast launched itself at his throat of itself
the sword swung in his hands it met hard
muscular resistance that held for a moment
and then seemed to fall away left and right
over the razor-edge of the blade

  there was a sudden hot reek of blood in
the air but he was scarcely aware of it
for now shadows moved through the dark
and it seemed to boyce that his flesh moved
with them shudderingly on his bones cold
struck into his mind and his body numbing
paralyzing   

an icy wind rushed past him swaying
the darklike curtains before it brief-
ly dimly the dark parted he saw in one
terrible glancing flash a robed figure moving
as no human figure ever moved

  he saw irathe facing it her arms flung
high her black hair swirling wide on the
blast her face dazzling he saw one more
thing-a second snarling figure before him
crouching for a leap lips wrinkled back over
curved fangs as it glared at him out of wild
mad eyes

  then the darkness closed in again like
dropping curtains through it he could hear
irathes voice high and shrill speaking
words whose very sound was a meaningless

blasphemy to the ear no human tongue
was ever meant to shape such sounds

  the chant rose higher thinner like the
were cramped like ice around the hilt of his
ears and his brain except when the shriek
of that icy wind drowned them out

  the cold was in his bones now his hands
were cramped like ice around the hilt of nis
sword hearing that feral snarl he swung
it up with infinite effort a lithe beast-
smelling body thudded against him claws
raked his thigh and the snarl was in his
very ear furiously struggling against the
cold he flung it off slashing downward-
missed

  now the chant of irathes strangely
changed voice resonant with that insistent
bell-sound filled all the darkness and he
sensed even through the cold and his con-
fusion a motion among the robed unseen
figures-a motion he knew because his flesh
told him by its shuddering shrink when
they drew near

  with one ast despairing effort he lifted
the sword as he heard that snarl again this
time it struck home the snarl was a howl
a body thudded to the floor and was silent
the figures were closing in around him and
he knew that when they reached him he
would die

  one last thing remained he could not
reach irathe to silence her triumphant chant
but the oracle stood at his back he could
reach her

  he could kill her

  she at least need never be captive again
to the black evil of her twin self and if the
oracle died-perhaps-irathe too might die
it was a forlorn and desperate thing he
meant to do but he knew in his frozen
horror and revulsion that it was best for
them all

  she was very near within reach of his
arm he touched her-for the first time
he had wondered often before now if she
would be marble to the touch cold hard
she was not cold for an instant it bewil-
dered him and then he knew he was him-
self so paralyzingly cold in this unnatural
icy dark that even marble might seem warm
to him

  and as he drew her toward him his arm
closing about her shoulders he felt her
giving slowly almost reluctantly to his pull
her body bending as he brought her within
reach of his sword

  he shortened his grip upon it in the
	startling stories

deadly dark he laid its sharp edge against
her throat

  she did not stir but he could hear her
quickened breathing

  very gently he bent his head and kissed
her for the first time and the last his con-
scious memory would ever know and under
his lips he felt warmth and life come slowly
back into the oracle of kerak slowly
softly out of that distant place in which she
had dwelt so long the oracle of kerak re-
turned to the world of the living

  against his mouth her lips moved against
his heart her heart stirred-beat more
strongly in his arms her body that had been
marble relaxed into flexible living flesh
the tie between them which irathe herself
had brought into being was a cord that drew
her irresistibly through the gates of forget-
fulness and enchantment she stirred
sighed-

  the spell broke

  she wrenched free and was gone into the
darkness and as she moved it seemed to
boyce that irathes voice faltered for an
instant assurance went out of it and she
stumbled in the midst of a phrase suddenly
he thought he understood they were the
two halves of a single being

  irathe in all her vivid aliveness had drained
from that other self the very stuff of life
itself when living returned to the oracle it
could come from no other source than irathe
she must have felt her own power sink
within her at the abrupt upward surge of
strength in the oracle

  now suddenly in the icy darkness a new
voice sounded-a clear cool voice very sure
chanting that blasphemous tongue which
irathe still spoke almost in chorus for a
moment the two voices chanted one cool
and not strong but gaining in strength the
other rich and high brimming with passion
-but fading a little as the new tones
sounded through the dark

  but it was not a chorus strophe and
antistrophe rang through the icy hall and
at the chant of that new clear speech boyce
thought the cold began to ebb a little he
could move again-not much but a little
blindly he stumbled forward

voice fought against voice the two
who had been one woman battled in the
dark and boyce knew now the truth behind
that battle for irathe was not after all the
one human creature who could command

them she was only half of that one being
who alone spoke their tongue with human
lips the oracle too knew the chant knew
they must obey it and in the dark the
oracle chanted on her voice gaining little
by little in volume as it strove with irathes

 groping boyce touched something warm
and breathing even in the darkness he
could not be mistaken who it was he
seized her waist and irathe struck out at
him fiercely pausing in her chant the
oracles voice soared instantly in the pause
strength surging up in it

 boyces arms swept around irathe her
nails ripped his cheek he dragged her close
prisoning her arms one palm clamping
across her mouth it was like holding one
of the tiger-beasts her knee drove up
viciously she writhed in his arms and he
tightened his grasp until it seemed as though
her ribs must collapse under the pressure
but she could not speak

  the oracles voice poured forth that in-
human chant clear and strong it was a
command-and an entreaty

 darkness was paling around them over
irathes twisting head boycc saw robed
figures moving in an intricate ritual about
the marble-white girl whose voice still
echoed through the room he saw and looked
away setting his teeth against the shudders
that racked him whenever his eyes even
glancingly crossed those hidden shapes

 but something was happening

  in his arms irathe suddenly froze some-
thing brushed past a touch that exhaled
cold and boyce was for a moment weak with
horror at the touch then a single ringing
sound like a struck gong vibrated through
the lifting dimness

 and from boyces arms he felt irathe-
melt   

 when he could see again the room was
clear he was not wholly aware of the great
surging lift and fall of the floor beneath
him for one thing held his gaze like a spell
of sorcery and there was sorcery indeed
in her violet eyes and the vividness of the
smiling face beneath her iron crown

 lido you know me now-my dear oh my
dear-do you know me now

 he was not sure of his own body any
more he took one forward step as the
floor pitched beneath him not daring to
believe the strange evidence of his own
stunned mind

  we are one again now the sweet famil-
lands of the earthquake	

iar voice was saying and he did remember
from long ago and from another world his
heart was beating suffocatingly as he crossed
the heaving floor toward her holding out
uncertain hands

  her warm fingers clasped them it was the
face he knew tilting to his now-vivid and
alive as irathe yes potent for evil as irathe
-but not evil all the strength was there
but under the control the oracle had al-
ways known

  she thrust herself between his arms and
laid the crowned head back to lift her lips
to his smiling as she had smiled so long
ago on earth

 yes he remembered now this was the
real irathe    

  the pitch of the floor beneath them inter-
rupted the kiss she drew back and looked
anxiously about them

 we must go she said i wish-but
unless you mean to stay here forever we
must go quickly

 he followed her glance through the
crystal ceiling clear now except for the
drift of mist outside he could see the city
roofs and the mountains beyond them with
kerak crowning the heights and kerak was
slipping slowly backward the mountains
moved-no not the mountains but the city

  the bond is broken the girl in his arms
said he could not quite think of her as
irathe though he knew it was truly her
name now im no longer an anchor to hold
the city here and the tide is pulling us out
and away what do you think we should
do william boyce

 he dropped one arm from her to touch
his belt where a faint chill from the crystal
struck through his clothing yes it was
still there

  go back he said back to earth if we
can

  she nodded

  yes i hoped for that this city is no
place for me now my place is with you-if
you want that

  he grinned and dropped his head to re-
assure her but she smiled pushing him
gently away

  later later my darling we-look

 he turned his head then in an awed
voice he said jamai

  and yet it was no startling thing he saw
terrible yes and tragic but somehow not
strange in this strange and lawless place

  on the high throne of the sorcerer king

the huntsman sat the kings yellow-robed
body lay at his feet on the heaving floor the
huntsmans chin was on his chest and his
face was turned toward them as they stood
before the throne but the huntsmans eyes
did not see them his eyes were fixed upon
the bright face of madness and he saw no
other sight

  they left him there stumbling as they
went over the pitching floor his dead beasts
lying about the throne and the dead king
at his feet

through the mist they stumbled over
ground that swelled and sank beneath
their feet like the tides of a solid sea great
gaps opened and closed again with a scream-
ing of rock far underground the depths
groaned beneath them

  hurry boyce heard himself gasp as the
ground shook itself and rose in a moun-
tainous billow that sank as they began the
climb up its slope it isnt far now-only a
little way i remember that diff its the
one i came through

  i think-its steadier now irathe panted
the ground-its rising into the foothills
here only the valley-flows

  wreathed in mist they climbed and it
was true that as the rocky hillside rose
underfoot the billowing subsided once
they paused and looked back far away
gleaming with jeweled lights glittering with
enchantment they saw the warlocks city
drifting like a ship into the misty distances
pitching on the land waves that surged in
long quakes around it and beyond the city
kerak

  high on the crags the great castle stood
its scarlet banner blowing above it like a
flame other lands would drift through
this valley at its feet other cities and people
would know tancred and guillaume du
bois who was boyces distant forebear and
would never know it kerak he thought
would sit through an uncounted forever on
its crag while the drifting lands flowed slowly
by carrying unknown adventures past its
gates

  they turned and climbed again

  here-no farther here i think boyce
searched the ledges with anxious eyes in-
credible to think that just beyond one of
them his own world lay he caught a glint
of something and bent close to look

  yes this is it see the glass i broke
when i came through


startling stories

  it lay on the ground in glittering frag-
ments that crackled underfoot boyce fum-
bled in his belt brought out the small cold
crystal whose chill struck into his palm as
he held it

  wait irathe said the light- she
hesitated then smiled suddenly at him i
promised myself i would work no more
sorcery but for this one time we have
need of sorcery my dear see

  she held up her hand flexed the fingers
once twice then between thumb and fore-
finger she seemed to hold a tiny flame
quick while it burns

  boyce lifted the crystal the fire struck
through it fell in shining patterns on the
stone-sank into it slowly the window
formed that was a gateway into other worlds

  once more for the last time boyce looked
behind him the city was a stain on the
mist far away riding the quaking lands into
new harbors its lights glittering faintly
through the fog grim changeless kerak
looked out across this strange world where

space was fluid and time was not

unknown enchanted cities would always
drive past through the troubled earthquake
lands among the pale mists he would never
know these cities

 his mind lingered for one last strangely
 reluctant moment upon kerak where men
 of his own blood dwelt

 then irathe said come-now and took
 his hand

 the crystal loomed up before them on the
 rock with shadows behind it

 they felt the delicate tinkling shatter
 of the glass   

 shadow-tapestries swayed and rippled on
 the walls dim jewels gleamed from the
 unreal folds but through the rich hangings
 the bare dusty boards began to show

the tapestries were gone the empty
silent room was around them behind them
the wall showed no trace of the crystal
pattern

from the distance came the sound of
auto horns and a newsboys voice shouting

its the same tragedy all over again-and all because
of the lawson radiation

tr pollard regarded the patient solemnly john majors the
director of the laboratory watched the proceedings with breathless
anticipation but the man who sat before them seemed utterly unable
to answer the questions diat were asked of him

the physicist finally shrugged hopelessly this is no place for me-
he said if i can do anything-

you can do nothing majors said dr pollard as usual this case
is almost complete amnesia memory completely shot hell never be brilliant again
from i q  down to about  thats tough to take hell have to make new friends
for his old ones will find him dull

john majors shook his head in despair im going to abandon the lawson radiation
it gets us all its already taken four of my top technicians perhaps its because the
lawson radiation is no better understood now than it was thirty years ago

astonishing consequences follow in the wake of a deep scientific mystery in the
kingdom of thh blind the amazing complete novel by george

o	smith coming in our next issue its a novel that will hold you spell-
bound as you follow its strange and compelling events-and at the same
time fascinate you with its world-shaking scientific implications

the fate of the earth depends on the lawson radiation in the
kingdom of the blind-and there arc thrills and surprises on
every page look forward to a real scientifiction treat

proximo centauri here we come-on the good ship pegasus

ido like to wet down a sale the fat
man said happily raising his voice
above the sighing of the air-condi-
tioner drink up professor im two ahead
of you

  he glanced up from their table as the ele-
vator door opposite them opened a man
stepped out into the cool dark of the bar
and stood blinking as if he had just come
from the desert glare outside

 hey fred-fred nolan the fat man
called out come over he turned to his
guest man i met on the hop from new

fashioneds and another double manhattan
i guess i expected a comic book scientist
with a long white beard but now that ive
met you i cant figure out one thing

  which is

  well at your age you bury yourself in
this god-forsaken place-

  we couldnt build the pegasus on long
island appleby pointed out and this is
the ideal spot for the take off

  yeah sure but thats not it its-well
mind you i sell steel you want special
alloys for a starship i sell it to you but
just the same now that business is out of
the way why do you want to do it why try
to go to proxima centauri or any other
star

  appleby looked amused it cant be ex-
plained why do men try to climb mount
everest what took peary to the north
pole why did columbus get the queen to
	startling stories

hock her jewels nobody has ever been to
proxima centauri-so were going

  barnes turned to nolan do you get it
fred

  nolan shrugged i sell precision instru-
ments some people raise chrysanthemums
some build starships i sell instruments
barnes friendly face looked puzzled
well- the bartender put down their
drinks say pete tell me something would
you go along on the pegasvs expedition if
you could

  nope

 why not

  i like it here

 dr appleby nodded theres your an-
swer barnes in reverse some have the
columbus spirit and some havent

  its all very well to talk about colum-
bus barnes persisted but he expected to
come back you guys dont expect to sixty
years-you told me it would take sixty years
why you may not even live to get there
no but our children will and our
grandchildren will come back

  but- say youre not married
certainly i am family men only on the
expedition its a two-to-three generation
job you know that he hauled out a wal-
let theres mrs appleby with diane
diane is three and a half

  shes a pretty baby barnes said soberly
and passed it on to nolan who smiled at it
and handed it back to appleby barnes went
on what happens to her

she goes with us naturally you wouldnt
want her put in an orphanage would you
no but- barnes tossed off the rest of
his drink i dont get it he admitted
wholl have another drink

  not for me thanks appleby declined
finishing his more slowly and standing up
im due home family man you know he
smiled

barnes did not try to stop him he
said goodnight and watched appleby

leave

my round said nolan the same
huh yeah sure barnes stood up
lets get up to the bar fred where we
can drink properly i need about six
okay nolan agreed standing up
whats the trouble

  trouble did you see that picture
  well

  well how do you feel about it tm a

salesman too fred  sell steel it dont
matter what the customer wants to use it
for i sell it to him id sell a man a rope to
hang himself but i do love kids i cant
stand to think of that cute little kid going
along on that-that crazy expedition

  why not shes better off with her par-
ents shell get as used to steel decks as most
kids are to sidewalks

  but look fred you dont have any silly
idea theyll make it do you

  they might

  well they wont they dont stand a
chance i know i talked it over with our
technical staff before i left the home office
nine chances out of ten theyll burn up on
the take off thats the best that can happen
to them if they get out of the solar system
which aint likely theyll still never make it
theyll never reach the stars

  pete put another drink down in front of
barnes he drained it and said

  set up another one pete they cant
its a theoretical impossibility theyll freeze
-or theyll roast-or theyll starve but
thevtl never get there

  maybe so

  no maybe about it theyre crazy hurry
up with that drink pete have one your-
self

  coming up dont mind if i do thanks
pete mixed the cocktail drew a glass of
beer and joined them

  pete here is a wise man barnes said
confidentially you dont catch him mon-
keying around with any trips to the stars
columbus-pfui columbus was a dope he
shoulda stood in bed

  the bartender shook his head you got
me wrong mr barnes if it wasnt for men
like columbus we wouldnt be here today
-now would we im just not the explorer
type but im a believer i got nothing
against the pegasus expedition

  you dont approve of them taking kids
on it do you

  well    there were kids on the may-
flower so they tell me

  its not the same thing bames looked
at nolan then back to the bartender if
the lord had intended us to go to the stars
he would have equipped us with jet propul-
sion fix me another drink pete

  youve had about enough for a while mr
barnes

  the troubled fat man seemed about to
argue thought better of it
columbus was a dope	

  im going up to the sky room and find
somebody thatll dance with me he an-
nounced gnight he swayed softly to-
ward the elevator

  nolan watched him leave poor old
barnes he shrugged i guess you and i
are hard-hearted pete

  no i believe in progress thats all i
remember my old man wanted a law passed
about flying machines keep em from break-
ing their fool necks claimed nobody ever
could fly and the government should put a
stop to it he was wrong im not the ad-
venturous type myself but ive seen enough
people to know theyll try anything once
and thats how progress is made

  you dont look old enough to remember
when men couldnt fly

  ive been around a long time ten years
in this one spot

  ten years eh dont you ever get a
hankering for a job thatll let you breathe
a little fresh air

  nope i didnt get any fresh air when i
served drinks on forty-second street and 
dont miss it now i like it here always
something new going on here first the atom
laboratories and then the big observatory
and now the starship but thats not the
real reason i like it here its my home
watch this

  he picked up a brandy inhaler a great
fragile crystal globe spun it and threw it
straight up toward the ceiling it rose slow-
ly and gracefully paused for a long reluc-
tant wait at the top of its rise then settled
slowly slowly like a diver in a slow-motion
movie pete watched it float past his nose
then reached out with thumb and forefinger
nipped it easily by the stem and returned
it to the rack

  see that he said one-sixth gravity
when i was tending bar on earth my bunions
gave me the dickens all the time here i
weigh only thirty-five pounds i like it on

chapter i

party with dreams

the year was  the hour was mid-
night the place was ekadome city of
the martian rulers in a gorgeous pleas-
ure apartment high up on the cliff-like face
of a towering building that loomed above the

intersection of three canals an orgy was in
progress

  tne spacious high-domed room was bril-
liantly lighted by a ray that constantly
changed color now red now green now vio-
let this was the noted joylamp invented
by a mad scientist to administer a new and
unheard-of intoxication to all who came into
its light beneath it divans were spread and
cushions heaped and on these lolled the
pleasure seekers

  they drank potent liquors of both martian
and terrestrial distillation they listened to
the fascinating music they looked at die
three television screens on the walls where
were presented three entertaining dramas-
one a whimsical intellectual comedy one a
historical romance of ancient mars one a


of jupiter

stark horrible thing that made the head
swim and the heart race

  the majority of those present were lean
mahogany-colored martians their bulging
eyes and grinning teeth flashing against the
darkness of their thin-drawn almost mum-
my-like faces here and there were terres-
trial men and women easily recognizable by
their more robust physiques lighter com-
plexions and softer contours of face and
figure

  the music grew louder and wilder the
three shadowy dramas flashed away into
nothingness and from a black well in the
center of the room rose a platform on it
was the writhing form of a martian dancing

by

manly wadt wfuman

girl so fast were her rhythmic movements
that she seemed to shimmer to sprout new
arms and legs to turn into two or thee
dancers

  her performance was greeted with a storm
of applause and all watched closely the
ever-changing rays of the joy-lamp shone
down bringing wickedly delightful thrills to
every soul there even to the young man by
the door who wished he had not come

  he was a terrestrial perhaps twenty-five
years old more than six feet tall and of a
sinewy slimness his clear-cut tanned fea-
tures and the unruly locks of tawny hair
above were somehow familiar to every be-
holder although nobody knew him save the

companion who had brought him and to
whom he now turned

  i wouldnt have come if id have known
it was to be like this duvelskoe he said

  why-whats there to be afraid of pro-
tested the other he too was a terrestrial
shorter and sturdier than the first speaker
his face was young and handsome and
laughing topped with black curls and framed
in long sideburns that added to its look of
virile audacity

  whats to be afraid of he repeated the
best people of both worlds go to these parties
one doesnt think of them as folks would on
earth i wouldnt have brought you here if
it had been wrong

   its just that im not used to it persisted
the tall youth later perhaps when ive
made my report to headquarters and found
out about my new job

  you dont have to make your report until
tomorrow do you said duvelskoe any-
way im on the same job remember lets
make a real night of it old fellow

  he reached to a stand and took up two
metal goblets filled with liquor one of these
he handed to his friend the latter opened
his mouth to say something in further pro-
test when the cup was dashed from his hand
and a third person joined them

  at first glance the newcomer appeared
dark beautiful and more than a little intoxi-
cated at second glance she was a partic-
ularly splendid specimen of that fast-grow-
ing class the hybrid martio-terrestrials her
figure was delicately slender but not as ema-
ciated as that of a true martian her terres-
trial blood had diluted her complexion to a
pleasant tan well set off by her clouds of
midnight hair

  her features might have been a bit too
softly cut to suit martian tastes but to the
young terrestrials who now looked at her
they seemed of classic beauty for the rest
she was clad in a costly gown that accorded
to the latest fashion on earth and did not
trouble itself to hide the various rondures of
her shape

  she shook her head in mock earnestness at
the tall young man dont drink that stuff
she said youre just from home arent
you

  if you mean just from earth yes he
replied

  then let me give you a new sensation
she held out a jewelled hand in the palm
of which lay a little heap of gravish pow-
der its new to me too well bum it in
that brazier yonder the perfume from it is
guaranteed to make you dream that you are
anything from martian ruler and president
of the terrestrial league to night watch-
man in a girls boarding school lets give it
a try shall we

mve shook his tawny head thanks
 just the same this is my first night
on mars and ive never been to an affair
like this

  neither have i i came into the place
just fifteen minutes ago but what ive seen
of it makes me think im going to like it
come on show your sporting blood

  the dancer had finished her performance
and had sunk away with the platform the
audience turning in search of new diversion
saw the argument and gathered around to
watch in amusement or to add their voices
to that of the girls

  do as she asks you friend urged one
she seems to like you and we all like her
just be one of us plenty of fun here for
everybody and every taste

  i dont even know her said the tall
youth a little harassed

  thats easily remedied said the girl
my names thiana an ancient name in my
mothers family-she was martian whats
yours

  but he was turning away

youre too good for us she mocked
hes a long way from too good cried
a burly grizzled terrestrial on whom vari-
ous stimulants had wrought as far as im
concerned he isnt even good enough

   let it stand at that answered the young
man without turning around ill leave
til guarantee you will shouted the bur-
ly one leaping forward in another moment
he would have struck a blow on the back
of the unsuspecting head but duvelskoe
saw his intention and quickly interposing
himself drove a skilful right to the heavy
chin the other staggered backward into a
long slumping fall among the revellers

  for a moment there was silence then a
gust of laughter went up and several voices
urged the fallen man to get on his feet and
do battle he rose but hesitated cherishing
his bruised jaw

  if you knew who i was youd have
thought a long time before you did that
he snarled im thor harvison and i
manufacture the harvison space-ships i
drag a broad tail on both worlds young
man

   im glad to know you harvison retort-
ed duvelskoe in impudent good humor my
names shem duvelskoe as to your space-
ships ive operated them and very bad
space-ships they are it takes more of a man
to fly one than to make one

   delighted applause burst out nt this and
some of the watchers cried out afresh for
harvison to attack duvelskoe evidently en-
joying himself hugely shook his head when
his companion motioned him toward the door

  ill get a rawhiding from some bigwig
over this anyway he said let me give this
the disc-men of jupiter



man one of my own rawhidings first

  harvison snorted at that and bared two
hairy forearms he advanced stealthily put-
ting up his guard but just as duvelskoe
moved to meet him the door opened and
a sharp voice cried out for order

  at sight of the fit-looking middle-aged
terrestrial who entered silence fell upon the
gathering duvelskoe snapped out of his pos-
ture of defense and stiffened to salute har-
vison shrank back in a manner which as-
sured all who saw that however broad the
trail he dragged the newcomer dragged one
still broader for he was colonel jack still-
well an outstanding hero of the interplanet-
ary war of  and now head of the terres-
trial legation at ekadome and a power of
two worlds

  turn that thing off he snapped point-
ing at the joy-lamp somebody jumped to
do it and the dimming of its rays served to
sober the crowd still more next his eyes
fell upon the girl who had introduced her-
self as thiana he beckoned her to him with
a quick jerk of his head and she came for-
ward all of her sauciness gone

  you should have an old-fashioned spank-
ing daughter he said as soon as i heard
you were here i came to set you have you
used any of that powder in your hand

  she threw it away shaking her head

  so much the better see that you never
do so you have my leave to go

  she almost ran from the room followed
by several others duvelskoe made bold to
stammer some sort of explanation

  i didnt really know what kind of a party
it was sir i only thought to show my friend
here some martian night life

  your friend this man stillwell nod-
ded toward the tall one

  yes sir he is the officer who is to report
to you tomorrow for orders on the space
flight to jupiter

  oh yes said stillwell he offered his
hand to the young stranger his features re-
laxing into a smile

  then you are rolf bromburg descend-
ant of the first man to make a non-stop
flight around the world and the twenty-fifth

despite the officials cordial treatment the
night before he felt that he had been in-
troduced under most unsatisfactory condi-
tions

  however he made no effort to excuse
himself to his superior instead he attempt-
ed to explain that duvelskoe was blameless
in fighting harvison stillwell listened sym-
pathetically

  duvelskoe is of a mixed descent and his
wild instincts get him into trouble some-
times the older man said at length but
i agree with you that he could have done
nothing else in this case he wont suffer
for it i promise you but lets get to busi-
ness you know what you are to do for me

  only what was said on my order sheet
i understand that i was to attempt a flight
to the planet jupiter with duvelskoe as my
lieutenant

  thats right but that isnt the whole
story said stillwell you know captain
i am glad you had an opportunity to visit
that party last night

  bromburg only looked his amazement

  i see you dont understand perhaps id
better explain that every day and every hour
there are scores hundreds even thousands of
such parties in progress youll find a few
terrestrials there thrill-seeking but the
majority are martians

they have the old philosophy of eat
drink and be merry for tomorrow we die
as their one guide and tomorrow we die
means not only this individual or that it
means their whole world

he pointed to a map of mars on the wall
you know the story that is told there
you studied it in school the oceans of mars
are dried up the land is all desert except
where irrigation and intensive cultivation are
	startling tries

practised and even these shall pass away
before long water and plant life and air
will vanish from mars and there will re-
main a deserted silent globe spinning in
space

  the martians know that and the end of
a world is a dreadful thtng to contemplate
once they wanted to establish colonies on
earth thereby to effect an escape you know
how that idea led to the interplanetary war
twenty years ago of course their hopes
were dashed and they returned to their dy-
ing planet in despair

  what use the martian asks himself is the
effort to improve the individual and the race
there is so little future left to them he
therefore decided to live for present alone

  and to forget the future added brom-
burg

  right the wealth of mars is being spent
on sensations the scientists who are given
the greatest rewards are those who perfect
new pleasure devices the joy-lamp-you
saw it in action last night-will be only the
first step in amazing new dissipations and
so captain the people of mars must be saved
at once

  i understand said bromburg my ex-
pedition is to be an effort at finding a new
home for martians

  exactly the emergency is desperate we
know venus is a world of mists and bogs
mercury backed by the sun is worse off
than mars but the moons of jupiter are
more encouraging ganymede the third satel-
lite is nearly as large as mars has more air
and the telescopes show is well off in the
matters of oceans and continents the fourth
satellite is somewhat smaller but also ap-
pears habitable

  bromburg nodded its worth trying any-
how

   good lad cried stillwell

  he rose and took books and maps from a
set of shelves	

  i dont mean to send you into this thing
without telling you just what youre up
against he said turning pages here we
have a table showing the distance from
mars to jupiter at various oppositions the
shortest is more than three hundred million
miles or nearly nine times the distance from
mars to earth on the short passage of
course youre not the first man who has been
sent to jupiter ward moore commanded an
expedition so did robert mcclintock so
did jack copeland none of them ever came
back

  its worth trying repeated bromburg
doggedly

  stillwell now spread out a set of plans

  well be able to send you out with the
best equipment ever built he said if
copeland and those other poor devils could

have done it perhaps they would have cpme
through now this shows you the workings
of the nonpareil your ship for the job

  it seems a splendid craft said brom-
burg how long must it be in flight

  the most favorable journey should be-
gin next month replied stillwell duvel-
skoe who has been supervising a part of the
building figures eight months in space be-
tween mars and jupiter the ship is fitted
for twelve months flight only which means
that you must replenish your supply of rock-
et fuel from natural sources at the other end
as you see here is your equipment for
doing so he indicated a chamber at the
stem of the ship

rthe two plunged into an interested dis-

	cussion of the proposed attempt duvel-
skoe was sent for and hurried over to pre-
sent opinions and questions several mar-
tian officials happening in enthusiastically
greeted bromburg when introduced

  i am a thousand times encouraged at
meeting you said one taking the young
mans hand between his in the martian man-
ner of greeting how much you resemble
the original rolf bromburg by inheritance
you are a hero and a leader by training
you are an accomplished explorer of space
already i visualize you as the savior of my
people

  i will do my best said bromberg a bit
embarrassed by such warmth

  you must do your best and you shall suc-
ceed interposed another you cannot
must not fail

  at length the conference broke up the
martians remained to chat with stillwell
while bromburg and duvelskoe took their
departure as they walked down a corridor
toward the outer door a feminine voice
hailed them turning they saw thiana still-
well hastening toward them

  may i speak to you she asked brom-
burg duvelskoe nodded quickly and walked
on alone the other paused and waited for
what the girl might say

  she turned upon him a pair of eyes that
might quicken the coldest hearts on two
worlds

  captain bromburg i want to apologize
for what happened last night she said

  please dont trouble ive already for-
gotten it

  i want to be sure that it remains for-
gotten she went on i acted like a fool
and did my best to make you act like one

i didnt know at the time that you were the
captain bromburg for whom my father had
been waiting

  at these words a slight frown creased the
young mans brow i wish you hadnt said
that last he told her
the disc-men of jupiter	

  why she asked quickly

  because it shows that you arent apologiz-
ing to me at all you are apologizing to the
memory of my ancestor who lived nearly
eight hundred years ago

  her eyes snapped indeed she said net-
tled captain i feel that in apologizing at
all i have done quite enough it was my
fathers idea anyway i daresay he told you
to expect it

  you do your father wrong miss still-
well he said nothing whatever about you
and as i remarked a moment ago i had
forgotten about it but if you must speak to
me why refer me back to my ancient fore-
fathers

  im arguing not for myself but for the
original rolf bromburg he did what in his
day was considered a tremendous deed he
flew around a world in nineteen-thirty-sev-
en and landed to find himself a hero he
was bewildered by the applause he received
but turned his popularity to the end nearest
his heart-the advancement of aviation proj-
ects he hated sham and ostentation that
is why i dont want to profit in any way
whatsoever by the fact that i bear his name
if i allowed it his spirit would despise me
and i should hate myself

  thiana stillwell laughed shortly

  i love brave speeches captain that one
should be put in a television play so you
arent going to profit by his name eh what
beside his name got you the chance to con-
duct this expedition of yours and what
can your interest be except to do something
that you think will give the bromburg name
fresh lustre that long-ago flight around
the earth seems rather feeble to you now
doesnt it perhaps youll accomplish your
objective too i wonder what your descend-
ant eight hundred years from now will be
doing to surpass your heroics

 im growing more sorry every moment
that you tried to apologize said bromburg

  sorry nothing you glory in it go on
with your gallant adventure you brave man
two worlds will cheer you on your way but
i wont i will be sure that i never see you
again i hope that you-

  she paused suddenly her mouth half open
her eyes suddenly frightened at what she
was saying

  you were going to say suggested brom-
burg after a moment that you hoped i
would never return perhaps you feel that
i deserve not to but how about poor lieu-
tenant duvelskoe who has done you no
wrong

  she gasped in rage stamped her foot and
turning hurried away

  bromburg followed her with his eyes a
half-smile played about his lips then he
too turned and followed duvelskoe

 hi an a stillwell was as good as her

	word she was careful to keep out of
bromburgs way during the frequent visits
he made to her fathers home for the pur-
pose of perfecting plans for the expedition
for the rest neither of the two mentioned
the affair and nobody remarked anything
out of the way

  bromburg found the newly-built non-
pareil a thing of unceasing wonder and de-
light to his adventurous soul it was an
egg-shaped craft stoutly but gracefully
made pierced all around with wide ports
inside the upper and lower portions were
separated by a deck of transparent glass
only a small part of the space was avail-
able for living quarters the rest being filled
by the machinery and supplies needed for
the long voyage

  in the deck was located the electrical mech-
anism that established the ships center of
gravity so that a man might walk upright
in the top compartments while another in
the section beneath would appear with feet
opposed like a fly clinging upside down to
the bottom of an overturned glass this de-
vice was necessary in order to give the ship
an axis on which it might spin as it trav-
elled through emptiness

  the nonpareil was well equipped with
television apparatus and instruments for the
most complex astronomical observations but
the radio fixtures were limited the ex-
plorers venturing to a distance ten times
greater than the greatest space flight at-
tempted to date would be beyond the reach
of the most powerful sending set on either
earth or mars

  the fuel for the rocket engines that pro-
pelled the craft was a new and ultra-power-
ful development of liquid oxygen and liquid
hydrogen carefully blended there was also
equipment for manufacturing new fuel when
the supply ran low all other appointments
were of the most modern and most prac-
ticable sort

  bromburg and duvelskoe made several
test flights and were highly pleased with the
performance of their vehicle stillwell older
and more sober-minded though he was be-
came infected with their enthusiasm

  at least we are giving you the finest
space-ship in history for the flight he told
them and what is more two of the finest
young space-wranglers in history are going
to fly it

  duvelskoe grinned in pleasure at this
compliment from a man so highly placed
while bromburg flushing a little in confu-
sion turned to examine the nearest instru-
ment board

  after the test flights the nonpareil was
brought to a sheltered dock there to be giv-
en a final and thorough checking over the
startling stories

 

day of the start approached duvelskoe
ought off his growing nervousness with a
series of mild dissipations bromburg seemed
no more perturbed than a man of stone

  at last on a clear midnight the nonpareil
stood upon the metal runway of a rocket
port high on a rooftop of ekadome a score
of searchlights converged upon it from other
rooftops which were crowded with favored
spectators the microphoto machines of a
host of television stations were also trained
upon the scene through them the popula-
tions of two worlds were watching

  but a strong guard of martian police agents
kept the runway clear save for the two
young fliers and half a dozen others-offi-
cials scientists and jack stillwell

  goodby and good luck said the latter
wringing the hands of his two youthful
friends in a year and a half ill be look-
ing for you again

  keep dinner hot for us smiled duvel-
skoe

  my daughter spoke of coming to see you
went on stillwell

  is that so said bromburg looking up
with sudden interest
yes but i couldnt find her at home when
i came i left word with the guards to let
her come up she would be greatly thrilled
to tell you goodby personally

  it would be well not to delay the flight
much longer volunteered a martian as-
tronomical expert gazing upward just now
the ship will find it easiest to make a good
journey through the atmospheric envelope
an hour later and it will be much harder
to start auspiciously

  thats right said duvelskoe wed bet-
ter go eh chief he saluted his comrade
in friendly mockery

  yes wed better agreed bromburg he
shook hands with stillwell again goodby
sir convey our respects to your daughter
and tell her that we had to leave on the
minute and so could not wait for her

  he entered the lock at the side of the non-
pareil duvelskoe followed shutting the
panel behind him the others fell quickly
away from the runway a purring sound
arose and the craft began to tremble as the
rocket engines started their spinning a
sudden burst of flame and the big metal egg
slid forward-upward-away a mighty
cheer from thousands of human throats rose
to make the buildings vibrate and speed the
expedition on its way

in the control room of the nonpareil
 duvelskoe kept a close watch through
the forward ports while bromburg his eye
on the space-charts was striking out a series
of combinations on the control keyboard

  nose up a trifle rolf called duvelskoe

now straight ahead keeping low speed un-
til we clear the atmosphere he glanced to
his left  way over there i see jupiter
eight months from now hell be meeting us
up there in the sky

  beneath them the lights of ekadome were
steadily dwindling phobos one of mars two
tiny moons loomed on their starboard quar-
ter like a chinese lantern hung in the heav-
ens

  hows the air gauge by now queried
bromburg

  it shows thin but hold her speed steady
answered duvelskoe think of all the good
ships and wranglers that have been cooked
just on account of picking up too much fric-
tion on nice fresh air however am i telling
you youre the superior officer

  so say the flying orders said bromburg
maybe i ought to make you say captain
sir when you talk to me

  try and do it laughed duvelskoe
then if i dont slam me in irons and put
me under confinement while you stand my
watches and yours too he looked at the
air gauge were clearing the atmospheric
envelope now ill give you the word and
you give her the guns

  he held up a hand then brought it quick-
ly down all clear he shouted brom-
burgs hands as quick and skillful as a
pianists struck a new pattern on the key-
board the nonpareil quivered throughout
its whole construction as the rear rocket
tubes all went into action at once duvel-
skoe stepped quickly to a table and drew the
indicator of the automatic steering gear
down to touch a carefully marked point on
a map of the solar system

  all set he said relaxing now if we
were lazy enough or trustful enough we
could go into the feathers and sleep for the
next eight months waking up in time to see
jupiter peeping in through the window of
our bedroom

  suppose we did that and a meteor came
along and shot this ship right out from under
us suggested bromburg

  why then id flap my arms up and down
and yell tm a bird im a bird and you
could say i told you so to me

  that privilege would be something at
least said the young captain rumpling his
tawny hair well if youre really so tired
go take a nap and ill stand first watch
duvelskoe shook his head violently ill
do all my sleeping when im supposed to be
lookout he said just now im going to
go aft and see how mars looks falling off
our tail come along

  no thanks ill stay here and see that we
hold our course

  right said duvelskoe you want to
look ahead i want to look back maybe thats
the disc-men of jupiter	

why youre the captain and im the lieu-
tenant at least i cant think of any other
reasons

  he went back along the narrow corridor
toward the little observatory in the stern
bromburg remained in his seat by the key-
board he was thinking not of the expedi-
tion but of jack stillwells beautiful daugh-
ter

  and so she had meant to bid him goodby
after all-or had she perhaps she had sent
the message only to taunt him or planning
to come had changed her mind at the last
moment and stayed away

  or maybe she had indeed tried to reach
him but had been delayed in the close-
packed crowds and had arrived at the run-
way only to see his ship take flight had
he waited a few moments she might have
taken his hand and spoken kindly she
might have forgiven him for making her an-
gry and have asked forgiveness for her own
harsh words

  whatever she had meant or done he would
have liked one more sight of her lovely dark
face

  but these thoughts were banished as a
sound of commotion rase in the corridor
growing louder and louder he rose and
turned to see two figures emerge laugh-
ing and wagging his curly head duvelskoe
was dragging someone by the wrist

  stowaway captain make her scrub the
dock and clean cuspidors he cried out and
pushed his captive into the light

  it was thiana stillwell

chapter ih
bromburg commands

without rising from his seat brom-
burg stared at the two thiana drew
herself up patted down her clouds of jetty
hair and stared back with all the scornful
defiance she could command

  enter the third conspirator she said
her tone was bantering but she did not
smile

  bromburg did not move or speak he only
waited as if for further speech from her
thianas face betrayed a bit of confusion as
if she had been caught stealing cookies

  i told you that you wouldnt see me be-
fore you left she went on with a great
show of ease well i kept my word-i al-
ways do but i have been a little perplexed
i thought that you might believe i was afraid
of you that is why i slipped in to ride
with you a part of the way

  part of the way echoed duvelskoe

how do you expect to get back from here
youll take me of course replied thiana
coolly you wouldnt make me walk back
would you

  at this bromburg rose his gesture was
that of one who suddenly remembers his
manners with a lady in the room but on his
feet he towered impressively and seemed
anything but apologetic thiana wished that
he had remained seated and so allowed her
to keep the feeling that she commanded the
situation that feeling was growing fainter
and fainter

  am i to understand said the captain
that you stowed away in the belief that you
would be taken back to mars

   i did believe it she said and i shall
be taken back

  so you shall he made reply so you
shall when we have completed our mission
to the moons of jupiter

  thiana stiffened and paled at that and
duvelskoes grin grew fainter

   what the girl almost shouted

  we are on our way to a hitherto un-
explored part of the solar system said
bromburg we cannot turn back you are
here and you are going along

   the tone of his voice showed that he was
as resolute as rock the fight went out of
thiana in an instant her voice shook as
she spoke again

  but-but do you mean it

   mean it of course i mean it

  captain bromburg she pleaded what
a dreadful revenge to take on me

   its not revenge at all its necessity
necessity to take me into unknown dan-
gers unforeseen hardships really-

  when you spoke last you were prone to
minimize the dangers and the hardships and
to think more of the applause werent
you remember you said that i was after
glory well now you have your chance to
share in it

   but why surely it would be only a short
run back

  he picked up a handful of papers and
spread them out see here miss stillwell
here are the most delicate and careful cal-
culations  ever saw they represent the
work of a corps of the finest astronomers and
scientists on mars and on them we are
basing our speed our route the conduct of
our entire expedition

  to turn back now would necessitate a
complete revision it would take weeks and
in the meantime the favorable opposition of
mars and jupiter would be past i am sorry
miss stillwell truly sorry but i cant turn
back for your sake or for the sake of any
other person

   he turned away as if that settled it drop-
ping into his seat he gave his attention again
	startling stories

to the space-charts and control-board the
girl almost ran to him

  but im not prepared i brought along
no equipment

  well fit you out from among our things
  this amounts to kidnapping

  thats right put in duvelskoe give it
a think rolf her father is the one whos
eending us out he certainly didnt authorize
us to take his daughter along

  with all due respect to stillwell my
orders come straight from much higher
authorities said bromburg quietly

  lord duvelskoe persisted think what
a jam we may get into over this

  ive considered it and i think i am doing
my duty to the best of my ability

  your duty blazed duvelskoe is it
your duty to take out your spite on me as
well as on her listen now-

  that will do bromburg sprang to his
feet with one commanding gesture he si-
lenced his associate im captain here and
im the only law on board the nonpareil
we were joking about it a moment ago but
it no joke now if your questioning of my
authority is serious the sooner we settle it
the better do you want to fight me

  he clenched two brown sinewy fists

  no i dont said duvelskoe quickly
then stop trying to take this matter out
of my hands

  duvelskoe turned and walked away down
the corridor thiana followed him

  arent you going to help me she
queried anxiously

  duvelskoe turned his gypsy face toward
her the grin had returned to it

  im afraid not you heard what rolf
said and you heard what i said captain
rolf bromburg commands the good ship
nonpareil

  one of the two tiny sleeping compartments
was turned over to thiana while the men
agreed to share the other she was given a
pair of duvelskoes breeches some puttees
a sweater and a leather coat she uttered
casual words of thanks as though they were
making her comfortable on a picnic then
she closed the door of her compartment be-
hind her and remained unseen and silent

mours passed duvelskoe was sleeping
 and bromburg forward with the ma-
chinery was jotting down the first days
record in the brand new log book

  ships run for past twenty-four hours
one hundred thirty-four thousand and nine
miles he began under that he noted the
standings of various meters showing con-
sumption of rocket fuel gravitational pull of
the sun and the nearest planets and other
significant data

  the first days performance of the non-

pareil throughout all appointments left
nothing to be desired he went on its
mechanism cleared the martian atmospheric
envelope handily lieutenant duvelskoe set-
ting the automatic steering devices pro-
nounced them efficient to a hair

  his brow creased slightly as he set down
the next paragraph

  less than an hour after clearing from
atmosphere a stowaway was discovered on
board name miss thiana stillwell daugh-
ter of the trustee and chief advisor of the
expedition she asked to be returned to
mars immediately her request was refused
and the expedition continued on its mission
he closed the log-book and put it away
then from a small shelf he drew another
volume bound in red settling back in a
position from which he could command the
forward ports the television screens and all
control mechanism he began to read

  as he turned the pages he sensed a pres-
ence behind him looking around he saw
thiana stillwell dressed in the ill-fitting
clothes lent her and very attractive in spite
of them

  you are reading she said

  as you see he replied rising and offer-
ing her his seat
i havent read in ages she told him
accepting it however there wont be much
else to do will there

  not in the way of recreation im afraid
we have no television drama no motion pic-
tures no radio music duvelskoe brought
a guitar i think but thats all-that and a
deck of cards and a few books like this one
what is it

  its called lorna doone you may look
at it if you wish

  she thumbed through it its a love story
isnt it

  of a sort it has exciting moments too
raids fighting and mystery along toward
the last of the book one man rips out an-
others biceps with his bare hands

  oh it sounds like the savage ancients
it was written in the nineteenth cen-
tury thats eight hunched years ago

  i suppose they really acted that way
then i wonder what for sometimes

  in this case for lorna doone

  was lorna doone the girl in the book
she asked she must have been a dreadful
person to inspire such things

  bromburg laughed hardly wait ill
read to you about her

  he took the book and quickly found a
passage he read aloud

  by the side of the stream she was com-
ing to me even among the primroses as if
she loved them all and every flower looked
the brighter as if her eyes were on them

i could not see what her face was my heart
the disc-men of jupiter	

was awake and trembled only that her hair
was flowing from a wreath of white violets
and the grace of her coming was like the
appearance of the first wild-fiower the pale
gleam over the western cliffs threw a shad-
ow of light behind her as if the sun were
lingering never do i see that light from
the closing of the west even in these my
aged days without thinking of her ah me
if it comes to that what do i see of earth
or heaven without thinking of her

  when he was through thiana shook her
head slowly

  how beautiful that is no modern writer
can say it as well

  perhaps no modern woman can inspire
it said bromburg

  thats hardly complimentary

  im afraid its trde

  rising she looked at him with a softened
face

  i wonder if youll lend me the book when
youre done she said

hays lengthened into weeks the three
human beings in their cramped quar-
ters settled into an accustomed routine of
existence thiana read not only lorna
doone but all the books in bromburgs tiny
library and then searched eagerly for other
occupation

  duvelskoe lightened the tedium of the long
quiet hours he taught her to step off vio-
lent posturing dances which he said were
favorites of his gypsy ancestors then ac-
companied her on the guitar he wrestled
with bromburg accepting with rueful good
nature an almost unbroken series of de-
feats the three also played chess and cards
and found much to interest them in the
spectacle of the heavens around them

  in the spangled reaches of the stars mars
had dwindled to a small red spot far astern
jupiter grew larger afar to one side as he
hastened along the track which would bring
him to his far-off rendezvous with the non-
pareil the ship seemed utterly alone an
independent world in itself with which they
had become more familiar than the great
globe of soil and water that had given them
birth

  the situation would try the most resolute
patience sometimes and more than once
thiana would find cause for quarrel with
bromburg among other things she resented
the fact that he turned to duvelskoe and not
to her for lessons in the universal language
of mars

  im half martian she pointed out hes
a terrestrial like all his people before him
on both sides why not learn from me

  because duvelskoe has lived on mars
for several years while you for all your
descent have been reared and educated on

earth i can get a purer accent from his
teachings

  a purer accent she said her cheeks
growing hot you put quite a premium on
purity dont you captain

  a tremendous one he answered

  on my soul i think you dont want to
talk to me

sometimes i do not he told her frankly
she exclaimed in surprised anger and flung
out of his presence for several days she
avoided him as completely as the limited
space inside the ship would allow

  on the other hand she worked hard to
fill a place in the daily routine she under-
took to prepare the meals to keep the living
quarters clean and otherwise to free the men
from such tasks in order that they might
spend more time with the controls and in-
struments

  a month and a half in space saw them
with nearly a fourth of the distance behind
them thiana noticed that her companions
spent longer hours at the machinery and kept
a sharper lookout she wondered at this
but asked no questions

  at last one day as she stood musing be-
side a port she was attracted by a light
in outer space looking up in surprise she
beheld a great luminous disc three times the
size of the moon as seen from earth and
like the moon mottled and flecked as she
watched it grew larger and larger she
cried out in delight at its beauty and gazed
raptly as the speeding ship flashed across
in front of the wonder the shining body
dropped astern

  what was it she crifcd running forward
to where duvelskoe and bromburg were
at work together i was so sorry to leave
it behind

  if we hadnt left it behind it would have
smashed us to atoms said bromburg that
was an asteroid-one of the many little
planets that are found in this part of space
well see more of them i for one wish that
we would see less

  it was an asteroid that washed out jack
copeland when he tried to make a flight
to jupiter duvelskoe told her coneland
wasnt much of a space wrangler but he
had nerve and evidently he was all sorts of
a good fellow imagine his feelings when
that little world suddenly loomed up to
knock him off

  if its so dangerous why couldnt we fly
over the asteroid belt asked thiana

  that would be hard to do especially since
we want to hold to our course as laid
bromburg explained- but it isnt so dan-
gerous after all were equipded with radio
devices that warn us of approaching bodies
that is something that co-land and the
others never heard of well slip through
bo	startling stories

them just like a football player who changes
pace in order to avoid tacklers when they
rush him

  football player you say did you play
football

  a little in school

  a little cried duvelskoe grimacing
heavens young lady did you never follow
sports on earth six years ago rolf here was
the master mind and the master physique that
made oklahoma universitys eleven a bunch
of all-internationals his modesty and your
ignorance are giving me a brand new thrill

  six years ago was a little before my
time as a football fan she apologized

  then youre forgiven said duvelskoe

bromburg was not listening he was
intently watching a bowl-like instru-
ment connected by wires to a dial-covered
cabinet and about two thirds full of a gleam-
ing white liquid like mercury or molten sil-
ver even as he gazed the surface of the
liquid became agitated and emitted blue
sparks

  another asteroid already he glanced
at the dials its a long way off however
spot it on the television will you duvel-
skoe

  the lieutenant did so were out of dan-
ger from it if we keep this speed rolf he
said its not within hours of us and there
are no others in sight

  he found time to lecture thiana on the
nature and origin of the asteroids he told
how in all probability a great planet had
once skimmed around the sun in these lati-
tudes of space only to break into bits
through some gigantic catastrophe the
asteroid belt was many millions of miles
across but they hoped to encounter very
few of the spinning particles at this time

  days followed with the ship now slowing
now speeding to get out of the orbits of
approaching asteroids it passed close behind
ceres the largest of the group and all looked
in wonder at the miniature world  miles
in diameter with its miniature mountains
valleys and craters

  do you suppose anyone ever lived there
inquired thiana

  im afraid not answered duvelskoe
ceres is far too small to have ever had
air or water people living on her would
have to build artificial cities with synthetic
atmosphere held under domed roofs like the
colonies on the moons of earth and mars

  the force of gravity would be very low
on that little planet yonder said bromburg
who had been busy taking photographs
you could throw a thousand pound weight
around like a pebble you could jump nearly
a mile straight up if you had any athletic
prowess at all and the three of us could

life this space-ship above our heads with our
unaided muscular strength

  that would be very exciting said thi-
ana will we find the same conditions on
jupiter

  oh no gravity there is nearly two and
a quarter times what it is on earth you
weigh about one hundred twenty pounds on
earth-that would make you close onto two
hundred seventy on jupiter

  heavens cried thiana then lets stay
here on ceres

  another month elapsed bromburg and
duvelskoe did not relax their vigilance
they passed dozens of asteroids at close
quarters but never close enough to feel
gravely threatened rapidly they approached
the point where they kaew the danger of a
mid-space collision would be over

  but one day thiana came to die control-
room to find the two men working hard at
a system of levels their faces were set in
expressions of utmost seriousness

  whats the matter she asked

  fuel mixture went bad on us replied
bromburg shortly we have to change the
whole works right here and now

  and right on the edge of the asteroid
belt groaned duvelskoe bending over his
task thank heaven we have a few good
rocket tubes going they hold us on our
course but what if we want to change it
suddenly

  anything i can do offered thiana
nothing except stay out of our way
mumbled bromburg

  once more she felt her temper rise but as
she turned to walk away she saw something
that drove all feeling of personal injury from
her mind in the bowl-like instrument that
gave warning of approaching asteroids the
mercury-seeming liquid was stirring and
sparks rose and fell

  look she cried pointing both men
lifted their heads and saw

  of all the breaks exclaimed duvelskoe
running to check the television good
heavens theyre right on top of us
they echoed bromburg and he and
thiana also looked

  there nearly filling the whole of the re-
flecting screen were two hurtling images-
great shining irregular bodies spinning and
rotating at great speed each circling the
other even as die three looked the images
grew larger

  were lost cried thiana rushing to a
port sure enough the two asteroids loomed
upon and over them like dancing mountains
compared to their vast circles the nonpareil
suddenly seemed to dwindle in size until it
was like a grain of barley between these
mighty millstones of space

  lost i guess youre right said duvel-
the disc-men of jupiter	

skoe in a strangely calm voice theyre
only a few miles away might as well be a
few feet

  not lost yet flashed back bromburg
springing from the levers to the keyboard-
we have a chance

  a chinamans chance snorted duvel-
skoe but he looked hopefully at the tall
captain

  his eyes on the television bromburg be-
gan to pick at the keyboard as rapidly as
though it were a typewriter he struck com-
bination after combination slowing or speed-
ing the ship each moment

  are they here yet he queried

  here-yes shouted duvelskoe its cur-
tains

  bromburgs spread hands fell on the keys
once more the ship seemed to quiver like
a taut harp string

  in front of the bow whirled one asteroid
behind the stern whirled another for a
moment they seemed almost to scrape the
two ends of the hull then they fell away
began to recede they shrank in apparent
size before the fixed gaze of the watchers

  by moving between the two the nonpareil
had saved itself

  again bromburg clicked on the combina-
tion for full speed ahead and rose from his
seat even as he looked toward his com-
panions thiana slumped to the glass deck
and lay still

  he quickly knelt and raised her head

  bring water duvelskoe he called then
louder duvelskoe

  but the lieutenant still stood at the port
as motionless as though carved out of wood
watching the death that had slid past by
such a narrow margin and bromburg
called again before duvelskoe showed that
he had heard or seen what was happening
in the room beside him

chapter iv
ganyviede

slowly as if wearied by eight unbroken
months in space the nonpareil settled
down upon a gently rolling plain while
three faces appeared at the ports to look out
at the strange landscape

  around them lay stretches of mossy turf
that gleamed now violet now green like
changeable silk here and there it was
tufted with clumps of strange bushes in the
middle distance a silvery stream wound its
way and farther on were wooded hills in
the blue sky above drifted fleecy clouds and
two lights gleamed-the great banded globe

of jupiter and the smaller but much more
brilliant sun the expedition had reached
ganymede third moon of the jovian group

  delightful exclaimed thiana lets get
out into the open

  wait said bromburg

  wait she said sharply for her nerves
had been on edge for many monotonous
weeks are you so in love with this cramped
little nutshell well im not im sick of it

  im as anxious to get out as you are
went on bromburg but first we want to
know if its safe on ganymede why the
very air may choke you

  duvelskoe was bending over some testing
apparatus at the last remark of the captain
he looked up and shook his head

  fortunately not rolf as i analyze the
atmosphere it contains oxygen nitrogen
carbon dioxide and water vapoi-s just like
that of mars or earth its perfectly safe

  good said bromburg and the pres-
sure

  nearly thirteen pounds to the square
inch

  good said bromburg again that makes
breathing possible now thiana we may
leave

  one by one they passed through a lock
panel and for the first time in ages it
seemed felt turf and soil under their feet
bromburg stooped and took a pinch of earth

  it seems rich enough he reported lets
take some samples back duvelskoe also
some of this ganymedean grass he picked
some of the fine blades bruised them be-
tween his hands smelled them cautiously
tasted them

  going in for farming rolf joked duvel-
skoe

  not i but the colonists who come here
will at first glance it bests any agricultural
potentialities that mars may offer

  thiana was still pouting and her temper
was not improved when she saw that the
men did not notice her looks of disfavor
they were busily engaged in making gravity
tests in peering at the clouds through spec-
troscopes and in computing the light and
heal supply emanating from jupiter and the
sun also they found more and more speci-
mens and carried them to the ship at last
her ill-humor wore away and her heart
lightened as bromburg suggested a short
stroll to the banks of the stream

  the trio set out finding and discussing new
wonders at every step from the bushes
they gathered fleshy leaves and particolored
flowers of great size the stir of small life
was all about them once a rose-colored
creature the size of a squirrel and walking
upon many legs scuttled away from under
their very feet and darted into a hole

  they approached a bush-clump to see a
startling stories



larger thing peering interestedly at them
from the branches to which it clung but it
withdrew to some hiding place before they
could get a good glimpse of it overhead
they saw floating specks that might be large
birds nowhere however did they see culti-
vation or other sign of human works

  no natives hostile or otherwise ob-
served duvelskoe

  right so far as i can see agreed brom-
burg thats just as well for the colonists
will find the going much easier

  theyll be glad to find no home talent
to stage demonstrations against undesirable
foreigners contributed thiana

  they reached the water at last duvelskoe
made simple chemical tests and pronounced
it pure and drinkable

  this is really a wonderful real estate
bargain he exulted what could be a better
spot for the first colony than this little
subdivision good water rich soil no nasty
neighbors im tempted to settle down here
myself

  not while im captain you wont smiled
bromburg ill need you to help me wrangle
the nonpareil back to mars

  they returned to the ship and the next
several days were spent in making brief hops
here and there about the little world once
they paused on the shore of an ocean and
gathered strange shellfish for their collection
of specimens another time they perched
high on a mountain top while bromburg and
duvelskoe poked into what looked like metal
deposits at last they returned to the very
spot where they first landed

  night had fallen and they made a bonfire
duvelskoe played his guitar and sang and
thiana danced the gypsy steps she had
learned from him their canned and con-
centrated provisions were augmented by
fresh fruits and berries which analysis had
proved edible they felt more like picnick-
ers on a holiday than explorers on a strange
unknown globe

at the end of dinner bromburg checked
over a series of sheets and brought the
log up to date by firelight

  did you go over the ship today as i told
you he asked duvelskoe

  i did

  very well we will leave ganymede in
the morning

  homeward bound cried thiana

  not yet were going to circumnavigate
jupiter first which will take as i figure it
about twenty-eight days well make a lei-
surely survey finishing the job just at the
right time to start back

  twenty-eight days she ejaculated
nearly a month do you mean that youre
going to exile us from home still longer

  please thiana i wish you wouldnt put
it like that this is a scientific expedition
faugh what do i care for cold science
im interested in my own welfare just now
 thats very unfortunate bromburgs
voice had grown chilly you invited your-
self to go along with us you know and you
cant complain because the policy of this
expedition is not concerned primarily with
the welfare of those who make it up

  duvelskoe and i were provided with the
best ship the best instruments and equip-
ment ever seen but that was to make our
return as sure as possible were no more
than scientific instruments ourselves and
i will say again that i am in command the
ship and those upon it will operate under
my orders

  thiana rose without replying and entered
the nonpareil where it stood nearby

  duvelskoe looked closely at bromburg and
thought that he detected an expression of
unhappiness but perhaps it was the flicker-
ing of the firelight on the thoughtful face
for the young captain neither spoke nor
stirred nor so much as looked after thiana
duvelskoe tossed the stump of his cigarette
into the coals and broke the silence

  wed better be getting inside rolf
right said the other and rising
scratched dirt over the dying flames then
he led the way to the lock panel

  they entered and carefully shut them-
selves in at that moment there was a vibra-
tion in the floor under their feet even as
they paused in wonder the nonpareil rose
swiftly from its resting place and soared
heavenward

  bromburg and duvelskoe exchanged as-
tounded glances then they ran along the
narrow middle passageway toward the con-
trol rooms forward a glass door brought
them to a halt and refused to open when
they tried it they stood helplessly look-
ing into the compartment beyond where
thiana labored unskilfully but to some pur-
pose at the keyboard

  bromburg rapped loudly on the glass
turning thiana made a mocking gesture

  let us in cried the captain let us in

i say youll kill us all

  not on your life im having the first good
time ive had since i left mars the girl
called back her voice made audible by the
radio attachments with which every part
of the ship was fitted and i wont kill you
all im flying splendidly

  i told you to evacuate the fuel supply
last night bromburg said to duvelskoe
you did it i suppose

  i did replied the other

  do you hear that said bromburg
addressing thiana again we discharged all
the rocket fuel from the tanks making ready
the disc-men of jlpiter	

io generate new from the air and water
supply on ganymede youre travelling now
on the last few puffs that were left for
heavens sake bring her down before she
crashes

  thats a likely story she answered and
it might scare me if you had been more
convincing just now it sounds like a good
argument made up on the spur of the mo-
ment anyway im going to fly clear away
from ganymede and we wont crash any-
where

  shes utterly mad groaned bromburg
whatll we do

  stay here and keep her attention di-
verted whispered duvelskoe ill slip
down under and see if i cant come through
the hatchway into the control room ten
to one she hasnt thought to fasten it

  he turned and ran back down the passage

	n the stern observatory he knelt and

	threw back a metal cover revealing a
circular opening like a manhole into this
he fairly hurled himself head first in an-
other second he found himself scrambling
onto the opposite surface of the deck the
change in gravitational pull forcing him to
pull himself apparently upward and out of
the hole to do so he stood up his position
exactly the reverse of what it had been a
moment ago

  swiftly but slowly he ran forward again
looking downward he saw the soles of
bromburgs feet through the transparent
deck a moment later he was opposite the
control room was struggling through the
hatchway into it
but thiana saw him and ran toward him
she struck with a wrench duvelskoe sank
down half in half out of the opening she
dragged him through fastened the cover
securely and returned to the keyboard

  ill never forgive you for that shouted
bromburg startled out of his characteristic
tranquility at last

  im not asking your forgiveness captain
bromburg snapped thiana i have a num-
ber of your actions to forgive too

  straining his eyes to look at the instru-
ments near her bromburg could see that
the ship had cleared the atmospheric en-
velope of ganymede he could not fight back
the chill that came over him for he had
spoken the truth when he had said that only
a little fuel remained he was as close to
fear as he had ever been in his life

  but he told himself that he would stand
no more looking into that room like a dog
that has been kicked out he had pleaded
he had reasoned with this madwoman he
turned on his heel and walked back to the
stern ports where he looked moodily out
at the diminishing ball that was ganymede

  for minutes perhaps for half an hour
he stood thus he made no sound or mo-
tion suddenly the ship seemed to shake
itself he staggered to keep his balance
while before his eyes ganymede seemed to
spin away toward the side of the port and
out of his vision

  the fuel was gone the nonpareil was
falling back toward the satellite it had just
left

  quickly he raced forward again the door
into the control room was flung open before
him and thiana met him her face drawn
into a terrorized mask

  what have i done she quavered with-
out answering he dropped into the seat of
the keyboard and touched the top row of
keys

  he felt a little start of relief when he
found that in one tank remained some of the
low-grade fuel used for travelling at re-
duced speeds within atmospheric limits it
offered a slim chance but still a chance he
began striking combinations

  can you save us breathed thiana

  perhaps he said shordy his eyes went
first to the dull glow that ganymede made
on one flank then to the larger mass of
jupiter on the other his lips tightened and
his eyes reflected a sudden glint of deter-
mination he swung the nose of the non-
pareil away from ganymede again laying it
point-blank toward the huge planet

  then you think- began thiana

  please dont bother me he interrupted
she turned from him but without the feeling
of defiance that had always arisen within her
at his other fancied rebuffs she was weeping
now her eyes fell upon duvelskoe still
unconscious and she hurried to him at-
tempting to lift him

  now she realized that she had been crazy
for a little while had truly been a candi-
date for an asylum maddened by brom-
burgs assumption of command and responsi-
bility through all the epdless days the
eternal months she had made a ridiculous
move at last she was sane again but the
return of sanity did not banish the danger
into which her folly had put her and the
two men

  she stole a glance at bromburg who was
carefully striking at the single row of keys
to which the ship responded he was as cool
as skilful as ever if mortal man could save
them bromburg could she knew that

  she washed duvelskoes face with a damp
cloth he stirred under her ministrations
opened his eyes then rose quickly to his feet
seeing bromburg at the keyboard he
grinned his relief

  all right is she he asked

  all right as far as we have gone said
	startling stories

bromburg look at the gravity gauges will
you

  duvelskoe obeyed ganymede attracts us
about sixty-nine hundredths jupiter about
thirty hundredths and a little over other
bodies less than one percent

  continue to read me the figures regard-
ing jupiter alone every half minute said
bromburg

  what are you doing ventured thiana
are you heading for jupiter why that
will be as bad as falling back to ganymede
not quite said duvelskoe ganymede
is made up of hard rocks and soil the non-
pareil would be splattered like a ripe melon
but jupiter is gaseous-at least there is a
layer of gas thousands of miles thick on the
outside of the planet that is what gives us
a chance jupiters pull now about thirty
hundredths and a half

still the nonpareil moved forward at a
pace that seemed little better than creep-
ing while slowly by tiny divisions of a per-
cent jupiters attraction grew at last the
figure approached the fifty hundredth mark

  tell me when it reaches fifty hundredth
said bromburg bending to turn half a dozen
spigot-like instruments on a low stand be-
side the keyboard

  fifty even sang out duvelskoe a few
moments later immediately bromburg
struck half a dozen keys at once held them
for a second then rose from his seat

  ive done what i could he said let us
hope that its enough

  what did you do asked duvelskoe
poured all the fuel into the rear tube-
feeders when we came to the fifty hun-
dredth mark i fired it all every bit it wasnt
much-hardly more than a double shot-but
it should give us the momentum we need to
bring us right to jupiter if i had done
otherwise we might have begun to revolve
around the planet as one more tiny satellite
why not that way as well as another
suggested thiana

  because im hoping to find elements in
jupiters atmosphere from which we can
replenish our fuel supply doesnt that pos-
sibility interest you

  overwrought thiana began to weep again
but dried her tears when duvelskoe showed
her the wonder of jupiters steadily growing
globe

  far closer than any human eye ever had
before they observed the huge disc with its
cloudy stripes around its equator was a
broad belt a gleaming ivory white in color
and bounded above and below by narrower
belts of rusty red other stripes growing
narrower as they neared the poles showed
deep yellow tan reddish brownish and pur-
ple shades the poles themselves seemed to

be of a shadowy gray close examination of
the surface showed that it slowly seethed

  for an hour they watched the planets
apparent size increase with growing rapidity
they were falling faster and faster toward
it ganymede in the rear was only a moon-
like circle jupiter grew to fill the entire
range of their forward vision a vast parti-
colored cloud

  it wont be long now said duvelskoe
even as he spoke the formless surface
rushed toward them enveloped them the
nonpareil had plunged into jupiters mass

  on on they went with misty wreaths
swishing past the ports so swift was their
pace that friction with the gases outside
geeniated an uncomfortable heat had their
ship been less cunningly made and of less
durable material it might have caught fire
but it retained its shape and substance while
its speed grew less by degrees and at last
slowed to a halt

  examination proved that they were float-
ing idly in the midst of butter-colored clouds
as a sunken wreck floats in the middle depths
of a sea from below came a steady stream
of light struggling to pierce the vapors but
what its source might be they could not see
no motion could be observed save in the
ship itself

chapter v
disc-men

bhe three occupants of the nonpareil

	were affected in widely different ways
by the aspect of their new surroundings
thiana could only stand and stare in amaze-
ment bromburg was at the television try-
ing to get a clearer view of the source of the
light from below duvelskoe looked up from
his work with an exclamation of joy

  this stuff has what it takes to run us
back home he cried ive found both oxy-
gen and hydrogen

  is it anything that we can breathe
asked bromburg td like to get out into
it if so

  dont try it in the first place the pres-
sure is considerable and the density is
greater than that of the most thoroughly
water-saturated air then there is a whole
chemistry shop full of other elements in
with the oxygen and hydrogen even includ-
ing some metallic vapors youd need a
space suit to make any kind of a successful
trip outdoors

  the buoyancy apparatus of the ship is
holding us at this level said bromburg i
wish we could drop lower id like to know
the disc-men of jupiter	

more about whatever it is that is sending
up the light i suppose that there is an
incandescent liquid core in the center of the
planet just as the theorists say but i want
to be sure

  heavens man leave something for the
next expedition to find out laughed duvel-
skoe in the meantime lets set our mixing
machinery to work

  the two men began operating the ma-
chinery in the fuel hold and soon found that
it successfully separated and prepared the
oxygen and hydrogen needed to feed their
rocket blasts inside of thirteen hours they
estimated they would be equipped for the
journey back leaving the mechanism in
motion they returned to thiana who was
standing with her face close to the largest
port as they approached she beckoned to
them with excited gestures

  come quickly she cried heres some-
thing absolutely unbelievable

  they hurried to her side and looked out
through the smoky yellow veil they made
out a strange moving thing that they
peered revealed itself as a dark di e its
edge inclined toward them slowly turning
it was as large around as a tea-tray and
was thickest in the middle so that its shape
was like that of two saucers placed with
concave faces together its spinning motion
increased and it drew nearer they could
see now that it was composed of living tis-
sue

  closer it came and closer it spun out of
sight to the left coming up against the ship
and a moment later came into view again
but a few inches from the port there it
hovered almost within arm s length of them
while they stood silent fearing that a sound
or a motion might cause it to go away

  slowly it revolved and nowhere upon it
could they see the slightest trace of a visible
organ yet it quite patently sensed their
presence their attitude as it hovered there
after a little time it suddenly went spin-
ning away again to be swallowed by the
enveloping vapors

  it was alive wasnt it murmured thi-
ana gazing after the vanishing discoid

  indeed it was replied duvelskoe alive
and intelligent

  i wonder what its principle of movement
can be said bromburg it had absolutely
no legs wings fins or other organs of loco-
motion as we know them yet it travelled
easily and swiftly in all directions

  and it didnt have eyes or ears either
added duvelskoe yet it knew we were
here and ran away probably to tell mother
id like to capture it mused the cap-
tain we could learn a lot from it-perhaps
new methods of flight-

  i vote we leave that to another expedi-

tion too interrupted duvelskoe that is
if there ever is another expedition at pres-
ent im interested chiefly in getting out of
here the climate seems so unhealthy-all
foggy and misty with the sunlight down un-
derfoot instead of overhead

   suppose we eat suggested thiana

  right it must be neaireakfast time
said bromburg he turned away from the
port but halted at duvelskoes cry and
looked out again

  spinning into view came a host of disc-
creatures as far as he could see through
the mists they were swarming from all di-
rections and he felt sure that there were
countless others out of sight in the clouds
like a plague of gnats they drew in around
the nonpareil brushing its sides pausing at
its ports cruising along its length

   say our little friend has brought all his
brothers and sisters to take a look at us
said duvelskoe

   the spinning creatures ranged in size from
soup-plate to cartwheel and in color from
soft tan to deep purplish brown all were in
motion whether merely bobbing up and
down as if floating on a quiet stream or
skimming and whirling here and there like
leaves in a high wind yet none of them
left the vicinity of the ship

juddenly a larger disc floated into view
 -one as large as a round table-top and
almost black in hue it went straight from
bow to stern of the nonpareil as if mak-
ing an inspection then it drew away the
smaller discs fell back too ranging them-
selves in a sort of curtain formation beyond
the big one

   theyre falling away on this side too
said duvelskoe running across to look out
of the ports opposite that big fellow is
a commander of some sort i wonder what
theyre up to now

   he had only an instant of mystification
from the disc-commanders center suddenly
shot a long fine tendril shooting upward
and upward extending itself like a serpen-
tine ribbon thrown into the air at a carnival
as if it were a signal every other disc hurled
forth a similar thread toward the ship a
thousand slender lines touched the metal
hull at the same instant then as if alive
they glided away under or around it in
a quarter of a minute the nonpareil was
completely encompassed by the slim cords

  then the discs began to move to and fro
and up and down like shuttles on a com-
plicated loom the lines by which they held
the ship became crossed and interwoven
until the whole was a sort of coarse fabric
in which the craft was completely netted
like a fruit in a string bag good lord
theyve captured us gasped duvelskoe
	startling stories

  any fuel in the tanks asked bromburg

  there must be a little by now shall we
try to break loose

 yes no telling what they mean to do
to us

  the captain crossed to the keyboard and
struck a combination the ship moved for-
ward then stopped the network held

  no use groaned duvelskoe if we hit
that little gunnysack at full speed wed
smash it to pieces like a paper hoop but
we cant get up enough power from a stand-
still

  he was right bromburg tried other com-
binations but his efforts were useless the
ship was bound on every quarter

 for a moment all three human beings
gazed helplessly at each other then brom-
burg made one more attempt he went to
the port nearest the big disc-thing that
seemed to be in command and pressed his
hands and face close to the pane the
strange creature drew near

  first bromburg pointed to himself then
showed his hands open and empty to de-
note peaceful intentions he waved his arms
in a gesture to include the ship then pointed
to the threadlike lines that criss-crossed the
port then he made sweeping movements
of his hands to indicate loosening of the
bonds and pointed again to himself his com-
rades then upward in an effort to show that
he wished to do nothing but go away

  the big disc seemed to quiver with each
new sign he made

  i think that it understands he said
softly he finished his pantomine by holding
out both hands in appeal

  the creature hovered for a moment only
then it spun slowly away bromburg looked
back at duvelskoe and thiana

  it knew what i meant he said it knew
-and it refused

 i wish i had a ray-gun gritted out
duvelskoe shaking his fist at the uncanny
things outside how id wash out these
animated dinner-plates id show them what
to hold and what to turn loose

  yes we should have been provided with
space-weapons said bromburg however
we arent we have only the smallest of
disintegrator rays fit for a hand weapon
but no more if there was ground outside on
which we could stand we might slip out
and fight as it is they would probably
whip their threads around us and drag us
off the outside of the ship

  what are those threads of theirs asked
thiana

  as far as i can see they are simply spun
out like the web of a spider said brom-
burg thats a good comparison just now
for if we arent caught like a moth in a
web im no judge

  thiana dropped her head

  i feel dreadfully guilty she said ive
been such a fool i was downright wicked
and now im being punished for it but you
two are being punished with me that is
the hardest to stand

  for a moment she seemed almost ready to
burst into tears bromburg stepped quickly
to her side and took her hand

  dont say that he pleaded you guessed
wrong and here we are but blaming you
wont get us out of this pinch forget any
troubles we may have had

  she looked up at him and for the first
time they smiled into each others eyes
thiana dashed away a few tears

  im not going to pout over my misfor-
tunes any more she promised im going
to puzzle out a way to get us away from
here

  they might have said more but at that
moment they felt the ship moving looking
out they saw the yellow mist drifting past
and knew that their discoid captors were
dragging the nonpareil along by countless
lines from the bow ports they could see
the unattached commander leading the way
whatever their fate was to be they were
approaching it

	bow far the nonpareil was dragged by
 its strange captors could not be ascer-
tained there was no landscape outside
whereby one could judge speed and the
speedometers recorded nothing fast or
slowly the army of disc traveled for hours
while the three prisoners inside pondered
the question of escape but to no avail

  duvelskoe reported that the fuel tanks
were rapidly filling but this would help them
little while they were still in the net woven
by the disc-oreatures even had they been
able to attack they could hardly venture
forth into the bottomless mist to do so on
and on their ship was dragged always with
the same weird company in attendance the
same yellow fog enveloping it the same
glowing light beneath

 how do we end up wondered thiana

  hard to tell said bromburg we cant
do anything to them and as far as we know
they cant do anything to us unless we open
the lock panels and let them in it looks
as if it will be a siege we can live for
months and months yet shut in as we are

  im against that said duvelskoe lets
open up and dare some of them in id
rather die with my teeth in a throat grant-
ing that these things have throats

  we wont open up until i order it re-
joined bromburg there may be a way out
yet for instance if only they werent watch-
ing us on all sides someboriv could slip out
in a space-suit with the disintegrator then
the disc-men of jupiter	

it would be a simple job to cut away all
those threads and we could get out of here
still the ship was dragged along the
three inside took turns at sleeping for they
were genuinely tired at last bromburg at
the forward port called his companions to
him

  theres the end of our journey or im
mistaken he said pointing to a great dark
patch ahead the disc-creatures pulled them
closer they came upon and above a sur-
face that seemed to be of tangible substance
looking down upon it they exclaimed in
amazement

  it was a disc-creature unthinkably large
its great irregular circle was as broad as
a landing field and the jet-black surface
pulsed and throbbed with life as their cap-
tors pulled the nonpareil toward it they saw
here and there shining spots like outcrop-
pings of glassy quartz upon a bank of earth
around the edges of the great body moved
groups of smaller discs as they watched
the explorers saw that these issued from
the big disc itself

  either they break away like buds or else
they live in cavities in that giant pancake
said duvelskoe i wonder which

  his question was answered a moment
later when the creatures that held the ship
dropped upon the black bosom of their huge
counterpart before the surprised eyes of
the watchers they seemed to plunge into
the substance lose themselves in it within
less than a minute they had completely
merged leaving the captive vessel bound to
the gigantic bulk by the many woven cords

  why theyre all part of the same crea-
ture said bromburg theyve gone back
into it now and those yonder are just so
many fragments breaking loose this is
unthinkable-scientists wont believe it
duvelskoe was peering through a peri-
scope that gave a view beneath the keel of
the nonpareil

  i doubt very much if the scientists will
have a chance to consider its possibility he
said have a look at this

  the periscope revealed one of the shining
spots directly beneath them on all sides
of it the confining cords were made fast
to the strange monster as the human cap-
tives watched the quartz-like glitter became
a warmer brighter gleam it grew larger
and more intense until a ray rose from it
toward the hull of the ship

  thats a natural lens said bromburg
its focussing light from beyond-probably
it extends clear through the discs substance
and is gathering the rays of the incandescent
body at the center of jupiter

  but whats it trying to do put in
thiana

  thats plain enough answered duvel-

skoe it wants to burn a hole in us then
send in a few pieces of itself to see whats
what oh it knows that there is meat in
the nut all right look theres the raiding
party now

 jtjre enough a score or more of disc-
  creatures the size of cartwheels and
 larger were gathering below the ship

  itll take some time to bum a hole big
 enough for those said duvelskoe the
 old nonpareil is as well made as they come
 but sooner or later our friend with the
 burning glass will succeed in its mission
 he and bromburg went through the hatch-
 way end and with their field of gravity re-
 versed climbed to the spot where the ray
 was striking already the metal of the hull
 was getting hot they returned to the con-
 trol room deeply concerned

  again i say let them in urged duvel-
 skoe let them in or let me out if i have
 to fight with things like that i want to do
 it down there where i can dance a gypsy
 clog on the big boys belly what do you
 say rolf lets carve our names on them
 for the next expedition to read

  not yet said bromburg id rather get
 away from here alive

   but how

  if ever we had the chance its now all
 those disc-things are down below one of
 us can get up above with the disintegrator
 and chop us a way out of the network be-
 fore they catch on itll have to be done
 quickly though

  then lets do it said duvelskoe run-
 ning to a locker help me into a space-
 suit-ill need it out in that poison fog

  he dragged out the clumsy-looking gar-
 ment of metal-strengthened fabric and be-
 gan to get into it

  wait ordered bromburg it was my
idea and im captain its my place to make
the venture

  your place nothing your place is in
 here at the controls we cant get away
 otherwise

  and your place is at the lookout
 thunder thats so said the lieutenant
 both our places are here whatll we do
 thiana will have to take the place of one
 of us offered bromburg

  thiana shook her head i cant do that
 she said i think ive demonstrated how
 little i know about running this ship
 then theres nothing to be done said
 duvelskoe a hopeless note creeping into his
 voice at last

  only one thing amended thiana one
 thing can save us bromburg must stay at
 the controls duvelskoe must keep lookout
 that leaves me to do the work outside

  both men stared at her both opened their
	startling stories

 muuths to speak but she cut them off

  youre going to say that it isnt my place
well it seems to be nobodys place at all
youll tell me that its dangerous so is stay-
ing here with that thing turning its way
into us and youll argue that im too weak
but ill show you help me into that space-
suit

  shes right rolf and she means busi-
ness said duvelskoe he held the suit for
her and she began to pull it onto her legs
body and arms

  well its a chance admitted bromburg
as if talking to himself he took the glass-
fronted space helmet and adjusted it on
thianas head

  she looked out at him with smiling eyes
her gloved hand clumsy in its metal fittings
clasped his for a moment then she turned
took the ray projector duvelskoe held out
to her and mounted the ladder toward the
lock panel above

chapter vi
escape

thianas first sensation as she emerged

	on top of the hull was a terrifying
heaviness

  she knew of course that this was due to
her leaving the insulated interior of the
nonpareil and coming into the open where
jupiter attracted all bodies with a strength
more than twice that of earth she told her-
self as much trying to quiet her fears but
she could not escape from the uncanny feel-
ing of that added weight which seemed in-
tent on dragging her down and keeping her
from the thing she had to do

  her next sensation was that of heat mak-
ing itself felt through the sturdy fabric
of her space-suit and her third was that
she was tied to the metal cleats to which she
clung just outside the lock-panel the web
of the disc-crcatures lay upon her preventing
her from rising she could only crawl and
that only with difficulty

  she turned on the mechanism of her ray
and leveled it at the uneven network before
her face with deep satisfaction she saw the
slender threads melt rapidly away she
quickly made a hole large enough to allow
her to rise it taxed her strength to attempt
the later move and it took all the strength of
her hands to force her body into an upright
position

  the space-suit designed for use on the
outside of just such hulls as these was
furnished with boots that had magnetic soles
and thiana was thankful for the firm foot-

ing they afforded her slowly she walked
toward the nose of the ship her ray ready
in her hands

  but suddenly she was conscious of shad-
ows in the murk around her looking to
right and left she saw great flocks of disc-
creatures rising along the sides of the ship
even as she looked each creature sprouted
a tendril toward her a dozen of them
strong as steel wires touched and encircled
her

  some instinct prompted her to drop down
on all fours still clutching her ray-gun with
one hand she grabbed a cleat with the other
and hooked both toes into the mass of
threads that swathed the ship as she did
so she felt a terrific pull exerted upon her
had she remained standing she would sure-
ly have been carried away by the attacking
disc

  thiana raised herself on the elbow of the
arm that held the cleat and with her other
hand turned on her ray again quickly but
accurately she swept its gleaming finger up-
ward

  the destroying light touched one then
another then a close-set group of discs
they seemed to explode before it and great
clouds of lead-folored vapor spread where
they had been swinging her ray horizon-
tally she cut herself free from the clutching
tendrils as if with a revolting blade while
the surviving assailants seemed to hesitate
before this sudden destruction she pushed
herself onto her feet again and ran forward
as fast as her failing strength could carry
her

  a big disc flew into her face like a bat
she flung up an arm to strike it away her
hand encountered something that felt like a
mass of pudding and the thing broke to
pieces as she hurled it aside with all her
might

  a moment later she was standing at the
very nose of the nonpareil

  her ray bit into the strands that bound it
she saw them fall away or flash into noth-
ingness altogether the hull stirred under
her feet now was slipping out of the hole
she was cutting for it again she felt lines
flinging themselves about her waist legs
and arms was almost torn from her stance
she threw herself onto her back flashed
her ray upward and laughed hysterically in-
side her helmet as she saw the round black
spots that were her enemies break into
clouds of disintegrated matter

  she lay tangled in the matted threads and
felt the ship siioping from underneath her
she hurried forward on hands and knees
clutched a cleat thrust her arm under it to
the elbow almost simultaneously the non-
pareil nosed upward and with a final flip of
its stern drew itself clear of its bonds
the disc-men of jupiter



mbelow she could see the vast spread of
 the giant disc on its surface glowed
not one but a dozen spots their rays stab-
bing ton late after the escaping craft break-
ing away from the edges came whole genera-
tions of spinning pursuers shooting their
tendrils after the fugitive the nonpareil
gathered speed left them behind lying on
the slanted surface of the hull she felt her
weight grew apparently much greater she
dropped her ray-gun wound both arms
around the cleat and prayed for strength
to maintain her hold

  in years to come she was to remember as
in a nightmare how the disc-creatures fell
away grew smaller and dimmer until they
were swallowed in the butter-colored fog
how the light below grew fainter and the
light above grew brighter how at last the
mists thinned away and she cleared her
vision to see that they were in free space
with the sun at an angle overhead and the
blessed stars sprinkled over a sky as black
as a velvet cloak

  still she clung while the cold of space
crept in to banish the stuffy heat of inner
jupiter she felt lighter too and more sure
of herself soon she would attempt to crawl
to that nearest lock panel and tap for ad-
mission

  but the panel slid open a helmeted head
came into view and turned its glass front
toward her then two gloved hands reached
out she felt them on her shoulders and
now she seemed to grow light indeed as light
as thistledown so that she would float away
but for those strong hands that held her

things grew dim then black before her eyes
she slid into silent oblivion

  when she awoke she lay on a pallet in
the control room bromburgs face with
brows furrowed in concern bent close to
hers over his shoulders she could see du-
velskoe at the keyboard the pieces of her
space suit scattered on the floor all the
familiar instruments and furnishings of the
compartment an arm was under her head-
bromburgs

  she reached up a finger and touched his
cheek his flesh was firm and comforting
to feel

  situation well in hand he said then
smiled when she nodded

  you were wonderful he told her could
either of us have done more i think not

  it was downright heroic put in duvel-
skoe

  i had to do it said thiana id dragged
you into such an awful mess it was up to
me to get you out of it now do you think
well of me at last

 think well of you i never thought
otherwise

  really she touched his cheek again
letting her hand linger in a caress he
turned his head and kissed it

  do we-love each other she asked al-
most timidly

 he did not answer but duvelskoe saw
their faces draw together quickly the lieu-
tenant turned to study the chart on the table
across the room where the indicator pointed
toward the red spark that was mars and
beyond that the dot that was earth

the important part of that heavy water plays in the fife processes
of ail living creatures is the basis of a fascinating and
scientifically stimulating masterpiece of fiction-

coin before the arbiter president doyle called the matter of atomic power to the machines attention

the arbiter

by john russell learn

     the thing was of metal-but it walked and thought like a
     man ard was a grim object of deadly peril and menace

the year of -and peace  	man slim wiry with gray hair swept back

the wreckage of past ages of barbar-	from an expansive brow there was little to

ism had been cleared away all over	stamp him as extraordinary unless it was

the earth stood flawless cities the peoples	the resolute tightness of his lips or the

had nothing to complain of they lived in a	squareness of his chin here was a man who

tempered happy world of smoothly working	reasoned decided and then acted

machines and vast foolproof control panels	he had accomplished all that he had set

but in this there perhaps lay the seeds of	out to do and molded the world afresh

danger	it gave him pleasure to sit as he was now

selby doyle president of the earth voted	in the dim half light of the lowering night

into office by common consent was a shrewd	his chair tilted back on its hind legs his


the arbiter	

gray eyes gazing on the lights of major city
as they sprang automatically into being at
the scheduled times the lower lights first
then the higher ones as the tide of day ebbed
from the deeper walks

  presentlyhe glanced round as the warning
light on his great desk proclaimed some-
bodys approach instantly he was the chief
magistrate-self-possessed ready for his
visitor he closed the switches which filled
the room with an intense yet restful bril-
liance

  the automatic door opened doyle sat
looking at the tall man who crossed the
threshold vincent carfax chairman of the
committee for public welfare inclined his
bald head in greeting

  your excellency he acknowledged and
stepped forward to shake hands

  doyle waved him to a chair carfax was
an inhuman index of a man who carried
endless statistics in his agile brain poker-
faced emaciated as a skeleton it was his
proud boast that he had never been known
to smile

   you will overlook the lateness of the hour
mr president he asked at length in his
precise voice

  i was about to leave doyle answered
however only an important matter could
bring you here carfax what is it

   unrest

   unrest president doyle raised his eye-
brows unrest in major city my dear
fellow

  unrest carfax insisted i have
suspected it for a long time but ive re-
frained from bringing it to your notice until
i was absolutely certain now i have con-
clusive evidence major city is resting on
quicksand your excellency

oyle pondered for a moment tell me
    about it he invited

  the facts are plain carfax answered
slowly the reaction of perfect security
after many years spent in wars and struggle
is going directly against the adaptive strain
nature builds up i have had the first in
biology check on that the human body and
mind keyed to every emergency had until
recently something it could grapple with
now there is nothing but perfection the
mind has of necessity to find a new form of
excitation in order to maintain its equili-
brium do i make it clear

  i provided science for the people
president doyle said quietly is not that
exciting enough

   science sir is for the chosen few men
buch as you and i and all the other master-
brains who have brought this sublime state
into being are different call them geniuses
if you will at least they do not represent

the masses i have been forced to the un-
pleasant realization that very few minds are
adapted to scientific study just as in the
pre-wars era a man accepted the electric
light for what it is without involving him-
self in the electronic processes embodied in
it so today there is that same aspect of
laziness and torpor-and there mr presi- 
dent lie the seeds of unrest and mischief
doyle smiled it can be stopped the
congress has the power

  this goes deeper than you realize
carfax said shaking his bald head it is not
confined to major city it exists nearly
everywhere so much so i felt it my duty
to warn you if this unrest is not quelled it
means-back to war

  the chief executive was silent

  there is a way carfax said presently
  there is

  it is becoming increasingly clear that
the last war did not entirely kill the belief
in mens minds that force of arms is the only
sure way to right the element of unrest now
present will grow rapidly at the moment it
takes the form of vicious words it would
like to build up a barrier against all things
scientific and tear down the perfect structure
we have created but i say-if i may-that
the close of the last war really did end war
for ever

  perhaps the president smiled grayly
listen carfax resumed tapping his
finger emphatically on the desk we must
forever outlaw war as a disease until now
man has not had sufficient power at his dis-
posal-scientific power that is-to make his
dreams come true the earlier men tried it
with pacts treaties and leagues of nations-
and they all came to grief-because there
was no science back of them

  and now

  now with tremendous scientific re-
sources at our command we can make a
stand against this eternal enemy of progress
destroy it while it is still young carfax
hesitated briefly and looked apologetic
what i am about to say your excellency
may make it appear i am teaching you your
business you will forgive that

  doyle shrugged only a fool refuses to
learn continue

  many years ago men adopted the principle
of arbitration carfax resumed they were
enlightened enough in civil matters at least
to place any matter of dispute particularly
in instances of capital and labor before a
council usually composed of three experts
that council was vested with complete
power to say yes or no upon the point
at issue thus matters were arbitrated
endeavors were made futilely enough to
devise an arbitration scheme between na-
tions
	startling stories

  the principle of arbitration relied on the
good faith of nations to seek arbitration but
lost in a welter of power politics and over-
come with greed backed by terrific man
power and armaments wars followed wars
arbitration was ignored but sir the idea
was not lost why cannot a new arbiter
arise not a man not three men-but twelve
in olden times a jury was usually composed
of twelve men and women so in respect to
that judicial tradition let it still be twelve
twelve-to arbitrate

  president doyle sighed a little an excel-
lent idea old friend but what twelve men
or women however competent would be
accepted by the masses as sole judges

  there comes the difference the statisti-
cian said calmly i have been investigating
on my own account ever since this unrest
began i have pondered the idea of an
arbiter i have interviewed at great length
twelve men each one of them equipped with
the finest brain in the world for his partic-
ular sphere the twelve major sciences of
present day civilization can each have a
master at the head yes i have talked with
them each one of them has foreseen as we
have the grim fate that awaits mankind if
unrest is allowed to prevail now i have
their assurance once the word is made law-
ful by you that each one of them is pre-
pared to sacrifice his life for the particular
science he controls in order that the future
of mankind may be assured

oyle sat bolt upright sacrifice his
life he cried what on earth do you
mean man why should they

  because there can be no other way to
make a true arbiter

  the president got to his feet stood by the
window with his hands clasped behind him
go on he said lost in thought

  twelve brains will be pooled for the com-
mon good carfax explained twelve
brains will work in unison to provide a com-
mon answer and a just one for every
conceivable difficulty in every walk of life
twelve brains functioning ns one unit will
be the judge of humanitys future actions and
set discord at naught

  even brains die president doyle pointed
out turning it is only putting off the vital
issue for a short period when the brains die
the old trouble will be back this is just-
just a temporary panacea making things
comfortable for the present age what of pos-
terity carfax that is the problem we must
consider

  the brains will never die the statisti-
cian said and at doyles look of astonishment
he was tempted to smile but remembering
his one boast he didnt

  i said we could outlaw unrest and war

forever mr president this is no hasty
plan i have conferred with gascoyne the
first in anatomy he says the plan i have
devised is feasible did it ever occur to you
what a poor instrument the brain is for the
interpretation of thought

  often what of it

  gascoyne has asked himself that question
long enough to find an answer we of this
age know science agrees that thought is
everywhere that it is expressed in greater
or lesser degree according to the quality of
the receiver or brain interpreting it
according to gascoyne a brain is basically an
electric machine-a radio receiver if you
wish it in proportion to its quality it
absorbs and uses the ideas of all-pervading
mind and expresses ideas clearly or badly
through the medium of a physical body
which in itself is an expression of mind-
force

  doyle was clearly interested now a faint
unaccustomed flush of pleasure stole into
carfaxs pallid cheeks

  since then mind contains the quintes-
sence of every known science he went on
certain brains-or receivers-are better
fitted than others and can be completely
duplicated in a mechanical imperishable
mould every convolution of a brain every
neuron every synaptic resistance can be
imitated just as surely as in old days an im-
pression could be taken of a mans gums for
the fitting of false dentures it can be done
just as surely as the artificial leg of today
has false muscles

  president doyle came back to the desk and
stood waiting

  with your sanction carfax finished
slowly i propose to model twelve synthetic
imperishable brains on the exact convolu-
tions and measurements belonging to these
twelve scientists it will be done in the
fashion of taking a death-mask the image
of the face at death remains in the mask
forever in this case the mechanical brains
will be modeled over the real ones dupli-
cating them in every detail when this has
been done the mechanical equivalent will
take over from the natural organ probably
with even better results because it will be
devoid of the inevitable clogging ofhuman
construction the real brain will shrivel
and die afterwards leaving the mechanical
image

  once the operation is complete these
mechanical brains will be linked together
will go on gaming knowledge with a speed
compatible with that of an ordinary brain
if it were permitted to five for eternity
that is how the arbiter will become inde-
structible and a paragon of justice for all
mankind

  doyle thought then shook his head
the arbiter	

  even though i am the elected executive
of all earth carfax i am still human
twelve men to die if i give the word-it is
unthinkable

  the statistician got to his feet his pale
face adamant

  as the chief magistrate doyle you have
to a certain extent to be devoid of emotion
you spoke of posterity posterity can be
assured by your word-now and remember
the twelve will give their lives voluntarily
think of the thousands of scientists in the
past who have given their lives willingly
for a less cause

  but the decision to slay twelve did not
rest with one man president doyle pointed
out then he turned impatiently carfax
dont misunderstand me i see the value of
your idea i appreciate the great lengths you
must have been to to get the plan worked
but it would be better if the decision did not
rest so completely with me

carfax shrugged the facts are plain
enough he said quietly the personal
brain power of the twelve best men will be
pooled twelve will die in order that thou-
sands to come may live in peace

  after a brief silence doyle began to hedge
with vague desperation he drummed his
fingers on the desk there was an inhuman
persuasion in carfaxs cold emotionless
voice

  what guarantee have we that opposing
factions will consult the arbiter in any
case

  we have the guarantee of twelve im-
perishable brains in a mobile machine-a
machine controlled by thought waves react-
ing on special mechanisms in the event of
two opposing factions the arbiter will cut
off all possible means that might lead to force
between the parties concerned compulsory
arbitration will come into being its that-
or decay

  it is ruling by force doyle muttered
our present method is by votes

  it is common sense all other scientists
are strongly in favor of the plan i con-
vinced them of its value that leaves only
your sanction

  not immediately my friend i must
think the president pressed a hand to his
forehead leave me for a while i must
talk with gascoyne first ill acquaint you
with my decision later

  as something apart he heard the soft
click of the door as carfax went  

  even after he had heard rolf gascoynes
fudy detailed surgical description of the idea
of the arbiter it took president doyle
several more days of deliberation before he
finally gave his consent to the project and
he did it then only when he was assured of

the willingness of the twelve men concerned
to sacrifice themselves in order that posterity
might have an assured peace

  so he gave the order-and with the twelve
men and gascoyne he shut himself away
from city affairs for a while in the surgical
laboratories

  he answered no calls except those which
demanded his personal attention leaving
everything else to carfax his deputy

  from then on doyle watched activity in a
field which was unfamiliar to him lie saw
the twelve human beings go willingly under
the anaesthetic he saw the brains still
living being fed by synthetic bloodstream
and artificial heart then under orders from
gascoyne the first brain was duly imprisoned
within a soft mould of ductile metal

  atom by atom molecule by molecule
under the control of instruments so sensitive
that light-vibration disturbed them metallic
moulds were set up fitted into place by
slender rods of force timed to a split
thousandth of a second the slightest error in
which would have meant utter failure

  but there was no error gascoyne saw to
that he was coldly efficient intolerant of
mistakes the controlling forces made no
slip they had no human qualities in them
to err

  day after day the scientists worked on
from time to time doyle received disquieting
reports from carfax concerning the rapid
increase of unrest amongst the unscientific
populace he handed the information on to
gascoyne who promptly made a speed-up
all round

  in a month the first brain was complete
the dried shell of the dead brain was
removed and the mechanical counterpart
deadly precise in its way of reasoning came
into being the actual entity of unwin
slater first in mathematics had vanished
and given place to the computations of brain
unit no l

  thereafter it was not difficult assured
now of success in the operation doyle felt
a little more easy in mind-and the experts
worked steadily on brain after brain was
linked up until at the end of three months
the transference was complete the knowl-
edge of each was unified to the other by
delicate vibratory wires and thence carried
back to a central brain pan-in truth a
contrivance of machinery of profound com-
plexity reactive only to the thoughts of
twelve combined brains

  gascoyne had been clever here without
twelve brains in unity the machinery would
not function and since this seat of all motiva-
tion and pooled knowledge was protected by
metals of interlocking atoms the arbiter
was absolutely foolproof in fact the more
the atoms of the housing metal continued


startling stories

to disorganize the more impossible it would
be to break down

an october   the arbiter became
visible in public for the first time in
appearance it resembled a great circle of
metal about fifty feet wide studded at
regular intervals round the edge with un-
breakable domes which sheathed the metal-
lic brains inside the wires protected by
similar armor led directly to the circles
center wherein stood the governing mach-
ine-unit for locomotion the thing possessed
skillfully jointed metal legs perfectly bal-
ancing the circle of metal they carried in
many ways the arbiter resembled an enor-
mous wheel studded with twelve nodules
and supplied with feet

  in response to public demand after
doyles initial introduction of it and outline
of its purpose it gave a brief speech world-
relayed its thought waves passing into
photoelectric devices which in turn forced
air through replicas of human vocal cords
produced a voice that was completely im-
partial and yet arresting

  people of the world you are asked to
 forget that this contrivance is the carrier of
 twelve brains the great machine snidvr
 is a unity a single unity with a twewe-rold
 purpose that purpose is peace on earth and
 goodwill towards men to that end i the
 arbiter will work let any man or woman
 who thinks of transgressing the peace pause
 now and think the arbiter stands ready
 thereafter the arbiter was allowed com-
 plete liberty it was entirely self-contained
 sleepless it moved as it chose but usually
 stayed pretty close to major city

   its first decisive action was to subdue to a
 considerable extent the activities of the
 restive ones with an uncanny sense of
 deduction it unearthed a plot whereby a
 thousand unscientific insurgents were plot-
 ting to seize a territory between major city
 and its nearest neighbor one hundred miles
 away the insurgents had hoped to estab-
 lish a colony for themselves had they
 succeeded they would undoubtedly have been
 the first to break the unity of a great world-
 wide nation in which all class distinction
 and creed had been leveled into one brother-
 hood

   but the arbiter sifted the rebels plans
 from top to bottom and since in this case
 there was no question of arbitration between
 parties the mechanical judge took the next
 most effective step

   one by one the entire thousand met death
 ruthlessly inexplicably-but certainly the
 scientists became a little worried that the
 first act of the arbiter should be to slay
 without question was something of a shock

   if it did nothing else the action at least

 quelled all the other restive spirits they
 turned in increasing numbers to scientific
 study finding an unexpected pleasure in the
 struggle to wrest the ultimate secrets from
 nature

   thereafter for a year the arbiter had little
 of importance to do it sorted out minor
 disputes vfrith calm emotionless words and
 its decision was implicitly obeyed president
 selby doyle felt satisfied his first fears had
 vanished the arbiter was a panacea after
 all then came the affair of grenson the
 physicist

  grenson a young and ardent man of the
 new era was sure that he had discovered
 the real meaning of an electrons wave and
 particle motion working alone in his labor-
 atory he knew that he was on the verge of
 probing the long sought for secret of power
 from the atom

  immediately he went to the president
 stood at the desk and looked for the fust
 time upon the quiet calm personage who
 ruled the world

  sit down young man doyle invited at
 last eying his visitor steadily and inwardly
 deciding that he liked him sit down and
 give me the full details

  grenson gathered his courage president
 doyle snapped a recording switch then he sat
 back to listen to the rush of eager excited
 phrases for fifteen minutes grenson held
 forth on the possibilities of his invention
 still theoretical and through it all the chief
 executive sat in silence linking up the points
 in his keen mind fitting together postulation
 with postulation bringing his own far-reach-
 ing knowledge to bear on the subject

  at last grenson became silent flushed
 with his own energies

  doyle gave him an encouraging smile
in theory young man i should say your
scheme is feasible if so you may be sure
that major city will fully reward you but
first we must have advice in this very
specialized field he pressed the switch of
his intercom send in the first in physics
he ordered

kor ten minutes president and worker
 sat in silence the young man looking
round the great office and doyle busy at his
desk then horley dodd the first in
physics arrived-a sharp-nosed scrub-
headed man with thick-lensed eyeglasses

  you want me sir his tone was by no
 means pleasant

  yes dodd i do this young man here
 if his theory is as good as it sounds has the
 secret of atomic power just listen to the
 playback of his exposition

  president doyle flicked a button there
 was silence as grensons eager voice came
 forth from the audiograph the first in
the arbiter	

physics stood with his hands locked behind
him biting his lower lip and staring up at
the ceiling the voice ceased at last an
automatic switch started the sound track
ribbon reeling back to the start again

  well the president asked leaning back
in his chair

  frankly id say its impossible dodd
said briefly it is at best a mere theory and
as such does not advance us one iota beyond
what we already know

  that is a very narrow viewpoint the
president observed

  dodds sharp little eyes sparked defiance
its the only viewpoint your excellency

  but sir i have it all worked out gren-
son sprang to his feet earnestly naturally
i am a man of only moderate means i can-
not afford the costly apparatus necessary to
prove my idea that is why i brought the
scheme to the president now you say its
no good 

  you had no right to bring it here dodd
snapped

  he had every right the president said
what is more dodd i have neither time nor
patience for this unseemly wrangling he
got to his feet decisively we have the
arbiter to decide such things for us come
into the laboratory both of you

  he preceded the pair to a sealed interdoor
and opened it they passed within to the
monster of legs and nodules occupying the
center of the floor

  arbiter a question arises president
doyle stated quietly stopping before the
things sensitive pickup is the theory of
atomic force about to be given to you practi-
cal-or not he turned aside and switched
on a relay of grensons voice-record again
that silence and grenson stood with his gaze
uncertainly watching the glittering monster
that was to determine his lifes ideal

   after long thought at the close of the expo-
sition the arbiter spoke

  the theory of grenson is not practicable
the secret of atomic power will never be
found because the very nature of the atom
makes it impossible the judgment is
awarded to horley dodd

  the first in physics smiled acidly and
glanced at the president doyle was stroking
his chin slowly then he turned to the dazed
grenson and patted him gently on the
shoulder

  i am sorry my boy-i really am i did
feel that you had something but the arbiter
cannot be wrong the decision is final

  final grenson shouted do you think
i am going to take the opinion of a thing like
this-this arbiter do you think i shall
give up a theory because a few canned brains
say so not on my life im going on and
on yes ill make the money somehow to

prove my idea

  he swung round red-faced with anger
and vanished through the doorway doyle
watched him go then shrugged

  youre too sentimental mr president
dodd said brusquely you allow too many
of these crack-brained theorists to take ad-
vantage of you he has the wrong idea
entirely what he and his sort need is con-
trol not encouragement

   as long as i am chief magistrate i shall
make my own decisions doyle answered
quietly i shall not need to detain you any
longer dodd thank you for coming

   the scientist went out and president doyle
returned slowly into his own office stood by
the desk thinking that young man had had
a great idea and somehow he was convinced
it should have been tested

  it was towards evening when the private
wire buzzed doyle took up the receiver and
vincent carfaxs lean cold visage came onto
the screen

  your excellency i understand from my
agents that you had a young man to see you
today chap named grenson and that
the decision of the arbiter went against
him

   correct

   he died at five thirty this afternoon he
was slain by mind-force from the arbiter
i thought it would interest you

doyle stared at the screen fixedly you
are sure

  i never make mistakes carfax answered
dispassionately i dont like it this con-
tinued display of force

  no neither do i

   president doyle cut off his jaw set with
uncommon hardness he got to his feet and
walked into the adjoining laboratory stood
staring at the metal monster even as he
stood making his survey he could sense the
inhuman aura the thing radiated

  arbiter you slew without provocation
he snapped suddenly why i demand to
know you told grenson he was wrong but
what need was there to murder him as well
that question is outside your province
you are the president yes but you had me
created for the undisputed adjudication of
all matters capable of argument for the
carrying out of these adjudications after-
wards the only way to prevent a continued
disobedience of commands is to kill gren-
son in spite of my decision was determined
to work in spite of me so he died so it
must always be with those who are defiant
otherwise the purpose of the arbiter is lost
but its barbarism president doyle
cried hoarsely the very thing i believed
youd stop

  i am not answerable to anybody for what
	startling stories

i believe or think the arbiter answered
implacably

  but suppose young grenson had been
right suppose he had touched the verge
of unlocking atomic power think what it
could have meant to us we need that power
earths stores of petroleum coal and cer-
tain metals cannot last much longer sup-
plies were drained to the uttermost in
building and equipping the cities atomic
power would solve many things at one bound
even the correct transmutation of elements
a secret we desperately need to find at the
least you could have let grenson go on
experimenting

  not in face of my decision i acted as i
saw best so far as i am concerned the
matter is finished

  doyle hesitated staring at the thing bit-
terly then with clenched fists he went slowly
from the laboratory somewhere he knew
something was wrong the treasured plans
for security had gone utterly awry

  very gradually it was forced on the ad-
herants of scientific progress that the arbiter
was anything but what it was intended to be
science became divided into two camps-
the strugglers and the opposers with dodd
as chief of the opposers

  dodd though a scientist firmly believed
in the inaccessibility of natures inner
secrets and had neither vision nor tolerance
he was too content to accept science for what
it was rather than for what it might become
in that very fact lay the seed of disaster
the camp of science divided against itself
began to show signs of decay

  time and again the arbiter was called in
and every time the verdict went to horley
dodd and his party baffled sickened by the
obvious breakdown in the scheme for uni-
versal peace president selby doyles grip
on things commenced to weaken already
worn out with the cares of office to which
had been added crushing disappointment the
illness which preceded his demise was brief

  officials were present round his death bed
-but officials were all they were men who
had served him because it had been their
duty to serve to the dying president there
was only one face which represented loyalty
and friendship and it belonged to vincent
carfax

  carfax you must be president doyle
whispered as-as it is my final wish you
will be chosen all around this bed are the
men who will elect you i have their promise

i think that i have-have been too lenient
but no such emotions will trouble you car-
fax you are younger you are an expert
scientist you must defeat this arbiter my
friend find out why it has turned traitor
you promise

  i promise carfax answered

  president doyle relaxed and smiled it was
a smile that remained fixed the president
of the earth was dead

  an hour later the assembled scientists all
of them leaders on the side of the strugglers
filed into the main office to face their new
president they found carfax at the great
desk coldly silent he waited until the
group was fully assembled surveyed them
then got to his feet

  gentlemen for seven years now we have
been chained hand and foot by an invention
of our own making-a metal dictator-and it
has betrayed as we dont know why yet
-but we do know that unless we defy this
arbiter or find forces which can destroy it
we are a doomed people

dascoyne shook his head we cannot
 destroy it-at least not in the light of
present scientific knowledge he said seri-
ously we made the thing of a metal whose
atoms interlock remember it is sealed for-
ever we made it foolproof-and to what
end

  it is in our own hands to determine the
end president carfax retorted unless we
act were finished it is the very law of the
universe that there must be progress every
day now brings us up against new difficulties
sources of power are running low new
sources intended for us by nature are
barred because the brains that would develop
them are prevented by this twelve-brained
monstrosity i tell you we must defeat it

  assured that he might be able to succeed
president carfax went to work to prove his
words the strugglers began anew the
experiments which had been truncated by
the death of grenson

  they worked to within an ace of solving
the secret of atomic power carfax himself
got far enough to extract a terrific amount of
energy from a cube of copper from in-
credibly small pieces of highly conductive
metal he built up a model power plant which
on a giant scale would replace the already
sadly worn electric equipment from which
the cities derived their light and power

  the other scientists explored different
realms some reasoned out new methods of
synthesis by which the fast waning supplies
of oil and coal could be replaced another
was convinced that he had transmutation of
metals in his grip with which the cities could
be repaired as time went on yet another
saw his chance of harnessing the waste
energy of the sun

  by degrees under carfaxs fine leadership
the determined scientists began to lay plans
for the foundation of real utopia

  then the arbiter struck in a public speech
it declared that the discoveries claimed by
president vincent carfax and his colleagues
the arbiter	

were nothing better than fancy the arbiter
took sides with the opposers and launched
a small but savagely effective massacre
against the strugglers in three days of
desperate skirmish and slaughter carfax and
his followers were wiped out horley dodd
leader of the opposers was killed too not
that it signified much the opposers were
now in complete control backed always by
the impartial arbiter

  languid with victory the opposers lazily
repaired the damage and then sat back to
enjoy the comforts which vincent carfax
had sworn were coming to an end apathy
set in bom of lack of anything to accomplish
even the arbiter had nothing left to judge
the final vanquishment had shown to the
opposers that progress was a form of disease
and entirely unnecessary better to relax
and enjoy the fruits of labor

  the year  passed away and was fol-
lowed by a gap of somnolent drifting years
until  nothing had been accomplished
nothing done life was one grand bliss of
effortless satisfaction the pioneers were
lost in the mists of memory science as an
art had ceased to be

 ---and the arbiter was
still in faultless condition indeed it had been
made indestructible

  men and women died children were bom
in limited numbers grew up each one know-
ing less of science than those before them
astronomy physics mathematics they
were things the ancients had studied said the
history records somewhere in the smeared
archives was the name of selby doyle

  then in  came the first warnings of
the trouble carfax had forseen the weather-
controlling machinery broke down its central
bearings worn out from continued inatten-
tion in consequence the weather suddenly
reverted to its former unreliable state and
deluged whole continents of synthetic crops
destroyed a worlds food supply for a year

  hurricanes tore across the world cities
which were slowly eroding through continued
lack of repaii- eroded still more that gray
metal so shiny at first was cracking now
flaking under the continued onslaught of the
elements

 a nervous flurry passed through the
people for the first time they were really
alarmed they rushed to the weather con-
trolling station but could only stare help-
lessly at silent useless machinery knowl-
edge was dead

  this was not all trouble came thick and
fast with the failure of the crops animals
began to die off the machines that tended
them only functioned so long as they received
-from still other machines-steady supplies
of crops specially developed for cattle con-
sumption when the supply stopped the

machines stopped too and nobody knew what
to do about it

rbhe seed of disaster flourished with ter-

	rific speed burst the foundations of the
formerly calm cities and upset the tran-
quillity of the pleasure-softened people the
collapse of the weather machinery presaged
the overture to the end blinding cataracts
of rain seeped through corroded roofs the
water short-circuiting the vital power and
light machinery already at breaking point
through wear and tear

  light and power failed in each city simul-
taneously famine reared over a disturbed
turmoiled world gut about with scurrying
clouds in desperation the people turned to
the arbiter their leader

  but the arbiter did nothing it ignored
the wild pleas hurled at it marched out of
the insecure laboratory that was its home
and departed into the storm-lashed country
in the hour of need it had deserted them

  panic seized the people at the realization
they fled from the cities whither they knew
not floundered in a mad exodus seeking food
that was not there cursing aloud to the
heavens because synthesis had destroyed all
natural growth and cultivation specializa-
tion had been proved a tragedy escape from
a world which was too perfect became an
obsession

  gradually inevitably it was forced upon
the people in those hours of mad struggle
and desperation that they were face to face
with certain extinction

  panic and struggle had gone a
strange calm was on the world cities
crumbled through disuse ravaged by tempest
and flood poked blind inquisitive spires to
cleared skies the sun crossed a sky which
was in the main peaceful again climate
had adjusted back to its normal vagaries

  but the soft winds of spring the hot sun
of summer the cool chill of the fall and the
heavy snows of winter fell on bones that
were scattered white and forgotten across
earths face alone in this world of empti-
ness where natural grass and trees were
trying once more to struggle through there
moved a cumbersome affair of metal still
cold and impartial inhuman and relentless
it climbed mountains it prowled plains it
searched the ruins of cities it brooded alone
the arbiter

   ad  ad then the venusians
came

  they were strange birdlike creatures
masters of space travel lords of their own
peculiar science they came not as con-
querors but with the intention of making
friends with the third-world people their
amazement was complete when they could
not find a soul alive


startling stories

  then eventually they found the arbiter
with their superior science they analyzed it
probed its deepest secrets broke open the
supposedly impregnable sheathing by four-
dimensional tools

the venusians remained on earth for

	several days while the leading scientist
cor santu pondered over the curious mys-
tery of a lost race from studying the dis-
sembled arbiter and the still remaining rec-
ords of human events transcribed by the
leader of languages he built up an explana-
tion of the problem

  poor earthly scientists was his final
comment brilliant men indeed-bot they
forgot one thing if a world or people is to
survive it must have progress even as we
have found in our own experience wars
are indeed evil and should be prevented
but dictators are worse right alone can
prevail in the end

  selby doyle and vincent carfax did not
trust to right to a universal mind control
for guidance no they invented a machine
of twelve mechanical brains to bring them
peace such a device could not solve the
problem they forgot that a brain in pro-
gressing must expand we have seen that in
any case these earth beings only used a
fifth of their full brain capacity that later
would have developed but in the machine

they strangled it carfax and the surgeon
gascoyne made these mechanical brains fixed
to what was at that time the present to
the arbiter it was always the present being
rigid metal the imprisoned brains could not
expand could not go a step beyond the day
of their creation that is why the arbiter
destroyed all things that suggested progress
and also because it feared any sign of
progress would bring its power to an end
it was just another dictator

 such metal bound brains living in a
past world could not visualize anything
progressive conservationism gone mad
from the instant the brains were moulded
of metal they deteriorated and having no
human sentiment they destroyed without
question so when the great catastrophe
came the arbiter was powerless-as power-
less as all the others who had not kept pace
with progress nature must progress or
perish that is evolution

  thereon cor santu ended his observations
but when his fleet of spaceships soared
through the sunny sky towards fresh worlds
of exploration there was left behind a
smashed irreparable mass of melted cogs
wires and wheels it was a rusting monu-
ment to a race that had died-a race that
had fallen prey to laziness and surrendered
its freedom to the ruthless whims of a
machine

he explains his insults

by ed farnham

 dear sir i am writing this letter for uie sole
specific purpose of explaining just why i wrote the
so very insuiung letter to ye sarge a few weeks
ago

  st

  the letter was written for the sole purpose of stir-
ring up a rumpus in tev and trs in an effort to put
some life into both i deliberately insulted three
writers and ye sarge i also insulted the author of
the latest c future

  nd

  since it is apparent that the letter is not to see
print i am writing this to apologize to all
concerned as it is my desire to correct if possible
the impression which i know my last letter created
to wit that i ed famham am one dyed-in-the-
wool pure-bred skonk

  rd

  i would like to offer my most sincere deeply humble
and repentent apologies and to herein ask your for-
giveness for that letter for the reasons stated
above
the ether vibrates	

  thrilling wonder stories and startling stories have
always been are now and always will be the best
in their field however i reserve the right tn
find fault when and where i see fit doing so only
when and where i feel justified

  trusting that you-among others-will for this once
grant me a full pardon and assuring you of con-
tinued support- east th street chicago is
illinois

  since your editor honestly has no memory
of the alleged insult he is a trifle baffled by
the above whom else could you have of-
fended ed come on and let us in on it-
especially since your most prodigious insults
bounced merrily off this leathery editorial
hide into the waste basket

orchids and onions

by gerry t crane

  dear editor  have two orchids and two onions
for you also a query the query first

  are you and your mate of tws the same person
  now for the orchids

  x i love kuttncr hammond hamilton leinster
please continue

   thanks for abolishing your one dark spot-
those bemlins

  and now the onions

   everyone knows kuluier is hammond so why
keep up the doubletalk

   everyone slug- marchioni and raves over fin-
lay personally i hate finlay and while im not fond
of marchioni i preler him ouch but this waste-
basket is hard-but  still love you-albany new
york

  answer to query-yes oh yes alas yes
thanks for the purty flowers as for your
kuttner-hammond sirloin-if they were the
same which we are in no sense admitting
it would make our contents pages look like
the devil to have so many of the same author
present as for finlay us marchioni-your
taste is your own but youre taking your
life into your own big feet gerry

favor for a lady

by mrs rose la savio

  dear sir this is the first time ive written you
i have a special favor to ask and hope you can help
me out- but first comments on the january ss

  the star of life by hamilton is pretty good
but tell me why did thayne marden have to die
why couldnt she and kirk hammond live happily

ever after-or something like that- otherwise i liked
it very much

  travelers tale is okay however it should
have been longer and more definite why doesnt
wliiuey write a novel for ss friends and venus
mines inc were fair

  the dark world in the july issue by kuttner
is very much like a merritt merritt had more fan-
tasy in his stories but just the same kuttner is good

  all of which leads me to my favor i have had
merritts burn witch burn his the moon
pool and dwellers in the mirage but i cnn-
not get hold of creep shadow creep the face
in the abyss or the ship of ishtar do you
know how i can get hold of them id appreciate very
much any help you can give me- southern ooule-
vard bronx  new york

 okay-students somebody give mrs la
savio the information she needs all the ed
knows is that he had for a time in the sum-
mer of  a reprint pocket sized two-bit

edition of the face in the abyss
which has since vanished

 so you want a happy ending on hamil-
tons piece tsk tsk shame besides who
lives happily ever after-while married at
any rate it is our impression that such deli-
cate adult adjustments demand a lot more
than fatuous bliss at any rate you give
kuttner a pat on the back-if a faint-hearted
one write us again and get your other ear
pinned neatly back

whats the good ward

by rex e ward

  gentlemen the star of life by edmond hamil-
ton takes first-place honor by far in the january
 issue of course that is only to be expected
when you see edmoud hamilton tacked on a story
without a doubt ed is the best writer in the field-in
my opinion

  in second place is venus mines incorporated by

nat schaclmer  arthur leo zagat i was certainly
glad to see a story in print again by a couple of old-
timers among the best too it definately is worthy

of the publication it received in tlio hall of fame

  travelers tale by george whitley was an in-
teresting little short more from this authors type-
writer will be welcome

  in last place is murray leinsters friends it
was good very good in fact id call it a tie with
whitleys

  im lad to see leo morey back he always was one
of my favorite artists by the wav the cover this
issue was excellent one of bergeys best i that
fellows good-hang on to him one of the greatest
things youve done yt is to start to uphold him in th
ether vibrates

  also im glad that murray leinsters finally doing
a novel for startling stories its his first and ill
wager itll be his best

  heres something for you to mull over for the next
two or three years dont forget that in june s the
first issue of thrilling wonder stories appeared on
the stands that means that in june  itll be
that magazines twentieth anniversary lets have
something big then and the same for startling in
 itll be startlings tenth anniversary then per-
haps the paper shortage will ease up a bit by then and
we can combine the two magazines in one gigantic
issue and really make a hit- main street el
scgundo california

  thanks for the hoopla rex old bean but
hold on there and dont let those statistics
drop until we can peruse them with a mag-
nifying lens

  you are we discover correct on leinster
never before doing a novel for ss and on
the birthdate of this magazine january 
but thrilling wonder was born in
august  becoming thrilling won-
der stories in february  it is true
that wonder stories its sire saw the
light in june  but that is another story
and another magazine the gigantic issue
you speak of sounds like on heck of an edi-
torial head and backache however well
see   

ravin from slavin

by rickey slovin

  dear sir im writing this as an apology both to
myself and edmond hamilton- you see for quite a
while i was under the misapprehension that his stories
startling stories



were hack and not worth reading i found out my
mistake when i read star of life in the jan ss

  it was great mainly because it described emotions
and thoughts as i would like to experience them and
also because there was much truth in what he said
the catch in the gift of everlasting life has been
written of and spoken of before but  doubt that
any other writer could have made it hit so near home

  evolution and its results have been a hobby of
mine lor many years i know that i have no real
education in the field but i prefer to think what the
effects of accelerated evolution would be and their
effect on human beings it does not seem so foolish
as it may sound but there is always the thought that
man may not like to realize that there would be a
time when all his doings have been superseded by a
greatly superior race	t 

  did you warn me that all the pics were to be by
marchioni well except for the ones for the shorts
and the illegible signature of leo morey or some-
thing

  perusing the letter column i came across the name
of one of my fellow esfa members lee budoff i
never realized that she was a poet but so are you for
that matter where in the seven green-colored moons
of xanthippe is joe kennedy chad oliver and
sneary had nothing to do with the boredom that came
immediately i realized that there was no letter from
joe

  hmm i had to wait till i got a little calmer before
i could think about the cover if bergey has to
have scantily-clad females why doesnt he include a
note about where we could get those lovely-ummm-
bras and unmentionables- coney island ave
bklj jo new york

 dear miss slavin-my dear miss slavin
yours is the most unique comment on the
bergey covers weve yet seen

it had to happen to us

by william e rose

raymond hass has went and said it now i have no
  cause to dread it

a i strive to tell in halting rhyme and runes

for it was a duty civic to tell off in terms specific
this most select and balmy bunch of goons

as the four that raymond mentions and in spite of
good intentions
they are ready for those comfy padded rooms

poor old gabriels puerile lootings bring forth dark
  and mute

computings of the gallows and uie rifle and the ax
while my blood comes near congealing at the brassy
jackass pealing
of old chaddy rickie sneary and the joke

tell me why oh doughty saturn do you let this stuff
  so slattern

clutter pages of an erstwhile solid book

render hass should be commended if you do os he
  intended

in assisting dear old bergey in his work

photograph these ardent fellows withwithout their
hot-air bellows
and on the covers of our mag just let them
smirk-p o box  beaumont texas

 as the august genral manager
 of a rose more gray than tanger
 tool company of beaumont down in tex
 may your backside soon be tender
 as a second-time offender
 for you know just how we treat you
 horses necks

 for while one verse submission
 may air out your erudition
 a double dose of verse aint bad-its
 verse

  so retract your horrid braying

 which in truth is most dismaying
 before your editor calls out die hearse

  and while a rose by any name may still
    be quite as red

  we cannot help but feel that this one
    should have stood in bed

 for some reason we cant for the life of
us figure out we seem to wish we could
think of something to rhyme with mr roses
last word-le smirk perhaps some of you
can help us out and apply it to him

we attain varsity standing

by peter w toppan

  dear sir the first sclc-nce-flclion novel i ever read
was a captain future story it was by bren sterling
it was good very good that was three years ago and
i have been reading science fiction ever since last
winter i read outlaw world another captain
future novel by ed hamilton it was the most excit-
ing stf story i ever passed my eyes over i didnt
work i didnt eat i didnt sleep until i had finished it

  i recently read the solar invasion by manly
wade wellman which appeared in the fall issue of
ss if i had never heard of captain future before 
would have rated the story ns fair however after
the hamilton yam it was the most complete letdown
i ever experienced in stf wellman leans on the
wonderful characters created by another author to
pull through his weak plot he makes of cap future
a characterless superman will ss become a maga-
zine which mama reads to her boy of five as he
snuggles comfortably in her lap i hope not

  the three short stories were all good keep it up
with the accent on leinster and hamilton ss is
one of the best stf magazines published-afattheioa 
harvard unlcerjity cambridpe massachusetts

 as captain future and his comrades were
hamiltons crcation there is no question but
that he handled the entire concept better
than anyone else but during the war there
was alas no hamilton so brett sterling
took over and did an excellent job until he
too got called up manly wade wellmans
gain we thought carried on the future tra-
dition nobly-and were sorry it disappointed
you

off the space
by tom pace

  dear sir everything and everyone goes through a
slow evolution viewpoints psychologies likes and dis-
likes   all change with age and experience and
it is just such a change in attitude that  have re-
cently experienced science-fiction isnt just what
it was to me a couple of years ago   even a year
ago i blush deeply whenever i read a letter i had
the misfortune to have printed a year or so ago  
anyway i am trying to live up to the new era in
stf as reflected in sargies new personality the sharp
rise in the stf outlook and a growing public seienre-
consciousness ive noticed that a great many other
fans seem to feel this way now change for the bet-
ter

  i too knocked bergey i tui dislike slavering hor-
rors on my stf magazines but im gradually coming
to the decision fostered by the cover on the fall
tws that bergey is one of my favorites

  who hissed traitor

  to the stories  hamiltons lead novel was cer-
tainly in the new tradition much more of this
and the die-hards who squawk about the good old
days will die of frustration well-written as is ex-
pected from hamilton colorful and full of that ele-
ment which hamilton himself in meet the author
calls wonder to my mind this element of won-
der-always with the capital wl-la the basis of all
science-fiction
the ether vibrates	

  the two short stories are both one so much so
that its hard to rat them i do believe that leinsters
friends takes cards over whitleys travelers
tale   by a small margin very small both are
the new era type

  friends was fascinating in the concept of twin-
ning an idea  definitely an idea

  this story by the way goes in a certain category
long with one or two tales by fellows named theo-
dore sturgeon chan davis anson macdonald   
lewis padgett has written one or two and so have
cliff simak and robert heinlein you know the stories
i mean and the thing that those stories are talking
about the unpleasant thing

  the thing that most people dont talk about because
they cant visualize it and those who can dont talk
about it simply because they can visualize it

  im glad at least that theres a literature based
on the ability to wonder what happens when a plus
b equals the square root of infinity instead of the com-
monplace c hows that sarge campbell and you
other boys for a definition of science-flctlon

  i hall with pleasure the future of stf in tws and
ss more kuttner leinster company eh plus a
femme who writes like leigh brackett and sakl
that sarge i must read

  and will read-brewster florida

  no comment on this one save for a rous-
ing and wondering cheer

spiteful respite

by tom jewett

  dear sir i am ceasing my fan activities reading
fanews so that i might comment on the jan ish of
good old startling

  the star of life by our veteran world-saver hamil-
ton was first rate but not superior i have read bet-
ter ones the idea of the story was fine but the style
of writing was not up to par even though the all-over
effect was fine

  venus mines inc by zagat and schachner should
hsve been left on venus look these old stories
just cant stack up with modem tale stf may not
have grown inucli during the years but the writing
now is usually better quality stf these days is thriv-
ing on a supplementary diet with the main portion
being better characterization in the old days action
was the main theme

  friends was good though  think the theme could
have been more developed

  travelers tale was very good a slick story if i
ever read one we want whitley

  before i turn to the cover lets get one thing
straight readers are funny people it seems that
wed rather criticize than praise its natural to gripe
at anything even slighuy out of order when the
readers department was inaugurated you really left
yourself wide open

  cover bergey is good no matter how awful he is
look at that guy jumping out after the gal if he
hasnt a fiendish expression on his pan ive never shav-
ed and looking at the girl i can understand his
purposeful leer

  interior pics marchioni was surprising because id
be surprised u he could stay os bod stevens page
 was super to seventeen decimals morey tho just
mediocre is much better than the malicious mar-
chioni moreys page  bettern his page 

  letters i cant comment on olivers missive won-
der why   cant stand poetry of any kind so mister
rose composed for nothing i agree completely with
rick that an original offered for the best letter would
bring in more response and at the same time im-
prove the quality how bout it hass is a hass-been

  grimes gripe about the cover smatta millard
dont you appreciate contemporary art you and
your lams better take it on the lams that is jim
kennedy as youve probably read the cap phooture
epic i think youll revise your opinion veronica
veronica where art thou john cockroft couldnt be
clyde ohio

righter in his praise of kuttner henry is really a
great writer hear me henry brer burgess was
the usual pre-new-leaf baloney with his account of
finding pore lil joke

  the fanzine review was as usual pompetant and i
just cant wait until you critify mine-  george

 somewhere somehow in the above maze
of contradictions we suppose fra jewett is
trying to tell us something-but blessed if
we know what besides whos veronica

panned by paris

by robert k paris

  dear sir just finished looking through the jan-
 issue and i am sorry to say the rag it used to be
a mag is on o slight but very definite downgrade
if indeed it can sink any lower i have seen covers
as bad as this one but they are few and far between

  hamiltons novel-where is cpn future-seems to
be fair but only fair the illustrations for this tale
are very poor

  venus mines ranks highest in this issue with the
pic excellent who drew it

  the other blurbs were good filler but little more

  have there been any capn future stories since
outlaw world

  heres hoping those covers and contents improve-
 spring lake street madiaonville ky

 yes the solar invasion you web-
footed he-goon why dont you learn the
difference between a blurb and a story be-
fore you criticize either one and your
epistolary style which we mercifully edited
to spare our readers the impact of such
quasi-literacy i at least as erratic as
snearys and nowhere near either as funny
or as intelligently constructive as to content

  now crawl back into your half of the pup-
tent ex-corporal paris and let us snore
peacefully in ours

patti saves the day

by patricia j bowling

  dear sir just finished the january issue of
startling stories and had to sit down and drop
you a line everything in the magazine was simply
swell except the pictures please i beg you get some-
one to do your art work besides marchioni his il-
lustrations are positively rank bergey goes a little
wild on the covers but his work is good

  fred ross burgess does swell art work ive seen
some of it and it far surpasses marchioni why not
get him to send some of it in i think you would
approve burgess is very versatile ive also read
some of his stuff and its good

  sarge old pal how about instituting a poetry
section ive read some good verse dealing with the
weird and fantastic and since i like poetry i would
love to see startling stories with such a depart-
ment incidentally you con scan which most of the
poets whose poems have been printed in the letter
section cant do one of these fine days  shall get up
the courage enough to submit one myself

  thanks again sarge for a swell issue i just wish
ss and tws were published weekly instead of bi-
monthly be seeing you-san antonio  texas

  get your courage up patti were wailing
with baited trochee-sounds like an under-
taking shop doesnt it at that more bad
verse gets buried here than in any other stf
mag i think we can say that safely as for
burgess let him come up here and brace the
red-headed and very able terror who reigns
supreme in the art department he not your
browbeaten editor selects illustrators for all
ss and tws stories so how about taking
out a little of your ire on him for a change 
he can take it-we hope
neophyte

by bob gronhart

  dear sir here goes my first attempt at fan writing
so dont feel so bad-it could be worse i hope

  im noi going to kripe or what have you about
the stories authors drawings et al for i dont con-
sider my meager knowledge enough to warrent cn-
tization of men who devote iheir time and energy to
do that special thing

  in addition to that i consider the ether vibrates
not a place to gripe but a place where we can set our
views on ideas furnished to us by the authors through
their stories down on paper and thus let other fans in
on your innermost thoughts it is of no interest to
me if joe kennedy etc like or dislike any individual
story unless-he can present some plausible reason for
it

  as for the foolish controversy over bergey boy
that makes me laugh one glance at his work is
enough to show anyone who knows anything about
the subject of art that he has something on the ball
besides that-what kind of men are they who do not
enjoy looking upon a lovely female such as bergeys
usually are

 well what do you say sarge why not make a
campaign for more deep thinking in the ether vi-
brates instead of the everlasting battle of pro and con

  so till next if any sarge i guess ill act like an
artist and draw this to a close-mi andrews avenue
glen olden pennsylvania

 what does he mean-such as bergeys
usually are    when the mighty earle
draws an unlovely female well throw in the
towel and what does he mean about more
deep thinking in this department we were
not aware that there was any and what is
deep thinking anyway-thinking under water
like a humanoid ball-point fountain-pen-
or what answer us please

huzzahs from lin

by lin carter

  dear sir i did not think il possible for ed hamilton
to equal or surpass his mighty prisoner of mars or
three planeteers but he has done it with the star
of life

  in plot setting and characterizauon the story
shone especially in characterization of thayn she
reminded me in some respects of weinbaums mar-
garet of urbs-

  venus mines inc was one of the few yarns that
really earned its place in the hall of fame excellent
except for the usual comic book-type of nine foot
green-skinned martian villain

  the oilier two shorts were fair friends being
best

  now to the ether wobbles chad oliver as usual
led the parade with a swell letter you and i gree on
marchioni chad tom pace had some excellent views
on merritt and kuttner which i will discuss later an
excellent poem by miss lee budoff and stuff by
grimes and sneary were lor is it uas quite read-
able you can pay me later boys

 shades of buchannon so ray hass doesnt like
guys who criticize stef huh according to him if a
ran doesnt like your stories he shouldnt read the
stufl  well pal if you dont like the letters you
dont have to read them either

  nuff said

 now about pace and kuttner i admit that hank
kuttner is good   good-hes excellent  but 
dont think he can equal abe merritt by sheer poetic
beauty tremendous vocabulary magnificent charac-
terization and plots merritt has outwritten all other

modem fantasy authors he and stapledon love-
craft burroughs taine and a few others are gen-
erally called ihe immortals of scientifantasy

 i do not think hanks work can compare with
tbeirs however there are lesser immortals like



van vogt hamilton heinlein brackett and bond with
whom his work is definitely comparable lets have
more of his work		

  three rousing huzzahs for you sarge on your de-
fense of bergey its become more or less convention-
al to yelp about the covers but bergey does do good
work coloring figures etc the only thing i don t like
is his lack of originality screaming dames and
brawny heroes in red football suits he seenis to have
gotten away from the bems at last good nasty ole
bems-ugh--th ave so st petersburg 
florida

 remember lin we like bems-in fact
we wonder a little about people who dont-
like those unutterably inhibited folk who do
not enjoy bad puns

one for the book-the
text book

by marion eleanor zimmer

  dear sir i suppose it is too late now to get in a
word about the summer issue-but i would like to get
it in anyway for that was my first issue of
startling stories-and now im a confirmed
reader

  to begin-the dark world was the best fantasy
i have ever read and i certainly wish it could be pub-
lished in book form to reach the millions who have a
stupid and bullheaded prejudice against fiction maga-
zines-and also i could have it in a more permanent
form my copy is already half thumbed to death as i
imagine i have read it at least twelve times

  just to prove how much i liked it-well i attend
state teachers college and you can imagine what
a reception stf would find among the bullheaded
people i mentioned above yet i brought up the
dark world in my english literature class as an
example of one of the best novels ive ever read and
the professor had read it too

  as for the rest of the magazine i like ether-
grams and the review of fanzines i also liked the
captain future story in the fall issue when i read
the advance review i was afraid it would be a childish
comic-strlp affair but-surprise it was a really
swell story although not up to the dark world-
but then what could be

  i bought the january issue tonight and as soon as i
finish this letter am going to sit down and read star
of life it looks very good orchids again on the
dark world and lets see it in book form i pre-
dict it would be a best seller-rfd no  east green-
ough new york

 well heck marion what did the litt
teacher think of the dark world to
say nothing of what you thought of the
star of life the laws of chance
and lands of the earthquake
please let us know wont you

 incidentally call him demon the
keith hammond novelet in the fall 
issue of our companion magazine thrill-
ing wonder stories seemed to us and
to most of our more discerning readers very
close to a fantasy classic i you can get hold
of a copy wed appreciate your views on
that one too at any rate write us again if
only to line up with the others swinging
three bats

we guessed it already

by edwin drogin age  in case youd like
to know

  dear sir as lizzy vandersbnoop lightly squeezed
into the airlock she tenderly called throckmorton
 you little weasel where are you instantly our hero
 appeared striding up to her he crooned here i am
 lovey wovey i was -iking my vitamin pill when
 you called theyre awfully hard to get down

    hows that for the beginning of a story we should
 have humorous ones once in a while and  aaaah
 whats that oh the cover of ss had me scared for
 a moment oh well its better than last months i
 dont remember any scene from star of life that
 looked like that

    now i will take ou my handy pocket microscope
 and read the ether vibrations hmm looks like dark
 world received quite an ovation personally i thought
 it was a little too long

    here are my criticisms of the jan ish

     	star nf life-excellent as all your first stories are

    	venus mines incorporated-up to par

    	friends-enjoyed it

    	travelers tale-poor

    here dear old sarge is a poem to keep you busy

    i am deep down in dark despair

    those bems are getting in my hair

    and dear sweet bergey should go sit on a tack
    i bet he hasnt the intelligence to answer back

    so good oid sarge will do it for him

    and let old bergeys conscience gnaw him

    p s i think i better give up writing poems huh-
 -th street brooklyn  new york

   while we thank you edwin for writing
 that-er-letter we really think in poem-
 writing you could do better

mixed grill

 by wilkie conner

    dear sir i am going to try to collect my wits and
 spray a few words around anent i hope anent
 means what i think it means the january startling
 stories

 the new policy seems to be in full swing in the
 letter section and very much for the better too i es-
 pecially enjoy your answers to questions put by read-
 ers that is something all mags should do it as least
 shows appreciation of readers efforts to learn more
 about the inside workings of a magazine

 most of us know very little about the mechanics of
 putting a magazine together so that it will make money

 as well as please a large number of readers and ad-
 vertisers therefore those little back-stage notes
 are more than welcome

 i dont care how the covers or interiors look in a
 magazine-nor who draws them but if a majority of
 the readers seem to dislike bergey as a cover men
 then why not replace him

 its surprising how many people are jusi waking to
 kuttners extraordinary talents i for one recognized
 his greatness way back in   as your back issue
 files of ss and tws will show in my letters of praise
 hank can really sling the ink

 i have refrained from criticizing the fiction in this
 issue because i feel that the other fans will kick the
 poor authors about enough without any added bric-
 a-bac from yours truly some stories are finding print
 in all mags that should be confined to the waste-
 paper collections but why kick a yam after it is in
 print the next story from the same guy might be a
 classic

 but the chances of that story being published would
 be slim if the editor thought that here too was a tar-
 get for reader ammunition right the only person
 who has a real right to condem a yam is the editor-
 and sometimes one would think even editors hate to
 exercise that right personally all i ever got was
 rejection slips maybe the office boy couldnt write  

 on the whole ss is way out front in the field now
 i believe it will remain there-box no  west
 gastonia north carolina

 thanks for the vote of confidence but
 as for removing bergey-horrors the read-
 ers would have no one to gripe at besides
 bergey can and does paint what he is told
 to paint by certain mysterious astral powers
 and does it better than anyone else we
 quite agree on kuttner-next please

that brown mans here again

by guerry campbell brown

deor sir lets consider the january issue of
startling stories ive invented a system for rating
stories this is how it works stories nrc rated n
symbols called nulls a null is like this now in
rating a story you rate it like this a story considered
a classic would be zero nulls an excellent story
would be one null  a good one would be two or
three nulls and so on down the line the lineup for
this issue will be as follows

 cover  bergey can do much better than that
    no relation to the story

 novel  rather corny in spots but pretty original
    plot interesting action

novelet  who picks the hall of fame clas-
    sics anyway not the readersl

shorts friends-

travelers tale- more shorts like this

the ether vibrates  very good keep up the
    good work fellows

 that about winds up this issue of browns squnk
 just one more thing ill admit that raymond hass has
 some good points we need letters like his occasionally
 to balance the silliness-like the above-p o box
  delray beach florida

how true guerry and you rate a whole
basketful of nulls for your missive-espe-
cially for your brain-men-of-venus open-
ing through which an austere blue pencil
was drawn take it easy there will you

             hair of the

    space-pirates oh boy
    theyre my favorite 

oh-oh more
doggerel

by john koehler

 dear sir i am writing in to tell you my thots about
 the last ish following the footsteps of other fanz i
 am going to put in my two-bits worth

 the star of life by hamilton he had some pretty
 good ideas about immortality i would have rather
 read a cf though

 venus mines incorporated by zagat and co pretty
 good but chad oliver might think it was just a space-
 pirate story in dtseuise

 friends by leinster just average

 travelers tale by whitley marvelousl amazing
 stupendous different

 siss-boom-bah slss-bnom-bah earle bergev rah
 rah rah bereey finally got away from his three
 bems bug-eyed monster blue-eyed maiden and big-
 eared mister in the last ish he only used the last two

 the depa-jnenl were good as usual

 now j will write a story about the blue sarge put
 down that blue pencil okay then ill write about
 the green sarge put that down thats better okay
 then ill write a pome

    all bergey gets from all of youse

    is a lot of boos not booze -

    even though he is persistent
    in drawing his eems so consistent

    with dsmex a-creaming
    and monsters teeth gleaming

    but thats the way theyre supposed to be

    if they werent youd be mourning oh gosh oh
    gee

     all an author gets is a great big cheer
     while he types oer a glass of beer

     as he frantically types

     while his plot he ripes

    he smiles with glee
    as the fans wriw whee

                          joy

    bergey sits in his studio and without rest
    draws his bems at his very best-
    so lets stand up and give a cheer

    for bergey instead of author dear

 by the way ye old space-puppy i guess i am one
 of your youngest readers i am only  and i have
 been reading your mags for over two years-s so
 sprague tacoma  wash



  dont try another of those until you are at
least a year older and have lived john

cooking with brass

by michael cook

  dear sir i have just finished reading the january
ish of your magazine it was ihe best in a long time

  and now the stories-the star of life- per cent
this is one of hamiltons best venus mines incorp-
orated- per cent please sarge get a decent h of f
story if you do ill be your friend for life- friends-
 per cent ugh where do you get these
things out of the war surplus travelers tale-
per cent for once a good tlme-travel story hurrah
the cover was good for once bergy stop bulging your
chest youre going to burst your shirt buttons the

inside illls rate as follows

    pages   -very good  per cent
page -not so hot  per cent
page -aacck  per cent
page -fair  per cent
by the way the cover was  per cent
the best letters were  tom pace  lin carter
 millard grimes

  now for a gripe this probably will seem silly but
i raise my voice in earnest prayer-stop leaving the
edges untrimmed- jameson avenue toronto on-

  whats the matter with our edges huh
does anyone else object to them as they are
there will be a short pause while a new
editor is installed in place of this one who
was recently trampled to death by a stam-
pede of untrimmed-edge-maddened fans

  honestly though we dont see why you
care

they get younger and
younger

by michael wigodsky

  dear sir ill start off by telling you that this is the
first time ive ever written to a magazine and im only
years old that et hat out of hc way

  the cover on the january startling was the usual
bergey-that is to say terrible

  inside illustrations

        terrible
 not too had
 terrible
 all right
 good
 wonderful
letters too much doggerel
the star of life almost as good as kuttner
venus mines incorporated i couldnt finish it
however it was interesting to compare it with the new
stories in the mag im agin space pirates im agin
quasi-human natives of other planets im agin every-
thing except kuttner

  friends good

  travelers tale i nominate this story for the hall
of fame story for - evans arc san antonio
texas

  at that michael you write a more intelli-
gent letter than a lot of your elders here
present so the column remains open to
you also to your expert typing and your
opinion on the stories was pretty close to
that of the pros here in the office nice
going keed

a downey red

by john van couvering

  dear six  was really surprised te see the jan 
tsh so soon i guess the new bi-monthly schedule is
hard but pleasing to get used to but it seems to
me you could do better than iwo-issue old letters in
the ether vibrates its a little long to wait eh

    as usual i read tev first so i might as well put
in my two credits worth lessee now   ah heres
oliver give him first no wait theres paces deal  
any more urnph  ummm  ah inst but and how
not least we have burgess  too lets skip it i dunno
whos best	 

  i like your over all format the print and the con-
tents page especially show improvement

  as for the cover leave bergey do his worst which

not seen duplicated anywhere

  you are a horrible poet nuff said

  ah yes the stories thats what you print the mag
for isnt it they seem to be rapidly improving the
whole mag is improving egad sir you would have
us complimenting you if you dont stop this sky-
rocket climb in quality look at me horrible thought

  the stak of glory was about the best ed
hamilton story i have ever read his main charm is
his simple dynamic style no psychological over-
tones the villain is either bad or misguided the
hero is good the heroine is openly mysterious if mys-
terious at all which all adds up to a very readable
story but this time there was more than that con-
gratulations and encouragements ed

  a little unoriginally i say that the h of f classic
was a classic i have heard of that very same story
from several fellows and had been wondering if i
would ever be able to read it thanx sargie ole
sock and semi-serials in the h of f are a swell idea

  friends was excellent murray leinster is a wel-
come addition to the inner circle of tws and ss

  travellers tale was also ultra but wait  
must of missed one someplace  this means some-
thing has definitely happened to ye sarges pet mag  
every story rates an a-l average and the depart-
ments were super as usual  catch me someone im
gonna faint

  wheeee a full-length novel by leinster and does

it look good and here we have a new writer  the
soma racks  the title promises something good
as does the sarge as i said back there the h of f

when planets clashed has to be good doubly
so because mww is the proud papa who knows it
may be a second all-super ish leave marchioni some-
where on pluto and i promise you there wont be a
kick in a carload when you get your letters

  thanks again for the best ss i have ever read-

still had the worst poem in the

the

 fresh smell

 by john r corroll

    dear sir brother apologies to you that  should
 ever use the appellation of sarge with a dear in
 front of itl for two years i was whipped by one then
 i was whipped into one and for three more years i
 was whipped for being one

   for some obscure reason i enjoy your homely hut
 harried humor alliteration accidental many fan
 letters in the ether vibrates would go unread and
 well they might if it were not for the sergeants
 comments

    i read every piece of fantasy fiction that i can find
 but fortunately perhaps my critical faculty extends
 in only one direction my only comment on the stories
 is that some are better than others i am alternately
 amazed and amused to find that various readers feel
 that this one stinks and that one smells etc but
 then i have a very literal imagination when it
 comes to the meanings of words

   the original purpose of this letter sccma to have
 sidetracked itself i intend only to compliment the
 sarge on an unusually fresh approach to some very
 dreary work- mason terrace brook line mama-
 ehasetu

  try em for size in the reader
 speaks in thrilling wonder sto-
 ries same guys same smells same some-
 what fetid chuckles at any rate thanks for
 the pat on the back as well as for at least
 and at last another adult epistle

how does he or she mean it

 by lynn h benham

   dear sir i dont see how he does it-hamilton
 ive just pul aside the january issue of startling and
 to say the least the story pleased me highly world-
 saver seems to always come thru on what the letter-
 hacks call a hack plot seems to have a way of coming
 thru with a well written affair no matter how often he
 drags out the same old plot with small modifications-
 two girts this time

                   what manner of men  are
                                      ler upon
                                      none of



   speaking of girls
 those who bewail the appearance of the former upon
 the covers the only objection i have is that nor
 the breed of the covers ever seem to a wear
  tried to read the letters but have a hard time doing
that while holding my nose the guy from south
bend seems to be jus the opposite takes everything
thats shoved at him aoparently with no exceptions
sounds like somebody that likes to have someone else
do his censoring or him the south shore line
station is only a block and a half from my domicile

  one thing that i cant see is this constant harping
by the readers on the merrilts of fantasy ynurs
truly has read many fantasy stories lovecraft and
merritt among them but sees nothing to go into
ecstasies over at least the fantasy offerings
in ss seem to indicate a flexible policy in regard
to types of stories put on for the reader

  mast of the poetry  sent in leaves me speechless
i say that because profanity isnt used in mixed
company and the mails but theres the exception to
every rule miss buddoff odd name really put in
an amusing one this time and who is hilaire belloc

  in closing id like to know what happened to my
old pal  george ebey i sorta liked the little fel-
ler even ii he didnt agree with my views after all
if he did have my views exactly there wouldnt be any

sundry items-

 dorchester ave chfcacro 

 radio

v television jjj
electronics

place for him and id get rather exasperated when
he would grab onto my female cash my checks drive
my cat fd like to see him do that itd be rather

hard to do seeing as how i dont have any and other
   

from the final paragraph we gather than
lynn this time out is a male not a female
cognomen as for hilaire belloc outside of
being for a couple of generations the literate
spearhead of british catholicism and a lit-
erary running mate of max beerbohm g
k chesterton and all the other greats he
also authored the immortal-

    because if i use leaden ones his hide is

 the moment thereof

he saw star

 by james evans

    dear sir i am not a sclentjfictlon fan and i sel-
 dom read the stuff because it is ordinarily unimagi-
 native and very poorly written

    nevertheless a story appears now and then with
 actual interest and even some literary merit ed-
 mond hamiltons star of life is certainly far above
 the average sf tale its plot is really extraordinarily
 good ill its barest essentials it could stand up to any
 purely fantastic adventure that i have ever read

 its a pity that an author who could conceive such

 an excellent outline of a yam couldnt fill it in more
 intelligently i suppose that kirk hammond was in-
 tended to have only a limited acumen but hamilton
 never makes that fact quite clear and often shows
 him as our olt hero none of the others have any
 character at all and its probably better that way
 another impediment is the sf jargon and the conven-
 tionality of the wars escapes etc

    an author less steeped in the traditions of sf could
 have avoided much of the undesirable matter in the
 story and a more literary-minded writer could have
 improved vastly the characterizauon and the dialogue
 sui most authors could never have written the story
 at all for lack of imagination and i think hamilton
 deserves encomiums pane-gyrics and eulogies galore
 for an exceedingly interesting novel he has the in-
 fallible key to good story writing-romance-iso
 duval st austin texas

   thanks james evans on behalf of ham-
 ilton edmond by romance i take it you
 are speaking of the same wonder that an-
 other correspondent mentioned above we
 are rather inclined to think so it is the
 magic of all great entertainment the extra
 something the merely intelligent and hard-
 working artist can never attain whatever
 it appeals it is the pied pipers tin whistle
 -silver-toned to those caught in its spell

   well that winds us up again we shall
 now go out and try to get unwound before
 we start singing like a top so ions for now

ell the redoubtable ubiquitous
stupendous and even occasionally
dazzling walt dunkelberger of
 fourth avenue south fargo north
dakota really takes over this time as some
of you veteran wallowers in the lush field
of amateur stf magazine frenzy know dunk
did a real job during the late and unlamented
war with his nuz from home

nuz was an amiable gossipy sheet pub-
lished with faithful regularity and aimed at
science fiction fans overseas it hit the target

 dead center now dunk has taken the best
 pages from nuz as well as from his fanews
 and put them into a well bound and very
 thick volume entitled dunks scrap
 book

   it is the biggest thing in fan publication
 since the south bixel street mob put out
 the fancyclopedia he is he says put-
 ting out only fifteen copies lets hope he
 finds the time to double that at least and
 your critic feels highly honored to be on the
 receiving end of one of these rarities

   the book contains such a variety of fan
 delights ranging from pictures of ackerman
 with stephen crane and a pair of starlets
 tigrina please copy to roscoe e wrights
 milepost of destiny that any detailed
 account would eliminate all other reviews
 from this column

   at any rate scrap book is a dilly

   also received this time around is a maga-
 zine new to the pedantic impulses of this
 non-corinthian column although it lists
 itself as volume  number  entitled the
 alchemist published at  ogden

 bound job packed by seasoned contributors
 including roy hunt ackerman tigrina and

  hansen is the man responsible and he
seems determined to make a quarterly issue
of it-at  a whack despite a somewhat
dated editorial on the overrated and definitely
sax rohmerish magic of ancient egypt the
book is well worth the tariff bob petersons
tale anent his own fan travels makes the
best reading in the issue we look forward
to seeing more of same

  having thus disposed of the special an-
nouncements let us now turn to the bus-
iness at hand the crop was average this
time with nine magazines outside of the
above mentioned meritorious pair making
the a list a number of the old standbys up
to and including the acolyte are missing
mores the pity but those accounted for do
not make a list that should cause any honest
fan to feel shame so here goes

  fanews greetings gazette  fourth
avenue south fargo north dakota editor
walter dunkelberger one-shot no fee

  this well-printed oddity rates the a list on both
spirit and proficiency and gails poem twas the
night after xmas make the whole thing as
memorable as a new years day hangover

  a fah swappers delight it lists everything from
ralph rayburn phillips ultra-weird artist to bob

 fantasy commentator  east th
street new york  new york editor dr a
langely searles c per copy  copies 

  perhaps we are becoming a trifle soft or perhaps
familiarity is breeding the reverse of contempt for a
change-ett any rate we find the current issue of this
eminently scholarly fanzine less indigestible than
usuaj and this in aplte of an error on page  which
attributes the serial sale of will murray leinster
jenkins murder of the usa to thrilling
wonder stories the tale in question appeared
elsewhere we found francis laneys piece on time
travel interesiing and most of the book reviews eye-
catching and of course sam moskowitz like old
man time stream rolls on forever with his monu-
mental the immortal storm a history of
stfandom r george medhurst on british fan activities
and george t wetzel on our pet peeve lovecraft is
the name are worthy of attention the latter hit the
nail on the thumb when he described hpls crafts-
manship as painstaking palnsmaklng would be more
like it

  the grotesque  east rd street
brooklyn  new york editor ron christensen
published quarterly c per copy due to rise to
two bits on the next issue

   this issue of groggy seemed to us to be livelier than
ufual- tuckers somewhat scathing comments on the
happlslans of the lasfs were sardonically amusing
and we went a little further left of sanity than usual


trying to solve the burled author puzzle somebody
found a spare in he game and penciled over the total
number of buried literateers-did anyone say they
should all be buried telis streiff apparently has
been slandering the late sarge whoever he was a
base libel which we missed entirely as it appeared
and bob gaulins analysis of so-called fantasy
music was shrewd most of the way the letter section
was excellent and christensens short story held up
far better than most of its ilk all in all a nice job

  rockets  duane street glen ellyn
illinois editor r l farnsworth published
quarterly  per year three years 
does it make sense no

  outside of the ridiculous subscription rate this book
is steadily on the upbeat the new smaller format
makes for easier reading the illustrations and articles
are of much current interest and the ediiors have
discarded the juice or orange peels as rocket fuel in
favor of acid and aniline were still betting it will
be atomic when space travel actually gets here also
contains a piclur o acior john griggs in spectacles
he plays vitamin fiinfheart on the air in you-know-
what and is a long-time pa of your critic also one
of our better performers as is the magazine

  well up lo snuff with tuckers hilarious description
of liebschcrs fabulous post-padscon picnic taking
most of the play after perusing i with many snide
chuckles and guffaws we reminisced non-nostalgic-
ally over certain al fresco occasions in our own un-
happy past and began lo wonder how miserable you
can get anyway there must be a limit somewhere
lets hope the angelinos make this torturesome event
at least annual so that more write-ups can ensue

  stellarte  winship avenue san ansel-
mo california editor john cockroft published
irregularly c per copy

  quite a distinguished job all in all what with such
pros as ed hamilton e hoffman price and the like
contributing however editor cockroft should be
very sure he obtains permission for his reprints from

thus far been unable to match laney eisner tigrina

along with the editor come forward with amusing or
interesting contributions
