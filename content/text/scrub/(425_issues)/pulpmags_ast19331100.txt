beyond the sphinxes

j immy flynn took a last look
through the shaft-house door
the blue sky of greece hung
overhead there were olive trees
and vineyards on a slope stretching
away to eastward mount olympus
the legendary home of the gods
loomed against the skyline to the
north

  greek soldiers lounged about the
entrances to the mine buildings
the gnarled peasant faces of miners
peered in at the mine in which they
had flatly refused to work because
of mysterious things happening far
below ground it was closed by gov-
ernment order now

  blanchard the american manager

of the mine hooked on an automatic
pistol handed another to jimmy
and patted pockets containing choco-
late flashlights extra batteries and
shells

  im ready he said briefly the
mines been closed two days if any-
thing did happen itll happen again
now

  im ready too admitted jimmy

 blanchard picked up a portable
telephone which would unreel its
own wire and slung it over his
shoulder he stepped over to the
shaft and got in the cage jimmy
joined him they dropped like
stones down the long long shaft
the first level echoed the rumble of
cave

by murray

beauty and horror and things of nightmare
shape lay beyond that cave-in the hades of
ancient greece

leinster

the dropping cage the second
the third and fourth the cage
checked its speed it stopped with
a jerk at the fifth level and the air
was damp and chill and filled with
an elusive nauseating odor

 jimmy sniffed testing the air
with mine-wise nostrils blanchard
sniffed likewise and looked grimly
at jimmy

you notice that smell its the
first time ive encountered it but
its what the men described weve
timed this thing right

jimmy nodded grimly blanchard
plugged in the phone and spoke into
it

i smell the peculiar odor that has
been reported we shall investigate
it we are starting now

he adjusted the reel on his shoul-
der jimmy was sniffing more in-
tently the odor though faint
enough was stronger than it had
been and there are distinct classes
of odors even among the scents of
animals a dog has one odor and a
horse another and a mouse and a
red deer can be identified by smell
alone

four thousand feet below the
olive-clad slopes of the olympian
hills with the rugged walls of a

unwinkingly it
gazed at them-
and drew them
back-back-back


astounding stories

mine-drift all about him jimmy
said slowly

  if it werent insane id say that
i smelled a cat of some sort and
at the same time a snake

  blanchard started to move for-
ward the telephone reel made a
twanging sound as it paid out its
wire behind him

  if youre crazy jimmy he said
jerkily youre not alone two men
were heard screaming in the drift
thats ahead of us other men went
racing to them they found blood
on the floor and the cap of one of
the men nothing else except a
musky smell the men had disap-
peared

  i investigated and learned noth-
ing i set a big force of men at
work here and nothing happened
i stayed with them to see two
days later another man vanished
hed worked in this drift with the
regular gang they knocked off for
the day but hed left a tool behind
and he went back for it they heard
him screaming suddenly they
went into babbling panic and it was
fifteen minutes before i heard of it

 i came down again nobody
would come with me i found prac-
tically nothing i stopped work in
this drift and four men vanished
from the level above in five days
their screams were heard that
was all no bodies no traces-noth-
ing they screamed and vanished
the other men quit

  blanchards voice was echoing
hollowly as they moved forward
somewhere far away there was a
slow dripping sound of water falling
drop by drop the lamps flung a
vivid light ahead naked rock
showed just as it had been torn
away by explosives and men noth-
ing else

  but jimmy felt the hair beginning
to rise at the back of his neck there

is no more ghastly sensation in the
world than to be alone in an empty
mine the thousands of feet of rock
overhead seem to press down upon
one the utter loneliness is hor-
rible even when a way of departure
is known but this feeling of hor-
ror was more than that

  dont you think said jimmy in
the echoing silence that its about
time you told me the truth blanch-
ard im here and i smell some-
thing which smells as if it were
alive you said you found prac-
tically nothing which means you
did find something you didnt dare
tell about what did you find
blanchard turned on his flashlight
flung it ahead and turned it off
again he seemed to play it on the
floor

  i found a-a footprint he said
harshly a beasts footprint but
no beast ever known on earth
thats why i brought an automatic
and gave you one if id told you
on the surface youd have thought

me mad perhaps-

 he stopped with a catch of his
breath and listened in the ear-crack-
ing silence the roaring of the
blood in his ears was audible but
there was nothing but the distant

drip-drip-drip of water-

 yes there was the sound of a
stealthy movement but it ceased
and did not come again though
blanchard waited till the breath
burst from him in a gasp

  jimmy said quietly

 you were wise not to say that
in sane sunlight the smell is
stronger now

  i know it said blanchard in a

high strained voice i think-

  he stopped again to listen the
smell grew stronger still it was
almost overpoweringly strong
jimmy said softly

 youve been talking loudly to
beyond the sphinxes cave



draw attention to us now keep
quiet

 he turned off his lamp making
swift certain movements in the
shadow of the wall and there were
other stealthy sounds-which
neither of the men had made-and
the nauseous odor swept forward
like a wave

  and then jimmy flynn saw it

  his automatic came slowly out of
his holster the thing was looking
at blanchard jimmy froze in in-
credulous almost superstitious awe

 suddenly blanchard stiffened
seemingly in every muscle he
flung his head from side to side as
if trying to break some invisible
bond and then he took a stiff step
forward jimmy took an equally
stiff pace with him

  dont look at it gasped blan-
chard dont look its-got me
somehow i-cant draw my gun
i-cant do anything but walk to-
ward it its-like a snake fasci-
nating something

 he took another step forward
get out of here get out while its
holding me with its eyes quick
quick

 his foot lifted and moved for-
ward jimmys foot lifted and
moved forward the thing backed
slowly away drawing them after it
steadily-

  get the shaft guarded panted
blanchard with sweat standing out
on his forehead machine guns
bombs if-if you can shoot it
may take its eyes from me and i can
do something make a noise-

  there was a small crashing sound
the portable telephone he had been
carrying scraped backward over his
shoulder and fell to the floor of the
drift and nothing happened

 blanchard moaned softly he
stepped forward again a straining
battling automaton and jimmy

moved with him walking with stiff
muscles keeping step and keeping
pace they followed the unbeliev-
able thing with stiff mechanical
fascinated steps while waves of a
nauseous effluvium filled blan-
chards nostrils to saturation

ii

 then jimmys automatic
emptied itself with a roar and a
bedlam as of hell let loose began
the shots echoed and reechoed in
the rocky tunnel the ears of the
two men rang and stung and even
after the echoed crashings died
away in the lowest level they could
hear them still booming back and
forth in the rocky galleries of the
rest of the deserted mine

  blanchard staggered on his feet
the thing kicked and writhed leap-
ing madly about then it collapsed
and sounds which seemed almost to
be syllables bubbled out of its
mouth then it was still

  blanchard gagged as he looked at
it then he was throwing a flash-
light all about nothing then he
looked at jimmy who looked like
some weird monster himself in the
gas mask he had put on

 good god said blanchard
shrilly what is it is it-hu-
man

 jimmy looked down at the thing
he had killed and the horrible part
of it was that it did look human
in part the face had a womans
eyes and nose and a womans chin
and a womans throat it was impas-
sively terribly beautiful but the
paws were in no wise human and
there was kinky golden fur all over
its beasts body

 it looks said jimmy in the
voice of one who is inclined to be
sick it looks as if human beings
somewhere or somehow had bred


astounding stories

with beasts and produced this-
sphinx i guess youd call it i
waited to kill it till it had led us
to its hole that smell it gives off
probably stupefies you so it can fas-
cinate you and my gas mask saved
me wait a minute

  his flashlight steadied on a tiny
gap up near the roof of the rocky
tunnel one foot perhaps by a foot
and a half or two it looked like a
shadowy recess where a bit of rock
had fallen down as the tunnel was
cleared actually there was a
steady draft of wind flowing into it
jimmy thrust his flashlight through
and followed with his head he
drew back

  a cave he reported a pas-
sageway anyhow are you satisfied
with the killing of that one thing
your men must have passed through
here though

  well look for their bodies said
blanchard through chattering teeth
and im putting on my gas mask

right now that thing-

  but jimmy was already scram-
bling up blanchard followed at
once the two of them were in an
apparently natural fissure in ancient
rock it was four or four and a half
feet high and probably six feet wide
it seemed to pinch out behind them
but it seemed to enlarge as it went
farther on

  the two of them moved onward
cautiously

  then jimmy seized his compan-
ions hand he snapped off his flash-
light at a pressure of jimmys fin-
gers blanchard snapped off his too
then the darkness seemed to weigh
upon them with the pressure of mil-
lions of tons of rock until jimmy
whispered softly

  over to your right

  there was a faint violet-white
glow visible there they moved to-
ward it with a tremendous stealthi-

ness fifty yards sixty yards

seventy-

 the light seemed to grow
brighter and then jimmy saw its
source crawling he came to an
opening where the passage enlarged
he looked down perhaps a dozen
feet into a nearly circular but ob-
viously natural cavern in the virgin
rock and he saw the light

  it was a steady unwinking flame
burning without a sign of fuel atop
a tripod of golden metal the three
legs of the tripod were elaborately
carved and decorated it was a thing
that looked at once very ancient and
very modern the pattern and deco-
ration of the tripod were archaic

beyond belief but the light-

  good god panted blanchard
men have been here

  jimmy staring intently nodded
with tight lips and suddenly he
pointed to one side of the circular
cave there were rags there blue
denim rags that once had been
clothes worn by a greek peasant
miner there were other things
there too and the recognition of
what those tattered bits of flesh had
been was sickening the floor of
the cave was filth pure and simple

  im going down said jimmy
curtly

  he made his way down the rocky
slope to the filthy floor he moved
forward and then stopped as if shot
he had a diamond ring on his finger
and it was glowing vividly even
when he held up his hand so that
the diamond was in shadow the
stone seemed to glitter as if on fire
he seized blanchards arm and
dragged him back

  what do you hear demanded
blanchard hoarsely

  its what i see said jimmy
that light is death see my dia-
mond x rays make it fluoresce
nothing else will keep away from
beyond the sphinxes cave



that light we need special clothes
for this job

 blanchard opened his mouth to
speak and then pointed speechless
there was a long corridor opening
out of the rounded cave and there
seemed to be some intersection or
crossing passage at the limit of the
light and something was flowing
past that intersection it was alive
it was serpentlike but it was four
feet thick it was spotted and un-
even in color it was monstrous in
size it moved with a horrible quiet-
ness it did not walk it flowed

  the breath left blanchards body
in a wheezing gasp jimmy felt him-
self going pale to the lips the
soundless motion went on unhur-
riedly and then the size of the thing
seemed to lessen as if it was taper-
ing off down to an extremity and
suddenly the end of it-blunted and
rounded no more than a foot in di-
ameter-went smoothly past the
passageway and they could see
nothing at all

  i think said jimmy unsteadily
that that thing whatever it is is a
bit too big for automatic bullets
to handle but i am recalling that
if we go back to the surface and re-
port we will be locked up as luna-
tics we cant go yet

 blanchard pulled himself to-
gether

  im still game he said between
clenched teeth but we could take
back the tripod

  jimmy smiled grimly looking at
the scintillating blazing diamond on
his finger he had seen x-ray burns

  on the whole he said grimly
id prefer being locked up as a
lunatic well explore a bit farther
he brought out his automatic and
held it ready he advanced slowly
and with infinite caution along what
seemed to be the only exit from the
sphinxs den there was only si-

lence the ear-cracking silence of
these abysmal depths blanchard
followed closely they went cau-
tiously to the intersecting passage-
way they stopped there with a
shudder and listened and presently
-greatly daring-blanchard flashed
a light along its length

  but the passage along which the
colossal thing had moved was
curved they could see nothing
jimmy flashed a beam along the
other way something round and
white and still showed up clearly
it was a puff-ball a toadstool some
gigantic fungus growing two feet
high and more

 without a word jimmy moved
toward it the rocky roof rose be-
fore them and suddenly they seemed
no longer confined no longer op-
pressed by an awful weight of stone
above their heads there was a
feeling of open space before them
empty open space there were
toadstools growing and shelf-fungi
and thin many-branching growths
which crumbled as blanchard blun-
dered against one of them

  suddenly jimmy exclaimed under
his breath and snapped off his lights
blanchard followed suit

  for an instant the darkness
seemed absolute then a vague dis-
tant flickering glow swung them
about and as blanchard gasped
in sheer incredulity a crashing
sound began a quarter mile away

  their flashlight beams shot out
a human voice called desperately
the crashing kept up it was grow-
ing nearer the voice called more
desperately still it was a womans
voice hunted and terrified and cry-
ing out for aid and then a figure
leaped into view and it was white
and human and in awful terror-
stricken flight straight for them

 jimmy flung forward though
blanchard was not a second behind


astounding stories

him flash beams boring into the
murky darkness all about they
plunged through clouds of dust from
exploding fungi in the instant un-
reasoning response of their kind to
the outcry of a woman in danger or
fright

  and the flashing white body fled
toward them and something leaped
from behind-something shaggy and
horned-and brought it to earth
and a voice growled throatily and
something came furiously toward
them-and jimmy and blanchard
were pouring lead into a creature
seven feet tall that was bounding
upon them

 their beams lighted up shaggy
furry hide their guns crashed
again and again and the thing
bleated and staggered and crashed
to the ground

 its a damn good thing said
jimmy composedly that the local
forms of life arent especially tena-
cious of it this girl knew we were
humans by our lights evidently
watch that thing blanchard

 he bent down over the slender
figure on the ground flung there by
the creature they had killed jimmy
looked and made an exclamation in
a choked voice he switched off his
lights swiftly gradually he became
aware that the distant flickering
glow produced a constant shadow-
less twilight all about and then he
heard blanchards teeth chattering

  blanchards flashlight was playing
on the head of the thing they had
shot and this thing looked human
too it had a hooked aquiline nose
it had eyes that must have had a
human look not long since it had
a manlike beard though its mouth
was more horribly sensual than any
mans could ever be but there were
two horns springing from its fore-
head and its body was covered with
shaggy fur and as blanchards hands

shook the flashlight beam wavered
along the monstrous body and the
legs ended in delicately formed
cloven hoofs

  god cried blanchard in a shak-
ing voice what is this thing
what is this place weve come to

 jimmy spoke with an unnatural
composure from where he cradled
a slim figure in his arms with shade-
less twilight all about

  youve heard of it often enough
its described at length in the greek
legends you learned in school two
men have gotten back from it-
heracles and orpheus im begin-
ning to understand things were
somewhere under the mountains that
were supposed to be the homes of
the gods and of course theres only
one place we can possibly be were
in hell

iii

 the old greeks he added
called it hades it seems to be
real

 a winged thing fluttered over-
head monstrous in size it could not
be seen too clearly in the shadeless
twilight but jimmy sent a beam
from his flash toward it he drew
in his breath at what the beam dis-
closed the flying thing fled in
panic

  think said jimmy that first
creature we killed in the mine
looked part human maybe it was
we back-trailed it to its lair and
found a light there which was full
of x rays and ultra-violets and god
knows what else its like no light
on earth above and it would kill us
if we were exposed to it but it didnt
harm that sphinx i call it a sphinx
because it had a womans face and a
beasts body and it used its eyes to
fascinate like a snake then we
came out here and killed another
thing and it matches up with the
beyond the sphinxes cave



natural history of the old greek
legends it would be a satyr ac-
cording to the old descriptions so
you see-

  blanchard snapped off his lights
and the twilight seemed to become
more noticeable and somehow more
horrible

  ive-ive gone mad said blan-
chard thickly thats it

  no said jimmy i think were
both likely to wind up lunatics but
im holding fast to my explanation
those rays from that tripod would
burn our flesh in quantities in
lesser quantities they might cause
cancer or they might-

 he swallowed theyve used
x rays on fruit flies blanchard x
rays do something to any organized
cell tissue they stimulate it but
nobody can foretell how on fruit
flies when theyre too weak either
to sterilize or kill them they pro-
duce freaks x rays make fruit flies
lay eggs that hatch out monstrosi-
ties creatures without wings or
too many without legs or with
multitudes of them with two

heads and three and four- do

you see

  blanchards breath seemed to stop

 you mean-

 suppose said jimmy that a
long time ago there were people liv-
ing in a cave like this suppose that
there were radiations in the soil in
the rocks caused by the stuff that
makes that tripod light glow sup-
pose the people didnt die but that
those radiations affected them as
x rays affect fruit flies theyd pro-
duce monstrosities some of the
monsters would die some of them
would live-perhaps insane and
they might mate with animals and
the same unholy radiations which
stimulate all cell tissue in unpre-
dictable fashions might even make
those offspring of monsters and

beasts fertile and capable of pro-
ducing other monstrosities more

horrible still-

  blanchard muttered thickly in the
shadeless twilight amid the huge
fungus things and staring down at
the shaggy body of the half human
creature he had killed only minutes
since

 suppose that in ancient days
there was some communication with
the upper air said jimmy and
that some of those ghastly things
went upward and were seen by men
four thousand years ago three
thousand years ago what would
half-savage folk like the ancient
greeks believe

  blanchard said hoarsely

 theyd think-they saw gods
theyd make legends of them
said jimmy theyd make tales of
sphinxes and satyrs and-what was
that thing that flew away when the
light struck it

 it had a womans head said
blanchard shivering

 theyd probably call that a
harpy said jimmy blanchard
this-thing that looks like a girl is
coming back to consciousness i
saw her face its beautiful as i
never thought a woman could be
beautiful and-im frightened
there was silence blanchard
fixed his eyes upon the slender white
shape that lay in jimmys arms his
eyes were growing accustomed to
the twilight now he bent down

 shes human he said slowly
shes human but jimmy i never
saw a woman like that

  it was jimmys teeth that chat-
tered now

 i looked at her he said un-
steadily in the light and i-im
in love with her from that one
glimpse and im remembering that
besides satyrs and harpies and
sphinxes which can be killed there
 

astounding stories

are legends of nymphs and vam-
pires and-and sirens blanchard
they killed the men who loved
them and-and-what is this girl
in my arms

 there was no answer the twi-
light had not lightened in the least
but the slim white figure took
clearer and ever clearer form as
their eyes grew more accustomed to
it and the sheer beauty of the girl
was breath-taking there were san-
dals on her feet which seemed to be
made of brass somehow fashioned
to be flexible there had been a
fillet about her head to confine her
glorious dark hair the remnant of
some thin garment-ripped and
shredded in a heart-rending strug-
gle-only partly concealed the firm
young flesh beneath it was held
to her body by a belt of brazen or
golden plates in which there was
an empty dagger sheath

  she stirred and sighed faintly
and jimmys heart pounded uncon-
trollably and then she opened her
eyes

  blanchard was bent down staring
fascinated at the almost unearthly
beauty of her features her eyes
fixed upon his goggled gas-masked
features and then she gasped in
horror and her hand went groping
toward the pathetically empty
sheath at her waist

  in a flash jimmy had his own gas
mask off and caught her arm in a
reassuring grasp her eyes flick-
ered to him and then she clung to
him gasping out an unintelligible
sentence

  jimmy stood up and he was aware
of a strange sense of absurdity in
that he was laughing softly he
showed the girl his mask put it on
took it off put it on again

  take off your mask blanchard
he ordered his voice shaking from
his relief she thinks youre a

monster too shes human blan-
chard thank god shes just as we
are

  blanchard obeyed

  the girl was staring at him in-
credulously she went close with
a swift lithe movement she
touched his face with her fingers
and suddenly an excited smile
flashed across her face and she burst
into happy thrilled speech there
was but one word that jimmy
caught and that only because it was
repeated-theophori she clasped
one of blanchards hands and one
of jimmys and stood between them
with her eyes shining looking from
one to the other with her breast
heaving in inexplicable delight

  jimmy spoke

  blanchard the first thing for us
to do is to get her to some place of
safety and then try to find out how
to talk to her

  back to the mine then said
blanchard to our own world

  but the girl shivered suddenly
staring off into the twilight she
released one of her hands to point
and something was coming out of
the tunnel from which the two men
had emerged into this monster cav-
ern they saw a long neck with an
impossible head coming out of the
living rock they saw a second
head emerge then a third and
then a single body

  it came out for ten feet for fif-
teen for twenty it was not walk-
ing it flowed the body was four
feet thick and taller than that it
was spotted and uneven in color
it moved with a horrible quietness
and gradually its movement slowed
and stopped its three heads
writhed and twisted gazing about
gradually it became still a horrible
parody of an earth creature sunning
itself part in and partly out of its
den
beyond the sphinxes cave

  but the light in which it luxuri-
ated was a horrible gray twilight
that seemed never to alter or change
the way of return to the mine at
least was blocked

iv

  if we can kill it said jimmy
grimly if we can kill it its body
fills up the tunnel and thats the
only way we know back to our
world we cant move a thing that
size well have to wait till it goes
away

  but the girl tugged at them she
pointed behind her she spoke
eagerly jimmy listened in a queer
hopelessness not of life but of com-
prehension but he caught a word
then he caught another and sud-
denly he said urgently

  blanchard listen to what shes
saying its greek ancient ar-
chaic greek together we may pick
out her meaning

  they listened with feverish in-
tensity they knew modern greek
as a matter of course but modern
greek is not the language of the age
of pericles and the words this girl
was using were of more archaic
structure still

  she stopped looking eagerly at
the two of them and jimmy spoke
quietly

  guessing at half of it he ob-
served she says were waited for
by all the theophori they must be
her people and if we can dodge
the-some kind of monster i cant
guess at because i only caught the
word for thunder-shell take us to



them she was to be given to the
monsters weve saved her he
paused what say

  blanchard looked back at the cave
mouth from which they had
emerged and at the unthinkable
creature sunning itself in the hor-
rible gray twilight something
stirred a long way off it took to
wing suddenly and fluttered away in
the heavy dead silence that seemed
to hang here always

  well mark our way said blan-
chard and go

  they nodded to the girl she
laughed softly to herself and
bounded forward the floor of the
mighty cavern dipped downward
here and they moved forward with
their lights turned on full if there
were monstrous things that sighted
them they drew back from the spots
of electric flame

  and then as the floor of the cav-
ern dropped away they saw its vast-
ness more clearly it was colossal
it must have been miles across

  vast stalagmitic columns seemed
to support the roof here and there
but far far away they saw the ori-
gin of the persistent twilight there
was one place where a quite impos-
sible sunlight seemed to shine

  sunlight no because it flickered
and wavered constantly but a
bright glowing golden light never-
theless and where that bright light
was brightest there was an uprising
of the rocky floor as if to provide
a site for a vast acropolis and the
acropolis was built there

  they saw structures made as if of
gold gleaming and glittering in the

astounding stories

flickering light there were walls
and battlements and terraces the
girl pointed to them and shivered
speaking in a frightened voice
blanchard stared blankly

  unless im crazy he said un-
easily she says that theres where
the gods live

  jimmy nodded

  it would be he observed yes
decidedly it would be

  and just then quite suddenly
from the tip of the topmost battle-
ment a streak of flame burst out
with the speed of lightning it
flashed in a jagged dart to a spot be-
low and far from the battlements
base flame flashed where it struck
and seconds after there was the
crashing roll of indubitable thun-
der

  zeus said jimmy calmly has
flung a thunderbolt at somebody
poor devil

  the girl was shivering but she
caught at his arm and nodded
zeus she repeated zeus
and then her face blanched and
she clung desperately to jimmy and
buried her face as if from a sight
too horrible to be borne

  because no more than thirty feet
away a man was standing looking
at them he had a shining golden
helmet on his head and he carried
a brazen shield on his arm and he
wore a hoplites sword and the
brazen greaves of ancient sculpture
he was smiling but the smile was
so derisive and so malignant and so
utterly cruel that jimmys lips
twisted into an answering snarl

  leisurely the man brought his
hand from behind his shield he
held up a bit of golden sculpture
it was a face a womans face a
thing of pure horror with serpents
writhed about it

  the gorgon gasped blanchard
ive seen-

  but he never finished the sculp-
tured eyes seemed to flash jimmy
felt a sensation of agonizing cold
and then he felt his muscles stiff-
ened in the terrific rigor of cata-
lepsy the girl froze to stone in his
arms blanchard toppled like a
carved image his limbs inflexible
and jimmy-braced by the girls
body-stood erect with all the hor-
rors of death because he was utterly
unable to move a muscle even his
eyes were fixed and staring though
he was conscious of every sensation

  he heard a laugh derisive and
mocking and inhumanly cruel then
a female voice spoke the voice
was soft and seductive and luring
-and it was horrible he saw some-
thing which was female but not
wholly human it moved about
him the man spoke in the same
archaic greek the girl in jimmys
arms had used jimmy translated the
words in his own mind

  garden of the gods-comedy of
agonies-hes one of the gods damn
him and hes going to take us to
their damned city-

  then he felt a net being cast about
him he remained frozen motion-
less the same net infolded the girl
in his arms it tightened suddenly
and he felt himself lifted upward
blanchard bumped against him for
an instant their eyes-fixed and star-
ing-looked into each others then
the net soared upward from the
earth and jimmy was tumbled to
the bottom of it

  whatever carried them flew but
flew low never more than forty or
fifty feet up there were times when
the net soared upward from the
growth below but presently the
light grew stronger and sickly
vegetation appeared freakish and
monstrous like all else in this in-
credible region

  and then the golden light became
beyond the sphinxes cave



stronger still and jimmys whole
frame became filled with an awful
anguish he realized that it was the
power of motion returning to him
slowly sweating blood in his agony
he became able to move one arm
then the other he heard blan-
chard moan softly and then there
was a tiny sobbing sound from the
girl as of a cry wrenched from be-
hind tightly clenched teeth

  then with a sudden exquisite
painfulness the entire power of mo-
tion returned to jimmy he strug-
gled in the net wet with the sweat
of agony seconds later blanchard
was able to move the net was of
chains woven so thread-thin that
they cut into the flesh that pressed
against them but strong as steel

  ill shoot the thing thats carry-
ing us- panted jimmy ill-

ill shoot-

  but blanchard gasped a negative
pointing down and whatever it
was that was carrying them was ris-
ing higher they were a hundred
feet up two hundred golden
metal walls glittered beneath them
they had a vision of battlements
coated with metal and then of green
things growing below and of ponds
and lakes and elaborately land-
scaped gardens

  and then the walls soared upward
again and there was what seemed
to be a terrace of marble or ivory
and a confusion of moving brightly
colored people and they dipped
down and dropped the last ten feet
with a sickening jerk it seemed de-
liberate

  blanchard was fighting the net
savagely when jimmy staggered up-
right its meshes gave now and
suddenly they were free blanchard
was cursing bitterly under his
breath but jimmy felt some one
clutching at his legs and bent down
and lifted the girl to her feet he

felt her quivering in terror as she
shrank close to him

 then jimmy saw the man who
had laughed at them and pointed the
golden gorgons head at them he
was flying standing in what
seemed to be a strap slung from his
shield he held it aloft above his
head and went slanting downward to
the marble pavement in a clean glide
exactly as if that shield were the
thing which supported him in the
air he landed lightly touched
something at the back of his shield
and lowered it and slung it carelessly
over his shoulder as he walked
laughing toward the brightly clad
folk who reclined or moved lan-
guidly about a glitter of gold and
jewels

  jimmys voice was cold and hard

  were here blanchard whether
we like it or not i imagine that
since this is the place where the
gods live it may be considered
heaven incidentally these people
have a civilization away ahead of
ours in some respects that gor-
gons head must be a sort of ray
projector that shoots out a paralyz-
ing ray well want to shoot that
chap first understand

 im crazy said blanchard in
thick-voiced rage i know im
crazy but im going to get him
ready

 the girl was speaking in their
ears she was utterly deathly
white she was filled with that ul-
timate horror which is past mere
terror but she spoke to them she
put one arm about blanchards
shoulder and patted him gratefully
she pressed close to jimmy looking
with wide horror-filled eyes at the
group of languid and gayly col-
ored people at the farther end of
this space of marble and suddenly
she looked up at jimmy and kissed
him quite simply and trustfully and


astounding stories

then stood with her hand clutching
one of his tightly with the pitiful
erectness of one who waits for
death she faced the leisurely fig-
ures to whom their captor spoke
amusedly

  she said these are the gods and
we die said blanchard hoarsely
do we open fire jimmy

 just a minute said jimmy
coldly theyll probably say some-
thing but remember to shoot at
the chap with the gorgons head
first we owe him something we
owe him a lot

  heads began to turn toward them
and these people were fashioned
wholly like the humanity of upper
earth but there was no trace of hu-
manity in their regard of the three
figures brought captive to their
midst they looked at the three ab-
stractedly boredly indifferently
not as if they were servants or
slaves not even as if they were ani-
mals but as if jimmy and blan-
chard and the slim young half-
nude girl between them were some
unimportant form of vermin to be
exterminated because they might
possibly be annoying

 one of them spoke in an ab-
stracted incredible indifference
jimmy-little as he had heard of
this archaic speech-understood the
order it was a bored indifferent
direction that the girl be given to
the monsters and the two men killed
their captor reached behind his
shield the gorgons head came
out again

v

 jimmys automatic crashed
the man with the gorgons head
spun around and dropped red
blood poured out upon the speckless
white pavement but even before
the crash of his targets brazen hel-
met on the floor jimmy was plung-

ing forward and blanchard with
him

  the brightly clothed men and
women seemed utterly frozen but
their immobility was not that of fear
or terror it was that of incredulous
amazement it was the sort of blank
astonishment that would overcome
a hunter if a rabbit opened fire upon
him with a machine gun

  jimmy had the gorgons head
blanchard was beside him his auto-
matic ready and menacing

  shoot the first one that moves
snarled jimmy while i find how
this damned thing works

  he was fumbling with the golden
horror in his hand the snaky locks
of hair formed a handle but that
was all it was hard to imagine the
thing as a weapon because men of
the earths surface make all tools
and instruments with a strict prac-
ticality there is no play of fancy
in the construction of technical de-
vices surface men use rubber and
steel and glass and metals without
ornaments these folk had turned
a paralyzing-ray projector into a
work of art

  a tall man well over six feet
stood up with a glowing robe drap-
ing itself magnificently about him
pure wrath untainted by fear or any
other emotion gave him an aspect
of terrible menace his voice
boomed out-and was cut short by
the crackling of blanchards gun
the girl cried out triumphantly
jimmy fumbling desperately with
the sculptured thing in his hand
caught her meaning she was cry-
ing to the gods that their day was
done their rule ended because the
deliverers of the theophori had
come

  then one of the snaky locks of
the gorgons head shifted beneath
jimmys finger he felt rather than
knew that the sculptured eyes had
beyond the sphinxes cave



flashed the mob of cold-eyed hu-
man beings froze where they stood
became utterly rigid in the fearsome
stiffness of catalepsy

  a fat man purple-faced from rage
and the wine that poured from an
upset pitcher at his feet was caught
in the act of a vast hiccup a
woman beautiful in a fashion purely
physical was frozen in the act of
reaching to a tiny thing at her waist
that seemed no more deadly than a
box for cosmetics a man with a
face like apollo frowning had half
drawn his sword-and there was the
hissing of flame from its scabbard
and the brazen sheath smoked sud-
denly and glowed and melted

  in every conceivable attitude the
brightly colored people were still

  they had been feasting languidly
great bowls of fruit and confections
were interspersed with flagons of
fragrant sparkling drink but they
were motionless now

  but there came a beastly scrab-
bling and conglomeration of noises
a horde of things came pouring out
upon the terrace on which the rigid
gods had feasted some of the
things were hopping weirdly and
some of them ran on two legs or
four or six and some of them
writhed forward but there was
none that was not monstrous not
one that was not in some fashion or
in some degree human and none that
did not seem to have come from the
most hideous of nightmares

  a feathered thing screeched and
ran forward on human feet some-
thing else with innumerable heads
of which one was that of a human
idiot came writhing forward upon
the stumps of innumerable legs
and there was the counterpart of
that sphinx with its hypnotic eyes
and impassive countenance that
they had killed in the mine

  jimmy held out the golden gor-

gons head with an almost hysterical
feeling that he was impersonating
perseus of ancient legend and that
he was not dressed for the part the
things froze as the gorgons eyes
flashed and he looked at them and
was sick to his very soul

  good god he said thickly
blanchard these are the guards of
the gods lets get out of here

  but the girl touched his hand
smiling a white-faced little smile
she spoke carefully now because
she had come to realize that it was
hard for him to understand her
and jimmy looked deeply into her
eyes and they glowed softly in re-
turn but she fought away all
thoughts of anything but the one
thing that seemed most important of
all possible things to her

  she wants to get to her people
said blanchard to end the reign of
the gods forever

 jimmy asked a question he
phrased it carefully the girl
nodded and explained watching to
make sure he understood what she
was saying

  these were the monsters said
jimmy in a purring fury and the
damned things we killed were mon-
sters to whom she was thrown the
theophori-this girls people-are
the descendants of the slaves and
children turned over to the gods in
ancient days they are raided for
women now either for playthings
for the gods or for the monsters
she was turned over for that pur-
pose the monsters are the guards
of the gods and the subjects of the
gods and some of them are doubt-
less the children of the gods the
chap who had this gorgons head
was visiting something with a wom-
ans head-but not a womans body
blanchard weve got to wipe this
business out

  well need machine guns said


astounding stories

blanchard thickly and poison gas
and-

  but there was a sudden hiss and
crackle a thing exploded luridly
just past jimmys shoulder a hu-
man figure in a bright-colored robe
darted through a doorway and out
of sight

  theyre coming to snarled
blanchard

  jimmy held up the gorgons head
again and shifted the movable
snaky lock with a queer feeling of
inadequacy it made no noise and
gave no sign that it had operated
blanchard had his gun ready

  jimmy moved grimly forward the
other two with him one of the
gods was alive and moving he
would have weapons which they
could only guess at though jimmy
remembered a thunderbolt he had
seen flung from the topmost battle-
ment of this same structure re-
membering that he raced ahead he
heard a clatter as of brazen sandals
upon steps before him he fired a
shot or so at the sound the roar of
the weapon would be strange to the
fugitive and by the same token as
alarming as the gods weapons to the
surface men the brazen sandals
redoubled their speed and jimmy
leaped up the stairs three at a time

 as he passed them he had
glimpses of hallways of impossible
luxury of incredible richness of un-
paralleled artistry but the brazen
sandals fled ever before him he fol-
lowed and blanchard and the girl
toiled desperately after him even
jimmy began to pant for breath be-
fore he saw his quarry toiling up a
high stairway yet above him and
fired again and heard a thin scream
then the fugitive dived through a
doorway and seconds later jimmy
was plunging in after him

  he saw monstrous sculptures and
shields and swords and he saw a

balcony beyond the room and on it
a movement and dashed there also
and the fugitive was in mid-air
yards away standing in a strap sus-
pended from a brazen shield which
he held over his head

  he was flying and it seemed some-
how that the shield was a repellent
of gravity and in some fashion a fly-
ing device vast as the cavern was
there would be no winds to make
complicated controls necessary

 but now the flying man turned
about in mid-air he drew his
sword and flame flashed from it and
draperies beside jimmy smoked and
caught fire luridly but jimmys au-
tomatic barked again and the flying
man crumpled and dropped from the
strap in which he stood and the
shield flew upward in a sudden in-
sane swoop and turned over in mid-
flight and dashed itself to frag-
ments against a battlement half a
mile away

 thats that said jimmy with
grim satisfaction

  but he glanced downward and his
blood ran cold

  the brightly colored figures of
the humanlike gods were stirring
they fled to cover the monsters
also writhed or ran or hopped out
of sight in obedience to orders from
a man in a golden robe who ran be-
fore them to lead them and then a
tumult began all through the huge
golden structure of the acropolis

vi

 i think said jimmy grimly
that were probably finished but
weve got the gorgons head any-
how and well fight it out

  blanchard pointed to the wall
a duplicate of the gorgons head
hung there there were several
and there were swords such as
jimmy had seen flash flame at him

            ast-
beyond the sphinxes cave



and one of which he had seen melt
its own scabbard when its wearer
was stricken with cataleptic rigidity
with the weapon only half drawn
and there were shields jimmy
gave a shout of satisfaction

  were in the armory he roared
the armory of the gods

  he thrust a gorgons head upon
blanchard and upon the girl ex-
plaining swiftly how they worked
upon each of them there was a mov-
able lock of the snaky hair he
eyed the shields hungrily

 guard the entrances with the
heads he commanded while i look
at these shields theyve got con-
trols somewhere

  he dragged a shield from its peg
and inspected the back in desperate
haste again the luxuriant decora-
tion the overelaborate ornamenta-
tion with amazing cleverness the
controls were made to seem a part
of the relief-design only but pres-
ently he had found them he ex-
perimented recklessly then unslung
a coiled strap of hide stood in it
and felt himself lift from the floor

  we can fly now he panted joy-
ously hows it coming

  blanchards gun roared a pen-
cil of white-hot flame coming
through the door wavered up to the
ceiling loosened a fitted stone and
died away

 theyve got something-

panted blanchard and stopped

  because the world had gone sud-
denly utterly dark cries came up
from below but they were cries of
rage then the light came on again
the same flickering light that shone
perpetually in this colossal cavern
and jimmy stared at a fire-black-
ened stone which had been loosened
by a pencil of flame and had dropped
from the ceiling upon one of the
horrible statues in this room it
was bumping down to the floor now

  ast-

jimmy saw the arm of the smitten
statue moving stiffly back into place
the statue was that of a man hold-
ing a torch aloft to give him light so
that he could look down smiling
horribly at the sculptured things
about his feet

 something clicked in jimmys
brain he began to see the foulness
of the folk who formed even their
technical machinery with controls
shaped into obscenities and he
seized the torch-bearing arm and
pulled on it

  again darkness fell utter and ab-
solute and when he released the
arm and light sprang again into be-
ing jimmy cried out in triumph
but blanchard gasped

  theyve got something that neu-
tralizes the gorgons head im
having to shoot-

 jimmy seized a sword from the
wall he flung off its sheath and
instantly instead of a thrusting
point a pencil of consuming heat
leaped from its tip

  all set snapped jimmy these
will hold the door for us its a
heat ray of some sort

  he put down the sword where its
beam of heat would rake the open-
ing he jerked loose another sword
and another half a dozen of the
weapons filled the doorway with an
unbearable heat

 now listen panted jimmy
we can fly with these shields ill
show you how and these gods
make the light for this world and
ive found out how to turn it off
well send this girl to her people
armed with the gorgon heads be-
cause those devils downstairs have
heat rays well send her off in dark-
ness well give her a chance to get
a long way away turn on the light
again-so that she can land-and
take off ourselves in more darkness
sooner or later these devils will


astounding stories

have the light going again then
we can land but anyway we have
our flashlights and well arrange
to-

  the girl cried out something
winged and horrible was landing on
the balcony a sword-ray cut it in
half its shriek brought more cries
of rage from below the room was
beginning to fill with the reek of
scorched stone and burning dra-
peries

  guard the balcony with a sword
panted jimmy

  he caught at the girls shoulder
pandemonium was rising from be-
low the outcries of monsters arose
as if they were being herded to an
attack from which they shrank
jimmy showed the girl with a vast
aching tenderness just how to oper-
ate the shield and told her fum-
blingly and painfully just what she
was to do go to her people show
them the shield and the gorgon
heads they would be weapons for
the future he and blanchard would
fight off the raging gods below un-
til she was safe she must fly fast
and far while the darkness held
then she must alight he and blan-
chard would escape in a second
darkness when the light came on
yet again she must make her way to
her people very carefully and very
cautiously using the heads for de-
fense

  she interrupted with a question
hopeless tears in her eyes jimmy
hesitated then he spoke firmly
and suddenly she melted into his
arms and kissed him passionately

  blanchard was gray-faced as she
stood on the balcony the shield
held above her head half a dozen
of the sculptured faces of horror
caught in her belt slender and
young and beautiful with the
bravest and most wistful of smiles
for them she stood waiting

 jimmy pulled down the torch of
the beastly image which smiled upon
horrors at its feet the world went
dark and she was gone

 there was utter blackness save
where the sword-rays poured out the
doorway there the very air glowed
blue-white and the structure of the
building itself was crumbling un-
der the heat of the rays but into
that incandescent air a monster
came shrieking

 its face was a horror itself
blended of a dozen races of crea-
tures it seemed to explode in the
furnacelike heat that poured out of
the armory of the gods and then
there was another and another-

  furred and feathered and scaled
with wings and paws and fins and
mere shapeless lumps of flesh for
limbs the monsters were driven to
destruction from below they
reached the focus of the sword-rays
they died to an accompaniment of
bedlamlike howls and shriekings
and they produced a reek of vola-
tilized flesh that was nauseating
was horrible was overpowering-

 jimmy released the sculptured
torch and the world outside sprang
into light he saw a tiny glittering
point of light very far away indeed
his heart leaped as he watched
it slanted downward hovered and
vanished among the incredible forms
of vegetation of this underground
world

  shes safe he roared to blan-
chard above the hideous uproar of
the dying things shell get her
people theyll meet us where we
first met her get a shield well
fasten down the light control and
start

 blanchard obeyed and jimmy
pointed out the controls of the fly-
ing device and shouted an explana-
tion of their use above the scream-
ings of the burning monsters he
beyond the sphinxes cave



slung a sword-ray about himself and
took a gorgons head which he
found fitted neatly into an ingenious
clamp in the sculptured back of the
shield he fastened down the torch
of the light-controlling figure
again the only illumination in the
world was the flames of the sword-
rays

  jimmy and blanchard retreated to
the balcony outside it seemed to
jimmy now as if the force of the
sword-rays was dying out as if the
substances that created them were
being exhausted the monsters
were still flinging themselves into
the flames one thing with many
heads thrust one long neck into the
armory itself then a sword-ray
burned the neck through the
nearly human head writhed and
gasped and flopped crazily about the
room at the end of the serpentine
neck

 and jimmy and blanchard took
off together in the blackness each
holding to an end of a strip of
charred hanging there was no dan-
ger of their losing each other in the
blackness and jimmy had oriented
himself before leaping from the bal-
conys marble balustrade they
flew and flew and flew until there
was only deep silence about them
and they began to fear that they
would dash into the caverns roof or
rocky wall

  wed better stop said blanchard
in a shaken voice

  well land said jimmy

 they settled slowly together
and suddenly there was light all
about them no more than a quarter
mile away they saw the mouth of
the cavern from which they had
emerged into this monstrous world
the three-headed thing no longer
sunned itself in the perpetual shade-
less twilight

  fly there asked blanchard

 jimmy nodded-and regretted it
bitterly afterward because they
rose no more than forty or fifty feet
and soared toward the tunnel and
then from the high-walled acropo-
lis beneath the golden light there
came an instantaneous jagged flash-
ing flame pure lightning streaked
past them a fireball of electric force
it smashed against the farther wall
of the cave and exploded luridly
an instant later there was another
the pungent smell of ozone was al-
most overpowering the second
thunderbolt missed them only by
feet

  in blind panic they darted for the
cave mouth they bolted into the
rocky passage forced to abandon
their shields by the need for haste
and outside they heard the terrific
impacts of thunderbolt after thun-
derbolt it seemed as if electric
fluid dripped down the very rocks
as if it would pour into the passage
after them

  racing jimmy flashed on his flash
it showed a monstrous head before
him something was flowing toward
him with amazing quietness he cut
at it with the sword-ray blan-
chard joined him they wiped off
its heads and baked the fore part of
its body and it continued to flow to-
ward them as if its nervous organi-
zation were too low for the hind part
of the body to know the fore part
was killed would it never stop
never

  the passage gasped blanchard

  the thing was still flowing for-
ward in seconds more it would
close the way to the upper world-
and thunderbolts flamed and crashed
behind them they flung their
swords into the thing and them-
selves into the side way and saw
the unwinking blue-white glow of
the light in the sphinxs cave again
before them-


astounding stories

  itll be days said jimmy un-
easily before the theophori can
come to meet us and meanwhile the
gods will be hunting us and we
can get some bombs and machine
guns and maybe some greek troops
well go up and come back with re-
enforcements

  on the farther side of the sphinxs
cave blanchard set down the gor-
gons head he carried he fastened
the movable snaky lock so that the
eyes continued to flash

  rear guard he explained
grimly

  they went on at last they
dropped into the drift of the fifth
level of the mine there was only
a heap of putrescence where the
body of the sphinx had been it
was gruesomely phosphorescent

  funny said jimmy in an un-
natural levity that-that thing
seems almost chummy compared to
some of the rest

  he and blanchard laughed hys-
terically they were uncontrollable
when they reached the bottom of the
mine shaft and it was a long time
before they could make any one an-
swer them from the surface but
as they were hauled up the thou-
sands of feet to the surface they
calmed and began to realize what
their story would be

  they flashed into the beautiful
blessed sunlight whiskered greek
peasant miners stared at them hope-
fully a mustachioed greek officer
beamed at them he smelled pro-
saically of wine and garlic

  you found nothing he asked
placidly it is too bad-

  jimmy and blanchard stared at
each other in this world of sun-
light and olive groves and vine-
yards of garlic and sausages and
newspapers and politicians there
were also insane asylums and they
suddenly realized that they had no
evidence the flying shields they
had abandoned as they fled from the
lightning bolts below the swords
they had flung desperately into the
flowing body of the thing that
barred their way jimmy had a
gorgons head but he was suddenly
resolute in his determination not to
display it he would need it when
he and blanchard went down again

  no said jimmy unsteadily we
didnt find a thing-

  and suddenly the ground shook
and rippled beneath their feet an
earth shock a temblor of strictly
local occurrence which did not
cause any damage or any disturbance
on the earth above

  but it was odd in one way the
rock at the bottom of the mine was
crushed and broken as if a terrific
explosion had taken place far be-
low not only the fifth level but
the fourth and third were utterly
closed by shifting implacable rock

  and jimmy went gray when he
realized what had happened he
was thinking of a girl who spoke
an archaic ancient form of the
greek language and who was beau-
tiful and who had kissed him trust-
fully and who-if the gods did not
manage to interfere-had expected
to meet him shortly just beyond the
sphinxes cave in the dim perpetual
shadeless twilight of hades

ghost

  by stuart jackson

music such as the world had never
heard poured from the piano-for he
played to something not of this world

i am telling the story of
chalapinski the pianist because
it seems there was a time when
he would never have played again
had it not been for a ghost

  to you who listen enraptured by
his playing whenever opportunity
presents itself the thought of music
without chalapinski would seem like
an orchestra without instruments
for it has been said of him that he

interprets the musical masters better
than they wrote their own music

  how you would miss the flourish
of that proud dark head-the sight
of those broad shoulders and the
flash of the long white hands that
crash out chords to stir the soul

 women have loved chalapinski
and not for his music and fame
alone but chalapinski has loved
but one woman men knowing no


astounding stories

better have hinted at fleshly in-
trigues-pointing out as though the
fact were any criterion of baser
abandonment that the man has no
wife

 but i know chalapinski better
than most men and better than all
women save one for it is my privi-
lege to call him friend perhaps
that is why he told me of the lovely
ghost

  you see somehow or other we had
got on to talking about spiritualism
and from there my conversation had
degenerated into the so-called mys-
teries of what are generally known
as ghosts

  unpleasant things to have about
the house said i even if i believed
in them horrible apparitions who
chill the bones on dark nights in
creepy corridors

  not every ghost is like that
said chalapinski quietly

  have you ever seen a ghost i
asked

 chalapinski looked at me in a
peculiar way and there was the sug-
gestion of a mystic something in his
eyes then he murmured

  this one was a very lovely ghost

indeed-

  he did not speak again for several
minutes and i smoked one of his
turkish cigarettes in silence-for i
could see that he was reviewing a
mental procession of the years
suddenly he said to me

  listen my friend-and i will tell
you the story of a musician who only
found fame because of a very lovely
ghost

 now chalapinski is a man of
imagination whose conversation
carries a literary touch so i shall
give his story as he told it to me

  that story starts began chala-
pinski in the days when nobody
asked the musician for his auto-
graph world tours packed con-

certs in every european center the
plaudits of england and america
were but a wild dream of fame he
had yet to be discovered you see

 perhaps it was because he was
lonely and ready to put a romantic
halo around the head of some girl
who might notice him that he mar-
ried young-too young

 he married a young woman in
budapest she was a strange crea-
ture as he soon found-and to his
temperament a dangerous one she
had a sadistic streak in her mental
make-up

  there were terrible scenes and
wild incidents ugly in the extreme
the climax came when by careless-
ness she killed the child that had
been born to them

 all this was undermining his
music as you will understand
music my friend is the poetry of
the soul and if that which is ugly
takes seed in the soul then poetry
is choked

 when he realized this thing
after blinding himself to it for some
time the struggling musician-that
is the expression is it not-knew
that he must leave the woman who
was his wife

  she would not divorce him for
his action in leaving her prompted
her sadistic nature to prevent him
making a happier marriage she
herself found solace in the atten-
tions of a wealthy greek-but she
was careful not to provide any ad-
missable evidence that would give
her husband his chance of freedom

  and so she passes from the story
though her influence had still to be
erased from the mind of that strug-
gling musician he left budapest
and played his way in the small
cafes and restaurants from city to
city which in later years were to
pay high prices to hear his music

 he was unutterably lonely and
the lovely ghost



sick at heart the emotional nature
which may mean so much to a musi-
cian was seared and raw cast-iron
men who can pursue their steel-
bound ambitions untroubled by any
such consideration might have
scorned his sensitiveness but per-
haps you will allow that the man
who makes music is necessarily of
different caliber from the man who
manufactures-let us say-pneu-
matic drills

 and it was when that musician
was at his most despondent that he
met chrystel

  you will have heard the plati-
tude that standing behind all really
great men is some one woman and
such a woman was very necessary
to this man who more mature now
was better able to assess that which
was worthy in a woman he had
lost sight of beauty and chrystel
could bring it back all that was
best in him could be brought out by
a love that was given without reser-
vation

  i want you to think of the dawn
for chrystel was fair as the day
and of eyes that were sea-green and
of clustered curls kissed by the sun
too lyrical you think ah my
friend but this love was lyrical
chrystel was very lovely

 she brought sunshine to him
after shadow-the lilt of laughter
and devotion as deep as the ocean
she brought him passion-and
peace foreign blood she had in-
herited fired the former and yet
she was sufficiently saxon to give
him the balance his intense nature
needed

  she loved his music because it
was part of him and knowing his
need of her she left her world and
came to him and in case you my
friend are of a philistine turn of
mind-which i doubt-i would tell
you that no legal or ecclesiastical

ritual could have forged a stronger
or more mutual bond those two
were mated you understand

  their flat was only modestly fur-
nished but it was home for chrys-
tel had made it so she gave it
touches of color and dainty cur-
tains-and a few flowers

  she nursed the musician when he
was sick and darned his socks and
sang while she washed up the
dishes and did other things domes-
tic she sold what little jewelry
she had brought with her to help
him buy a piano by uneasy install-
ments breathed words of encourage-
ment when recognition still seemed
so elusive and at night she lay pas-
sionately close in his arms return-
ing caress for caress and whisper-
ing in a language made for love
je taime-je taime avec tous mon
coeur

  do you dispute that their love
was lyrical my friend with such
a woman behind him what else
could he be but inspired

  and his love of her found its way
from his soul to his finger tips so
that there was passion and tender-
ness depth and delicacy grace and
grandeur in his playing-for
through chrystel he had learned the
loveliness of life

  the inspiration that was appar-
ent in his playing did not pass un-
noticed it attracted the attention
of the people who matter he be-
gan to get engagements for the res-
taurants of the rich and from more
exclusive circles than the cheap
continental cafes where his music
had been lost in the clatter of
crockery

 so the time came when what is
known as society bade him hand his
hat to the butler and a very illus-
trious hostess set the seal of ap-
proval on his playing and it was
known among the cognescenti that


astounding stories

it wqs but a step across the way
from the salon of that illustrious
hostess to the hall of fame-other-
wise my friend monarchy hall
which as you know prides itself on
offering the finest music in the
world to discriminating audiences
paying a high price to hear it

 can you imagine their mutual
joy when one magical day the mu-
sician conveyed to chrystel the
news that he was to play in a few
weeks time at the monarchy hall
no i do not think that even you
can imagine the full ecstasy of that
day

  a successful debut at the mon-
archy hall means so much just
how much you yourself whose busi-
ness it has been to weigh the talents
of new discoveries in the balance
will know

  and chrystels first thought was
that a potential celebrity should be
in a state to give of his best so that
he might duly become celebrated
she suggested a brief holiday by
the sea before her musician gave
himself up to the arduous rehearsals
preparatory to his debut

  so they went away together and
for a whole week chrystel would
not permit him to touch a piano
they just lazed in the sun and
laughed in the surf and wandered
in the lanes of the little villages
pushed back from the sea at the foot
of grape-bloom hills

  life was very sweet so sweet
that fate found them sharing a hap-
piness that made irony envious

  happy though that holiday was
they had no regrets when they took
the train for home there seemed
so much to look forward to

  the wheels of the train sang of
a triumph to be as they rushed
through the night if the whine of
the whistle was like a wail of warn-
ing they did not heed it

  and it was while they were hold-
ing hands so happily that there came
an appalling crash then the train
rocked and slithered to a sickening
silence-a silence that was shattered
by the sound of ghastly cries while
flames sprang into the hideous
night

 perhaps you remember that
dreadful railway disaster when a
holiday train came into collision
with an express when twenty-
seven people were killed outright
and many burned and badly injured

 chrystel and the musician-
what of them they had been
traveling in a forward compartment
the musician remembers shrieking
her name as the compartment
crushed in like a trodden match box
around them he remembers grop-
ing blindly for her in a tangle of
tortured steel and writhing wood-
work while thick smoke choked his
lungs that is all he remembers-
then he does not remember how
helpers got him out from that hell
without his limbs being maimed
hopelessly

 but chrystel-oh my god-
chrystels lovely little body was
broken and torn and terribly twisted
and crushed-

 she was taken to the cottage
hospital of the wayside market town
the outskirts of which had been the
scene of the crash the musician
insisted on going along with her
though they told him he was in no
condition to do so

  some semblance of life still beat
in her but he knew that there was
no hope for his beloved the sur-
geons told him that she would lin-
ger a few weeks at most and then
she must die

  for hours the man who loved her
sat at her bedside waiting for her
to give him some sign of sensibility
can you imagine his agony of mind
the lovely ghost



he had sat in the sun-and now all

was darkness

  it was two weeks before he felt
chrystels hand stray weakly into
his own your music- she mur-
mured faintly

   no matter he told her and his
voice was broken

   but it does matter dearest-so
much she whispered it means
everything to you-your debut at
the monarchy hall-

  oh my sweet he cried how
could i bear the thought of even
trying to play while you were lying
here like this

   it is what i would wish you to
do she told him gently you have
fought so hard for this chance and
we both have hoped and gone
through so much for it your
triumph will be mine-always you
must be ready to give your best on
that great night and i shall be with
you oh my dear-we have been
so much to each other that always i
shall be with you 

 chalapinski paused at this
point in his story and i noticed that
the hand with which he swept the
raven hair from off his fine brow
was shaking slightly presently he
continued

  so i-for it will have been ob-
vious that that musician was myself
-flung myself into rehearsals in the
tortured days that followed
heaven knows how-but it was
what she wished

  and at last there came the night
of my debut at the monarchy hall
strange my friend how the hour
that one may have anticipated for
years may seem so hollow when it
comes

  i was to play at nine thirty the
place was packed musical triumph
was in my reach incredible that
the monarchy hall had been at-

tained at last but how bitterly
my thoughts were elsewhere-in a
country cottage hospital where the
woman i loved so well fluttered be-
tween life and death the ordeal
before me was doubly difficult as
you will presently see

 before leaving chrystel that
day she had asked me not to get
in touch with the hospital until my
recital was over i will be with
you she told me again

  but the suspense was unbearable
half an hour before i was due to
make my debut i put a call
through to the hospital

   i must know how she is i said
feverishly

 and they told me that she was
dead

  chalapinski most famous of pi-
anists paused again and the room
in which i talked with him was very
silent then his deep voice tremu-
lous in tone he went on

 the inward agony of that mo-
ment is with me still though time
mutes most minor keys i was be-
side myself with grief my dark-
ness had deepened i just stood by
that telephone while a procession of
minutes passed it was as though
a part of me had died with her to
face the ordeal of playing before a
sea of staring faces seemed impos-
sible

 then it was when my agony of
spirit had touched the depths that
there came to me some strange
strength for i was suddenly aware
that chrystel stood by my side i
was as certain of it as i am of you
here now

  they came to me and told me it
was time for me to go and face the
audience even as they did so i
knew that chrystel was still with
me that she was telling me to go
out to triumph

  so i went out before that critical


astounding stories

audience at the critical moment of
my life and sat down before the
great grand piano whose heavy lid
had been raised high as though in
anticipation of what i might wring
from its bosom

 and i played ah my friend-
but how i played that night i
played of life and of the mysticism
of a love that knew no death and
of infinite ecstasy in contrast with
deep despair for chrystel was there
to guide my hands i heard her tell-
ing me that i had learned a lifes
lesson out of pain for only out of
pain can come creation and my
music that night was creative

 then i came to the end of it
and rose from my seat there was
a moments silence then a crescendo
of applause came swelling up to my
ears out of that great hall yes ap-
plause that told me i had triumphed
but where was the pride i had al-
ways imagined would be mine in this
moment

  the plaudits were loud-but they
sounded empty to me i tell you
that a part of me had been left
standing stricken at that telephone
half an hour before i played

 i stood up and half turned to
take my bow with my right hand
resting on the inside of that grand
piano above which the massive lid
was raised

 and even as i was bowing be-
musedly to the vast applauding au-
dience my right hand suddenly did

a strange thing it was jerked to
my side-not of my own volition
but by some curious force outside
my control

 a split second later and the
massive lid of the piano fell with a
terrific crash had my hand still
been resting where it had been a
moment before it would have been
smashed to pulp-and i would never
have played again

 once more chalapinski paused
and i-my trade has made me skep-
tical-said

 possibly a contraction of the
muscles of the arm after an inten-
sive spell of playing

  i tell you came the instant re-
ply that the lovely ghost of chrys-
tel was with me that night

  and did you see her i put in
i know she was there said
chalapinski

  but have you ever seen a ghost
i persisted and as for the piano
incident-surely since you say you
were only half turned to the audi-
ence you saw for yourself that the
lid was falling

  then it was that chalapinski gave
me his denouement

 i have never seen a ghost my
friend certainly not the host of
chrystel how could i i said that
the railway disaster had not maimed
my limbs-but shock had tempo-
rarily taken its toll on me

  no i could not see the ghost of
chrystel you see i was-blind

leitfried

the long trek across
three quarters of the globe
ended at lower manhattan
as bruce lanyard felt himself
caught up in the maelstrom of city
din he wished he was back in the
valley of the gods surrounded by
the majestic himalayas tibet was
never more real to him than at this
moment

  brown lean hardened by scorch-
ing suns and blasting winters lan-
yard felt suddenly out of place in
the melting pot of civilization why
had he come back

  his fingers felt for the letter that
had followed him for nearly a year
before it was opened by his restive
fingers and having opened it he
had abandoned everything by pack

train by camel by endless miles of
long marches he had set his face to-
ward civilization lost in the won-
der of a womans words that bade
him come to her

  he stood after a few minutes just
inside the portieres of doctor asa
cadmores library half expectant
half fearful at the expected shock
of seeing her face again

 the doctor-inventor raised his
eyes as the adventurer entered
weary eyes they were eyes that
were saddened by a great sorrow
they brightened at sight of the lean
figure

  bruce a thin cry of pleasure
the old man was on his unsteady
feet arms outstretched

 lanyard clasped both of the
chemical-stained hands its good
to see you again doctor his eyes
strayed toward an adjoining room
where was ishtar ishtar whose
words had called him from the in-
terior of asia ishtar whose let-
ter had been over a year in reaching
him his eyes betrayed the question
to the girls father

  cadmore motioned him to a chair
sit down bruce there is much
to tell you and im afraid it isnt
going to be pleasant

  lanyard sat down his eyes set
beneath the arch of his forehead
stared questioningly into those of
the older man

  ishtar intoned the doctor-in-
ventor with a faint catch to his
voice is no longer with me
dead breathed lanyard

  no not dead ishtar is alive
very much alive but-but not on
this old earth of ours bruce shes
on a far planet out into space
renewed fear clutched at the
heart of bruce lanyard only
faintly did his mind sense the star-
tling import of asa cadmores
words he said slowly

  tell me all about it im-im in
the dark

  two years ago began the doc-
tor-inventor i stumbled quite by
accident on a method of reducing
solid substances into light waves
naturally i became excited and a
little fearful i told nobody except
ishtar together we worked i
developed new prisms everything
went beyond my wildest hopes

  he paused it was then that ish-
tar told me that she had written you
we both wanted you with us for the
first great experiment no word
from you i became nervous it
was essential to try the new prisms
i had my own way in the matter
ishtar of her own free will prom-
ised to be the subject for the ex-
periment

  a grayish paleness stole over the
adventurers face as he listened to
the older man

  i projected her body out into the
wasteland of star space announced
the inventor straight into the ad-
vanced civilization of a far planet
and she lived during her trip
through the elements bruce ishtar
is there now waiting for me to bring
her back

  and you cant lanyards eyes
widened with fear you cant
bring her back doctor

  ill-ill need your help

  ill do anything you say

  i knew you would now listen
when my rays carried ishtar to this
far planet i intended to bring her
back to earth at once but bruce
the people on this planet have a ray
-a ray of impenetrable blackness
they turned it on it struck the
rays from my own machine my
rays couldnt pierce it the black
beam acted as a powerful reflector
my own rays were turned back on
the prisms and the heat generated
cracked them
prisms of space



  then the same thing is likely to
happen again

  yes

  and if it does

  i have two prisms in reserve its
taken over a year to have them made
and if anything happens this time

- he shook his head slowly

  well cross that bridge when we
get to it snapped lanyard

 cadmore seemed to brighten
good my boy but come ill
show you the machine at once
lanyard vaguely uneasy followed
the doctor-inventor to the third floor
of the house

  the door leading into the labora-
tory opened bruce looked around
half-finished machines lined the
room on all sides but bruce had
no interest in them his eyes were
fastened on a glittering structure
of highly polished metal

asa cadmore pointed to his
machine with some pride there
it is bruce-the space conqueror
lanyard stepped closer how
does it work

  vibration of matter-disintegra-
tion what i have done is to reduce
matter into light waves and project
them outward into space through
special prisms

 lanyard eyed the machine curi-
ously there were two prisms aqua-
marine in tint each suspended longi-
tudinally between two posts of some
highly polished metal their faces
were roughly three feet in length
and half that in width an insulated
platform was erected beyond them
so that a person standing upon it
would be directly in the path of
the ray passing through the prisms

  beside the platform stood a black
cabinet similar to a transformer
high-tension wires coiled from the
cabinet to a heavy switch set against
the wall

  come over to the control table
bruce

 lanyard crossed to where the
older man stood

 this announced cadmore is
the heart of the machine i not only
control the rays from here but i
also see the rays after they have
passed through the prisms

  the inventor turned back the cloth
covering the table directly in its
center rested a square of metal
screen farther back on the table
were twelve vacuum tubes of un-
familiar design to the left was a
large dial almost the size of a din-
ner plate with a vernier set in its
center close to it were three
switches with colored handles

  a final inspection of terminals
and the doctor-inventor closed the
master switch came a sputtering
crack and an arc light glowed
whitely against the prisms on the
control table the vacuum tubes
glowed dully and the metal screen
glowed with the clearness of a pol-
ished mirror

 gradually this gave way to a
faint mistiness lanyard gasped
squarely in its center floated a turb-
ulent mass of clouds that cleared up
almost at once presently a dark
speck shot into his field of vision
growing in size with each fractional
part of a second it seemed to rush
toward the screen with the speed of
a meteor

 our common everyday moon
observed cadmore well be with-
in a few miles of it in a very short
time

 the dark speck expanded as it
flowed into the metal screen fin-
ally it covered the screen altogether
in a twisting mass that became stead-
ily brighter soon mountains and
valleys loomed up pitted with deep
craters and when it seemed that
the moon itself would crash into


astounding stories

the screen cadmore pulled back on
a lever controlling the angle of the
prisms

 the light beam from the prisms
slanted into space a second dark
speck mirrored itself in the screen
closer it came with incredible swift-
ness until its mass covered the re-
flecting screen the outlines of
mountains and hills expanded with
such swiftness that lanyard became
dizzy from watching

  this is the planet announced
cadmore studying the reflection
intently but were on the wrong
side of it we must curve the rays
to the other side

 but were seeing this planet
through the medium of strong
prisms objected lanyard im not
a scientist but i do know that in
spite of their strength your prisms
cannot reveal what lies beyond the
horizon

  doctor cadmore smiled tolerant-
ly did you ever hear of triple re-
fraction

  lanyard shook his head

  well its the inherent quality of
my prisms to deflect a ray of light
in an arc of a hundred and eighty
degrees which makes it possible for
the rays of this machine to curve
around the horizon watch

  he pulled a lever somewhere be-
neath a table a motor hummed the
farthest prism tilted ever so slight-
ly but it was enough as lanyards
eyes returned to the metal screen
he saw the wild mountainous re-
gions of the planet drop downward
and in their place appear roads
buildings and civilization a city
flowed into the screen flashing with
color that defied description above
it hovering like silver insects were
strange ships of the air unlike any
ever seen on earth-airships with-
out wings bullet-shaped in design
but we want the palace said the

inventor it should be over to the
right there it is see those four
minarets covered with what looks
like pure gold a little more to the
right a twist on the prism control
ah heres an open space very
likely the place where well find ish-
tar if shes still alive

 lanyard stared in mute wonder
on the screen showed a wide ex-
panse of luxuriant courtyard the
foliage seemed an unnatural color

  why is it he asked that na-
ture has departed from green in its
grass and trees

 nature is the same all over
bruce its the fault of the prisms
he turned to the control table
and continued observe carefully
bruce these two switches with the
colored handles control the vacuum
tubes on the control table they
must be kept switched on at all times
during the experiment this end
one controls the light-filter cells
housed underneath the table

  hold on a minute doctor in-
terrupted lanyard i havent the
faintest conception of what this ma-
chine can or cannot do

  ill explain all thats necessary
bruce just do as i direct

  of course

  now when i step onto the plat-
form for the outward projection

through space i want-

  wait a second cut in lanyard
this is not clear at all if anyone
steps out on that platform im going
to be the one

 but listen bruce-

  lanyard shrugged ive made up
my mind youre going to project
my body to the planet now ex-
plain just what takes place doctor
so ill be more or less prepared
doctor cadmore placed his fingers
on a large dial close to the metal
screen this dial he began is
the controlling force of the tung-
prisms of space



sten wires strung above the plat-
form below them is an electro-
magnetic field perhaps four feet
square you will notice that the top
of the platform is covered with
quartz crystal it is the only sub-
stance i have found that will not
respond to the disintegrating in-
fluence of the vibrating tungsten
wires following the change of mat-
ter into light waves the beam from
the arc passes through my special
lenses and the light in turn is
flashed out into space

 hm-m-m grunted lanyard
well is there any reason why we
shouldnt make the attempt to lo-
cate ishtar now

 doctor cadmore wiped his damp
forehead none that i know of i
would have preferred to make the
dangerous trip myself but as you
say perhaps it is better that i re-
main at the controls

  lanyard tried to keep his voice
steady he was used to danger-but
being transported bodily to an un-
known planet was beyond his imag-
ination he fought down fear and
spoke calmly im ready now
cadmore nodded ill do every-
thing i can to protect you bruce
wherever you go your body will
show plainly on the metal screen
it may take time but ill do my best
to keep you in sight with the rays
keep out of buildings as much as
possible and now good luck
after a fervent handshake the ad-
venturer stepped on the crystal plat-
form midway between the metal up-
rights holding the prisms calmly
he waited

  ready asked the inventor
  ready

 blue sparks jumped from the
master switch as contact was made
almost at once lanyard felt a surge
of cold air envelope his body from

somewhere in the laboratory came a
strange sound like rushing winds
he felt the crystal platform vibrate
beneath his feet to his ears came a
steady humming mounting higher
and higher in pitch the tungsten
wires above his head sang a wild
continuous note that sirened far
above the rushing roar of the wind

  cadmore turned to the instrument
table pressed two knobs and re-
leased two others the vibration
rate of the tungsten wires in-
creased higher and higher mounted
the humming paean of their throb-
bing

 a cloudy mist gathered before
lanyards eyes his body seemed en-
shrouded in fog he attempted to
turn his head but it remained im-
movable he struggled to twist his
eyes they too were held fast by
the invisible power emanating from
the electrical forces pouring through
his body

  things began to blur slowly the
glittering posts supporting the
prism in front of him took on the
same mistlike quality as the body of
doctor cadmore only one thing
remained constant in his line of
vision-a beam of greenish light
that seemed to glow around the cen-
ter of the prism

  quite suddenly the world turned
black he felt himself jerked from
the platform and hurled through
space he had a vivid sensation of
falling as one does in a dream al-
ternately he shivered with cold and
baked in unbearable heat yet all
the time he felt space fleeing before
him

  a feeling of exhilaration caused
his body to tingle strangely as
though some enlivening force had
taken possession of him he felt up-
lifted and strong space around him
glowed with flashing iridescent
lights


astounding stories

 with startling abruptness his
flight through space ended he felt
himself being pressed against an in-
visible barrier and held there the
iridescent lights paled shadows
danced before his eyes a lethargy
crept over him he began to feel
heavy the shadows darkened and
became a wall of stone against which
his body pressed

  out of thin air his body began to
materialize his mind groped for
several minutes for an explanation
of the phenomenon then he re-
alized that the matter that composed
his body was undergoing a rapid
change from light waves to solid
substance the rays from cadmores
twin prisms had come to rest
against a solid stone wall he was
totally off the earth and materializ-
ing in his worldly body on a strange
planet

 he saw the shadowy outlines of
his hands and feet appear out of
thin air abruptly gravity acted up-
on his body and he dropped from
the face of the wall to the ground

  for several minutes following his
arrival on the planet the vibratory
rate of the tungsten wires throbbed
in the air around him suddenly this
sound ceased as if someone had
thrown the switch from the dynamo
controlling it

 had lanyard seen the agonized
look that flowed across doctor cad-
mores face on the instant the metal
screen went blank from the failure
of the prisms he might have had
grave cause for alarm

 as it was he remained unaware
of the catastrophe the black ray
wherever it came from had shot into
the path of the light streaming out
from the prisms and before cad-
more could lift a hand the prism
had cracked from the intense heat
generated from the reflection of its
own rays until that prism could

be replaced the inventor was help-
less to aid either his daughter or the
man he had projected into space to
find her

 lanyard of course knew noth-
ing of all this his thoughts at that
precise moment were centered whol-
ly on two beings standing beside
him and regarding him with puzzled
eyes

 tall men they were well over
six feet with skins of coppery
bronze green bands of metal en-
circled their foreheads keeping long
hair away from their faces and
they were beardless they wore a
sort of a leather doublet studded
with metal and carried knives

  conscious of their close scrutiny
lanyard smiled and attempted to be
friendly but the strange beings
remained stonily indifferent one
of them pointed toward a stone
structure some distance away and
spoke unintelligible words as he
started toward it

  understanding their wishes lan-
yard followed behind them the
leader of the two entered a door
where a ramp slanted beneath a
building through cavernous pas-
sages they made their way in utter
silence

  they came after a time to a metal-
studded door over which burned a
bluish light a guttural word from
one of them and it opened lan-
yard found himself in a guard room
a number of men similar to his
guides lounged upon benches they
jumped to their feet at sight of him
a blond-haired giant strode for-
ward

  z aw hoi tsa

 lanyard shook his head he
didnt understand

 they talked among themselves
evidently undecided as to what to
do with this strange being who had

           ast-
prisms of space



appeared on their planet after
much jabbering one of the men was

dispatched for some one more
learned than the rest

  he returned after a considerable
time and with him came a white-
haired patriarch in a long flowing
robe he too examined lanyards
clothing and muttered meaningless
phrases he seemed pleased a
holy reverential light illuminated
his bronzed face his body quivered
with eagerness he touched lan-
yard lightly on the arm and mo-
tioned him to follow

  theyre friendly at any rate
thought lanyard as he kept pace
with the elderly man

  they left the passage after a time
and crossed a bridge over a stream
of muddy water the place was
heavily guarded but the guards
were alvrays respectful of the elderly
being

  upon entering another building
lanyard became instantly aware of a
different class of people these
were better dressed they were
clothed in what looked like silk
and linen garments gathered at one
shoulder and terminating at the
knees a few of them were orna-
mented with bracelets of beaten
gold and all wore sandals prob-
ably these were the aristocrats

  they reached the far end of the
room a pungent odor filled the air
lanyard sniffed questioningly iodo-
form or a similar compound he
thought an attendant met them
here and guided them through an
arched doorway

  the sight that met bruce lan-
yards eyes caused his blood to run
cold under the glare of white
lights he saw a line of operating
tables planet beings were strapped
to them each undergoing some form
of vivisection while he hesitated
at the doorway strong arms encir-

  ast-

cled his body and strapped him to a
vacant table

  the white-haired patriarch spoke
to one of the attendants a table
with antiseptics and surgical in-
struments was wheeled close sev-
eral of the planet surgeons turned
their cases over to assistants and
gathered around the table to which
bruce was strapped

  a second table was wheeled from
an adjoining room by twisting his
neck lanyard could see the head
and shoulders of a very old man
a cloth of gold covered the lower
part of his body

  what did they mean to do 

  carefully the planet surgeons be-
gan to measure with instruments
that closely resembled calipers the
necks and shoulders of both lan-
yard and the old man on the adjoin-
ing table presently the patriarch
conveyed by sign language the hor-
rible operation

  the old man was their ruler his
body was close to death only by
surgery could they give him a new
body they would accomplish it by
transferring the body of this white
godlike creature to the head of their
king

 lanyard tried to protest
frantically he struggled against the
straps that held him to the operat-
ing table the horrible purpose of
their surgery caused a cold sweat
all over his body

 something cracked overhead a
stream of light blazed down from
the ceiling one of the planet sur-
geons marked the spot on his neck
where the head was to be separated
from the trunk

  a similar preparation was taking
place at the adjoining table lan-
yard watched in spite of the horror
in his heart the flashing strokes of
a glowing scalpel-saw deft fingers


astounding stories

attach suctionlike ends of flexible
tubing to what appeared to be a
heart machine which drained all
blood from the parts exposed by de-
capitation

  the planet surgeons left the other
operating table and approached the
one whereon lay the earth man and
as lanyard sucked in a strangled
breath the surgeon with the glowing
scalpel was suddenly bending over
him

  lanyard closed his eyes guttural
voices rasped his ears something
cold and clammy touched his throat
his eyes snapped open it was then
that he saw the suctionlike ends of
the tubes they were being made
ready to fasten upon his arteries
like so many leaches

  the tortured man could feel the
planet surgeons breath against his
face the glowing scalpel edged
closer fingers slid over the ex-
posed throat and while the earth
man fought against a growing in-
sanity through the walls of the room

pulsed a humming sound-louder

and still louder

  a cloudy mist gathered before
lanyards eyes the figure of the
planet surgeon became enveloped
in cloudy vapor the humming
mounted through the lower regis-
ter of sound and climbed in pitch
till the human ear could no longer
hear it

  the walls of the room became
tinged with greenish light lan-
yard felt his body vibrate as it had
in cadmores laboratory as before
the world went suddenly black he
was jerked from the table room and
all

  again the queer sensation of being
hurled through an eternity of space

  then the light began to pale
shadowy images clouded his vision
bright posts of metal glinted
through the fog his body grew

heavy and with heaviness came an
extreme lassitude of his entire be-
ing

 the worried face of cadmore
swam before his eyes he tried to
smile felt the blood drain from his
head and collapsed weakly upon the
crystal platform

 something stung his throat
he opened his eyes the doctor was
forcing brandy down his throat the
warm stimulant restored his numbed
senses

  you got me just in time doctor
  feeling better

  lanyard sat up ashamed of his
weakness im all right a close
call wasnt pleasant what hap-
pened to the machine

  one of the prisms cracked the
dark ray they flashed it on how-
ever i installed one of the two re-
serve prisms in time

  how did you know where i was
i didnt know not being able to
trace you in the open i turned the
rays on all the buildings within a
radius of a mile from where you
landed

  had you not reached me when
you did doctor my body at this mo-
ment might have been joined to the
head of an old old man and his
body would have replaced mine an
unpleasant prospect i think i aged
ten years in ten minutes

  impossible breathed cadmore

why youd bleed to death-

  lanyard shook his head no
doctor i saw them decapitate the
head of another man they at-
tached a mechanical heart that took
care of every drop of blood no
those surgeons knew what they were
doing

  shall we abandon the project
for to-day bruce you look worn
out

  for reply the adventurer once
prisms of space



more stepped onto the crystal plat-
form im ready he announced
lets go but set me down in a
different spot this time

  once more rushing winds poured
from the black boxes the plat-
form began to vibrate slowly the
interior of the laboratory faded
away then the black void of space
again the mists lifted

  in one breath-taking moment
lanyard found his body materializ-
ing a second time close to one of the
main highways of travel on the far
planet

  and back in the laboratory on
earth doctor cadmore stared with
distended eyes at a narrow band of
blackness arching across the screen
with a sudden twist of the dials he
shifted the angle of the rays so as to
avoid it the black ray arched back
again once more cadmore avoided
it in sudden dismay he noted that
his own rays were no longer on the
spot where he had left lanyard

  sweat beaded the inventors fore-
head at any moment the two rays
might come into collision again
how could he avoid it and yet keep
lanyard in sight

  he wiped his moistened forehead
and tried to think of a method to
counteract the menace of the dark
ray from the planet laboratory
there was but one prism left in re-
serve if it should break-

  he half rose to his feet and as he
did so the mysterious ray of black-
ness again arched darkly across the
screen reflected backward the light
coming from the prisms in a fiery
discharge of flame it erupted around
the edges of both prisms

  came a brittle snap a puff and
the farthest prism disintegrated into
a fine white powder asa cadmore
leaped to his feet snapped off the
master switch and surveyed the
damage

  one of the prisms was still in-
tact the broken one could be re-
placed but if that went-doctor

asa cadmore dared think no further

  theres only one left he mur-
mured but ive got to risk it

  but if asa cadmore had a prob-
lem to overcome so did bruce lan-
yard he stood now beside a wide
road on the outskirts of a city won-
dering just what to do next

  obviously the thing to do was to
darken his skin with some kind of a
stain and to find clothes like those
worn by the planet people but
where could he go to search for ish-
tar how could he find her

  his eyes followed the road in the
far distance and as he looked his
ears detected a throbbing overhead
he flung his body into the vegeta-
tion beside the road and stared up-
ward at the metal sheen of a ship of
the air one of those he had first seen
in the metal screen

  its body was cigar-shaped not un-
like the bag of a dirigible it car-
ried nothing on the outside except
horizontal fins that evidently took
the place of rudder and ailerons
and directly through the center
from nose to tail ran a circular
opening just what power kept the
machine in the air lanyard couldnt
determine it was too small for gas
or hydrogen and it lacked the neces-
sary wings for a plane

  presently a square of metal like a
shutter slid away from the machines
side eyes peered out lanyard
couldnt see them but he knew be-
yond a shadow of doubt that the
men within the machine had seen
him and were watching him

  lower and lower it settled sweep-
ing in circular spirals

  the adventurer looked frantically
around for a way of escape he
leaped to his feet and darted across


astounding stories

a field behind him throbbed the
ship of the air until it hovered di-
rectly over him

 something swished overhead
over his head and shoulders dropped
a net jerking him from the ground

 he felt himself hauled upward
the ground dropped away with the
speed of a rocket through a door
in the bottom of the metal ship
jerked the net strong hands seized
him and hustled him to a higher
landing

  presently he found himself in a
narrow pit facing another of the
bronze race this man was evident-
ly some one of importance his
robes were fastened with clasps of
pure gold around his forehead and
holding his long hair in place ran a
narrow band of the same precious
metal

 the men who had captured lan-
yard released their hold and stood
obediently behind him

  igwar pronounced the leader
extending both hands

  lanyard thought rapidly was it
a greeting and if so was it meant
in friendliness

  igwar he answered

  the leader smiled a stream of
foreign words escaped his lips he
gesticulated wildly pointing at the
ceiling above him

 igwar

 lanyard also smiled he knew
they recognized him as being from
another planet pointing toward the
same spot as had the leader he
spoke a single word

  ishtar

 the effect was magical every-
body in the little room in the strange
ship broke into some manner of
speech the leader silenced them
with an upraised hand he turned
upon the earth man

  ishtar he spoke pointing at
lanyard

 the adventurer nodded at the
same time pointing at himself
lanyard

 the leader evidently was still
puzzled he spoke sharply his
men immediately left the cabin for
some other part of the ship

 within a few seconds the ma-
chine was turning around the lead-
er beckoned lanyard within the con-
trol room a push of a button and
two metal plates slid noiselessly
aside before his eyes opened a wide
vision of straight roads

 presently they hovered over an
immense building that looked va-
guely familiar lanyard recognized
it as the one where he had nearly
lost his head he pointed below
and shook his head violently
ishtar i want to see ishtar
the planet being hesitated he
looked searchingly upon this strange
white man lanyard could see doubt
and a trace of suspicion in his face
evidently he couldnt quite make up
his mind whether this man was a
friend of ishtars or not for long
moments he studied the earth mans
face then as if what he saw pleased
him spoke a few words to the men
controlling the ship

  abruptly the machine rose high
into the air and winged toward a
distant mountain peak for what
seemed an hour they flew before
reaching it at the topmost part of
the mountain appeared a vast level
plateau crowned with a single stone
building

 lanyard heard sharp words of
command and immediately the ship
spiraled downward it came to rest
as gracefully as a bird and hardly
had it landed when the ground be-
neath it began to lower and the
mysterious ship settled into subter-
ranean blackness underground

  lanyard found himself beside the
leader as a trap door in the bottom
prisms of space



of the ship opened he clambered to
the ground the place was now
ablaze with lights revealing a long
tunnel

  after many minutes of walking
the planet beings paused outside a
massive door and knocked two
richly dressed guards opened it from
the far side one of them produced
a sash and bound it against lan-
yards eyes he was aware of being
led through innumerable passage-
ways until all sense of direction was
confused

  presently he felt something
soft underfoot like a rug the
guards halted and removed the sash
the barbaric splendor of a high-ceil-
inged room filled him with awe
cloths of purple and gold hung in
draped festoons at the far end and
directly beneath he saw a throne up-
on which reclined a beautiful girl
familiar yet unfamiliar his gaze
clung to her

  ishtar breathed lanyard softly

  came the cool level tones of the
girl speaking in a strange tongue
the guards pointed to the leader
from the metal ship he in turn
dropped to one knee and murmured a
single word igwar

  slowly the eyes of the beautiful
girl dropped until they rested on the
man who had come from the place
they called igwar

  igwar she repeated dully an
earth man but still no sign of rec-
ognition lighted her eyes

  lanyard felt sudden pain frus-
trated love of many years welled up
in his heart in pulsing torment
ishtar he called dont you know
me its bruce ive come to take
you away

  is this the one she asked speak-
ing in the language used on the
planet that the great jadrow
seeks

  the same replied the planet be-
ing

  you have sworn allegiance to me
grom said the girl in a softer
voice jadrow must never know
that you have brought him to me i
have reasons

  it is written shrugged grom
that a white male god will one
day journey to our planet for sacri-
fice when you came we revered
and honored you we looked upon
you as a forerunner of the white
male that was being sent no prin-
cess ishtar much as i adore you i
cannot have our holy books pro-
faned by shielding the male god
from his destiny upon our planet
ishtar inclined her head gracious-
ly i would be with the white god
alone grom clear the throne room
until such time as i have finished
speaking with him

  grom bowed low and with the
guards left the room almost in-
stantly ishtars regal bearing van-
ished she became again the tender
sweet-faced girl whom lanyard
cherished in memory her arms were
outstretched and her eyes filled
with longing bruce

  lanyard crossed the throne room
at a bound and gathered her into his
arms ishtar he murmured kiss-
ing her lips and pressing her slend-
er body against his own

  tell me bruce she said at last
how you happen to be on this
planet time is precious and grom
may be communicating with the
great jadrow

  lanyard told her everything as
quickly as he could even now
he concluded your father is proba-
bly searching with the space rays
for our location on this planet we
should be outside in the open
ishtar clung to him like a fright-
ened child we must be careful
bruce im afraid of jadrow all


astounding stories

these months hes watched me like a
hawk my strength has been with
the people they have looked up-
on me as a goddess but i cant
stand it any longer if anything

should separate us bruce-

  dont worry dear everything is
arranged but weve got to get out
of here and on some high elevation
is there any other except by the
passage

  yes but its dangerous
anything we do will be danger-
ous- wait a moment can we

fasten the door leading to the pas-
sage

  ishtar slipped from his arms and
cautiously shot two heavy bolts on
the inside of the door come she
whispered	

  together they passed through the
curtains in back of the throne a
sliding panel opened noiselessly
leading into a dark passage but
ishtar seemed to know the way she
held tightly to lanyards hand and
they moved slowly through the dark-
ness

  after anxious moments they came
to a flight of stone steps leading up-
ward they had gone but a short
distance when the faint drone of vi-
brating wires broke in on their ears

  the space rays from your fathers
machine whispered lanyard if

we can get above ground-

theyve stopped

 you dont suppose anythings
happened

 vague shadows of doubt dulled
lanyards hopes he brushed them
aside no nothings happened
im sure of it

  but in his heart he wasnt so sure
he couldnt forget that first broken
prism

  an eerie stillness was in the cav-
ern slowly they toiled upward a
shaft of light appeared in front of
them at a turn in the stairs full

daylight showed ahead their cour-
age returned

  ishtar pointed to a narrow trail
skirting the side of the plateau
this runs to the top its used by
the priests on their way to the tem-
ple of orne

  for long minutes they toiled up
the grade stopping frequently to
listen for any footsteps behind them

  the sudden tolling of bells broke
the silence the clamor increased
until it beat like a storm against the
slanting walls of plateau

  ishtar gripped lanyards arm her
face was white she spoke in a sob-
bing whisper

  its come bruce those bells
never ring except during a national
catastrophe such as the death of our
ruler

 lanyard suddenly saw himself
back again in the operating room-
saw the suctionlike tentacles reach-
ing for his heart fluid the glowing
scalpel the aged ruler of the planet
with his head decapitated

  the operation had failed death
had resulted

  he felt his heart constrict at his
own nearness to death what will
happen now he asked

  an overthrow of the planets gov-
ernment jadrow the ursurper will
try to seize the throne hes our
leading scientist his lust for power
is insatiable since the people look
upon you as a white god he will
seek to destroy you

  lanyard glanced back over the
way they had come is there any
way of getting hold of one of their
airships

  the girl shook her head grom
might have aided us but hes a loy-
alist to the one in power if jadrow
wins grom will be our enemy

  in the silence that followed they
stumbled onward along the narrow
ledge leading upward to the top of
prisms of space



the plateau off to their left tow-
ered a massive building crowned
with a metal dome

  ishtar saw bruce staring at it
the temple of orne she said
sanctuary for priests and scien-
tists we mustnt let the guards see
us or the word will go out

  lanyard grasped the girl by both
shoulders and pulled her behind the
jutting edge of a near by boulder
but his action came seconds too late
they had been seen

  a squad of tall soldiers debouched
from a hidden path leading to the
temple of orne their attitude was
menacing

 run breathed lanyard we
must get to the top

 upward they raced rounded a
curve and came out on a level
stretch of ground and there a sin-
gle man awaited their coming a
man with a gorillalike body and
cruel green eyes he held a gleam-
ing metal tube in his right hand
he was sinister

 the fugitives came to a sudden
stop ishtar raised a hand to her
mouth to choke back the word ja-
drow

  lanyard felt his breath snag in
the back of his throat

 jadrow lurched toward
them guttural sounds flowed from
his mouth they were directed at
ishtar but jadrows green eyes were
fastened on the earth man with a
cold malevolent stare

  he means to kill you cried the
girl

  even as lanyard lunged forward
to grapple with the man the metal
tube slanted toward him

  a crackling bluish spark leaped
outward lanyard felt a sudden
stinging blow against his body con-
fusion overpowered him the cords
and muscles of his body became so

taut that they ached in mid-stride
he stopped stricken immovable

  unable to struggle he was lifted
from his feet and carried away out
of the corners of his eyes he could
see that ishtar had suffered a like
fate he struggled with all the pow-
er of his mind to overcome the par-
alyzing numbness of his muscles

  hopeless

  but though the physical part of
his body was powerless he still had
all his senses was this the end of
his quest had cadmores machine
been rendered useless had the last
lens been broken

  he found himself being carried
into the temple instead of the us-
ual altars and images set up for
strange gods he saw gleaming metal
and sparkling glass

  the temple was a mammoth labo-
ratory

  faces stared at him as he was
slowly carried up an incline toward
the dome of the temple but they
were averted when jadrow appeared

  they reached the top of the in-
cline overhead arched the metal
dome jadrows voice could be
heard barking strange orders the
dome folded back revealing a can-
opy of sky

  it was then that the adventurer
saw for the first time a machine
strangely familiar to that of doctor
cadmores the prisms were dif-
ferent but the metal posts sustain-
ing them seemed much the same

  an old man approached evidently
a priest with a vial of colorless
liquid tilting it slightly he poured
it over lanyards lips

  a strange tingling suffused the
adventurers body the aching strain
on his muscles relaxed and he felt
able to move again

  ishtar was brought to his side
priests and scientists alike bowed
before her regal beauty though


astounding stories

they recognized jadrow as their
master they could not overcome en-
tirely their feeling for this white
goddess who had lived with them for
nearly a year

 jadrow was talking evidently
trying to make them understand
that both earth people should be
destroyed at once they listened
a few of the oldest nodded their
gray heads they had the white god
and goddess in their power their
duty was to destroy the planet
would be ruled henceforth by men
of science religion must be over-
come mind and machinery would
seize the balance of power

 this and much more did jadrow
tell his people lanyard couldnt
understand a word but he vaguely
sensed the meaning back of jadrows
words

  a venerable priest came to the ad-
venturers side and guided him to
where the metal dome began its
great circle from the wall

 his eyes swerved outward and
downward and instinctively he
drew back below yawned a black
abyss

 the venerable man motioned to
ishtar

 hes offering you a choice of
death bruce she told him sadly
decapitation by ax poison or a
leap into the sacrificial pit

 and you ishtar what happens
to you when im gone

 she smiled i go the same way
as you dear

 lanyard opened his mouth to
speak abruptly it closed a faint
humming was in his ears hardly
more than a whisper his eyes hard-
ened and swung upon the machine
which generated the black ray so
destructive to the prisms of asa
cadmores space conqueror

  an indicator on the machine must
have moved one of its attendants

noticed it he made a motion to at-
tract jadrows attention but ja-
drow was watching the earth peo-
ple waiting for their decision

 courage whispered lanyard
i have a plan it may and it may
not work its our only hope tell
the old priest i prefer to die by de-
capitation tell him also that as
soon as my head rolls to the ground
i will pick it up again and restore
it to my body tell him the white
god never dies

  ishtars face paled but she told
the aged priest what lanyard had
requested and with wonder on his
face he obeyed

  a block was brought in a heads-
man was summoned in his hands
he carried a wide-bladed ax of the
same bright material as the frame-
work of the dark-ray machine

 lanyard remained as calm as an
oriental obtaining the priests per-
mission he examined the block he
nodded as if satisfied then he
turned to the executioner and mo-
tioned the man to hand him the
bright metal blade

  bewildered by this show of calm
the man obeyed-and that was the
last thing he ever did

  with a deft swift whirl lanyard
swung the instrument the execu-
tioner fell drenched in his own
blood

  the suddenness of the attack left
everyone inert except jadrow he
lifted his metal tube but before he
could turn loose its paralyzing pow-
er the blade of the axe cut a deep
cleft in his wrist he drew back
snarling the metal tube falling to
the floor

  lanyard leaped lightly toward the
great black eye of the machine the
ax whirled above his head with
all the strength of his arms he
struck at the glowing prism there
followed a brittle crash and the
prisms of space



temple was suddenly filled with a
dense black dust

 ishtar screamed jadrow had
seized her with his uninjured hand
and was dragging her toward the
outer temple wall his intention was
plain he was going to throw her
over the edge into the sacrificial pit
hundreds of feet below

  owing to the darkness caused by
the black powder lanyard could
not see but his ears told him that
she was down close to the floor and
there was no mercy in his heart

  the blade in his hands cut a whis-
tling arc through the air jadrow
dropped in a twisted heap his skull
split through the center

  uproar was on all sides the ad-
venturer picked up the girls body
she had fainted holding her lightly
on his shoulder he plunged into the
disordered mob of priests and sol-
diers he followed the curving wall

 feeling with an outstretched
hand he followed the curve of the
wall till he came to an opening
where a ramp led downward swift-
ly he moved down the incline with
the girl on his shoulder

  halfway down the blackness dis-
appeared and light showed certain
of jadrows soldiers must have di-
vined his purpose for they were
close at his heels

  the adventurer gained the outer
door leading to a court through
this he ran the plateau lay ahead
beyond it the sacrificial pit he
stood in perplexity not knowing
which way to turn his pursuers
were in the courtyard they saw
him

  he backed away still holding
grimly to his weapon they formed
a circle around him one of the
priests appeared his face black with
anger

  the half-circle around him nar-
rowed he backed still closer to the

edge of the pit other soldiers and
attendants poured from the temple
courtyard their eyes ablaze they
were like a mob of hungry wolves

  irresistibly they swept forward
driving the soldiers in front closer
to the cornered man holding the girl
on his shoulder the scarlet blade
lashed out but the mob from be-
hind was not to be denied they
surged forward in a tidal wave of
fury

  the adventurer was forced back
lean coppery hands reached out
the scarlet blade cut a murderous
swathe into them but that swing
threw lanyard off balance he was
forced still farther back and in
doing so he realized he had gone
too far

 the ground trembled beneath
him there was movement beneath
his feet followed by the rasp of slid-
ing gravel so clear were his
thoughts as the ground dropped be-
neath him that he hardly realized he
was falling he could see the mob
of infuriated people of the planet
rising upward as if propelled by
some invisible force

  but that clear thought lasted a
split second only in its place came
an unreasoning desire to live fu-
tilely he tried to reach out and grab
at the edge of the plateau now on
the level with his eyes

 seconds too late the ground
was reeling upward past his startled
eyes he was falling falling into
what seemed endless space-

 there was a rushing gale of
air singing in his ears like the blast
from a mighty propeller land and
sky became a confused blur as he
rocketed downward he closed his
eyes took a firmer grip on the un-
conscious girl and waited for the
end

  sudden light forced his eyes open


astounding stories

the burning radiance hurt them so
much he had to close them again
his head throbbed

  abruptly his body crashed into
something solid and real he heard
the whine of a motor followed by
the tinkle of broken glass a black
curtain whipped across his bewil-
dered brain bedlam turned to for-
getfulness

  how long he lay there he did not
know when consciousness re-
turned he found himself propped
against the wall of asa cadmores
laboratory ishtar was holding his
hand and smiling

 the laboratory was a mass of

twisted wreckage the frames which
had once held those marvelous
prisms were bent and twisted and
the prisms were broken into small
pieces

  lanyard saw the old doctor-in-
ventor standing amidst the wreck-
age swinging a bar of iron the
old man had destroyed his own ma-
chine

  ishtar read his mind yes bruce
father destroyed it

  shes right called out cadmore
the thing was too dangerous and
besides im an old man thatll soipe
day have grand-children

  ishtar blushed

and for showing the sun and the planets and their relative movement and
path the apparatus likewise affords simple adjustable means whereby an
observer can find the position of the stars at any time of the day on any
date

    the astrophane consists of a base which contains the mechanism a
transparent globe is supported on the cover of the base this celestial
globe shows the visible stars and the various constellations the constella-
tions being shown by their boundary lines with their names the stars are
indicated by dots and star-shaped figures in their relative positions in the
different constellations several tftousand are designated the more sig-
nificant stars are connected by dotted lines so that the figures as pictured
by the ancients may be readily found the commonly known stars are
designated by their names or greek letters

    the order of magnitude is shown by their colors and relative sizes
those of the first magnitude being the largest and colored yellow stars of
the second magnitude are somewhat smaller and are colored red stars of
the third magnitude are still smaller and are colored green those of the
fourth magnitude are smaller yet and colored blue and stars of the fifth
and sixth magnitudes are colored purple and shown as the smallest dots
the outline of the different constellations is purple

    midway between the portions representing the north and south poles
of the universe is located the celestial equator indicated by a circumferen-
tial white line in a horizontal plane the equator is divided into twenty-
four equal spaces the right ascension lines pass through the divisions
thereof and extend from pole to pole

the little god was almost forgotten
       -but not  quite-

by ainslee jenkins

it was with hesitation that
tuaoa climbed the dark path
now and again she paused
irresolutely and more than once she
darted aside into the shelter of a
bush to crouch there trembling lis-
tening for the night sound that had
startled her before going on again
but she did go on every time that
she was on the verge of turning
back remembrance of her desperate
need came to her and she knew that
there could be no retreat

 but her spirit quailed before the
mystery of the night and the deeper
mystery of what lay ahead of her
under the flow of the full-flowered
moon the island was as if in a
trance-as if waiting for the old
gods to rise and walk again in all
their power nothing stirred save
occasionally a dreaming wind that
made in the boughs and leaves of the
trees a soft whispering there was
not even the sound of the waves
washing on the reef far below
silence a breathless waiting silence
all around entombing her and in-
side her the beat rapid and uneven
of her heart

 tuaoa paused again her slim
golden-brown body tensed and cold
the dark pools of her eyes frozen
into the shadowy gloom ahead
where the faint trail parted here

i


astounding stories

was the threshold of the mystery
the beginning of the sacred ground
how dared she cross it what aw-
ful wraithlike coils might not wrap
round her smothering out with cold
spirit anger the sacrilege of her
presence she stood like a hunted
thing her breath coming quickly
her lips parted the moonlight
here fell upon her touching with
silvery fingers her long lustrous hair
and the pirohiti flowers which she
had wound through it a sigh-the
wind-was it only the wind-
came from the darkness and the
moving shadows that lay over the
parting in the trail and tuaoa shud-
dered and a sob quivered in her
throat she turned suddenly she
faced back down the path-and she
looked below

 far below she could see the
ghostly white slash of the beach and
the thatched huts of the village all
dark and inside the reef lying like
a great bird with folded wings she
could see the schooner she stared
at it as she looked tiny shadows
moved on the schooners deck and
from its side a small boat dropped
into the water she saw one shadow
climb down into the boat and after
a minute the boat shoved away from
the schooner and crawled across the
quiet water toward the beach
faintly she could hear the splash of
the oars and though the shadow
who stroked the oars was far away
and to her eyes nothing but a
shadow in her mind she could see
plainly his face

  and seeing that face tuaoas
crouching body straightened and
she turned again toward the whis-
pering shadows of the sacred
ground with quick soundless
steps she went forward she did
not glance back again

  the path that she followed now
was old and would not have seemed

a path to a strangers eyes for the
feet that had made it were long
dead a thick-matted screen of
foliage lay over it and the light
from the moon that filtered through
was made strange and deceptive and
not like any earthly light grass
had grown where formerly there
had been bare soil tuaoas feet
rustled through and she could feel
it clinging to her skin as if loath
to let her pass the great dew-
clammy leaves unseen in the misty
light drooped against her face
there were long crimson-flowered
tendrils that wound around her and
drew their moistness lingeringly
across her body and there were
other night-blooming things huge
feathery blossoms that swayed
gently out of the unknown to her
and breathed to her nostrils a per-
fume both sweet and evil and to
either side there were vaults of
utter blackness in which shapes
without substance seemed to twist
and weave and all the time above
her there was the soft sighing and
the moaning

  for this was an ancient path that
was holy to the ancient dead

  but tuaoa brushed the leaves and
the winding tendrils from her way
and though the quick breath heaved
her bosom she did not look aside
or pause in helpless terror she
could hear murmuring around her
the spirits of those vho had on-e
walked here but she knew now that
they knew her need and would suf-
fer her to pass

  then at last she stepped out of
the gloominess into a clear space
where the clear glowing stream of
moonlight fell down as if into a sil-
ver pool here there was no un-
tamed bush growth save for the
grass that floored it although no one
tended it to keep it clear the dark
whispering wall of the bush ringed
in the shadow of the tii



it on three sides and on the fourth
side there rose a great straight cliff
of rock which was the peak of the
island touched with whiteness by
the moon

  at the foot of the precipice his
stony eyes gazing at the human who
had come to his temple sat the tii

  tuaoa stood silent for long min-
utes in awe and in terror then
she ran like a deer across the grassy
space and with a sob flung her
smooth body down in supplication
before the tii

 louis sparth rowed ashore
from his schooner unhurriedly with
easy strokes he always liked to
take his time with pleasant things
drawing all the pleasure out of them
slowly making his enjoyment last
as long as possible moreover he
had had a few drinks just enough
to put him in proper fettle and he
felt relaxed and good he looked
with satisfaction at the trim outline
of the schooner as he drew away
from it he had spent most of the
night sitting in his cabin by him-
self drinking lazily deliberately
putting off the rendezvous he had
ashore and reveling in the knowl-
edge that he could go ashore when-
ever he wanted to and get what he
wanted it was a good life he
thought running a trading schooner
between the far-scattered islands of
the south pacific and at times it
was supremely good right now
was one of those times this island
rurutea being small and with only a
few natives living on it didnt
bring him much in the way of trad-
ing but he was very glad that he
had stopped there

  with a final strong stroke sparth
ran the boat up on the beach and
clambered out it was close to mid-
night and he seemed to be the only
living thing awake for the few huts

of the village were dark and silent
but naru would be awake and wait-
ing for him anxiously smiling
sparth lifted the two cases out of
the boat and crossed the beach-a
big man fleshy and heavy-armed
clad in soiled duck trousers and a
short-sleeved white shirt with thick
black eyebrows and closely clipped
black hair and a blue-black stubble
of beard on his sweaty face the
moonlight fell around him in weird
ghostly radiance he was known all
through the islands louis sparth
better known by natives was the
weight of his great meaty fists

  he passed the first three huts and
came to the dark doorway of the
fourth which was the largest and
set slightly apart from the others
in tahitian for he knew the soft
tongue well he called

 naru are you there naru
from the darkness inside an an-
swering voice said eagerly

  yes yes i am here

  make some light sparth said

  an oil lamp was lighted inside the
hut and the white man entered

 naru crouched by the lamp
looked around with a half-hesitant
smile which widened into a grin
when he saw the two cases sparth
carried good good he muttered
grinning delightedly he was a na-
tive of fifty or so years with a wrin-
kled cunning face and little black
eyes that were restless and quick-
looking his hair was grayish-
white and around the middle of his
small wiry body he wore a dirty red
cloth a paieu-nothing else he
scuttled over to the cases and lifted
out one of the bottles and held it
up to the light rolling his lips and
gurgling ah ah good

 yeah you old souse sparth
grunted in english there it is
enough to keep you reeling for a
couple of months


astounding stories

  ha

  i say there is the whisky
sparth said in tahitian two
boxes as we agreed there is my
part of the bargain now where is
yours

  naru did not appear to hear him
he was fumbling at the cork of the
bottle

  i am talking to you sparth said
harshly where is the girl

  she will be here soon naru
mumbled squatting like a monkey
with the bottle all his attention con-
centrated on opening it

  heavy lines grew in sparths
sweat-dappled brow he stretched
out one great hand and seized the
natives shoulder twisting him
around his eyes were narrowed
and ugly you hear me he said
where is the girl  is she not here
as you promised

  na na naru chattered still
fumbling at the bottle she is not
here but she will be here soon she
will come-only wait a little i
promise you

  sparths other hand shot out and
jerked the bottle away none of
that for you then he said

  na na only wait a little

  i do not wish to wait a little i
wish to leave now with the girl
she will come she will be
here

  sparths teeth grated together he
gripped the bare shoulder more
firmly and shook the mans body like
a rat tell me where she is he
said slowly and take me to her or
i leave now and i will take the
whisky with me

  he knew the threat would work
naru whined and then he mut-
tered 

  she-she has gone up into the
middle of the island

 what for why has she gone
there

she has gone up naru said in
an uncertain whisper to the tii
the tii sparths face was
puzzled what do you mean the
tii what is it

  it was with fear that naru said
the tii-the tii is the devil-
god

  louis sparth laughed he quivered
with merriment well well he
chuckled are there still some of
those things around i thought the
missionaries had broken them all up
so theres a real devil-god here eh
and you all go up and worship him
on dark nights

 na naru whispered glancing
about him uneasily no one goes to
worship the tii any more but he
is very old and very wicked and
very powerful this tii although he
is not so powerful now as he was
in the old time because no one
feeds the spirits inside him with
blood he sits up there in the
sacred place and every night the
souls of those who died before him
and the souls of the priests who
served him gather in the darkness
around the sacred place and moan
and sob and chant their anguish that
no one comes to him with a sacrifice

to his power-

  he looked up at sparths grinning
face and his lips trembled a little as
he went on and in front of him
there is a great flat rock and behind
him there is a great cliff of rock
and in the old time the priests would
take the sacrifice to the top of the
cliff and while the people below
chanted and bowed low the priests
would fling the sacrifice from the
cliff down through the air to the
rock below and the rock is dark

with blood-ancient blood- he

shivered as if the hut had suddenly
become cold

  and the girl has gone there
  the old man nodded yes i
in the shadow of the til



told her you were coming for her
to-night and she ran from me and
cried out to me that she was going
to the tii his voice rose shrill
and pleading but she will come
back soon only wait a little while
-and give me the whisky

 come back soon hell sparth
snarled angrily shell wait up
there until she sees the schooner
leave trying to trick me werent
you he bored the grip of his fin-
gers in viciously well you dont
trick me and there will be no
waiting ill go up and get her my-
self-and you will show me the
way

 na-na na

  or else i go now with the whisky
and smash your face before i go
he clenched his fist and raised it
threateningly so he asked

 do not ask me-i cannot
sparth struck him full in the face
well he said between his
teeth again you want to lose
the whisky

  and naru cowering back looked
with greedy eyes at the two cases of
whisky-and then with an effort
raised himself

 come then he said come
i will show you

 but his courage did not last
sparth had to keep urging him on
with threats and curses the old
man quailed and shuddered at every
shadow his eyes staring uneasily
from side to side his dry lips mov-
ing soundlessly very slowly he
led the sweating and impatient
sparth away from the village to the
steeply rising shoulders of the hills
the moonlight frosted the tops of
the hills their lacy trees and vines
bathed in a cold lifeless pallor but
the flanks lay all in deep shadow
and it was up the flanks of the hills
that the narrow trail wound the
night in narus hut had seemed

warm but here the darkness damp-
ened it and there was a strange cool-
ness in the wind

  the trail twisted and turned ris-
ing always and the soft lap and
plash of the sea below was soon un-
heard there would be minutes of
utter silence-the silence and dark-
ness and mystery of a great cavern
far below the earths crust-when
there would not seem to be any air
or any life or movement at all when
the whole night would seem to be
pausing in breathless anticipation
and then unexpectedly the wind
would stir in the surrounding
gloom and the trees and interweav-
ing vines would wake from their
trance and gently rub and sway
making soft sighings and rustlings
as if some great serpent were mov-
ing his pliant coils

  naru being a native and having
from his ancestors a heritage of be-
lief in the old evil gods and the
dark secrets of the earth felt it all
and knew fear to the roots of his
being a dozen times he halted and
stood frozen moaning his fear and
protesting that he could go no far-
ther and then sparth had to jab
him and wrench him onward and
so they climbed slowly and halt-
ingly sparth stumbling over un-
seen obstructions in the path and
cursing them and lashing out vi-
ciously at the tendrils and moist
leaves that brushed against him-
farther and farther up and up to-
ward the lofty heart of the island

  and then finally in a moment of
dead silence naru came to a com-
plete halt a few feet ahead the
trail parted he pointed to the off-
shoot and said in a faint whisper

  that is the sacred way that is
the way to the tii

  well go ahead

 but here naru stood fast he
could not be budged


astounding stories

  kill me if you will he wailed
i would rather die here by your
hand than be dragged by the spirits
to the cliff and flung down to the
tii

  sparth snorted with disgust he
glanced at the divide in the trail

  how far is it from here to your
damned tii

  not far the path runs straight
and soon it comes to an open space
-and there are the spirits and the

tii- where are you going

  sparth flung back over his shoul-
der  im going to get the girl my-
self

  i warn you naru cried the
tiis wrath will strike you your
blood will spill on the sacrificial rock
before him better wait until the
girl comes back

  bah run away and wait your-
self and when i bring the girl down
ill bring you a present ill bring
you your precious tii-yes ill
throw it into your hut

  he was gone the shadows had
swallowed his big form and soon
the sound of his quick crashing
steps through the bush was gone
too there was left only the mur-
mur and sighing rustle of the slow
wind through the trees

  naru jumped to his feet and scut-
tled back down the trail and as he
ran he muttered

  laugh then fool of a white man
yes laugh-while you can the
tii does not laugh

 very old the tii was and
very small-an ancient dwarflike
thing his twisted body coated by
the unnumbered centuries with dull
grayish-green he was scarcely
perceptible against the great bare
face of the cliff that loomed behind
him but size was not power in
the old days there had been tiis
who were massive in comparison

  with him but now they were dead
their dark bodies shattered and
scattered by the missionaries while
the little tii of rurutea survived
forgotten perhaps by the sons of
those who had come to him in the
past to worship but he sat still in
the place of his power and the
blood-marked sacrificial rock was
still before him and the huge cliff
behind and night after night at the
sacred hour the voices out of the
past spoke to him and the shapes of
the dead moved around him and
chanted the old moaning chants-
and perhaps the tii remembered
for on his flat stony face there
seemed to rest a smile

  remembered perhaps the great
days before the whites came when
the fierce oil-gleaming warriors
would set out in all the bravery of
battle against another island and
would return triumphant with cap-
tives from the people of that island
then the priests would bedeck
themselves in the long feathered
robes and the captives would be
stripped and bound and the people
of rurutea would gather around
them singing the chants of hatred
and vengeance

  and the procession slow-paced
would wind up the trail while the
people sang to the gods of good and
evil who were symbolized in the
body of the tii and they would
prostrate themselves on the sacred
ground while high above on the
brow of the cliff the priests would
prepare the sacrifice a moaning
chant would rise and sob for min-
utes in the air and die into silence
-and in the silence the bodies
would topple from the cliff turning
and twisting and shrieking as they
fell and smash on the rock before
the tii and the tii would be
bathed in blood would be fed as
the people shouted

            ast-
in the shadow of the tii



 many had died before him cap-
tives from alien islands mostly but
also many fair young maidens and
men of rurutea itself-transgres-
sors of the tribal laws many had
come up to him trembling and
afraid on nights when a full moon
rode the skies to plead for his pro-
tection

  and now after years of forgetful-
ness one of his people lay stretched
out before him in supplication he
had been remembered by one at
least

  oh great tii she begged hear
me and guard me with your might
i am tuaoa a daughter of the
priests who served you and whose
sacred bones lie buried here for
their sake i pray you to take mercy
on me for i am in peril and there
is no one who comes forward to pro-
tect me

  our people are no longer proud
and noble as they were in the days
when they worshiped you great tii
they are listless and stupid and
humble like animals and they sub-
ject themselves without protest to
the white mans slightest wish
and now i-i tuaoa a daughter of
the holy priests-am to be sold

 yes for there is a white man
now on our island who desires me
and who has bargained for me and
bought me as if i were a piece of
cloth he is ugly and harsh in man-
ner and he beats with his fat hands
any who displease him as if he were
a god when i saw him i hated
him and avoided him-but he has
power over our people and he can
gain anything that he desires and
so he went to naru my uncle and
naru agreed to give me to him in
return for much of his fiery water
and i am helpless great tii i am
to be taken by this white man away
from the place of my birth and de-
spoiled by him-and lost-

  ast-

  tuaoa sobbed in her anguish she
raised her body lovely in the moon-
light and reached out her hands and
cried 

  save for you great tii for i
believe in you though the others in
the village mock you as lifeless
stone your power is not dead-
the dark spirits still live in you
the spirits of my ancestors still
walk before you and chant the old
chants to you in the night for i
heard them as i came to you and
they are here now around me though
my human eyes cannot see them i
believe that you can stretch forth
your hands and grasp the body of
this white man and destroy him here
on your holy altar and drink his evil
blood take him great tii take
him as a sacrifice as you took evil
ones in the old days and save me
from his corruption

  breathless she was silent and she
was afraid she had invoked the
god she had called on the dark
powers she who like the others
had forgotten the tii had come to
him and put herself within his
reach would he hear her and take
mercy on her for the sake of her
ancestors or would he instead seize
her and avenge himself on her for
the forgetfulness of the people of
rurutea

  she lay listening at first she
could hear nothing utter silence
entombed the sacred place the
moonlight the wicked little figure of
the tii the great cliff behind the
gloomy shadow-filled bush all
around-silent with an unearthly
silence the spirits of the dead who
were buried here and the spirits of
those who had died shrieking in fear
on the sacrificial rock-had they
heard were they rising

  and tuaoa heard a noise

  it was a soft thudding noise from
behind and it was advancing her


astounding stories

heart paused and her throat was
dry she dared not look the
sound came closer it was coming
toward her her hands clenched
and gripped in the grass there was
a great hollowness in her bosom
coming coming right behind her
-upon her

  her shoulder was gripped and she
was wrenched up and around and a
voice that she knew well said
harshly

  so ive found you

  she looked up into the grinning
face of the man she had prayed the
tii to take the exultant face of
sparth

  she tried to tear herself away
from his rough grasp and his hot
breath but he only dug his fingers
in the harder and jerked her closer
to him

  scream your head off he mut-
tered it wont do you any good
and fight-go ahead fight i like
it

  she struggled vainly beating at
the great bulk of him with her small
hands and straining back from the
close grasp and sparth laughed
hugely he enjoyed it with each
blow he clasped her closer to him

  tried to get away didnt you
he grunted up here where you
thought no one would follow you
but youre mine now see youre
coming with me i own you-and
running away wont help you

  you have desecrated the sacred
place she panted

  the sacred place eh still
holding her encircled tightly in his
arms sparth looked around he
looked up at the towering face of
the cliff at the rock below and at
the silent little figure which sat be-
hind the rock so this is the fa-
mous tii he said youve been
praying to him havent you well
whats the matter with him

  he hears the girl cried and
the spirits of his priests hear and
they will hurl you down from the
cliff to this rock as they hurled evil-
doers in the past

 aw dont be a fool sparth
growled get all that stuff out of
your head come on were going
listen her voice was quieter
listen now do you hear do
you hear them do you hear them

chanting the chant of sacrifice-

 something was stirring in the
hushed air over the sacred place
perhaps only the wind in the trees
-but somewhere there was a faint
sad murmuring-a sad slow sound
far away and then close rising and
falling whisperingly so faint and so
indefinite that it seemed to be un-
real and imagined and then for a
moment so close that it was very
real and tuaoa turned her eyes
to the figure of the god

 but the white man snorted an-
grily

  bah he said every time you
hear the wind in the bush you think
its your damned tii you think

that-

  it is the tii it is the long-dead
priests chanting she whispered

 yes sparth glowered down at
the small stone figure well see
what he thinks of this i promised
id bring him down as a present for
your crazy old uncle and here he
goes

  and holding the girls form in
one arm he bent and grasped the
tii wrenched with all his strength
and tore the figure loose

 with one swift movement tuaoa
broke free from his clasp she ran
a few steps and then turned and
faced him there was a fiery light
in her eyes slowly she raised one
arm and pointed at him

  now she said you are dead
now you will hear the chanting
in the shadow of the tii



grow louder and louder and you
will see the priests rise from the
earth and come toward you and
with their chanting in your ears
you will be thrown down before the
tii and pay for your blasphemy
come back here he shouted
furiously

 come back-to you who are
marked by the spirits

  when i catch you this time by
heaven he swore ill beat you for
this come back

  you will never touch me again
you are marked listen-the
chanting grows already

  with an oath sparth tossed the
figure of the god to the ground and
sprang after her but she turned
fleetly and with quick silent steps
fled across the open space into the
gloom of the bush growth melting
from his sight like a shadow

  cursing he crashed after her
the weird darkness of the half-seen
trees and vines enfolded him and
the sacred place was left deserted
again with the little stone tii lying
on his side behind the sacrificial
rock and on his cold lips there
seemed to be still the same smile

  sparth ran at first with all the
speed he could muster he charged
ahead like a great angry bull sweep-
ing the vine tendrils and leaves and
branches aside by brute force
snorting and muttering all the time
in anger he plowed through the
bush in the direction he had seen
the girl take there was no trail
here nor anything like a trail and
the ground was not level as was that
over which he had come to the place
of the tii but his fury disregarded
all obstacles stumbling leaping
hurling his body through the cling-
ing growth he ran like a thing gone
mad with no thought in his head
as quickly as possible he ran
beside that of getting the girl back

blindly for several minutes then
just as the ground began to rise
steeply his foot caught in a root
and he went sprawling full length
into the sodden earth

 panting cursing wiping mud
from his face he sat up a hurricane
of wrath boiling inside him fum-
bled around behind him found the
root and ripped it out and flung it
savagely into the darkness he
lurched to his feet his anger
calmed a little then and seeing how
easily he might get himself lost he
listened for a sign of the girls
whereabouts

  yes there straight ahead a rus-
tling crackling sound-not far
away she had not gained on him
he grinned and forgot the hurt of
his wrenched foot hed have her
soon he strode on again though
more cautiously and peeling his eyes
to keenness against the deceptive
gloom and shadows no need to get
excited he told himself she
couldnt escape

  the ground climbed now and it
was very steep he was soon pant-
ing again from the effort gradually
as his impatience rose he quickened
his pace he stumbled often for it
was hard to see anything and
branches and spiky vines swished
into him suddenly seeming to come

out of nothingness up up up-

something ripped his shirt and a
twig jabbed his face painfully

  hey he shouted whats the
idea you cant get away and the
longer you keep this up the worse
itll be for you hear me

  he listened no soft voice an-
swered but she was there-just a
little way ahead-for he could still
hear the rustling sound

  damn you he yelled his anger
suddenly fury and he broke into a
mad run again

  several times he paused to listen


astounding stories

and each time he heard the sound
that beckoned him on and each time
it seemed to be closer the sweat
was rolling from him after a while
and he was gasping and wheezing
for air and mixing his gasps with
curses and he screamed threats at
the girl

  but soon he no longer cursed or
threatened her he could no longer
spare the breath all his energies
were concentrated into a grim
dogged fight onward he wavered
and staggered on crazily no longer
did he bother to brush the unseen
vines from his path he forced
through them without protest suf-
fering their lacerations he per-
severed as he had never persevered
before give it up turn back
never never-for the rustling
sound ahead was so close now and
closer and closer he could hear it
even above the beating of his heart
and the grotesque wheezing noise
that was his breathing it was al-
most next to him that sound that
he chased in another minute he
would have her-in another minute
he would sink his hands into her
and when that minute passed with-
out sight of her but with the sound
louder it was the next minute that
he thought of and after that the
next and the next-

  louder grew the strange sound in
the gloom ahead and more and more
blindly sparth pursued it

 now now he was there

  he burst out of the shadows into
clear moonlight

  and he shrieked

  clear moonlight a clear space
and the girl who should have been
only feet away from him-she was
not there

  but the sound was

 what was it this thing he had
been following-that hung in the
air and sobbed and moaned and grew

and grew drowning out his beating
heart and his gasps coming in on
him surrounding him what was
it where did it come from

  a moaning it was-but no it
was rising it was a chant a
chanting of many voices deep full-
bodied rising into a great flood of
sound converging on him

  and these things that were rising
wraithlike before him what were
they

  ghostly shapes were rising from
the ground before him coming to-
ward him arms outstretched they
were men they were clad in long
feathered robes and their eyes were
burning and their dark faces were
set in terrible wrath-and they were
staring at him while all around him
was the triumphant chant from the
hundreds of unseen throats

  and in the eyes of these men he
saw-

  louis sparth a tattered witless
thing screamed his horror to the
clear heavens and ran staggering
across the open space his wild pur-
suit had brought him to until there
was no longer any ground beneath
his feet and he fell twisting and
turning and shrieking he fell
through hundreds of feet of noth-
ingness seeing in his last hideous
moment of life the blood-marked
sacrificial rock that lay waiting be-
low and the little figure of stone
that lay toppled over behind the
rock-the smiling figure of the
damnable tii

 tuaoa rose from where she
had lain hidden all the time in the
bush that fringed the sacred ground
she went with bowed head and slow
steps to the tii she looked at the
broken bloody thing that now was
on the sacrificial rock she said

  o tii your power is still great
your spirits still live you heard
in the shadow of the tii



my plea and you brought this man
to the brow of the cliff and your
priests who waited there hurled him
to you his blood is yours

she was silent in the moonlight
and my life is yours great tii
she said to worship you and

bring back the faith in you for i
believed-and i have seen

 and somewhere-the wind-was
it only the wind-a soft slow
sound stirred in the calm moonlit air
over the sacred ground of the little
tii of rurutea

 astounding stories
by jack

dead star
station

the difference between
a fool and a genius can be
stated in one word-success
and success had not found gideon
clew we all tolerated the old man
most of us pitied him some of us
genuinely liked him a neat trim
old fellow white-haired marvel-
ously erect for his age with cheeks
like wrinkled red apples and bright
sober blue eyes

  the lisp in his speech made him
unintentionally droll that must
have been the chief reason why he
had been so long scorned and ob-
scure for the lisp increased with
his earnestness he could never put
his great idea into words without

inadvertently rousing a desire to
laugh

  fourteen of us were waiting on
dead star station in the wild
lonely orion passage for the com-
ing of the space liner bellatrix
thirteen men and a girl twelve
of us made up the crew of the sta-
tion and the thirteenth man was
gideon clew

  the old man of course had no
official right to be upon the station
but mild old captain manners was
soft-hearted and the rest of us sym-
pathetic gideon clew had been
aboard since before most of us were
born-fifty years he said fifty
years is a long time for a man to be
the crippled liner drifted
slowly along

shut up in a little metal world away
from life he had lost his place out-
side he had no one to go to it
would have been cruelty to send him
away

  he had been a generator-man un-
til ten years before the service had
automatically retired him sent out
another man to take his place we
let him stay aboard wrapped up in
the great idea that-had success
chosen to crown it-would have
made him famous we even dug

into our own pockets to make up his
quarterly pay check to provide
funds to carry on the experiment
that was the old mans life

  and the girl was tonia andros

  eight years old she was a slim
little wisp of elfin gravity she was
not actually a beautiful child her
mouth was too wide and her nose
turned up impudently but her dark
eyes were wistfully grave and all of
us loved her after all men so far
from home from family from all


astounding stories

that is life could not be critical of
her

  the story of tonia andros must
have been another of those adven-
tures of space that are the stuff of
romance we knew but a chance
fragment of it months before we
had found the wrecked freighter
drifting a meteor stream from the
nebula had struck it the rusty hull
was riddled and all on board-save
tonia-were frozen and dead

  she had been sealed between the
valves of the main air lock where
some one must have placed her after
the catastrophe the tube of oxy-
gen in the little cavity with her was
exhausted she was unconscious
from asphyxiation and cold but
we reached her in time

  but not in time to save the ship
the wreck was already fast in the
relentless gravitation-field of the
dead star it vent plunging down
to incandescent ruin upon that black
and dying sun carrying with it the
history of tonia andros and what-
ever patrimony may have been hers

  the experience must have been
painful her tortured mind may
have sought relief by blotting that
time out of memory whether she
remembered more we never knew
but she would tell us only her name

  tonia was a friend to each of us
but she and old gideon clew felt a
particular affinity the little girl
haunted his cabin and he seemed
not to fear her hands upon the pre-
cious apparatus he had gathered
there

  the child must have brought
something of the warm glow of life
back into a nature that had been
shut off from life too long gideon
turned aside from his invention to
make toys for her with his skilled
old hands yet he worked ever
harder and he told us that he was
going to adopt her give her home

and education when his discovery
was perfected

  when his discovery was per-
fected-that phrase had been in his
talk for forty years and more

  still the thing was not done and
all of us save gideon clew knew
that it was chimera now we were
waiting for the bellatrix to come
down the passage captain man-
ners was retiring our new officer
was to come upon the liner man-
ners was to take tonia with him-
though the child was not eager to
leave gideon clew-to try to find
a home for her

  the old man himself was torn be-
tween impatience and relief as we
waited for the liner it was almost
breaking his heart to part with the
child who must have been his only
really intimate companion in those
five decades but he was madly anx-
ious for the vessel to come with a
shipment of parts for his invention
that he had ordered a year before

  time can pass slowly on dead
star station a small world com-
pletely isolated the station is
really an obsolete war-rocket too
antiquated to fly with the systems
fleets a corroded metal hull some
two hundred feet long space
aboard is limited quarters cramped
means of diversion lacking

  but beyond the stations vitrolar
ports is space in abundance the
view must be the most weirdly co-
lossal the most awesome in all the
galaxy the great nebula spans the
sky like an octopus of living flame
a vast angry sea of swirling white
fire eerily tinged with the green of
nehulium its twisting streamers
reaching out like incandescent ten-
tacles

  unthinkably vast those tentacles
seem to grasp the dead star that
cyclopean cold sun is a little black
disk limned against livid flame its
dead star station



dark face is patched with marks of
sullen crimson-illimitable seas of
yet molten lava for the dead star
is not utterly dead

  the hurtling meteor-streams and
the seas of incandescent gas that
make up the great nebula of orion
form the most stupendous barrier to
trans-stellar navigation in the en-
tire galaxy light itself at one
hundred and eighty-six thousand
miles per second takes three years
and more to cross it

  but there is a way through the
orion passage a lane kept cleared
of darting meteors and burning gas
by the colossal gravitation of the
dead star a titanic dark sun that
lurks like a black spider in the
bright web of the nebula reaching
out with resistless invisible force
for what it may draw to destruction

  no ship has ever visited the dead
star no rocket could pull away
from its inconceivable surface grav-
ity it is estimated that a human
body would weigh well over a hun-
dred tons upon its surface-enough
so that the bones would break and
the flesh run away from them like
water the idea is unpleasant

  the station equipped with power-
ful electron-blast motors to keep her
clear of the giant suns inexorable
pull was established as an aid to
navigation in the passage her duties
being to chart the continually shift-
ing meteor-streams inform passing
shipping by photophone of the safer
courses and to go to the aid of any
endangered vessels

  time passed slowly upon the tiny
metal world of the station that was
but a mote hung between titan black
sun and the changeless fiery glory of
the nebula but at last the bella-
trix came and from dull weeks of
waiting we were plunged inconti-
nently into mad confusion

  the bellatrix was a new vessel of

three times the stations tonnage
regularly plying the passage those
of us who could went aboard the
liner during the little time the
valves were coupled to enjoy briefly
the spaciousness of the vessel her
cosmopolitan atmosphere the gos-
sip of her curious passengers

  vance our photophone operator
returned with one interesting bit
he talked to one of her passengers
a man in an invalid chair with a
bandaged head this man told him
that the bellatrix carried an im-
mensely valuable cargo of uranium
ingots and that her officers had been
warned to beware of skal doon the
inter-stellar buccaneer

  even so there was no great nov-
elty in a warning against skal doon
he was one of the last freebooters
of space the most notorious and
daring for three decades he had
been a terror of the void escaping
capture partly by a flair for origi-
nality partly by ruthless cruelty in
the elimination of opponents and
largely by an intimate knowledge of
the mazes and fiery ways of the
great nebula which he knew as no
other man it is curious that men
spoke of him with a certain admira-
tion and respect which he deserved
as little as a human being could

  gideon clew and tonia andros
parted at the valves the childs
wistful eyes were frankly tearful as
captain manners led her away and
old gideons lisping voice choked
oddly and then the old man went
to claim the long carefully wrapped
package that had come for him-the
anxiously awaited parts for his in-
vention

  presently the new captain came
aboard the station clive kempton
was his name a tall young man in
severe white uniform with the
eagle insignia of the service on his
cap his face was lean and stern


astounding stories

we saw at ones that he was the sort
that takes responsibility very seri-
ously that considers regulations
much more holy than they are-per-
haps because of a subconscious fear
of criticism

  a little time of bustling mad con-
fusion stores coming aboard cylin-
ders of oxygen drums of fuel for
our generators then the last shout
of farewell the valves were sealed
again uncoupled and the bella-
trix went on

 we upon the station were left-
or so we supposed-to wait through
other weary weeks until another
vessel picked its way between the
flaming walls of the passage none
of us had premonition we were to
see the liner again so soon and un-
der such distressing circumstances

  hume the stations mate was in
the bridge room with the new cap-
tain when gideon clew limped hesi-
tantly in with a hopeful smile upon
his red wrinkled face

  captain thir he lisped a little
timidly

 what is it kempton asked
brusquely whats your name
he did not intend to be unkind
he was taking his new command
much too seriously the vague
blind hostility and the supernal
power of the great nebula and the
titanic dead star had already set
their print of terror in his soul

 gideon clew thir you thee
thir i have invented a gravity-
screen ive just installed the last
parts that came on the bellatrix
pleathe thir may i use power from
the ships generators to test it
whats this a shield you mean
against the force of gravitation
yeth thir ive been working on
it many yearth thir

  perhaps if it had not been for
gideons lisp kempton would have

listened but the lisp made the
bright-eyed apple-cheeked little
man unconsciously and pathetically
funny and the more serious he be-
came the worse his lisp and
kempton was young he had not yet
learned that regulations are made
to be broken

 how much power do you need
he asked

  two hundred thousand kilowatts
thir

  kempton astonished looked in-
quiringly around at hume

  why thats the full capacity of
our generators

  i know thir but just a few min-

uteth-

  just who are you anyhow the
captain demanded

  gideons wide blue eyes stared at
him in bewilderment and hume
spoke to explain the old fellows
status upon the station

  you know its against regula-
tions for you to be here at all
kempton said you must prepare
to leave clew when the bellatrix
returns i dont understand how it
happened

 but thir the power-

  i must refuse your extraordinary
request of course i want you to
realize this is not a playhouse and
not an old mans home i dont un-
derstand it

  the serious bright eyes about the
mans little red cheeks were fixed
intently upon kemptons face for
a long time then they began to
blink and hume saw huge slow
tears gathering in them

  yeth thir gideon whispered
and he stood there

 kempton and hume were busy
with the astrographic charts check-
ing their maps of the nebulas flam-
ing streamers which flooded the
bridge with greenish ghostly radi-
ance kempton seemed to forget
dead star station



clew and the little man stood there
blinking it must have been ten
minutes later that he spoke again
captain kempton thir

 eh oh youre still here
what is it

  the bright eyes winked bravely
captain you dont understand
thir ive been working on my
gravity-screen nearly fifty yearth
ever since i first came here thir
it was the dead thtar tho near i
got books on electronics i studied
hard thir

  other men have come and gone
thir even the mechanics stay only
thix yearth you know because it
is tho lonely now thir it is done
an electronic field a screen of ions
that flows over the surface of any
conductor and reflects dissipates
the radiations of gravity

  kempton laughed he did not in-
tend to be malicious there was
something irresistibly funny about
gideon clew lisping so seriously

  why gravitation isnt even a ra-
diation man its a strain in the

ether a curvature-

  i know thir that is one theory
but i have proved it is a radiation
on the order of the subelectronic

particles-

  kempton was suddenly brusque
angry with himself because he had
laughed

  anyhow youll have to give it
up weve no fuel to waste on fool
experiments

  he bent over the charts again
gideon clew turned dazedly toward
the door moisture glittering un-
heeded on his bright wrinkled
cheeks it is not easy for a man to
give up what he has worked for all
his life-not when he has labored
and planned and dreamed as had
gideon clew

  he turned and lisped again cap-
tain thir

 what is it now kempton
showed his annoyance at the inter-
ruption

  captain theres tonia andros
a little girl that we took off a
wreck when my invention is suc-
cessful thir i am going to adopt
her-

 sorry clew im busy kemp-
ton nodded at the door

  yeth thir

 gideon clew blinked and turned
slowly again he fumbled for the
door knob with twisted old fingers
and could not see it wait came
kemptons brisk voice and he
turned sober blue eyes shining with
incredulous hope

  thir

  i suppose youve a clutter of ap-
paratus in your cabin see that
its cleared out have it all in or-
der when you leave

  but captain thir i cant disman-
tle my apparatus im an old man
ill never have money or a chance
to try it again oh dont you thee

 there was something in the ap-
pealing blue eyes that kempton
could not resist

 all right he said suddenly
ill have mr colin supply you the
power-output for exactly five min-
utes i shouldnt do it its against
regulations

  gideons face was wrinkled into a
grin of radiant joy his round blue
eyes shone mistily

  go on now and try it kemp-
ton said and afterward clear the
rubbish out of your cabin

  gideon vanished and the stations
lights were dim for five minutes and
the electron-blast motors dead for
that long allowing us to drift to the
unopposed drag of the dead stars
relentless gravity

 during those minutes gideon
clew was furiously busy in his
cabin among complex apparatus


astounding stories

that filled it so completely that there
was scant room for his body trans-
formers hummed and the tall
vacuum tube that the bellatrix had
brought filled with pallid virescent
fire he closed a switch that
grounded one of its electrodes to the
stations hull a feeble green glow
shimmered along the wire

  gideon clew felt the ship pause
beneath him as that slow drift to-
ward the dead star was arrested
crying out from sheer pain of joy
at success after fifty years of foil
he watched in proud wonder

  plop

 he heard the hollow muffled
sound heart sinking he spun
around green radiance was gone
from tube and wire the new tube
had burned out

 captain thir gideon lisped
with earnest eagerness back on the
bridge didnt you feel our drift-
acceleration stop when my elec-
tronic screen cut off the attraction
of the dead thtar

  no im afraid not and remem-
ber our bargain now youve had
the power now you must dismantle
your machine and get it ready to
take on board the bellatrix

 but captain i know-

 clive kempton turned reached
for an ellipsograph he was a young
man full of his new responsibility
and he did not realize how much
gideons experiment had meant to
the old fellow

  the bright sober eyes were blink-
ing very fast trembling hands
fumbled blindly at the door gideon
clew let himself out and stood a
long time leaning against the wall
an old man sick with failure he
was glad that none came near him

 the bellatrix flashing onward
along the flaming corridor of the
passage was still in photophone
communication with us a private

call came for gideon clew and
vance olir operator sent the stew-
ard to find the old man

  a call for me thir he lisped in
excited astonishment as he shuffled
into the photophone room it must
have been the first in fifty years

  vance made him sit down in front
of the projection screen and tuned
his set and synchronized the scan-
ning tube the bright-hued geo-
metric figures of the registration
pattern vanished suddenly and on
the screen was tonia andros

  oh granddad she cried in a
voice atremble with eager joy and
relief and she ran forward until
she went out of focus and blurred

 smiling reassuringly gideon
lisped what ith it tonia

  vance and the other operator were
inevitable eavesdroppers for with-
out their continual adjustments the
narrow etheric nerve between the
ships would have snapped in half a
minute the two seemed to forget
them

  the little girls image sharpened
again and she stood there bewil-
dered dark eyes round and huge and
solemn

 oh granddad she pleaded-
she always called him that im so
lonesome i made them let me talk
to you i want you to come and
stay with me please wont you
you said you would come when your
invention is done please hurry

  gideon clenched his gnarled old
hands and his blue eyes glistened

  no tonia he whispered no

im afraid- he choked and

stopped tears rolled out on his
cheeks and he did not heed them
no tonia he cried again my
invention-will never be-finished
and tonia i-have to go away-

 but granddad her grave
voice was distressed you prom-
ised me you must
dead star station



  tonia he cried convulsively
tonia i will in spite of every-
thing ill come after you

 she laughed happily then the
other operator must have spoken to
her for she looked away from the
screen and back again

  good-by granddad she called
ill wait

  good-by tonia whispered gid-
eon clew but the connection had
already been cut and he spoke to a
blank and empty screen

 not an hour later vances
call-bell rang again urgently

 when the set was tuned he saw
the bellatiixs operator on the
screen and swift realization of
tragedy overcame him the mans
cap was gone his face haggard his
eyes wild with desperation his
white uniform vance saw was torn
at the shoulder one sleeve crimson
with blood that dripped and spat-
tered on the floor

  the mans lips were working nerv-
ously he was gasping apparently
he was too frightened to speak

 cool off vance shot at him
what is it

 come- he cried incoherently

for lifes sake they murdered
the captain come

  vance heard blows upon the bel-
latrixs door and shouts beyond it
the wounded operator turned and
stared mutely as three men burst
it open and came in all of them
carrying glowing ionic needles the
operator stood facing them trem-
bling helpless blood dripping from
his sleeve

 vance knew the leader of the
three at once by one feature of his
face described in many warnings
and offers of reward he had no
nose only a blue ray-scar where it
should have been with two black
slits for nostrils

  skal doon the space pirate
the terror of the nebula

  calling the eagles eh he de-
manded of the operator his voice
was thin and shrill vance had a
vague feeling that he had heard it
before though he knew he had never
seen skal doon setting the serv-
ice on skal doon eh

  his hand tightened on the ionic
needle and it spat blue sparks the
operator threw up his arms and spun
around screaming the ray had
burned away his face but sickening
minutes passed before he collapsed
and was dead

  skal doon watched him until he
was a shuddering heap on the floor
then he looked into the screen at
vance and vance never forgot his
amazing eyes large they were
limpidly brown soft and gentle as
a womans

  so our friend did call you eh
his thin voice shrilled and he
kicked the trembling thing at his
feet and maybe you have seen
enough so you can guess what hap-
pens to eagles that swoop at skal
doon

  vances sickness at the horror he
had seen must have been evident
enough the mild brown eyes
smiled at him the high voice made
a ribald jest at his condition then
the ionic needle came up again spit-
ting blue fire and the screen went
blank

  only then did vance recognize
that shrill voice it was the voice
of the man with the bandaged head
and the invalids chair with whom
he had talked on the bellatrix of
the man who had talked ironically
of skal doon

  the bellatrix of course was not
a fighting ship her only weapon
was a long rccket-torpedo tube that
had been mounted ironically
enough for protection against the


astounding stories

very buccaneer who had seized the
vessel

 though the stations fighting
equipment was obsolete consisting
only of four rocket-tcrpedo tubes
and the sealby arc-which hurled a
blasting shaft of electricity from
the generators-we might easily
enough have destroyed the liner
but destruction was not our aim
we had to consider the hundreds of
passengers aboard

 well have to run them down
capture the ship kempton told
hume on the bridge and that
torpedo-tube will make them hard
to take

 doon knows how to play his
cards hume agreed

  even with the stations powerful
electron-blast motors installed for
her ceaseless battle with the gravi-
tation of the dead star we did not
come up quickly with the fleeing
liner it was ten hours before the
battle began after the long ten-
sion of suspense it was a swift and
confusing thing

 gideon clew came running up
hopefully to kempton soon after
the bellatrix was sighted-a silvery
speck fleeing between the white cur-
tains of the great nebula the violet
fluorescent trail of her electronic
motors streaming out behind her

 captain thir in the battle-
what do you want me to do

  his round blue eyes were bright
with eager determination but
kempton turned on him impatiently

just keep to your cabin clew
the crew is complete without you
but thir he lisped protestingly
tonia i must help save her

she-

  go below clew

 red wrinkled face suddenly
downcast sober eyes glittering the
old man stumbled out of the room
as the station came up with him

doon began to fire the first rocket
we were able to avoid by an abrupt
change of course the second and
the third were detonated at a dis-
tance by the searing flame of the
sealby arc

  but the fourth slipped past the
searching finger of the arc a hur-
tling mote a miniature ship death-
laden it struck amidships the
station lurched sickeningly to its ex-
plosion fragments of the beryllo-
steel hull were driven inward with
terrific force and an instant later
our precious air was screaming out
through the sudden ragged open-
ing chilled by expansion until snow
glittered in it

 colin the chief engineer was
killed outright by a splinter of the
hull hale the second darted at
once with his two helpers to repair
the hole snatching down the metal
patches and the thermite welding
units that always hung ready on the
wall

  the task was not easy one of the
helpers was carried bodily through
the opening by the outrushing air
to hideous death then patches
were flung over the ragged orifice
and the major leak soon stopped
but the shock had strained all the
seams of the old hull though hale
and the remaining assistant found
and mended many breaks the vital
air continued to hiss out alarmingly

  thus for a time the generators
were deserted by their regular crew
and just at the moment when power
was most necessary the station
was swiftly overhauling the be ma-
trix on the bridge kempton was
screaming a fervid appeal into the
speaking tube

  for lifes sake colin give me
power for the sealby arc be-
fore they can reload that tube

 but the engineer was dead and
the surviving members of his staff
dead star station



were completely engaged in a des-
perate battle to preserve the sta-
tions essential atmosphere

  yet the generators came again to
sudden animation and the blue arm
of the electric arc reached out once
more it touched the rocket-torpedo
tube in its armored housing above
the hull of the bellatrix and the
tube became fused and crumpled
metal

  skal doon though thus robbed of
his only offensive weapon was still
not defeated he displayed again
that resource which so often had
saved him an original daring worthy
of a greater man the liner delib-
erately changed her course swung
about in a long curve and plunged
downward toward the dead star

  diving for the star cried hume
in dismay going to smash rather
than surrender

 with silent attention kempton
was studying the motion of the
argent ellipsoid through his instru-
ments he laid them aside at last
and turned suddenly to the mate

  no skal is cleverer than that
he is planning to fall around the
dead star and back away from it

 around it how-

  the bellatrix is on a parabolic
orbit like a comets it will flash
down to the star curve close around
it and fly off again or would-if
we werent here to stop it

  youre going to follow

  of course well run them down
fasten the station alongside with the
magnetic anchors the bellatrix
has no weapon if skal wont sur-
render well storm a valve or cut
through the hull

  he looked at the barometers and
his face fell with alarm

  that last shot finished us any-
how were gone unless we can get
aboard the bellatrix the pressure
is down two pounds already our

air wont last three hours at this
rate

  the silvery hull of the liner was
plunging toward the dead star with
motors full on kempton shouted
again and again into the speaking
tube for more power no voice an-
swered but the generators always
responded

  the bellatrix was now but a few
miles ahead abruptly she began
a confusing series of maneuvers to
evade the station twisting swerv-
ing but lighter and more power-
ful the station kept close behind
her

 the liner turned back at last
plunging directly at the other ship
with manifest intent to ram it to
the destruction of both vessels
kempton shouted a wild command
the generators replied instantly and
the station slipped out of the way

  another order and a heavy mag-
netic anchor leaped from its cata-
pult toward the passing ship drag-
ging its cable it struck the liners
hull clung fast

  like a silver fish the bellatrix
plunged and darted for a time upon
the line but the smaller station
held her adroitly giving her oppor-
tunity neither to ram nor to break
the cable and steadily the ships
were drawn together as the cable
was wound upon its drum

  the purple fluorescent blast from
the liners motors was at last shut
off the two ships drifted side by
side at the cables ends-hurtling
down toward the black red-flecked
disk of the dead star

  the stations air leaking steadily
through opened seams was swiftly
growing unbreathable men panted
at ordinary tasks a deadly chill
stole through the ship

  kempton called us all to the up-
per deck ordered us to don space
suits he served out ionic needles


astounding stories

and other weapons ordered torches
got ready for cutting through the
liners hull if that proved necessary

  colin he called into the speak-
ing tube bring your men on deck
were going to abandon ship

 this ith not colin lisped a
voice from the tube

 who clew what the-

  colin ith dead thir i have been
running the generators i was a
generator-man forty yearth you
know

  kemptons voice was queer all
right clew good work come on
and get into your space suit

  five minutes later the eleven of
us were dragging ourselves across
between the ships in clumsy in-
flated suits laden with weapons as
weird a journey as can be imagined
it was eleven swollen giants
climbing by their hands along a
cable between two vessels in the
void for background the flaming
streamers of the great nebula and
the malign black disk of the dead
star

 then happened an unexpected
thing-a dreadful thing

  the main valve of the bellatrix
flung suddenly wide and a score of
human figures spewed out we
thought at first that the pirates were
foolishly leaving the ship to beat off
our attack but these men had no
space suits

 in the blast of air they were
thrown clear of the ship to become
in the vacuum of space queer swol-
len monsters but horribly they
did not immediately die sprawling
in the airless void they tore at their
throats faces contorted with agony
unutterable

  an atrocious murder of helpless
passengers most of us thought we
dragged ourselves hastily on hot
with resentment to seize the valve
before it could be closed to fight

our way from it into the ship and
avenge this thing

 strangely-ominously-our en-
trance was not opposed

 when we opened the inner seal
skal doon alone and apparently un-
armed met us on the deck inside a
curious grim smile was upon his
noseless face and his mild limpidly
brown eyes were mocking

 skal doon kempton barked at
him youll answer for the ruthless
murder of those innocent passen-
gers

  but my dear sir the buccaneer
protested in his queerly thin voice
those were my own men surely
you cannot object

 eh the passengers-

  -have not been injured i assure
you they are safely confined to
their quarters i put my men
through the valve as an act of
mercy

 you might explain kempton
menaced him with an ionic needle

  doon smiled again twistedly and
shrilled

  you seem to have understood my
plan captain to fall in a parabola
about the dead star

  yes a simple trick

  when i saw you follow captain
i realized that you understood and
with the ship on your cable i real-
ized that i had lost the game i was
forced to select another means of
escape accordingly some distance
back i changed the course of the
bellatrix

 what kempton demanded
what did you do

  youll find out i fancy and to
prevent your undoing my work i
have also wrecked the motors and
short-circuited the generators in
such a manner as to burn them out

 but-but your escape-

  you have already witnessed the
escape of my men i am now fol-

            ast-
dead star station



lowing them but my deeds you
will find are to live after me

  doons jaws contracted suddenly
and something crushed between his
teeth still smiling he spat blood
and fragments of glass

  farewell captain and a safe
voyage-to the dead star

  he saluted ironically and fell
heavily upon his face

  in a few mad minutes we veri-
fied all he had told us the pas-
sengers were safely locked below
the machinery was wrecked beyond
the possibility of repair hume and
kempton went to the liners bridge

  the bellatrix they found was
plunging toward the dead star
upon a path that would end in flam-
ing catastrophe doon realizing his
defeat had turned the liner from
the parabolic orbit toward that ti-
tanic black sun truly his deeds
lived after him

  one glance at the graviscope or
gravitational field detector told
hume that doom was inevitable
already the needle was pulled to
the end of its scale even with the
full power of her now useless mo-
tors the ship could not have fought
free of that relentless drag

  tonia andros unharmed came
running across the deck when the
imprisoned passengers were re-
leased she found gideon clew and
threw her arms around him the
old man bent and caressed her hair
and looked into her dark wistfully
happy eyes

  then hume came back from the
bridge with the dread news that we
were falling toward the dead star
helpless doomed

  gideon lifted the little girl in his
arms and held her tight for a little
time and then set her down

  good-by tonia he whispered
there is something i forgot i

  ast-

must go back on the station a little
while captain manners will take
care of you run to him now

  he pushed the grave-eyed bewil-
dered child away and hurried to-
ward the valve hume followed
him asked

  you arent going back on board
clew its death no air

  the old man paused and his sober
blue eyes looked back at the puz-
zled solemn child

  yeth he lisped i must go
for her

  he got back into his space suit
and hume let him out

  the stations atmosphere was very
thin when gideon clew returned-
and cold it glittered in the pale
yellow tube-light with a frigid
frosty glint he could hear the sibi-
lant whisper of it as it hissed out
into the frozen void

  he left his space suit in the air
lock its tube of compressed air
would have lasted perhaps an hour
longer but his hands in its clumsy
gloves could not do the delicate
work he had set for them

  less than an hour without it was
left him already he was breath-
ing hard as he made his way into
the forecastle gasping painfully
from the slight exertion of walking
and there was much to be done-
fifty years labor to be brought to
completion

  synthetic air was still hissing
noisily from the cylinders perhaps
as fast as it was leaking from the
hull but the cylinders in a few
more minutes would be empty and
the cold due to swift expansion of
escaping air filled all the ship the
chill of it seared gideons gasping
lungs

  for a little time he stood panting
shivering among the complex ap-
paratus in his own tiny cabin his la-
boring heart thumping against his


astounding stories

throat he felt tears come into his
eyes at sight of these familiar in-
struments offspring of laborious
years they seemed living intimate
he did not matter but the dead
star should not have his invention
nor tonia

 with trembling hands he began
the task he first removed the tall
vacuum tube from its mountings
and broke its air seal when the
rooms frigid air had hissed thinly
into it he unscrewed the base to
examine the damage done when the
tube had burned out

  the fine wires of the secondary
electrode were fused in silvery beads
against the cathode grid he turned
the delicate parts in his quivering
gnarled old hands and studied them
trying to puzzle out the original de-
fect that had caused the disaster
he searched patiently

  even as he stood still he had to
gasp for breath his head throbbed
the utter unthinkable cold of space
crept inexorably into the room
frost danced in the air gideon
clew shivered and absently drew his
thin jacket closer about his erect
old shoulders one old man he
was pitted against the searching cold
and the vacuum of elemental space-
against the relentless gravitation of
the dead star but he took no time
for despair

  at length he saw the defect the
filament should have been longer
the grid set back a little and turned
so a simple change

  he found a coil of tiny wire and
delicate tools and began to make the
repair that was not difficult the
hard part would be to evacuate the
tube again it was useless with air
inside and he had no pump or time
to use it

  the new parts fitted he screwed
the base back into the tube and then
attacked the problem of exhausting

it he knew a way difficult peril-
ous-but quick

  as rapidly as he could with numb
aching hands he sealed a piece of
metal tubing into the tube then
he found his rotary drill fitted it
with his longest point and attacked
the cabins outside wall

  that wall was the beryllo-steel
hull of the station beyond its four
obdurate inches was the vacuum he
needed trembling he leaned on
the handle of the tool cold was
piercing into him his head ached
his ears drummed blood began to
drip from his nose drop by crim-
son drop to freeze on the floor

  he reeled dizzily but clung to his
task the drill whirred in his
hands quivered bit slowly into
tough metal its motor made a lit-
tle heat grateful to his stiffened
fingers he tried to hold them closer
against it

  at last the point slipped through
he drew it back and the air whis-
tled shrilly through the hole out
into the void of space just as he
had planned he fitted the end of
the metal tubing into it crudely ce-
mented it now the vacuum of space
would draw the air from the re-
paired electron tube

 he closed the switches and
started to the generator room

  the hissing in the corridors had
ceased the air-cylinders were
empty again the pressure in the
ship was dropping and swiftly

  gideons old heart labored so that
he held a numb hand against it he
was suffocating the thin cold air
seemed to be sucked out of his
pumping lungs his head roared
and throbbed his pulse drummed in
his ears blood was still oozing
from his nostrils cold and sticky on
his face

 and his body was wooden every
movement was a battle against
dead star station



leaden inertia every effort burned
vital oxygen increased the strain on
heart and lungs but he must go on
-start the generators

  now on hands and knees he
crawled along the corridor his
hands were stiff lifeless things no
sensation came from them as they
fell upon the metal floor

  no longer could he see black-
ness crowded upon him lit with
strange lurid flashes of crimson
his head whirled he felt that the
ship was swinging spinning under
him a blind automaton he crawled
on and the face of tonia andros
danced before him smooth and
childish dark eyes wistfully solemn

  every tissue of his leaden tor-
tured body screamed at him stop
stop rest forget

  so he came at last into the genera-
tor room with infinite effort he
pulled himself up against the instru-
ment board there he leaned gasp-
ing trembling blood trickling from
his nose-straining every atom of
his will to see

  the darkness at last cleared for a
moment and the roaring quieted in
his head he read the dials and
with stiff hands moved the switches
all the processes were familiar
automatic if only he could hold
himself up to carry them out

  he grasped the final lever with
dead insensate paws and drew it
down as he fell

  the old man lay gasping upon the
floor blood gushing from his nos-
trils in a scarlet frothy flood-but
he heard the soft whir of the gen-
erators the shrill rising whine of
transformers

  all of us were silent for a
time upon the bellatrix when
hume told us that gideon clew had
gone back we were all thinking of
his cheery old face with its red

cheeks and its round sober blue
eyes of his faith his optimism
and all of us were sorry we would
never hear his lisping voice again

  but our minds were soon fever-
ishly back upon more immediate
things

  after all its rather a splendid
way to die vance told hume but
his voice was unsteady

  they had gone back together to
the bridge and from its vitrolar
panels stood watching the incan-
descent wonder of the nebula the
dead star grasped in its fiery ten-
tacles a growing black disk
splotched with red

  the battered oxide-reddened hull
of the station was drifting along-
side at the end of her cable her dark
ellipsoid outlined against the green-
tinged flaming vortexes of the neb-
ula hume looked at it

  perhaps he said with slow de-
liberation but old clew- go-
ing back to work with his machine

till the end-

  vance did not reply and they
gazed out upon the supernal majesty
that infolded them the great
nebula angry swirling masses of
virescent fire white curtains and
streamers and sheets greenish daz-
zling clotted condensations cos-
mic clouds of flame shrouding a
grim lifeless sun the dead star
ominous black disk against lucent
glory its lurid crimson spots-seas
of molten lava wide enough to swal-
low planets-stared back like red
evil eyes

  vance laughed hollowly nerv-
ously he whispered when
hume turned found an astro-sex-
tant on the chart table he put it to
his eye and read the apparent di-
ameter of the dead star and busied
himself with his pocket calculator

 five hours-

 vance said nothing and they


astounding stories

watched the menacing red-spotted
blackness of the dead stars face
it was minutes later that he licked
his lips and added

  the acceleration increases of
course as we fall nearer just above
the surface the force upon us will
be upward of a ton for every pound
of our bodies we will have no
sensation of it though because we
are falling with it free and we
arent heading directly for the cen-
ter of the disk momentum will
carry us part-way around well

strike on the other side-

  a long silence and vance spoke
again

  old clews gravity-screen no
wonder he went daft on it looking
down in the dead star for fifty
years and no doubt dreaming of
something like this

  he laughed loudly mirthlessly
kempton gathered the nervous
bewildered passengers into the main
saloon and spoke to them

  we are falling into the dead
star he said nothing in the
universe can save us nothing short
of a breach of the law of gravitation
but the end will not be painful we
will flash instantaneously into incan-
descent gas i advise you to get the
most you can out of the few hours
left to us the whole ship is at your
disposal i will welcome any plans
for diversion

  but if any of you should feel
that you cannot endure the strain of
waiting you will find the ships
surgeon ready in the sick bay with
painless anaesthetics

  he stopped with a gesture to in-
dicate that he was done the pas-
sengers milled about white-faced
and stared unknowingly at each
other as if they had all been stran-
gers

  tonia andros was going about
the decks asking in a bewildered

and fearful voice where gideon was
and why he didnt come back
kempton found her and brought her
with him to the bridge through
the transparent panels she saw the
dead star a black red-pocked disk
ever increasing hung against cur-
tains of supernal light

  she shuddered drew back

  its like a face she cried

with red eyes gloating-

  and with anxious solemnity she
demanded of hume where is my
granddad

  the mate pointed to the station-
a battered twisted mass against the
flaming arms of the nebula

  lets go across she cried with
big-eyed wistful earnestness i
want to find my granddad

  hume shook his head its no
use tonia the air was leaking
out he wont come back hes-
gone now

  the mate averted his eyes and the
little girl still stared bewilderedly
into the vitrolar panels

  look she cried out the green
light what is it do you see it
there there

  then hume saw a pale virescent
glow spreading swiftly over the bat-
tered red hull like a film of oil upon
water green luminescence streamed
down the cable to the bellatrix in
an instant it was shining upon the
metal frames of the vision panels

  then a bell clanged from the
graviscope and he ran back to it
he saw that the needle that a mo-
ment before had been drawn to the
end of its scale by the terrific pull
of the dead star had returned to
zero in unbelieving wonder he
stared at the instrument then he
spun upon kempton eagerly

  the old man was trying to gen-
erate an ionic screen that would re-
flect the radiation of gravity that
green glow is his screen-i know it
dead star station



is and the graviscope shows that
we have been cut out of all gravi-
tational fields

  and i kempton muttered i

thought-just an old fool-

  dont you see what it means
hume cried in sudden feverish
eagerness we arent going di-
rectly toward the dead star and
now it cant curve our path any
more well fly on past well

have time to make repairs or photo-
phone for aid

tonia andros was staring at him
with round wide eyes

then granddad is still all
right she cried lets go across
and find him

she snatched kemptons hand
tugged toward the door

yes hes all right he whispered
and yes-well go-

preparedness

        it is well known that france has been at work for years upon
    an immense underground fortification along her eastern frontier
    the first definite word has just come from there

        an uninterrupted series of subterranean vaults of steel iron
    and cement form one vast city one hundred kilometers in length
    thousands of cubic meters of earth cover it-leaving it at mine
    depth with occasional vaults for the mouths of cannon

        there are brilliantly lighted avenues-speedy and fairly com-
    fortable trains for transportation entire armies could exist in this
    underground citadel for months at a time

        there are reports of a hidden abyss for the destruction of
    invading forces of dams which might unleash thousands of tons
    of water over the surrounding countryside france is preparing
    for any invasion that may come
by holloway horn

thats the haunted
room-but as to ghosts
im a materialist

the

man

the setting was perfect
in the foreground the
branches of a cedar tree
swept the velvet lawn behind it
mellowed by the centuries stood the
elizabethan mansion which had

sheltered the balcombes for genera-
tions

  the eleventh baronet slept peace-
fully in a swing chair in the cool
shadow of the tree his white head
bowed down
from cincinnati

                      and his strangely unexpected
                      visit to the haunted castle

  suddenly he stirred in his sleep
and opened his eyes with the con-
sciousness that he was not alone
blinking and a little irritable he
sat upright and saw that a stranger
was standing a few yards away from
him gravely contemplating the
house

  neither spoke for perhaps half a
minute when the stranger observ-
ing that sir john was awake said
i trust i did not disturb you sir

  not at all said the baronet
courteously

  as a matter of fact i only no-
ticed you sir john a moment or so
ago the other went on affably i
am an american-john saunders of
cincinnati

  indeed sir john replied and
sat upright

  and im afraid im trespassing in
your park the american went on
with a smile but im interested in
balcombe years ago my ancestors
came from this part of england you
see

  saunders the name is still
about here sir john said he was
now wide awake and watching the
stranger curiously he had a vague
feeling that he had seen him before

  i was on my way to the hall to
ask permission to look over it the
american volunteered he was en-
tirely at his ease

  wednesday is usually the day
the baronet pointed out but i
shall be happy to let you look
round seeing that you have come
so far

  old mansions are fascinating
particularly to one from my part of

the world where most things are
new sir john

  you know my name

  of course

  you might as well sit down said
sir john in a friendlier tone the
stranger had a pleasing manner and
was quite unlike his idea of an
american his accent did not jar-
indeed it was rather attractive-and
he seemed to be deeply interested in
the old house somehow the old
man felt drawn to him

  you were saying your ancestors
lived in balcombe sir john asked

  yes theres a gravestone in the
churchyard i reckon to be that of
my great-grandfather-ephraim
saunders of this parish

  the vicars a good fellow he
has all the parish records and im
sure hed turn them up for you the
baronet suggested

 thank you the american
smiled if i have time i will call
on him

  personally i havent a great deal
of use for the cloth sir john said
confidentially im a materialist
im afraid but they are part of the
tradition down here

  you surprise me sir i confess
ive always associated the english
landed gentry with the church
even so-the trend of modern
thought im afraid is to make one
more critical than of old

  quite

  but im keeping you talking and
you want to look at the hall come
along ill take you round myself
jevons the butler usually gets it
all mixed up anyway


astounding stories

  thats very good of you sir i
shall be very much obliged

  halfway up the broad staircase
sir john touched a secret panel and
revealed with dramatic suddenness
a long narrow corridor ending in
darkness the american started

  the haunted room laughed sir
john shall we go down to it
sure saunders replied ill
always try anything once

  the corridor led to an oak door
black with age which opened into
a small square unfurnished room
conveying an immediate impression
of eeriness

  thats all there is to it sir john
pointed out legends galore of
course skeletons and what not and
clanking chains in the small hours
im always comfortably asleep by
that time however personally i
dont believe a word of it

  if this room could speak- the

american said in a quiet voice as if
he had not heard what his host had
said its a strange thing sir john
but in my country thousands of
miles away from here im almost
certain that i have heard from my
own father one of the legends of
this very room

 is that so the baronet was
obviously surprised

 some distant ancestor of mine
had a daughter and she is supposed
to have been held prisoner in a se-
cret room in this house

 by one of my ruffianly ances-
tors sir john asked with a frankly
incredulous smile do you mean
that you-a modern american from
cincinnati-claim a share in my
ghost

  saunders smiled you evidently
dont attach any importance to the
legend at all sir john

  not a pennys worth this room
is rather stuffy dont you think
come-ill show you some of the

pictures there are legends clus-
tering around some of them of
course

 by the time sir john balcombe
and the citizen of cincinnati
emerged from the impressive dim-
ness of the elizabethan hall into the
garish sunlight of the lawn there
was an understanding between them
sir john liked the american there
was a freshness about him a naivete
he appeared to be far more im-
pressed with the legends of the hall
than was its owner

  its one of the loveliest places
ive seen sir john he said en-
thusiastically

  youd like to take it to america
ive read that its sometimes done
his host said with a laugh

 the american shook his head
you cant move a home sir john
it doesnt consist merely of bricks
and mortar besides what would
your ghost do i really cannot im-
agine an english one happy in-say
-cincinnati

  our ghost sir john corrected
him but as a matter of fact if
one attaches any importance to the
legends there are many ghosts at
balcombe

  oh im terribly interested-im
afraid youre not

  frankly im not im a materi-
alist as i told you i dont think
theres a word of truth in any of the
stories curiously enough my wife
does im sorry shes not in im
sure she would have told you about
them and moreover enjoyed doing
so one of the stories even more
absurd than the others is to the
effect that a certain ghost appears
to the head of the house before he
dies it is like a thousand other
legends in a thousand similar places
but our specimen has one peculiar-
ity the ghost never appears in the
same guise twice and always it is
the man from cincinnati



what one might call a contemporary
ghost as i told you i think the
whole story is so much moonshine

  it is a pity you are a materialist
these legends are simply wasted on
you

  sir john smiled indulgently the
american was really a pleasant fel-
low he appeared to have the credu-
lous innocence of a child and to be
unlike everything sir john had ever
read of his race

  its a pity my wife isnt here
sir john said again she knows
the whole story once i remember
the ghost was a postilion-that
would be before the railways of
course and another time it took
the form of a white-haired lawyer
that was in my grandfathers days
the old gentleman-my grandfa-
ther i mean not the lawyer-told
them on his deathbed that the law-
yer had been with him all the after-
noon what had happened of
course was that my grandfather had
dreamed about the lawyer but it
was enough for the credulous peo-
ple to seize on it and say there
you are the ghost and that
night he died it is obvious of
course that he would have died any-
way

  no one else saw the lawyer
the american asked

  no but if people want to be-
lieve in a ghost a detail like that
doesnt stop them

  its hardly fair on the ghost for
you to tell his story the american
said with a smile you dont give
him a chance sir john you could
have made the story sound far more
convincing

  i told you i thought it all moon-
shine when it appears to me ill
believe it im not prejudiced
really but until something happens
which i personally can test im
afraid im an unbeliever

  and you have never seen it

  no ive heard all sorts of queer
noises in the house at night but you
cant live in a place like this with-
out noises im quite certain that
every one of them admits of some
simple natural explanation

  its a lovely old place the amer-
ican said quietly he looked up at
the mellow red front the quaint
windows perhaps he was envious
for he seemed almost to sigh as he
turned to his host and now i must
be going sir john i thank you
for your kindness in receiving me
i shall take away the happiest memo-
ries of balcombe

  not at all good-by-good-by

  an hour later lady balcombe
dignified and austere returned from
a round of visits

  jevons the butler stood within
the shadow of the hall as she en-
tered he had been with the family
for forty years

  my lady he said as his mistress
came up the broad steps

  yes jevons

  you will forgive me-but sir
john has not been himself this aft-
ernoon

  what do you mean jevons she
asked in surprise

  hes been acting very queer my
lady walking all over the house
talking to himself

  lady balcombe glanced sharply at
the butler but remained silent

  he was talking just as if there
was some one with him my lady

  and he was alone she asked in
her quiet voice

  yes

  she breathed deeply

  where is your master i will go
to him

  they found sir john where he
would have wished to be found-
underneath the old cedar tree shel-
tered from the sun
above them the heavens
were filled with a savage
glory

a story of the second dimension by

wallace west

i cant understand it said doc-
tor adolph strauss nervously
polishing the eyepiece of the
five-inch telescope which he had set
up in the garden behind his little
drug store yesterday i saw that
comet yerkes and flagstaff ob-
servatories corroborated my discov-
ery the new york papers gave the
story half a column with my pic-
ture to-night the comet isnt in
sight

  poor dad said his son frank
who was lying on his back in the
grass staring up at the darkening
plane people

              the razor-edged planet hurled itself
              at the earth like a buzz saw

sky i can see to-morrows head-
lines amateur astronomers comet
a hoax doctor strausss discov-
ery discredited ouch

 its no laughing matter the
rotund physician whirled upon his
progeny if ive been mistaken
the president of the amateur astro-
nomical association will-

  yeh i know frank rose lazily
to his six feet two and yawned the
a a a will brand you for a pub-
licity-seeking bungler well guess
its time to relieve marie at the soda
fountain i sure will be glad when
this lousy vacation is over and i can
start football practice

  behind the counter was marie a
pretty girl despite her too-tight
dress and ridiculous spike-heeled
shoes soft golden hair and clear
blue eyes set off a pert tip-tilted
nose

 lo frank she relinquished
her post behind the faucets ill be
back for the eight-oclock rush
dont work too hard

  frank went into the back room to
gossip with bert wheeler the pre-
scription clerk a lean pale youth
who nourished ambitions of becom-
ing a physician and marrying marie
the two were soon deep in a dis-
cussion of end runs and interfer-
ence when the front door slammed
violently

 frank bert marie called
theres something enormous in the
sky come out quick

 at the same moment doctor
strauss flushed and shaken thrust
his head in the back door

 i was right after all the

comet its right on us coming
at terrific speed and its flat-like
a pancake thats why i couldnt
see it the head vanished

  the governors gone nutty this
time sure said frank hes go-
ing to have a comet named after him
if he has to manufacture the darned
thing

  outside however franks hand-
some face went white at the amaz-
ing spectacle from horizon to ze-
nith the eastern sky was split by a
brilliant white line as he stared
this vanished to reappear as an elon-
gated oval then it thinned to a
hair line once more

  what is it dad he asked

  dont know its like a pie plate
big as the earth what we see is
its wabbling edge its coming
straight at us the collision will
split the earth like an apple he
turned back to the telescope

  oh god frank heard the old
man praying in this my last mo-
ment-

  the words were drowned by a hiss
similar to that heard when a whip
is cracked this grew to a million
whips then transcended sound alto-
gether the line of light flashed
downward like the edge of a sword

 frank recovered con-
sciousness and sat up holding his
aching head his whole body shook
as though he held the terminals of
an electric vibrator for a moment
he thought he was still in the gar-
den there was the telescope
sprawling by its fallen tripod be-
side it doctor strauss was lying


astounding stories

his open mouth and unconscious
staring eyes revealed in the moon-
light a little distance away marie
had crumpled up her silk dress in
tatters near her bert sprawled like
a fallen scarecrow

  but there was something wrong
the fence surrounding the garden
was in ruins while of the houses
which should have bordered the
street outside there was not a trace
turning he looked toward the drug
store to find it converted into a heap
of tangled lumber as though it had
been struck by a giant hammer

  and there was something wrong
with the moonlight which revealed
all this it was of a peculiar green-
ish blue which caused frank to lift
his eyes with a bound that would
have done him credit on the grid-
iron he then came to his feet with
a shout of pure panic the green
light was coming not from any
moon he knew but from a great
globe which spun across the heav-
ens like an airplane

  dad bert marie he yelled
his heart thumping with terror
wake up theres something
wrong with the moon

  then the awful thought occurred
to him that perhaps the others were
dead an icy hand seemed to close
around his heart it relaxed how-
ever when the doctor stirred sat
up rubbed his eyes stared at the
strange sky then scrambled toward
his beloved telescope

  for a long moment there was dead
silence while frank rummaged
through his pockets for cigarettes
and found none finally his father
turned to him with a face suddenly
drawn and wan

  thats not the moon frank
thats the earth

  whats it mean dad

  frank had unearthed a single
crumpled fag from an inside pocket

and was lighting it with trembling
fingers

  it means that weve been carried
off on strausss comet the little
man could not resist giving their
strange habitation his own name it
probably impinged only slightly on
the earth scooping us off as you
would take a cherry off the top of
a sundae with a spoon

  frank started to walk across to
the two other forms only to dis-
cover that his progress was slow and
clumsy as though he were climbing
a steep hill yet the ground was
perfectly flat-flatter than he had
imagined ground could be-and cov-
ered so far as the eye could reach
with a dense lichenous vegetation
into which his feet sank as into a
persian rug

  berts thin frame and sallow face
looked even more ineffectual than
usual under the green earthlight
frank leaned over and shook him
half contemptuously poor devil
what a shock hed get as the phar-
macist moaned and showed signs of
recovering frank turned his atten-
tion to marie

  without the mask of pertness be-
hind which she always had hidden
the girl was much more charming
than he had ever seen her her red
lips were parted showing fine white
teeth one rounded shoulder
gleamed provocatively through her
torn dress even in the relaxation
of unconsciousness her figure
showed long graceful lines

  oh how funny and green you
look marie had opened her eyes
and was struggling to sit up realiz-
ing her half-naked condition
what hit us i feel as if id been
through a washing machine got a
cigarette i need one badly

  only this one have a whiff it
probably will be your last he re-
gretfully relinquished the butt
plane people



were off on a comet a la jules
verne the governor wasnt so
crazy after all can you stand up
oh yes she seemed unable to
grasp the astounding news as yet
hello bert you look as though
youd been dragged by a horse

 but bert was far beyond caring
how he looked he alone seemed
aware of the hopelessness of their
position his lips were blue his
eyes rolled wildly

 what have i done he moaned
what have i done im going to
die and i dont want to he began
to laugh hysterically until frank
shook him back into sanity

 who says were going to die
buck up old man lets go talk to
the governor come on marie
frank held out his hand and
thrilled to the firm cool touch of
hers as he assisted her to rise

  their return to the doctor was an-
other surprise although it looked
level the ground now seemed to
slant sharply they were forced to
fight against the tendency to break
into a run and only stopped beside
the doctor by digging their heels
into the turf

 say what is this demanded
frank sitting down because it
seemed easier than standing against
that invisible pull

 i dont know boy then a
speculative light in his nearsighted
blue eyes his father added when
i was at the fairs they had a big
wheel which spun round and round
you got on the wheel and if you
stayed near the center you could
hold on but if you slipped to the
edge off you went well this
comet is very thin and perfectly flat
like a phonograph record its
whirling at a terrific rate as you can
see by the spiral motion of the
earth up there centrifugal force
accounts for its being easy to walk

in one direction and hard in an-
other

  which is all perfectly lovely
countered marie but what i want
to know is how and when do we
eat

  all you think of is eating bert
interrupted now youve made me
hungry

  this grass has berries on it said
frank he picked a handful of a
waxen fruit hm-m-m dont
taste bad

  they may poison us marie sug-
gested

  now see here bert looked as
if he were going to be ill thats
no way to talk kiddings all right
at the store-but this is serious
scaredy cat marie sniffed as she
watched frank still eating and fol-
lowed his example

 the pharmic glared at her and
muttered under his breath his dor-
mant jealousy was awakening rap-
idly

 what do we do next asked
frank after a long silence

  i dont know confessed the doc-
tor his head in his hands its out-
side my experience and its going
to rain soon too he added staring
at a low bank of mist or cloud which
was sweeping over the ground to-
ward them from what they consid-
ered the axis or up side of the
country we ought to find shel-
ter i suppose

  lets start walking up then
better bring the telescope along
you can carry the tripod and bert
can bring the tube

 hey how about you carrying
something bert protested and
who gave you the right to issue or-
ders anyway

 well somebody had to take
charge

 how about consulting me-us-
first we ought to draw lots


astounding stories

thats the way they do in desert-

island stories

  sometimes they fight it out for
the leadership want to do that
franks voice was cold

  aw say now im no fighter
all right then frank slipped
one hand under maries arm and
lifted her to her feet the pharmic
choked with rage but made no fur-
ther protest

  but wouldnt it be much easier
to walk down objected the girl
after a few minutes laborious trudg-
ing against the centrifugal pull and
the wind

  sure replied frank but if
dads theory is correct the farther
down we go the easier the going
will get until well be running and
cant stop and are swept right off
the edge of the planet like a spark
from an emery wheel no wed
better go up the pull should be-
come less as we advance

 the clouds were pouring toward
them in a tumbled mass and after
half an hours travel the rain com-
menced but it was like no rain
they knew instead it resembled a
barrage of machine-gun bullets fly-
ing almost parallel to the ground
and was accompanied by a gale
which stopped their progress like
an outthrust hand

 marie whimpered but struggled
valiantly on her tiny spike heels
sinking into the tundra her perma-
nent wave only a memory frank
looked at her with a new respect and
growing admiration and tried to aid
her as best he could

  bert was the first to quit the un-
equal struggle dropping the tele-
scope he lay on his face behind that
slight shelter and cursed savagely

  since no rock or hill offered shel-
ter on the mist-enshrouded plain
frank also stopped directed his fa-
ther to sit with his back to the rain

slumped down beside him and
pushed marie into the shelter
formed by their bodies on earth
the girl would have been unprotected
from the rain but here because of
its almost horizontal path she was
fairly dry the back of her pro-
tectors ached with the smart of the
lashing drops while little rivulets
flowed from behind them and trick-
led down on the drug clerk

  how long do you think we can
hold out frank whispered to his
father as soon as he saw that marie
completely exhausted had fallen
asleep

  two or three days unless we can
find shelter or light a fire

  say dad-the youth found his
parents wrinkled hand and squeezed
it gently-ive treated you pretty
badly at times and im sorry youre
a good scout

  lets forget it then the old
mans voice quavered i was too
old when you were born to under-
stand you im afraid

 hours later as the green
earth was plunging over the edge of
the planet the sun rose over the
other rim and started a rapid spiral
toward the zenith miraculously the
rain stopped the crawling clouds
evaporated and the wind died away

  dripping and exhausted the four
started forlornly about them over
the unbroken plain marie had
awakened with a violent chill while
the doctor had developed a hacking
cough

  weve got to have a fire an-
nounced frank whos got a
match mine are all gone

  the doctor produced a few sticks
from which the heads had melted

  bert rummaged through his pock-
ets but fared no better

  frank looked inquiringly at
marie
plane people



  where do you think id carry a
match in this rig she laughed hug-
ging her knees and trying to still
her chattering teeth im as naked
as the girls on the lipstick calen-
dars she added to show that sho
had not lost courage

  how about the telescope lens as
a sunglass then this moss is dry-
ing out rapidly

  chagrined that he had not thought
o this before the doctor unscrewed
the glass only a few minutes were
required to create a tiny blaze
around which they dried themselves
and regained some of their spirits

  all right lets go frank real-
ized that to sit still meant death in
this barren land marie clung to his
arm laughed at all his jokes and
did not try to hide the look of ado-
ration in her eyes

 although only two hours had
passed the sun had reached the
zenith and the heat had grown op-
pressive when they came across a
path in the tundra which made the
going somewhat easier this track
was narrow but it ran in the direc-
tion they were taking and proved a
godsend for marie whose pretty
shoes had become mere pulpy
masses

  at least there is some sort of
animal life in this strange world
the doctor said maybe we wont
starve after all

  hardly had he spoken when frank
motioned him to be quiet

 food in sight some kind of
creature up ahead

  deploying to right and left they
crept forward soon a bright-green
object could be plainly seen coming
down the path frank gripped the
tripod their only weapon and
crouched hoping the peculiar thing
would not see him the more they
advanced the more extraordinary
their prey appeared seen close at

hand it resembled a gigantic sole
or flounder being flat as a pancake
and evidently propelling itself by
extending and retracting its under
side in the head portion were two
narrow eyes and a wide mouth which
worked continuously the thing
plainly was endeavoring to escape
from some pursuit and took no no-
tice of its new peril it was on the
point of scrambling past the humans
when frank swung his tripod it
took two blows to dispatch the crea-
ture and between the first and sec-
ond it set up a shocking squeal
which set their teeth on edge it
was almost human

 get out the glass dad well
have dinner right now frank held
up the catch which looked ex-
actly like a dusty fish

 their preparations were inter-
rupted however by a peculiar high-
pitched humming which increased
rapidly from the direction which
they had agreed to call up the hill

  more of them reported frank
shading his eyes from the sun
might as well lay up a supply for
the winter

  but the creatures which now came
scooting down the path were of an
arrestingly different nature from the
fish they had just killed bert took
one look at them and beat a hasty
retreat even frank paled as he mo-
tioned marie and his father to stand
behind him and poised the tripod for
action

 the newcomers were about six
feet long and two broad and were
equipped with innumerable arms or
legs which extended from their
spiny sides like those of centipedes
but the most amazing thing about
the creatures was that for all their
length and width they could not
have been more than an inch or two
thick in fact they looked like
dreadful animated ribbons on the


astounding stories

dusty path as they shot along at
race-horse speed

  it was their heads however which
bothered frank most somehow
they looked weirdly human as
though the skull of a man had been
run intact through a clothes wringer
the flattened eyes were there the
protruding nose and square chin
coasting only a fraction of an inch
above the ground and the crea-
tures were spaced evenly along the
track as though in some intelligent
formation

  they give me the jitters whis-
pered marie who stood her ground
determined to shame bert for his
cowardly retreat that first one
looks like lee wong the laundry-
man

  shut up frank realized their
grave danger only too well they
may hear us dont move theyre
watching the path and may not see
us

  for a few seconds it did look as
though they would escape for the
flat things paid no attention to them
but swept down the path without
hesitation until they came to the
pool of blood where frank had
killed the fish

 here they stopped-there were
five of them in all-and held what
looked to be a hurried conference
they seemed to use long antenna
which sprouted from their faces like
mustaches as some sort of a means
of communication

  coming out of their huddle they
began to explore the sides of the
path while the humans held their
breath in agonized stillness one of
the things at last came upon berts
footprints and scuttled along them
in pursuit

 the pharmic who had stopped
after running several hundred yards
saw his pursuer coming and let out
a yell of terror as he began another

sprint he had not gone a hundred
yards when he was overtaken
frank saw him lift one foot to tram-
ple the hideous head into the ground
the next instant he screamed in
agony as a sheet of red light shot
along the ground toward him an
instant later he plunged sidewards
into the moss

 frank help theyve done
something to my feet come kill
the damned thing ow theyre
murdering me he wailed like a
small child

 but frank was unable to help
the remaining flat things at last
had discovered him and his compan-
ions and surrounded them as though
waiting for a hostile move

  tentatively frank thrust the end
of the tripod at one of them a
flash of flame burst from some in-
strument held in the forward claw
of the one marie had called lee
wong the end of the tripod fused
and melted away

 franks flesh crawled at the
thought of the tortures which prob-
ably lay before them at the hands
of these monstrous beings the
thought flashed through his mind
that perhaps it would be wisest to
slay marie and the doctor with the
tripod before they could be cap-
tured then his natural optimism
revived and he determined to meet
the situation with a smile no mat-
ter what the future might hold

  phew he groaned trying to be
comic despite his dry throat now
whats to do mustnt monkey with
these babies theyre poison all
right old boy he added bowing to
the one who appeared to be the
leader whats next on your
snaky highnesss program

 for answer the flame much di-
minished in power swung until it
struck his right foot instantly the
leather of his shoe became painfully

            ast-
plane people



hot frank lifted the foot and stood
dubiously on one leg like a crane
the beam did not travel upward as
he had expected but shifted to the
other foot perforce he stood on
the right leg and lifted the left

  reminds me of those old stories
about how western gunmen made
their victims dance by shooting at
their feet maybe thats what he
wants he executed a few steps
which disconcerted the enemy as
much as if he had vanished into
thin air he and his companions
went into another huddle feelers
touching exactly like a group of
football players confronted by some
unexpected strategy by the oppos-
ing team

  in his dance frank had moved
several yards up the path when
the leader of the flat people returned
to the attack the ray was much di-
minished in power tentatively the
youth made a step down the road
the power of the ray increased ago-
nizingly he retreated and it faded
once more

  looks as if they were inviting
you to pay them a visit marie sug-
gested through white lips she and
the doctor had not yet been discov-
ered although they stood in plain
sight only a few feet off the path

  a renewed bellowing from bert
made them glance in his direction
the clerk had arisen and was hob-
bling frantically toward them prod-
ded by a shaft of light

  come on then frank could
not help laughing at the ridiculous-
ness of their dilemma although he
was casting desperately about in his
mind for some means of escape
might as well humor them theyll
kill us without a qualm if we dont
hey dad come out of it this is
no time to be day-dreaming

  so herded like cattle with the
mysterious ray ready to inflict pain-

  ast-

ful punishment each time they devi-
ated from the path the four dispir-
ited humans plodded up the lane all
of them with the exception of bert
trying to pretend that the experi-
ence was only a lark franks heart
swelled with pride at maries grit
and his hand sought hers

 for a long while the doctor
seemed sunk in thought as though
he were trying to solve a difficult
problem hands behind his back he
hurried along then he cleared his
throat and touched franks arm

  i once had a mathematics pro-
fessor who held that life was pos-
sible in two dimensions as well as
three

  meaning what

  why im just wondering these
devils seemed startled out of their
wits every time you jumped into the
air and notice their eyes they
move from side to side but never
up and down frankly-he leaned
closer and whispered the words as
though afraid of being overheard-
i doubt if they know the meaning
of up and down at all and if thats
so-

  during the last few hours frank
had stopped regarding his fathers
aueer theories with condescension
the young man was growing up rap-
idly and his smart-alec attitude was
being succeeded by thoughtful con-
sideration

  do you think that gives us a
chance to escape perhaps if i-

  dont do anything rash boy
they dont seem really hostile and
im confident theyre highly intelli-
gent probably theyre taking us to
their headquarters since we would
be dead of exposure in a weeks time
wed better go along without mak-
ing any disturbance i only wish
there was some way of communicat-
ing with them his scientific en-
thusiasm had superseded fear


astounding stories

  they talk with their feelers
that lets us out

  im not so sure of that lets
wait and see

  marie had been stumbling along
on bare feet around which she had
wrapped strips from her tattered
dress at this point in the conver-
sation she stepped on a sharp stone
and would have fallen had not
frank picked her up in his arms

  this action set their captors in a
furor they deployed right and
left in search of the girl and it was
several minutes before they gave up
the search and returned to prod the
other captives onward when
frank set the girl on her feet a
quarter of an hour later the crea-
tures again were thrown into a near
panic and went into their custom-
ary huddle to discuss the matter

  if we could climb a tree theyd
lose us completely predicted the
doctor as soon as we leave the
ground we cease to exist for them
but there were no trees-only the
endless plain

 the sun had spiraled across
the sky twice and the earth and
moon now diminished to pygmy
dimensions by the onward flight of
the comet had followed it thrice
when they caught sight of a curi-
ous formation on the ground half a
mile ahead

  unquestionably it was a city but
a city such as they had never
dreamed of along broad radiating
avenues were multitudes of what
appeared to be open-topped five-
sided boxes in and out of these
it could be seen as they approached
were moving thousands of the thin
people engaged in the pursuit of
business and pleasure the sides of
these houses were only three or four
inches high and painted in brilliant
contrasting colors it was to be ob-

served also that the edges of the
inhabitants were of the same color
as their houses that is a family
of five or six red thinsies as
marie had now dubbed them would
inhabit a house of the same color
while near at hand a green house
would be full of grass-tinted mon-
strosities

  they paint their visible portions
to aid in recognition the doctor
suggested you will notice that
the tops of their bodies are a uni-
form dull white

 they wont have to paint us
marie still tried to maintain her flip
attitude although it was wearing
rather thin in spots and allowing a
very frightened little girl to peep
through well join the red tribe
were sunburned like tomatoes

  the arrival of the humans created
a sensation in the town great
crowds of the creatures gathered
along the sides of the streets to
watch their progress and the shrill
humming which seemed an attribute
of all of them rose until it all but
deafened the newcomers

 but unlike human crowds this
one remained orderly and let frank
and his companions pass through a
narrow lane in the midst of the
thoroughfare

  bert was in an ecstasy of terror
as the thousands of long feelers
brushed his feet more than once
frank had to steady him as he
stumbled and would have stepped
into the midst of the throng

 easy old man he warned the
pharmic whose eyes flitted about
continually seeking some way of
escape theyve got our number
buck up well come out all right

  ill never get out of here alive
berts teeth were chattering if
theyd only look up at us maybe
wed have a chance ow take that
devil off an impatient guard an-
plane people



noyed at his hesitancy had prodded
his heel with the ray

  shut up bert snapped marie
whose nerves were stretched tight
why dont you act like a man
franks not afraid

  havent time for that frank
gripped wheelers trembling arm
and yanked him forward as he saw
signs of a disastrous panic lets
get out of here before we step on
a few heads and get burned to
death

  straight through the city which
except for its brilliant and barbaric
coloring presented a strangely de-
pressing appearance they were
herded toward an immense polygo-
nal structure in the mathematical
center of the converging streets

  here a conclave already was gath-
ering to receive them they per-
ceived long lines of the thin crea-
tures most of them painted a bril-
liant yellow pouring through the
many doors and ranging themselves
in well-spaced order inside

  might as well put on a show to
impress them with our supernatural
powers said the doctor as they ap-
proached the walls of this building
remember that we present a totally
different aspect to them when we
sit down lie down place our hands
on the ground and so on if we
make enough changes perhaps
theyll decide that we are old men
of the sea and treat us with re-
spect

  suiting the action to the word he
stepped over the pygmy wall and
followed by his companions
threaded his way between the rows
of thunderstruck spectators until he
reached a wide cleared space in the
center of the building

 their guards dashed wildly
around the outside of the hall as
completely at a loss as an earthly
policeman would have been if his

prisoner had walked through a brick
wall

  meanwhile in the center of the
auditorium the humans were per-
forming strange antics in unison
they kneeled down rolled over
danced stood on one leg and per-
formed similar feats while a swell-
ing hum of astonishment from the
spectators told them that their ef-
forts were creating a sensation

  when the assemblage was hum-
ming and hissing like a collection of
dynamos a squad of red-painted
guards at last pushed their way to
the center of the floor and leveled
their weapons at the earth men in-
stantly the latter stood still ap-
parently this was considered a sign
of surrender at any rate the com-
motion diminished and the jammed
exits were cleared

  at last when perfect silence had
been restored a vermilion person-
age surrounded by a heavy guard
hesitantly approached the captives
tentatively it thrust out its two-
foot-long feelers toward bert the
boy kicked out and stumbled back
in dismay for a moment it looked
as though the personage intended to
order his guards to destroy them
franks tongue clove to the roof of
his mouth and a cold sweat broke
out on the palms of his hands

  then the yellow leader turned its
attention to doctor strauss who had
advanced and stood unflinchingly in
front of the others it must be un-
derstood that the doctors thin shoes
long ago had disintegrated until now
his toes stuck through the leather
and stared back at the thinsie which
inspected them after some hesita-
tion the creature rested its feelers
upon the exposed digits

  a look of amazement was born
and grew on the doctors round face

  its talking to me he exclaimed
some sort of thought transference


astounding stories

which only becomes operative
through physical contact hes
apologizing for the rudeness with
which we were welcomed

  a burst of hyterical laughter in-
terrupted his explanation maries
control at last had snapped

  oh the doctors talking with his
toes shake toes with the rulers of
thinland doctor theyre just
plane people this is worse than
alice in wonderland tears
trickled from her eyes and she at
last was forced to sit down on the
floor where she rocked back and
forth to the vast astonishment of
the concourse

 this is no time for nonsense
marie strauss warned her sternly

 look look she choked
that red fellow has placed his feel-
ers on thinsies tail and the next
guard has connected with him see
all the creatures are in contact
theyre listening in on your conver-
sation doctor dont tell any state
secrets oh frank make me stop
laughing i-i cant she was cry-
ing now with dry jerking sobs

  realizing that she was going into
a real fit of hysterics frank lifted
the girl to her feet shook her gen-
tly at first and then more vigorously
until her teeth rattled and her sobs
ceased

 when they glanced back at
strauss they observed that the old
mans face was at once blank and
tense as though he were trying to
talk for the first time with a me-
chanical larynx

 here take hold of my hand
frank you too bert and marie
he commanded i want you to hear
whats going on and maybe help me
out in the pinches this is all new
these people think so differently
from us that even their thought
waves sometimes mean nothing to
me

  he extended his hand as he spoke
frank grasped it and gasped as a
shock ran up his arm and through
his whole being instantly he was
in tune with the strangest conversa-
tion of his life

  most illustrious sir-the words
formed distinctly in franks brain
like smoke rising through wet
leaves-you will excuse my for-
wardness in touching you but this
arises not from an ignorance of the
usages of polite society but from
your apparent inability to under-
stand the spoken word your lord-
ship is so peculiar in appearance-
five ovals connected to a much
larger oval-that before we enter
into further communications may i
beg you to satisfy the curiosity of
one who desires deeply to know
when his visitor came and how he
is able to change his shape at will
i come from space sir the
doctors words came distinctly to his
son although the little astronomers
lips had not moved

  pardon me my lord but is not
your lordship now in space as he
converses with me king toko of
umenia even at this moment
would your majesty be kind
enough to define space

 my lord space is length and
breadth prolonged to infinity every
one knows that

  you are wrong sir strauss an-
swered you imagine space as hav-
ing two dimensions only i come
from a land of three dimensions-
height breadth and length

  the king was quiet for a long mo-
ment as though trying to digest this
amazing information

  would your lordship condescend
to explain in what position is his
third dimension height

 it is up above and down be-
low

  my lord means that it is toward
plane people

dont move they
can bum you to a cin-
der with those little
tubes they have

and away from the center of ume-
nia

  not in the least i mean a direc-
tion in which you cannot look be-
cause your eyes are not made to look
other than to the left and right in
order to perceive space you should
have an eye on your upper side
that is on what you would call your
inside

  an eye on my inside you jest

not so replied the doctor
adopting the stately manner of the
kings utterances i tell you i
come from the land of three dimen-
sions i can look down upon the
plane of umenia and discern the in-
side of all you call solid i can see
that fifty guards are now patrolling
the outside of this building i can
discern the contents of yonder
strong box in which are stored many
documents permit me to bring one
of them to you

 a buzz of terrified astonishment
greeted this announcement this
was intensified to a shrill scream


astounding stories

from the thousand onlookers as the
doctor marched to the great box in
the center of the amphitheater
lifted an inscribed tablet through its
open top and a moment later placed
it before the king

  truly you are a magician mut-
tered the monarch

  not at all the doctor now be-
gan to show his usual impatience
you locked the box but that did
not prevent my reaching through its
top-that which you call its inside-
and bringing proof of my powers
this is due to the fact that you live
upon a plane what you style ume-
nia is a vast level surface upon
which you and your countrymen
move about without rising above it
or falling below my shape is not
that of five ovals connected to a
larger oval that is only the edge
of what i call my foot in fact i
am not a plane figure but a solid
made up of an infinite number of
circles squares and other geometric
figures placed on top of one another
i am a creature called man my
name is adolph strauss

 you talk in riddles adolph-
strauss

 behind another proof then
commanded the doctor i will lift
my foot slowly order your
guardsmen to hold it

  the king did so instantly six red
thinsies leaped forward

 wc have him they shouted
no yes we have him still hes
going hes gone their thin
arms waved back and forth impo-
tently as the doctor stood on one
leg and winked at his fascinated son
then perceiving the other foot
they flung themselves upon it and
shouted their victory as the king
crawled up to make inspection

  but this is not the same person
said the baffled monarch or
rather it is as if he had turned him-

self inside out see the largest of
the five small ovals is on the right
side instead of the left

  that is my other foot the doc-
tor explained i lifted the first foot
into the third dimension now are
you convinced

  poor king toko was at his wits
end he broke contact and con-
ferred hastily with his sages one
of these a decrepit creature with
mathematical leanings asked to take
up the questioning

  tell me mr mathematician re-
sumed the doctor when the thought
current had been restored if a point
moves toward the center of umenia
leaving a luminous wake what name
would you give to the wake that it
would leave

  a straight line of course was
the haughty reply

  and if the straight line moved
sidewise parallel to itself what
name would you give the figure
thereby formed

  a square

  now stretch your imagination a
bit and conceive a square moving
parallel to itself upward

  what toward the planets cen-
ter

 no no upward out of umenia
altogether i mean that every point
in your-that is to say in what you
call your inside-is to pass upward
through space in such a way that
no point shall pass through the po-
sition previously occupied by any
other point but each point shall de-
scribe a straight line of its own
and what may be the nature of
the figure which i am to shape the
mathematician floundered

  you will generate a solid which
will be bounded by six sides-that
is to say six of your insides you
see it all now eh

  but at that point the mathemati-
cian went violently insane and had
plane people



to be removed screaming from the
hall

  the king it developed was no
quitter he once more took his place
by the doctors side and begged fur-
ther enlightenment

  be thou juggler enchanter
dream or devil i will make yet an-
other effort to comprehend the mean-
ing of your lordships words he
said yet i must confess that i
cannot grasp your reasoning

  why dont you lift him off the
ground dad frank queried
that should convince the damned
idiot

  king toko caught the meaning of
this remark although luckily not
its disparaging tone and shuddered
throughout the yellow length of
him

  lift me out of space he cried
no never my people would not
permit you to lay hands on my royal
person

  how about one of your council-
lors then suggested frank

  the king thought deeply for sev-
eral minutes finally he replied

  very well lift puro my secre-
tary of state he is old and feeble
and if he dies there will be no great
loss

  but the sage in question had no
intention of being made the sub-
ject of any experiment wildly he
scuttled toward an exit and was
only captured as he was leaving the
building

 brought back he hummed and
shivered in a very nightmare of ter-
ror until a sharp command from the
king silenced him then like a lamb
to the slaughter he crept forward
to his doom

  overcoming his distaste for the
creature frank gripped the ribbon-
like sides and hoisted mightily
puro was surprisingly light for his
size and came away from the ground

like a feather for a moment his
slit eyes closed and frank feared
that he had died of fright then
his eyes slitted open and his excited
buzzing threw the whole auditorium
into another uproar

  either this is madness or it is
hell frank caught the thought vi-
brations as the poor fellow squeezed
his eyes shut once more

  it is neither said the doctor
it is knowledge it is three dimen-
sions open your eyes again and
tell what you see

  slowly puro complied the hall
was hushed as he began to speak

  it is a new world he chattered
i see the inside of this creature
which has lifted me yet i can see no
heart nor lungs nor arteries only
a beautiful harmonious something
i see a space that is not space i
sec what i had considered my own
inside and yet it is not my inside
i see both the inside and outside of
this amphitheater even as the stran-
ger has described it i see the in-
side of the strong box i see the
interiors of houses in the city be-
hold i have become a god i puro
whose death o king you just said
was of little importance

 set him down he grows blas-
phemous commanded toko i be-
lieve  strangers you shall have the
freedom of the city and shall teach
me and my people the secrets of the
thing you call space a holiday
shall be declared in your honor and
you shall want for nothing so long
as you remain with us

  frank did as he was bid and old
puro dazed by his experience crept
away to cogitate in one corner of
the hall

 then began a period of ex-
istence which was like heaven to the
castaways after the privations they
had suffered while roaming the


astounding stories

plain their every wish was
granted they lived on the fat of
the land-strange vegetables like
flat beans and carrots steaks from
the fishlike creatures which the thin-
sies herded like cattle and which
also provided a thick milk

  the doctor set up his battered
telescope near the little hut which
they had constructed near the palace
and made endless calculations as to
the speed and orbit of the comet on
which they rode he clung desper-
ately to the hope that they sometime
might return to earth but admitted
frankly that there was not one
chance in a billion of their doing
so in technical language hard for
the others to understand he ex-
plained that the comet in colliding
with the earth had been thrown into
a parabolic orbit around the sun
which sometime might bring it back
to a similar juxtaposition with its
heavenly neighbor he talked of
paralaxes relativity and space time
as glibly as though he understood
all about them and only franks
caustic comments could bring him
back to consideration of things
nearer at hand

  apparently there was little to sup-
port his theory the earth became
smaller and smaller until it ap-
peared only as a bright star with the
moon a tiny speck beside it they
approached the orbit of venus un-
til that planet grew to the size of
a dinner plate and then receded as
their wabbling phonograph disk
swept into the outer reaches of
space but the spiraling sun and
the days and nights of four hours
each continued unchanged and
every night the driving bulletlike
rain lashed umenia with a thousand
whips and every day the heat stifled
them

  the kings sages came to them
cach day and the doctor spent hours

in trying to open up to them the
vast reaches of three-dimensional
existence marie and frank joined
in this work as best they could

  well marie frank asked one
day after she had been explaining to
the king himself methods of prepar-
ing food on earth do you think
you could teach the old boy to mix
a cherry soda

  i might she laughed if i could
only make him understand what a
faucet is hes promised to send
some of his metal workers so that
we may show them how to make
pipes and boxes and other high
things as he calls them she bus-
ied herself tidying her growing hair
before the big lens from the tele-
scope

  lately bert had started taking
long solitary walks outside the city
walls to relieve his boredom and
brood over his troubles his excuse
was that he did this because he hated
the sight of the thinsies only that
morning however frank on a jaunt
of his own had come upon the other
in close conversation with puro the
secretary of state who had been ele-
vated at the auditorium

 you dont seem to fear puro
much he now remarked recalling
that strange sight

  aw i was afraid the thing would
burn me if i didnt talk but his
little eyes shifted back and forth

  frank thought no more of this
conversation until the next day
when he was starting across the city
limits to examine a formation not
far away which the doctor believed
might contain gold

  when he reached the city wall
however he found a squad of red
quardsmen drawn up to block his
progress their vicious-looking ray
guns were held at ready and they
plainly meant business

 bending down he touched the
plane people



feelers of the commander and de-
manded an explanation

  the king has issued an order that
no humans are to be allowed outside
of the city was the sharp retort
you must ask him the reason

  furious yet frightened by this un-
expected shadow upon their idyllic
existence frank hurried back to
their house and reported the circum-
stance to his father

  the doctors face went white as
he listened

  i cant understand it he said
has this whole thing been a trick
to lull us into security are these
creatures really as heartless as they
look come he pulled on the
tatters which remained of his coat
we are lost if we accept this indig-
nity without complaint let us go
to toko at once

 the king welcomed them in the
throne room as though nothing had
happened but when they demanded
an explanation he moved his feelers
uncertainly stammered and sput-
tered as though he were ashamed of
what he had done but refused to lift
the embargo

 but what have we done to de-
serve such an indignity shouted
the doctor forgetting that the mon-
arch could only understand his
thought waves

  if a umenian shrug had been pos-
sible toko would have shrugged

  it has been brought to my atten-
tion that you are planning to escape
from my city he said at last i
find your instructions so invaluable
that i do not intend to let you go
i have spoken so saying he re-
moved his antennas from the doc-
tors toe as an indication that the
audience had ended

  well what do you make of it
frank asked as they left the spa-
cious pen which served toko for a
palace

  could it be that bert was trying
to run away when the secretary of
state caught him the doctor asked
i gave him credit for more sense
than that theres no place to escape
where he would not starve to death
in a week

  however bert violently denied
that he had endeavored to escape
rather unnecessarily he cursed
puro and at the same time begged
his companions to respect the kings
orders to the letter

  i tell you well all be burned he
whimpered im not going outside
the house

  after this incident life went on
as usual except that now a shadow
of fear hung over them although
the sages came for instruction as
usual and treated them with stately
courtesy the humans felt that they
were being toyed with and when
their usefulness had ceased or they
had offended against the mysterious
laws of the country they would be
put out of the way without com-
punction at least marie frank
and his father were gripped by this
unrelenting fear strangely enough
bert after a few days broke his
resolution of staying at home and
once more started his roaming he
swore that he never left the city
even when he had a chance to evade
the guards but frank once caught
him cleaning his cracked shoes of
what looked suspiciously like coun-
try mud

  the days arent so bad marie
once remarked after a week of this
harrowing existence then we can
see the creatures coming if they at-
tack us its the nights that frighten
me sometime when were asleep
theyll come slithering over the
floor and that will be the end of us
nonsense wheelers courage
caused them to cast surprised
glances in his direction the flat-


astounding stories

landers never go out when its rain-
ing were perfectly safe at night

 sunlight that filtered
through the thatch awakened frank
early one morning bert already had
gone out but the doctor still snored
heavily worn out by his studies

  the boy arose from his hard moss
bed drew on what few clothes were
left to him and tapped lightly on
the screen which divided maries
room from that of the men

  there was no answer

 he knocked more loudly and
called still no answer his heart
filled with a nameless fear he
pushed aside the rickety door and
looked in then gasped in amaze-
ment

 the moss of which marie had
made her bed was scattered all over
the floor the few articles which
she had collected to adorn the walls
were likewise in disarray a great
hole was torn in the flimsy outside
wall while a strip of fiber rope lay
in the middle of the room he
stared around fearfully

  marie  he shouted wildly know-
ing there would be no answer
where are you

  his heart beat heavily and his
fists doubled to meet he knew not
what menace could it be that the
thinsies creeping silently in on their
captives had carried off marie and
bert for some evil purpose and with-
out waking the others

  but his love for the girl overcame
his fear he leaped through the
opening in the wall ready to battle
to the death outside he received
another shock on the ground
which had been protected from the
rain were the marks of footprints
they had been almost obliterated
nevertheless he recognized them as
having been made by berts dilapi-
dated narrow shoes

  he dashed back into the house and
shook his father into wakefulness

 berts kidnaped marie quick
lets go after them the sneaking
little coward ill break every bone
in his body this time and you cant
stop me

  why thats ridiculous cried
the doctor where could he take
her the country is as flat as your
hand

  nevertheless after examining the
trampled grass he had to admit that
the umenians had no part in the
affair

  frank was for starting after the
pair at once but his father pointed
out that they probably had been cap-
tured at the outskirts of the city or
if they had not he and his son un-
doubtedly would be turned back
now that day had broken

 we must report to the king at
once hell send a squad of red
guards after them and bring them
back in an hour or so the country
is as flat as your hand and theres
no place to hide

  at the palace however their way
was barred an unusual procedure
which fretted their nerves still fur-
ther franks mind was full of
dreadful pictures of what might hap-
pen to marie he pictured her lost
and starving in that untracked wil-
derness but he bit his lips until
they bled and refused to let his
thoughts carry him farther

  after a delay of several minutes
a yellow-tinted official approached
and made contact with the doctor in
the approved ceremonial manner
apologized for the delay and led
them through a labyrinth of cham-
bers to the audience hall

  there everything was in buzzing
confusion purple messengers
scrambled hither and yon council-
lors were grouped about the king
their delicate antennas in quivering
plane people



connection with his for all the
world it looked like a gigantic ant
hill laid open

  toko broke contact as the earth
men were ushered in and buzzed a
command that they be allowed to
approach

  most illustrious sir his majes-
tys thoughts fell over each other
into his visitors minds after a new
connection had been made thanks
for your visit but i fear i shall have
little time for you this day my
kingdom is in an uproar puro and
members of an apparently harmless
youths movement which he recently
organized have revolted and left the
city half my army has mutinied
and fled with them

  they escaped a thousand strong
in the midst of the storm last night
just now i received a messenger
from puro advising me that he and
his followers had gone to treeka
which is a little town near the rim
of the planet and the place where
he was born he added that the
strange tribes had promised to join
him in an attack upon this city un-
less i agreed to abdicate at once

  there is the messenger he
waved a stumpy jointed leg toward
a pile of charred flesh in the middle
of the hall that was my answer

  a horrible suspicion formed in
franks mind could it be that bert
had joined hands with the former
secretary of state

  the king screamed with excite-
ment as he read this thought

  yes o king admitted doctor
strauss the member of our party
whom you call the fearful one also
has fled carrying with him the girl
known to you as the smooth one
we know also that he held several
conversations with puro just before
you forbade any of us to leave the
city

  why did you not tell me this

wailed toko it was puro who
warned me that you were planning
to escape i see it all now he had
been plotting with the fearful one
and did not want you others to scent
the plot oh sir i beg your pardon
humbly for the injustice i have done
you

  a new thought struck him does
this mean illustrious sir that the
fearful one will teach puros men
to bring the terrors of your third
dimension against us he quavered

  i fear so your majesty an-
swered the doctor the fearful
one knows much of chemistry and
might not only make dreadful ex-
plosives but also machines to lift
your enemies above you where they
could do great execution with their
ray guns

  this is the end of my reign
then muttered toko his whole yel-
low body falling limp i must ab-
dicate to save my people

  youre wrong old fellow inter-
rupted frank who had been holding
his fathers hand all this time and
thus had been in tune with the whole
conversation why dont you put
my father in charge of the defenses
of umenia his wisdom is great

  the kings slit eyes brightened
with hope your son has inspired
me with new hope o illustrious
sir he exclaimed it shall be as
he suggests you shall have puros
place as secretary of state and teach
my army also how to elevate them-
selves your son shall be minister
of war

  not so fast interrupted frank
my first duty is to the smooth one
im going to rescue her if i suc-
ceed and return i shall be glad to

accept your offer otherwise-

he shrugged his shoulders then
added if your majesty will be
pleased to grant me a safe conduct
out of the city i will be going


astounding stories

  toko scribbled a few lines on a
tablet snatching this with a hur-
ried word of thanks frank stooped
and grabbed a ray gun from the claw
of a near-by guard then he vaulted
over the wall of the audience hall
dodged hurrying umenians reached
the street and raced back to the hut
to make an effort to pick up berts
trail

  once there he made a discovery
of something which he had over-
looked in his first excitement lead-
ing away from the hole in the wall
of maries room was a faint trail of
moss fragments he surmised that
the girl must have snatched a hand-
ful of this after bert had bound and
gagged her and dropped it bit by
bit to guide possible rescuers she
had pluck

  the trail did not last long but
was sufficient to give frank an idea
of the direction his rival had taken
this was straight toward the rim
of the comet on the line of the least
resistance that is on the radius of
a circle

  aided greatly now by the cen-
trifugal force which had so hindered
him in reaching the capital weeks
before frank started along the dim
trail in ten-foot leaps praying that
he might not be too late at the
city gate his passport let him
through and he plunged on into the
open country

  frank had not gone far before he
saw on the wet grounds signs that
bert had had trouble in carrying his
struggling burden marie was not
exactly plump any more due to the
lack of candy and sodas and also
because of the athletic outdoor life
she led on the comet but neither
had she become a featherweight
half a mile from town he came upon
dim tracks in the road which indi-
cated that the kidnaper had set the
girl on her feet then forced her on-

ward probably at the point of a
weapon

  the pursuer redoubled his speed
in hope of overtaking them soon
he had passed the last straggling
suburb and was in the open country
now the land on either side still
was intensively cultivated however
and grew the strange flat vegeta-
tion of umenia in luxuriant abun-
dance now and then he saw a
farmer crawling about the fields

  despite his haste frank could not
help marveling anew at the trees
which bordered the road they lay
flat on the ground with their
branches pointing like magnets away
from the center of the planet
these he thought would serve to
keep him from losing his way and
enable him if he should rescue
marie in a wild and uninhabited dis-
trict to make his way back to the
capital without difficulty he hoped
so anyway

  after another hours travel he
brought up short at a crossroads
on the damp ground were countless
claw marks made undoubtedly by
puros revolutionists evidently
bert had joined them here frank
slowed down now realizing that a
direct attack upon such a force
would be fatal he kept on dog-
gedly however and soon was re-
warded by hearing in the distance
the buzzing like that of a thousand
hives of bees which marked the lo-
cation of the enemy

  he kept at a safe distance until
the short day had passed and puros
men encamped beside a wide and
shallow river as the sun slid over
the edge of the comet the inevi-
table clouds rolled down and the
rain soon was lashing franks back
until it ached

  he waited until the camp ap-
peared asleep then disregarding his
discomfort crept toward it hoping
plane people



to evade any guards and effect a
quick rescue

  hardly had he approached the first
line of shelters-they were nothing
more than strips of metal set up on
the windward side of each company
of soldiers-than a flash from a ray
gun seared the vegetation to cinders
despite the rain the blast missed
him only by inches instantly other
sentries took up the fusillade frank
was faced with the alternative of
being burned to a crisp or develop-
ing tactics which would throw his
attackers into confusion

  unhesitatingly he chose the lat-
ter course reaching down he
grasped one of the metal strips
which served as a tent for the sol-
diers it was about eight feet long
three inches wide and an inch thick
using it like a pole vaulter the
youth hurled himself in great leaps
straight into the heart of the enemy
camp

  the strategy completely baffled
the sentries who of course could
only see their enemy when he was
standing on the ground they set
up a wild buzzing as they scuttled
back and forth which in a few mo-
ments threw the whole camp into
turmoil as he progressed in eight-
foot bounds frank saw the compa-
nies scrambling to arms like gigantic
ants whose hill has been molested
speed was his only salvation

  as he neared the center of the en-
campment frank caught sight of
bert who was crouched in the dim
light beside a still figure on the
ground the chemist had seized a
ray gun and was firing frantically
at the oncomer but he was trem-
bling with fright and inexperienced
with the weapon to add to his
difficulty his enemy altered his
jack-rabbit course repeatedly as he
came charging forward

  at last he was upon them gath-

ering himself for one supreme ef-
fort he hurled himself feet fore-
most striking bert squarely in the
chest and hurling him head over
heels into the mud

  but frank did not escape un-
scathed for a fleeting moment the
ray had made contact the effect
was as if his body had been seared
by a white-hot iron

  staggering dazed he bent down
grasped the girl who was bound
hand and foot and succeeded in
throwing her over his shoulder
then snatching up his pole he
started a wild retreat his arms
seemed drained of all strength and
felt like blazing torches he grit-
ted his teeth and lurched on while
ray guns flashed in all directions
the rain poured down in lashing
horizontal torrents and the wind
howled

  how he escaped from that inferno
he never knew dimly he recalled
reaching the open country still
more vaguely he remembered that
when the pursuit had died away he
had allowed marie to slip from his
shoulders and had cut her bonds
after that-nothing

  a long while later frank came
back to consciousness to find him-
self lying in his old bed in the hut
a dim light shown by the bedside
and the rattle of paper near by con-
vinced him that his adventure had
not been a halucination

  his old fear for marie came back
to him with a rush as his mind
cleared he tried to sit up but felt
a detaining hand on his shoulder
marie was bending over him for
a moment he stared up at her sweet
anxious face

   lo darling he said softly as
though he had always used that term
of endearment youre really beau-
tiful arent you

  she blushed


astounding stories

  thank god you have come back
to me she whispered kneeling be-
side him for a while we thought

that-

  suddenly tears filled her eyes
she bent down and touched her lips
to his in their first kiss frank did
not marvel at this change from their
almost casual relationship in the
past it seemed now as if they had
always been lovers but had not
known it

  tell me about yourself he
captured one of her slim hands in
his

  you know most of it already
bert sneaked into my room that
morning and tied my hands and feet
before i awakened the storm was
making so much noise that i couldnt
rouse you by my screaming he
jammed a gag into my mouth then
he dragged me out and carried me
for a while when he wasnt look-
ing i dropped bits of moss as a
guide to you i knew you would
follow

  bert wore himself out in the
first half mile when he set me
down i hoped you would catch up
with us but he prodded me along
with a ray gun until we caught up
with puro then i almost despaired
until you came flying through the
air and picked me up

  did bert molest you in any
way

  no puro kept him too busy
talking about plans for three-dimen-
sional weapons and explosives you
see that old flat devil has a little
town on the edge of the planet
ever since he was elevated he has
been planning a revolt our spies
tell us that he is already manufac-
turing munitions according to berts
specifications

  wait a minute how long have
i been lying here like this

  two weeks darling you had a

terrible burn we thought youd
never recover the best thinsie doc-
tors from all over umenia came to
treat you

 a week later frank was
strong enough to be up and about
slowly he threaded his way through
the umenian capital which had be-
come an armed camp during his ab-
sence and marveled at the changes
that had come over the thinsies since
he last had seen them

 oh youve got a lot to learn
about the umenians chuckled the
doctor they arent really two-di-
mensional of course-no living
thing could be they merely
thought in two dimensions just as
we think in three merely because
weve had no need of a fourth di-
mension this flat world allowed
them to fulfill all their desires with-
out rising above it in fact they
prefer to live in two dimensions
it was an awful struggle to elevate
them

 since frank had left the city
however the inhabitants seemed to
have grasped many ideas of the
third dimension the walls were
surrounded by shallow defense
trenches many of the soldiers were
moving about dragging supply wag-
ons behind them while a company
or so of the thinsies had been pro-
vided with little tricycles on which
their heads and what might be
called their shoulders rested these
vehicles lifted their occupants two
feet above the ground and enabled
them to become conscious of height
for the time time in their history
frank was amazed to see the ease
with which they scooted about

  i had intended to equip the whole
army with those elevators  ex-
plained the doctor but the king
wants to attack with very little de-
lay so we could get few of them
plane people



completed in time for the advance
dont you think theyll give us a
great advantage over the rebels
he wilted visibly when frank ex-
plained that bert probably would hit
on the same idea

  dont think he has it in him
grunted the little man well we
must lick him anyway our lives
wont be safe until we do

  even toko had succumbed to the
three-dimensional urge he greeted
the convalescent from a raised metal
throne when the trio of earthlings
went into the royal tent he still
used his antenna to communicate
with them telepathetically since
even the doctor had never been able
to learn the buzzing audible lan-
guage of the umenians

  your illustrious father has in-
indeed opened my eyes to a new
world he said courteously he is
now my secretary of state and is go-
ing to lead the attack upon the
rebels

  but i dont know the first thing
about military tactics the doctor
groaned after they had finished pay-
ing their respects to the monarch
and were alone once more what
shall i do

  i dont know a thing about fight-
ing either said frank now if it

were football-

  fine cried marie lets make
a football game out of it how
would you proceed

  well the flatheads who arent
provided with kiddie cars could be
the linesmen well divide the
umenians who have been elevated
into two divisions of one hundred
each to represent the right and left
half backs the three of us will re-
ceive the ball at full back

  what ball asked the girl
lets not worry about that just
yet the capital will be the goal
post for old umenia if puro is de-

feated hell fall back on his city
well let the enemy kick off in mid-
field and try to run the ball clear
back over the edge of the planet
how about the strategy of the
home team queried his father

  thats right wheelers knowl-
edge of chemistry is the ball you
were asking for puro hasnt had
time to construct guns but he could
have made bombs and grenades
well have to use open formation
then

 as the sun slanted toward the
zenith in closer and closer spirals
king tokos army marched as queer
a sight as a vision in a nightmare
in the van wriggled eight companies
of one hundred flatlanders each be-
hind them scooted two hundred oth-
ers mounted on their platforms and
able to wreak destruction above the
bodies of the linesmen in the
rear of the thinsies marched frank
the doctor and marie the girl had
refused to be left behind declaring
that she was as good a soldier as
any man there

  ten days of travel brought them
to puros camp but the alarm had
gone before and the rebel army was
drawn up to receive them

  thought so said frank no-
tice the artillery

  in the rear of the camp could be
seen a line of earthworks over which
peeped the muzzles of what looked
like a battery of cannon behind
these bert could be seen crouching
low to the ground

  i thought you said there would
be no cannon marie began

  just sheet-metal mortars ex-
plained the doctor range prob-
ably only a few hundred yards
why not try a flank movement
and force them to remount those
guns asked frank

  you forget that were on the up
side of the planet returned his fa-


astounding stories

ther if we flank them our posi-
tions will be reversed and well find
it hard to charge them against the
centrifugal pull no wed better
advance in close formation until
they open fire then spread out and
continue by rushes their first
shots will go wild and do little or
no damage

  striving to conquer a shaky feel-
ing in his legs the doctor then gave
the necessary commands to the cap-
tains of the umenian companies and
the advance began frank mean-
while renewed his pleas for marie to
stay behind but she shook her head
stubbornly and gripped a ray gun as
she plodded along beside him

 if you are defeated i cant
escape she said if im with you
maybe i can help the battle isnt
always to the strong somebody
said

  the little army went forward with
a rush but strangely enough found
no resistance to their advance in-
stead puros forces at the head of
which could be discerned berts
spare figure turned and scuttled
pell-mell from the trenches

 buzzing like maddened bees
tokos forces poured over the de-
serted breastworks frank marie
the doctor and a few of their thin-
sie aids were quickly outdistanced
by the victory-seeking soldiery

 too late frank scented an am-
bush they had reached the center
of the enemy camp when he shouted
wildly the cannon mind the
cannon

 looking behind them the earth
people gasped in dismay pale
greenish gas was belching from the
muzzles of the flimsy guns and
carried by the planets unvarying
wind was drifting silently down
upon them

  chlorine gas cried the doctor
cold fear gripping his heart get

above it frank or were done for
ill run ahead and warn the king
you two and what thinsies have
stayed with us try to capture the
battery and turn off the gas

 frank and marie went into hur-
ried contact with their aids who
numbered scarcely more than a
dozen then swung to the right to
dodge the deadly spreading fog and
began a hampered run uphill to
the guns hardly had they started
however when the sand seemed to
boil to right and left of the emplace-
ment and a score of puros men who
had lain hidden beneath the
smoothed-over surface during the
advance crawled into view ray
guns were grasped in their claws
gas masks were strapped over their
ugly flat muzzles and their fore-
parts were elevated by tricycles
similar to those used by the royal
forces

 then began a strange duel the
red heat rays of the loyal umenians
spurted forth on their errands of
destruction but were met in mid-
air by the flashes from the guns of
the rebels the result was a series
of loud explosions which canceled
the effects of both weapons back
and forth wove the beams dimly
visible in the sunlight always keep-
ing in crackling contact except when
one of the opponents would slip his
beam around that of his enemy ex-
actly as a fencer uses his rapier
then would come a short agonized
buzz a ray gun would tumble fiito
the sand and a fiatlander would
stiffen in smoking death

 frank and marie soon found
themselves engaged with two of
puros soldiers her face white and
terror in her eyes the girl yet han-
dled her unfamiliar weapon like a
veteran dodging out of harms way
as a red beam flashed close swaying
side-stepping like a swordsman

            ast-
plane people



whenever frank could find time to
steal a glance in her direction he
was amazed to note the grace and
agility with which she fought

  it was one of those side glances
which almost signed his death war-
rant at the instant when his eyes
were refocusing on his own enemy
he stepped into one of the holes
wherein the rebels had been in am-
bush stumbled and went to his
knees his gun flying into the air

  the creature with which he had
been engaged hesitated a moment as
its untrained eyes tried  to follow
this quick maneuver then it lo-
cated its enemy again and the ray
swung steadily down to burn the
enemy to a cinder

 out of the corner of his eye
frank saw marie swing her weapon
to focus on his foe this left her
unprotected from her own adver-
sary he tried to shout a warning
-to tell her not to mind him but to
save herself-but at that instant
heard a reassuring hiss from behind
him as one of his flat aids recogniz-
ing the danger scrambled into the
battle caught maries adversary off
guard and reduced it to smoking
ruin

 keep your mind on your work
after this frank gasped the girl
i can take care of myelf any-
way weve got them on the run

  surely enough the growing casu-
alties in the ranks of the opposing
company had broken its morale
abandoning the unwieldy tricycles
the defenders of the battery were
scuttling madly to safety leaving
the gas guns unprotected

  it took frank but a moment to
shut off the chlorine valves but he
could do nothing to stop the cloud
of gas already emitted which was
rolling down the plain in a thick
blanket toward friend and foe alike
from the other side of this curtain

  ast-

loud explosions and excited buzz-
ings told that puros men had
stopped their feigned retreat and
turned upon the kings forces who
thus were to be held in a trap until
the gas swept down to strangle
them

  panting with exhaustion frank
and marie watched the tumbling
green waves sweep slowly over the
sand they were silent in dazed
horror frank tried to speak but
his dry throat would not emit a
sound he pictured his father
strangling falling dying behind
that curtain and a wild impulse to
scream to fling himself into it al-
most overpowered him

  i dont feel so badly for the thin-
sies he heard marie confessing
softly as she clung to his arm
they never seem quite real to me
but your father is caught in there
well have to save him somehow

  if we could only let them know
that the gas blanket is only a hun-
dred yards thick i believe they
could charge back through it with-
out much damage replied the
other but if they let it drift down
on them while the enemy stops their
advance all will be dead before it
drifts on its moving very slowly
and wont pass over for minutes
im sure of that

  a hundred yards thick you say
marie gasped

  well maybe two hundred not
more than that wait ill chance
it

  suiting the action to the word
frank ripped off what remained of
his shirt and wrapped it around his
nose and mouth good-by marie
he cried thickly through the impro-
vised mask and was gone before she
could protest running straight to-
ward the gas screen

hell never make it the girl
moaned in terror he has to come


astounding stories

back through it too and hes still
weak

 she wrung her hands as she
watched him disappear into the mist

 frank ran as he had never done
on the gridiron the devilish green
poison burned his eyes and blinded
him his lungs soon began quaking
for air but he kept on doggedly
holding his breath as his thoughts
raced ahead treated the old man
bad enough couldnt let him be
trapped like this must get through

 his knees grew weak as though
they were turning to water his
head throbbed like a drum still
there was no end to the gas but the
sounds of fighting grew stronger
telling him that he was traveling in
the right direction

 like a spring mechanism which
has run down his legs sprawled
from under him he plunged for-
ward a few more steps took a long
tearing involuntary breath and
fell all over he mused vaguely

  but the air did not claw at his
lungs as he had expected then he
realized that he had broken through
the screen somewhere before he col-
lapsed this thought and the fresh
air revived him he scrambled to
his feet and reeling and groggy
stumbled toward where tokos men
were engaged by their gas-masked
enemy

  dad dad he panted as the doc-
tor came running to meet him
turn them back the gas is only
a hundred yards thick weve shut
it off if tokos men retreat through
it they can escape if they stay
here theyll be suffocated

  doctor strauss shouted with de-
light at this chance for life and ran
to communicate with the king
toko communicated with his cap-
tains and within a few minutes
after frank had burst through the
screen the royal army was in or-

  derly though precipitate retreat
leaving their enemies nonplused at
what they must have considered a
suicidal flight

 back through the green hell
frank plunged one arm around the
shoulders of his father pushing the
old man ahead as both were shaken
by fits of coughing no use trying
not to breathe at the slow pace he
now was obliged to take must use
only the tops of his lungs easy
there dont cough

  he dragged the doctor forward as
the latters steps began to falter at
last he was forced to pick the older
man up and carry him if only one
of the hundreds of umenians whom
he heard coughing and rustling over
the ground at his feet could rise up
and help him carry his burden

  marie was lifting his father from
his back frank slipped into pleas-
ant oblivion

 he revived to feel a cooling
sensation in his raw throat he felt
the clawlike hands of a thinsie doc-
tor manipulating his chest through
red-rimmed eyes he made out ma-
ries face bending over him

  im all right darling he man-
aged to gasp

 most certainly you are out of
danger honorable sir he felt the
thoughts of his physician humming
through his brain your courage
has saved umenia your noble par-
ent is doing nicely also do not
exert yourself however

 how is the battle going the
patient gasped his blurred mind
filled with visions of the masked
enemy pouring down upon them

 weve got them licked marie
answered we followed up the gas
curtain and struck them while they
were still demoralized at tokos re-
treat our men ran so fast that they
were practically unharmed by the
plane people



chlorine gas the field is a sham-
bles

  and in fact when frank insisted
on sitting up it was to witness a
debacle not far off was a little
group of perhaps a hundred surviv-
ors from the rebel army these
were surrounded by buzzing hordes
of royalists

  puros men presented a sorry spec-
tacle their flimsy elevators
were almost all lost or broken and
they were reduced to their former
two-dimensional state

  as his vision cleared frank drew
in his breath sharply in the cen-
ter of that circle bert wheeler was
crouched shouting unheeded orders
imploring yammering in a mad
frenzy of fear

 cant we save bert croaked
frank after all he isnt bad
enough to deserve a fate like that

  im afraid not marie sighed
the king and his men blame bert
for this whole affair

  the group of survivors was dwin-
dling rapidly as they spoke time
after time little puffs of smoke
would arise and leave a rebel shriv-
eled into a pile of brownish ashes
yet the doomed creatures kept up a
steady return fire and held off the
royalist hordes

  a few minutes more however and
they must have realized that it was
all over suddenly puros men
ceased firing then with one ac-
cord their ray guns swung inward
and flashed together

  even at that distance the other
earthlings could see berts agonized
expression as he leaped to his feet
screaming when the rays focused
their combined strength upon him
for a moment he stood with his feet
enveloped in a sea of red flame
then he began to grow shorter
screaming still he seemed to melt a
foot into the ground before he flung

out both arms and crashed forward
on his face

  the shafts of light did not falter
berts writhing body continued to
melt into the sand his screaming
became a moan and died away
puros false leader had paid the
price of failure

 frank could not tear his eyes
away as the royalists infuriated by
this thwarting of their efforts to
capture the unfortunate youth went
into action their rays swept the
nearly defenseless rebels like a
scourge there was a spurt or two
of red flame in reply then the last
of puros following was gone

 oh how awful whimpered
marie shuddering convulsively as
she clung to her lover poor old
bert didnt deserve that

  and that was all the epitaph he
received

  darkness was falling by the time
king toko had rallied his forces
and paid his respects to his secre-
tary of state who now was able to
sit up and talk a bit although his
lungs had been badly scorched by
the gas

  will you deign to return to my
capital city most illustrious sir and
receive all the honors which umenia
can confer upon you his majesty
demanded as he and the earthlings
sat in contact on the blood-stained
field

  you honor us sighed the little
doctor a trifle bitterly as he glanced
up into the evening sky where the
earth hung green and fair like a
giant scythe blade we will try to
repay you for your hospitality by
teaching your people all that we
know

  hours later as the two disabled
men and the girl were being dragged
homeward over the sand on a make-
shift litter made of discarded ele-
vators and drawn by a score of the


astounding stories

thinsie soldiers the doctor began
muttering almost deliriously

  there are these rocket ships he
murmured while frank and marie
clasped each others hands and

smiled tenderly down at him
maybe we can build one and get
back to earth never can tell
what a write-up id get in the pa-
pers if we did

energy of the universe

   reports recently by professor robert a millikan doctor i s
bowen and doctor h v neher in the physical review indicate that cos-
mic rays form half of all the radiant that strikes the earth in the universe
as a whole the amount of cosmic radiation is from thirty to three hundred
times greater than all other forms of energy combined

    it is now commonly known that the universe consists of tremendous
depths of empty space dotted by tiny specks called galaxies and that these
galactic specks have scattered over them just as sparsely still smaller
things called suns the suns in turn have parasitic bodies near them
called planets man lives on one of these

    on this microscopic scale the common concept that energy is what
one uses in performing some physical task shrinks into complete insig-
nificance what makes up ninety-nine per cent of all the energy in the
universe is radiant energy flying with the speed of light through space

    a small amount of this energy apparently comes from our sun and its
millions of fellows as they radiate light by the familiar process of losing
part of their mass in this way the sun turns two hundred and fifty million
tons of mass into light every minute the theory that the process will
eventually result in the heat death of the sun is not as firmly held as it
was formerly	- 

    but there is still the greater part of the energy in the universe to
explain the report of professor millikan is only one of several that
maintains cosmic rays form this part

    the explanation of the difficulty is that no such ready mechanism like
the burning up of the sun is at hand to be seized by scientists however
three theories do exist as possible paths of approach one is that the
distant suns and stars may emit cosmic rays by a burning-up process exactly
as our sun emits light experience says no but the conditions on these
stars are practically unknown

    a second theory would have it that some of these distant bodies may
contain elements of an unstable nature like uranium which breaks up of
its own accord and emits the cosmic rays just as uranium and radium emit
gamma rays

    a third theory maintains that there is a building-up process going on
out in space whereby heavier elements are formed by the union of lighter
ones such a linkage has been effected in isolated cases in laboratories
and when it does occur penetrating radiation is emitted it may occur in
space also
always the same that dream-with the mad womans dagger nearing my

throat yet  loved her i

my lady of the tunnel

by arthur j burks

there is nothing ob-
scure or even particularly
strange about it i know ex-
actly at what period of my life the
grim dream started as for its
aftermath the end of it i am con-
vinced that another hand will set it
down for i shall not be alive to do
so and i feel that the end will
come here in this house under the
elms gloomy and forbidding on
long island

  it is a far cry from long island
to the western homestead where
the dream began and necessitates a
sort of recapitulation but for me
that is easy because every phase of
it is written on the retina of my
memory as though in letters of fire
listen then

  it began with a story i was i
should say about thirteen years of
age i was studious i read every-
thing i could find that was readable


astounding stories

however in a western homestead
operated by my mother who labored
like a strong man from dawn to
dusk and never had any money for
purchase of anything save the bar-
est necessities reading matter was
limited

  we had subscribed to one metro-
politan newspaper-on which our
subscription was always very much
in arrears-and it was in this paper
that i found the serial called my
lady of the tunnel to-day that
story perhaps would not be run in
any magazine or newspaper in the
land but im referring now to a
serial which ran twenty years ago
those twenty years during which i
have lived more than the average
man does in two lifetimes seem to
have passed in a flash but when i
sit down and review them which i
cant help doing at intervals-for i
must to keep from going insane-the
time seems to have been ages ago

  perhaps you read that story it
was written by a man called herman
panzer i recall very little of the
actual story save that it had some-
thing to do with the civil war of
spies and counterspies-all the un-
holy stuff of death and destruction
of heartache and heartbreak-and of
horror

  it seems there was an aged house
-im referring to that story now-
which was connected with another
house almost a mile away by a tun-
nel there came a time in the shift-
ing fortunes of war when the rebels
held one of the houses the federals
the other-and often the enemies
tried to trick each other by way of
the tunnel whether they ever suc-
ceeded or not is immaterial what
is material is that many lives were
lost in these attempts and not one
of them in either cause

  those who died were murdered
struck down in the dark and when

found each one had a knife thrust
to the hilt in his throat

  according to the story the tun-
nel was inhabited by a mad woman
dressed in white perhaps she could
see in the dark i dont know it
was quite safe for any one to tra-
verse the tunnel if that one carried
a lantern but if one stepped into
the darkness there always followed
a shriek a moan and the careless
one was found supine on the tunnel
floor a dagger driven to the hilt in
his throat and on his face a look
of abysmal horror

  nobody was ever stabbed with
anything but a dagger not a pon-
iard a stiletto or anything except
a dagger the mere word has ever
since been good for a shudder when
i see it in print or hear it spoken

  that story because i was an im-
aginative boy frightened me half
to death and to-day thought of it
still does

  our shack on the homestead had
one huge room it had two beds
one of which folded up against the
wall my mother slept in the big
bed my brother and i in the fold-
ing bed-and i was always forget-
ting things you see i was now old
enough to do a few things around
the homestead but i was scatter-
brained and in the end my imagina-
tion and my scatter-brainedness will
be my undoing

  we would be in bed perhaps my
brother and i asleep the light
would be out and the room filled
with darkness our shack was
lonely our nearest neighbor being
several miles away we had a barn
at some little distance say seventy-
five yards from the house we had
two horses and a milk cow a tur-
key gobbler and a couple of turkey
hens and a small flock of chickens

  george my mother would say
suddenly out of the darkness ill
my lady of the tunnel



bet you forgot to separate the cow
and calf before you went to bed
if you leave them together there
wont be any milk in the morning
go and see now

  aw mother i would say i
didnt forget

  youve got the quilts over your
head again my mother would reply
sharply some of these days youll
smother what makes you cover
up like that your brother charlie
doesnt

  how could i tell her that my
brother charlie who had no imag-
ination was not interested in read-
ing and wouldnt even listen to me
when i tried to tell him the story of
my lady of the tunnel how
could mother understand that i
kept the quilts up around my throat
to keep the lady of the tunnel from
stabbing me in the throat with a
dagger one couldnt say such
things to my mother one would
have been spanked big as one was
mother was a hard-headed practi-
cal person

  and there was a phrase in the
story which always gave me the
shivers it seemed that on occasion
the tunnel woman appeared to pros-
pective victims a man would be
shaving for example a door be-
hind him would open slowly in
his mirror he would watch it and
shiver a little perhaps but hold
quite still razor poised then a
bit at a time the haggard ghostly
lineaments of the mad woman
would appear through the door al-
ways she would be crawling on her
hands and knees would be dressed
in immaculate white and her fair
hand would grip the handle of a
dagger-always a dagger later i
wondered where she got all her dag-
gers as she invariably left the
weapon in the wound in the throat
of her victim but i couldnt argue

myself out of my fears by ridicul-
ing such obvious details

  im sure i separated the cow
and calf i insisted to mother

  get up and go see if you did

  what a horror that was i would
rise and quickly too since mother
meant it when she gave orders to
slip into my overalls and go out to
the dark barn i would try to slip
on my overalls with one hand while
with the other i would hold my pil-
low over my throat to keep back
the dagger of the woman of the
tunnel then when i had dressed
and reached the door and flung it
open to let the moonlight in i
would find myself bathed in cold
sweat and i took the pillow to
the bam with me

  once out in the open i would run
i would try to keep my eyes from
wandering across the moonlit home-
stead which was not all cultivated
and was heavily wooded with sage-
brush and greasewood because i
knew from past experience what i
would see among the shadows a
wraithlike figure a slender woman
dressed all in white moving like a
cloud of smoke or fog among the
brushwood i knew she wasnt
there yet always i saw her

  at the barn invariably i would
find that i had failed to separate
the cow and calf and while i did
it moving fearfully in the darkness
of the bam i held my pillow over
my throat with one hand

  then i would run back to the
house as fast as i could afraid to
look back for fear of seeing the
haggard ghostly lineaments of the
mad woman in full pursuit dagger
grasped in uplifted hand

  i would slam the door and liter-
ally hurl myself into bed covering
my head immediately with the
quilts

  but i read my lady of the tun-


astounding stories

nel through to the bitter end now
i know that the story really had no
end because i was a part of it and
it can end only when i am dead

  that horror of getting up in the
dark has stayed with me almost to
this day though of course i no
longer guard my throat with a pil-
low but i do get cold sweats when
i move in the dark and strain my
eyes for a sight of the haggard
ghostly lineaments of the mad
woman

 i dont know where the
dream began that part is hazy
and is made more so because i was
never exactly able to tell where re-
ality ended and the dream began
at first after finishing my lady
i was only afraid of the dark so
analogous i fancied with the tun-
nel in the story and the older i
became the worse became my ob-
session reason told me that it was
all just a story and that nothing
would ever happen to me id prob-
ably die of something else though
my mother often told me that i was
born to be hanged

  the cold sweats the stark almost
gibbering fear of the dark finally
brought on the inevitable i would
go to sleep with the covers over my
throat i always did that and in-
evitably the tunnel woman followed
me into my dreams out of it all
ive come to this conclusion that
we have nothing to say about our
own destiny i am just as sure that
my whole life was laid out for me
at birth and that i can change not
one iota of it as i am that my
mother was the greatest woman on
the face of the earth or above or
under it and may she outlive me

  so i started dreaming and my
dream was invariably the same

  i would waken in the dream
in the tunnel of the story i never

knew quite where it was and it
didnt matter i would waken in the
midst of panzers story i would
be just starting through the tunnel
holding the lantern high before me
with one hand while with the other
i would hold a thick pillow against
my throat i knew that the mad
woman wouldnt attack so long as
i held the lighted lantern but no
matter how carefully my lantern
was lighted or how well the wick
was trimmed or how filled the lan-
tern was with oil there was always
the chance that a cold breeze in the
tunnel would extinguish the light-
and then the mad woman would
strike

  in my dream i would always en-
counter the mad woman in the tun-
nel she would always have the
dagger in her hand but to me her
face was neither haggard nor
ghostly you see the horror of my
dream was this even as a child
when the dreams first began i loved
the mad woman

  as a child i loved her as i loved
my first school-teacher with a
childs adoration but i loved life
too the mad woman whom i
called sybil because she was
called that in my lady of the tun-
nel had a beautiful smile and her
eyes told me that she loved me too
but i couldnt escape the fact that
she was mad and that she killed
people

  so though i loved her as a child
loves a grown woman and she loved
me as a grown woman loves all
children she always attacked me
with the dagger just as my light
went out and my lantern always
went out at exactly the same place
in the dream-and always i would
be fighting with all my childish
strength against the mad woman
now that i could no longer see her
beautiful face because of darkness
my lady of the tunnel



i thought of it as haggard and
ghostly i would protect my
throat with the pillow while with
my free hand i would seek to keep
sybil from slaying me i loved her
so i refused to hurt her i merely
tried to disarm her i spoke to her
of my love even as i fought for my
life but never at any time then
or in later years did she answer me

 as we fought i would smell a
heady perfume in my nostrils sweet
overpowering my hand would
touch her skin soft and delightful
to the touch as the down on young
peaches her breath would fan my
cheeks her body would press
against me i would try to locate
the knife in the dark i would sense
it darting to my throat i would
grasp the wrist of the knife hand
but always she would be stronger
than i strong with the strength of
madness-and she would force my
hand down as the knife moved in-
exorably to my throat

  it would touch the pillow i held
and continue on into the feathers
with which the pillow was stuffed
closer and closer it would come to
my throat and then when the
point touched my throat i would
waken in reality to find my pillow
against my throat my body bathed
in sweat and tired as though i had
fought a real fight-and often as
not my mother would be standing
at the bedside in her white night-
gown shaking me

 wake up wake up she would
be saying in exasperation youre
having such a loud nightmare no-
body can sleep

  it would take me a minute to dis-
cover that mother wasnt sybil for
the resemblance especially to eyes
just opened from sleep was terrify-
ing

 i knew i would never marry
never love any one but sybil and

since i knew that there was no sybil
really i knew i would never marry
or love any woman of course i
was a child who couldnt see into
the future-fortunately if people
could see into the future the world
would go mad

 i guess i was a strange lad i
know i read everything and my se-
lections always aroused the ire of
my elders i read everything weird
occult and strange that i could find
i read history poetry the worlds
finest prose i read horatio alger
and oliver optic yes i read i
couldnt master the multiplication
table but knew whole chapters of
the bible by heart i could quote
verses many verses from paradise
lost from ii penseroso the
ancient mariner-any verse i read
and liked and i read all and liked
all

 but the alger books dealt with
new york

 one day i told my mother

 some day im going to new
york

  youll be a farmer my mother
said youll never see new york

 later i read something about
long island and became more spe-
cific

 i shall live in an old sedate
house on long island i told my
mother

  i dont know where long island
is replied mother but if its more
than ten miles from this homestead
youll never even see it

  i put this in here to show that
even then destiny was shaping it-
self in me i knew i was going to
long island new york some day
there was no hurry about it but i
knew i could not escape it any more
than i could escape death-or lov-
ing sybil

 and i knew even then that i
didnt really wish to go to long


astounding stories

island deep down inside me as a
matter of fact something warned
me that i must never live in an
old sedate house on long island
at the same time i knew in my very
soul that i could not escape going
and living in the nebulous house of
my fancy then it was all very
hazy now i know that it was all
worked out beforehand and that i
couldnt have escaped

  i imagine my wanderings before
i finally came to live in this house
where this is being written were in
the nature of attempts to escape my
destiny whatever it may prove to
be concerning that i know noth-
ing save that the end of this story
must inevitably be written by an-
other hand than mine

  i feel that believe it but cannot
tell you why

  the dream of sybil came to me
during all my childhood and youth
when i joined the marine corps
during the war i often felt much
ashamed of myself because when i
had to crawl out of my bunk to
take over my tour of sentry duty i
always either covered my throat
with my upflung arm or with a pil-
low i was caught at it innumer-
able times but i didnt tell my
buddies of my nightmares and their
constant gibing instead of break-
ing me of my fears made them
worse the dream came almost
every night and there were times
whon i had a particularly gloomy
post to walk when i could see sybil
ethereal as creeping mist among
the shadows especially on what my
buddies called the graveyard
watch i imagine the very words
brought forth the fancy for my im-
agination had certainly become no
less

  the war meant little to me so i
pass it over too much has already
been written about it but sybil

was my ever constant companion
throughout all that time i fought
with her at night when i dreamed
and my buddies laughed at me be-
cause i cried out the name of
sybil in my sleep they wouldnt
have understood if i had told them
or perhaps they would have i often
saw sybil in the smoke of battle
and she was part of the smoke so
that none but i might see her i
guess i was a fair sort of soldier-
and i wasnt especially unusual for
my buddies liked me in spite of
constant chaffing about sybil and
my nightmares which sometimes
wakened the whole barracks because
i shouted

  i was commissioned i rose from
the ranks i say this not to boast
but to show that i must have been
a normal man and certainly a bit
beyond the average in mentality

  i was ordered to the west indies
-and i lost sybil my dreams
ended abruptly and i had peace
that lasted for a year or so i for-
got to cover my throat when i
walked in the dark i still loved
sybil but i was becoming more nor-
mal in my own eyes i was grow-
ing up i might even marry though
of course my wife must resemble
the sybil of my dreams that was
important you see the reason why
i fought so carefully with sybil in
my dreams was that i was fighting
not against her but for her i
wanted to save her from madness
for myself in my dream i knew i
dreamed but i also knew that my
dreams were as real as reality i
cant explain that youll have to
accept it at least until youve lis-
tened to the rest which follows

 then sybil came back to me in
a strange way

 i was serving in the intelli-
gence department and my reports
my lady of the tunnel



went directly to the state depart-
ment in washington the place
santo domingo city a multiple
murderer had escaped from nigua
prison one of my men tried to
capture him and was badly wounded
by a machete the commanding
general when i reported the facts
to him said tersely in a way that
commanding generals have

  get him

  the murderers name was an odd
one john of the rose he was
a giant negro he had a sense of
humor and his spy system was the
greatest i have ever encountered
within half an hour after i had
been ordered to bring him in i
found a note in the pocket of my
khaki blouse how it arrived there
i never knew but it was from john
of the rose and it was a jeering
challenge he knew id been or-
dered to get him and told me i
would never succeed he would
he said play with me cat-and-mouse
fashion for a couple of months be-
fore he sent me with a dagger in
my throat to join the others he had
murdered

  a dagger in my throat

  as usual the word dagger made
me shiver but any thought of sybil
and john of the rose at the same
time never occurred to me one
was black one white one was very
real the other a figment of herman
panzers imagination

  john of the rose made a fool of
me for over a month he sent me
a note every day and i never learned
how he did it then came the note
which brought sybil back to me it
ran like this

  im tired of being a fugitive ill
be at the house of the leper in agua
dulce at midnight to-night come
for me alone and ill be there wait-
ing bring any one else and you
accomplish nothing you can ar-

rest me provided you are physically
able come armed as you like as
i shall be the winner either takes
john of the rose to prison-or he
commits another murder john of
the rose

  this has nothing to do with the
chronicle save as it had to do with
the return of sybil i decided to
accept the challenge of john of the
rose i thrust a couple of auto-
matics into my belt and went out
to get the murderer leaving santo
domingo city about eleven oclock
at night agua dulce is north of
santo domingo city roughly in the
area lying between the city and the
junction of a smaller river with
the ozama river this section is
almost impenetrable jungle but i
knew every foot of it because i had
made a military map of it

  i started off

  the obvious way to go to the
lepers house which was almost in
the center of the area was to pass
through villa francesca and take
the regular trail that crossed agua
dulce but john would expect me
by that way so i went instead
through the gate of san diego-
named to honor the son of christo-
pher columbus whose ruined pal-
aces remain to the left of the gate
as you exit-to the ozama river
there i purloined a yola a small
skiff belonging to some unknown
native fisherman with this i
rowed upriver almost to the spot
where the smaller river flows into
the ozama

  there i went ashore set the boat
adrift knowing it would be picked
up where the outgoing waters of the
ozama and the incoming waters of
the caribbean meet next morning
and restored to its owner then i
felt about until i found a trail lead-
ing into the jungle toward the
lepers house-so called because a


astounding stories

man had died in it of that disease
i went boldly into the trail it
was midnight the trees met above
the trail absolutely shutting out the
moonlight it was so dark that i
could see nothing and i followed
the aged trail by feeling for it with
my feet i couldnt see my hand
against my eyes once in a while a
firefly sped through the jungle his
light so large seemingly that i
stopped and listened for the motor
imagining a charging automobile
but i couldnt even hear the honk-
ing motor horns in santo domingo
city only two miles away but ap-
parently two hundred this was as
much jungle and as many things
could happen here as in the heart
of the cordillera centrales it was
the forest primeval

  i got well into the trail before i
remembered something two years
before an intelligence officer had
accepted a challenge such as john
of the rose had sent me they
found his headless body beside a
tree several days later he had
been decapitated by a machete his
head was never found

  i went cold john of the rose
was already a multiple murderer
he wouldnt hesitate to kill me
already he might be close enough
to touch me he was a native-and
once a native had followed me for
an hour through the jungle and id
never have known he was there if
i hadnt stopped so suddenly he
bumped into me with startled apolo-
gies-almost incidentally making
me swallow my tongue with fear

  however i had to go through
but now and again i could see the
white trunks of ceiba trees i knew
them but they looked like human
figures dressed in white they were
big enough for any one even so huge
as john to hide behind i might
pass one a man john might step

out and decapitate me with a single
slash of his machete

  so without realizing what i did
i lifted my forearm to cover my
throat at first i didnt get the sig-
nificance of this i was almost to
the clearing before i recalled that
i had done this many nights in my
life and instead of fearing john
of the rose when realization came
i feared sybil

  for here was no dream tunnel
but a real one-and death stalked
through it for some one i felt the
hair at the back of my neck stir
with my gruesome thoughts i felt
cold finger tips along my spine
whichever way i turned i sensed
some one behind me to take my life
the woods reason told me were
deserted and john of the rose was
probably many miles distant-but
something inside me made a fool of
reason

  ever and anon i stopped to lis-
ten and always i stood well away
from trees with my forearm across
throat but already i confused
john of the rose with sybil and it
was sybil whom i feared i heard
no sounds at all john of the rose
if he was close would make none
naturally and sybil could not
and both were here at least in my
imagination

  i plodded on

  i came to the clearing in which
the house of the leper was situated
the woods were behind me and in
my fancy scores of hands reached
for me i was in a cold sweat as
badly frightened as i had been after
reading the most lurid installment
of my lady of the tunnel

  i-well it scarcely matters that i
caught my automatics in my hands
and hurled myself across the clear-
ing at the door of that hut i
smashed through to find the hut
empty i circled the shack to find
my lady of the tunnel

ifl

not a living soul nothing that lived
save the darting fireflies and the
mosquitoes which made merry on
my skin

  i returned to santo domingo city
by the regular trail thats not im-
portant either

 nor is it important that next
morning i had a jeering note from
john of the rose he told me cor-
rectly every step that i had taken
the night before who owned the
yola i had taken where i had set
it adrift-everything he told me
how many times and where i had
stopped along that trail-and he
laughed at me for covering my
throat with my forearm

  i was sure that night that i was
alone in the jungle yet how did
john of the rose know all these
things

  but that isnt important either
for that same night after i fell
asleep in my own cot sybil came
back to me again we fought in
the tunnel-the same dream in all
its details yet crazy as it may
sound it was like a reunion of lov-
ers her face mirrored happiness
that we were together again even
in the nightmare it was ghastly
-and when i finally wakened i
knew i would never in life be free
of sybil

  things were being said about me
in service circles within a few days
i yelled in my sleep brother officers
said my superiors decided that
the tropics were getting my nerves
i couldnt tell them the truth or
theyd have thought me stranger
still i was worried myself for not
a night passed now that i didnt
dream of sybil

  but there was now one change in
the dream sybil kissed me-a kiss
of ineffable sweetness-before she
pressed the point of the dagger
against my throat

 well i was ordered home in
spite of the fact that i wanted to
stay in santo domingo i wanted
all the knowledge of the island i
could gather for i had begun writ-
ing and wished to write of the land
i had learned in spite of john of
the rose and his ilk to love an-
gered at the obstinacy of my su-
periors i resigned from the serv-
ice sure that i could earn my liv-
ing with my pen and sailed for the
states

  i was assigned to brooklyn navy
yard pending acceptance of my
resignation

 it came through in due course
it was not until i was installed in
quarters in new york a civilian
that i recalled my boyhood ambi-
tion to live in the great metropolis
this made me recall my youthful
fancies about an old house on long
island inside me sounded the old
voice of warning

  you are in new york it said
be satisfied with that dont put-
ter around long island

  it was nothing you could put your
finger on understand just an in-
ner warning in the past when i
had had inner warnings i had got
into trouble for not heeding them
but that i did never kept me from
going against fate when the inner
warnings came again it didnt this
time

 i would visit long island i
could not resist the urge

  but to what part should i go i
hadnt the slightest idea

  i decided after finishing a couple
of short stories and waiting for edi-
tors to report on them to visit long
island long island is large there
were countless places i could go
how should i decide

  ill go to pennsylvania station
i decided after a while and go to
the first place whose name i see on


astounding stories

a ticket as i peer through the win-
dow of the ticket office

  i had no sooner come to this de-
cision than that inner voice came
even stronger than before

 dont go dont go it said
almost aloud

  but i was stubborn

  i went to the station and ended
by buying a ticket for east north-
port i had no sooner done so than
i had the queerest fancy which
only went to prove what i had al-
ways at least subconsciously be-
lieved that nothing we do is of
our own free will that we go en-
tirely through life guided by
whom or by what i dont know
neither does any one else

  but i couldnt have turned back
after buying that ticket and ex-
changed it for another one had my
life depended upon it and my life
did depend upon it i was like a
man following out a post-hypnotic
suggestion i had no will of my
own i merely bought the ticket
and allowed myself to drift that
is all there was to it

  i caught my train a little sur-
prised to find myself on the right
one i changed at jamaica without
being told i landed in east north-
port i hadnt the least hesitation
i even hurried a little as though to
get it over with

 get what over with the inevi-
table 

  i caught a suburban taxi

  drive me to northport i said

  the driver didnt ask questions
he merely slammed the door and
started off we entered northport

  turn to the right there i next
commanded him

  if youll tell me who you-wanta
visit he said i can take you there
by the shortest route

 i dont know i oaid just
drive

  he made the turn

  far down the street high on the
side of the hill i saw the house
it was just as i had imagined it
it was old and sedate the blinds
looked like sightless eyes yes i
knew it well

  ill get out here at this house
i told the driver

  he jerked his head back startled
to stare at me

  you dont really mean here he
said

  but i do why shouldnt i

  well i guess it aint none of
my business but-well folks dont
ever stop here you see the house

  whats wrong with it

  nothin its the old man that
lives in it his names caleb farhm
an hes-

  the driver touched his forehead
i shivered a little but i knew how
small-town people often regarded
perfectly brilliant men as being a
little off id see for myself
farhm was a bachelor i wanted to
stay in his house if only for one
night it became an obsession with
me even as i talked with the driver
maybe farhm would take me in

  if only i had listened

 i have now been in the house
of caleb farhm for three weeks
he welcomed me without surprise
and readily arranged for me to stay
with him he must have been past
seventy years of age he had never
married he looked strange when
he told me that in his old age he
was sorry he had no children i
rapidly became the son he had
never had and when i told him
i was seeking a place in which to
write he was pitifully eager to be
of every assistance to me and he
was extremely wealthy though
miserly with himself
my lady of the tunnel



  ill never forget that first night
in the old house though each night
thereafter was more stirring than
the one preceding for almost as
i crossed the threshold of the old
house i knew something that sent
my heart racing filled me with
strange fear and excitement sybil
was nearer to me here than any-
where else in any other period of
my life

 i didnt tell old caleb farhm
about sybil-but ever since that
first night im convinced that he
knows maybe he listened outside
my door when i screamed sybils
name in my nightmare for the
dream came to me the very first
night more real than ever before
and for the first time sybil spoke
to me as we fought in the dream
tunnel

 we are closer together than
ever before she said while her fair
lips moved as though she kissed me
with the words and now my
dear you shall in very truth release
me

  the fight was the same the dag-
ger vas the same i wakened when
it touched my throat and sybil
said

 i try to keep from using the
dagger but my madness prevents
me fight against me fight hard
even to the point of slaying me-
for if my dagger penetrates your
throat you will die

 i remembered all this when i
wakened to hear caleb farhm
pounding on my door his quaver-
ing voice came through the panels

 what ails you son what ails
you

  i let old caleb in he stared at
me as though he thought me bereft
of all my senses

  youve something on your mind
your conscience he said tell

 so while i hadnt told him at
first i now did

  understand that in this writing
i am covering several nights i
confessed my obsession to old caleb
i told him of the story of my lady
of the tunnel he listened there
was a strange light in his eyes
which made me recall the gesture of
the taxicab driver when he had
dropped me at old calebs door
but i hadnt found anything about
caleb to fear he was eccentric
perhaps but nothing more i loved
him in a way though at times he
repelled me right now i had the
fancy that he hated me with a dread-
ful hatred but of course it was
only fancy

 i am convinced that though i
love this dream woman i must re-
lieve myself of her incubus or i
shall go mad i told caleb she
is awfully real to me mr farhm

 how will you rid yourself of
her he didnt seem surprised
didnt think me strange and i
thought i read fear in his voice
not of me or for me but for some
other reason-some reason i couldnt
even guess at

  i am always grasping her by the
throat with one hand while she
presses the dagger against mine i
explained i have never really
tried to choke her because i love
her at least in my dreams i have
always loved her

 who is to say where realities
and dreams are divided asked old
caleb hastily with an old mans
fury i thought go on go on

  ive an idea i said that if i
can go to sleep with the intention
of dreaming and of putting aside
my love for sybil i can bring my-
self to choke her to death if i
can she will die in the dream-and
perhaps i shall never dream of her
again


astounding stories

  and suppose in the dream she
thrusts the dagger into your
throat he demanded

  that startled me

  thats odd i said in the
dream i just had she spoke of that
said that if she ever really stabbed
me i would die well im all right
now mr farhm you need your
rest please go back to bed i
wont dream again to-night

  i escorted him to the door which
this time i did not lock now i
sit at my writing desk trying to
anticipate what will happen when
i go back to sleep-if i dream the
dream again-which i know i will
i know it

  will i be relieved of sybil for-
ever if i can force myself to choke
her life away if she in the con-
vulsions of her body while i stran-
gle her stabs me with the dagger
shall i die

  if i live after this next dream
ill write it all down here if i die
youll know that sybil thrust the
dagger home i wonder if that
should be the case if any marks will
be found on my corpse-the sign of
her victory

  you see i am thoroughly sane
i know sybil isnt real to any one
but myself as she must have been
real to herman panzer who created
her

  and now i have finished-perhaps
only for to-night perhaps forever
i dont feel emotional about it
either way i am satisfied for i have
lived a full life

  good night

  it gives me a queer thrill to
read those parts of george stynes
last story which state that some
hand other than his own shall write
the storys end it makes me feel
somehow like an instrument of his
fate but then arent most lawyers

instruments in the fates of their cli-
ents my own name doesnt mat-
ter but i was counsel for the de-
fense in the case of the state of
new york versus caleb farhm
charged with the murder of george
styne

  there was no question of farhms
guilt in my mind he stabbed
styne to death stabbed him in the
throat with a dagger as styne slept
that is fact

  i wonder what styne was dream-
ing i wonder if he dreamed that
sybil had the point of her dagger
against stynes throat when old
caleb drove his dagger home

  i guess its just as well we dont
know things like that

  but how can i help wondering
knowing what i know i know
what it seems george styne never
knew caleb farhm was interested
in styne because styne was a writer
but styne seems never to have asked
him why

  and now ill try to end this story
as styne would have ended it if he
had lived

 twenty-odd years ago caleb
farhm created in a story he wrote
one character whom he loved pas-
sionately it is the story of pyg-
malion and galatea all over again
for after a lapse of years old
calebs character became very real
to him-a sort of dream love he
made the mistake of telling a few
people when he first came to north-
port and the fact that those people
remembered kept old caleb from
going to the chair sent him to an
asylum instead

  but he did kill george styne

  he killed him because of over-
powering jealousy for his dream
sweetheart had not changed with
the years as old caleb had she
was still young so was george
styne

            ast-
my lady of the tunnel



  caleb farhm killed styne for two
reasons because he was jealous and
to keep him from slaying sybil
heroine of my lady of the tun-
nel which old caleb wrote twenty-

odd years ago under the pen name
of herman panzer

  the lawyer in me believes caleb
farhm insane i wish the human
being in me knew

needles

        a short while ago a girl of twenty-two began to complain of a
    pain in her left leg there seemed to be no cause for it yet it
    became increasingly painful and annoying at first she made light
    of it but as days went on and it did not improve she went to a
    doctor about it

        x rays showed a small sewing needle lodged in the flesh of the
    upper leg very near the skin it was easily extracted

        nine years before the girl had swallowed the needle there
    had been no ill effects and the doctor had advised leaving it alone
    in the intervening nine years the needle had worked all the way
    through to the flesh of the leg

        a dog once had a porcupine needle enter the back of his head
    and work out through the eye after a period of months sight
    was regained

                  caught in the vacuum swept

forward into

after a few seconds of fruit-
less dial twisting graham
 removed the head -set from
his ears and took to examining the
tubes and connections a puzzled
frown drew his brows close together
when he had finished for every-
thing was in perfect order

  but the radio receiver was as dead
as a herring worse it had devel-
oped a death rattle a sort of a
ghastly fluttering whisper that
blanketed the ether on all wave
lengths

  graham untangled his long legs
with sudden vigor and strode into
the pilots cabin ducking through
the low communicating door the
frown had given way to an expres-
sion of blank incredulity

  perry he said the radios out
of commission

  the pilot not taking his eyes
from the sea of white fog beneath
the plane asked grimly cant you
fix it

  no thats what strikes me so
funny the set itself is o k it
seems that something has gone
wrong with the air

  it sure does perry grunted
wrenching at the controls and
not only the air that carries your
signals but the air were flying in
were losing altitude fast and the
ship wont climb out of whatever is
dragging us down

grahams jaw dropped and he
squinted at the billowing mist which

the unknown-

now seemed so near the -a-
fastest amphibian plane of the
north atlantic air transport serv-
ice was falling into the sea

  cripes perry this is about
where the others disappeared

  the pilot kicked at the rudder
just about he agreed and
whats more were swinging to the
north cant even keep her to her
course

  there was no change in the
smooth pur of the motors no loss
of air speed but the controls were
useless the ship was nosing down
sharply and heading toward a point
where the fog was thickest it was
as if some invisible pilot had taken
the controls from perry by force
and was taking them to an unknown
destination on the surface

  perry cut the ignition but the
motors continued to fire in fact
they revved up slightly faster than
before

  then graham shouted look a
waterspout

  directly ahead was a column of
water that thrust up out of the fog
and flung itself into the heavens to
an enormous height not straight
upward but curving swiftly to the
west as it broke into spray that
shimmered in the sunlight there
were no clouds overhead only the
low-lying mists below this was
not a tornado formation

  thats no ordinary waterspout
muttered perry it holds to the


astounding stories

same diameter all the way up to the
spray and theres no whirling it
ought to whirl and be funnel
shaped damn queer

  graham repressing a desire to
blurt out his own misgivings said
nothing queer why these hap-
penings of the past two days were
more than that they were crazy
impossible many had said

  first there had been the icelandia
in her usual perfect condition when
she left harbor grace flying at
six thousand feet with a full cargo
and passenger list she had been in
constant radio communication with
headquarters as usual then only
a few hours out her signals had
ceased to come in and with three
radio transmitters aboard

  a swift rescue plane had gone out
after her at once the -a- this
too vanished in the same mysterious
manner some of the old-timers
had shaken their heads and said it
was her unlucky number-that she
was a fated ship

  after that was the stockholm
carrying six hundred passengers-
the loss of the icelandia had been
kept out of the news broadcasts so
they went unwarned-and an enor-
mously valuable cargo she had
gone the same way with a sudden
cessation of radio at about the same
point in the north lane two res-
cue planes went out after her and
had not been heard from since

  apparently disaster had over-
taken all five vessels at the same lat-
itude and longitude

  in more than nine years of opera-
tion since the first air liner took off
in  north atlantic air trans-
port had never lost a vessel until
now never a passenger or a sack of
mail or item of cargo the officials
became frantic all scheduled take-
offs were canceled but the influ-
ence of n a a t would be suffi-

cient to keep the news from the
broadcasts temporarily for it to
become public would be fatal

  after a hurried consultation of
experts the -a- was selected to
make a final desperate flight in the
effort to solve the mystery she
was too small to be of any use in
rescue work but she was very fast
and an amphibian besides if her
radio went dead as had the others
she could at least land on the sur-
face whether it be of ice or water
and cruise around in the suspected
region to search for wreckage or
other evidence of the disasters and
return to report on the probable
cause at least that was the pre-
sumption

  all the old-timers grinned and
agreed that the -a- had a lucky
number in a body they volun-
teered for the job

  only three were chosen-a mini-
mum crew frank perry as pilot
a serious-minded and studious chap
who was nevertheless one of the best
navigators in the outfit aubrey
graham as radio operator some of
the disrespectful old-timers called
him beanpole occasionally but
theyd have had a fight on their
hands had they dared to use that
first name of his as mechanic there
was joey dugan an expert in his
line if there ever was one but a
wistful-faced and undersized young-
ster who had once been compelled
to spend a year in the mountains
lungs

  graham frowned anxiously now
when he thought of dugan the
lad was up in the motor runway
knowing nothing of what was going
on in this god-forsaken stretch of
ocean

  just then the speaking-tube whis-
tle blew and dugans voice came
floating down hey perry what
the devil theres no ignition at
telegraph plateau



all but all three motors are hittin
on every cylinder

  the pilot turned his face to the
mouthpiece i know he said
better come down here dugan
aye sir the lad had served
his apprenticeship on one of the big
air liners where discipline is strict

  perry faced graham do you see
what i see down there he asked

  the waterspout had vanished
strangely no water had fallen back
through the fog to the sea it had
all fiung upward and away and was
entirely dissipated in the air
graham had noted that but he had
not seen what he now saw less than
a mile ahead he rubbed his eyes
and blinked a few times where the
base of the waterspout had been was
a yawning black hole in the fog a
hole that seemed to go down
through the heaving white mist and
into the ocean itself there was no
doubting that

  he said grudgingly ido see it
yes but i dont believe it

  gosh i do dugans voice
broke the ensuing silence apologeti-
cally somethins cornin out o
that hole too

  graham looked the -a- was
shooting down toward that black
rim of a devils bore like a thing
possessed and something was
coming up from out the depths-
a huge gray sphere a thing many
times larger than the biggest n a
a t liner

  perry little moved as usual and
thinking only of the scientific as-
pects of the thing remarked some
force from underneath blew away
that circle of fog itll close in
youll see

  your idea snorted graham
what about that big ball-ever see
anything like that

  no-o and it must have some-
thing to do with the column of wa-

ter possibly with the disappear-
ances

 the nose of the -a- rose
sharply and the ship seemed to lose
flying speed with a sudden lurch
again perry worked frantically at
the controls without result the
throb of the motors lowered rapidly
in pitch they were about to stall

  and the big gray sphere came up
steadily before them

  graham looking down was able
to see the lower curve of the thing
and observed with amazement that
it was covered with riveted metallic
plates like the hull of an ocean-
going vessel in the rolling mists
underneath was the opening from
which it had emerged truly an ori-
fice with sharply cut edge through
it far below was a glimpse of drift
ice and the tossing surface of the
ocean itself another yawning
opening a vast circular bore into
the very bosom of the ocean with
drift ice and waves breaking at its
rim as if hurled against a break-
wall graham was seized with a de-
sire to pinch himself

  the others were watching the
sphere suddenly dugan exclaimed
hey perry theres a door openin
in the side of it

  it was true only half true in
fact for two doors were slowly
swinging apart exactly like the
great doors of the n a a t han-
gars and the -a- headed directly

astounding stories

ket of fog the sphere with its
huge doors fully opened now
loomed immediately ahead

 so this is what became of the
others the pilot marveled for
once he had no technical explana-
tion on the tip of his tongue

  and well soon know all the de-
tails graham said dryly but we
wont be back at harbor grace to-
night

 nor ever probably gloomed
dugan were inside

  supported and propelled by some
inexplicable force the -a- swept
into the utter darkness of the
spheres interior it rolled on a
short way and lumbered to a stop

 so now what graham whis-
pered he felt something cold and
hard pressed into his hand

  one of the pistols said perry
softly may need it heres one
for you dugan

 the young mechanic answered
aye sir out of the gloom and
graham thought he heard his teeth
chatter

  for a time there was dead silence
save for the breathing of the three
in the small cabin you could cut
the darkness with a knife then
grahams stomach came up into his
mouth with that sensation one ex-
periences when a plane drops into
an air pocket or when descending
in a high-speed elevator he heard
the others gasp

 and he said awedly cripes
theyre dropping us into the hole

  in his minds eye he visioned that
inconceivable pit he had seen in the
oceans surface with waves beating
against a rim that seemed not to ex-
ist perhaps perry could explain
that

  theres a light sir dugan told
the pilot

 through a side window of the
cabin and seemingly a long way off

was a dim gleam as if a door in
some far wall was partly open

  well go out and investigate
perry decided no use staying
cooped up in here waiting for some-
thing to happen

  me first said graham eagerly
im the tallest and can help you
two down

 he swung out of the door and
clinging to one of the float struts
dangled his long legs in search of
solid footing he found it after a
moment and tested it with his
weight still hanging to the strut
outside the sphere he remembered
there had been nothing substantial
underneath

  o k he breathed and the oth-
ers came down

 they proceeded cautiously to-
ward the distant light none of
them had any delusions regarding
their chances against an enemy so
powerful as to own and operate a
machine like this enormous spheri-
cal vessel but each was possessed of
the urge to see the thing through
to the end and to learn as much as
possible before an actual clash
came

 the floor beneath them was
springy under their tread as if made
of extremely thin steel plate with
supporting beams not too closely
spaced and it was vibrating as if
in response to the impulses of high-
speed rotating machinery

  suddenly there was a flood of or-
ange light so intense as to blind
them to all that lay beyond it a
sharply defined boundary marked
the place where the light left off
and the darkness began they knew
they were being watched from the
other side of that boundary but
could see nothing of the watchers
the three men halted irresolutely
feeling like criminals in a police
line-up
telegraph plateau



  you will drop your pistols a
gruff voice ordered making sure
the safety catches are on resist-
ance is useless and will only make
immediate death certain for you

 grahams eyes narrowed as he
tried to pierce that wall of darkness
he resisted a mad impulse to empty
his pistol into the obscurity from
which the voice had come then let
it clatter to the floor plates along
with perrys and dugans

 the ring of light closed in on
them until the darkness was just
before their eyes then graham
saw naked arms reach out of noth-
ingness with clawed hands that
grasped dugans throat the lad
let out a gurgling cry

 that was too much graham
lunged into the gloom his long arms
flailing his fists contacted solid
flesh again and again and brought
forth grunts of surprise and pain
faintly he heard perry calling out
to him telling him to lay off

  something struck the back of his
skull with tremendous force noth-
ing mattered after that

ii

 when graham awoke it was
to the accompaniment of a thump-
ing head and a taste that he could
only liken to that of an old rubber
boot for aching minutes he lay
without moving a muscle or opening
his eyes he was striving desper-
ately to recall what had occurred
remembering finally he raised one
lid cautiously

  the light was poor and of strange
quality seemingly from a red-
orange source almost like that of a
photographic dark room he
opened his eyes and lifted his head
he was lying on a not uncomfort-
able cot and he now saw dimly a
barred door

  at his movement a voice whis-
pered his name it was perrys

  graham jerked himself erect and
saw a second cot on the other side
of his cell the pilot lay there
propped up on one elbow

  he asked softly how do you
feel

  rotten said graham where
are we anyway at the bottom of
the ocean

  were underneath the bottom be-
lieve it or not whats more a
strange race is living down here in
what must be a large city

  graham pondered this fingering
gingerly the surgical dressing on
the back of his head how long
have i been out he asked

  hours they gave you a hypo-
dermic and doctored up your head
ive been asleep for a long time
since that

  thinking was still somewhat diffi-
cult for graham but his headache
was subsiding after a long silence
he said under the bottom you tell
me that means there are caverns
-submarine ones and people are
living here different from us
they the ones that captured us
right and wait till you see
them

  grahams eyes were becoming ac-
customed to the orange-lit gloom
he now saw across the great room
that tier upon tier of barred cells
lined the wall they were prison-
ers in a huge jail not much differ-
ent from those in their own country
dugan all right he inquired
yes the poor kid was scared
half out of his wits but they treated
him pretty gently at that hes in
the next cell

  and the others-from the lin-
ers

  all here i guess there are
hundreds in this place men women
and children


astounding stories

  cripes what are we being held
for

  it was a question they were to ask
many times and perry did not re-
ply for the orange illumination was
brightening swiftly and there came
the sound of marching men in the
gallery

  guards halted before their cell
and the door was opened come
out a voice rasped perry and
graham stepped into the eerie light
of the gallery dugan left the ad-
joining cell at the same time

  you three are to go before the
high priest they were told

  graham looked at the nearest
guard and experienced a distinct
shock colors were unnatural in the
orange light of course but it was
not that which caused the shivers
to chase down his spine it was the
fellows eyes more than anything
they were large and unblinking
with expressionless pupils that must
have been three times the diameter
of the average mans fish eyes
this guard as were they all was
even taller than graham-probably
six feet six inches naked save for
a loin cloth his skin showed a sickly
lemon hue in the orange illumina-
tion by daylight it must have been
ghastly white chest deep arms
long and dangling legs unbeliev-
ably skinny and bowed furtively
examining the others of the guards
graham saw that they were all
marked by the same characteristics
and they talked english

  the prisoners were marched down
the gallery past the long row of
cells from which scared faces
peered out at them between the
bars in one cell graham saw a
delicate slip of a girl who was sob-
bing wretchedly he went suddenly
sick

  from the gallery they were taken
into a long passage which sloped

sharply downward four guards
preceded them and five more
brought up the rear at the end of
the passage a door opened into a
circular room with high arched
ceiling sitting cross-legged on the
cushions of a small raised platform
in the middle of the room was a
man who stared at them coldly with
fish eyes like those of the guards

  you will draw near to me he
said curtly that i may converse
with you

  graham answered hotly what
right-

  a wave of the seated ones hand
silenced him there was something
commanding in that gesture and
besides one of the guards had prod-
ded grahams ribs with his mace

  it is for me to question not for
you unblinkingly the one on the
platform regarded them

  under the spell of his gaze they
approached the platform saying
nothing the face of this man was
as sickly hued as those of the
guards but it was a look of keen
intelligence and a haughtiness that
bespoke high authority an oddly
shaped turban surmounted his head
and he was attired in a flowing robe
which orange-lighted from above
was a muddy brown in color the
fingers of his left hand long and
tapered toyed with a metal orna-
ment which hung on his breast

  since you three are the latest ar-
rivals it is necessary that you be
apprised of your position and as-
signed to your tasks i am ithen
high priest and ruler of kafeja and
i have brought you to my realm
with a definite purpose in view in
due course of time that purpose will
be revealed to you and you shall be
-freed meanwhile you are to con-
sider yourselves not as prisoners
but as guests however we of ka-
feja will insist that you remain as
telegraph plateau



paying guests you are to pay for
your sustenance with labor each in
accordance with his particular quali-
fications therefore you will each
of you in turn advise me as to your
abilities

  huh-not prisoners scoffed
graham sleeping in cells

  ithen silenced him with a frigid
stare and perry was nudging him
to warn him they must learn as
much as possible regarding this
realm of ithens and play for time
to make plans for escape if such a
thing were possible

  it seemed that the priests had
charge of everything in kafeja

  perry explained that he was an
air pilot but added that his hobby
was scientific research he was as-
signed to work with the priests of
the laboratory and two guards led
him from the room

  dugan told haltingly of his ex-
perience with internal-combustion
engines and was sent to the priests
of power generation

  im a radio operator said
graham

  ithen eyed him from head to foot
since we are in need of no radio
operators he said i shall assign
you to the priests of the fisheries
take him away guards

  for the next half hour graham
entirely forgot his indignation in
the wonder that came to him two
of the guards led him to a car that
hung on a cable and this car slid
rapidly through a long tunnel and
out into an enormous cavern where
sights met his eyes that he would
never have imagined in his wildest
fancies

  the cable swung over the city of
kafeja and except for the myriad
of orange lights overhead graham
would have thought of himself as
flying over a surface city of a
strange world where the only colors

were browns and reds and yellows
nothing was white since white
light is composed of all colors of
the spectrum and here half of the
spectrum was missing many ob-
jects were black and graham won-
dered how many of these might
show as blue green or violet if ex-
posed to white light

  aside from the colors the city
was still a strange one there were
no streets or avenues but only the
spaces between the irregularly ar-
ranged groups of circular dwellings
some of the flat-topped round edi-
fices were large some small there
was no uniformity to anything in
kafaja it was like nothing so much
as a huge tank farm of an oil
field but arranged with no regard
to symmetry

  a maze of cables stretched over
the rooftops and these crossed and
crisscrossed in all directions cars
traveling along these cables made
frequent stops to load and unload
then vanished in the tunnels which
honeycombed the cavern walls
there seemed to be no other means
of transportation

  in approximately the center of
the city was an open space like a
public square here there was a
spiral promenade that wound up-
ward and inward from the ground
level to a flat circular space from
which rose an astonishing monu-
ment this was in the shape of a
huge sphere which rotated slowly
on an inclined axis and to which
were appended a small sphere close
by and a distant larger sphere that
was lighted brilliantly to an almost
pure yellow undoubtedly repre-
sentations of the earth the moon
and the sun

  graham would have questioned
the guards regarding the monument
but they had been so sullenly silent
that he refrained


astounding stories

  outside the city itself were broad
fields extending to the cavern walls
fields of stunted vegetation of no
kind that grew on the earths sur-
face and obviously cultivated in-
tensively kafejans were at work
in these fields and numbers of the
captives at one point graham saw
a fenced-in area where a great many
queer animals were grazing he had
only a fleeting glimpse of these but
they appeared to be a species of
huge lizard as large as cattle but
with long tails and flat heads they
crawled flat on their bellies with
stumpy legs outstretched from their
bloated bodies

  then the car in which he was rid-
ing had slid into a tunnel mouth
and was thundering through a dark
passage

 when it came to a stop the
guards turned him over to a brown-
robed priest who led him to a large
cavern that was walled with smooth
metal like the hull of the sphere
which had captured them hun-
dreds of men were laboring in this
cavern in a fishy stench that was
almost unbearable most of the
workers were kafejans whose un-
covered bodies were spattered with
oil and blood from the carcasses
they were cutting up but many were
captives from the surface world who
had stripped to the waist but re-
tained their trousers their bodies
coppery colored in the orange il-
lumination formed a strange con-
trast with the sickly hue of the
kafejans a number of the brown-
robed priests supervised the work
and were as dictatorial to kafejan
as to captive

  you are not to work here said
the priest who was leading graham
across the slippery floor

  these were welcome words to the
erstwhile radio man whose stomach
revolted at the odors and the slime

and the very look of the sea mon-
sters they were cleaning and hack-
ing to pieces where then he
asked

  the priest grinned maliciously
you go out into the depths to fight
these monsters and to bring them
in he said

  they had passed through a low
archway and now emerged in an-
other cavern which was like the in-
terior of an enormously enlarged
battleship turret graham saw what
appeared to be breech mechanisms
of a dozen giant guns and large
ovoids of steel that might have been
projectiles for these guns

  many of the unrobed kafejans
were here and they crowded close
to examine the newcomer the
priest drove them back with a storm
of angry gutturals that were quite
unintelligible to graham then se-
lected two from their number and
bid them draw near they came
groveling

  these are to be your compan-
ions he told graham they are
igor and freng igor speaks your
language imperfectly the other not
at all i am sure you will enjoy
their company

 company you mean-

  you are to go with them in the
next varshar which ventures into
the valley of the devilfish there to
battle the largest which can be
found and to bring back the spoils
no more than that the priest
turned on his heel and left the way
they had come

  igor grinned showing muddy-
brown fangs what you name red
man he asked in not unfriendly
tone

  graham

  good grayum you new here
yes you see now much funny
go after varsa

  varsa
telegraph plateau



  um-priest call deveelfeesh
oh graham could think of
nothing else to say if he was to
go out in one of those metal ovoids
with these two freaks hed have to
go and no getting out of it as a
matter of fact he was curious as
to the means used in fishing the
depths of the ocean and actually
looking forward to the experience
with a measure of excitement

  igor and freng moved to one of
the ovoids which rested in a cradle
before the open breech of one of
the guns

  this varshar said igor

  graham looked up at an ovoid that
was some twenty feet in length and
probably twelve feet in its greatest
diameter he saw that the outer
surface was smooth seamless a
circular door in its side was open
and the interior was lighted with
the usual orange glow there was
no sign of propeller or rudders else
he might have taken it for a small
submarine no it was a projectile
igor said you go up grayum
to be shot out into the depths
in this thing would be an adventure
all grahams doubts evaporated and
he was up the steps and in through
the door in nothing flat the two
kafejans followed and the door was
bolted to its seat from inside

  lets go said graham looking
curiously about him

iii

  the shell of the ovoid must
have been enormously thick for
there was hardly room for the three
of them to move around amidst the
clutter of machinery in the single
apartment graham commenced ex-
amining the mechanisms with avid
interest but was stopped by igor

  no time look now said the
kafejan we start quick here

lie down this place he indicated
a shelf at the end of the compart-
ment a shelf that was provided
with three grooves each of suffi-
cient size to hold a man

  freng flung himself face down in
one of the grooves with his head
toward the gleaming curved wall
and graham followed suit igor
was at his side in the next moment
his fingers resting on a series of
small levers that were arranged at
the end of the groove in which he
lay

  there came a heavy jar and a
lurching forward of the ovoid the
hiss of compressed air graham
knew then that the guns were no
more than huge torpedo tubes and
that the ovoid had gone through
into the sea there was a swift
sense of increased pressure a hol-
low echo in his ears then the
lights in the ovoid went out and
the machinery started with a sharp
rising whine

  he had been wrong this was a
submarine though he had not the
faintest idea as to its method of
locomotion it lunged forward un-
der its own power whatever that
power might be the great torpedo
tubes were in reality only air locks
which were provided for the launch-
ing of these small vessels into the
enormous pressure of the depths

  the gleaming wall before gra-
hams eyes suddenly became trans-
parent and he saw the ocean bed
for the first time it was a sight
he would have gone a long way to
witness

  no daylight could penetrate to
this depth but the scene was clearly
visible in an orange glow like the
artificial lighting of kafeja it was
incomprehensible to graham he
knew that the long-wave-length
light rays near the red end of the
spectrum had much less penetrat-


astounding stories

ing power than the shorter ones at
the violet end and he did not
learn until later that this illumina-
tion of the depths was accomplished
by a broadcast electrical energy
which made suspended matter and
even molecules of water luminous
by its excitation

  he was looking out over an area
of rugged peaks and wide valleys
on the peaks were forests of slen-
der perpendicular vegetation in
the valleys broad sandy plains with
occasional clumps of marine plant
life that grew close to the bottom
rather than extending to a great
height upward as did that on the
peaks

  constantly crossing his field of
vision and often coming very near
to the transparent forward end of
the ovoid was a multitude of swim-
ming things most of these being
queerly shaped and quite unlike the
fish that are to be found near the
surface twice a finny monster that
was bigger than the ovoid came to
look them over with saber-toothed
jaws opened wide each time igor
pulled a lever and there was a jet
of inky fluid which drove the big
fish away after a second visit he
did not return

  the ovoid was progressing down
a gentle slope at a rapid rate now
keeping to a distance of about
twenty fathoms from the bottom
many huge crabs could be seen on
this slope great fellows of the hard-
shelled variety that moved with dig-
nified deliberation

  good place find varsa said igor
varsa eat birji

  graham presumed that birji were
these huge crabs

  suddenly freng hissed excitedly
seshu ig seshu

  hoh gloated igor big fella
big deveelfeesh see grayum
they had reached the bottom of

the slope and there crawling on
three of its arms with the remain-
ing five waving in the orange-lit
waters was a huge creature of the
genus cephalopoda a giant octo-
pus such as those of which graham
had heard tales but never believed
to exist this specimen must have
been thirty feet in diameter if laid
flat with arms outstretched

  the ovoid nosed down and came
to rest on the bottom directly in
front of the octopus the creature
saw them at once and halted its for-
ward movement standing with pow-
erful jaws opened wide staring eyes
regarding this intruder balefully

 cripes breathed graham
what do we do now

 wait for him attack igor
stated calmly then go out catch
big fella alive

  go out into this pressure of
water graham could not credit
his hearing

  hoh not in water na na you
see igor was manipulating his
levers inching the ovoid closer to
the monster

  grahams scalp twitched with the
rising of his hair

  then the huge octopus charged
the ovoid graham yelled as its
great bulk flung against the thick
glass before him he had a glimpse
of the cavernous mouth and the sin-
ister eyes before his vision was shut
off the ovoid rolled drunkenly
and there was a slithering crunch as
the creatures jaws closed on the
nose of the vessel and slipped off
igor jerked at his levers and the
ovoid seemed to settle down into
the mud of the bottom the lights
flashed on

  now make ready go out said
igor he started a machine which
had not operated previously then
turned off the lights once more

  looking out graham saw that
telegraph plateau



the octopus had backed away in sur-
prise and as he watched a bubble
seemed to emanate from the ovoid
a bubble of air that grew rapidly in
size until it inclosed the ovoid and
the monster in a hemisphere that
was bounded only by water push-
ing back the ocean itself until there
was a clear space air filled where
they would be able to fight the
ghastly creature-or try to

  graham gasped but igor the
pressure we must be hundreds of
fathoms deep and the air pressure
must be terrific out there

  na no pressure you see same
here as kafeja

 what raised the water then
what holds it back

  igor shrugged pointing to the
machine whose intricacies were as
mysterious to him as to graham
there was the hiss of compressed
air flowing out into the bubble

 but graham objected why
cant you kill him from inside this
thing with a torpedo or a ray
or something

  must bring back alive meat no
good if not

 so what graham could con-
ceive of no practical method of cap-
turing the monstrous creature alive
already it had charged the ovoid
a second time and even now its
tentacles were slithering over the
outer surface of the forward end

  nasty things those tentacles as
thick as a mans waist where they
joined the ugly body and tapering
down to sensitive curling ends
covered with suction cups on the
under side cups that clung to the
thick glass tenaciously

 igor said you see grayum
take this and this we go out
he thrust a four-foot length of
steel rod and a coil of rope into the
unwilling hands of the ex-radio
man

  the door opened and the three
of them were outside graham took
a deep breath and found the air
good his ears sang a bit but there
was no sensation of greatly exces-
sive pressure he looked up fear-
fully at the arched wall of water
overhead then forgot all about it
as a tentacle came sliding down
over the top of the ovoid and curled
around his neck yelling in horror
he banged at it with the steel rod
and it uncurled

 igor shouted approval freng
was screaming hoh hoh and
pounding away at another tentacle
as he flung his coil of rope over the
creatures body which towered
above them the monster charged
him but he eluded the thrashing
tentacles nimbly igor took advan-
tage of this distraction of the
things attention to fling another
coil of rope about the body and
make it fast

  graham saw how it was done now
and rushed in with steel rod flail-
ing and rope ready the creature
turned and charged again this time
on igor freng made fast another
loop of rope in the meantime

  suddenly the octopus changed its
tactics and backed away freng
made haste to run the end of his
rope through a ring that was set
in the hull of the ovoid he made
it fast just as the monster reached
the limit of the air bubbles diame-
ter graham blinked as he saw it
back against a solid wall of water
it could not enter that wall held
fast as had the wall of the tube
down which the capturing sphere
had come it held against the crea-
tures bulk as unyielding as if it
were a wall of steel the octopus
made a hideous screeching sound
and charged again

  this time graham looped his rope
around the bases of two tentacles


astounding stories

and drew it tight he was breath-
ing hard from his exertion and with
the excitement of battle this was
real sport no further thought of
the danger of it entered his mind
now that the horror of it had worn
off he drew the other end of his
rope through one of the rings on
the ovoid extra coils had been
dumped out through the door be-
fore they came out and he grabbed
up one of these

  then he froze in his tracks for a
bloodcurdling shriek rang out
within the narrow confines of the
bubble he looked up to see igor
raised high in the air by one of
those slimy tentacles which had
wound around his middle freng
was clubbing the monster with his
rod but this seemed not to daunt
it at all

  the enormous mouth of the thing
was open and the tentacle that held
igor was curving down to thrust
the wriggling man between those
jagged-toothed crushing jaws
graham lunged forward and flung
his rod with all his might it was
a lucky throw for the rod turning
end over end entered the monsters
mouth and wedged in an upright
position the jaws closed down
but only a little way when the rod
became firmly embedded in flesh and
bone the creature screeched with
the pain of it and dropped igor into
the mud

 both freng and graham made
other ropes fast then and igor was
soon with them it was not long
until they had the monster trussed
up like a turkey and lashed to the
ovoid

  hoh said igor you do good
grayum we all finish take big
fella back now

  the trip back was somewhat dif-
ferent from that coming out the
bubble collapsed slowly when igor

stopped the machine which had pro-
duced it and they returned at a
leisurely pace on account of towing
the monster which must be kept
alive

 freng lay on his back in his
groove and went to sleep but igor
was voluble graham tried to draw
him out tried to learn all he could
about kafeja and its inhabitants
about the great sphere which had
gone to the oceans surface to cap-
ture them and about the ovoids and
their method of operation but
igor could talk only of the fight
with the monster and of his rescue
he was extremely grateful and
vowed that he would return the
favor though being somevhat vague
as to the manner in which it might
be returned

 they saw a number of octopi on
the way back but none so large as
the one they had captured the
sea was filled with life most of the
swimming creatures being of species
never encountered near the surface
there were fish with eyes at the
ends of long antennas that projected
from their heads enormous squids
that squirmed on the bottom and
many giant crustaceans graham
saw one of the latter that was much
like an ordinary lobster but with a
body as long as a mans and with
claws that would have cut a man in
two he judged that the depth was
very great

  at length they reached their ob-
jective which showed as a curved
metal wall that bulged from the side
of a sheer cliff the ovoid did not
enter through a tube similar to the
one it had been discharged from
but plunged into an enormous air
lock where it came to rest

 there were several minutes of
waiting while the water was emp-
tied from the lock and then the
door of the ovoid was opened they
telegraph plateau



were greeted by a great clamor
when they came out a dozen ka-
fejans were in the lock exclaiming
at the size of the cephalopod as they
loosed the lashings igor was not
insensible of the praise heaped upon
him but he affected an easy noncha-
lance of manner and led his com-
panions immediately to the room
from which they had started the
voyage

  here they found considerable ex-
citement the priest who had as-
signed graham to the ovoid was
there and with him was ithen the
high priest ithen was berating the
other priest but left off his tirade
when he saw graham

 igor bowed from the waist and
muttered something in his own
tongue but ithen waved him aside
with impatience going instead to
graham

  he seemed to be greatly agitated
and grasped the americans arms
peering intently into his face you
are entirely unharmed he asked

 graham chuckled this sudden
solicitude somehow struck him as
being funny not a scratch on
me he said airily

  it is well the high priest in-
toned and now you are to return
to your quarters for the remainder
of the waking period

  ithen turned again to the other
priest and ripped out a stream of
harsh kafejan gutturals that some-
how sounded far from approving

  him get hell for send you out
igor whispered ithen want no
harm come your kind want keep
alive and well

 again graham chuckled what-
ever his origin a man of another
race learning to speak english is
bound to pick up the cuss words
and igor was no exception

 but there was food for serious
thought in the kafejans last words

the priests wanted to keep the cap-
tives alive and healthy did they
graham sobered thinking involun-
tarily of the octopus that too
had been kept alive-up to a cer-
tain point

iv

 the prison quarters
were more spacious than graham
had imagined and included besides
the cell blocks large mess rooms
and kitchens a series of reception
rooms and a well-stocked library
the guard who had accompanied
him from the fisheries left him in
the latter

  there were volumes here printed
in many languages and on every
conceivable subject from child rear-
ing to astronomy examining some
of the books graham found identi-
fying marks on their title pages
such as u s s rover  h m s
leicester scandinavian-american
line and one n a a t ice-
landia a recent addition there
were none he could find that were
printed in the language of kafeja

  he wrinkled his brow in thought
obviously the priests of kafeja had
engaged in their kidnaping opera-
tions for a period of years and had
captured steamships as well as air-
craft it had been more than a dec-
ade since the rover was reported
lost at sea the secrets of many
such disappearances were to be
found here in kafeja but the pur-
pose of it all was extremely puz-
zling to graham certainly the
kafejans were not thinking of mak-
ing war on the outside world there
were not enough of them for that
nor could they be holding the cap-
tives for ransom for the gold of the
nations would be of no use to them
here what then

  a cough from behind one of the
book racks interrupted his medita-


astounding stories

tions and he moved around the end
of the case to see who was there
the cougher was a middle-aged man
who sat reading at one of the tables
and whose arm was in a sling
graham addressed him

 hello stranger mind talking
to a fellow captive

 glad to but there was no
cheerfulness in the mans voice or
in his gloomy stare as he closed his
book my names townsend

  im graham of n a a t

 oh-one of those they brought
in last night

  thats right graham had never
heard such a sepulchral voice nor
seen so morbid a look on a mans
face he thought townsend must be
an undertaker

  it developed that he had been just
that-a mortician he called it-in
canton ohio and that he had been
a prisoner here two years having
been a passenger in a private trans-
oceanic plane which graham re-
called as having been reported lost
at sea about that long before he
was forced to work in the fields by
the kafejans and had broken his
arm a week ago yes the priests
were taking good care of him

 but my friend he said sol-
emnly they are doing it for no
good reason we are doomed i tell
you-all of us are doomed each
day some of our number vanish
never to be seen again

 what becomes of them

  none of us know but it is firmly
believed by many of the prisoners
including myself that those who
disappear are sacrificed to the pagan
gods of kafeja by the priests
graham had considered this pos-
sibility but dismissed it as too fan-
tastic lets talk about something
more pleasant he suggested since
im new here and youre an old-
timer so to speak i wish youd tell

me more about this place and the
inhabitants you must have learned
quite a bit in two years im in the
dark about it all

 townsend shook his head they
do not talk much but i do know
this the priests rule kafeja with
an iron hand kafeja is a hierarchy
and has been for countless genera-
tions there are twelve hundred of
the priests and about twenty times
that many subjects this place is
not as you may have supposed the
remains of some lost continent like
legendary atlantis the people are
descendants of a race that was
driven from the surface two thou-
sand years ago they were forced
to live in caverns and subterranean
passages and the ancient grudge
against the surface peoples has been
handed down from generation to
generation as near as i can make
out they came originally from the
scandinavian peninsula and were
forced deeper and deeper into the
earths crust until finally they
reached this point under the bed of
the ocean i presume you are aware
of the fact that this region of bot-
tom is known as telegraph plateau
are you not

 graham had not known this and
he admitted it

 well that is what oceanogra-
phers call it it begins at a point
between the grand banks of new-
foundland and iceland and covers a
vast area where the ocean varies be-
tween two hundred and fifty and

two thousand fathoms-

 yes but the people-tell me
more about them

  townsend looked around to see if
any one was within earshot and
lowered his voice ive overheard
some mutterings he whispered
there is much dissatisfaction now
among the common kafejans and a
growing mistrust of the priests

            ast-
telegraph plateau



the subjects are beginning to have
doubts even of the legend

 the legend graham was be-
coming more confused as his in-
formant went on with his gloomy
dissertation

  i forgot you had not heard of
it the legend is one that has been
drilled into the common people by
the priests for many generations
and has to do with the coming of
the surface visitors-ourselves all
through the ages these kafejans
have entertained hopes of once more
dwelling outside-in the open air
you have undoubtedly seen their
monument which expresses this sen-
timent well the legend has it that
their migration to the land of sun-
shine is to commence when surface
people equal in number to their own
shall have been brought to kafeja
as sacrifices to the gods of the an-
cients and now that the time is
drawing near they are whispering
among themselves the commoners
for some reason i have been unable
to learn believe that the priests are
deceiving them there will be trou-
ble you mark my words town-
sends long face lengthened even
more but none of us will be here
to witness it he concluded mo-
rosely

 graham said cheer up man
you havent actually seen any of
these sacrifices have you

  no but i have seen many of the
captives taken away and then
there is the legend

  at that moment two of the almost
naked guards hove into view and
approached townsend you are
among those chosen for this pe-
riod one of them told the man

  the swarthy color drained from
his face leaving it the same sickly
yellow as that of the guard but
townsend was game he straight-
ened his shoulders and accompanied

  ast-

them without a word his gaze as
he looked back at graham seemed
to say i told you so

  after he had gone the library was
an empty echoing place and a
measure of townsends gloom de-
scended on the lanky radio man he
sat for a time racking his brains
for an explanation other than that
to which he had just listened then
more uncertain than ever and be-
coming restless he sauntered into
an adjoining room which happened
to be the gymnasium a kafejan
guard was here and two husky cap-
tives were performing on the paral-
lel bars the former looked at
graham askance the two captives
jabbered at him in french of which
he understood not a word he
passed on into the assembly room

  before long the prisoners were
streaming in from their labors some
utterly discouraged of mien and
sagging with weariness others not
seeming to take the matter at all
seriously numbers of kafejan
guards were here but they paid no
attention to the captives so long as
order was maintained graham
started looking for perry and du-
gan

  the hall was almost filled before
he located the pilot perrys eyes
were shining it was obvious he had
spent a profitable time with the
priests of the laboratory graham
drew him aside and told him of his
own experiences winding up with
the story of townsend

 hm-m-m said perry when he
had finished the business of the
legend will bear investigating but
graham let me tell you these-
priests are nobodys fools when it
comes to knowledge of science they
have discovered the secret of grav-
ity and are using a similar force in
almost all their activities the
ovoid you were in was propelled by


astounding stories

a repulsive force of this nature the
bubble in which you fought the oc-
topus was produced by degravitiz-
ing the vast weight of water above
compressed air was released in it
at atmospheric pressure to enable
you to breathe the waterspout
was produced in the same manner
and the sphere which captured us
was lifted through the opening it
left behind by a similar gravity-
repulsing energy believe it or
not

 that explained many things to
graham but still left him cold he
was more interested in the possibil-
ity of escaping from the place than
in the science of the priests so
what he asked dryly

 perry sobered you mean what
about ourselves

 sure what are we here for-
and how do we get out

  i havent learned much that will
be of help admitted perry but
there are some things for one
these priests are not interested in
the gods of the ancients they are
scientists i suppose they have kept
up the pretense of priesthood to
fool their subjects into continued
submission but their prime interest
is in physical research they had
to become scientists ages ago when
the earthquakes cut them off from
the outside world they were forced
to discover means of generating
their own oxygen of providing arti-
ficial illumination of growing crops
and of conquering the enormous
pressure of the waters which hem
them in they have done much and
will do more youll see

  graham was not to be sidetracked
but perry he said there are
about a thousand captives here
maybe more are we to stand idly
by and see the worst happen to them
and to us weve got to think up
some way of getting out of here

  right but itll take a little
time im afraid well have to
watch our step learn what we can
and then make plans

  meanwhile some are being taken
every day-like townsend look
perry-do you think you can learn
how that sphere is worked and how
to get to it

  i believe so it is near the labora-
tories and thats our only chance
at that perry was thoroughly
aroused now ill go after the dope
to-morrow

 the gong rang then and there
was a rush for the mess rooms fin-
ishing their conversation

 they did not see dugan until
after they had finished their meal
of fish and unfamiliar but savory
vegetables when they did en-
counter him it was only for a mo-
ment while they were being re-
turned to their cells but graham
lost no time in questioning him
after they had been locked in for
the sleeping period hugging the
cell wall on the side nearest to du-
gans and talking to him through
the bars he could not see the me-
chanic but could hear his every
whisper

 what do you know he asked
him

  gosh theyve got some engines
down in the power plant theyre
gravity motors run by chargin and
dischargin with attractive and re-
pulsive forces they-

  never mind that graham inter-
rupted lets talk about the mess
were in and how to get out of it
did you hear anything from other
prisoners

  no but i did see a fight in one
o the engine rooms

  a fight with a prisoner

 no a kafejan mechanic at-
tacked one o the priests and was
shot down they had a big argu-
telegraph plateau



ment but i couldnt understand a
word

 shot down was the mechanic
killed

  gosh yes burned to a cinder

 perry was crowded close behind
graham at the cell wall ask him
what kind of a weapon the priest
used he whispered

  graham relayed the question

  oh it was a sort o pistol that
shot a roarin red flame ugh

 a guard was coming down the
gallery and the men ceased talking
graham and perry drew back from
their door as the guard halted be-
fore it then graham had a good
look at the kafejan

  igor he exclaimed

  it was his friend of the ovoid
smiling he explained his presence

 yes igor have friend who fix
new job igor guard now

 a wild hope was forming in
grahams mind you asked for
this job yourself he inquired
then as igor nodded what for

 maybe igor can pay grayum for
save life

 how-softly

 will see but only grayum
others not count now no more
talk at door igor no care but old
guards hear will change cell if
hear talk

 the big kafejan left them then
and continued his march down the
gallery

  now what do you think of that
breathed graham

  i think wed better take his ad-
vice ve can lie on our cots and
talk there without being overheard
its only talking between cells
thats risky perry had moved into
the shadows

 they lay for a long time after
that discussing the situation but
reaching no conclusion whatever
igor passed their door several times

and each time paused to look in
but he did not speak to graham
again

  you made a good friend of him
said perry whats more he may
be a lot of help

  uh-huh the orange glow had
dimmed to the deeper reddish
gloom of the sleeping period and
graham was hardly awake

  he dozed off then partly roused
at a soft call from perry

  yes he answered thickly

  and the last thing he heard be-
fore falling sound asleep was per-
rys drawl do you know i believe
this orange light of theirs has some-
thing to do with it im going to
look into that to-morrow-

v

 time was measured in
kafeja by means of gyroscope-oper-
ated clocks which functioned by
the earths rotation a full day
comprising one waking period and
one sleeping period was thus of
the same duration as that to which
the captives were accustomed so it
made little difference to them that
the kafejan timepieces had ten ma-
jor divisions instead of twelve and
that each of these hours had one
hundred subdivisions in place of the
usual sixty minutes the prisoners
counted their days by labor and
meal times and by the darkened pe-
riods for sleep

  evidently ithen had changed his
mind entirely about the assignment
to the fisheries for graham was sep-
arated from his friends after the
first meal of the second waking
period and sent to the fields outside
the city with about fifteen other
prisoners

 he found one man among this
group of captives whom he knew-
sven nystrum an old-timer with


astounding stories

n a a t and recently appointed
mate of the liner icelandia the
two managed to get together when
the cable car landed them near the
patch of cultivated ground in which
they were to work

  all told about fifty men were in
this field all except their own group
being kafejans two priests were
in charge being closely watched
it was necessary for graham and
nystrum to converse guardedly
your first day nystrum asked
second they had me octopus
hunting yesterday

  what do you think of it all
you should ask me said gra-
ham youve been here longer
what do you think

  theres a hundred different
hunches among the prisoners but
mine is that the priests are putting
one over on these other poor slobs
i figure the priests are planning to
skip out of here and leave their un-
der dogs behind

  but what about us what was
the idea in bringing us here i
dont get it at all

  nystrum dropped his voice to a
whisper ah thats the joker i
figure there is something they lack
in order to live on the surface and
whatever it is theyre getting it
from us

 you mean-

  i dont know what but-

  one of the priests was approach-
ing and they ceased talking the
field was a slushy expanse of dwarf
bushes on which grew a bright-red
fruit about the size of ordinary
plums they had been given hamp-
ers and were engaged in gathering
such of the fruit as was soft and
elastic to the touch the priest ex-
amined the contents of their con-
tainers nodded approval and passed
on

  captain morris went out yester-

day nystrum said feelingly when
he had gone

  they took him away with those
others

  he fought them off until they
paralyzed him

  paralyzed him i thought they
wanted to keep us alive and well
this did not fit in with what graham
had experienced the previous day

  nystrum shrugged maybe its
only temporary this paralysis i
dont know anyway ive seen a
dozen go out that way

  graham thought this over and
could arrive at no explanation it
seems as if trouble is brewing be-
tween the priests and the others
he offered after a period of silence
his hamper was growing weighty

  you bet watch the kafejan
workers and youll see signs
watching furtively graham saw
that this was so but to him it
seemed that the sullen looks of the
laboring kafejans were directed at
his own kind rather than at the two
priests he remarked on this to
nystrum

  by george youre right his
friend answered funny too it
was the other way round yesterday
suddenly an uproar arose at the
far end of the field and they saw
that a number of the kafejan work-
men had rushed a group of prison-
ers the priests were running to-
ward the scene of the disturbance
shouting frenziedly

  graham and nystrum dropped
their hampers and hurdling the
rows of bushes went to join the be-
sieged captives

  but the priests were there before
them clubbing the queer pistols
they carried and going in like
whirlwinds of fury heads cracked
right and left and they were the
heads of kafejans the priests
were defending the prisoners
telegraph plateau



 look graham exclaimed
theyve got the captives free and
the kafejans are massing against
their priests

  nystrum said solemnly wed
best keep out of it

  a half dozen of the kafejan work-
ers were stretched motionless on the
wet earth and the rest of them con-
verged swiftly on the two priests
one of the priests raised his voice
angrily but was shouted down by
the excited laborers the captives
for the moment protected by the
waving pistols of the priests were
banding together and drawing away
from the storm center graham
and nystrum joined their ranks
ready for anything

  the kafejans charged and the
pistols of the priests spat flame that
roared mightily and brought agon-
ized shrieks from the foremost of
the attacking party graham saw
three charred bodies toppled head-
long but the maddened kafejans
still came on again and again the
searing flames spouted and other
screaming natives were burned
down but now they were upon the
priests and graham saw one of
them slump to his knees and bend
backward then he was trampled
underfoot by the howling mob

  but the second priest dodged the
rush of natives and sent in a steady
blast of flame as they wheeled it
was a devastating fire and mowed
them down like sheep only about
ten were left on their feet now and
these turned and ran yelling and
whimpering

  graham saw that a cable car had
stopped at the landing platform
from it came another priest with
two guards and these rushed to the
assistance of the first priest all
four ran after the fleeing kafejans

  the group of captives stood ir-
resolute frightened speechless but

graham saw in this circumstance
the opportunity he sought

  i can run that cable car he
shouted come on all of you
its our chance to escape

 nystrum grinned delightedly
its a go snap into it everybody
before they come back from the
chase

  graham bent over the body of the
fallen priest and saw at once that
his neck was broken he removed
the flame pistol from the stiffening
fingers and pocketed it

  by the time they had all the cap-
tives in the car the priests and the
two guards were returning two
fingers of flame reached out but
failed to reach them before graham
had found the starting lever the
cable car started with a lurch and
was speeding over kafeja toward
the far wall of the great cavern

 where do we go from here
asked nystrum who sat beside him

  the other captives were demon-
strating noisily some of them jubi-
lant others doubtful and some be-
wailing the fate they were sure was
to overtake them

 depends on where this cable
leads graham replied then with
a jerk of his thumb over his shoul-
der better talk to them back there
and get em to quiet down therell
be work to do and some scrapping
like as not

  nystrum argued with their com-
panions while the car sped toward
a tunnel mouth that loomed ahead
graham saw the semicircular meet-
ing place of the kafejans which
faced a balcony that stood out from
the wall some twenty feet above the
cavern floor on the balcony was
an altar and a replica of the monu-
ment in the square they were
nearing the domain of the priests

  then the car had plunged into
red semidarkness and graham drew


astounding stories

back on the lever to slacken their
speed he was glad he had watched
the operator of the car he had come
out on glad that the control was
simple

  no real plan was in his mind and
he was beginning to entertain some
doubts as to the wisdom of their
move but anything was better
than submitting tamely as they had
been doing besides there was now
a chance to learn something definite
regarding the mysterious activities
of the priests

  he saw brighter light ahead and
slowed the car almost to a stop a
landing station was there before
them and the end of the tunnel
he stopped the car

  itll be too dangerous to go on
he called back to the others what
do you say we get out here and
look for a side passage-weve
passed several of them

  some of the prisoners agreed
eagerly others half-heartedly it
was plain that many of their num-
ber would prove to be of little help
in a concerted move for freedom
but they dropped one by one from
the car door to the floor of the tun-
nel and followed as graham led the
way back through the red-lit gloom

  presently they came to a side pas-
sage where the light was better and
of the familiar orange tint graham
entered this cautiously and saw that
it led a long way into the rock wall
without turning he called to the
others to follow

  a faint throbbing of machinery
was in their ears and this became
more ndticeable as they progressed
graham imagined that they were
not far from the power plant nys-
trum was at his side when they came
to the first cross passage which they
inspected carefully before going
farther the cross passage too was
empty

  there was some grumbling among
those following but whispered
words of caution relayed back were
effective in silencing them it was
no time to be disagreeing among
themselves

  then a short way ahead a hur-
rying priest turned into the passage
he was bound in the same direction
as theirs so did not see them cat-
footed graham sprinted after him
and brought him down by judicious
use of his pistol butt a quick
search of his robe brought forth an-
other of the flame pistols and now
nystrum was armed

  grahams spirits rose

  the noise is growing fainter
said nystrum when they had gone
a short way farther

  what he said was true evidently
they had passed by the generating
plant for the hum of machinery was
definitely behind them now and was
hardly noticeable

  suddenly the passage widened out
and they emerged on a balcony that
lined a small cavern which inclosed
a circular pool evidently a bath-
ing place of the priests fortunately
none of the priests were here so
they moved along the balcony until
they came to another small passage
they entered this and proceeded at
right angles to the direction in
which they had come

  were getting nowhere fast
said graham and-

  what he had been about to say
was cut short by a terrific shock
that rocked the passage and threw
him flat a thunderous roar arose
then died down to a menacing rum-
ble a second shock followed and
other thunderings which at last
trailed off into silence

  some of those behind set up a
clamor

  cripes yelled graham its
only a slight earthquake now be
telegraph plateau



quiet before we give ourselves
away

 he scrambled to his feet and
pressed on with nystrum beside
him the others trailed along

  and then a hundred yards ahead
a score of priests streamed into the
passage

  graham found the release of his
pistol and sent its flame roaring in
their direction nystrum dupli-
cated his action but the flames were
far short of their intended marks
the range of these weapons was not
greater than half the distance and
the priests were retreating rather
than advancing

  come on nystrum-after them

 graham suited action to his
words hoping to get within range
in this narrow passage they should
be able to hold their own against
the superior force provided the
charges of their pistols held out

  but the priests fell back keeping
out of range they were not armed
with flame pistols but held short
tubes in their hands that were fun-
nel shaped and terminated in large
bulbs at the small end

  a chorus of shouting came from
the prisoners in the rear and the
sound of hand-to-hand fighting

  were caught panted nystrum
other priests have attacked from
behind

  i was a damn fool to think we
could get away with it graham
said bitterly but he kept reaching
out with the flame from his pistol
in the hope that he was gaining on
the retreating priests

  it was no use always the flame
fell short and after a time there
was no flame at all the pistol was
empty and so was nystrums

  the priests in front seeing this
stopped their retreat and began to
advance bedlam reigned behind
priests and prisoners were in a des-

perate battle the captives some
of them were putting up a good
fight but to no avail they were
outnumbered and quickly overpow-
ered

 graham and nystrum plunged
forward to meet the robed ones who
were closing in on them at least
they could leave their marks before
being taken

  but an unknown and invisible en-
ergy was radiating from those fun-
nel-shaped weapons an energy that
was to render them helpless gra-
ham first sensed it when he stum-
bled repeatedly a leering and
ghastly face was before him the un-
healthy fish-eyed face of a priest
he wanted to drive his fist into that
face and see it go down in the haze
that was forming to blur his vision
but he was unable to raise his arm
curses rose to his lips but no sound
came forth his step was lagging
it was as if he was loaded down
with a burden he could not carry
he slumped to the floor of the pas-
sage helpless

  turning his head with an effort
he saw nystrum in like condition
saw the rest of the prisoners being
marched off by the priests who had
recaptured them so easily

  only a grunt escaped him but it
was fraught with disgust

vi

 this was not the paralysis
of which nystrum had spoken
graham felt the strength returning
to his limbs as soon as the energy
of the funnellike weapons was shut
off but by this time his hands had
been securely tied behind his back
two of the priests jerked him to his
feet and prodded him into move-
ment

  their way led to the prison quar-
ters and graham soon found him-


astounding stories

self in his own cell-alone he did
not see where they had taken nys-
trum he heard some shouting and
shuffling in the gallery below and
the clang of barred doors presum-
ably nystrum and the others were
being locked in their cells as was he

  a lot of use his break for liberty
had been he saw now that he had
only succeeded in making a fool of
himself and fools of the rest of
them once more he had allowed
his hot-headedness to overcome his
better judgment now under suspi-
cion he would be watched more
closely than before perhaps even
he would be among the next to be
chosen to go out

 he puzzled anew regarding the
situation from what he had seen
in the field back there it was obvi-
ous that the relations between the
priests and their subjects were
highly strained it was clear that
the kafejans were demanding the
lives of the captives and that the
priests were preserving those lives
temporarily at least and for what
purpose graham could not believe
that the purpose was a humanitarian
one

  trying to reason it out he mar-
shaled such facts as he knew or
could construct from observation
apparently the kafejans had first
captured surface people ten years or
more ago the first ones they took
had evidently been english or
american and the priests as well as
most of the guards and a few of
the commoners had learned the lan-
guage the hope of all kafeja was
that their people might some day
return to the surface world from
which they had originally been ban-
ished their religion their legends
were based on this hope

  the priests had constructed the
great sphere and commenced their
kidnaping operations on a large

scale the legend was to the effect
that a captive must be had for each
inhabitant of kafeja but that was
next to impossible-the northern
air lanes would not be used now
since the recent disasters the
priests must know that besides
the prison quarters were not of suf-
ficient size to house more than
twelve or fifteen hundred

  that was it graham rose from
his cot when the idea struck him

  nystrum had sensed something
of this the priests were figuring
on leaving kafeja without their sub-
jects a man for a priest there
were twelve hundred of them in all
none for the ordinary kafejans
and the commoners were getting
wise that was the cause of the
growing unrest

  but why the man-for-a-man busi-
ness it didnt make sense surely
if the priests wanted to escape to
the surface they would be able to
do so and without making any pre-
tense at fulfilling the provisions of
the ancient and ridiculous legend
unless as nystrum had suggested
there was something lacking in

them-

  a form darkened the barred door
it was igor

  you do bad the kafejan whis-
pered you do much bad grayum
for be leader of rest you be call
by ithen him much bad

  graham chuckled he had for-
gotten about igor and here was an
ally who might well be of some help
what will he do igor he asked

 not know maybe kill but
igor try stop

  here indeed was gratitude and
from one who should by the word
of the legend be an implacable en-
emy graham asked softly why
are we prisoners here igor and
what are they doing with those they
take away you tell me
telegraph plateau



  the kafejan looked both ways
along the gallery before replying
feelingly priests fool us grayum
legend say you people come as of-
fering to gods not so priests
bring not enough they not send
one to altar not know what they
do to those take away but not do
what legend say that sure

  theres trouble among your peo-
ple

  much trouble more as you
think make plenty fight soon

  what do you mean here

  the kafejan started guiltily
make quiet now he husked
come other guards

  he moved from view and gra-
ham was alone again

  but things were happening on
the main floor of the cell room he
heard loud voices and the tramping
of many feet looking through the
bars of his door he could see a cor-
ner of the room and he noted with
amazement that the prisoners were
being returned from their labors in
large numbers although it was yet
early in the waking period

  what this portended he could not
imagine

  igor returned then in high ex-
citement with him was another
guard and there seemed to be an
understanding between the two a
key rattled in the lock and the
barred door swung open

  must take to ithen said igor
you come grayum and not be
alarm much different now as be-
fore

  the guards hurried him to the
main floor of the cell room where
the prisoners were being checked
in and from there to the assembly
hall graham could get no further
information from igor on the way

  on the platform of the assembly
room sat ithen with thirty or more
of his priests and other priests

lined the walls of the great hall
graham had not seen so many of
them together before he judged
their number to be at least five hun-
dred they outnumbered the guards
many times and flame pistols were
in evidence

  the prisoners were coming in rap-
idly and soon the room was filled
graham saw perry and called out
to him

  silence thundered ithen

  but perry had seen the tall radio
man and was worming his way to
where he stood with his two guards

  believe it or not the pilot
panted ive found out plenty this
morning tell you about it later
he nodded toward the guards

  no time later said igor tell
grayum now guards no hear
the second guard nodded ap-
proval of his words

  boy you did make a friend
perry enthused and youll need
him youll see all hell is popping
in kafeja

  you should tell me returned
graham guess i made some of it
myself but what did you learn
perry lowered his voice i know
the way to the sphere and how to
operate it ive been on board the
-a- and brought these along from
our stores

  he had thrust a number of hard
cylindrical objects into grahams
hand magnesium flares was
perry out of his head

  put them in your pocket con-
tinued the pilot its their sight-
the orange illumination white
light blinds them dont you get
it

  graham did get it those fish eyes
of the kafejans were capable only
of seeing reds and yellows and or-
anges the full spectrum was to
tiem a blinding glare that caused
their pupils to contract shut or that


astounding stories

paralyzed their optic nerves prob-
ably they had come to this state
through the necessity of many gen-
erations of their ancestors living in
entirely darkened caverns or in
those illuminated only by subter-
ranean lava flows where the light
would be distinctly red later
when they had progressed scientifi-
cally they had been forced to the
artificial light they now used

  kafejans were blind in white
light graham fingered the flares
lovingly he knew that the pulling
out of their lighting fuses would
ignite them instantly when neces-
sary

  perry youre a darb he gloated

  another thing said the pilot
is this business of the legend the
priests are not sticking to their
promises at all theyre planning on
getting out of kafeja and leaving
the others in the lurch

 i know-

  yes but you dont know why
theyre expecting an upheaval of
the ocean bed which will destroy
kafeja and theyve figured out the
time it is to occur they cant wait
they must get away within the next
forty days-so they think

 what do you mean-so they
think

  theyve figured wrong graham
i checked their calculations and
found an error clever as they are
this big earthquake is due any day
now

  graham stared so what

  well get out all of us to-day
whats more

  ithen was shouting for order and
igor warned them into silence the
gaze of the big kafejan guard was
eloquent he had overheard and
understood

 the high priest was reading
names from a scroll dugan wells
nystrum fred collins g c col-

lins graham many others as
the names were called those an-
swering to them were led to the
platform

  graham went up with igor cling-
ing to his arm

 two young girls were in the
group called and they came sob-
bing ithen examined them first
peering intently into their faces
and then ordering them away gra-
ham protested angrily but igoi
held him fast

  not now begged the kafejan
later

  joey dugan was next and graham
saw that the lad could scarcely
stand evidently he had been
beaten

  ithen peered into his face as he
had done with the others dugan
swayed where he stood and clutched
at his guard for support the
guard struck him brutally across the
mouth

  this was too much for graham
he wrenched free of igor and was
upon dugans assailant in a single
bound there was a quick roaring
flame and the hot breath of it singed
grahams hair he heard a moan
and the fall of a body

  igor had flung himself before
ithens pistol to protect the man
who had saved his life and now lay
a smoldering charred heap at the
high priests feet grahams hands
fell to his side and he was suddenly
sick inside

  ithen raised the pistol again but
lowered it immediately

  no he said grimly on second
thought i shall wait for your rash-
ness you are to be reserved for a
very special purpose you may
stand to one side until i have fin-
ished with these others

  dully graham watched as num-
bers of the captives were examined
and taken away to that fate which
telegraph plateau



was so mysteriously veiled he
could see perry down below and
perry was motioning to him en-
joining patience

  when the first group had been
led away there came an interrup-
tion a delegation of kafejans was
demanding audience with the high
priest

  ithen scowled darkly but after
a conference with his advisers
waved his hand to signify that the
delegation might approach

  the leader of the delegation was
a huge fellow and he came boldly
to face the high priest his words
were in his own tongue but there
was no mistaking their earnestness
or purport he spoke heatedly and
his gestures included the entire as-
semblage of prisoners graham did
not need to be told that he was de-
manding the sacrifice called for in
the legend charging that the priests
had broken faith

  ithen rose quaking with rage and
hot words of refusal came from his
thin lips the leader of the delega-
tion answered with equal heat and
then came the blast of flame from
ithens pistol his accuser was a
cindery mass blackened beyond all
recognition as a kafejan

  instantly pandemonium reigned
in the assembly hall the guards
were leaving their posts and the
priests along the walls came to life
it was apparent that ithen had an-
ticipated something like this and
had taken pains to be prepared

  one group of priests set out to
battle the guards and another group
commenced herding the captives to-
gether to keep them out of the fight-
ing queer how anxious they were
to keep the prisoners from harm
thought graham once more

  but ithen had reckoned without
the courage and determination of
his people they came streaming

into the hall in ever-increasing num-
bers and as soon as one fell before
the withering flame another was in
his place the guards working
with their friends outside had
opened the great doors of the prison
quarters and thousands were com-
ing for the final accounting with
the priests

  perry leaped to the platform
nows our chance he shouted
a flare and well get out while the
getting out is good

  seeing him ithen swung up his
pistol but graham was too quick
for him he knocked aside the hand
which held the flame spouter and
went after ithen with joy in his
heart his long arms worked like
piston rods and the high priest fell
back under the rain of blows his
pistol knocked half across the plat-
form

  but ithen was no mean antago-
nist while he knew nothing of the
art of boxing there was tremendous
strength in his arms and he closed
with the lanky american bear-fash-
ion feeling the pressure of those
encircling arms graham knew he
would have to resort to a trick if he
was to best his gorilla-chested an-
tagonist he yielded suddenly as if
giving way and this threw the other
off balance ithens viselike hold
loosed and graham had him where
he wanted him

  a headlock and a quick twist the
cracking of bones and ithen went
limp there would be no more dev-
ilment from him

  only then did graham notice that
the hall was strangely quiet and
that it was lighted brilliantly blue-
white perry had set off one of the
magnesium flares kafejans were
groping their way aimlessly and
captives were staring open-mouthed
at the platform

  this way perry was screech-


astounding stories

ing follow us and well all see
our homes once more

  a great shout came up from the
prisoners and they surged forward

  and then joey dugan came stum-
bling from a side entrance he was
ghastly white in the light of the
flare but two spots of angry color
flamed in his cheeks he almost fell
into grahams arms

  god he gasped n god
graham its our eyes they took
me to a hospital where they were
settin to take out our eyes and graft
them into the heads o these damned
priests the kafejans raided the
hospital and i got away else theyd
have had mine

  the lad collapsed then and gra-
ham had to carry him as he followed
perry from the hall

vii

 a broad passage that
opened into the solid rock provided
a means of speedy escape for the
fugitives they streamed in after
perry and graham hundreds of
them and officers of the stockholm
and icelandia quickly organized into
an orderly retreat what had started
as a rout ahead of them the pas-
sage was deserted

  probably wont be many kafe-
jans to run into perry said most
all of thjfcm are behind us but that
flare wont last forever graham
better drop back and set off another
to keep them from following
dugan had fainted on grahams
shoulder he shifted the slight
form and looked back at those fol-
lowing he saw nystrum shoving
his way to the front he too had
escaped the priestss surgeons

  here take him said graham
passing the lad to nystrums ready
arms hes out poor kid and i
have to be rear guard for a while

  drawing back against the wall of
the passage he stood waiting as the
fugitives swept past at a dog trot
there were more men than women
he observed but most of the women
were quite young he remembered
then that the icelandia had carried
a party of college girls who were
starting a tour of the world he
thought grimly of what might have
happened to them-what still might
happen if anything went wrong
with their plans a few children
were here too some in the arms of
their parents others running along
on skipping feet all of them old
and young alike were excited and in
rising spirits-hopeful for the first
time since their incarceration

  the two girls ithen had sent from
the platform went past arm in arm
laughing and crying in turn

  then the last of them had gone
by and graham planted one of his
flares in the floor of the passage and
drew the fuse the usual orange
illumination gave way to the vivid
blue-white of burning magnesium
he ran on after the others

  the floor of the passage rose
sharply and it soon widened out into
a great room with arched roof high
above there was the sound of a
conflict ahead and perrys voice
rising above the din graham set
off a second flare by the time he
reached the scene of trouble he
found it was over perry and a
number of fugitives had subdued the
four guards they found in the place
so far the way was clear

  perry shouted to his followers
the sphere is in the adjoining
chamber and the stockholm is still
inside it theyve made away with
the icelandia and some of the
smaller ships but the stockholm
will hold you all my idea is that
such of her officers as are left man
her and make her ready to take to
telegraph plateau



the air as soon as i bring the sphere
to the surface shell carry you
safely home

  shouts of approval drowned out
his final words well follow in
the -a- he said in an aside to
graham

  no kafejans were in the cavern
of the huge sphere and the fugitives
trooped in through the great doors
which were open in the lower sec-
tion of the big vessels hull there
was only the one entrance to the
inclosing cavern and perry lighted
one of his flares in it before proceed-
ing to the near-by controls of the
gravity machinery they were safe
from pursuit until that flare had
burned itself out

  it was almost too easy-getting
away like this remarked graham

  perry answered soberly were
not out yet

  looking up at the curved hull of
the enormous sphere graham was
awed at thought of the knowledge
and skill that had gone into its con-
struction at the thought that this
huge bulk could be lifted from the
depths by a nullification or actual
reversal of the force of gravity it
was almost unbelievable

  most of the fugitives had entered
the sphere and he was left alone
with perry in the midst of a maze
of machinery that suddenly whirred
into life an alarming idea struck
him

 suppose they shut down the
power plant below he said

  let em returned perry this
gravity machine is self-excited
makes its own power they cant
stop us now

  graham looked up into the vast
reaches above the sphere and saw a
great circular door opening up there
beyond it was blackness

  the waterspout has started
breathed perry well rise up

through the opening it leaves be-
hind come along now

  everythings ready

  sure

  perry started for a small door at
the lowest point of the spheres hull
the large double doors through
which the fugitives had entered
were already closed

  knowing perry too well to ques-
tion him further at this time gra-
ham followed they entered a con-
trol room that was directly at the
bottom of the huge vessel perry
closed the door

  now said the pilot snapping on
an orange light youll see how
much i learned about this thing in
no time at all

  there was the throb of machinery
above them as he moved a lever a
rising of the sphere with swift ac-
celeration as he moved another
then they were shooting up toward
the surface

 a wall of water was all around
them held back by the mysterious
gravity energy of the priests of
kafeja

  perry said as if talking to him-
self  that last flare should hold out
until were in the open air then
let em shut off the energy down
there

  will the sphere support itself
asked graham

  yes once its above the water
the energy from below acts only
upon the water itself boring the
opening through which we are ris-
ing but the spheres own genera-
tors provide the force which actu-
ally lifts us you see it would be
impossible to construct a vessel as
large as this which would withstand
the pressure of the depths hence
the flinging upward of the water to
provide a passage thats pressure-
less if that passage should close in
on us now-good-by


astounding stories

  graham looked down through the
control-room windows through that
ever-lengthening water-walled tube
to the dwindling light circle that
marked the open door to kafeja no
one was there to close that door

  he saw that the water around
them was turning blue the light
of the sun was reaching down to
them now

  nystrum came into the control
room announcing that dugan had
recovered and was quartered in the
best stateroom of the stockholm
and everything is set for their
take-off he concluded im com-
ing with you two on the -a--to
replace dugan

  perry nodded approval

  the water around them was light-
ening rapidly in color graham saw
a swift-moving form that turned
over and revealed flashing rows of
teeth only a few feet from the wall
of the water tube-a shark they
were nearing the surface

  then came a tremendous upheaval
the sphere rocked mightily the
circle of light below was snuffed out
instantly and the waters of the
ocean closed in around them

  the earthquake choked perry

  a window of the control room
crashed in under the pressure and
they were flung back by the deluge
that came pouring in

  tossed about like corks they rode
out of the control room on the surg-
ing flood battling desperately in
the darkness they reached the cir-
cular stair which led to the reaches
above the stair careened and
swayed beneath their feet making
progress upward most difficult

  were afloat perry exulted
the sphere will sink of course-
but if only we have time to get our
own ships out were all safe

  graham could only gasp cripes
as he toiled upward

  when at length they reached the
deck on which the stockholm and
the -a- were berthed they saw
daylight nystrum greeted it with
a shout graham with a chuckle of
satisfaction

  the great doors had been opened
and men were running back from
them to the air liner outside was
the sea and the sunshine-safety

  it would be tricky work launching
the stockholm into the air from this
heaving deck perry went up under
her control cabin and argued himself
hoarse advising the impatient cap-
tain to wait until the sphere had set-
tled deeper into the water and thus
stabilized

  then he made for the -a- with
graham and nystrum

  the wait was nerve-racking the
sphere sank slowly but as it settled
the rolling became less noticeable
when the waves were lapping at the
landing deck the stockholm roared
out through the great doors and van-
ished from sight and the -a-
leaped out after her

  below them the sea seemed to
bulge upward as they gained alti-
tude the stockholm was streaking
off rapidly to the southwest but
perry zooming up to two thousand
feet circled the spot where the big
sphere was tossing about suddenly
the heaving waters burst into spray
and the sphere was spewed out
above a boiling whirlpool only to
sink back and go down as if snatched
by the hand of neptune a sullen
roar came up from the depths

  and that said perry solemnly
is the end of kafeja

  he headed the ship for harbor
grace without further ado nys-
trum went up to the motor runway
graham to the radio cabin

  with headphones clamped to his
ears it did not take graham long to
find out that the stockholms oper-
telegraph plateau



ator had beat him to it in reporting
the news to harbor grace already
the air was full of it and praises of
the -a- and her crew were not
lacking grunting his disgust gra-
ham switched off his receiver and
returned to the pilots cabin where
he seated himself beside perry

  after a time when the little am-
phibian was speeding swiftly home-
ward at five thousand feet he started
asking questions

 perry he began doubtingly
you dont believe those priests were
actually transplanting eyes do
you

 i know they were they had
about fifty of their own kind fixed
up that way already with eyes from
our sort eyes that could see in
white blue green or purple light
as their own eyes could not

 but-to do a thing like that
none of our own surgeons would be
able to

  you forget said perry that
they had worked on the problem for
generations and students of
science who could devise forces such
as those which kept our engines
running without ignition and those
which drew n a a t vessels into
their sphere willy-nilly should be
equal to an accomplishment of sur-
gery like that

  the devils

 graham thought some more
they were planning to get just
enough for themselves and leave the
common trash behind in kafeja he
ruminated and to establish them-
selves in england or america i
cant see why they couldnt have
worn orange glasses to shut out the
end of the spectrum that would
blind them why not

  theyd have to use closely fit-
ting goggles to exclude any and all
rays not suited to their vision such
goggles would be uncomfortable

and besides would mark them as
different from our kind-make them
most conspicuous the priests of
kafeja were proud

  for comfort and pride theyd do
-what they were doing graham
shuddered it was inconceivable
that these things had been that at
least fifty of his fellow men had suf-
fered and finally died in kafeja

  right was perrys solemn reply
and we were between the devil and
the deep blue sea down there with
the kafejans wanting our lives and
their priests our eyes if it hadnt
have been for the under dogs find-
ing out about the priests double
dealing just when they did wed not
have escaped

  it was typical of perry that he
took no credit himself

  more silence broken only by the
smooth pur of the motors

 then graham asked his final
question

  how in time did you ever learn
all those things about the grav-
ity energy the orange light and the
effect of white light on a kafejans
eyes-how to get to the sphere and
to operate it

 perrys thoughts were on other
matters knowing well these fits
of abstraction graham waited pa-
tiently until he replied

  there was a machine in the lab-
oratory one that was capable of
dragging a mans secrets from him
a thing they were experimenting
with a machine that searched a
human brain for its inmost knowl-
edge and translated its very thoughts
into intelligible impulses a mind-
reading mechanism if you please
they had me doing their dirty work
in the laboratory theyd never have
told me a thing but i grabbed off
one of the priests and got him into
the cage of this machine when none
of the others was looking i learned


astounding stories

about kafeja from him then i
gagged him and trussed him up and
tossed him in a closet

  you son of a gun said graham
admiringly

  perrys gaze was dreamy whats
more im going to build one of
those machines and a gravity ap-
paratus he concluded as soon as
i get home

  graham felt like talking but knew
it was no use now the pilot had
gone into one of his trances he was
inventing something again and
nothing could interrupt his train of
thought sauntering into the radio
cabin the operator switched on his
transmitter if he could get in a
word edgewise with that guy on the
stockholm hed ask after dugan

strange case

       during the world war a german soldier was wounded in the
   head through the application of good surgery his life was saved
   but pressure on that part of the brain controlling sleep paralyzed
   its normal functions

        since that time the man has not slept he works in the day-
    time at night he patronizes the night clubs of his city as a
    haven from the loneliness of deserted streets at those rare in-
    tervals when he feels tired he rests-wide awake and altogether
    conscious he is in good physical condition aside from his
    sleeplessness he is normal scientists of all countries have puzzled
    over his case

       his only cause of complaint is the cost of his living to
   spend every night in a night club is expensive it takes all he can
   earn in the daytime to pay for the occupation of his long lonely
   nights
