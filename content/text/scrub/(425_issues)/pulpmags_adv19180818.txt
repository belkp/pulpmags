chapter i

may he who coldly scoffs at pangs of love
be straight enamored of yon lark above

may he despairing see her gaily rise

to mock his hopeless passion from the skies

-sidi hammo

 aflrom the cool of the old-fash-
	ioned arch of wine office court

i fepjg a tall young man plunged into

	the stream swirling down fleet

street at the law courts he glanced up
at the clock and came to an irresolute halt
by the curbstone as he stared idly a girl
popped out from behind a taxicab and pro-
ceeded to cross the road

  she was of medium height dark as a
spaniard and walked with the self-reliant
swing of the american woman a cream
soft hat devoid of any decoration save a
dark tassel and her loose holland costume
gave her a cool capable appearance she
saw him when hafi-way across the road
acknowledged his salute and changed her
course as a taxi came whirring up behind
her

  he started forward in alarm as the ma-
chine bore down upon her hooting dis-
mally she glanced over her shoulder as if

measuring the distance and increased her
pace by a fraction the cab shot by her
with scarcely a foot to spare he had
stepped back on to the pavement hurriedly
sheepishly she looked up as she held out
her hand her large eyes observing him
amusedly and remarked-

 well whats the news

 oh nothing certain

 well come and have tea with me
 she moved on leaving him to overtake her
 in a stride

 yes ill take you to tea miriam

 she glanced at him

 but nobody asked you sir she said 
 well of course it comes to the same
 thing he retorted

 nothing of the sort i asked you to tea
 with me dont start that idiotic argu-
 ment all over again

 but-but-its-ive told you i cant

 let a girl pay-

 rubbish youre too english youd
 better tea by yourself he hesitated
 frowning

 she looked up at him with a laugh then
 her lips tightened

 it isnt the fact of the things its the
 principle

adventure

 yes i know he said as they turned
 toward a tea-room in the cool quietude of
 cliffords inn youve explained that

 fact most lucidly but all the same-

 you think that because youre a man
 she caught him up that its an insult to
 your dignity rubbish

 as a matter of fact she began again as
 soon as they were seated and had ordered
 tea you have an idea that it is symbolical
 of the rights of women

 oh lord he groaned

 she laughed

 women who earn their own living have
 a perfect right to equality with men there
 are men who are just as incapable just as
 inefficient as any woman but there are
 women-i lordly creature tapping him
 on the shin with a dainty foot i am quite
 as capable of earning my living as you-
 salt of the earth

 he smiled indulgently

 yes in some cases but even then it
 never is the same work as a man does
 poof and why not

 well as dressmakers milliners needle-
 workers and-and all that sort of thing

and even then men-

 he paused doubtfully gazing at her
 twitching lips

 sugar lordly creature

 dont be a fool miriam he said
 sourly a womans place is behind the
 shelter of man he works fights conquers
 to her gain

 are you fighting and conquering for a
 womans gain

 just like a woman he retorted
 mere sentimentality

 exactly what is sentimentality

 love-and all that

 dear me really

 their glances met he laughed with the
 satisfaction of one parrying a dangerous
 thrust from the enemy

 sentimental bosh of the worst descrip-
 tion plato-

 plato is dead live and see for your-
 self youll find out one day

 i he laughed derisively my dear
 miriam one of the great points that i
 value is that we can be pals that you never
 expect me-like every other girl-to make
 love to you

 her eyes twinkled she opened her lips to
 say something changed her mind and said-
 have some more tea alan

  no thanks he said looking at his
watch i must run up to the office if
theres any fresh development in the
moroccan imbroglio i may have to get
away immediately by the way miriam
if i should have to leave in a hurry i shant
have time to run home so you might make
a point of seeing the mater and-explaining
things shes always absurdly anxious

imagines things-

  and doesnt understand mens affairs
eh but supposing i cant get away
why not youve only the usual shop
to attend to

  but i might go abroad too

  he laughed indulgently

  my dear child youre a brilliant journal-
ist-for a woman

  thank you she said with a short laugh
  but-oh women are very well within

limits but-

  what limits pray

  well you know what your work is-at
races balls crushes and all that sort of thing

-social work but-

  well but what go on

  hang it miriam you cant expect to do
a mans work

  really why not

  well how on earth could you tackle my
job fancy a woman as a war correspond-
ent why obviously its impossible
how why

  oh dont be absurd child how could
a woman travel in morocco alone get
through the tribes or into some blockaded
town for instance

  well you havent explained

  he jerked out his cigaret-case irritably
  well

  oh i cant be bothered to explain the
obvious

       her eyes glinted angrily for a
moment then she sat back in the
chair to watch him light his cigaret
she observed the broad shoulders and huge
limbs the flaxen hair above his long clean-
shaven face he was not bad-looking
really she decided the high forehead
straight nose and prominent jaw suggested
a horses head-a nice horse that she
wanted to pat she smiled at the idea and
thought it a pity that his eyes were a trifle
small as he stared rather sulkily at his
boots a young giant but lacking    she
pulled herself up short and said slowly-
the double scoop



  alan

  yes

  do you know that you badly need a
hiding

  he smiled complacently palpably re-
joicing in his physique

  whos going to give it to me he de-
manded stretching his arms

  im going to no not physically you
glorious she had nearly said you ani-
mal im going to give you a good lesson
he laughed and stood up

  come along my child he said moving
toward the pay desk

  no you dont cried miriam and
slipped in front of him

  miriam dont be-

  you dare she flashed upon him he
turned away with an impatient sigh to wait
while she received change

  i do feel a fool he confided to a print
on the wall

  and you are said miriam as she
joined him come along

  they walked up fleet street together
she waited whilst he went into his office
he was away longer than miriam expected
and she began to grow impatient at last
he reappeared smiling restrainedly
whenre you going she asked
tomorrow night - overland to gib
just seen the chief he said endeavoring to
curb his school-boy excitement

  and then

  on to fez to interview the sultan
latest news is that general moinier is
leaving from rabat at the request of the
sultan to relieve fez its what i told you
would happen months ago

  dyou think fez will fall

  no the frenchll get there all right-
unless some one cuts hafids throat then
the germans will chip in then therell be
a lovely row he declared enthusiastically

  the germans said miriam thought-
fully i hadnt thought of that i must
read up the subject

do said alan then youll be able to
follow my stuff better ill write you too
thanks said miriam and laughed
whatre you laughing at he de-
manded

  nothing

  hm come and lunch with me to-
morrow shall be leaving by the evening
boat-train and i say dont forget the
mater will you

  if i have time

  course youll have time

  going on the bust this evening i sup-
pose she inquired looking him full in the
eyes

  promised to dine some of the boys he
said grinning

  hm-men well good-by alan-and
good luck remember what i told you
what you told me

  yes about a good hiding she said
smiling

  oh said he as one dismissing a trivial
question my dear girl-but ill see you

tomorrow so-

  no you wont i shall be busy

 busy why

  yes never mind youll know sometime
good-by-and dont be surprised when we
meet again

  oh thatll be six months or more-snow
and mistletoe at home eh good-by
good-by alan

  he raised his hat and strode way his chin
a trifle higher shoulders a little farther back
miriam watched him for a moment with an
enigmatic smile and turning dived into the
traffic making straight to the library of her
paper

  she nodded to one of the girls in charge
morocco please - revolution 
said miriam curtly

  the girl went to one of the many lines of
pigeonholes containing hundreds of dock-
eted envelopes and selected a large fat one
with which miriam retired to an adjacent
desk sat down and with notebook and pen-
cil proceeded to wade through a vast mass
of newspaper cuttings on morocco

  it was after nine oclock by the time that
miriam left the library to snatch a hurried
dinner and finish some articles for the third
and fourth editions

  contrary to her usual custom she ar-
rived in fleet street in the morning and
requested a personal interview with her
editor after the conference at last she was
ushered into the great mans sanctum
langley was a notoriously difficult man to
handle she exercised great tact in broach-
ing the proposition

  at first he would not hear of it although
he approved of the idea

  no no its quite impossible quite
impossible miss vickers im sorry

  why is it impossible because im a
woman


adventure

well yes obviously

 then youre going to send a man
 yes

 and steal my idea-agadir

 really miss vickers you place me in a
 very awkward position

 it isnt awkward at all mr langley
 let me go

 but youd never get in be murdered
 held for ransom or carried off into the-er-
 interior you dont understand what might
 happen

 oh yes i do quite and take the
 risk come mr langley dont be so hide-
 bound by convention women can do fine
 things sometimes think im pleading for
 my sex as well as myself

 but you ought not to miss vickers
 sex ought not to enter into business
 exactly cried miriam triumphantly
 now you cant refuse

 langley smiled grimly

 expediency my dear miss vickers i
 darent take the risk of answering to my
 people if anything happened-to a woman
 think what the public would say

 easily got over ill use a male nom
 de guerre thats a sacrifice mr lang-
 ley

he shook his head and frowned
slightly

 i can not do it miss vickers he an-
 nounced in a tone of finality im very
 pressed for time

 you must let me go mr langley
 now everything is a matter of price ill go
 for my expenses only

 no the odium-the responsibility would
 be just the same

 wait ill go in my own name at my own
 expense you pay for stuff published-
 usual foreign rates you cant afford to
 refuse that

 hm langley paused pursing his
 hard clean-shaven lips

 use a male nom de guerre and its a
 bargain

 youre close mr langley but women
 and beggars cant be choosers i suppose i
 agree

chapter ii

 be wise young jackal open not by day

 await the somber safer face of night

 be sure that all you meet upon the way

 are greyhounds trained to run you down at sight

                         -sidi ilammo

come three weeks later miriam rose
 from breakfast on board the r m s
agadir to see the streak of white foam of
the sandy coast-line run out in a gossamer
thread into the horizon where about a
point on the port bow appeared the daz-
zling white tops of minarets floating in the
refraction of the suns glare

  steadily the ship throbbed her way
through the empty blue seas lessening the
mirage effect of the distant city until the
white houses grew above the black rocks
and the funnels and masts of a french
cruiser at anchor materialized against the
dark of the land beyond

  lunch was just ending as they steamed
through the deep-water passage and swung
to anchor alongside the cruiser from the
deck of the steamer the town a mass of
white-topped houses snuggling within the
encircling ramparts nestled half upon the
sandy shore and half upon the greeny-black
rocks where the old arched water-gate
stood at the brink of the water in dignified
challenge

  to the right of the town was a fair
stretch of hard sand sweeping up into the
dunes which ran on to the southwest into
the foothills of the atlas mountains be-
hind the ship stretched a linked arm of
small islets a natural breakwater against
the atlantic seas in the blue of the sea
and sky the moorish town scintillated and
gleamed like a rare jewel set in the gold of
the sand justifying the native name es-
sueira the picture

  miriam was more than a little excited at
having arrived at the beginning of the
great adventure which would prove her
theory right or wrong a theory evolved
from a careful study of the map that the
objective of the germans in the first move
of the international game of chess for the
possession of morocco would be agadir the
finest seaport on the atlantic coast and the
key to the great caravan route from the
south closed to trade for fifty years by
treaty

  her plans for the moment were chaotic
and a little fluttered by the fear that alan
or some other male correspondent would
have happened upon the same idea an-
other british steamer was not expected
until the next week but she had heard
that an italian french or german boat
might turn up any day all things being
erratic and unforeseen in morocco hence
the double scoop



her rather flurried determination to make
a start at once

  within an hour miriam had been bap-
tized in the clinging odor and lazy hum of
the orient once more at the hotel she
had engaged a sharp-faced young guide
who spoke a broken english feeling that
she could conduct inquiries better herself
than trust to distortive interpretation she
demanded to be taken to the jewish quarter
for although she had no arabic she had a
sound knowledge of spanish-archaic span-
ish studied as a hobby-which most of the
jews of the moghreb spoke in the tongue
of old castile a relic of their forefathers in
the peninsula

  she had not as yet formulated any defi-
nite plan by which she might gain access
to agadir the idea of engaging servants
and boldly setting out from mogador was
she saw quite impracticable for the one
reason that the american consul would
never permit her to leave no it must be
by strategy the method she intended to
investigate was an attempt to approach by
water failing that she left the fates to
decide with the mental reservation that
go she would-somehow

  tcha hondi expostulated ahmed in
disgust

  miriam insisted so with a muttered
curse calling the wrath of allah upon jews
and other infidels ahmed led the way see-
ing many perquisites falling into other
pockets than his own

  at the end of the narrow street she came
upon the ship-party of tourists suburban
dames sprawling uncomfortably on the
backs of donkeys with indignant noses and
perpetual expressions of nervousness at the
unstable nature of their straw saddles at
which they clawed with frantic fingers
others struggled vainly to appear at home
perched upon the red-flanneled cumbrous
saddles of their mules all in too desperate
an alarm to do other than appreciate the
variety and pungency of the street smells

  now miriam had omitted to make the
orthodox farewells in sheer dread of the
storm of inquisitive questions which would
surely accompany the amenities

  why theres miss vickers cried the
foremost dame and immediately fell off
her donkey

  during the ensuing hubbub of shrill
laughs cries of distress and guttural ob-
jurgations of the donkey-boys miriam

made her escape by turning down the first
handy turning which happened to be a
narrow dark alley scarce six feet wide over
which the houses met hurrying through
this tunnel wondering whether ahmed
would have the sense to follow her she
came out into a small open space thronged
with white-robed moors amid the dust and
filth of horses camels mules and donkeys
grunting and heehawing

  a group of mountaineers wild elf-locked
berbers with camel-hair turbans turned to
stare at her their hawk-noses and fierce
eyes questioning covetous miriam turned
aside to avoid them and met the dark
somber eyes of a moor at her elbow that
look inscrutable yet suggestive of unthink-
able vices sent a thrill of apprehension
through her she knew well the insolent
expression of certain types of european
men but they seemed artificial in com-
parison to the calm assurance and depth
of wickedness in those moorish eyes

she turned away to look up the
passage for the first time she felt
a misgiving at the prospect of
traveling alone in this barbarous country
there was no sign of ahmed but out of the
gloom of the tunnel appeared a tall gray-
bearded figure clad in a black pill-box cap
and black soutane a veritable patriarch
stepping out of a biblical picture

  as she stood irresolute not daring to turn
for fear of those hideous glances he came
toward her slowly he glanced at her curi-
ously and at the motley crowd beyond
evidently her distress was written upon her
face for he paused in front of her as if de-
siring to speak but embarrassed for need
of the medium of speech she saw a kindly
dignity seasoned with a touch of cunning
at the back of those bright black eyes

  where does this road lead to she in-
quired in spanish

  the old jew showed no surprise save by
the lighting up of his eyes as with a ges-
ture of greeting full of exquisite grace he
saluted her and said

  this is a fondak caravansary the
dona has lost her road

  no senor replied miriam i sought
to take a short-cut i thank you i wall go
back

  if the dona will permit said the
patriarch i will conduct her she has
lost her guide


adventure

  yes ahmed is a fool he-

  at that moment a scrawny creature clad
in rags with a brown-seamed face like a
gargoyle brushed roughly past her and spat
fiercely between them rasping out a string
of curses

  the beast exclaimed miriam glaring
after him angrily

  but the jew apparently had neither
heard nor seen the insult for he was saying
imperturbably-

  if the dona will follow me

  his voice was almost drowned by the
voluble curses of his aggressor the loud
laughter of the moors and the muleteers in
the vicinity miriams anger merged into a
wave of admiration for the calm dignity of
the patriarchal jew as she turned to fol-
low him he halted with his back to the
fanatic who was still spewing curses shel-
tering her and with a courtly gesture bade
her go on in front the action and the
grace impressed the girl no one in this
generation she thought could have sur-
vived the incident with the same inimitable
dignity it was medieval

  and the street thronged with donkeys
mules and horses-the jarring note in the
shape of the party of tourists had disap-
peared-the glimpse of the embattled ram-
parts with the narrow slits in the bastions
fashioned for arrows made her forget her
own incongruous clothes a french naval
officer smartly uniformed and dapper ma-
king his way through the crowd seemed like
some strange being from another century
as she paused for a moment to allow the
jew to overtake her she felt a sensation of
giddiness as her mind escaped the bonds of
suggestion and readjusted itself to reality

  at a little distance along her guide turned
off down a cobbled lane to the left and pres-
ently halted at a narrow blue door she
was ushered into an open courtyard paved
with blue and white tiles the whitewashed
pillars and the mattresses ranged beside
the walls in a large room opposite were
scrupulously clean the yellow sun threw
the arched veranda into violet shade cool
and restful

  the old man clapped his hands and in
response a young girl with prominent dark
eyes and rosy cheeks appeared she was
dressed in a dark-blue caftan twisted
round her black hair was a brilliantly yel-
low kerchief and in her small ears large gold
earrings he said something in hebrew

whereat she laughed merrily and moved
away her slippers shuffling over the tiles to
reappear with another woman similarly
clad but elderly and stout

  miriam was soon seated uncomfortably
enough in european costume upon the
edge of one of the mattresses on the floor
sweet coffee was brought the old man
sat quietly in one corner his wife and
daughter near to miriam talking politely in
spanish their eyes shyly inquisitive
questioned every article of her attire

  gradually miriam began to lose her sense
of strangeness and led the talk upon the
ways and customs of the country to the
trend of opinion concerning the present sul-
tan and the general situation gaining copy
as a good journalist should when at
length miriam intimated that she would
like to leave they insisted that she must
break bread with them miriam felt a
queer sense of shame in pretending to pro-
test that she must go whilst she really
wished and intended to stay

  the breaking of bread was a ceremonious
affair of many dishes chiefly cous-cous an
arab dish of semolina but made in the jew-
ish style with raisins although she soon
felt very much at home there was an ever-
recurring sense of incongruity the man-
ipulation of her parisian-shod feet troubled
her her sun-hat became an abomination
and her comparatively loose skirt developed
the tentacles of an octopus in cramping her
limbs she longed to throw them away
and envied the cool caftan and bare feet of
the little goggle-eyed jewess boots in-
deed seemed a sacrilege on the smooth tiled
floor

  at last she was driven to discard her hat
and scarcely realizing what she was doing
so fumbled with her hairpins that her long
black tresses rolled down her back to the
admiration of her hostess and daughter

  there seemed an atavistic sense of her
natural environment in the air she was
impelled to confide in the patriarch sitting
there so wise and dignified she felt sure
that they would not betray her for a
moment she conquered the desire and to
compromise began to talk of agadir

  the old man musa ben ibrahim de-
scribed the place to her she was con-
scious of exaltation when he announced
that he had relatives and many business
friends there he held forth long and
earnestly against the tyranny and injustice
the double scoop



of the kaid gilhooli chief of the district
miriam inquired whether it were possible
to approach the town by water saying that
she had a friend who thought of going that
way ben ibrahim wagged a forefinger in
dissent it would be quite impossible to
get a boat of any sort to undertake the trip
from mogador he advised her friend not
to attempt it the land journey was the
usual way but dangerous even for moorish
or jewish merchants miriams heart sank

pp at that moment little zara who
i had taken a great fancy to miriam
and had seated herself as close as
she dared to her could restrain her curi-
osity no longer her black eyes goggling
with excitement she craved permission to
see and handle a string of blue egyptian
beads which miriam wore miriam un-
fastened and handed them to zara who
yelped with delighted admiration flinging a
score of questions then miriam her dis-
appointment dulled for the moment by the
distraction asked to be allowed to see the
girls hair kerchief

  zara laughed delightedly at the compli-
ment as she quickly unwound it miriam
after admiring the texture laughingly put it
over her own head zara quick to grasp an
idea wriggled over and bound it in the jew-
ish fashion over miriams long hair and sat
back with many eh ehs of admiration
pointing a triumphant podgy finger mir-
iam glanced at her host he was staring at
her in amazement

  by abraham he cried look my
woman she is one of us

  miriam flushed and laughed zara with
a little cry sprang up and pattered away she
returned staggering under the weight of a
gilded mirror which her father assisted her
to rest on the floor miriam gave an in-
voluntary cry of astonishment the bright-
yellow kerchief bound about her own raven
hair her own large latin eyes olive-tinted
complexion and red lips formed the picture
of a typical oriental jewess peering
amazedly with heavy gold earrings and
the caftan the resemblance would have been
perfect

  for a moment or two miriam was an-
noyed then she gave a gasp and sat back
abruptly staring at the patriarch in the
corner the solution of the problem of en-
tering agadir had flashed into her mind
in the jewish garb nobody not even a

moor would suspect her american na-
tionality she felt an almost overwhelming
desire to hug the old man to tear off her
boots and european clothes to dance sing
laugh and cry at the same time

  with an effort she controlled herself
smiled and gave back the kerchief to zara
as a preliminary she told little zara to
keep the egyptian necklace to the little
ones wild delight who not to be outdone
in courtesy insisted that miriam should ac-
cept the hair kerchief

  miriam now keen upon business thanked
her absent-mindedly she reflected that
this man had relatives at agadir and busi-
ness dealings he would surely be send-
ing or having a share sooner or later in
some caravan going to agadir she must
persuade him to let her go disguised as a
jewess

  talking and smiling abstractedly she
thought out her plan of action she had
contemplated going as a moorish woman
but as such great difficulties would have to
be overcome for her liberty would be neces-
sarily restricted and she had no liking to
trust herself in the hands of any moor

  a panic seized her that alan or some other
correspondent might arrive at any moment
she must lose no time but strike whilst the
opportunity served after a short pre-
amble to the effect that she was a woman
writer in which she had some difficulty in
convincing them-they seemed to think it a
great joke and laughed discreditingly-she
plunged straight into her proposition

  at first it was received with uplifted
palms of horror it was impossible-if any-
thing happened the american consul would
hold him responsible but when miriam
pointed out that she was prepared to pay
well the refusals became less emphatic and
she hinted that there were sure to be other
jews who would not be so timid after an
excited colloquy with his wife amid much
gesticulation he agreed then came the
crux of the argument-the price for all
his patriarchal bencvolence and hospitality
the mention of douro-long and gesticula-
tory was the bargaining but at length it
was completed

  there was no caravan leaving for two
weeks he protested but in consideration of
certain money one should leave on the mor-
row with miriam in charge of his son and
little zara as her maid

  the sky was a pageant of scarlet and
io

adventure

amber fading to violet over the dense blue
of the sea as miriam returned to the hotel
here she discovered the proprietor in a
state of incoherent excitement imploring
the consul to organize a search-party as
ahmed had returned with the news that
miss vickers had been kidnaped miriam
almost laughed herself into hysterics more
at the thought of her success than at the
corpulent distress of boniface

bismillah heres ink a fair tablet a pen

ill set down the names of your enemies men

                        -sidi uammo

five days later a small caravan wound
through a rugged and rocky defile
the glare of the afternoon sun shone
straight into the eyes of the travelers
in the van riding sideways upon a decrepit
pack-horse was yakub bin musa a young
jew who with his black cropped hair and
small mustache was of a type which save
for the black fez cap and dirty gray soutane
might be seen any day in london or new
york immaculately clad in conventional
garb

  behind straggled a small train of pack-
donkeys in the midst of which were a party
of three men-a boy of fifteen and two
ancients-and two women all were
mounted on donkeys astride or sideways
upon the straw-filled packsaddles as big
as half a sofa for miles they had plodded
along the rugged mountain-side in silence
save for objurgatory oaths on the part of
the men toward the animals who traveled
patiently with the blase air of their kind
the big ears swaying listlessly

  to the south the land fell away in rough
undulations like enormous tumuli to a vast
plain across which meandered a faint broad
track as of an army-the great highway
across the sus from timbuktu and the
soudan scattered at long intervals were
a few mud-walled villages glinting white
in the sunlight and on the horizon the blue
of distant hills behind the ground rose
in jumbles masses of sandy rock and sward
losing itself in the brown and blue of the
heights of the lower atlas mountains bold
and stately

  presently in a twist of a hill path a group
of horsemen appeared three wore the

dignified white robes and hoods of the moor
and were mounted on scarlet saddles the
others in the van were wild-looking arabs
in gray woolen garments black elflocks
peeping out below their camel-hair turbans
long-barreled guns sticking out across their
pommels as they approached riding in
the insolent manner of the conquering race
the jewish party drove their animals off
the track to allow them to pass

  the jews cringed as the white-clad leaders
rode in haughty silence apparently unaware
of their presence the ragged mob of the
escort favored them with disdainful glances
a few muttered ya houdi jew accom-
panying the reproach with a contemptuous
spit

  but as the three came abreast of the two
women one a falcon-faced man deliber-
ately rode over to the elder of the two girls
pulled up his horse so that it barred her
donkeys progress and bending over in his
saddle peered insolently into her face as
he made a loud remark in arabic with
gleaming teeth and eyes afire the little
girl a few paces behind screamed in alarm
the men of their party stared helplessly

  the large sloe eyes of the girl were wide
with alarm as she tried to drive her donkey
round exclaiming

  zid zid go on

  the other horsemen who had slowed up
to see the fun laughed and shouted ribald
remarks the moor bent further over in
his saddle grinning wickedly miriams
eyes flashed angrily she swayed backward
in the saddle clutching with one hand to
keep her seat as she swung the other with
all her force in a resounding slap across her
persecutors face

  the man shot upright in his saddle like
a released spring speechless with indignant
amazement never in all his roving life
had he had such an experience from a
woman-and by allah a daughter of a
filthy jew

  miriam mad angry kicked her donkey
into motion and smacking his head on one
side-for she had no reins-piloted him
round an equestrian statue of a moor
the jews were dumb with fright fearing
instant retribution the mans compan-
ions continued to ride on slowly turning
in their saddles to watch the comedy
the moor stared blankly at miriam as
she passed him hesitated then breaking
into a volley of curses against the jews
the double scoop

ii

rammed home the sharp edge of his stirrups
and rode off with a clatter

  when miriam had time to look at her
companions she saw that they were yellow-
gray their teeth chattering like castanets
her anger died as the danger passed

  beard of my father stuttered yakub
know ye not who they were that was
the khalifa esha ben fila

  miriam recollected that this man was
the moorish governor of the district she
looked back and laughed feeling rather
perky over her triumph but her escort after
exchanging glances continued the march
in silence indeed miriam never quite
realized as the jews did that she had been
within an ace of having the whole party
massacred

  for another two hours the caravan
plodded along monotonously gradually de-
scending and nearing the great broad track
of the sus highway little zara riding
close to miriam could scarcely take her eyes
off the heroine of such a great adventure
breaking out into little giggles of admiration
it began to dawn upon miriam as con-
stantly changing her position on her un-
comfortable pack to gain five minutes
relief to her aching back and cramped limbs
that she had let herself into a very pre-
carious situation

  for some twenty awful minutes of de-
pression probably caused by the reaction
from the excitement and the trying con-
ditions of the journey she regretted that
she had ever undertaken the trip she
nursed too a sullen resentment against
the men of her escort despising them for
their craven attitude wholly forgetting
that they were unarmed and moreover
were of a race down-trodden and abused
for centuries by her aggressors people she
imagined with a thrill of the pride of race
of what would probably have happened
had alan been with her

  then the sequential train of thought
that she was on the verge of success and
scoring a point over alan and other men
brought back her self-confidence and put
her in an optimistic mood once more still
heartily did she wish that the aching
monotonous journey would come to an end
as she-let it not be whispered in gath-
scratched herself-for in every village and
tent in morocco there are many varieties
of insects-yearning mightily for a hot bath
and carbolic soap

at length as the sun reached
its zenith the mountain trail con-
verged into the main caravan road
scored by the tracks of countless camels
horses and mules within the next half-
hour upon rounding a shoulder of the hill-
side the blue of water leaped into view
awaking miriam from a tired and dusty
lethargy into drumming her donkeys ribs
impatiently with her bare heels by de-
grees appeared the mud huts of fonti
scattered low on the beach the rampart
walls along the foreshore beyond then
perched high upon a conical mass of black
rock washed in creamy foam a gray
moorish fort

  the town nestling between the walls lay
on the slope of a hillside some six hundred
feet above the water white and dazzling
in the sunshine outside the walls a gray
open space was crowded with a seething
mass of men and animals the sok-market-
place-upon the farther side outlining the
tops of fairy minarets and the rugged
turrets of the khalifas castle was the warm
dark-green of an olive plantation

  urging her donkey faster miriam came
up with yakub who had pulled up at a turn
of the trail commanding a view of the
harbor there was a look of relief on his
face as if rejoicing at the prospect of losing
the responsibility of his charge as he
exclaimed pointing a dirty finger

  look signorina agadir

  miriams heart gave an exultant leap
her eyes ran feverishly over the sweep of
the rocky land behind the bastion into the
curving blue of the headland ending in cape
ghir eighteen miles away like a gigantic
protecting arm forming an almost land-
locked harbor on the opposite low shore
some miles away was the commencement
of the sus plain through which near at
hand ran the wadu tamaraka and the
wadu sus low and out of sight

  as miriam an hour later passed beneath
the shadow of the babes-sus the main gate
of agadir with its huge metal-sheathed
nail-studded doors into the narrow cobbled
streets thronged with white-robed moors
elf-locked berbers impassive woolen-
garbed susi many negro slaves and a few
hooded women she felt that wonderful
thrill of exultation on the accomplishment
of a coveted ambition

  the excitement was fully sustained until
in a mean little house blue-washed as usual


adventure

but not like ben ibrahims small palace at
mogador miriam had leisure to take stock
of her temporary home her host was a
mildewed little man a snuffling wheezy
shylock rapacious-eyed and predatory of
nose the hostess a pallid bundle of dirty
clothes as a consolation there were two
little girls with gollywog eyes and pre-
cocious minds who seemed gifted with a
disinterested affection for miriam but
which little zara out of jealousy perhaps
instantly pronounced to be cupboard
love

  but that night as miriam after a lick
and a promise with the aid of a cracked
jar of water saw to the safety of her
baggage consisting of two fountain pens
a supply of ink and paper and a revolver
she was in an irritable state of mind as well
as body-particularly of body all the
romance of the great adventure seemed to
have died-bitten to death as miriam
expressed it savagely and when she had
retired to her allotted mattress she imag-
ined how alan would laugh at her

  then the visual picture of herself indig-
nantly denying it crying i- scratch
scratch-can stand it as well- scratch
scratch-as any man- scratch scratch
tickled her sense of humor the spell of
misery was broken as she wriggled her
head on the hard pillow made of a bundle
of robes and stretched her stiff and aching
limbs she chuckled

  the next day miriam spent in writing
she went for a ramble in the evening under
the escort of yakub to the ramparts over-
looking the bay keenly observing the en-
vironment and catechizing him fortu-
nately yakub was a native of the place
so that she was able to glean brief biog-
raphies and estimate the relative im-
portance of the notables including a
garbled history of the place-half of which
unfortunately long after the copy had been
sent away she sadly discovered to have
originated in the fertile brain of yakub
too eager to please

  he pointed out to her the palace of the
khalifa-a bad man and cruel according
to yakub-in the western end of the town
just beyond the principal mosque imme-
diately she desired to visit it yakub was
horrified he flatly refused to make any
attempt to take her through the town at
all until a bald promise of much backsheesh
set his wits to work eventually he arrived

at the conclusion that the visit might be
accomplished in company with two old
jewesses who were permitted to visit the
harem ladies to sell various trinkets and
trading stuffs but stipulating that it would
require still more hassani to bribe the
women

  as miriam made a faint effort at haggling
yakubs eyes glinted greedily as he tried
to think of some other tangible excuse for
extracting more money so it was settled
that the venture was to be made upon the
morrow

 miriam sat herself upon an ancient
cannon mounted upon a clumsy wooden
carriage the wheels of which were made
of thick planks of wood bound together
with heavy cross-laths the impotent muzzle
pointing through the embrasure command-
ing the bay away to the west of her was
the little fishing-village of fonti which they
had passed on their trail a few european-
built towing-boats lying upon the small
stretch of sand about half a mile out a
similar boat was approaching the town
the distant oar-blades sparkling in the sun
as she leaned idly admiring the deserted
blue waters of the bay there floated out the
call to prayer from the distant mosque

  al-lah ak-ba-ahl allah il allahi la
illaha il allah wa mohammed er-rasool
al-la-a-ahl

the call rising in three notes to a
high-pitched chant rang out eerie
and plaintive dying away in sweet
cadence to a faint echo in the hill beyond
to be caught up quite near her by another
mueddin

  the first time that miriam had heard
the call to prayer she had been deeply
impressed with the beauty and the calm
mystery in such antithesis to the fierce
lustful creed which it represented and
here in agadir isolated from any of her
kind the effect was intensified she glanced
across at yakub who was squatting in the
shade of the rampart staring craftily at
nothing an avaricious smile playing over
his mouth-probably thinking of the dollars
he was going to make

  she felt that time had buckled back into
the fifteenth century that she was in
another period for the medieval environ-
ment was perfect she found herself imag-
ining that yakub might well be the biblical
jacob as a young man noah she was sure
the double scoop



was the replica of the dignified ben ibrahim
at mogador

  an approaching footstep startled her
she looked up to see a man of medium
height in european clothes advancing
she stared for a moment unable to believe
her eyes then panic seized her that she
had failed after all that this man was some
correspondent who had stolen a march on
her he wore a shabby suit of gray a
light red tie a dirty collar and a small
artisans cap his lean face was shaped
like a hatchet two pale eyes peered sharply
over a predatory nose

  miriam glanced at yakub interrogatively
he appeared startled and put one finger
to ins lips suggestively miriam was
puzzled why should yakub fear this
man he was now quite close he glanced
at yakub and at her miriam felt the
contempt in the look and flushed with
annoyance forgetting the guise in which
he saw her then when nearly abreast of
her he turned his head abruptly as if vexed
at her scrutiny he was about to replace
a cigaret in his mouth but the hand re-
mained in mid-air as he paused and de-
liberately stared

  miriam wondered what paper he repre-
sented and tried to decide whether he was
english or not she thought not he
passed on looked round twice and as if
having made up his mind turned back and
came straight toward her miriam heard
a muttered exclamation from yakub sud-
denly recollecting that she was a jewess
she looked the other way and cast down
her eyes wondering what he was going to
do she felt an impulse to speak to him
in french it would be such a luxury
to talk to a fellow-european-even if he
were a rival correspondent-and if a for-
eigner it did not matter very much she
felt him look her up and down deliberately
insolently and involuntarily she blushed

  ashkoonik he demanded abruptly

  she heard yakub reply for her she
looked round at the stranger as he asked
another question in arabic which she could
not understand she decided that she did
not like the snarling curve of his lips under-
neath the yellow mustache as he smiled at
her

  je ne parle pas arabic she said curtly

  so vous parlez franqais eh cherie
he said

  insolently smiling he advanced a step

 toward her and lifted a hand as if to chuck
 her under the chin

 you dare exclaimed miriam angrily
 sliding off her gun

 the next instant she could have bitten
 her tongue off

 lieber gott

 he peered keenly at her

 you are english he said and sweeping
 off his cap apologized profusely

 he explained that he had meant no
 offense but thinking her to be a jewess
 he could not understand her imperious tone
 for quite three minutes he stood and ex-
 plained in fluent english whilst miriam
 weakening to his flattery lost her sudden
 antipathy

 my name is de bouche he continued

 baron de bouche whom have i-

 he raised his eyebrows interrogatively
 for a moment miriam hesitated
 miriam vickers is my name i am
 american she said are you a-for a
 newspaper

 nein-no i have business here-that
 is all he replied

 he appeared slightly disturbed at the
 mention of the press and eyed her sharply

 what paper are you here for then miss
 vickers

 oh none at all

 she scarcely knew why she had made the
 denial

 i am traveling-well she laughed
 deliciously suddenly developing a keen
 relish in diplomacy well to tell you the
 truth i came here disguised like this from
 mogador for fun more than anything else
 i had a friend with me but she wouldnt
 come but its been a delightful expe-
 rience-rather rash i thought at first

 she was pleased at her own faculty for
 embroidery she had looked him straight
 in the eyes as she had made the statement
 but he seemed too engrossed in admiring
 her face to be hypercritical

 so yes he replied it was rash
 you are returning now

 oh i dont know-perhaps when i
 get tired of the novelty

 so if you will pardon me offering
 advice it would be well for you to return
 soon this is no place for-forgive me-
 a handsome woman

 so i have discovered retorted miriam
 smiling

 so but you do not realize the danger


adventure

  he spoke emphatically but with the
manner of a man carrying on a rational
conversation and thinking about something
else at the same time his eyes never ceased
devouring her face and figure she became
uncomfortable and the antipathy returned

  oh im aware of the danger she said

  so

he talked on for some time in a
similar strain urging her to leave

yakub sat silent watching the two

at length miriam said that she was going
home and called to yakub the baron
bade her good night explaining that he
dared not escort her through the town for
fear of drawing the attention of the moors
to her

  who is that man yakub she inquired
as soon as they were out of earshot and in a
quiet lane

  es-sid-el keleeb returned yakub who
was obviously greatly perturbed

  why has he that name

  because he has been about morocco
for many years and used to have with him
always a little dog on horseback or mule
the dog was always with him that is why
the moors call him the master-of-the-little-
dog he is a bad man the moors and
jews alike hate him one day-

  yakub leered and drew a finger across
his throat

  at that moment although yakub chose
the most deserted way they came upon a
small sok of shops half-way through the
crowded space there was a cry of balaakl
balaku-make way-as preceded by
two ragged soldiers a swarthy-bearded
moor appeared clad in white riding on a
richly caparisoned horse

  el khalifa whispered yakub and drew
miriam aside into the throng to permit
the great man to pass

  the coal-black slave walking at the
horses head mocking the sultans pomp
and ceremony struck miriam across the
shins with a staff miriam stifled a cry as
yakub roughly dragged her farther into
the press she looked round angrily as
the yellow shoe and bare heel encased in
the shovel stirrup of the governor brushed
her hip to meet a pair of tired eyes squint-
ing down a falcon nose

  then to her horror she recognized him
as he pulled up his horse and bent over
toward her she heard a smothered whine

from yakub and a host of unintelligible re-
marks from the uncouth crowd about her
the khalifa was saying something to her

  she is my cousin ya sidi whined
yakub

  what is thy name jew

  miriam fascinated with fright mechani-
cally noted the lean brown hands holding
the crimson reins the thick sensual lips and
the pouched eyes

  yakub bin musa snuffled yakub

  the crowd was eagerly peering about
straining to catch a glimpse of the khalifas
new fancy several muttered curses and
contemptuous cries of houdi keleeb
rondi-dogs and jews she felt the
fierce scrutiny once more then he nodded
and with a word to his slaves rode on

  after the clattering escort had passed
yakub hurried her along amid laughs and
curses from the released mob humming
like a swarm of bees as soon as they were
in a quiet street once more yakub hastened
her along wailing that all was lost that
the khalifa was a bad man and bemoaning
their fate generally

  after this excitement had died down
miriam bribed yakub to keep silent on
the matter for she foresaw that the jewish
family would take fright and insist upon
her departure if they knew yakub even-
tually consented avarice overcoming fear

  that night she returned to her inter-
rupted topic of the baron upon which
yakub saie in the recesses of his house
proceeded to enlarge the baron vide
yakub spoke almost every european lan-
guage with equal fluency he had been
in morocco for some eight years engaged
in running arms and ammunition-a great
deal of it through agadir so yakub said-
and in trading or stealing cattle he was
treacherous and many parts of the country
were barred to him lest he meet the just
wrath of some swindled moor this was
interesting enough miriam thought but
it was not until yakub mentioned as if of no
importance that the baron was in league
with germany that miriams journalistic
instincts were fully aroused

  with germany how demanded
miriam

  senor baron said yakub has for a
long time spent much money money from
germany that is why the moors here
do not kill him he is under protection
of the khalifa
the double scoop



  yakub rubbed his forefinger and thumb
together the eloquent gesture signifying
dollars

  but what does he do here inquired
miriam eagerly

  he promises that germany shall help
the moors against the dogs of french-
but he lies observed yakub emphatically
why

  he lies he asserted gesturing he
pays many dollars to make them listen to
him as long as the river of dollars lasts
so long will they listen to him but when it
is dry-

  he leered suggestively

  but how do you know that he is acting
for germany

  they say these things in the sok-and
my aunt and cousin hear them from the
harem ladies of the khalifa senor baron
lives in a house of the khalifa yes it is
so said yakub and added nonchalantly
as he rose to his feet senor baron has
promised that a german war-ship will come
to agadir to prove his words-pah

  what exclaimed miriam agog war-
ship in agadir i was right she added
excitedly in english sit down yakub
are you sure when

  allah only knows-munana tomor-
row come signorina zara is calling to
supper

  but miriams pen was racing at top speed

two days had elapsed before
miriam was enabled to make the
promised visit to the harem of the
khalifa in the large tiled courtyard open-
ing on to the gardens she squatted in com-
pany with the two old jewesses whilst they
displayed their goods and haggled with
the ladies of the harem a motley group of
women a few old and haggard others
mere children of fourteen with dark sloe
eyes and velvet skins their fat arms-for
avoirdupois is beauty in moorish eyes-
smothered in silver bangles their hair and
ears similarly bedecked

  among the attendant slaves huge gross
eunuchs and negresses miriam noticed a
sweetly pretty half-caste lean and there-
fore despised she was as active as a
leopardess and had a petulant discon-
tented expression miriam made friends
with the aid of a silver bangle upon ob-
serving that she could speak spanish
her name was ramah and her face lit up

with mischievous pleasure on learning what
miriam desired her to do gossip is half
the soul of a moorish woman

  two three four more days passed and
still no sign of the promised diplomatic
coup miriam began to think uneasily of
those close-written sheets she had dis-
patched by special runner to her agent in
mogador except for an early morning
walk upon the ramparts approached by a
circuitous route in the vain hope of seeing
the war-ship miriam after the episode in
the sok was kept almost a close prisoner
in the jewish house on the third day to
miriams annoyance the baron walked into
the house he apologized for calling ex-
cusing himself on the grounds that he had
heard that she had not taken his advice
and was anxious for her safety

  he dismissed the jews from the room in
an autocratic manner miriam objected
but he feigned not to have heard her he
was a born raconteur he entertained her
with vivid stories of sport duelling in-
trigue and adventure in every capital in
europe to the wilds of borneo and china
he seemed to have been everywhere and
done everything-and everybody beating
down miriams antipathy until at times she
thought him the most fascinating man she
had ever met again he urged her to leave
gazing at her the whole time with undis-
guised admiration but miriam felt afraid
of the man and was relieved when he
departed

  one moonlight evening she arrived upon
the ramparts to see the somber shape of a
gunboat lying at anchor some two miles out
stealthy and ominous under the flocculent
sky she stared drinking in the sight and
thinking with a triumphant smile of alan
she was aroused from her pleasing reverie
by an exclamation from yakub and looked
up to see the baron approaching her

  ah good evening miss vickers
look look cried miriam forgetting
her dislike of the man and pointing across
the bay theres the war-ship

  the war-ship he repeated quickly

  i mean said miriam recollecting a
war-ship what is it a cruiser do tell
me and why is she here

  no its a gunboat returned the baron
coming close to her but i want to talk
of something else to you

  there was a thick note in his voice that
made miriam glance round at him
l

adventure

  briefly this he turned suddenly to
yakub and said harshly emshiit go

away

  yakub went a few paces watching the
baron with frightened eyes

  how dare you order my servant about
demanded miriam

  so i dare anything and anybody
when i wish said the baron quietly look-
ing at miriam hungrily i have warned
you to leave here you will not herr
gott-now i tell you i love you so
dont start from me he added with a
snarl intended for a smile as miriam shrank
from him you are in great danger
leave with me under my protection you
can not go by road i have a ship coming
in a few days you will come with me

  i shant do anything of the sort ex-
claimed miriam angrily although her heart
beat faster

  so when i want a thing i take it
said the baron watching her with a piercing
stare you will come with me

  no i will not you dare-

  so then choose-the khalifa has seen
you and seeks you you are the sort who
inflame mens minds think-imagine
what will happen to you-in the harem
so sid eisha has a taste for sweet woman-
hood-now little fool choose

   miriam grew pale as she realized her peril
her thoughts raced-if only alan   

   gott verdampf nochmal der teufel soils
holen-choose you devil-faced beauty

  a floccus of cloud obscured the moon

  i shall appeal for protection to that
war-ship out there she exclaimed point-
ing her finger across the bay

  the baron laughed

   so i think not little fool

  he took a step forward his eyes aflame
miriam in a panic whipped out her revolver
but with a catlike spring the baron seized
her wrist and twisted the gun out of her
hand

  yakub yakub she panted but yakub
had vanished

  the baron flung her from him lifted the
revolver over the parapet with the toe of
his boot and laughed in her face

  you she-devil he said i love you
all the more go home now and think it
over adios

  and with a ceremonious bow he turned
and walked off for a moment miriam
stared after him white and panting with

rage then as he disappeared round the
angle of the wall she buried her face in her
hands facing the placid gunboat out in the
bay and sobbed

chapter iv

like artless fawn each fair gazelle reposes
upon her forest couch of musk and roses

the air instinct with dreams of perfumed pleasure-
a sight i swear worth camel-loads of treasure

-sidi hammo

alan carfax arrived at rabat from

- fez very pleased with himself he had
intended to lie perdu for a while watching
events but to his disgust he received a per-
emptory cable informing him of a big news
scoop by an opposition paper from their
special correspondant at agadir prophesy-
ing the advent of a german war-ship alan
smiled skeptically but he began to wonder
who his rival might be

  he hurried on to mogador where he failed
to discover a trace of any man having passed
through finally he concluded that one
foote a wily individual of the daily post
had stolen a march by water there was
not even a rumor in mogador of any occu-
pation of agadir every one scoffed at such
an idea alan wrote a scathing article upon
the credulity of newspaper correspondents
in general and began preparations to set out
for agadir filled with an unholy joy at the
thought of the lemon he had handed to the
other man-whoever he might be

  but when a week later he rode preceded
by a weedy red-capped soldier of the
makhzen past fonti and up the slope
toward agadir he stared gloomily and
swore as he caught sight of the panther lying
on the sunlit waters grim and businesslike
but now   

  as he followed the soldier through the
camel-skin tents and groups of tribesmen
encamped in the outer sok he scarcely
noticed the scowls and muttered curses
against the infidel his brain incessantly
clamored for a solution of the problem he
saw that wretched scathing article appear-
ing and the ensuing wrath of his editor he
expected every moment to see the fat sar-
donic smile of charlie foote grinning tri-
umphantly at him in the white-walled
streets

  abd-el-kader the soldier had pulled up
and roused him from his reflections with the
remark that they must rest here
the double scoop



  fain demanded alan

  here returned the soldier now i
go to see the khalifa that he may give us-
if allah wills-a place to sleep

  alan frowned at the delay but by ex-
perience knew that it was inevitable so
abd-el-kader clattered away leaving alan
to squat in the shade of a wall in company
with his muleteers and servants to pass the
time in smoke and contemplation of allah
the all-merciful the muezzin was still
chanting while they waited

  as alan stared idly at the hovering flies
the clatter of hoofs made him look round to
see another european mounted on a coal-
black long-maned stallion at first alan
thought it was the redoubtable foote but
a second glance revealed a hatchet-faced
stranger the man pulled up in front of
him his animal curveting and snorting try-
ing to savage the meek steeds of alans party

  good afternoon said the man after a
piercing stare youre a correspondent i
suppose

  yes i am retorted alan taking um-
brage at the domineering tone who the
devil are you

  the man watched him with a quiet glare
curbing and sitting his resless mount like one
of the bersaglieri

  are you from the daily post demand-
ed alan

  the other smiled contemptuously

  no i have not that honor by the way
i would advise you to return to mogador

 why

  because you will find that this is not a
healthy spot for a meddlesome journalist
take my advice buenas noches and
loosing rein he galloped up the deep-rutted
street

  alan stood gazing after him he turned
to his men

  who is he

  a son of shaitan said a moor tone-
lessly es-sid-el-keleeb

  a few minutes afterward abd-el-kader
returned pulled up his rickety animal and
with an imperious wave of the hand beck-
oned them forward

  ajeel come

  ajee echoed alan angrily who the
devil are you talking to you brown-faced
baboon 

  ajee repeated abd-el-kader with a
face of bronze and turning rode slowly up
the street

  alan would have dearly loved to have
knocked him down but he knew that he
dared not on the trip abd-el-kader had
been most affable but now    what

was the reason

  following the line of the walls abd-el-
kader halted at last in a bare open space on
the ramparts and intimated that they were
to camp there alan objected but was
curtly told that such was the khalifas order
he raged inwardly and demanded to be
taken to the khalifa in person at first
abd-el-kader refused saying that he was
too tired alan mounted and rode off by
himself followed presently by abd-el-
kader muttering pious curses on all infidels

  they arrived at the outer courtyard of the
palace where abd-el-kader conversed apart
with one of the khalifas soldiers who
glanced in alans direction nodded and de-
parted abd-el-kader squatted on the
cobbles in the corner produced a kiff pipe
and placidly proceeded to smoke

  has he gone to tell the khalifa de-
manded alan

  if allah wills returned abd-el-kader
exhaling smoke in a voice devoid of ex-
pression

  when shall we see him

  when allah wills

  i must see him now-quickly-under-
stand

  allah is all merciful

  alan bit his lip and swore softly

  half an hour passed slowly the horses
fidgeted flicking at the flies with their long
tails abd-el-kader smoked with the eternal
placidity of a buddha there was no other
sign of life the elongated shadows grew
denser

  is he going to see me or notdemanded
alan

  if allah wills came the placid reply
alan swore violently and curbed himself
he had been through similar ordeals so
often

  who is that other roumi european
here he inquired presently

  allah only knows

  abd-el-kader

  abd-el-kader looked up sleepily from his
pipe with cold expressionless eyes

  what ails thee

  allah only knows

  alan gave it up he felt a wild desire to
attack some one violently-abd-el-kader
for choice-and getting up fell to pacing
i

adventure

slowly the courtyard once a red-capped
soldier appeared stared at them with in-
curious eyes and vanished

       then as he turned on his quarter-
deck march he became aware of
some one watching him he
glanced up and caught a glimpse of a pair
of large bright eyes set in a frame of blue-
black hair he glanced at abd-el-kader
him absorbing dreams of paradise through
the narrow pipe-stem as alan came back
he watched the eyes came above the
level of the wall twinkled and were fol-
lowed by the face a creamy olive-tinted
face with pomegranate lips and pearly teeth
disclosed in a shy smile

  alan forgot his annoyance and halted just
below the wall the huge silver ear-
rings wobbled violently the face disap-
peared and shot up again peering curiously
down at him alan seemed to have for-
gotten his pose as a misogynist he glanced
round cautiously

  who art thou he asked

  ra-mah came the reply deliciously
sweet small hands with henna-stained
nails came over the wall the whole of her
bust appeared and the girl gazed at him
ardently

  thou are beautiful to look upon oh
roumi she announced with the naive in-
nocence of a wild creature

  oh said alan inanely and blushed

  when he raised his eyes again-feeling
an awful fool as he expressed it-she was
still watching him with longing eyes

  what dost thou oh roumi she in-
quired curiously

  i am seeking audience with the khalifa
answered alan glad to escape from an em-
barrassing topic

  she smiled-gloriously alan thought
involuntarily

  thou wilt not speak with him this day
she said for he is now with his women in
the garden

  barakolofikl thank you exclaimed
alan as he flushed with rage at the thought
of the deliberate way in which he had been
fooled

  mahababbikutn a thousand times
welcome she smiled at him where
dost thou live

  my tent will be pitched by the further
ramparts he replied somewhat sulkily
who art thou oh ramah

  i am but the slave of the khalifa she
said but i find no favor in his sight
there was a long pause

  youre - pretty exclaimed alan

suddenly in english

  her eyes welled with delight the whole
of her face seemed transfigured as she read
the flare of admiration in his eyes

  hamdullahl allah be praised  she ex-
claimed that i please my lord

  and immediately alan became self-con-
scious

  i must go he said sharply good
night oh ramah

  allah watch over thee she responded
softly

  he awakened abd-el-kader far gone in
the realms of kiff with difficulty as they
neared the site of his camp he came upon a
jew and jewess walking still thinking of
ramah he glanced idly at the girl started
and looked again she was watching him
and as he passed her she peered up into his
face and laughed

  good god exclaimed alan turning in
his saddle what an extraordinary resem-
blance if- she turned and laughed
again why thats miriams double
alan had much to think of that evening
of his position of ramah and not a little of
miriam amid the roar of fleet street he
fell asleep-to dream of ramah-who mys-
teriously changed like a dissolving view
into miriam

  next morning as the rising sun tipped the
minarets and white-topped roofs in a rosy
flood alan rode up to the khalifas palace
once more in company with one bu shaib
a red-bearded son of the riff this time
the outer courtyard held a dozen horses
and mules some of their owners seeking
audience squatted patiently along the wall

  for over two hours alan waited seeing
one man after another summoned at
length when the last of the moors had rid-
den away a huge black slave in white with
an enormous silver-hilted scimitar slung
by a red sash appeared at the inner gate

and bawled out-

  let the nazarene come to ray lord
alan rose and was ushered into the inner
courtyard where he found the khalifa esha
ben fila seated cross-legged upon a carpet
in the shade of an arch his eyes pouched
and heavy appeared impassively sullen

  a leather cushicn or footstool was lying
in the full glare of the sun on which alan
the double scoop



was told to sit for a minute or two the
khalifa feigned to be unaware of his presence
continuing to talk in shilhah - a berber
language of which alan knew no word-to a
scribe who sat at his feet with his horn and
paper

  alan broke in with the orthodox saluta-
tion ben fila glanced carelessly at him
as one might on noticing a cat in the room
and nodded mumbling unintelligible an-
swers to the series of greetings although
boiling with rage inwardly alan knew suf-
ficient of oriental ways to simulate calm in-
difference at length after the preamble
alan approached the object of his visit
he had arrived the previous day he ex-
plained and demanded to know why he was
not received in the customary manner and
given a house for himself and his followers

  hast thou letters from the makhzen
government inquired the khalifa in a
level bored tone

  nay it is not necessary returned
alan i have with me a soldier from kaid
gilhooli the protection of the kaid

  there are many soldiers in the empire of
the sultan-whom allah bless

  in fez and marakesh it was not neces-
sary to have letters

  the ways of the north are not the ways
of the south

  i demand protection and a house
  allah is great if allah wills

 i shall make complaint to kaid
gilhooli

  if allah wills

 when today

  if allah wills

  the khalifas eyes had fastened upon a
pair of field-glasses slung across the english-
mans shoulders he bent and whispered

in the scribes ear said the scribe-

  el khalifa wishes to see those glasses
but alan knew from the whole attitude
of the reception that they were hostile to
him evidently in the pay of the stranger on
the black stallion alan began to lose con-
trol of his temper-a fatal thing in oriental
diplomacy he knew that the request to
see the glasses meant that the khalifa
coveted them as a gift but he was too angry
to play out the moorish game

  no he said to the khalifa they are not
for sale and knowing that the khalifa and
gilhooli hated each other repeated if i
am not treated properly i shall return and
make complaint to kaid gilhooli

  if allah wills returned the khalifa
imperturbably

  the english government is powerful

supplemented alan

  allah is all merciful

  alan without further ado got up and
walked out returning veiled insults with an
open one

as alan rode off he passed three
german naval officers mounted on
moorish horses with an escort of
sailors marching like infantrymen they
were the source of his troubles he reflected
savagely returning to his camp he sat on
the ramparts alongside one of the ancient
guns which ironically was trained right
on the grim little shape of the panther out
in the bay

  whilst he sat there composing a vicious
article scathing in the inference to the lost
prestige of england a german naval order-
ly approached and handed him a note an
invitation to lunch from the commander of
the gunboat alan accepted and as he
walked down to the beach after a wash
thought what a sardonic sense of humor the
germans had

  the lunch passed off well most of the
officers spoke english and moreover alan
more than appreciated the table delicacies
and wine over coffee and cigars the com-
mander gave his version of the reason of
their visit which-to alans private amaze-
ment-consisted in the german commercial
interests in the sus he was given to
understand he continued that alan had
met with some opposition or difficulty with
the khalifa the moors were very obtuse
people at times but the commander would
be most happy to offer alan the protection
of his imperial majesty the emperor

  in a flash alan saw scare - head

placards-

  englishman seeks german protection in
morocco

  with a thin yorkshire smfle he thanked
herr commander very much for his offer
but regretted that he was unable to avail
himself of it

  he was rowed back to the black rock land-
ing-place with a wee small glow of satisfac-
tion that he had managed to circumvent
that subtle little move only to receive
checkmate when he arrived at the camp
from the fire a red-capped soldier rose up
and briefly informed him that by the


adventure

khalifas orders he was to leave the city on
the morrow

  go to the devil alan exclaimed angrily
and although the moor did not understand
he cursed him fluently and piously as he
turned away

  the sun set behind cape ghir in a flood of
crimson and purple dying the sea and tinting
the gunboat in blood

  alan moodily contemplated the situation
in the chaos of his mind he remembered
miriam and smiled indulgently as he
thought of her silly boasts and idea of wo-
men journalists what indeed could a wo-
man do imagine a woman journalist in his
shoes now good heavens it was farcical
he would use the episode to shatter
miriams insane arguments when he got
home then as the sun dipped and violet
twilight wrapped the world a fit of de-
pression seized him he had been lucky
before this was his first defeat and it
seemed bitter particularly when it might
have been the greatest scoop in the journal-
istic world for years

  that confounded alien mongrel on the
black horse was the mysterious special
correspondent and the german combined-
playing traitor as spies usually did he was
the german commerical interests in
southern morocco-the sus where there
was no european trade at all that con-
clusion cheered him a little it would
make a scorching article

  a light silvery laugh startled him he
turned sharply to see the hooded figure of a
woman a pair of brilliant eyes twinkling
at him above the blanket hoik

  ramah he cried as she lowered it
  e-eh oh roumi

  how didst thou come-

  s-shwith one henna-stained linger to
lips i come to warn thee come

  she glided into his tent which sheltered
them from the sight of the men around the
fire

  listen oh aziz- he hardly noticed
the endearing term in his excitement-
es-sid-el-keleeb and the khalifa my
master-lying in the garden i did hear them
talk if thou are not gone by the morrow
theyplottokill thee but thou must not go
nay i will not exclaimed alan his
pugnacity aroused by the news

  nay but thou must she adjured him
apparently inconsistently but only to re-
turn oh my beloved

  again the superlative term which he did
not heed she drew closer to him

  wilt thou trust thyself to me she
demanded

  yes of course he answered absently in
english thinking hard

  what sayest thou

  eh yea ramah i agree it is good
little one

  listen tomorrow thou wilt go thou
and thy servants and make thy camp beside
fonti on the beach

  mezian it shall be done and then
  wait until i come for thee

  mezian he assented and intent upon
his professional interests failed to notice
her reproachful eyes as her dim form melted
into the shadows

chapter v

vast as creation yet when all is said

how short the words that make our weal or wo

-sidi hammo

that evening as the darkling night
swallowed up the plain of the sus
miriam uneasily watched fear put avarice
to flight in the hearts of her jewish hosts
yakub had broken faith and told of the
scene on the ramparts between miriam and
the baron with the result that old yusuf
and his pallid wife clamorously insisted that
miriam must depart from agadir before
worse befall or at least that she must leave
their house they feared and hated the
baron as the evil one and hand in glove
with the khalifa allah only knew what
might not befall them miriam offered
more money but with an effort that wrung
rheumy tears from the old mans eyes he
refused

  miriam although fearful of the impor-
tunities of the baron did not intend to
leave agadir in ignominious flight the
more pressing the circumstances became
the more tremulously stubborn she grew
she had heard from yakub via the sok of
alans arrival so that she was not sur-
prised to pass him in the streets she had
imagined that he would know her but
when she observed the lack of recognition
in his eyes she laughed and passed on in-
tensely amused

  at the first intimation from yusuf ben
the double scoop



musa that she must leave the house she
had naturally thought of taking refuge with
alan whom she imagined to be quite au fait
with the authorities as she had observed
him embark for the gunboat but on sec-
ond thoughts the idea smattered too much
of humiliation eventually she concluded
that it was a choice of two evils-refuge or
ignominious flight so she reluctantly de-
cided tto descend upon the unsuspecting
alan next day

  as she sat in the courtyard with little
zara staring at the square of scintillating
stars above she tried to console hejrself-
half-defiantly-that whatever happened she
had secured the creme dc la crime of the
scoop and wandered mentally to fleet
street thinking of herself as the heroine of
the hour then a thought of the baron
who had maintained an ominous silence
since the episode sent a cold shudder of ap-
prehension down her spine it required
little imagination to realize that in such an
out-of-the-way barbarous spot many dread-
ful things might happen to a woman

  in an access of impotent rage she cursed
her sex for their inherent weakness it was
all so bitterly unfair she looked at zara
in the gloom and wondered if it were not
better to be of her type the oriental
woman frankly a toy for mans leisure mo-
ments dumb uncomplaining not dream-
ing of the liberty and understanding which
might and should be theirs

  it was an idea born of momentary weak-
ness of which she felt ashamed the next
moment yet everything seemed so cruel
and heartless a kicking against the pricks
of fate a passionate desire suddenly
welled up within her to cry peccavi to run
to alan and throwing her arms round his
neck to sob her heart out she had to set
her teeth to conquer the surge of emotion
it passed she smiled bitterly in the dark-
ness

  at that moment there was a patter of
small slippered feet one of the gollywog
little jewesses rushed excitedly into the
courtyard swinging a candle lantern and
crying out upon her father in hebrew in
a moment yakub and the rest of the family
were gathered in a gesticulating group
out of the medley of voices miriam heard
yakub crying at her

  thou hast brought this upon us we
are lost

  miriam got up and went over to them

  eh-eh yelled yakub wildly waving
his palms

  the little girl held the lantern up and
pointed a tragic finger at her screaming
shrilly the old man wrung his hands and
the wife literally howled

  it was some minutes ere miriam could
interpret anything intelligible from the
hubbub then little zara the only one
who had not lost control of herself ex-
plained that the little girl had just come
from the palace with the news that the
khalifa had at last discovered the abode of
the pretty jewess with whom he had fallen
in love one day in the sok

  the baron has executed his threat
thought miriam she went very white for
she divined what this might mean

  and he hath sworn that he will take
you into his harem ivalii-ivalii zara
broke out they will come for thee and
kill the rest of us walli wo is me

  there was renewed pandemonium the
upshot was that they were hysterically de-
termined to throw miriam out of the house
then and there to save themselves little
zara remonstrated crying shrilly that
miriam might be hidden away but this
suggestion was met with howls proclaim-
ing that death was sure if she were not
found by the khalifas people

  old yusuf stood by the arch leading to
the door wringing his hands he implored her
to go and called upon all the prophets of the
pentateuch the wife wailed helplessly be-
side him the child with the lantern dashed
excitedly between miriam and her father
like an erratic dragonfly clutching at her
clothes whilst yakub gibbering with craven
fear hovered about miriam trying to sum-
mon sufficient courage to eject her forcibly
miriam with faithful little zara clinging to
one arm defied them-head up and curling
lips-in a mixture of anglo-spanish cum
franco-arabic

then in the midst of the uproar
there was a fresh commotion at the
door old yusuf shrieked and was
sent flying on to his face the child dropped
the lantern which spluttered and went out
as a group of armed men burst into the
courtyard there was a moment of para-
lyzed silence the leader a tall hawk-
faced arab peered round by the aid of a
lantern carried by a negro then simul-
taneously the howls broke out afresh as


adventure

miriam darted behind a pillar the men
swooped upon her in a trice rough hands
seized her a blanket was bundled over
her head she felt herself lifted by wiry
arms struggling violently mad with rage
she was borne swiftly away

  the enveloping blanket produced the suf-
focation of a nightmare the powerful arms
that dreadful sense of impotence miriam
struggled futilely until she collapsed into a
limp burden from sheer exhaustion in
which she dimly heard the mutter of voices
and scuffle of animals the sensation of
being lifted in the air roused her to another
paroxysm she felt the gentle undulating
motion of a horse or mule walking and the
muffled klop hop of hoofs upon cobbles

  the journey seemed to last for hours
as her senses began to revive a little she
became acutely conscious that the coarse
hair of the blanket scratched her face and
lips forcing a pungent acrid taste into her
mouth the chaos of her mind caused by
the shock began to clear lucid thoughts
sped swiftly she jumped to the conclu-
sion that she was being taken to the kha-
lifas palace in a second of time her imagi-
nation painted a vivid picture of what her
fate would be she shuddered and groaned
with anguish wildly she thought of ways
to escape of some method to take her own
life rather than 

  a nausea overwhelmed her she lost
sense of time and space

  then after an eternity she became con-
scious that she was lying on something soft
and that the cool night air was fanning her
cheeks she drew a long breath sighed and
opened her eyes bending over his sharp
features in the light of a lantern was the
baron

  he must have rescued her then a feel-
ing of relief and gratitude glowed for a mo-
ment he at least could never be so terri-
ble as a moor the baron was holding a
glass of brandy which he bade her drink in
a curiously low tone strange miriam
wondered with that irrelevance of thoughts
in moments of distress why his voice was
so soft like a gentle purr it seemed she
gazed at him and tried to think what was
going to happen but the one idea of the
gentleness of his voice seemed to obsess
her brain

  he was talking about something but she
could not grasp the sense then the alcohol
began to take effect she found her mind

coming under control again and began to
comprehend what he was saying some-
thing about regrets for some action what
for rescuing her how absurd she tried
to thank him but found her lips were stiff
and swollen the liquor stung them too

  you are feeling better he inquired

  miriam mumbled inarticulately

  so allow me

  then he bent down and rearranged some
of the cushions how kind he was the
baron the predominant terror that she
was about to fall into the savage moors
power had for the time driven the barons
character from her mind then the asso-
ciation of ideas stirred the memory cells
into activity she sat up spurred by the
idea

  my god she gasped thickly did
you kidnap me

  the baron had put down the lantern-
there was no one else in the starlit court-
yard-and was sitting beside her his
mouth twisted into that snarling smile

  if you like he said shrugging his
shoulders to put it so crudely so as
miriam made a movement of disgust
you beautiful little fool he said bending
toward her i saved you from a vile fate
that black swine was going to take you
herr gotti what do you think i have risked
for you liebchen everything for you
eight years have i plotted and schemed for
an empire-ja here in the sus it is with-
in my grasp and gott im himmel i play with
it-for you

  he grasped her wist and kissed her hand
she shrank away from him but his grip
was like a steel trap

  so he snarled mein lieber gott you
lovely fool i will tame you ja i meant
to take you but not until i was ready
then that cochon of a moor-in two days
my boat will be here to take us-us you
angel devil to cape juby where we two
will be the german interests in the sus a
nice honeymoon eh liebchen but well
spend the first two days here so

  there was a pause holding her a pris-
oner by the wrist he devoured her panting
quivering figure with his eyes voices and
the clatter of horses sounded some distance
away

  give me a kiss liebchen he demanded
thickly and leaned toward her

  miriam shrieked and made a frantic
effort to tear her wrist loose he sat back
the double scoop



retaining his hold and chuckled as he
watched her struggle and scream

   shriek you sweet little devil you he
said with an evil smile womens screams
are music in morocco-so come thats
enough and he drew her to him

  miriam kicked madly and beat him with
the one free hand like the wing of a cap-
tured bird

suddenly came a guttural oath
the baron was lifted bodily from
her releasing his hold at the bidding
of the instinct of self-preservation miriam
fell back panting wild-eyed to find the
room full of red-capped sodliers creatures
of the khalifa in a flash she realized that
nemesis had overtaken the baron in the
jealous wrath of the khalifa but that she
was reserved for a worse fate amid the
guttural remarks of the moors she saw in
the light of several lanterns the baron as
helpless as a trussed fowl his face distorted
with rage in the hands of a gigantic negro
slave who grinned with hellish delight

   a wild thought of self-destruction flashed -
athwart her mind but before she had time
to recover even her power of speech two
soldiers unceremoniously lifted her by the
shoulders and ankles and carried her out
she felt too stunned and helpless to offer
futile resistance this time numbed with
awful fear she was hoisted on to the pom-
mel before a mounted negro there was
the dim scuffle of horses and men harsh
commands and exclamations then the
cavalcade started forward miriam ex-
hausted and beaten sobbing swung limp
to the motion of the horse

  as the procession climbed up the dusty
narrow streets toward the governors palace
the early morning call to prayer rang out
resonant and clear beneath the shimmering
stars

  allah-ak-ba-ak- la illaha u-

  miriam did not swoon this time her
emotions seemed too overworked to re-
spond only the gasping sob and the dull
ache of choking fear the flickering lights
of the lanterns carried by the slaves on foot
danced ghostlike on the white walls the
dark of the head of her captor was sharply
silhouetted against the stars they seemed
to rock and sway giddily she wondered
vaguely why the face was beardless a
cock crowed near by the muezzin was
still chanting

  allah akbah-there is no god save al-
lah

  the stars were blotted out sounds re-
echoed loudly under an arch the stars
flashed at her again the horse stopped
she was lifted down and carried into the
gloom of a room somebody placed her on
something soft and yielding she did not
know what it was nor care she ached all
over she felt sick and tired mentally and
physically-oh so tired and weary noth-
ing mattered

  there was somebody moving about her
she wished they would leave her in peace
she seemed to have been ill-used miserable
and tired ever since she could remember
feebly she wanted to die-but she knew
that she could not die because her heart
kept leaping within her bosom

  a light flashed in her eyes she blinked
and saw an enormously fat woman leering
at her huge earrings bobbed under the
black hair she was saying something in
arabic she handed the lantern to some-
body and laid her fat fingers on the shoulder
cords of miriams robe the touch aroused
her spurred her into a frenzy dispelling
the mental paralysis sent a thousand awful
thoughts searing her brain she uttered a
soundless scream and half-leaped half-
wriggled off the bed she fell on to the
floor scrambled into a corner crying half-
articulately

  no no no no

  as the odalisque laughing hideously
advanced round the bed a deep guttural
voice sounded behind her she made some
reply received a curt order and fled

  in the dim light miriam saw the figure
of the khalifa she watched him with the
fascination of a rabbit about to be devoured
by a snake he walked silently across in
his bare feet took up the lantern and ad-
vanced toward his victim stroking his
beard and smiling he said something in
arabic the proximity of the danger cooled
miriam made her think with lightning
rapidity she had no means except her
hands to protect herself she was abso-
lutely in this mans power if only
alan    her soul cried to him for
aid

  ana americana she said desperately
watching him keenly

  he started and peered at her closely

  ash

  ana-americana she repeated louder


adventure

  her heart beat faster with wild hope
he spoke quickly lowered the lantern and
examined her he seemed perturbed and
puzzled miriam took heart

  look she cried in english standing up
i-am-american tapping her bosom
 american-i-go-mogador-sueira-
american consul fahamshi understand

  the word consul seemed to convince
him

  subhan allahl he exclaimed and
stepped back a pace

  miriam over-eager stepped aside

  la la lie said quickly gesturing a
negative

  miriam stopped and stood watching
his impassive face as he gazed at
her

  he was thinking swiftly this girl was
as no other woman he had ever seen she
was not a jewess as he had supposed but a
european that was no odds both were
infidels cursed dogs of unbelievers but
the roumis were powerful-here on the
coast there was a roumi war-ship in the
harbor if he took this girl they might re-
taliate by bombarding the town they
needed an excuse to do so he well
knew

  no there were many dollars to be had
from the roumis yet-yillahl the girl
was beautiful he looked at her as a con-
noisseur he could retain her for two per-
haps three years and even then she would
still be worth a thousand dollars and who
would know that son of shame that pig
of an unbeliever es-sid-el-keleeb he
would soon be paying for his insult to the
beloved of mahomet his eyes wandered
hungrily over her again no by allah no
accursed nazarene should stand between
him and his desire he would away to his
kasbat in the sus the roumis-allah
was a powerful

  miriam saw the change saw the fire of
passion rekindle in his eyes and nerved her-
self for an effort-if only to obtain a weapon
to kill herself as he smiled evilly she
made a desperate spring to pass him he
caught her by the voluminous sleeve she
hit out wildly and the whole of her soul
leaped into the name of her beloved

  alan al-an

  the lantern was dropped in the struggle
and lay spluttering an awful minute in
which the brutes arms were round her
his breath in her face   

gjffls meanwhile alan had shifted
his camp to the beach near fonti
long after sunset the hooded
ghostly figure appeared she had brought
a jellab for him to wear above his european
clothes a sufficient night disguise strik-
ing up the hill she led him by a rough and
broken path to the northern corner of the
city wall where by a ruined bastion they
made entrance into the narrow streets

  once the tramp and jingle of men and
horses drove them to shrink in the dark
shadow of a gate a crowd of soldiers and
slaves on foot and horse passed them the
leader a hawk-faced arab made remark as
he passed

  may allah burn all infidels that dog
es-sid-el-keleeb hath surely eaten of our
masters sweets great will be his wrath
by allah

  what doth he mean ramah whis-
pered alan

  es-sidi hath taken a hunger for a jewess
but es-sid-el-keleeb hath stolen the bird
answered ramah s-sh let us hasten

  together they followed the band of night
marauders to the khalifas palace where by
a postern gate ramah admitted alan to a
deserted part of the rambling gardens
here in a small room she bade him rest
whilst she brought food and lights while
he waited patiently in the gloom his
thoughts turned to miriam ever since the
night before when ramah had kissed him
the image of miriam kept recurring to his
mind strange he thought and sought for
a reason but not being practised in emo-
tional analysis it eluded him

  as ramah returned with a lantern carry-
ing a basket of food the early morning call
to prayer rang out from the adjacent
mosque as ramah approached she seemed
to take the form of miriam

  her great eyes shone as she set the feast
she brought news that there was a great
commotion in the palace as the khalifa was
mad with rage at being balked of his prey
and that he had dispatched a force to cap-
ture es-sid-el-keleeb with orders to send
him to his kasbah ninety miles in the in-
terior and on pain of death to bring back
the girl to him

  alan felt a sudden fear grip him for
miriams safety-which was absurd for
miriam was in london yet a voice seemed
to whisper

  alan oh alan
the double scoop



whats that he excalimed starting up

but only the cry of the muezzin an-
swered him

 what ails thee oh aztiz queried ra-
 mah anxiously

 nothing said alan and relapsed into
 silence answering ramahs chatter in
 monosyllables

 gradually ramahs efforts began to thaw
 him

presently as she sat beside him there
came the sound of the clatter of a cavalcade
again he thought of miriam he glanced
at ramah how like miriam she seemed
he felt a desire to kiss her her large soft
eyes invited him

then the sound of a stifled scream
brought him to his feet he listened in-
tently

 it is but some slave being beaten said
 ramah petulantly or mayhap the jewess
 i told thee of

 there was a long pause in which alan felt
 certain of the proximity of miriam he
 stood at the door staring into the violet
 black shadows of the garden

there came distinct and close a wild
broken cry

alan al-an

 alan dashed madly in the direction fumb-
 ling for his revolver as he ran hearing
 seemingly at a great distance the voice of
 ramah crying

come back to me beloved leave me
not oh aziet

 a tall figure in robes stood over miriam
 clutching her shoulder with one hand
 alans face peered amazedly into hers

 my god miriam he cried

 alan oh alan she panted

 in the meantime the khalifa had recov-
 ered from the shock of the wrench and had
 summoned his guards

 alan turned revolver in hand to find
 the room full of slaves and soldiers mostly
 armed with scimitars thrusting miriam
 behind him he covered the khalifa crying
 in arabic-

 at the first move thou art dead

the men hesitated and looked at their
chief who stood by the bed glaring at alan

 tell these men to go alan continued
 this woman is american--fahamshi

 he drew back the hammer of the revolver
 with an ominous click the khalifa backed

and muttered a rapid order

  nam sidi chorused the men and
filed out miriam stood behind alan her
breast heaving her eyes devouring his face

  sit down and rest somewhere darling
he said without turning or lowering his
pistol

  she flushed at the endearing term un-
conscious upon his part and obeyed the
khalifa never removed his eyes from the
steady revolver muzzle

  now said alan standing over him like
a young god either you give us a safe
conduct to mogador-or i go to the ger-
mans they will blow agadir to pieces
choose

  the khalifa did not hesitate a mad and
armed infidel was not to his liking

  it is the will of allah thou and the
girl shall start at once for mogador

  if there is any treachery thou and thy
people will suffer for it swear

  on the beard of my lord mohammed i
swear it answered the khalifa may
allah the all merciful the all forgiving
curse thee he added piously

  go and give orders for our departure
said alan lowering the revolver and re-
member thy oath

  the khalifa departed slowly retaining his
dignity for which and the absence of whin-
ing excuses alan forgave him much

  he turned and in the dim light looked at
miriam half-sitting on the edge of the huge
bed

  my god little woman he said and
took her in his arms

  in a moment or two there was the low
throat-laugh of a womans triumph

  you great dear darling she whispered
half-tearfully i knew that months and
months ago

  but neither noticed the patter of little
slippers at the door as ramah with a chok-
ing sob stole softly away to the solitude
of a roof-top to hide her passionate grief
like a stricken fawn

  as the violet wings of the dawn flew be-
fore the pageant of the sun she watched
the lovers ride out of the city gate the kha-
lifas escort about them then she real-
ized dimly that her dream of love was over
the gates of paradise were shut in her face
that she was left to sink into the sordid
slough of an odalisque
the ferret anchheef

               by j allan dunn

aulor of the bully the marooncr etc

    ihe ferret could have reported
the conversation between the
  warden and the man from head-
wf h quarters very accurately that
part of it at least that generalized upon
himself and the three others who were to
leave the penitentiary that morning having
it was supposed if not generally practised
fully expiated their crimes and being re-
stored to freedom if not full citizenship
for the ferret was very very far from being
a fool

  once a crook always a crook an-
nounced the detective somewhat wearily
you wait till they begin coming back to
you i aint running down your dope
or your methods but youre new to the
game if youll pardon my saying so
theres a heap of improvement needed in
penitentiaries ill grant you but all your
honor system your free talk and your
baseball games aint going to make an
honest man out of a blown-in-the-glass
crook do what you will with em they
figure the mistake they made was in getting
caught not in the crime itself

   they come in sore and they go out sore
for all your coddling of em you cant
make em glad to be here a man in a cell
nurses a grouch and a guy with a grouch aint
going to repent he may think it pays best
to run straight but he gets out and he reads
about something good that was pulled off
and then he meets his woman or some
tvoman and then some of the gang come

around and show him an easy thing well-
hes sick of prison grub and prison fare and
sos his woman of the skimping shes done
while he was in the excitement gets
him-and then we get him and you see
him registering at your hotel inside of a few
months at best

  take it from me mr warden i know
em once a crook always a crook take
the ferret first-class cracksman and high-
flier going out today after five years less
eight months for behaving himself hell
be back ill bet you a months pay hell
be back inside of six months or if he isnt
well be looking for him why was he good
in quod because he wanted to get out of
quod not because he means to go
straight

  ill take that bet henderson said the
new warden quietly call it an even
hundred you know only the seamy
side of human nature theres a right and
wrong side to every man but you never
turn over the goods to have a look at the
pattern that was intended to be shown a
crook may be always a crook but all con-
victs are not crooks henderson circum-
stance environment desire of that same
excitement you mentioned-the same sort of
desire that sent men viking in old times have
a lot to do with it the ferret he broke
off to smile do you know what the ferret
has been doing and what he wants to do

  id make another little bet on the last
end of it what has he been doing


the ferret and the bet



  doing wonderful things in my garden
and greenhouse the man is a born genius
with grafting and crossing

  i believe all of that said henderson
double-crossing and grafting are easy to
him

  and he wants-wait well have him
in and ask him

  the ferret was escorted in he might
have been anywhere between forty and
fifty his hair that had been allowed to
grow since his time of freedom approached
was long enough to be laid back in a smooth
gray pompadour the forehead was well-
shaped the nose well-chiseled and the
mouth neither small nor thin-lipped his
eyes-henderson would have called them
cunning-to the warden they were shrewd
he was slight but built with all the sug-
gestive agility of the animal after which
the underworld had christened him

  the work among the wardens shrubs
and flowers had banished all trace of prison
pallor his cheap ready-made suit fitted
him surprisingly well he looked not at all
like a discharged prisoner not at all like a
malefactor a wizard at coaxing combina-
tions and blowing stubborner safes-he had
used oxy-acetylene on the last one his
hands might have been those of a wood-
carver a musician even or a master-
gardener

  though henderson would have set them
down as the hands of a forger or a master-
cracksman and he stood respectful with a
certain dignity quite at his ease the hint
of an ironic smile on his lips for henderson
the gleam of a friendly one in his eyes for
the warden

  what are you figuring on doing
rogers asked the latter in kindly fashion

  i should like to take up the raising of
fancy shrubs sir answered the ferret
ignoring hendersons grin at his words
it takes more capital than i have to go
into it properly it would take a thousand
dollars before id get any return but ill go
at it quietly if i can get an opening
henderson snickered

  be careful of the kind of opening you
choose ferret he said too bad you
aint got something tucked away to start
you out now see here ferret i aint up
here on your account so dont let that
worry you

  i wont mr henderson

  henderson flushed a little at the irony

he had been the chief instrument in sending
the ferret up for his stretch but it had not
been his cleverness it had been through
the treachery of a stool-pigeon and he felt
that the ferret did not rate his professional
acumen over-highly

  the warden tells me you are trying to
go on the level he said you go ahead
and raise fancy shrubs all you want ill
never bother you but im going to be on
the level with you ive made a little bet
with the warden here never mind for how
much or how long that youll be tapping
the tumblers again now ill warn you
im going to keep close tabs on you but i
am warning you and if you win i lose

  the ferret raised his expressive eye-
brows

  thats mighty square of you mr
henderson he said and mighty nice
of you to take a chance on me sir he said
to the warden

  but he made no protestation of his de-
termination or ability to win the wardens
bet

  thats all rogers said the latter
rising good-by and good luck

  they shook hands warden and ex-convict
and the latter passed from the private office
quietly unobtrusive but unslinking and
presently went out of the gate of sorrow
and down to the train with the others who
had also shaken off the shackles of judg-
ment

  want to hedge henderson asked the
warden

  not me wait till he sees broadway
and a jane he wants and who wants a flash
you can book that bet

  and the warden booked it

it happened that henderson
got through with his penitentiary
business in time to take the same
train as the ferret whom he found in the
smoking-car being a sport henderson
known to all the trainmen did not help to
make the ferret conspicuous by even
nodding to him but he took a seat across the
aisle and a little back of his man lit one of
the wardens cigars and kept a casual but
keen eye on the ferret

  the ferret looked out of the window for
a while at the green meadows of west-
chester county at the green woodlands
the blue distance the nigh flowers the
birds at a butterfly that vagrantly fluttered


adventure

with the train for a few seconds and there
was a look in the eyes that would have
surprised henderson almost a suggestion
of the dew that might still be moist on the
ferns in the shady coppices then he
bought a paper from the news-butcher
a paper and an orange and glanced at one
long-forbidden luxury while he slowly
swallowed the other segment by segment
suddenly he sat up absorbed in an item

  henderson noticed the swift change
noticed the heading of the paper bought
one himself when the boy came through
again and read where the ferret was reading
for the second time there was no dewy
look in the ferrets eyes now only the hard
shine of gray steel and into hendersons
eyes crept a look of triumph

  what did i tell the warden said
henderson to himself whatd i tell him
what hes reading is like catnip to an old
tom hes sore he wasnft in on it his
mouths watering now ill bet wonder
if ill get on the case

  and he settled himself to read the item
with professional absorption

  there had been a week-end gathering
at the long island home of a wall street
successful broker whose wife affected the
close acquaintanceship of bohemia her
guests had many names famous in the four
arts plus the art of the theater and the
roof garden and there were others more
eccentric than famous a rollicking uncon-
ventional crew who had participated in a
fancy-dress dance starting in the house
transferred to the moonlit lantern-painted
lawn and winding up with an early break-
fast at the country club

  and the next morning the pearls of the
hostess were missing after many of the
guests had departed

  it was not a matter for the police
declared the hostess not yet at all events
they might have been taken in mistake
there had been necessarily a great con-
fusion in the leave-takings and donning of
wraps she hoped she expected they
would be returned followed a detailed
description of the necklace of matched
pearls with a sapphire clasp

  henderson bit savagely into the stub of
his cigar

  bah he told himself one of the
bohemiam bums hooked em lots of
em ud starve if it wasnt for a lot of crazy
women who want to entertain em ill

bet she suspects one of them right now
not a matter for the police rot if some
of those spangled poets and paint-daubers
was jugged once in a while it ud do em
all good i wonder-yes there it is

  he had turned over the sheets to the
advertising columns and there in the
personals he found what he expected

   reward and no questions asked for the
return of the pearl necklace owned by a certain
hostess and missed yesterday morning after a dance
apply to throop  towne jewelers new york
city

  curiously enough the ferret had also
turned to that column but now he was
reading the sporting page with zest ap-
parently his interest had ceased with the
fact that the job had been turned-and
turned by an amateur but henderson
still mentally spluttered

  - fool ad wrote it herself got

her husband to put up the five hundred
its a cinch she not only guesses who it was
and wants to cover them but she wants to
help em out of the mess that put them up
to the swipe maybe-

  his eyes narrowed as his mind wandered
down the devious and dirty alleys that his
profession sometimes led him to an
infatuated foolish woman a shrewd ad-
venturer the five hundred an acknowledg-
ment of attempted blackmail and an
implied willingness to meet it busy
husband and idle wife the old triangle
stuff it was old to henderson

  presently he too was deep in the possi-
bilities of war-time baseball but he kept
the ferret in view when the train got in
the ferret wandered along almost jauntily
an idler in new york he bought a
gardenia from a police-dodging vender
smelled it and set it in his lapel and
strolled on again the flower utterly re-
deeming the cheapness of his suit

  at fifth avenue he made his way to
the library steps and standing beside one
of the supercilious twin lions a woman met
him she was no taller than the ferret
and she was slender her clothes giving
her a youth that still lingered in her quick
impetuous rush matched by the ferrets
embrace henderson caught sight of a
carefully tinted face that yet did not avoid
the ferrets kiss of hair carefully made
golden and he smiled as he passed on he
the ferret and the bet



was through with the ferret for the present
but he felt reasonably sure of his bet he
even pondered as to how he should spend it

  a painted moll they all fall for
them he told himself

  he was looking at the only side he knew
the seamy one he did not guess that rouge
and powder and eyebrow-pencils that hide
the ravages of time are sometimes the
camouflage of love love that seeks to hold
and is a little afraid

  youre lookin fine jim who gave
you the gardenia

  i bought it for you nan lookin
great yourself lets get out of here
lets get a regular meal somewhere where
theres music and singing stuff and
dancing

  got any money jim

  seven dollars old girl enough for eats 
ive got nearly four hundred left jim
you wonder you aint been starving
yourself have you

  not me do i look it but i moved
to a smaller place

  good dope keep the bunch off for
a while

  she looked earnestly at him

  dont you want to see them jim
i saw flynn on the street he told me to
tell you he had something good that needed
you they was waiting for you to come
out he said

  did you tell him where you was living
no jim he told me where i could
find him

  good nan he took her arm im
going to cut out all that stuff

  jim you mean it

  her voice rang out so that people turned
to look at them the ferret nodded

  well talk it over later but ill tell
you this much im going into growing
fancy shrubs got it all doped out re-
member how i always could make things
grow remember the first garden we had
you was always good at it too nan-
brace up old girl heres the grill

  she winked back the happy tears that
welled and they turned into the grill

  looking at things dispassionately it
seemed as if the chances of winning lay
even between henderson and the warden
at that moment

  later that afternoon the ferret started
down-town to take the long island ferry
there was a famous arboriculturist whose

plantations and nurseries were located
there close to many of his customers and
the ferret who never allowed the grass
to grow under his feet intended to get his
prices and other information at first-hand
as well as look for a likely piece of land for
the leasing

  just how he was going to tackle the
problem of an independent nursery on the
three hundred-odd dollars that constituted
his and nans capital he could not figure
out but his consuming energy to get going
forced him to a start also at the arbori-
culturists he might hear of a job for
the warden had promised to give him ref-
erences that would not hold the taint of
his work having been done in the peni-
tentiary and to the ferret the warden
was a good deal of a surprise and somewhat
of a god a superman at least one who
never failed in his promises

when he walked aboard the ferry
and made his way forward to the
bows a red-headed pasty-faced
man spotted him and followed him the
ferret did not see the man for he walked
silently as a cat until the latter caught
him by the elbow and as the ferret swiftly
slewed his neck to look at him led the way
to the rail

  it was flynn flynn of his old crowd
flynn who found the plants and did the
scouting and preliminary investigation

  been looking for you jim said flynn
figured youd ring up some time to-
morrow i gave nan the number but
the sooner the better we been waiting
for you to get back where you bound
to look at a place on the island flynn
where you off to

  flynn grinned

  i got a date he said theres a flash
maid over at this plant were figuring on
you for and she and me is keeping com-
pany wheres this dump youre after
who put you wise to it tip from up
there eh

  youre a way off flynn said the
ferret im through

  through what

  im going straight flynn

  the-you are say whats the idea

you aint got converted to that billy sun-
day stuff have you

  figureit how you want to flynn im
through


adventure

  the other fell back and studied the
ferrets face inflexible with purpose then
he whistled softly

  youve gone balmy up there jim
youll come out of it after a while after
what you got salted is used up nan didnt
seem to be extra flush at that say jim
you aint in earnest are you listen this
plant is a cinch five thou apiece in it
easy dont be a mutt jim whats your
lay

  ill tell you what my lay is flynn
im sick of this hide-out game theres
nothing in it to offset what you lose i
want to be able to live in one place and
know its mine and it aint going to be
taken away from me and nan or me taken
away from it nan feels the same way
about it shes always wanted to be on
the level flynn and i guess shes got some-
thing coming to her after my trip up the
river

  lost your nerve up there sneered
flynn

  no said the ferret looking him
straight in the eyes i dont believe i have
flynn i hope not im going to need it
all but im through

  flynn shrugged his shoulders

  you know your own business best
he said anyway nans got my phone
number so long

  he turned away and the ferret lost him
when they took different trains he looked
out at the fields and gardens and the earth
seemed calling to him what he had told
nan was quite true things grew for him
he was a bom gardener a real craftsman
a vision of peace grew slowly of him with
his shrubs and nan with her flowers-
she always loved flowers-there were ger-
aniums struggling in the tiny apartment
he had just left but it would be a hard
road and he did not yet see the start
and then timed to his own pulse the wheels
seemed clacking out a rhythm that pres-
ently voiced itself persistently

  five - thou - apiece five - thousand -
easy

  to turn this one trick and then the way
would be clear he saw what he could do
with that land a house tools young
plants in the upturned soil   

  he swept the thoughts from his brain
and sat frowning until his station was
reached

  the big grower was cordial and sympa-

thetic but the ferret was soon convinced
how utterly impracticable was his plan
with war-prices and war-payments he
would have to spend all his scanty hundreds
for fertilizer alone the grower offered
him a certain credit for plants when he was
once established but where was the rent to
come from for the land the dwelling the
living-expenses

  you say you can get recommendations
said the grower i can place you in a job
good salary i wouldnt wonder if they
could find a place for your wife if shes
handy no kids you say

  no said the ferret slowly no kids

  well i know they are having a hard time
with their help it isnt far from here
mr rogers you can tell them i sent you
up they are a bit upset at this time
had a robbery night before last but i
dare say mrs haskinsll see you

  the ferret listened to the directions and
started for the haskins place it would
be the best thing to do for the present
especially if nan got on and that should
be easy for nan was more than just
handy she had been a maid when he first
met her much as flynn was going to meet
the girl he mentioned but there was a
peculiar irony in it all he and nan ex-
con and ex-cons wife applying for a job in a
place where a pearl necklace had been
stolen for this was the mrs haskins of
the news item it was risky

  if he was ever tipped off of course he had
an alibi as to the necklace no one could
accuse a man of robbery who was in jail
when it occurred but every place was
risky in a way and since he had no capital
he could not turn down the first chance
the warden would manage his credentials
the warden did not believe in showing the
seamy side of a man who was trying to
make good he would only say that he
recommended the pattern

  mrs haskins is somewhere in the
garden the maid told him and if he had
come about a gardeners position he might
as well see her there

  so the ferret trod the walks between
trim lawns and flower-beds through a rose
garden and so down as directed by a man
who was handling watering-hose to a
terrace backed by a yew hedge high as the
ferrets head

  he walked along the hedge toward the
gap of its entrance on to the terrace
the ferret and the bet

i

screened himself by masses of shrubbery
and his trained ears caught the syllables
of earnest talk and from a nature not yet
subdued listened with the habit of his
recent profession

  so when i saw the news in the paper
this morning helen i made up my mind
to come over and see what could be done
i got up late but i came as soon as i could
im terribly sorry about it

  now the ferret had learned to read men
in many ways by looks by apparently
trivial actions and by the intonations of
the voice this voice sounded frank sym-
pathetic as it was cultured but there was
a purring quality to it that made the
ferret distrust its owner before he saw him
and feel sure that his suspicion was well
placed it was the voice of a man accus-
tomed to talk much with women-a voice
that could flatter readily and did-that
could charm and woo the voice of a stage-
lover

  the womans voice was harder to inter-
pret it held a hint of fear a hint of in-
sincerity or of fence but it was charming
and the ferret rooted suddenly still
listened

  did you see the reward i offered
clinton harry was very kind about it
he offered to make it more but i thought
it was enough and i want my pearls
back clinton i love them the money
does not matter so much but they were
harrys wedding-gift to me and i want
them

  the insincerity or whatever it was left
the voice as she spoke of her desire for the
gems then it came back

  can you suggest anything clinton

  i cant im a dub at such things i
suppose you might double the reward if you
dont get any response the necklace is
worth much more

  it cost ten thousand dollars but-
whoever took it-would not be easily able
to dispose of it harry says mr throop
the jeweler told him that the pearls would
lose value immediately they were separated
or sold unmatched and of course the full
description was in the paper

  yes but i think i should double that
reward tomorrow

  the ferret did not shift his position but
his eyes hardened and his fists clenched

  clinton went on the woman do
you remember you promised to return to

me those two letters i sent you they did
not mean anything they were just foolish
letters but harry-wont you let me have
them

  i will tomorrow belle if there is
nothing else i can do ill be getting back
on the  that is if youre not going
to ask me to stay to dinner

  he laughed as he spoke

  no it isnt convenient tonight clin-
ton

  if i were you id telephone to those
jeweler people and also to the paper
doubling that reward i think it will bring
results you say your husband was willing
to increase it and ill send you those-
foolish-letters you speak of

  the ferret looked at his cheap but com-
petent watch it was  and the station
was a full mile back he intended to catch
the  the job-could wait the man
and the woman moved on doubtless they
were going back to the house the ferret
ambuscaded behind the shrubs glimpsed the
graceful figure and pretty face of the woman
and paid especial attention to the man a
handsome somewhat haggard chap fault-
lessly dressed who passed on with a covert
smile as he passed out of sight

  within a hundred yards of the station
a car sped by the hurrying ferret and in it
sat the man whose first name was clinton
he got out at the station and the car re-
turned toward the haskins place

  up-town and later the man whose first
name was clinton descended from the
elevated in the nineties and walked to the
door of a bachelor-apartment house which
he opened with a key he entered a
minute later the ferret inspected the small
foyer and noted a card that read

clinton howard bowdin apt 

  he looked at the rest of the names
apparently comparing them with an en-
velop he carried frowned and crossed the
street seemingly looking at numbers

  but he glanced back at the house he had
left quite casually it was dark and
some of the windows were already illumin-
ated

  apartment eight mused the ferret
that should be on the top floor back
seven is in front no one home there

  he walked up the street and back again
slowly three doors from the house that


adventure

clinton bowdin had entered was one
evidently vacant-to let signs in its
windows

nan greeted the ferret expec-
tantly supper was ready for him
the first home meal jim she
said any news or do you want to
keep it until after supper

  no news old girl he said but
prospects and i have to go out after
supper	

  she did not question him but after he
had gone she went into the bedroom where
he had been rummaging in a closet and
herself reached down a box on the back of
the shelf hardly knowing she carried it
she bore it into the next room and sat down
heavily with the box on her lap her face
was old now old and pinched between the
lines and gray

  he has taken his keys and his gun
she repeated to herself over and over as
she rocked her face a mask of dread-
dread and sorrow

bthe ferret entered the doorway of
the vacant house like a shadow and
deftly set in the lock a twisted piece
of tempered wire a little pull a pause a
quick thrust and a turn and the lock slid
the shadowed door opened and closed again

  two minutes later the scuttle leading
to the roof lifted and the ferret emerged
keeping well back from the front coping and
making his swift and subtle progress over
the roofs he tried the scuttle-hatch of
the house that stood the third below and
found it tightly fastened from within
hardly visible in the gloom he glided to the
back of the roof peered over tested a gutter
let himself down with the agility of a gym-
nast swinging to his hands and dropped
without noise on to the top landing of a
fire-escape

  the landing was outside a room before
whose window a blind was drawn almost
to the bottom all but an inch the ferret
bent-looked through

  handsome clinton bowdin was seated at
a table gazing at a lustrous string of pearls
clasped by a sapphire

  wondering if shes doubled that re-
ward the ferret told himself hes
figuring on getting up early tomorrow to
see that paper but he cant cash in until
the jeweler opens

  he stood upright struck silently a safety-
match showing the barest glimmer through
his shielding fingers while he briefly sur-
veyed the latch of the window with the
precision of an expert he inserted something
between the sashes upward gave a twist
to the handle of the instrument and the
catch was sprung with the tiniest of clicks
within bowdin did not move

  the ferret nosed the breeze almost
imperceptible tried its strength with a wet
finger and then a loosely held bit of paper

  he eased up the bottom sash with the
tool that had started the catch and inch
by inch under his wide-spread fingers
quick to sense any lack of balance the lower
pane moved upward back of the blind

  bowdin put back the necklace into its
case and took up two letters that he read
through with a sneering smile

  cheap at the price he said the
little fool to- hell

  he jumped to his feet as the spring blind
rushed up and flapped about its roller
coming through the window was a slight
man of whose face nothing could be seen
but a resolute chin and two eyes hard as
steel showing through a mask one re-
markably steady hand held an automatic
aimed for bowdins heart

  bowdin did not move

  ill put up my hands if you want me
to he said but youve come to the
wrong apartment i am broke my mur-
derous friend always perennially broke
nothing worth your while shooting for
besides the house is full some one might
hear the shot

  you wouldnt said the ferret youd
see the flash and feel the smash of the bullet
and that would be the end of you ill look
out for myself afterward but ill shoot

  bowdin turned pale sweat broke out on
his forehead and the fingers of his hand
on the table trembled the brutal de-
scription and the tone that backed it had
broken his bravado

  what do you want he said in a low voice

  the necklace you were admiring dont
move

  he shoved the automatic forward so that
its grim muzzle brushed the serge of
bowdins coat and picked up the case
with one hand sliding it into his own
pocket then he took up the letters

  what do you want those for they
are private letters
the ferret and the bet



  same thing you wanted them for now
mr bowdin dont start anything after i go
im going out the front way it might be
awkward for you to explain how you got
that necklace get me

  he deftly ran his hand over bowdin in a
search for a weapon

  now then he said you climb out
that window on to the fire-escape go on
with a glance of furious but futile resent-
ment bowdin obeyed

  you can break the glass after a while if
you cant open the sash like i did or you
can climb down and stir up the janitor
good night

  he pulled down the pane and set the
catch leaving the discomfited bowdin
glaring at him through the glass went down
the stairs opened the front door-latch and
passed into the street confident that he
would not be followed

  nan looked up with a white face and red-
rimmed eyes as he entered and tossed the
jewelers case into her lap

  jim she said jim you said-

  nan theres a reward of one thousand
hung up for this and no questions asked
i fell on to it the thousand means every-
thing to us just now i turned down
flynns job though there was five times the
amount in it the people who put up this
reward wont miss a thousand as much as we
would ten cents a cheap thief swiped it and
i took it from the thief i took something
else from him two letters a woman would
give the thousand for without a murmur
you said youd go straight jim i was
so happy till i saw what youd taken from
the box

  well chuck them all in the river to-
morrow nan after i get the thousand
but its stealing jim stealing and
blackmail

  where do you get that i aint selling
the letters i aint read em and i aint
going to im sending em back i didnt
take the necklace luck chucked it my
way when i most needed it and im going
to get that thousand

  his face was dogged

  jim its just the same you didnt earn
the thousand

 the- i didnt

  jim ill put it to you this way maybe
i dont put it well but i know it aint
straight which way would the warden
look at it

  the ferret flushed he sat down with a
straight line between his brows then he
laughed

  the warden if the warden knew hed
figure hed lost his bet i reckon

  hows that jim

  and he told her of the wager

      throop senior partner of throop
 towne fifth avenue jewelers
looked in perplexity at the slight
gray-headed man who sat opposite him in
his private office between them the
haskins necklace lay on the leather-topped
desk like a coiling snake

  you say you dont want any reward
he asked but the money is here i give
you my word the matter goes no further
the ferret shook his head

  wont you leave your name-con-
fidentially this is most extraordinary
do you realize the necklace is worth ten
thousand dollars

  yes i realize that mr throop but
you are breaking the compact

  what compact

  no questions asked good morning

sir

  outside the store the ferret dropped a
letter in a mail-box it was addressed to
mrs belle haskins of long island and
marked personal as he turned away
some one tapped him on the shoulder and
he whirled

  hello ferret said henderson what
are you doing in throop  townes
pricing diamonds with mr throop
said the ferret if you dont believe me
ask him

  henderson looked at him with a half-
grin

  youre a foxy one ferret but ive got
my eye on you im going to collect that

bet

  will you do me a favor mr hen-
derson

  what is it

  just how much did you bet with the
warden about me

  the detective looked at him quizzically
a century why want to pay it for
the warden

  i might im going up to see him this
afternoon

  he walked off leaving henderson looking
after him in a muddle of speculation
presently the detective shadowed him


adventure

the ferret perfectly conscious of the opera-
tion and when henderson flashing his
badge asked his question at the ticket
office the puzzle on his face deepened at
the answer

  ossining round trip

  in the train the ferret skinned off his
roll five twenties he put in his vest
pocket the balance a little over two hun-
dred and seventy dollars he returned to
his hip

yill tell you what i think of it
rogers said the warden as he
handed the ferret a cigar i
should like to meet that wife of yours
i wish youd arrange it

why of course im proud to sir
for one thing i want to ask her if she
considers ive lost this bet to henderson
because im not at all sure about it myself
rogers and her vision is rather wonderful

so you had better keep the hundred till we
talk it over ive been thinking about you
rogers how would you like to have me
as a business partner

 why-why

  the ferret gasped and choked

  ive got a thousand or so i could invest
in say the fancy shrub business rogers
like to go into it

  youd trust me

  id trust you and that wife of yours
together anywhere rogers youve won
your own best bet

  in the eyes of the ferret riding through
westchester county in the early evening
was a look that might have suggested the
dew on the ferns in the shady coppices that
graced the verdant hills and a vision
came again to stay a vision of upturned
earth and the balm of shrubs of fragrant
flowers and tending them himself and
nan

blighty

by talbot mundy

mhe derivation of blighty is as
simple really as the origin and
meaning of theodore roose-
velts nickname given him by
the natives of east africa in spite of the
fifty various explanations given in the
papers tumbo means stomach neither
more nor less and blighty means eng-
land it is one of tommys adaptations
from hindustani-a language he twists
and changes to suit himself when in india
and when time-expired brings home in
fragments with which to adulterate the
ever-growing english language

  originally the word is vilayli which
means european but since the only sec-
tion of europe and the only europeans
with whom the vast majority of natives
ever come in contact are england and
the british by inference the word lias
come to mean british almost whenever
used vilayli pani-european water-
soda water so much for the native stand-
point

  adapting that tommy gets blighty

tobacco as distinguished from the local
article blighty clothing blighty letters
blighty leave and-last of all-he goes
blighty when the troopship takes him
home so blighty is england and to
wish you a blighty one is to hope that
when you are wounded it will be a severe
enough case to take you to england with-
out sending you west

  the daily swelling war vocabulary is full
of similar instances rooty for the
bread ration is simply hindustanee roli-
bread treck meaning to move in any
way on wheels is the boer word trek-
travel to keep a dekko lifting mean-
ing to keep a sharp lookout is from the
hindustani imperative dekko-look

  before ever he napooed a man tommy
in the old days would nayhai him and that is
from the hindustani ne hoi meaning is
not of all the other scores and scores of
words that tommy has brought home from
indian campaigns perhaps the oftenest
used is go arsty for go slow-simply the
hindustani word ahsti-softly gently

hy boy  churchill

author of the welding a shift into reverse

wtwhome recruiting officer anxious
to fill out a draft wished single-
 ton smith on to the service

	  he was healthy cornless with
a mouth full of teeth and may have looked
like good raw material but as a flat-foot
he was a flat failure he wouldnt drill he
wouldnt work he wouldnt mix and worst
of all he wouldnt keep himself clean

  hes a plain bum said slim higgins
one of the kind that knocks at back doors
and leaves a tomato-can on a fence-post
when he crosses a creek about as much
chance to make a sailorman of him as to
beat the boatswain cussin when theres a
foul anchor

  slim higgins and dick reasoner sat on
their respective ditty-boxes smoking black
cuddy pipes and discussed this new puzzle
to the training-ship dixie it was wednes-
day afternoon rope-yarn sunday with drill
over smoking lamp lighted and nothing
to do until supper

  uhuh answered slims companion
but you overlooked one point

  shoot it then said slim itll be
the only thing that anybody noticed if its
anything good this guy thinks that water
is the root of all evil

  well said the other shifting his pipe
over he enlisted didnt he had to vol-
unteer to do it what made him join if
there wasnt some good in him

  needed a meal-ticket scoffed higgins
maybe so but i have looked him up
here he is right here

carefully reasoner pulled from his blouse

a small well-thumbed dictionary and turn-
ing to a page put his blunt brown finger
on a word his shipmate watched him
without amusement

  listen-to-reason reasoners well-
known pet hobby was sacred and had a way
of working out most unexpectedly

  upheaval he read a lifting from
below a lifting of strata by some internal
force

  whats strata asked slim sounds
like a japanese cuss-word

  reasoner turned the pages swiftly

  ive looked it up but forget it he
apologized here she is an artificial
layer

  youve hit it said higgins its a
layer of dirt but just to be a sport ill
bet you a new hand-sewed white hat that
hobo smith if he is an upheaval gets
upheaved over the side before he makes a
sailorman there goes the mess call you
can work on these hopeless specimens all
you want to but me im findin it hard
enough to punch a little sense into the likely
ones

  the dixie had just cleared hampton
roads for a six-months training cruise
smith with ten others had come aboard at
the last moment without the usual stay at
the receiving-ship he was labeled lands-
man for detail which meant that his duty
was anything from cooks striker to passing
coal

  the first morning at inspection the divi-
sion officer pounced on smith his uniform
new stiff and ill-fitting was terribly dirty


	adventure

he had been peeling spuds for the cook
and had not changed

  you look like a hobo cried lieutenant
thorne

  for the good of the division it was well
to make an example in the beginning and
smith afforded a glaring opportunity

  what do you mean coming to quarters
looking as if you had just crawled from
under a freight-train go to the barber and
get that shag of hair cut go to your bag
and get a clean uniform go get some
water and wash your face

  yes sir humbly answered smith mak-
ing a ragged salute without embarrass-
ment though all his shipmates were grin-
ning at the bawling out what then

  go to the devil laughed the lieutenant
insolently

  hobo shuffled off without a sign of re-
sentment he had been named he was
a yellow cur as well his shoulders drooped
his feet dragged if he had owned a tail
it would have been between his legs

  a week in the galley and the cook com-
plained

  i cant stand the smell of him around
the place he growled to the first lieutenant
ive threatened to take the butcher-knife
to him put lye in his soup scald him it
all does no good he gets dirtier and dirt-
ier even when were cooking onions i
get him strong when hes to windward

  the first lieutenant took one look at
smith and transferred him to the deck
force

  see what you can do with him mr
thorne was his instruction and that
officer put hobo smith up to dick rea-
soner

  on a training-ship there are many diffi-
cult problems men of varied tempera-
ment and training are to be fitted in ad-
justed molded into a compact working
unit of force where before they had been
individuals each with a more or less
pampered ego some must learn obedi-
ence unselfishness the curbing of self
others must throw off timidity expand
into men become assertive of their rights

  for this task the officers and men of a
training-ship are carefully picked slim
higgins was a master at signals henry
cowles knew knots and splicing jimmy
wade handled the boats and so on down
the list each petty officer and seaman a
specialist in his line

  dick reasoner was known on more ships
than the dixie with his appeal to the
dictionary he had helped out many a man
now serving in his proper place happy and
contented who had started on the quick
downward road which leads to the stone
frigate and a bobtail discharge hence the
men called him dictionary dick but
had a profound respect for his advice and
sought his help in trouble

  reasoners peculiar talent ran to men
he knew them studied them loved them
on other ships where the saying was
tell your troubles to the marines on
the dixie it was tell your troubles to dic-
tionary dick he was large slow-mov-
ing older-looking than his thirty-five years
with quick sympathetic eyes and heavy
angular features not a good-looking man
but strong-jawed patient cool just the
sort of man who makes a judge in civil life
and a master-at-arms in the navy rea-
soncr was an ex-apprentice and had served
since he was eighteen he was the official
smoother-out of tangles the last appeal in
difficult cases one who led much and drove
little

  lieutenant thorne smiled a little as he
told the master-at-arms to take charge of
hobo smith reasoner smiled in return

  do what you want to with him said
the lieutenant i believe the captain
wouldnt grumble if you shot him at sun-
rise or pushed him overboard some dark
night that would be about all i could
think of perhaps you may find a way to
deal with him out of the dictionary

  the lieutenant smiled some more but
reasoner did not

  everything is in the book he said sim-
ply maybe theres a cure for smith

       the crew wondered what course
       reasoner would take in an effort to

  fiy make a change in hobo and did not
lave long to wait at first came a short
interview

  whats your name he asked

  he spoke with the same drawl that his
height and his slow manner indicated but
with a certain alertness in his eyes which
those few who lied to him knew meant an
intent keen perception before which pre-
tense always failed

  hobo smith said the other shame-
lessly

  between us from now on it will be your
arab



real name said reasoner your name
is singleton smith its a good name
somebody gave it to you who had high hopes
of your being an honor to it you gave it
when you swore to follow the rules of the
navy thats all the lecture im going
to make a valet out of you singleton
youre going to valet yourself thats one
thing the service insists on

  every man here that is fit to associate
with other men scrubs his body and his
clothes ive roped off a little space up
there in the manger you will take your
bag hammock ditty-box and yourself there
and stay there if anybody speaks to you
ill put them on the report your business
is to watch the other men and scrub your-
self and clothes any morning you fail to
do it you fail to eat

  you put it to him strong said slim
higgins whats the idea if he had a
spark of manhood in him as big as the
point of a sail-needle hed a climbed your
frame

  isolation said reasoner every-
thing else has been tried if it brings about
reflection it may let him get the best of
this upheaval of strata from beneath

  too deep for me sighed higgins
beanin him with a marline-spike is more
to my notion

  the novelty of having a man confined
on the forecastle to whom they were not to
speak nor communicate with in any way
soon wore off the crew hobo smith be-
came as much a part of the deck gear as
the bitts or chains men remembered not
to speak to him and then formed the habit
and forgot to speak

  when the cook came with the food he
whistled and then shoved the plate toward
smith with his foot under reasoners di-
rection he rigged up his own lines for scrub
and wash clothes and still under reason-
ers directions he washed and scrubbed
at the end of a week ills outfit was fairly
clean

  then reasoner did not show up for two
mornings hobo scrubbed the first day
and shirked the next on the third day at
reasoners appearance hobo had made no
start toward washing while all around him
the men were bathing ancf preparing to
scrub their clothes

  reasoner was not impatient

  i hate to keep a man penned up like a
dog he said and so i let you have a

chance you could have joined the divi-
sion singleton but i guess a man takes a
long time to break a bad habit

  without being told hobo took his bucket
and went for water for his scrubbing true
to his word reasoner had the cook take
only water to the prisoner that day

  another week and the ship was in port
and the men going ashore on liberty the
whole forward divisions held hobo smith
in open contempt they referred to him
as the life-termer but knew that once a
home port was reached he would be dis-
charged as undesirable none of this
seemed to reach smith in his pen for-
ward he was carelessly indifferent and his
only real discomfort was the daily scrub-
bing under the eye of reasoner then
reasoner went ashore for a day and
found that smith had missed the scrubbing
again

  the man seems to have no sense of
honor said lieutenant thorne to the first
lieutenant reasoner seems to have
failed in his cure this time

  he is at least keeping him from infect-
ing the ship said the first lieutenant
why not have a marine watch him when
reasoner is away

  at the next port when reasoner went
ashore lieutenant thorne asked for the
marine sentry and hobo smith found him-
self under the eyes of another master with
reasoner there had grown up a little morn-
ing routine which never varied it had
been good morning singleton and
from a sullen silence smith had begun to
say good morning never had there
been except on the first morning any other
order to begin work smith had com-
menced as soon as reasoner appeared

  get busy you scum ordered the sen-
try

  smith looked the marine over and did
not answer

  work or you dont eat taunted the
sentry

  but smith sat down on the deck with
his back to the other and refused to scrub
that day he had only water

  reasoner was pleased when he returned

  its a hopeful sign he said to slim
higgins the word is defiance its a
thirty-third cousin to self-respect if a
man has it he may have better qualities

  let us hope so said slim but billy-
goats are long on that defiance stuff too


adventure

  dick reasoner knew that he could not
keep smith confined in his little pen for an
indefinite time he interfered in some
measure with the freedom of the already-
crowded forecastle and unless he could
show results some other method of dealing
with the man would have to be tried the
way came unexpectedly

  ashore again seeing the sights with his
friend slim higgins a poor half-starved
puppy wandering drunkenly on its weak
legs across the pavement was shoved off
into the gutter by a careless foot which
had just missed stepping on it the little
dog whined pleadingly with its front paws
on the curb as it tried vainly to drag itself
back

  slim higgins went on by but reasoner
stopped

  looks like hes homeless he said in-
dicating the dog which redoubled its puny
efforts to climb to the sidewalk as it saw
some one had noticed it

  come on said slim id think you
had enough pets on your hands with that
hobo on the ship

  but reasoner had extended a big hand
and helped the puppy back to firmer foot-
ing

  im going to take him along he an-
nounced hell get run over and killed
anyway

  buying a newspaper he wrapped the
dirty little dog in it carried him out to the
ship fed and washed him and took liim
for an airing near where hobo smith sat
and looked idly out to sea smith had
failed to scrub again and was doing an-
other water only day

  hello singleton greeted reasoner
and sat down on a chest where he could
watch developments

  howdy answered smith obediently
his eyes following the wandering puppy
whose dog he asked snapping his fin-
gers to the playful little waif

  i found him looking for a home said
reasoner and so i brought him along
the first lieutenant has given permission
to have him in the first division ive
named him a-rab which the book says is a
homeless outcast

  airedale said smith oughter make
a fine dog

  smith was showing more interest than
at any time since he had been on board
the little dog had climbed into his lap

reasoners plans crystallized
instantly

  you can keep him up here with
you he said youve made friends
mighty quick let him share your rations
until he gets bigger reasoner got up as
if the matter was settled singleton he
said after this week you go to regular
duty

  smith knew from the tone what he
meant he was to have a chance to make
good and the dog was the prize smith
loved dogs he had a queer influence over
them back during the old days on the
road he walked fearlessly up to the most
savage ones and made friends something
deep in him that was almost dead came
feebly to life he smiled at reasoner with
his hand still stroking the sleeping puppy

  thanks he said youre a good old
scout

  smith took his place in the division
humbly the first morning at inspection
lieutenant thorne had him step from ranks
and turn round

  get a better fit next time he said for
smiths uniform was clean and his shoes
shined and there was no fault to find

  but smiths place was not an easy one
he was behind on the drills slow at his
work looked down upon by his shipmates
the only thing that he did do well was to
scrub clothes and look after arab the aire-
dale puppy who had begun to put on the
shaggy coat of his breed

  that pups got sense confided slim
higgins to reasoner the little microbe
knows whos a friend to his master and
who is not you let me go within a yard
of him and he backs off and growls but he
lets you handle him most as easy as smith

  pets are popular on a ship and the men
soon found that to win the dogs favor they
must speak civilly to his master and hobo
smith made a few friends while he stead-
ily improved in his work but when he
drew up a ditty-box on a wednesday after-
noon to a group playing cards he was
never asked to take a hand no one shared
their tobacco with him if he ran out of
soap before the monthly small stores were
issued he could only borrow from rea-
soner

  in the groups that went ashore he trav-
eled alone so far as human company was
concerned but accompanied always by his
dog as time went on and arab grew
arab



rangy and long-legged smith kept with
him more and more and began to seek less
and less to establish a place for himself
with the crew

  reasoner had it out with him many
times

  what you want to do is to get a trans-
fer to some other ship this bunch here
sized you up wrong in the beginning and
they cant see that youve changed son
theres a word for you here in the book
thatll tell the whole story its forfend
it means to ward off by getting away
youll escape all this criticism of what you
used to be

  maybe youre right said smith id
like to get away from this bunch but
theres the dog if i go arab will have to
stay on hes mine but another ship
might make me give him up i can stand
most anything for arab and the dog
beat a tattoo on the deck with his tail in
answer

  one of smiths most persistent enemies
on the ship was engle a huge recruit coal-
passer he systematically nagged and
goaded both smith and his dog smearing
up smiths paint work with his greasy
hands and lacking at arab whenever the
occasion offered his hobby was shark
fishing and most every hour off watch he
was in the forecastle with a line off the side
he had found out from the complaints of
the others just the part of the ship that it
was smiths duty to scrub and usually
took his station there

  smith and his dog were playing tag the
next morning when engle came forward
they drew aside to let him pass the coal-
passer had been unable to secure bait at
the galley and a brilliant scheme to settle
two scores came to him as he saw the dog
without a word he stepped quickly for-
ward and grasped the puppy by the neck

  let him be youll hurt him resented
hobo smith angrily

  shut up you bum retorted engle
im going to make shark bait of this pup

  the dog hung snarling and twisting from
his hand trying vainly to get a hold with
his teeth

  let him go cried smith and made a
dive for the dog

  engle much larger and stronger than
smith let him come on until he was in
close and then holding the dog out of
reach sent his fist crashing into hobos

face who in his anxiety over the dog had
not tried to guard himself the blow
knocked him backward over a ditty-box
and he did not get up not until then did
the dog whine and redouble its efforts to
bite the hand that held it

  holding the squirming puppy between his
knees engle lashed it firmly to the big
shark hook and going out on the boat-
boom threw his line overboard half a
dozen men yelled to the big coal-passer to
haul the dog back aboard arab had made
some friends and after they were sure that
engle was not joking they made protest
but engle defied them

  dogs no good anyhow he said and
the first fellow that tries to do anything
ill knock him off the boom to help feed the
sharks

  as the men hung back reasoner came
running forward the little dog was swim-
ming valiantly with the heavy hook but
looked about spent instead of shouting
to engle reasoner climbed out on the
boom

  shame on you he cried haul that

pup in

  engle did not intend to back down in the
face of those watching so he took the fish-
line in the hand that held to the booms
supporting stay and faced reasoner de-
fiantly

  while all eyes were centered on reasoner
and engle no attention was paid to hobo
smith he crawled dizzily to his feet saw
what was going on lurched to the rail and
leaped overboard to the rescue of his pet

  engle was the larger of the two men on
the boom and had the advantage of posi-
tion because he held to the stay which
came down at an angle of forty-five degrees
from the ships side to the end of the boom
he could reach it for support while rea-
soner could not who had only the slack
life-line as reasoner advanced engle saw
an opportunity and untied the life-line
from the stay hoping to throw his antago-
nist off by swaying it sidewise but reasoner
cut the line behind him and threw it aside
coming at engle without support balanc-
ing on the narrow spar

  he had lost the slowness which charac-
terized his usual manner his loose body
was tense catlike and every movement
quick and sure foot by foot he advanced
on the coal-passer engle tied the fish-line
to the stay so that he could have both


adventure

hands and shook the boom in a final effort
to throw reasoner off

  haul in ordered reasoner who had
reached striking distance

  engles answer was to take a firmer grip
of the stay and kick out with both feet

  reasoner dodged backward balancing
himself on the shaking boom and acted on
the suggestion that engle had given be-
fore the coal-passer could quite recover
reasoner had rushed and instead of strik-
ing him and both men going overboard he
leaped into the air and caught the stay well
over engles head then hanging from his
hands he kicked the other man off the boom
not until then did the master-at-arms see
that hobo smith had reached the dog cut
the fish-line with his knife and with arab
resting on his shoulder had made the gang-
way and was climbing out of the water

  the assembled ships company had seen
the whole affair and from it they knew that
hobo smith would fight anybody and dare
most anything to save his dog and that
dick reasoner would back him up engle
swam to the gangway climbed up and went
below he had a bump on his cheek the
size of an egg where one of reasoners shoes
had landed

  from then on hobo smith had more as-
surance the men treated him with more
respect he had been licked of course but
he had shown fight against a larger man

the next morning at the deck
court engle was given five days
bread and water for punishment
the first lieutenant had arrived on the
scene in time to see the wind-up and a full
explanation had to be given by reasoner
this was the beginning of bad times for
engle a few weeks later he picked a quar-
rel with a fireman while on watch struck
the man over the head with a shovel and
was given a summary court-martial with
three months loss of pay and thirty days
confinement

  that dog of yours is to blame whis-
pered engle to smith when i get out of
here im going to poison him

  and smith his newly-found manhood
sitting uncertainly on his soul while he
fought the prejudice of the crew and all
his heart wrapped up in the beloved arab
believed the threat

  the fireman that engle had struck did
not do well in the hospital he took a sud-

den change for the worse engles case be-
came more serious his thirty days up he
was still confined if the man died he
would be held for murder again he found
a chance and whispered to smith

  help me to get away or ill kill the
dog

  just how he intended to do it while con-
fined in the brig he did not explain but
smith was interested only in arabs safety
he asked no questions the big coal-passer
would find a way and the dog now almost
full grown was growing more precious to
him each day

  the next day as engle passed he re-
peated his warning and smith asked-

  how

  during the next few days engle outlined
a plan the two could only speak a few
words as the prisoner passed forward for
his morning exercise but at the end of the
week engle was gone the master-at-arms
had locked him in after giving him his sup-
per and the marine sentry coming on
watch at eight oclock had found the brig
empty the ship was searched from stem
to stern but the prisoner could not be
found which was not surprising since the
steam launch had made a regular trip at
seven

  the first lieutenant summoned reasoner

  this is a serious matter master-at-
arms i have just had a report from the
hospital that rileys condition is critical
and here we let this coal-passer get away
there is rank carelessness somewhere and
the man to blame can expect no mercy from
me

  aye aye sir said reasoner i was
the master-at-arms on watch i am sure
that i locked engle in safely

  and he was gone when the sentries were
changed at eight he got away soon after
you were supposed to have locked him in
some time between supper and eight bells
i have no accusation to make as yet rea-
soner you have been a splendid petty offi-
cer and no doubt can explain everything
satisfactorily but engle could not get away
unless some one was careless and he dis-
appeared on your watch

  the prisoners disappearance made a
stir on the ship the mystery of it appealed
to the men and the fact that dictionary
dick was apt to get into trouble over it in-
terested all his friends

  didnt you tell me that you lost the key

m
arab

i

to the brig the other day asked slim hig-
gins

  i found it in my other trousers said
reasoner

  well whats your guess asked slim
the talk thats driftin forward from the
ward-room is that the first luff is goin to
disrate you

  reasoner looked at his friend steadily for
a moment

  slim he said i know that i turned
the key on that door and then shook it just
as i have been doing for a good many years
i dont know how engle got away but ive
dug out a good word from the book and i
intend to sit quiet a little before i do any-
thing

  whats the word if i was in your fix
id be pouncin on every theory i could
think of like a gull on a table scrap

  appendix which means something
added

  i get you said slim who had a per-
sonal knowledge of the word something
more to come out

  hobo smith came to reasoner that eve-
ning arab trotted happily at his heels
and greeted reasoner as a friend and com-
rade of his master smith lacked the dogs
freedom of manner he came with hesita-
tion more timid than he had been for
weeks he had something on his mind
which his new outlook on life would not
permit him to sit quiet under and so in
his own way he came to make amends

  they are talking about disrating you
because engle got away he said

  yes said reasoner stroking the dogs
head

  youve been a good friend to arab and
me said smith the words coming faster
as he went along engle wouldnt have
been in trouble if you hadnt saved arab
he wouldnt have been in the brig nor had
the scrap with the fireman

  what are you driving at interrupted
reasoner

  its our fault that trouble has come to
you said smith i wonder if the cap-
tain would let me have arab in the brig if
i said i let engle out that would clear
you and i wouldnt mind it so much with
arab

  no said reasoner you couldnt keep
the dog in the brig but what made you
offer to do this thing for me

  smith went on

  i wouldnt have arab if it wasnt for
you i dont amount to much anyway i
thought maybe you would let me do this to
pay back a little

  he was telling the things he longed to
do yet did not have the courage to carry
out for he knew that dictionary dick
would not let him make the sacrifice
reasoner was touched

  get out of here he said i thank
you and arab but it cant be done the
real explanation will show up

  but smith was unhappy a conscience
which he had forgotten he owned nagged
him the next day he went ashore and
did not return with the liberty party

  now smiths gone said the first lieu-
tenant i tell you reasoner you are too
easy on these fellows it takes more than
being good to them to make sailormen i
want to confer with the captain before i
act but unless you can furnish some good
explanation for engles walking out of the
brig well probably disrate you

hobo smith had gone ashore
without a plan always a child of
chance he thought that engle might
providentially show up just what he
would do even then was not quite clear in
his mind he was undergoing the greatest
trial of his life taught to five for himself
alone and to consider nothing worth while
that concerned others his experience on
board the dixie had almost made him over
but he was still in the transitory stage and
had not emerged fully into his new life
his big purpose in coming ashore was to
fight out this battle with liimself

  as he walked along arab trotting so-
berly at his heels as if he understood the
struggle his master was having smith fi-
nally made a decision reasoner had been
too good to him he would go back and
square things up and take the punishment
at least arab had been saved from engle
and he knew that reasoner would lake
good care of the dog until he was free again

  the resolution made smith start briskly
for the landing he had just time to make
the boat and return on time arab sensing
the change in his masters spirits ran ahead
of him gayly suddenly he stopped the
bristles on his spine rose and his jaws
turned back from his rows of well-formed
teeth he faced across the sidewalk and
there walking calmly down the other side


adventure

in civilian clothes was engle smith would
have passed him without recognition but
the dog had picked out the hate smell and
knew his enemy in any garb

  keep back smith warned the dog
and then they turned to follow engle

  the big coal-passer saw them and turned
into a narrow alley before they had followed
a block smith now had a plan he would
follow engle until he could find a police-
man and then have him arrested he fully
expected the man to run from him back
in the old days when he dodged and evaded
that would have been his own course

  but engle seeing no help in sight turned
back to meet him and smith had a moment
of panic tempted to take to his heels his
dog saved him arab was the wrong breed
to run from danger he advanced giving
signs of a battle and smith followed

  what do you want asked engle
call that dog off and beat it about your
business or ill kick both your ribs in

  youre going back to the ship with us
said smith trying to put a little of the brave
menace of arabs growls into his voice

  well of all the nerve laughed engle
scat the two of you before my mind
changes

  but arab had charged engles tone
and the wave of his hand had been challenge
enough straight for the throat he leaped
a tawny streak of fury engle struck
out with both hands dodging sideways
and the dog missed one of the coal-
passers big fists struck him in the side as
he passed in the air and hurled him to the
pavement the shock almost knocked the
breath out of him and for a few moments he
lay partly stunned engle ran toward
him to finish what he had started with a
kick from one of his heavy shoes but an-
other and weightier antagonist had taken
a hand

  hobo smith had jumped to the rescue of
his dog and was on engles back raining
blows on his head engle forgot the dog
for the time and lunging backward tried
to break the smaller mans hold by strik-
ing his body against the wall smith
grunted but held on remembering that
when his dog had hit the pavement he had
not even whimpered

  ill get you panted engle ill kill
the two of you

  but with the threat there came to hobo
smith that perfect thing which reasoner

had first given him a glimpse of and in
which arab had further instructed him
and which all day and during the weeks
past he had been striving for he was
made over something warm and new
flooded his soul driving out all cowardice
timidity fear he was a man a resolute
purpose guided his blows he began to
think in the cool terms of a grim determina-
tion

  one of engles straining hands let go in
its backward search for smiths throat
arab was up and charging again this
time the dog came on a little more warily
as engle kicked he circled and dodged
watching for a chance his adversary was
handicapped with smith on his back then
as savagely as a springing wolf he had
found an opening leaped and drawn blood
and was away before engle could avenge

  smith had squirmed away from the
others grip when arab made his attack
and before engle could recover had struck
him two blows in the face engle staggered
the ripping jaws of the dog had torn a gash
down his right arm and one of smiths
unscientific blows had reached the point of
his jaw half-blinded he could not dodge
when the dog drove in again and this time
felt the hungry jaws at his throat

  take him off engle bellowed as he
stumbled backward to the pavement under
the weight of a third blow from smith and
the impact of the dog

  lie still then ordered smith and pried
arab away

  engles collar and tie had saved his
throat from serious damage a policeman
came running down the alley at its upper
end a crowd had collected to see what was
going on

  an escaped prisoner in civilian clothes
explained smith i tried to arrest him
and he resisted

  he spoke with confidence sure of him-
self arab stood between his knees watch-
ing the fallen engle ready to do battle on
an instant if his masters knees relaxed
their light pressure

  all right said the officer ill go on
out to the ship with you to make sure

  thanks said hobo smith and turned
to engle get up he commanded and
the bigger man obeyed

  hobo smith and arab with the hand-
cuffed engle and the policeman missed
only one boat when they reported on
arab



board the officer of the deck called the first
lieutenant smith stood aside with his
dog resting on the deck by him while the
policeman told the story of engles cap-
ture and the coal-passer was sent forward
under a marine guard to have his wounds
dressed before going into the brig then
the policeman was dismissed and the first
lieutenant turned to smith

  well smith he said youve made
good after all you and that stray pup of
yours what can i do for you

  smith hesitated making a decision was
one thing living up to it another

  step over here where well be alone
suggested the officer making a wrong guess
at his reluctance

  i want to give myself up said smith
quickly i let engle out i stole reason-
ers key and made a duplicate engle
slipped out of the brig when the marine
was on the other end of the beat i had
arab down there and the marine stopped
a moment to pat him

  what for demanded the amazed first
lieutenant what did you do that for
didnt engle try to make fish-bait out of
your dog

  and then smith told the whole miser-
able story of engles threat his love for
the dog and his fear that engle would harm
arab then of reasoners trouble over
the escaped prisoner his decision while
ashore to tell the truth to save his friend
and finally a request that reasoner have
the dog while he was being punished

  the first lieutenant was a man of wide
experience in the handling of men but
this problem puzzled him while he
thought he asked questions smith must
be punished of course but how so that
the mans new-found spirit would be
strengthened and not broken

  so you are doing this to save reasoner
who has been good to you the captain
and i had decided to disrate him

  yes sir answered smith

  what about engle this fireman that
he struck is much better i may have to
restore him to duty if he behaves himself
after he has had a chance to think it over
for a few months

  arab and me can handle him said
smith with a glance at the dog which
thumped his tail against the deck when his
name was called

  then said the first lieutenant be-
cause you wished to get reasoner out of
trouble and because you are no longer
afraid of engle you are making this con-
fession is there another reason

  yes sir said smith i want to start
all over clean and i couldnt bear to have
this thing haunting me besides he fin-
ished awkwardly arabs a gentleman
and hes got sense he might find it out
on me

  the first lieutenant made up his mind
go forward he said and tell rea-
soner to put you and arab in the brig for
three days solitary confinement you are
to have bread and water and the dog a
full ration

  thank you sir said smith and
salute he ordered arab

  the dog promptly sat up and raised a
forepaw to his nose then the two went
forward briskly this was the lightest
punishment that could be given

i i dogma explained reasoner to
slim higgins later is an estab-
lished principal or doctrine in any
mans case the doctrine is to keep on look-
ing until you find a path to the good in
him

  i like dogged just as well said slim
who was looking over dictionary dicks
shoulder its a couple of lines above
and means stubborn 

  but reasoner had shut the book quickly
sometimes slims levity got on his nerves

urford superintendent of the
western division on the d  p
railroad had before him a dis-
turbing letter it was not an
unexpected letter burford knew that sooner
or later it was bound to come because
there were not many things that escaped
general manager yorkes eyes neverthe-
less it was disturbing

  i note the general manager had writ-
ten that during the past three months we
have moved but two trains of stock from
billups during the corresponding three
months of last year we moved from billups
a total of twenty-five trains or an average
of about two trains weekly the falling
off is most serious

  my conclusion is that the stock must be
leaving billups via the c  m r i
suggest that you personally go into the
matter and see what can be done to recover
this lost business for our line

  burford knew just what yorke actually
meant when he said i suggest it was sim-
ply the general managers polite way of
saying i command and yorke bur-
ford was aware expected him to make good

  the superintendent leaned back in his
chair in a quandary the loss of the stock
business out of billups was a thing that had
been disturbing him not a little within
the last twelve months he had had no less
than five different agents there with a view
of reclaiming the cattle shipments that had
become diverted to the c  m r but
all to no purpose michie the agent there
now he knew would never accomplish

anything michie was too mild but where
to find another man burford didnt know
yet - that obviously was what he must do

  burfords mind ran over his fist of agents
one after another he mentally rejected-
some because not available due to being
tied up at important posts others because
of lack of ability or because of some pecu-
liarity of temperament he traveled down
the fine until he came to star city station
he considered joseph reilly agent there

  too young decided the superintendent
after a little cogitation

  he went on down the list

  and yet after he had gone dejectedly
over all his men and had about reached the
conclusion that among them there was not
the one whom he should have his thoughts
went back to the too-young agent at star
city

  deuce take it hes the best available
man of the lot growled burford finally
sitting up the thing is this ive got to
get somebody at billups in michies place
reilly looks to me like the best bet whats
the answer the answer is send reilly

  he looked at his watch then reached for
his hat

h

your ordinary agent seldom is
greatly pleased to see his superin-
tendent coming it usually means
trouble for somebody-and of course this
somebody invariably is the agent but in
joseph reillys young life a superintendent
more or less was neither here nor there


the better mixer



young joe greeted superintendent burford
easily and with no undue fluttering within
his breast when that official descended
from the early afternoon train at star city
how are things asked burford
everything is tip-top answered joe
business booming and all that i oughtnt
to kick he smiled a bit but thats the
trouble when everything is going good i
get restless

  come in the office said burford
perhaps i can help you some

  they entered the station and within the
office the superintendent took the agents
chair joe found himself another chair and
placed it near burford

  wtould you like to move began the
superintendent abruptly as soon as they
were seated

  moving is one of the best things i do
said joe he nodded yes sure when
and where

  if the superintendent expected a little
more obsequiousness he never betrayed
the fact rather he seemed to find some-
thing to relish in the easy assurance of his
agent burfords eyes took on a faint
sparkle

  tomorrow he answered and to
billups

  ill pack my tooth-brush and other
shirt tonight smiled joe ive never
been to billups but i hear its a real live
town

  its live enough assured burford
and we need a real live man there do
you think you might qualify

  joe smiled more widely

  im much too modest-

  hang your modesty laughed burford
youre no dead one-and i know that
all right have it your own way im the
live man for the live town and then
what

  and then as follows the superin-
tendents face became more serious in
the first place he began weve lost a lot
of business out of billups a year ago we
were handling two stock trains a week out
of there bound for south omaha but
just now were lucky if we get one in a
month the c  m r also goes through
billups you know-and theyve taken
practically all the cattle business away
from us its to get back to our old footing
that were aiming at

  our trouble started over a claim that

a stockman named mohr had entered
against us our claim department re-
fused to settle for the amount he declared
he should have he got sore spread his
grievance among his fellow-cattlemen gave
us a bad name and they all flocked over to
the c  m r and there theyve stuck

  our service is better than the c  m
rs-always has been and it has been
pretty well established since that mohr
the man who put in the trouble-making
claim was trying to hold us up but nei-
ther our better service nor the establishing
of mohrs unjust demands has seemed to
help us the shippers continue to stick
with our competitor the c  m r
why asked joe

  he had been paying strict attention to
burfords words

  thats the whole thing said burford
the answer to that why its this the

c	 m r has an agent up there named
mcpike mr mcpike is the villain he
holds em-the shippers i mean

  how asked joe

  by personality as near as i can find
out replied burford hes one great
little old mixer mr mcpike and you
know how the average cattleman likes a
good mixer he surely does hold the boys
down to his knitting

  i foresee said joe enthusiastically
that an interesting time will be had by one
and all im just dying to meet friend
mcpike he appeals to me

  hes no fool as you can guess said
burford youll find youve got a sure
enough job on your hands trying to get
some of those boys to come back to the

d	 p ill confess i dont know how
youll do it ill not give you any instruc-
tions you just go about it in your own
way

  thanks said joe if theres one
tiling ive a fondness for its orders like go
about it in your own way 

  another thing said burford in be-
ing a good mixer this man mcpike often
badly bends the rules what i mean is
he may sometimes take a drink or indulge
in cards or be away from his depot without
permission the c  m r i know is
aware of this but they only wink at it
burford glanced shrewdly at reilly we
may have to do a little winking ourselves
joe reilly never batted an eye-lid he
returned burfords gaze steadily


adventure

  exactly was all he said

  understand said the superintendent
quickly im trusting to your discretion
im no saint assured joe but i
know where to stop

  he was chuckling inwardly in apprecia-
tion of burfords predicament the super-
intendent did not want to seem to encourage
him to break any of the rules and yet if it
became necessary neither did he want joe
to be too prudish

  you can trust me in that added joe
i believe i understand just what you have
in mind

  im glad of that said burford with
relief if there were to be any actual
wrong i wouldnt want you to do it im
a little reluctant anyhow but weve
been sending agent after agent up there to
billups and not one has been able to do any
good so im getting desperate if we
can once get our old business back i know
we can hold it your job will be to get it
started back well do the rest

  he paused and looked earnestly at reilly
im counting on you to be the better
mixer he said is it a go

  its a go said joseph

ill

billups lies in the narrow south
end of a mighty v-shaped valley
to the north and northwest stretch
the broadening ranges whence come the
cattlemen with their droves seeking the
outlet to the markets this outlet is
billups with its two rival railroads-the

d	 p and the c  m r the d  p
skirts the eastern end of jhe town the

c	 m r the western edge

  ex-agent michie and young joseph
reilly-the latter newly installed agent for
the d  p-stepped out on to the station
platform on a friday just before noon
michie was leaving his train awaited down
at the water-tank while the engines tank
was filling the ex-agent spoke guardedly
in josephs ear

  watch that contwisted clerk of yours
warned michie its my opinion that hes
a bad one

  why so asked joseph

  i believe he tells things to mcpike in
fact im pretty near sure of it ive seen
him talking to mcpike when he thought i
wasnt near

  anything else will be appreciated
urged joe

  its this way every time i would get
one of these stubborn cowmen around here
persuaded to try our line it seems mcpike
would find it out flag the cowman and get
him to cancel the order for cars and then
ship over the c  m r i believe the
clerk kept his eye on all my car orders and
would tip mcpike off as to what was going
on doubtless mcpike handed him some-
thing for the information

  emmhl sounds interesting said
reilly

  the train pulled away from the water-
plug and came up to the platform michie
started towards his coach

  good-by said joe ill keep in mind
what youve told me

  good luck called michie and climbed
aboard

  consequently that afternoon reilly had
a conference with his office force one jack
dowdall the office force was operator
clerk and all-round handy man

  youve been here with the d  p how
long jacky asked joe

  oh about a year stated the clerk
  know all the folks about town

  most of em i been in this burg close
to two years

  what did you do before starting to
work with the d  p

  worked around was with the c 
m r for a while

  working for mcpike

  yes

  why did you quit

  not enough money

  the youthful dowdall yawned rolled a
cigaret and lit it reilly unobserved
eyed the clerk sharply from the first the
new agent had not been greatly impressed
with his office force dowdall was a fair
telegrapher-and that about let him out
now the revelation of the forces former
connection with mcpike on the c  m r
gave rise to a sudden suspicion-particular-
ly in the light of what michie had hinted at
joe decided to investigate further

whats been the matter with these
other agents whove been up here lately
inquired joe casually why couldnt
they haul in some business for the d  p
dowdall smiled patronizingly

   poor fish all of em

  how do you mean poor fish
the better mixer



  no brains no nerve the clerk gave
a little laugh as if the thoughts of the
deficiencies of the numerous ex-agents in
some way was not unpleasant this
mcpike is a regular hum-dinger hed
just tell them boys to head in and wherever
he said thats where they headed ini

  had em buffaloed eh

  the clerk laughed aloud

  say he guessed every move them poor
fish planned to make and he headed em off
every time

  well what do you think about me
any use to try and buck him

  jacky smiled again it was a gentle
smile but the gentleness of it was almost
lost in the patronizing superiority of it
something pitying was in it too

  ill tell you condescended the clerk
no not a bit of use you havent got
a chance

  youre wrong jacky joes voice
abruptly became sharp and short wrong
i say get your hat and coat

  what asked dowdall apparently
mildly surprised

  get your hat and coat ordered joe
two articles there on a nail behind the
door

  the clerk did as ordered the curtness
of the new agents words appeared to sink
into his brain he looked uneasy as reilly
opened the office door

  get out said joe shortly youre
through

  im through cried the clerk what
do you mean

  exactly what i said ill not need you
any longer

why - why stuttered dowdall
whats the matter what have i done
enough answered joe calmly go
and tell mcpike you want your old job
back

  some understanding of what was in
reillys mind evidently came to the clerk
at that

  you got me wrong he said sullenly
im not siding in with him

  maybe jacky-maybe said joe
but im figuring the other way he
smiled amiably at the crestfallen dowdall
sorry old boy but when youre working
for a man you want to work for him-and
not for some one else

  a flush came into dowdalls face dis-
closing that the shot had touched also

a little gleam of new-found respect for
reillys keenness came into his eyes a
little gleam which he tried to hide

  aw forget it he growled and flung
out of the depot

  from his office window joe watched
dowdall stride away perhaps hed been
hasty but he thought not he sat down
and sent a message to burford

supt burford

  my clerk has left please send another

j reilly

  by the time he had gotten the message
off some fifteen minutes had passed since
the time of dowdalls departure joe con-
sidered what to do next he had no
definite plan of campaign mapped out
and for a few moments he sat in a silent
study trying to think of some place to
start or some method to follow it must
be a vigorous method he decided and
then a tvhimsical idea came to him

  i believe ill go over and see mcpike
he suddenly exclaimed

  the more he thought of it the better
the whimsy pleased him he had no
trains coming for at least an hour or so
therefore he could lock up the depot for a
little time

  by jing yes he ejaculated springing
to his feet theres nothing like getting
acquainted with a man especially if youre
looking for a chance to kick him on the
shins

iv

being what is known as a weak
vessel jack dowdalls actions were
often governed by and his mind
was susceptible to the suggestion of some
stronger will hence it perhaps was not
strange that after leaving the d  p
depot he decided to go and see mcpike-
as reilly had suggested

  dowdall proceeded quickly across town
to the station of the c  m r agent
mcpike sat alone in his office when dowdall
arrived

  hello jack greeted mcpike then
perceiving the sullen expression on dow-
dalls face whats bothering you

  plenty replied jack he glared into
the shrewd face of the c  m r agent
the d  p has got another new agent
and the first thing the blasted fool did was
to tie the can on me


adventure

  agent mcpike settled comfortably back
in his chair the chair groaning in protest
as he did so the c  m r agent was
a big man tall and thick there were fine
wrinldes around his eyes as there are apt
to be around the eyes of men who laugh
much most folks noticed this but some
folks noticed more the thin almost cruel
lips of the man set close together hard and
straight

  so theyve got another one observed
mcpike that seemed to be the news that
interested him most who is he and
what kind of a guy

  take it from me returned dowdall
hes a real wide-awake guy he fixed
his gaze determinedly on mcpike but
thats not why i came-just to tell you
about him i want to know what youll
do to get me on the c  m r again

  the wrinkles around mcpikes eyes did
not contract but his mouth opened about
an eighth of an inch in a thin-lipped grin

  i cant take you on here jack he
replied complacently ive got a helper
and ones my limit

  well how about some other station
along the line

  mcpike shook his head

  no-no place i know of i understand
everybody is full up whats this new
guys name

  come on you cant put me off that
way cried dowdall peevishly you
could get me on if you wanted look what
all i did for you

  keep your shirt on returned mcpike
easily i guess you didnt lose anything
on me he regarded dowdall with cold
arrogant eyes you might have been of
some use to me over on the d  p but
now youre not

  then you wont help me any de-
manded dowdall

  too bad but i cant do a thing said
mcpike suavely once more exhibiting his
narrow smile

  at that moment a patron came to the
open office window

  come out and look at this case of coffee
mac he called in to the agent its all
smashed to the devil

  all right answered mcpike ill be
right along he rose and went out toward
the freight-house leaving the fuming dow-
dall alone in the office

  the telegraph instruments lined up along

  the desk at the front of the office clicked
persistently in dowdalls ears as he wrath-
fully reflected over mcpikes treatment
he had expected something better of the

c	 m r agent-at least a little assist-
ance in securing another job but this
calm rebuff this calm ignoring of all claims
brought home to the ex-clerk the fact that
being no longer in a position to furnish
information as to the activities of the

d	 p agent mcpike cared nothing as
to where he drifted the ex-clerk was
filled with vindictive thoughts-as usually
is the case of the person who finds himself
in a similar plight

  the telegraph instruments kept clattering
away in dowdalls ears being a teleg-
rapher himself and having at one time
worked in this office he was familiar with
all the calls and had as well a knowledge
of the business routine he heard the
division office calling some other office down
the line

  desire for vengeance crept into dowdalls
head if he only could get back at mcpike i
mcpike really was responsible for his
having lost the job on the d  p the
ex-clerk told himself

  a plan suddenly jumped into dowdalps
brain he sat up straight then got to his
feet and walked over quickly to the window
that faced the freight-house and peered out
mcpike was not in sight

  the bold bad scheme formed swiftly in
dowdalls head tomorrow saturday he
knew was the day when the big cattle
shipments were made from billups the
stock-cars always being forwarded from
the division terminal yards friday night
in time to arrive at billups early saturday
morning

  dowdall glanced again out the window
still no mcpike doubtless the agent
would be absent a few minutes more going
over the damaged case of coffee and check-
ing up the loss the division office was
still calling there would be time

  the ex-clerk opened the key on the
division office wire a mischief-making
message already formed in his brain

the c  m r station seemed
deserted when joe reilly arrived
there he entered through the
rear door of the waiting-room and looked
through the open ticket window he
beheld but one man within the office and
the better mixer



he smiled a little as he perceived that it
was his late clerk dowdall the late
clerks back was toward the ticket window
apparently he had not heard reillys
entrance for he did not turn his head or
make any other sign to disclose that he
was conscious of the d  p agents
proximity

  reilly saw dowdall peer quickly out the
front office window there was something
strangely furtive about the quick glance
something sly in the very poise of the ex-
clerks head joe watched him silently
noting the vindictive lines of dowdalls
half-averted face also the working of his
uneasy fingers and then when the ex-
clerk all at once opened the telegraph key
with sudden resolution showing in his
crafty countenance joe strained his ears
to hear what the sounder spelled as dowdall
started a message

  the message came to an end and the
operator at the other end gave his ok
dowdall straightened up his face a little
flushed his eyes glittering triumphantly

  there - your hide mcpike he

ejaculated guardedly-but not guardedly
enough to prevent the words from reaching
joe reillys ears i guess maybe thatll
fix your clock-for a little bit anyway
joe reilly instantly and noiselessly
slipped out of the station he did not
comprehend all that had taken place in
the c  m r office but he did compre-
hend enough to give him a pretty shrewd
idea of it he decided swiftly that the
beginning of his personal acquaintance with
mcpike could wait

  mcpike has turned jacky down re-
flected joe his brain working at high
speed and jacky thinks he sees a good
chance to play the devil joe suppressed
a grin as a subtle plan suddenly began to
unfold before him alls fair in love and
business he commented silently so
why not

  apparently there was no answer to the
why not for he immediately legged it back
to the d  p station he entered his
office and from there sent another message
the message was as follows

supt burpord

  send me sixty or seventy stock-cars get them
here quick-before tomorrow noon if at all possible

j reilly

  after the message had gone reilly busied



  himself around the office at  the
southbound limited arrived and just as it
started to pull out joe was not greatly
surprised to behold his erstwhile clerk come
streaking across the station platform and
pile on to one of the coaches suitcase in
hand

jacky it seems is leaving for parts
unknown said joe hes wise in that
and to show that he harbored no hard
feelings he waved his hand at the departing
jacky

v

at a square table in a comer of
the oasis saloon the agent of the

c	 m r sat opposite a drooping-
mustached individual the hour was
around nine in the evening the oasis
was well filled with patrons the patrons
being for the greater part cattle-owners
arrived early for the morrows loading
the cattle-owners herds would follow
meantime they the cattlemen set them-
selves to a little recreation

  i tell you mac said the drooping-
mustached man the boys are getting a
little bit restless this last stunt of your
old railroad handling the stock so slow
that they exceeded the thirty-six-hour
limit and had to have one more feed than
usual made them pretty sore

  oh theyll get over that mohr said
mcpike with easy confidence we can
hold em

  dont you be too sure said mohr
firmly i heard them grumbling a lot
over that extra feed bill theyre like
everybody else-they dont like to be
kicked in the pocketbook by a railroad
i heard em saying the c  m r wasnt
the only road they could ship on

  mcpike looked a little worried at that
it was a boner the c  m r pulled
ill admit and dont think that i forgot
to tell the boss up at division headquarters
about it he promised the next bunchd
be handled quicker said hed just raise
cain along the line and wake the other
fellows up

  hed better declared mohr

  mcpike leaned a trifle closer to the
table

  the d  p has sent another new agent
here he said to mohr he grinned mean-
ingly im figuring on his helping to put
the boys back in a good humor again


adventure

  you dont sayl said mohr

 yes sir fellow named reilly just
got in today

  well go on tell me the rest

  i dropped a word in pegrams ear this
evening hes going to strike up with
reilly and steer him in here

  mohr looked pleased

  well if you can pull off your usual stunt
before the crowd maybe the boysll lose all
their sore thoughts pull it off good
though what kind of a hombre is this
reilly

  young chap mcpike smiled con-
fidently you just leave it to me

  the doors at the front of the saloon swung
open and two men entered joseph reilly
and a shining-faced heavy-set man it
was a rather boisterous entrance that the
two made rather it was a somewhat
boisterous entrance that the shining-faced
man made his voice could be heard
enthusiastically urging reilly to come in
and meet the boys-all good friends of his

  inside the doorway joe reilly stopped
the eyes of nearly all the patrons had
turned toward the doorway attracted by
the commotion there joe laid his hand
firmly on his conductors shoulder and cast
a calm glance around the room

  does this man belong to any of you
gentlemen he asked

  there was silence for a few seconds
among the assembled cattlemen then
here and there a little chuckle broke out

  i dont knows he belongs to any one
in particular offered a grizzled old cow-
man standing nearby he eyed joe with
approval but if he does belong to any
one i reckon itd be mcpike

  mcpike repeated joe where is
he

  the old cowman pointed a finger to the
table in the corner where the c  m r
agent and mohr were watching

  there he is the large gent seated to the
left

   reilly caught his late conductor by the
arm and speedily led him over to the table

  mcpike said joe abruptly here i
am this toady of yours tried to draw me
in here mr toady report to your
boss 

  a sudden silence had fallen in the saloon
men turned more attentively to the table
in the comer those who held glasses aloft
set them softly down on the bar joe

reilly was a stranger to all of them but
they sensed that something interesting was
coming off

  the toady stood without words looking
from reilly to mcpike he moistened his
lips once or twice but no sound came from
them

  you cant said joe shortly very
well ill speak myself he looked at the

c	 m r agent your friend didnt
fool me even a little bit mcpike hes too
clumsy it didnt take me a whole lot
more than a minute to guess that for some
reason other than mere friendliness he
wanted to get me in this place and i
guessed too that the reason was you all
right here i am what do you want

  mcpike raised his big bulk to his feet
he couldnt keep the astonishment out of
his eyes things were not going exactly as
he had planned he suddenly realized that
he was going to have a hard time making
a fool of this man in front of the cattlemen
the d  ps new agent was too aggressive
he carried things so to speak right into the
enemys country but mcpike resolved to
make an effort

  youve got a great imagination my
boy he boomed trying to throw a good-
natured note in with his patronizing air
he wrinkled his eyes to show his merriment
and what would i be wanting with you

  he drew himself to his full height but
if his thought was intimidation his thought
availed him nothing

  joe reilly looked at him with level eyes

  i just believe ill tell you he said
i believe thatd be a right good plan

  he bent forward slightly and fixed his
eyes on the c  m r agent

  you wanted this mcpike said joe
his words coming with calm assurance
you wanted to get me in here and then
after revealing to these men who i am
make me act the clown while you snapped
the whip ive heard of your methods with
other agents the d  p has sent here

  joe looked around for a brief instant to
the interested stockmen

  gentlemen he said ill introduce
myself my name is reilly-joseph
reilly and im the new agent for the

d	 p at billups

  once more there was a stillness in the
oasis while the cattlemen quietly regarded
reilly and then as before it was the
grizzled cowman who spoke
the better mixer



  were pleased to meet you said the old
man his eyes twinkled and there was a
subdued gurgling in his throat my
names man tooth-old sam mantooth
joe reilly turned a swift grin on him
then swung back to the c  m r
agent

  mcpike he said evenly you cant
do it you cant make me do anything
im telling you big fellow if you think
otherwise go to it

  the wrinkles had disappeared from
around mcpikes eyes the hard lines
around his thin-lipped mouth stood out a
dull angry red had come into his face his
eyes flamed with rage

  you young fool he roared you will
try to bluff me

  he took a quick step around the end of
the table and made a lunge at joe

  starting from the hip joe drove his fist
upward there was a sudden solid smack
and mcpike returned toward the same spot
that he had just left but returning he
did not travel on his feet the only thing
he did travel on was air and when he
arrived it was on his back whereon he laid
for a moment half-dazed

  bless my soul came from old sam
mantooth the immortal bob f was
right the bigger they are the harder
they fall he raised his voice mr
reilly id be much pleased if youd teach
me that

  joe smiled broadly at him

  call around at my office any day he
invited

  he looked down at the blinking mcpike
youre in a draft there maccy he
said pleasantly get up or youll catch
cold then ill tell you something else
his face betraying his embarrassment
mcpike scrambled to his feet and looked
at joe sourly

  before i say the something else pro-
ceeded joe ill give you a chance have
you any observations to make further
mcpike swallowed hard murder glared
in his eyes-hate at being made to appear
so helpless before the cattlemen the
tables had been reversed exactly from what
he had planned but swallow was all
mcpike did he ventured no word

  well never mind soothed joe but
what i was going to say was this id like
to lay a little wager with you that between
this and sunday ill have at least seventy-

five per cent of the cattle moving out of
billups traveling over the d  p what

say

  at that mcpike seemed to find his tongue
some of the arrogance came back into his
face

  if you do he cried may i be damned
theres no smart aleck going to come in
here and show off and then do anything like

that

  nevertheless returned joe evenly
im offering to lay the bet they tell
me youre quite a sporting man will you
accept a wager on that and if so what
will you stake on it

  accept it he shouted well i guess
yes and ill tell you what ill stake-
ill stake my job against yours if you
lose you quit if i lose i quit

  he glared with sudden triumph at
reilly the d  p agent had played
right into his hand this was a good way
to get rid of a man who in time might prove
a dangerous competitor for the cattlemens
patronage

  but the one day that came before sunday
was comparatively a short time mcpike
was confident he could hold the stockmen
to the c  m r for that long despite his
recent sorry showing and if the d  p
agent backed down now reilly would be
forever branded as no good sport as dis-
playing a yellow streak mcpike felt that
he had reilly coming and going

  joe reilly merely swung round to the
absorbed cattlemen

  youve heard the conditions he said
to them the bets on

vi

billups buzzed on saturday
morning with talk of friday nights
affair in the oasis naturally the
cattlemen had not been backward in giving
out the details billups received the news
with relish and then took to discussing the
matter at great length and the final
practically unanimous verdict was that
while they admired reillys nerve and
acclaimed his skill they nevertheless were
convinced that he had overdone himself
in the matter of the wager

  after making such a showy beginning
why should any man go and lay himself
open to such an anti-climax asked billups
mcpike it was decided had shown great


adventure

astuteness in drawing the terms of the bet
it was felt that in this he had regained much
of the prestige he had temporarily lost in
the first part of the oasis episode that
mcpike could hold the shippers to the

c	 m r for this one day billups had
not the least doubt

  it was nearly eight oclock when mcpike
reached his station on saturday morning
and when he did arrive there he was
surprised to find no stock-cars on the cattle-
chute sidings mcpike stared batted his
eyes then hurried into the office he pulled
tie plugs from the switchboard sat down
at his message wire key and swiftly began
to call the division office

  in a moment or two the division office
answered and mcpike dashed off a message
to his superintendent

surf hibbard

  no stock-cars on hand to take care of todays
loading advise quick when they will arrive

p h mcpike

  twenty minutes later mcpike received
an answer

p h mcpike

  no cars scheduled for your station account all
orders canceled by your wire of yesterday p m
why do you now ask for cars

hibbard

  mcpike regarded this message in-
credulously holding the key open the
while

  what in the devil he snorted
whats he trying to do-kid me

  he made several meaningless dots and
dashes on the wire then composing
himself enough to think straight he fired
another message to headquarters

supt hibbard

  have postively no knowledge of any message
cancelling car orders will need cars today as
usual must have them as shippers already are
arriving with stock

p h mcpike

  the cattle were indeed arriving from
his office windows mcpike could see the
first bunch rounded up near one of the
stock-chutes while he awaited his answer
another bunch arrived and directly the
owners of the two droves came up to the
station and entered

  wheres the cars mac asked the first
arrival

  mcpike turned a worried face around
they should have come in early this
morning scherr he answered ive
wired about em and am just waiting for a
reply stay round a minute till i see
the sounder began to clatter his call just
then and he answered the operator at
headquarters started his message

p ii mcpike

  following message from your office was received
by us at  pm yesterday owing to unforeseen
delays stockmen will not be able to ship tomorrow
cancel all orders for stock-cars will later advise
fully as to date needed signed-p h mcpike
acting on this message we canceled movement of all
stock-cars for billups and have sent all our surplus
empties north impossible to forward any cars to
you today and probably not tomorrow monday
being earliest date we can promise would be glad
to have an explanation of the inconsistency shown
in your various wires

hibbard

  mcpike fairly bounced out of his chair as
this message was completed he let out a
yell that brought the two cattlemen running
to the window

  whats the matter mac called
scherr

  matter shrieked mcpike waving the
message matter

  he filled the air with burning words for a
minute then smacked the message down
before them

  read that

  the two read the words carefully they
looked up in perplexity

  whats it mean mac asked scherr
why did you cancel the cars on us
cancel em roared mcpike i didnt
not in a thousand years somebodys
playing me dirt

  the two looked steadily at him sudden
suspicion came into their eyes

  it looks that way said the second man
mildly

  something in his tone caused the agents
face to flush angrily

  you dont think it was me do you
he demanded good god toomey why
would i i want to keep your business not
drive it away

  yes thats so put in scherr you
wouldnt be liable to do anything like that
but sometimes these danged railroads do
funny things maybe your road thinks we
can just lay around and keep our cattle here
till they get ready to furnish the cars on
monday
the better mixer



  no sir protested mcpike the
companys not made up of such fools i
tell you somebody else has had a hand in
this

  well who asked toomey a half-
humorous light came into his eyes maybe
that d  p agent who made the bet with
you last night did it

  mcpike gaped at the cattlemen

  by thunder he bellowed by thun-
der he smashed his fist on the window
ledge youve said it

  but how could he cut in scherr he
wasnt here in your office was he
mcpikes face fell a little

  no he admitted he wasnt

  he wrinkled his brows in thought for a
moment then all at once recollection of
jack dowdalls presence in the office while
he mcpike was out in the freight-house
checking up the damaged case of coffee
came to the c  m r agent he looked
up at the two stockmen

  it wasnt reilly himself he exclaimed
but his clerk was in here-that double-
faced dowdall

  he whirled away from the window
slammed open the office door and emerged
into the waiting-room- where scherr and
toomey were

  what now inquired scherr

  im going over and see that d  p
man stormed mcpike he cant put
his clerk up to anything like that and then
get away with it

  remember cautioned toomey dryly
that boy totes a pretty fair wallop
around with him dont do anything
rash

  rash- cried mcpike im going

over-and the wallop wont have anything
to do with this case

  he patted his belt significantly

  well we might as well go too said
scherr

  he and toomey fell in step as mcpike
bolted out

  at the edge of the station platform they
met a bunch of three more shippers just
arrived

  wheres our cars mac demanded one
of the new arrivals

  hush warned toomey macs got
something on his mind

  the three seemed puzzled

  but where- began the man who had
spoken before

  oh shucks said toomey were on
our way to see about it come along

  he winked gravely

  so the three perceiving the wink fell in
also and as they hastened toward the

d	 p station scherr and toomey ex-
plained briefly to them

vii

the early morning d  p train
north on saturday was handled
by the same crew that had been
on the southbound limited the evening
before just before the northbound pulled
out this saturday am the brakeman came
running to joe reilly with a letter

  that clerk of yours who went south
with us yesterday gave me this letter he
said to be sure and give it to you when i
came back up this morning said the
brakeman

  thanks said joe and held it unopened
in his hand until the train had pulled away
then he tore the sealed envelop open
within was but one sheet of paper

  joe read what was written thereon and
when he came to the end he whistled
softly

  well maybe this will come in handy
he commented and stuffed the letter in his
pocket

  somewhere around  old sam man-
tooth dropped in at the depot

  i aint doin any shipping today he
explained to joe just come to town to
look round he eased himself against the
window ledge hows business

  not so good as it will be smiled joe

  old sam smiled also

  just between you and me he said
i believe mcpike needs to be taken down
a peg but it gets me how youre figurin
 winning that bet

  you wait and see advised joe smiling
more widely

  ill sure do that answered sam
ill just sort of stick around and keep my
eye open he regarded joe silently for a
few seconds that mcpike is no man to
fool with son you laid him out real slick
last night but the next time you want to
watch

  ill be watching promised joe

  a few minutes afterward mantooth
strolled out but ten minutes later he
hurried in again


adventure

  mcpikes cornin with a bunch he
announced quickly hes cornin afog-
gin

  joe who had been busy at the wire now
and then casting an expectant glance up
the track to the north arose from his chair
at once pulled on his coat put on his hat
and came out of the office

  im much obliged he said to mantooth
as he stepped toward the waiting-room
door ill just go out and meet him

  sam followed

  if you need any help- he offered

  thanks again but im not expect-
ing to

  joe swung the door open and stepped
out

  just outside the depot joe and old sam
met mcpike and his party thec m r
agents eyes were snapping his face twitch-
ing

  so thats the way you do things is it
cried mcpike coming to a halt put
your clerk up to coming in my office with a
cock-and-bull story and then while im out
have him send a lying message to get me all
balled up he thrust his head forward
wrathfully youre a rotten sneak

  joe reilly contemplated mcpike com-
posedly

  you surprise me he said coolly be-
sides which you lie

  is that so shouted mcpike til
show you something

  his hand jerked toward his hip

  there was a single flash and report the
pistol that mcpike had drawn flew from his
hand and fell to the platform

  this is a cheap trick i know said joe
reilly apologetically but it was about
the only thing i could do

  mcpike nursed the stinging fingers of his
otherwise unhurt gun-hand he stared at
reilly the agent of the d  p was
standing at ease his hands nestling in the
side pockets of his coat so lightning-
quick had been the drawing of his gun and
the shot that joes movements had almost
baffled the eye but old sam mantooths
eye had not been baffled

  that was real nice said old sam
excuse me mr reilly for ever being so
bold as to offer you advice

  away to the north the piercing whistle
of an approaching train sounded joe
pricked up his ears at the sound his eyes
brightened

 mcpike he said youve got the
wrong idea and i can prove it

  from his pocket he pulled the letter that
the brakeman had handed him he ex-
tracted and unfolded the sheet of paper

  heres a little letter i received just an
hour or so ago id like to have you
hear it

  aloud he read

mr reilly

  if mcpike comes around blaming you for mixing
up his stock-car orders you show him this letter
hell likely be around blaming you but of course
you had nothing to do with it

  while in his office this afternoon i sent a message
to his superintendent to cancel all his orders for
cars maybe the next time liell know better than
to turn down flat a man whos done as much as
ive done for him

j dowdall

  joe finished reading and passed the sheet
of paper to mcpike

  i guess you know his writing he said
you can tell its genuine

  mcpike took the letter and examined it
closely it was plain that he was con-
vinced

  dowdall beat it yesterday continued
joe and when i received the letter i
was at first a little surprised because
dowdall has no cause to love me con-
sidering that i gave him the bounce yes-
terday but ive doped out since that he
wrote it through pure vanity you see
he wouldnt have enjoyed his revenge real
good unless he was certain that you
mcpike would find out it was he whod
gummed things up for you he wanted all
the credit for himself-wanted to show you
how he put it over you and he figured that
youd be coming to see me and that id
show you the letter and ill say this for
him that he figured it out pretty straight
there was a minutes silence mcpike
was doing some heavy thinking things
were becoming clearer to him every
second

 it looks to me spoke up old sam
mantooth as if mr mcpike was trying
to rope the wrong horse

  he glanced questioningly at the men who
had come with the c  m r agent

  by judas yes cried scherr his eyes
and the eyes of the others wereturned on
joe with open respect i hope youll not
have any hard feelins against any of us
boys
the discoverers



  sure not answered joe promptly

  an irrepressible friendly grin came to
his face

  but i dont mind making a little con-
fession he said as dowdall says i had
nothing to do with the message he sent
but ill admit i did know that he sent it

 you knew it flashed mcpike
when

  yesterday afternoon joe turned his
friendly grin directly on mcpike you
see i thought id just go over and get
acquainted with you and when i stepped
into your station there was dowdall alone
in your office sending the message i
heard it

  ill be blasted cried mcpike mat-
ters were becoming clearer still to him
and then you went away without waiting
to get acquainted

  exactly returned the smiling joe
i felt that was best its been war be-
tween your road and mine you know so
i decided itd be a foolish stunt not to grab
the break when it came my way

  the freight from the north by now had
drawn near its deep whistle once more
roaring out as joe finished speaking they
all looked up the track toward it the
engines-for it proved to be a double-
header-swung around a long curve and
came in sight and after the engines came
a long string of empty stock-cars the
engines drifted down to the stock-yard sid-
ing and stopped a brakeman jumped
down threw the switch and gave a signal

  joe turned to face the cattlemen

  and in the meantime he said if you
boys are having any trouble getting your

stock out why herere lots of cars ill
be pleased to help if you can use em

  the cattlemen had been regarding joe
in a rather puzzled sort of way but at
his words their faces cleared

  you son of a gun exclaimed scherr
use em you bet your life catch us
waiting round here till monday for cars
on the c  m r what do you say
boys

  bet your life cried the rest of the boys
scherr faced about and began to move off
wait a second called joe i just
want to say that as far as im concerned
of course that little bet mcpike and i laid
is off providing i won i never had any
very serious intentions of demanding its
payment his ever-ready smile again
broke out things wouldnt be half as
interesting around here if hed leave
you son of a gun said scherr again

  it seemed to be the only expression he
couldfind that suited his lean cheeks
wrinkled into a grin that matched joes

  youre more than smooth-youre a
dead game sport

  he turned to the other stockmen

  come on he said lets go and get
our stuff headed over this way

jj saturday evening just before
he left his office for the day super-
intendent burford received a mes-
sage from billups it read

supt btofokd

   loaded and forwarded today sixty-six cars stock
two trains of thirty-three cars each c  m r
handled none

hat roared the governor
five hundred pounds less than
last year

i five hundred and sixty-two
pounds six shillings your excellency re-
plied his secretary

  sir william berkeley struck the table
with his jeweled snuff-box and rose to his
feet he shook back the lace cuits from his
wrists impatiently and strode across the
room to the window

  there were more traders he asked
finally without turning

  two more than the year before your
excellency

  and weve killed off none of the savages
has less fur been taken or have we not
received it

  there is no reason your excellency to
believe that the savages have taken less
they are eager enough for the goods

  the governor wheeled and faced his
secretary

  what would you do an you were in
my place he demanded

  you wish me to advise your excellency
call it what you will i care not
whether it be advisement or expostulation
i know this much all fur of the colony
every hide and hair is to pass through
my hands and it does not i am indiffer-
ent to the few paltry pounds i lose but
there is sedition rebellion defiance of the
king and of the kings will in this

  the secretary discreetly remained silent

while the governor paced from the table
to the window and back the plier of
quills knew his excellency too well to
attempt speech now any word would
be incautious in the face of the rising
tempest he was surprised however when
sir william his eyes thoughtful the storm
cloud passed suddenly stopped and asked-
is that disgraceful son of captain
jeffreys in the gaol

  he is your excellency

  they tell me that he has been to the
blue mountains has traveled far to the
north even to the plymouth companys
lands

  even farther your excellency if report
be true i have heard that he has crossed the
st lawrence that he spent a year with the
french

  the st lawrence eh thats where
the fur is found in plenty and where none
escapes and ive heard it said that with
the exception of the longhouses the
indians are always friendly to the french
still thoughtful the governor turned
again to the window and looked out over
the river the far reaches of which were
tinted with that first fresh delicate green of
budding leaves at last he spoke quickly
decisively

  bring me the charges against this young
jeffreys all of them write them out
clearly and at length

  an hour later the secretary placed a
neatly copied sheet before the governor


before marquette



  now commanded sir william have
the warder of the gaol conduct this young
rover before me at once

  here your excellency

  yes here and the governors face
grew red with his fury here in this room
and at once

  sir william had read the paper through
three times before there was a knock

  come in he thundered and the door
opened to admit his secretary

  he has been brought your excellency
the governor looked up to see a strange
figure framed by the big-planked portal
not in the gold and lace and bright colors of
the gentry of virginia was he clothed nor
in the rough costume of an indented servant
on his feet were moccasins beaded the
tops rolling over to escalloped edges his
legs long straight and not too heavy
were encased in buckskin leggings and
down each outer seam was a long fringe of
the leather

  he wore a shirt of woolen and over it a
buckskin jacket that reached below his
hips and around the edges across the
shoulders and down the arms of which
were long fringes like those of the leggings
on his head was a cap made of the skins of
mink and hanging from the top of it was
the long bushy tail of a gray fox

  the garb strange as it was held the
governors attention for only a moment
the face under the brown cap smooth-
shaven brown was one the handsome
royalist himself would have envied in his
youth the forehead was high and wide
the eyes gray steady and frank were wide
apart the lips were full but slightly com-
pressed and beneath was a chin that was
as square as the perfect symmetry of the
face would permit

  there was no question no curiosity no
cringing in the gaze that met the gover-
nors there was something stately yet
free in the poise of the head and the lithe
figure while it seemed molten within the
leathern garments still had that easy
dignity and grace of carriage which dis-
tinguishes the animals the skins had once
clothed

 your hat sirrah thundered sir
william

  with a smile the young man in the door-
way plucked the fur helmet from his head
and still with a smile he stood looking at
the governor

 begone commanded his excellency
 with a nod to his secretary

 the amanuensis slipped out past the
 silent figure that still stood in the doorway

 come hither

 the young man entered and behind him
 came two armed guards from the gaol

 i said begone cried the governor

 but your excellency expostulated
 one of the men with a glance toward the
 prisoner

 begone and close the door to

 now sirrah you are richard
 jeffreys eh he continued when
 he and the young man were alone

 the same was the calm reply

 the son of captain jeffreys of jeffreys
 manor

 the same

 sir william picked up the paper his
 secretary had prepared

 and yet you the son of an honorable
 god-fearing loyal subject of the king
 a son who should be the pride of his father
 lie in gaol under the charge ot failure tc
 attend church blasphemy failure  plant
 corn illicit trade with the indians smug-
 gling furs and seditious utterances there is
 proof enough to hang you three times over

 so i have been told agreed the young
 man calmly

 been told and do you have to be told
 when you shatter every law of the colony

 i am sometimes a stranger to the colony
 and its laws do not always follow me it
 would interest me greatly to read the laws
 as they stand today i am sure they
 would be enlightening

 read shouted the governor you
 can read

 assuredly

 and i who have thanked god often
 enough that there were no schools or
 printing presses in the colony live to see
 the like of the heathen savages stand before
 me with this insolent boast of his learning

 his excellency purple with passion rid
 himself of enough finable oaths to stand
 his own proud figure upon the gallows ten
 times over he slopped only when his
 vision cleared of the rage mist and he found
 the young man looking at him with uncon-
 cealed interest and a slight smile upon his
 bps

 it pleases me he said when the gov-
 ernor was silent at last that the laws


adventure

have been so broadened that a slip of the
tongue or righteous anger can no longer
send a man dangling at a ropes end

  the thrust served to renew the sterm
and through it all the young man stood
across the table his eyes twinkling with
amusement where his words had failed
his attitude his hidden laughter served
to bring the governor to his senses

  the ropes end knotted noosed awaits
you his excellency said fiercely but
aside with that jt matters not now
there is another reason i have for bringing
you here they tell me you have been
to the blue mountains

  yes and beyondl

  beyondf

  sir williams anger fell from him as a
cloak might drop from his shoulders he
leaned forward across the table his eyes
eager his bearing no longer that of the
kings ruler of virginia colony

  then he said at last his voice husky
have you seen the south sea the red sea
what they call the gulf of california
no answered young jeffreys the smile
in his eyes verging upon laughter had
i seen it it might be that the noose would
be unknotted were i to lead your men
to it

  i would cut it with mine own sword
for the south sea means gold and the king
needs gold

  king

jeffreys stiffened and his face hardened
why should the gold be the kings
he asked has he ever left england
has he ever seen this land have his
minions ever seen it

  it is the kings domain snapped the
governor his by right of discovery by
right of conquest by the right god has given
him

  god has given him god made that land
but he never destined it for a king there
lies not an inch of kings land beyond the
blue mountains and there never will
that land is too broad too fair too pleas-
ant a kings wish would be lost in it a
kings voice-would echo in vain among its
hills a kings lungs would wither if they
once inhaled the pure air that sweeps the
plains god set aside that land for men
and some day they will take it

  he stopped suddenly and smiled at the
horror-stricken face of the governor

  i feel the noose tighten he mocked

  you will before tomorrows sun rises
whispered his excellency between clenched
teeth where did you learn this sedition
your father

  leave my father out of this answered
jeffreys sharply he lives his own life
i live mine he was born in england he
is a good man true to his teachings to this
absurd theory that a man by divine right
can oppress other men

  but i was born in the colony of virginia
i have never seen a king and thank god
no king has ever seen the land of my birth
nor ever will my thoughts are mine own
i could have no others after seeing this land
of men beyond the blue mountains

  you have preached this asked the
governor the words coming with difficulty

  there are others who think and preach
the same tell me they may sever your
noose

  jeffreys laughed outright

  the governor seems to wish that i cheat
the gallows he said with a suggestion of
interrogation in his tone

  i would hang you and every traitor of
your ilk with the greatest joy and hang

you will tomorrow at dawn unless-

  his excellency paused and jeffreys said
with a smile

 unless-

  you are young you have wit and with
that wit must go courage to take you past
the blue mountains where no white men
have been there is yet hope for you
the king needs you there is this have
you ever preached such sedition to others
my thoughts have always been vague
unformed they came to my mind as
the air beyond the blue mountains came
to my lungs perhaps it is the air in that
land that breeds them i only know it
is not so close as this in the colony it
seems untainted but when the thoughts
came to me i did not rush back and preach
them perhaps i would some time i had
no intention of doing so today until you
drove me to it

  i cried berkeley i but let that
lie you have not spoken so to others
and you say your thoughts are vague
there is something that may dispel them
as the sun sweeps the fog from the river
in the morning love of life would do that
the governor paused and studied the
young mans face the laughing eyes told
him no tiling
before marquette



  give me your attention he said at last
straightening in his chair and speaking
quickly as if he had reached a decision and
wished the matter settled they tell me
you have been north past the st
lawrence

yes i spent a year with the french
then you know something of the fur
trade of the methods they employ of how
they keep on such amiable terms with the
savages

  my eyes were always open and i had
many opportunities

  good the fur trade of virginia is not
as it should be there is need of a better
understanding with the indians though
god knows i have done all i could do to
placate them

  placate exactly interrupted jeffreys
quiet sirrah shouted the governor
your life is at stake this fur business
must be controlled as the king would have
it unlicensed traders are visiting the
indians the dutch are smuggling one
of their ships was in the chesapeake only
last week a man must go among the
indians win them completely and he must
catch these outlaw traders red-handed
must find where they meet the smugglers
and bring the information that will permit
us to apprehend them

  combine the offices of envoy and spy
smiled jeffreys

  silence roared the governor there
is no spying on outlaws and traitors this
would be in the service of the king the
gallows are waiting for you the gallows or
this

  jeffreys in no way showed surprise but
he did turn and look out of the window
at the broad river placid in the late after-
noon of an early spring day at the sun
glinting from the freshly budding leaves

  you are young you love life as i can
see now by your glance at the sunshine
continued the governor take an oath
of allegiance to his majesty here before me
mend your ways and captain jeffreys son
may live to be a credit to him to him and
to his king no one will ever know come
be quick say the word and you live
now

  this moment my patience can not
last longer

  but you are asking me to make myself
over instanter to implant in myself new
thoughts new ideas a new mind a new

heart i have always been free wandering
where i wished and the life has been sweet
the ydor of a wigwam is not washed from a
man in an hour

  you hesitate between life and death
between death and the manner of life
and jeffreys glanced out of the window at
the long shadows i wish three hours in
wich to adjust myself my mind is slow
and can not be spurred

  you deserve not three minutes but
you may wait only remember that the
noose is certain at dawn

  and i will send you word from the
gaol asked jeffreys the smile again in
his eyes

  no i will have you brought here
there are other things beside the fur of
which i would speak when that is
attended to there is the south sea you
not only have the opportunity of life but of
honor of achievement for your king and
of your kings gratitude

   in three hours i will tell you

  his excellency struck the table with his
fist and cried-

  warder

  the door opened and jeffreys was led
away

a few minutes later he stood
looking out between the bars of his
cell it was the supper hour and
the street beneath him was empty of all
except two or three hurrying servants

   jeffreys eyes however were on the tops
of the trees where the sun still lingered
his ears were tuned only for the twitter of
industrious nest-builders in the sycamore
across the way it was life budding
joyous life that he saw and heard all about
him and he smiled though not wistfully or
longingly

  dick dick came a stifled cry
beneath him

  betsvkins he exclaimed even before
he looked down what are you doing

here

  oh dick and the girl who was no
more than seventeen looked up with
streaming eyes and blanched face is it
true are they going to-to-to hang you
in the morning

  so they say before the sun comes up
again but what brings you here you
must hasten away or there will be talk of
you
o

adventure

  i had to dick father was coming
to jamestown this morning and i made him
bring me he is waiting now in the
ministers house wondering where i am
for i ran away oh dick i had to see

you again i-

  she stopped speaking and covered her
face with her hands even so far above her
he could hear her sobs

  come come betsykins he whispered
you must run back some one will see
you when does your father return to
carver manor

  at once

  then hasten to him for he will be
waiting

  but dick they cant hang you they
must not

  come and his tone was a little im-
patient you must go

  i care not if i am seen i had to talk
to you again dick

  and talk with me you shall this very
night litue betsy he whispered his face
pressed between the bars i thought i
had not a friend in the colony and now
when one comes she deserves the best
deserves what she wishes come now
run along to the ministers that your father
may not be delayed and tonight at nine
oclock be in the little grove of sycamores
below your fathers wharf

  dick dont jest

i am not jesting go quickly and to-
night ill talk to you for fifteen minutes
but dick you are in a cell guarded

and at dawn-

again she hid her face in her hands
elizabeth whispered dick sharply
leave at once some one is coming up
the street and you must not be seen talking
with a gaolbird

  but the guards those bars

  they are nothing for i go on a kings
mission and he laughed softly remem-
ber the sycamores at nine i will be
waiting for you

chapter ii

the tryst at the sycamores

xell demanded governor berkeley
  when the door closed and he and
dick jeffreys were alone

  the young mans head was bent his easy
confident bearing had vanished and he

stared down at the table between him and
his excellency

  does the noose have to tighten about
your neck before your wild brain will come
to itself and act

  it is hard to decide was the hesitating
answer you see i do not know all that
i am to do all that is required of me
first of all sirrah you are required to
acknowledge your king to swear allegiance
anew and to remain loyal to him and to
the church that is no more than is
required of any subject of his gracious
majesty nay it is a privilege of which
any one in the colony should be glad

  secondly you must abandon the wild
ideas to which you so heedlessly gave voice
this afternoon you must be loyal in
thought as well as in action

  and then

  following that and the governor
leaned forward his elbows on the table
his haughtiness giving way to sudden
intentness there is the fur trade you
have knowledge of the indians you under-
stand the methods of the french you
know something of the outlaw traders who
are smuggling pelts to the dutch that
must be stopped and you with the power
of the king behind you are to stop
it

  that done and it should be accom-
plished in a year there is the matter of the
south sea the red sea of the spanish
the gulf of california the way to the
indies there is this kingdom of quivira
which the spaniards never found which is a
second peru there is gold and there are
pearls and rubies across the blue moun-
tains somewhere they can not be far
for the indians say that the eastern sea
beats against a rock from which our own
roanoke flows

  the french are pushing westward to the
headwaters of the st lawrence already
they have reports of the great water only a
little way beyond we can not let them
find and take this land these rich treasures
while we sit idle true the king has sent
no commands has not expressed a wish
but we would not be loyal subjects were we to
cast aside opportunities for new empires
i am to find these treasures for the
king asked dick looking up for the first
time

  would you take them for yourself you
a gaolbird
before marquette

l

  would i risk the savages and strange
lands famine and thirst for a man i never
saw never will see who has done nothing
for me

  egad sirrah another word of that and
you will fatten the crows im offering
you a chance for your life and you quibble
dost not know that the king is the ap-
pointed of god that he rules by gods
right and that thou a crawling worm upon
gods footstool art answerable to the
king

  perhaps i have been away from the
colony too much answered dick slowly

  he had turned toward the window
his countenance was pensive though in his
eyes which the governor could not see
was a gleam of amusement a twinkle that
belied the seriousness of his tone when he
continued

  i have been in many far places among
the savages across mountain ranges beside
great lakes on the banks of wide rivers on
the edges of fertile plains i had never
given much thought to kings and men
until then somehow perhaps as the air
came to my nostrils things came to my
mind out there the sun was warm the
flowers were bright and carpeted the
ground the birds sang in the trees the
winds faintly rustled the leaves it was
fair a heaven upon earth life was full
complete

  then i remembered things as they were
in the colony men sold to slavery because
they dared think men better than i who
had dared oppose a kings will branded
because they sought that freedom i had
for the taking i remembered the whip-
pings and the pillory here in jamestown
the binding laws and the cramping customs
and yet only half a hundred leagues away
i was beyond the influence of kings and
kings laws out where the air and sky and
water and woods were free where a man
could think and pray and swear with only
his own consciousness of what is right to
govern him

  and that fair land that free land you
ask me to go and take in the name of a king
in the name of all that which is not free
you ask me for the sake of my life to bind a
country and a people with the thongs
which bind virginia to stifle and oppress
to enslave and degrade

  he wheeled suddenly from the window
and leaned across the table peering into the

purple distorted shocked face of sir
william

  ha-e you noticed he said that not
once this evening or today have i ad-
dressed you as your excellency or even
is sir ill tell you why you have not
my respect in the name of this king you
have ruled this colony in the name of
yor own love of power your own selfish-
ness your own disregard for the rights
the hearts and the minds of your fellow-
beings you have refused the people the
right to elect their own representatives
you have condemned men to death because
you liked not the color of their hair you
have grown fat while honest men men who
dared tell what they think have slaved in
this colony without enough to eat or wear

  i tell you governor berkeley you and
your kind have come to the wrong land
it may be that god gave your king the right
to rule you may believe that or attempt
to make others believe it if you will but
i know that god set aside this land for men
for kingless men for the rule of right and
justice and i tell you now governor
berkeley that before a hundred years have
passed men will rule this land

  for a full minute he stared straight into
his excellencys eyes a procedure that only
increased the anger which already so choked
the governor he could not speak dicks
own eyes were dancing and their glee lifted
the corners of his mouth then suddenly
as sir william was about to gain sufficient
control to voice his rage the young man
burst into a low laugh

  there that is said he cried a
mouth-filling speech was it not the
greater part of it i learned from a trapper
a puritan with whom i spent a winter
beyond new amsterdam or new york
i believe it is now a queer old bookworm
i have often wished i could try it on some
one like yourself but i never thought
i would have the pleasure i never
dreamed that your own avarice would
some time give me this opportunity to
speak with you alone that your own fear
of the slipping power of kings your dread
of the intoxication of the free air of this
land would make you stoop to plotting
here in this room with a gaolbird but i
have had my chance i have taken it
now this other of which you speak to
be sure i-

  he stopped and peered again into the


adventure

governors face smiled when he saw that
perplexity and lack of understanding were
effacing his excellencys rage

h dick straightened threw back his
shoulders turned his head careless
toward the window languidly he
raised his arms then suddenly his hands
shot down his body seemed to drop and the
next instant he had leaped up and forward

  before the astonished governor could
think or move the young man was crouching
on his heels on the table directly in front of
him his laughing face was thrust forward
to within a foot of the outraged visage

  sir william berkeley was no coward but
neither was he a match for the young
athlete before him at his first movement
the first parting of his lips dicks hands
reached out one grasped his excellencys
throat the other closed his mouth and bent
back his head

  not a move or your own breast shall
sheath your dagger whispered the laugh-
ing dick not a sound for sounds do
not now accord with my plan we have 
talked and to no purpose you offered
me a noose or a place to suckle at the breast
of the royal sow do you remember the
eagle an indian brought to the tavern a
few years ago and which hung in a cage at
the door you asked me to become as
that eagle asked me who have known
the free air of a free land to submit to a
kings fetters and do you remember how
one day that eagle grasped the hand of a
drawer at the tavern when the cage door
was open and how he fought his way out to
freedom

  even now your own hand is in the
eagles grip i knew this afternoon your
fear for your unjust profits in the fur trade
was greater than your desire to punish
what you term sedition i knew you
would have me here again tonight and i
knew that thereby you would give me my
chance

  sir william berkeleys face became
purple under the pressure the grip of
dicks fingers was like that of a smiths
vise but now it suddenly loosened and he
whipped from his waist a long sash which
he had not worn in the afternoon

i will leave this with your excellency as a
memento he said as he loosened his other
hand and drew the sash across sir williams
mouth and tied it i got it from the

french last year you see it is long long
enough to bind your excellencys arms as
well as his mouth there now for the
feet this cord from the draperies seems

destined to meet my needs

  he leaped to the floor and in another
moment had securely fastened the feet
of the half-conscious governor to his chair
as he straightened -up and surveyed his
work his eyes clouded

  i require time he said thoughtfully
it might be that you will be able to utter
some sound before i have passed beyond
your reach this drapery will serve and
he tore it from a window

  as he was about to swathe sir williams
head and shoulders in the thick curtain he
stopped and smiled into the eyes that glared
into his

  it was great sport your excellency
he cried mockingly i have enjoyed this
afternoon and evening more than i had ever
expected to enjoy an entertainment the
bear-baiting your cavaliers seem to dote
upon never approached this for pine sport
and as for the noose of which you

boasted-

  he laughed softly and then flung the
curtain about the governors head and
shoulders binding it on with the long cord
from another drapery the work com-
pleted to his satisfaction he bent over so
that his lips were close to the governors ear

  if your excellency wishes me i will be
at the south sea he whispered some
of the kings own will surely be brave
enough to seek me there

  he laughed again and patted the shrouded
head

  thanks many thanks for an enjoyable
evening he said i only regret that it is
not possible for me to laugh aloud

  he walked across to the window opened
it and sprang out crouching keeping in
the shadows he made his way to the river

  dick jeffreys had not planned heedlessly
in the afternoon he had seen indians on
the streets of jamestown indians who he
knew had come by water he was certain
where they had beached their canoes and
five minutes after he had left government
house he was in one and headed up-stream
two hours later breathless for he had
paddled hard he drew in to shore at a
clump of sycamores as he stepped out
he listened a moment and then whistled
softly
before marquette



  dick cried a voice from the darkness
above him dick is it you oh dick
not so loud betsykins he whispered
as he climbed the bank to the girls side

  dick how did you get away has
the governor turned you free

  yes he answered as he sat down on
the bank and rocked back and forth hold- 
ing his sides and attempting sometimes
vainly to stifle his laughter

  betsy he finally said it was the most
comical time i have ever had the poor
old simpleton his fur trade is getting
away from him and he wants it back its
his perquisite from the king though the
colony is supposed to have granted him
alone the right to trade and now that
it is slipping he was willing to grant me
my head and my liberty forget my past if i
would but tame his indians and spy upon
the outlaw traders and dutch smugglers
then you are free the girl cried
ecstatically you will cease roaming and
-and talking so freely you will settle
down dick

  if i settle down betsykins it will be a
thousand leagues from virginia wait until
tomorrow the greatest roar that ever
came out of government house will be
heard as far back as the blue mountains

i wonder-i wonder- and he broke off
to indulge in another fit of silent laughter

  dick protested elizabeth dick
tell me what have you done
repeating at length and with inter-
lations his conversations with sir william
th in the afternoon and evening stopping
often to chuckle over his thrusts and their
reception by royalist ears and ending
with a detailed description of how his
excellency had appeared when he leaped
on to the table and squatted close to his
astonished face dick related what had
happened

  during the recital elizabeth carver
who had seated herself beside him on the
ground listened with increasing fear when
at last he had finished she did not speak
was too shocked too stunned too greatly
overwhelmed by the knowledge of what his
recklessness had brought upon his head

  i only wish dick himself broke the
silence that i could be a mouse beneath
the tavern floor and hear the wits of james-
town recount the affair if the wits or any
one else ever hear the true report from the
governors lips

  what are you going to do now asked
elizabeth in a strained unnatural voice

  lead sir williams trainbands a merry
chase for a week or so and then strike north
to the french settlements was the ready
answer theres the place for adventure
betsykins the savages are friendly ex-
cept the longhouses fur is plenty and
a man may live as he wishes without laws
teuing how to breathe as well as think
and she asked in a strained whisper
you will not come back

  to stick my head into sir williams
anxious noose to be told what i shall
eat and wear and plant and swear how i
shall pray and what price to pay ha
ha ha and again he held his sides in
an effort to stifle his mirth

  no no betsykins ive tasted the wine
of freedom and this virginia sack has
become bitter id feel like that panther
your brother tried to tame were i to remain
in the colony theres a wide land out
there to the north and west a land where
a man may think and live and speak as he
chooses where there never was a king and
his persecution and never will be where a
man can be himself and not the stayed
beruffted manikin the king and his court
would have him

a suppressed exclamation from

elizabeth brought a sudden stop to
dicks exuberance

  forgive me little friend he said
penitently i had forgotten that you are
the kings own royalist to the tips of your
pretty fingers but i couldnt resist the
opportunity to bait sir william there is
a zest in placing your head inside the lions
mouth and jerking it out before he can
snap his jaws and the thought of it is
so fresh i could not but tell of it oh
betsykins could you have but seen his
face even the daughter of so stanch a
cavalier as charles carver would have
laughed if not colonel carver himself
it-why betsy what is it forgive me
little friend ill tell no more of it

  for a moment he listened to the girls
sobs as she sat beside him in the darkness
beneath the sycamores her hands covering
her face the first twinge of remorse carne
to him silenced the laughter in a heart
whose thoughtless recklessness had turned
gray the hair of his father and had deprived
him though never to his regret of his place


adventure

in the cavalier aristocracy of virginia

  to dick jeffreys roamer playmate of
savages friend of outlaw traders there had
never been anything attractive in the
plantation life the summer his mother
had died when he was fourteen he had
first run away with the indians before
he was eighteen his father scandalized
stern demanding obedience had forbidden
him to come near the plantation and te
same night had sent a trusted overseer to
induce dick to return

  elizabeth carver seven years younger
boyhood playmate now at the dawn of
womanhood was still a playmate to the
careless dick still a companion as well as
the only person in the colony who dared
risk a word with him even as he sat
there in the darkness distressed by her
sobs accusing himself for having hurt her
she was still to him the little girl who had
joined so whole-heartedly in the games
he and her brother had arranged the same
stanch comrade the same worshiper of his
boyish escapades the years had passed
lightly with dick jeffreys and he thought
less of the passage of time with others

  he was altogether mystified then when
elizabeth suddenly lifted her head and said
coldly-

  you will never come back to virginia
  not while sir william is governor
  then i will never see you again

  i dont know betsy i never looked
that far ahead

  dick and her tone softened wont
you ever grow up

  some time when the fun of living begins
to grow less

  she was silent for a moment and then
she arose

  i suppose you are going on up the
river she said quietly i must leave now
they will wonder where i am

  yes i must be going the trainbands
will be on the trail soon and the forest will
be a bedlam with the bloodhounds turned
loose oh theyll press close to the blue
mountains and peer into every thicket
to find me its going to be great sport
beating them covering the trail doubling
playing the fox almost as much sport as
baiting sir william himself but i must
not give them too much time good-by

little-

suddenly the girl stepped close and
grasped his arm clung to him in a new terror

    dick she whispered its too late
 theyve cut you off

    he too had heard the sound of poimding
 hoofs on the road less than a hundred yards
 back from the river up and down every
 highway on every stream the hunters
 were spreading every plantation would
 have the news before morning every
 path every river every bit of cover would
 be watched searched guarded even the
 indians with promises of rum to spur them
 on would search for his footprints the
 bloodhounds eager after sniffing his cot
 in the gaol would scatter through the
 swamps and woods

   egad whispered dick they will
 give me a run for it

   you cant go elizabeth protested
 it is too late you are cut off on the river
 and on the land they are arousing your
 own fathers house even now listen
 dick there is only one way the cabin
 we built when we were children back of
 the tobacco sheds it is still there in the
 pines with its little attic which you ar-
 ranged for me to hide in when we played
 indian massacre no one ever goes near it
 or thinks of it wait here a few moments
 then go there ill see that you get food
 and water every day

    no no betsy he protested i cant
 hide behind a womans skirts ive started
 this- betsy

    he sprang forward but it was too late
 the girl had jumped down the bank and
 with one thrust of her strong young arms
 had sent his light canoe far out into the
 current

    it was the only way dick she panted
 as she turned to face him it was sure
 death to go on by water or by land
 they will never consider to look for you
 so near jamestown if they see that canoe
 theyll only think you took to the forest
 farther up the river in two weeks the
 search will be abandoned and you can get
 to the blue mountains in perfect safety
 he was silent for he knew that she spoke
 the truth but when he did attempt to speak
 she interrupted

    ill see that food and water are carried
 to you daily dick and when i know the
 search has been given up ill send you a
 musket and powder and ball that will
 be the signal that all is well that you may
 go now i say good-by

    choking back the tears striving to keep
before marquette



her voice steady she held out her hand
he dropped to one knee and pressed it to his
lips

  youre a jewel little betsykins he
whispered if you had only been a boy

  oh she cried as though in sudden
pain

  with an effort she regained control of
herself and when she did speak again it
was gently almost compassionately

  good-by dick she said i am
going to ask only one thing before you go
for i wont see you again please remember
that no matter where you go or what you
do no matter what you may now think
you believe or care about that always
always dick i will have faith that you will
never forget that you are the son of a
gentleman or that you are at heart a
gentleman yourself

chapter iii

beyond the blue mountains

cor more than a league dick jeffreys
-t had been pushing straight north
through the sand his feet slipped back-
ward with each step and their soles were
blistered from the heat of the open places
where the sun beat down with all its august
intensity his way led through scattered
patches of scrub oak sometimes hardly high
enough to afford shelter and across blister-
ing bare spots where no plant could find
nourishment

  its worse than the sands along the
shore of virginia and the carolinas he
panted and ive heard that the span-
iards country is like this and that it is easy
to die of the thirst there

  he stopped suddenly and dropped the
butt of his musket to the ground it was
not a halt of fear lest he had wandered into
the spanish possessions with their attendant
dangers of death by thirst or at the hands of
mexicos conquerors for dicks shoulders
shook and his face was contorted by his
efforts to suppress his laughter since
april he had not dared even sneeze hun-
dreds of leagues through an unknown land
four months of dodging strange savages
escapes innumerable had given him a cau-
tion he had not believed possible

  if i had done it he whispered when at
last he had mastered his mirth if after
baiting sir william in his own den and then


telling him he could look for me at the
south sea if he wanted to speak with me
though i had intended to strike in the oppo-
site direction for the land of the french if
after his offer of my life an i would find the
land of gold for his king and my laughing at
his offer if after all that i should run west
from these devilish conestogas and be
chased farther west by the still more devil-
ish eries and then west and north again by
savages who did not even permit me to stop
and ask their names-

  he stopped again a victim of his desire to
laugh and the tears were in his eyes when at
last he lifted his musket and started on
through the hot sand

  if after all that he whispered to him-
self i should blunder into this south sea
this red sea this gulf of california
wouldnt it be a joke on sir william

  he plunged and slipped through the sand
and brush unmindful of the labor of travel
and of the heat in his new-found amusement

  wouldnt it be a joke on sir william and
his king he continued in a whisper for a
man can not spend four months alone in the
wilderness without sometimes voicing his
thoughts aloud if i should find this fabled
sea and its gold and its rubies when i cant
go back to tell them of it for fear theyll
hang me theyd rather have their pre-
cious notions of divine right and the like
unbattered than all the wealth of the indies

  oh well they need not trouble them-
selves if i keep on far enough and long
enough and the savages are not too per-
sistent ill arrive in the land of the french
somehow and then heigh-ho a long life
and a merry one a free land and a kingless
one by winter ill be in my future home

  the character of the country had changed
suddenly as he talked to himself his eyes
were always moving up and down to this
side and that never missing a depression
of the sand or the possibilities of a particu-
larly dense thicket the shaking of a bit of
grass or the blue of the sky unmarred by a
whiff of smoke these precautions were
second nature as automatic and as neces-
sary to his continued existence as his res-
piration and the beating of his heart

  consciously however he had not seen
the opening ahead the sudden termination
of the scrub oak and other small growth
until he found himself at the base of a hill of
sand it rolled upward gently its surface
wrinkled by waves like those on a small


adventure

lake beneath a gentle breeze there was
no vegetation nothing except sand

  after a hasty survey of the country to the
right and left dick started up the long
slope from its crest he found a higher hill
of sand beyond and all about him the sun
beat down in scorching fury while from the
ground a heat almost as intense arose

  from the second hill there was nothing
to be seen except an ocean of rolling sand
sand hill after hill valley after valley and
all bare as water itself

  ill have one more look from that next
hill thought dick aloud its higher
and it may be that i can see to the end of it
if not ill turn back im so dry now im
cracking and theres no chance for water
in such a desert

  he climbed slowly to the top of the third
hill for his musket and pack were heavy
and the heat was becoming unbearable
as his feet slipped in the last few steps he
stopped suddenly and stared

  mon dicu as monsieur crapaud would
say were he in my place exclaimed dick
it is the sea the south sea the gulf of
california i started out to find the french
and i have found the spanish its back
ill have to turn for id rather risk the pine
splinters of the savages than the work of
those spanish devils

  before him stretching to the horizon at
the north and as far as he could see to the
east and west was a great sheet of blue
water between him and the shore the
sand sloped gradually to a huge crescent
beach he could see along this rim of sand
for leagues in both directions but nowhere
either on land or on the sea was there
evidence of human occupation

  spaniards or no spaniards im going to
say that ive been to the south sea though
why they should call it the red sea i fail to
understand i never saw water more blue
or more of it even in the western ocean for
that matter heres to say ive waded into
it

  he was still half a mile from the water
and the sand slipped and burned his feet
in the excitement of his discovery he had
forgotten his thirst for the moment but
now with so much water before him it re-
turned redoubled

  egad and i could drink it salt and all
he muttered as he trudged slowly on

  a short distance from the beach dicks
automatic habits of observation became

active and his mind began to turn over the
messages brought to him

  no surf though it is an open sea

  no tide marks

  no smell like that the sea is never
without

  he stopped at the waters edge

  thats strange he muttered

  then he suddenly lifted his musket above
his head and strode into the shallow water
which lay without movement as if prostra-
ted by the heat

  in the name of charles the second king
of england i claim this sea and all the land
bordering thereon he cried there
ive settled accounts with sir william
his desire is quenched now i must
quench my thirst

he laughed aloud for though
his parched throat made of the ef-
fort little more than a cackle there
was no one to overhear no savage to bring
his tribe upon him suddenly he stopped
and looked at the water between his feet
then he stooped cupjed his hand and
brought it dripping to his ups

  sweet he cried sweet as any nectar
though if i had eggs here i could boil them
in it this water is as warm as that of the
james though it is clear and pure

  he rinsed out his mouth several times let
a little trickle down his throat and at last
began to drink slowly from his cupped
hands

  no red sea or gulf of california is this
he said when he was satisfied and had risen
to look about him it is one of the great
lakes they told me of on the st lawrence
though which one i dont know how im to
learn but anyhow it is the land of the
french their traders have seen all five of
them and even now will be arriving with
their goods i have only to follow the
shores until i find traces of them and if i
do meet savages i need not fear theyll
never know me from a frenchman

  the conviction that he had reached one
of the five great lakes of which the french
had told him that he was at last in the land
he had sought when he had slipped out of
virginia four months before served to re-
vive him as much as the water he looked
toward the east and then the west and could
see no difference in the great curving beach

  one way is as good as another he said
im as sure of finding a frenchman on the
before marquette



left as the right and so long as ive been
traveling west and north ill keep on

  he turned to the left and started along
the hard sand close to the water it was a
little damp and consequently not so hot as
the desert through which he had toiled in
the morning the nearness of the water
too was a comfort while the fact that he
was a fair sight for any eyes within miles
did not concern him he believed he was
in a land where the savages were friendly
to the only white men they knew the
french and if he did encounter one he could
obtain some information as to the rendez-
vous of the traders

  though dick walked steadily all after-
noon he failed to find any traces of savages
or french he did come to the end of the
sand but only to find a low swampy country
with great stretches of coarse grass willows
bordering the shore and the whole apparent-
ly as lifeless as the dry desert he had
crossed at sunset he reached what ap-
peared to be a small island in the swamp a
higher bit of ground with elms and oaks
upon it and best of all a mother grouse
with a flock seeking a nesting-place for the
night in the branches of an oak

  dick waited patiently until dusk and then
swung himself up and began to whack at the
stupid birds with a light stick he knocked
down six of the eight and was assured of
supper and breakfast when the sun came
out of the sea in the morning he was ready
for the days march and so certain was he
that he had reached the land of the french
and friendly savages he started along the
shore with a light heart and lips parted in
song

  his course had been bending more and
more until by mid-forenoon he was going
almost straight north the low swampy
country continued but farther up the coast
he saw the beginning of higher ground and
beyond that high bluffs that rose from the
water at noon while still in the marsh
further progress was arrested by a river
it was too deep to ford and there was noth-
ing at hand with which to build a raft to
float across his few possessions while he
stood there undecided as to his course a
birchbark canoe swept around the bend
above him in it were three white
men

  a smile of contentment  his face for
the end of his four hazardous months had
come dick stood leaning on his musket

awaiting the strangers that they were
frenchmen he did not doubt men of no
other race had ever penetrated so far to the
westward even at that distance he could
distinguish their gray homespun clothing
the bright sashes without which no coureurs
de bois ever went into the wilderness and
their peculiar pudding-bag caps

  that they would be friendly dick was
equally confident most of them he knew
were outlaws like himself men who had
preceded even the jesuits into the far
places along the shores of the great lakes
men who traded with the savageswithout
that necessary permit from the king of
france recognizing no superiors no laws
no right save that of might and their own
inclinations daring the unknown wilder-
ness and the equally unknown temper of its
savage inhabitants their lives in tune with
the wild rapids of the rivers the fierce
storms of the lakes and the fiercer natures
of the natives they appeared to dick
jeffreys in all the romantic coloring with
which his imagination had clothed them
he need only tell them he knew that he
too was an outlaw a fugitive from the
wrath and stifling influence of kings and
they would accept him

  as he stood there the canoe came straight
down the center of the river the three
men had seen him as quickly as he had seen
them but had not missed a stroke of their
paddles nor had they in any way indicated
that they considered his presence unac-
countable

  when they were fifty paces away dick
lifted his right hand and called-bon

jour

  bon jour bon jour came a friendly
answer from the men in the bow and the
middle

  the stern paddler remained silent

  dicks mother had received a good educa-
tion in england before she had married
captain jeffreys and sailed for virginia
one of the tilings she had insisted upon
dick learning in his early boyhood was the
french language and his year in new
france had served to perfect him in the
tongue

  wait comrades he called give me
a moment of your time that i may know
whether i am at the gulf of california the
eastern ocean or only on one of the five big
ponds of the king of france

  the two men in the bow of the canoe


adventure

laughed outright but the one in the stern
demanded suspiciously-

  who are you

  i replied dick readily am like your-
self a rover of the forests a man without a
king without a home and without a care
and with the one desire-a glass of brandy
a comrade with whom to drink it and never
a blackrobe to repress my enjoyment of
either

  a coureur de bois like the rest of us
cried the bowman as he dug the water with
his paddle and pulled the canoe nearer
shore

 an englishman with too ready a
tongue retorted the stern paddler as he
pulled the craft the other way let us be
on to the nets

  come come basile objected the man
in the bow only yesterday you were
saying that there should be four of us that
we have too much for three since gabriel
found that brandy would not float him in
the last rapids of the mattawan we still
have far to go and are in need of a strong
back and another paddle another musket
too for that matter come friend get
into the canoe and well lift the nets and
then talk it over

  he had been pulling the craft closer to
shore and the bow touched the bank at
dicks feet

  of course there is no harm in talking of
it agreed the virginian

  we want men of our own blood in this
men we know growled the one addressed
as basile

  we know he is a man or he wouldnt be
here with a million savages between him
and his settlement and we care not of his
blood so that we are sure of the heart that
pumps it cried the bowman get in
friend

  basile remained silent though there was
an ugly look on his face dick glanced at
him smiled good-naturedly and stepped
into the canoe

  they did not speak as they shot down the
river under the impetus of four paddles
dick knew that here was his first opportu-
nity to prove himself and his spruce blade
bent with the force of his arms

  enough cried basile at last and with
a swirl of water they brought up at a stick
floating at the mouth of the river the net
was quickly overhauled and two score of
fish taken then their paddles snapping

briskly they turned up-stream the two
men in the forepart of the canoe broke into
a voyageurs song obscene and blasphe-
mous but with an air that quickened the
paddle strokes and seemed of its own buoy-
ancy to lift the light craft from the water
dicks body tingled with the thrill of it
swayed to its rhythm and when they broke
into the chorus the second time he joined
them joyously

  silence whispered basile fiercely as
they rounded a bend theres some one
at the cabine

  quietly now but as swiftly they went on
between the low marshy banks another
bend and they saw the river fork on a
bit of high ground between the two streams
a white tent gleamed against the willows
gliding in and out of the door shrieking as
they bore casks and bales of goods down to
their waiting canoes were a dozen savages

  those thieving miamis cried basile
at them

paddling fiercely swearing con-
tinuously searing oaths which dick
had never heard before the three
coureurs de bois shot their craft straight
toward the indians dick silent but with
leaping heart at this chance of a fray bent
his back as effectively as the others

  the canoe did not slacken speed as it
approached the bank one of the savages
in the act of shakily lifting a gourd to his lips
saw the white men and shrieked a warning
at the same instant the canoe struck and its
occupants rising to their feet with the last
stroke landed with an impetus that carried
them muskets swinging about their heads
to the door of the tent

  the savages had taken advantage of the
hours absence of the frenchmen and
though their brains were inflamed by the
liquid fire they had consumed they were
not able to convert their blood-thirsty de-
sires into action they swayed and tot-
tered as they gathered to meet the attack
and half of them went down in the first
rush three of these were on their feet
instantly however and when the four
white men faced about in front of their
tent they were met by a compact group of
gleaming brown bodies flashing knives
and swinging hatchets

  dick his musket whirling like a flail did
not wait for the attack but sprang forward
with an answering yell two savages
before marquette



went down before him but the impetus of the
heavy weapon carried him into the center of
the group and a knife slit open his buckskin
shirt and gashed his shoulder still he kept
his musket swinging with the result that
the group was divided and the three
frenchmen charging together swept one-
half before them into the river

  back they came to join dick who faced
the remainder the savages wavered and
then broke for their canoes

  get the goods cried basile as he dashed
after them unload the canoes first

  they pursued the fleeing party so closely
there was no time for embarking and as the
indians did not return to the attack the
white men unloaded the canoes and piled
the casks and bales of goods upon the bank

  in the meantime the five savages who
had been forced into the river had struggled
back to shore all the fight gone out of them
they held up their hands in token of sur-
render and basile nodded toward the ca-
noes the men filed past lifted their craft
into the water and stepped in

  basile began to speak quickly sharply
in miami a tongue not unlike some dick
had known to the east the indians who
had retreated up the river bank returned
and deposited their weapons in the canoes
the six of them filed past the tent to where
three of their comrades lay upon the ground
without examining the bodies to see
whether life had fled they carried them to
the canoes and dropped them in the
next moment their three barks were shoot-
ing down the river

  eh basile cried one of the french-
men joyously what do you think now
is he not one of us oh that was-a pretty
charge he made straight through the thick
of them come shake his hand

  dick had recognized in basile the leader
of the trio and from the first the mans
dislike had been evident as he faced
him now flushed from his exertions and by
the words of the frenchman he saw no
lessening in hostility rather it seemed
to be increased though now only basiles
eyes gave expression to his feeling the
mans evil face even broke into a forced
smile as he held out his hand

  you fought well and showed your
courage he said to dick as he stepped
forward to meet him i hold no objection
to your being one of us after we have had
time to hear your story it is a strange

thing an englishman so far from his
colony none has ever been here before
but no doubt you can explain it

  his tone was almost gracious but as
dick looked into his eyes he saw that the
words were empty that he need not seek
friendship there

   leon michel basile cried sharply as
 he turned to the others get down the
 river quickly and lift the net the savages
 wall be back with the darkness as soon as
 the brandy soaks out of them we must
 be off this cursed chicagon river and down
 the riviere des plaines before they can find
 us

   the impatience of his tone the peevish
 authority of it gave dick his first clew to
 the reasons back of the mans hostility
 he was the leader not only because of the
 happy careless attitude of the other two
 and their lack of initiative but because of
 his own superior mental qualifications
 and in the young virginian he recognized a
 rival one not amenable to discipline dick
 laughed outright and bowed to the french-
 man

  have no anxiety monsieur he said
i harbor no ambitions no aspirations ex-
cept to enjoy life as i find it

   see that you have no others growled
 basile as he turned away

chapter iv
one of us

dick jeffreys was left alone with

basile when leon and michel went
down the chicagon river to the lake to re-
cover their net the frenchmanwas busy
examining and arranging the goods with
which the indians had attempted to run off
and the virginian with his shoulder the
cut was only three inches long and little
more than through the skin when he had
bathed and bound it the canoe had returned
and all four immediately began prepara-
tions for departure

   there was no time for dick to ask ques-
 tions as to the plans of the party the
 miamis three of whom they knew were
 badly wounded if not dead would be back
 at night with a larger party and the urgent
 need was to get as far away as possible
 as to what part of the french country he
 had reached what the three coureurs de bois
 intended to do and the explanation of his


adventure

 own presence in the country all that could
 wait until a less strenuous time

  the two canoes of the party were soon
loaded and dick took the bow of one with
michel in the stern his shoulder was
irritated by the exertion of paddling but he
said nothing and their craft though heavily
loaded and propelled against the current
did not lag behind the other

  they paddled all afternoon without
stopping and the sun had set when at last
they turned ashore dick saw a well-
beaten path leading from the landing-place
out across a low prairie

  heres where the toil comes friend
cried michel as he arose stiffly from the
canoe

  the men began at once to unload

  we have a long start and can carry
across to the riviere des plaines before they
come half-way from the lake even should
they be on the right track said basile
but we must lose no time

  then began the first of many trips be-
fore the second load was portaged night had
fallen and through the darkness they toiled
back and forth bearing canoes bales of
goods and casks of brandy upon their
backs it was after midnight when the
last article had been carried across and
even then there was no rest the two
canoes were loaded and turned down-
stream and until after sunrise they jour-
neyed on into the southwest

  ah basile cried michel when the sun
was high we have left the country of the
miamis and must be in that of the islinois
where the thieves dare not follow let us
go ashore and eat and sleep

  basile turned his canoe toward a good
camping-spot they cooked a meal and
then all except leon stretched out in the
shade of some willows later michel was
wakened and stood guard and at noon they
were again in the canoes until darkness
descended upon the river basile did not per-
mit lagging and then after a hasty meal
all four dropped asleep in the long grass on
the bank

  the sun had risen high enough to be un-
comfortable before they wakened in the
morning and even then they only sought
shade and slept a little longer dick saw
that the frenchmen did not fear possible
pursuit by the miamis and that they were
in no huriy to go on

  he was glad of the opportunity not only

to rest but because they could now tell him
something of where he was where they were
going and what they intended to do he
was happy because he had reached the land
of the french because he had joined a band
of the courcurs de bois but his restless spirit
was not content with a mere following of
the life of these adventurers and he had
chosen to construe basiles hostility as a
challenge to the leadership of these free
spirits of the wilderness as he had noth-
ing to conceal and recognized the value of
frankness in cementing the friendship
which he knew he had gained with leon
and michel he chose the indolent hours of
the forenoon to tell of himself

  friends he began my coming among
you has seemed strange and it is as much to
me as to yourselves i will begin at the
beginning and tell of myself all that you
could care to know

  first my name is richard jeffreys
generally called dick which is the english
method of saying richard if one of that
name be a close friend my father is
captain jeffreys of the colony of virginia
in which i was born twenty-four years ago
had i followed precedent i would now be a
gay cavalier riding a good horse from plan-
tation to plantation dressed in silks and
satins and lace and gold a sword at my side
a dagger in my belt and never without a
quart of sack in my belly i would have
had slaves and a chest of money acres of
tobacco and possibly in time a seat in the
house of burgesses

  but you see i am not why because
in virginia a man may let his body wander
at will between tavern and plantation be-
tween bear-baiting and carousing while he
must leave his mind at home under a lock
and key furnished by the king he must
think as the king prescribes swear only as
much as the king permits go to church or
the gallows and even on his own land plant
what the king decides

  i chose to cramp my body within buck-
skin and let my mind wander to think and
swear and live as i willed and that is how
i am here

  and welcome you are exclaimed
michel without your swinging musket
there at the forks of the chicagon we might
have been dead men well broach a keg
to your health and the success of all of us

  there appears to be much still to be ex-
plained growled basile an englishman
before marquette

i

in new france smells to me too much of a
spy

  listen further replied dick amiably
and answering the leaders hostile glance
with a smile i was about to explain
all

  he told of his boyhood how he had ac-
quired a desire for the forests rather than
the settlements through his early associa-
tion with the savages of how he had gone
north through the land of the delawares
through the colony of the dutch the land of
the mohicans and finally to the st
lawrence where he had spent a winter
with a trader licensed by the french king
from tales he had heard there he had first
become enamored of the life of the coureurs
de bois in that great and little-known land
to the westward on the shores of the five
great lakes

  and who was that trader asked basile
sharply and with a cunning smile for leon
and michel

  his name was simon bouisson an-
swered dick readily and he traded to the
westward of quebec

  simon bouisson shouted michel in
glee and how friend did this mon-
sieur bouisson appear

  i have never been in your paris but i
imagine that the gargoyles on one of the
famous buildings are not at all unlike
simon answered dick

  leon and michel rolled upon the ground
in the excess of their mirth and even basile
joined in the laughter

  but he said you have still to explain
how you from the colony of virginia could
reach the southern shore of the lake of the
islinois or lac mecheygan as some call it
when the land of the longhouses lies direct-
ly between the iroquois are not in the
habit of letting any one wander at will
through their domain

dick began a complete account of
his interview with sir william
berkeley and his escape from the
gaol michel and leon broke in several
times with their laughter and applause
but basile as dick gained favor with the
others became more dour of expression

  without a reference to elizabeth carver
and her part in his escape the young
virginian related how he had started north-
ward to gain the delawares country only
to be driven in his canoe up the potomac

to escape a hostile band of paspaheghs he
was pursued far and at last took to the
woods in the blue mountains to wander
westward until he came to a river which he
had seen before and which the savages
called the monongahela the chance dis-
covery of a canoe permitted him to descend
this stream for a long distance without en-
countering any one

  as this route took him north and straight
toward the iroquois country he began to
have misgivings when the stream was
joined by another and the one current at
last set off toward the southwest a stream
rapidly increasing in size and the most
beautiful he had ever seen when dick
described its lower reaches and the savages
from whom he escaped michel broke in
with the explanation

  that is the river the iroquois call the
ohio which means something like broad and
beautiful farther west it is known to the
savages as the ouabashe one of the
kings men from montreal named la
salle traveled on it a ways some seasons
ago had you kept on if the reports of
the savages be true you would have come
to the great water the one the savages to
the west speak of as the misisepe

  and i would have been there long ere
this had it not been for some red devils i
encountered they saw me and gave
chase and i turned into a big river that
flowed in from the north and went up it for
more than a hundred leagues then one
night some knaves who from the dress or
lack of it must have been brothers to the
miamis who attacked us on the chicagon
got between me and my canoe i slipped
away in the night working north for i
knew the french were in that direction
and at last came out on what you have
called lac mecheygan only the day before
i saw you i believed it was the sea until
i tasted it

  and now what asked basile sharply
as you have seen and as you have
heard replied dick with a smile i can
not go back to the english colony death
is certain there since i spent a year in
new france i have wished to lead the life
of the coureurs de bois it appeals to me
freedom of thought and action of mind
and body no law no rulers risks but
no cares a pleasant land and more pleasant
companions why are you yourself a
ranger of the forests monsieur basile


adventure

  but i am french in the land of the
french

  dick turned to the others with a smile
does the king of france claim this
land he asked does he know it is here
i am sure that you have never taken re-
ports to montreal of what you know of it
ha ha basile cried michel he
scored there we found this land beyond
the lac mecheygan and we do not intend
to give it to any king why should we rim
the risks for fat loafers in europe no
monsieur dick is right and he is one of us
it makes no difference if he is english he
has the soul of the forest-rangers and that
is enough for us eh leon

  i care not if he be dutch or spanish
after the way he charged the miamis
agreed leon we started with four we
will end with four let monsieur dick
have gabriels share hell earn it before
we are through

  basiles face had become black as the
others spoke but before he could voice his
protest dick who had been watching him
closely interrupted

  i will not permit such generosity he
declared it is not right and i do not
wish it it is the life not the profits i
crave only let me continue with you
sharing in the labor and the risks and i am
content then the next year perhaps
he is as fair and generous as he is brave
cried michel come basile iron out
your face monsieur dick is to be one of
us

  one of us always agreed leon

  the days went by wonderful days for
the virginian never before had he seen
so fair a country the river flowed gently
between prairie banks trees bordered
the stream and wandered in patches and
long lines out on to the plains the sun
shone brightly inviting indolence the
breezes over the land were sweet and fresh

  each day they dropped a little farther
down the stream before long they en-
tered a larger river the river of the islinois
dick was informed though none of the
frenchmen and no white men before them
had ever been so far

 they feasted as they went wild
turkeys were in the trees raspberries
were ripe and the three frenchmen showed
dick how to dig and boil the prairie apple
which tasted to the virginian much like the
potato of the colonies deer grazed about

them in herds fish of many kinds were
plentiful in die water they saw too for
the first time the pisikous the bceufs sau-
vage or wild cattle dick had never heard
of these animals though the other three had
known of the huge beasts through savage
reports and their first encounter brought
consternation to all four

  no longer than domestic cattle but twice
the size with great humps on their shoulders
and massive heads in which beady eyes
were set beneath black curving horns and
in the midst of a wealth of brown curling
hair they roamed the plains in great herds
their size their numbers and the ferocious
appearance of the males sent the four men
in terror to their canoes when first en-
countered later leon killed one and after
they had tasted the tongue and the meat of
the hump and bands of the animals were
seen every day they were accepted as
merely one of the bounties of this un-
dreamed of land

from the beginning dick fell
easily into the indolent careless
untrammeled life of his companions
for hours each day and always in the eve-
ning they lay in the shade or beside a fire
and told tales experiences and adventures
in far strange places among stranger people
in wildernesses where no white men had
ever been before history has given to
some men the distinction of being first in
various places but in the land of the great
lakes and beyond both to the west and
north the coureurs de bois seeking adven-
ture freedom and opportunities for illicit
trade with the indians far outstripped the
emissaries of the king of france and the
courageous jesuits

  dick caught at once the significance of
these stories it was well among them-
selves to tell of far places but a whisper of
them on the st lawrence meant prison and
perhaps worse he learned that leon la
gard with one companion had penetrated
the rich fur country to the north of lac
superior the greatest and the most distant
of the great lakes that michel charon had
gone west from the same lake until he had
passed the forest and come to a great plain
that basile pombert had gone south from
lac mecheygan past uie ouabashe or the
ohio of the iroquois until he had found
savages with muskets obtained from the
spaniards of la floride
before marquette



  but this red sea this gulf of california
this land of gold and precious stones have
any of you seen it or been near it asked
dick his imagination inflamed by the
stories

  who knows answered leon with a
shrug of his shoulders perhaps this very
river of the islinois enters it perhaps to-
morrow we will be floating upon salt water
along the western shore of lac mecheygan
all along the shores of lac superior always
the savages speak of the misisepe the
michisepe the great water as the algon-
quin tongue expresses it a land of strange
people of huge monsters and fiery demons

  i have never known any who have been
to it though some have informed me that
they have been told that its waters are salt
once south of lac superior when among
the outaouacs and the hurons who were
pursued there by the iroquois on a river
they called le noir or the black i was
told that if i kept on down-stream i would
come to the misisepe i would have gone
but it was late in the season

  there is a blackrobe even now at
michilimakinac called marquette said
michel who plans to go to this misisepe
we stopped there on our way to the chica-
gon river and he asked us many questions
about where we had been and what we have
heard of the place he has an idea it is a
river from what he told us and that it flows
into the gulf of california even now he
awaits orders from his superior to go to look
for the great water next year and he ex-
pects the governor of new france to send a
man to accompany him then theyll
claim it for the king

  and you who have been farther than
the others you and the other coureurs de
bois have you never claimed what you
have found asked dick from the lac
mecheygan and lac superior westward it
is any mans land any kings open to the
first who sees and claims it

  we claim it for our own for what that
claim be worth answered michel why
should we take it for a king the kings
men and the kings laws would come in and
drive us out for our pains there is enough
land to the east for the fawners for the men
with kings licenses and favors for the faint-
hearts who dare not go beyond the sight of a
plowed field or sound of church bells for
those who fear they might die unshriven
this land is for us who dare come to it and

it will remain ours if we can keep the black-
robes and others back this marquette
learned nothing from us that will be to his
advantage and if we can first see some of
the savages on his route we may keep him
out altogether

  no monsieur dick remember that
you are to forget all that you see and hear
a discreet tongue is the sign of the coureurs
de bois

  he has already shown that his tongue is
loose interrupted basile fiercely i have
known from the first that there was no good
in an englishman coming into this land
an englishman is too greedy to seek only
adventure his knees are too weak from
bending to a throne to carry him so far into
savage country merely to gain freedom
leon michel did you not see his eyes
gleam when he asked of the red sea and its
gold and rubies did you not catch the
tone of his voice when he wanted to know if
this land of ours has been taken in the name
of a king

  i tell you this monsieur dick is an
english spy a man who came into our
country to take it for his own king there
was talk of it and fear of it when we were
on the st lawrence this spring now we
know it

  as basile spoke he had risen to his feet
his rage choked him toward the end and at
last his eyes gleaming evilly he drew a
knife and rushed at dick who still lay upon
the ground

  basile was thick heavy much older than
the virginian and he had used a knife be-
fore despite his rage his attack was not
without planning dick seeing him come
would attempt to rise to defend himself
in that defenseless position the knife would
descend

  but dick only pretended to rise in-
stead he rolled into a ball and flung himself
at basiles feet as the frenchman
sprawled headlong he himself sprang up and
after him

  they had been lying at the edge of a bank
six-feet high a deep pool directly beneath
them basiles fall had carried him close
to the brink and dick with a push of his
foot sent him flying out into the water

  leon and michel had taken no part in the
affair but now as dick stood there laughing
at the antics of basile as he rose to the sur-
face they suddenly sprang to their feet

  the savages they cried in a low tone


adventure

together see over the river the
islinois we have been seeking

  dick looked across the stream on the
farther bank standing in the shade of some
willows were two score or more of indians

chapter v

the islinois

leon la gard ran at once to dicks
j side

  no more fighting he whispered pre-
tend it was only merriment

  he bent over the bank up which basile
pombert his knife still in his hand was
climbing to return to the attack

  fool leon hissed look across the
river we have reached the islinois they
are watching us climb the bank and pre-
tend you were only having sport with
monsieur dick

  basile turned and saw the indians for the
first time instantly his rage vanished and
the angry glint in his eyes was succeeded by
a covetous gleam that to dick was even
more sinister than the frank hatred to which
he had become accustomed

  your hand dick he cried suddenly
help me up and laugh all of you michel
come and join us all of you clasp
hands and circle round theyll think it is
a dance to end our sport

  laughing uproariously kicking their
heels as they spun about the four joined
hands and whirled madly for a moment
then they swung into line and faced the
indians across the stream

  the calumet michel whispered basile
and michel went to a pack and took out a
long-stemmed pipe which he filled with
tobacco

  now directed basile you and dick
get into a canoe and take it to their chief to
smoke then bring him and one or two
others back their tongue is much like
that of the other savages we know and you
can speak with them

  michel directed dick into the stern of the
canoe and himself stood in the bow bearing
the pipe aloft the frenchmen seemed to
have no fear whatever of this strange peo-
ple who undoubtedly had never seen white
men and the virginian accepting their be-
lief in the friendliness of the natives pad-
died vigorously toward the opposite shore
as they approached michel holding the

mouth-piece of the pipe toward the savages
one of them detached himself from the group
beneath the trees and stepped toward the
bank straight tall naked except for a
few ornaments his brown skin gleaming in
the sunshine his face expressionless the
chief stood there in all the dignity with
which the indian was once able to en-
shroud himself

  the bow of the canoe touched the bank
and michel stepped out with flint and
steel he deftly lighted the tobacco in the
stone bowl as the chief placed his lips to the
mouth-piece and puffed michel smoked
others came forward and the pipe went the
rounds

  not a word was spoken not even a whis-
per was heard in the closely packed group of
indians when dick and michel looked at
them they seemed to be at ease uncon-
cerned but their curiosity could not be en-
tirely hidden and several times the vir-
ginian on turning quickly surprised stares
of amazement

  the ceremony of the pipe completed
michel indicated to the leader that he was
to enter the canoe and cross the river he
did so without hesitation and in a few
minutes was being courteously welcomed
by basile and leon

  it was with difficulty that dick repressed
his excitement it had been his hope upon
leaving virginia that he could work north
to the st lawrence and enter the fur trade
in time he hoped to become one of the
coureurs de bois to penetrate that amazing
country to the west of which such strange
stories were heard to go on with some ad-
venturous companions into new lands
among new people to be the first some-
where

  now as a result of his misfortunes of the
spring and early summer he had been
driven far to the west only to encounter at
once the very men he had sought and in the
first weeks to be with them the first white
men in a new wilderness the first to see
these nations that possessed a land so fer-
tile and abundant in all that one could wish

  he looked forward eagerly to the out-
come of the present ceremonies which he
knew so delighted the savage heart to the
establishment of friendly relations with
these people and the development of a pros-
perous trade as for his trouble with
basile he gave it little thought he knew
that the frenchman because of cleverness
before marquette



and love of power had won to leadership
over the careless easy-going leon and
michel dick himself had been a favorite
with these two from the beginning and a
certain aggressiveness and confidence had
aroused in basile the fear of a rival

  it was this that lay at the bottom of the
frenchmans charges of spying that had
prompted his attack that morning dick
in no way feared basile settlement of the
question of supremacy between the two was
inevitable and its hazards were part of the
life he sought if basile fired by hatred
could let the matter drop in the presence of
the real business of the party dick could do
as well accordingly he turned his whole
attention to the ceremonies now being en-
acted

  first basile made the chief a present of a
steel knife exhibiting its keenness and hard-
ness the savages eyes glowed with pleas-
ure and continually he tried the edge with
his thumb laughing outright when too much
pressure caused a deep gash

  then he was given a hatchet the blade
of which was as sharp as that of the knife
basile who had quickly taken note of the
stone-tipped arrows stone knives and horn-
pronged war club of the chief made the
most of the superiority of die steel

  while the presents were being tested and
admired dick glanced across the river to dis-
cover that every savage had disappeared
as he searched the bank expecting some
ruse and realizing their helpless position
should the indians become hostile he
learned the reason down-stream and
moving across the plain toward the river
like a cloud shadow only darker and mak-
ing a noise like distant thunder was a great
herd of bteufs sauvage

  basile cried dick as he picked up his
musket see ill now show them what
powder can do

  he leaped down the bank pushed off the
canoe and paddled quickly toward the ap-
proaching herd in midstream he caught
sight of some of the band hiding behind a
fringe of willows at a point near which the
buffalo would reach the river he landed
and joined them his musket ready

  the islinois arrows ready bows half-
drawn were intent upon the game until the
white man strode in among them at first
his coming caused some resentment but
dicks confident expectant attitude his
calm assurance and manner of holding what

they knew must be some sort of weapon
aroused curiosity almost forgetfulness of
the game they gathered near him looked
at his hair his skin his eyes and not with-
out amusement at his weapon if weapon it
could be then one of them gave a low hiss
and all turned to see the edge of the herd
sweeping close to the shelter

  immediately dick stepped out not an
indian followed nor was an arrow loosened
all gazed in wonder at this hunter who so
exposed himself who stood as if looking at
the game in idle curiosity as they
watched the virginian suddenly lifted the
musket to his shoulder a roar followed
smoke rolled forth in a cloud when it
lifted a monster bull lay on the ground
kicking in his death agony

  with a bow to the hunters and a magnan-
imous wave of his hand toward the quarry
dick walked back toward his canoe and
paddled across the stream

  bravo cried michel as he landed a
master stroke monsieur dick we could
see you plainly and you should have been
here to watch the chiefs face he had no
more than grasped what you had done than
we presented him with a musket and he has
invited us down to the village its only
two leagues down the stream and we start at
once mon dieul what a haul we will
make we havent broached a cask and
when we do

  trying vainly to repress his emotions the
frenchman danced gaily back to his com-
panions beside the chief that worthy
arose as dick approached and held out his
hand he spoke a few words most of
which dick grasped because of their simi-
larity to other algonquin tongues

  come boys commanded basile two
of you take the chief across now so that he
can talk with his men then bring him
back and well take him to the village in one
of the canoes these people never use
boats and it will please him to ride upon the
water

  dick and michel paddled the chief across
the river where his men crowded about him
in an excited jabbering group each trying
to be first to handle the mysterious weapon
their leader so proudly displayed he is-
sued a few brief directions and then re-
turned

  back at their camp the four white men
loaded their canoes rapidly and then the
chief reposing in state in the center of the


adventure

craft paddled by basile and leon they
turned down-river accompanied by the
shouting excited savages on shore

in little more than an hour
the village strung along the right
bank of the river was reached
the noisy escort had announced their com-
ing long before and the shore was crowded
with women children and old men

  thats good michel whispered to dick
with quick relief when he saw the small
number of cabincs the forty hunters are
all the men of the village which means there
wont be too many to handle

  you dont expect trouble surely after
the friendly manner in which they received
us do you asked the virginian

  there is always trouble when a savage
and brandy get together i have heard
that there are more than a hundred thou-
sand of these people who are the richest
and most powerful of any nation the french
have met excepting always the longhouses
they grow big fields of corn and roots and
melons and squashes there is game enough
for four times as many on these plains and
it is said that they never know what famine
is as is so often the case with the nations
to the north these people sow their crops
and then go out for game come home and
harvest what they have planted and then
they go for the big winter hunt that is
what the other savages have said of them
and it is known that they always live in
plenty

  the canoes were landed and when dick
climbed the bank he saw that michel had
not stretched the truth compared with
the northern indians especially those in
the country beyond the st lawrence these
were indeed a pleasant people in a land more
pleasant than he liad ever dreamed of
as he passed through the throng lie was
impressed by the courtesy of their manner
their happiness and contentment as ex-
pressed in sleek bodies and smiling faces
old and young they seemed like happy
frolicking children sincere in their welcome
to the white strangers

   dick in his attitude toward life was little
more than a child himself and not only be-
cause he knew that a quick way to an in-
dians heart is through his child but be-
cause this scene of contentment had cap-
tivated his spirit he picked up a naked little
boy and tossed him into the air again and

again at first the child was frightened
but against dicks infectious smile its terror
was powerless and when at last he swung
the youngster to his shoulder and strode off
through the village the child fastened his
fingers in his hair and chattered with
delight

  here growled basile as dick re-
turned to the shore wed not have a
thread of anything left if we all ran off and
left these savages to do as they wished with
the canoes you and michel stay here and
guard them while leon and i have a talk
with the chief we must see what they
have to trade before we go further

  dick set the child down and joined
michel

  you have a gay heart said the coureur
de bois but there is always a time in life
when one must be serious and we have
reached it now the chief desires to send
off runners to inform another village down-
river of our arrival but we dont want any
more than we have here and not these
unless it be worth our while

  dick did not reply it was not this
unusual seriousness of the ordinarily care-
free michel that silenced him but some-
thing sinister in the cold calculating meth-
ods of the frenchmen to the virginian
trade with the savages meant an exchange
of goods for fur and food if these indians
did not have much they could trade for
what there was and go on to the next
village why need fear greater numbers of
such friendly happy contented people

  he reviewed these amazing plans and ac-
tions as he sat on the bow of the canoe but
the memory of his happy hours with michel
and leon forced him to the conclusion that
basile with his scheming his evil mind
alone was at the bottom of any possible
knavery the other two indolent light-
hearted unaspiring were merely tools in
the older mans hands

  for the first time since he had joined
them dick entertained a serious thought
and it was in the resolution that he would
give basile cause for his jealousy that he
would wrest the leadership from this vil-
lainous frenchman

  as he came to this decision leon ran
down to the canoes

  its good news he cried they have
a wealth of beaver skins and many of
smaller animals besides dozens of fine speci-
mens of the robes of the baeufs sauvage
before marquette



basile has dissuaded the chief from sum-i
moning the next village and we are to begin
trading at once out with the bales boys
all but the casks theyll wait until to-
night

  the three began to unload the canoes
basile and the chief soon joined them and
the goods were arranged on the bank
more presents were made to the leading
men of the village and then the trading
began

  at first dick was inclined to be a little
ashamed of the values given and received
but he forgot it in the expression of happi-
ness upon the faces of the savages and in
the reflection that the frenchmen had
brought the goods safely through more
than six hundred leagues of wilderness

  he and michel were set to work baling
the furs received and for the remainder of
the day he had little time for anything else
at sunset the goods were exhausted and the
indians still had many furs basile looked
at the others and leon and michel nodded
a cask was immediately brought from the
canoes and broached basile let a little
into a gourd and passed it to the chief ex-
plaining that it was the strong water of the
french of which he undoubtedly had heard
from other savages that it made the sun
shine and the rain cease the heart gay and
the feet light

  the chief took a swallow and then
clutched his throat in sudden fear as the
potent liquor scorched and choked him
then as it reached his stomach and
warmed it he patted his abdomen and a
smile spread over his face

  again basile held the gourd toward him
and again the chief drank this time greed-
ily despite the burning sensation in his
throat the remainder was offered to one
of the warriors who downed it at a gulp
and then grinned sheepishly when the
others laughed at the distortions of his face

  basile who evidently had quickly per-
fected himself in the slight change to the
islinois tongue now spoke to the chief at
some length the leader who was most
evidently feeling the effects of the brandy
listened for a moment caught the meaning
of what the frenchman was saying and
tfien turned to his people to whom he
talked rapidly

  immediately there was a scramble of men
hurrying to the cabins dick who be-
cause he was busy and because of his un-
familiarity with this new branch of the
algonquin tongue had not understood the
exact meaning of all that was said was
amazed to see them come running back
their hands full of bows arrows spears war
clubs stone knives and weapons of every
conceivable sort basile in the meantime
had unloaded the casks and the savages
dumped the village arsenal into the two
canoes

  why are we doing this demanded
dick when he and michel at basiles com-
mand had paddled the two canoes across
the river and emptied their contents upon
the opposite shore

  to save our own precious heads from
being split open tonight was the laughing
reply such a sight as you shall see
dick and such a haul as we shall make

  but why should we not leave the
weapons in the canoes asked the vir-
ginian who now understood that more
brandy was to be given to the savages but
that the frenchmen fearing violence from
the liquor-aroused natives had made this
arrangement for their own protection

  because well need the canoe my
friend was the reply and see that you
do not take too much of the brandy your-
self we will need good heads and nerves
and stout arms too for there will be
leagues and leagues of paddling before we
sleep again

and arrer has rasped us raw

  magpie is the sheriff of our county and
im his deputy me and that scantling-
shaped hombre have been pardners ever
since gold was discovered on bedrock and
this is the first rift in our lute of course
there has been discords but this is the first
time that the strings have all been busted

  love cometh at strange times me and
magpie have been over in the medicine
hills sort of looking for an alleged rustler
and are coming out when we sees a nesters
cabin with smoke coming out of the stove-
pipe its an old place and aint been
occupied for some time so we decides to
investigate

  were a heap hungry and when we gets
in shooting range we smells fried onions and
coffee theres an aroma of biscuits on the



air too which dont hurt our noses none

  we pilgrims into the yard and as we
slips off our broncs the door opens and we
sees our hearts desire shes a cute little
filly shes slender got a lot of eighteen-
carat hair and blue eyes as big as the end
of a shotgun shell

  shes got a bowl full of dough in her
hands and she stares at us like were
curiosities sudden-like she smiles

  im sheriff simpkins states magpie
removing his hat

  she gives a queer little squeak and drops
her bowl on the ground

  i aint done nothing says she sort of
vacant-like

  maam the queen can do no wrong
states magpie we smells the odors of
araby so our noses brings us hither
onions says she dont they smell
perfume of the gods says i id
wear one all the time if it wasnt for the
looks of the thing im your obedient
servant ike harper you living here

woman i hope there aint no objection to
me using this cabin ill take care of it

  and in case hes too busy ill come
says i hes a busy man im sorry he
was so quick to startle yuh and make yuh
bust your dough mug hes abrupt that-
away
loco or love	

  no matter says she wont yuh
come in

  just wouldnt we say them onions
was the greatest and the biscuits was the
lightest yuh ever seen coffee nectar of
the gods there aint much furniture in
the place but what is in there looks home-
like shes got a enlarged picture on the
wall the same of which seems familiar

  maam says magpie pointing at it
would yuh mind telling me who the dis-
tinguished-looking gent is

  was says she sad-like hes gone
and-

  magpie says i dont presume on
short acquaintance to stir up sad memories
there dont seem to be nothing sacred to
him maam

  she smiles at us sweet-like and nods
yes hes gone but his memory lingers
he was a good man

  you dang well know he was agrees
magpie if he wasnt his picture wouldnt
be on your walls what did you say your
name was

  i didnt say mister simpkins i am
lily lester

  some pretty name call me magpie-
pleased to meet yuh

a while and see how youre making it

  do it says she id love to have

  she thanks us-i dont know what for-
and we rides away we pilgrims off across
the hills towards piperock and we takes
looks at that cabin until were out of
sight

  ike lily is a lulu states magpie

  if thats an expression of admiration i
remains torpid but if that apellation of lulu
reflects on the lady in any way i resents it
a heap

  get a dictionary ike he grins lulu
is a latin word meaning wonderful aint
she a wonder biscuits onions ike i
wish youd ask her for her recipe for cooking
coffee i sure admire coffee that i dont
have to chew and what wont corrode my

insides at each meal i wonder if she con-
templates future matrimony she dont
need to live alone ike reckon i aint
beyond matrimonial redemption myself
what do yuh think

   if yuh dont like the way i cook coffee
magpie you can cook it yourself and as
far as matrimony and you are concerned
youd be like a three-legged turtle trying to
catch a scared wolf there aint nothing
about you to catch the female fancy

  in the first place youre too long no
woman wants to look up a lodge-pole all
her life an occasional glance at your face
aint going to hurt nobody but as a steady
diet-no

   faces he states aint so much brains
and companionship counts a heap more
you suffers a heap that-away ike youre
pretty in the face-like a buffalo and
about as companionable as a porkypine but
when it comes to brains you aint got a
trump ill likely ride her way very
soon

  me too likely tomorrow

  yes and likely yuh wont ike he
snorts youre working for me sabe
you goes where i sends yuh

  if you think for a holy minute that i
aint going to have  leisure time magpie
you think again you get too cocky old-
timer and ill quit or take a vacation
sabe

  dont fly off the handle ike he ad-
vises nobody ever said yuh couldnt
have no leisure time you hops off half-
cocked also youre contrary did yuh
ever hear about the dog what got in the
manger he couldnt eat the hay and he
wouldnt let the bronc eat it

  if you figures yourself as the bronc in
that moral magpie you lose your ears
are too long old-timer where do yuh get
the idea that i cant get the lady i made
a living before i met you the only thing
i ever done that i was ashamed of was the
day i pinned your star on my bosom you
thinks just because youre a sheriff youre
better than most folks you didnt grab
any honors when you beat shep allen for
sheriff hes blind in one eye and string-
halted in both legs just let me whisper
something to you magpie if you dont

grab some of these cow thieves-

  ike you can desist im doing all that
a mortal man can do if i had a deputy
that was worth a cuss id-

adventure

       thats a sample of our conversa-
tion on the way home being
pardners for so long we hates to
say hateful things to each other but in a
case like this the truth does seep out we
gets real personal before we gets to pipe-
rock and finds zeb abernathy and scenery
sims setting in front of our office waiting
for us

  zeb looks just like youd bet he would
after hearing his name but no name on
earth could give an impression of scenery
when i look at him i think thusly

  the person what built you scenery
must a run mighty short of material they
looks yuh over and says-it aint much of
a man but ill put a squeak in it so growed-
up folks wont step on it accidental-like
they looks up at us as we rides in zeb
almost unjoins his neck trying to expecto-
rate across the street crosses his legs and
squints-

  any news magpie

  hello zeb says magpie nothing
new heard anything

dog-gone thing got absolutely robbed i
been telling everybody that we aint got
no protection around here whole sheriffs

cards aint yuh going to do nothing

magpie looking down at scenery you
keep your squeak in your chest and let zeb
tells us about it what happened zeb
while you fellers are picking flowers

throws down on the cashier with a gun and
lopes off with the treasure he told the
cashier to give you his regards what yuh

  cry a little says magpie tired-like
i dont reckon there is much else to do

yell come here ye outlaws and theyll
come a-running

  what i want to know is what are yuh
going to do squeaks scenery when

we elects yuh sheriff-

  they corrects magpie you voted

  then i got something to be proud of
im glad that folks cant hold me respon-
sible for you

  him and zeb ambles off up-town and we
goes inside

  there aint no joy in being a sheriff
yelps magpie throwing his boots over in
the corner your duty sort of keeps yuh
from pulling a gun and acting free-like
im going out tomorrow and get that bad
bad-man ike you watch me

  the next morning he shaves careful-like
and greases his boots

  going to try and make a mash on him
i asks you ought to have some per-
fume magpie you look like a bride-
groom

  ike says he ignoring the compliment
i wants you to ride up to sullivan gulch
and see if anybodys living there we got
to locate something or somebody pretty
soon

  where you going i asks

  into the breaks between here and the
circle-cross

  i rides out of piperock with joy in my
heart cause im going in the general direc-
tion of my hearts desire and magpie has
gone the opposite what do i care for
outlaws duty to me is self-preservation

  me and magpie meets at the door we
nods like distant relatives and each knocks
on our side of the door the lady makes
us welcome and we sets down

  im so glad to see yuh says she and
magpie walks plumb across the room to
shake hands with her

  i wish id a known yuh was coming
today she states id a had yuh bring
me some stuff from town

  well maam says magpie if theres
anything yuh want i can send ike after it

  i aint got no time says i im headed
for sullivan gulch id love to do it

deliver it right to your door

  me and magpie pilgrims back to pipe-
rock in silence buys the stuff for the lady
and goes down to the office

  we finds buck masterson on the steps
loco or love



  howdy buck says magpie what
can i do for yuh

  well unless you improves your ways i
dont reckon yuh can do anything says
buck sort of helpless-like i been
robbed

  pshawl says i how comes that
buck

  feller-same one what robbed the bank
i reckon-comes into my saloon this morn-
ing sticks a gun in my face and annexes
what i got in the safe said he knowed the
sheriff was away say magpie what in
-are you doing sending out proclama-
tions of your absence

  i dont care to listen to no such conver-
sation so i goes inside and pretty soon
magpie and buck pilgrims up-town i
takes that stuff throws it on a hoss and
points for the lady of my dreams

t- i gets almost to her place when
magpie overtakes me we rides
up deposits the stuff and partakes
of a light lunch

  im a outlaw-hunter states magpie
during the meal its a precarious ex-
istence fraught with much danger and
takes a man of nerve

  romantic says she and what does
mister harper do

  he holds my bronc

  while you runs says i magpie dont
want to be bothered with no bronc when
he gets scared maam if i was the sheriff
of this county id keep her swept clean of
outlaws believe me it irks me some to
take orders when i know they aint getting
us no place

  do you suppose im in any danger liv-
ing here alone she asks

  if i thought you was i couldnt sleep
orates magpie you need the protection

of a man if you-

  you hadnt ought to be here alone i
states of course id love to stay here
with you but-theres a preacher in pipe-
rock maam

  preachers aint no protection states
magpie being sort of a legal guardian

of this here county id admire to-

  magpie you aint got no time i re-
minds him you got to investigate that
bank robbery and the one in bucks place
youve said yourself that i aint no help to
you why dont yuh appoint me to look
fater the weaker sex in this county

  ike after knowing you as long as i have
id hate to call em the weaker sex

  oh im not afraid she states as
long as ive got two big strong men looking
after me i feel safe i do hope you can
come often cant you come tomorrow
i can says magpie of course ike
will have to stay and tend to the office rou-
tine work it aint much but its got to be
done

  routine work says i to magpie as
we pilgrims back what routine mag-
pie

  seeing that nobody breaks into jail
without showing a warrant he grins
pretty soon he heaves a long sigh and turns
in his saddle-ike it aint going to be
long before youll be cooking grub for your-
self alone

  it sure aint i agrees i begins to-
night your feller-feelings are paralyzed
magpie simpkins and no more do i cook for
an ungrateful hombre like you dang your
slim soul you aint noways good enough
for that lady

  aint it true he agrees but im
getting better all the time ike didnt
yuh notice how the tears comes to her eyes
and how her breast heaved when i spoke
about losing sleep and then you-dang
yuh you has to cut in with that sky-
pilot talk when im getting right down to
business if i had five minutes alone with
her id have her hand

  ill bet yuh would i agrees a feller
what can lie as fast as you can hadnt
ought to take that long

  youre one of the kind what makes love
by main strength and awkwardness ece
your idea of a courtship is to take a damsel
by the hair drag her home slam her into
a corner and then hammer her with a boot
if she cant cook you say id lie to her
you got to ike no woman was ever told
the truth when she was proposed to she
dont want the truth

  i never beat up no woman magpie
i advises him also i aint no second
george washington

  that night we cooks separate meals and
i got all the best of it cause magpie cant
cook the next morning he beats me to
it weve only got two eggs left and of
course he has to let mine roll off on the
floor now were back where this tale
began with him orating about breaking
bread with me


adventure

  old trailer says i if you baked the
bread we couldnt break it

  he dont reply-just snorts so we eats
on opposite sides of the shack

  some of piperocks prominent citizens
come down to see magpie and their con-
versation leads us to believe that were
incompetent they hints around that they
might a made a mistake when they elects
magpie magpie sighs deep-like and tells
them to not take snap judgment cause
hes going out to get that feller right soon
art miller gets magpie of to one side and
speaks to him in whispers magpie shakes
his head emphatic-like and art acts dis-
gusted after theyre gone i asks magpie
what art wanted

  hes timid got some gold going out
on the stage today and says he hates to
take a chance said it was my duty to see

that he got through safe-like safe-

  hes right says i its your duty
magpie ill go up and see if the lady
needs anything you cant shirk all your
responsibility

  magpie smokes a while and nods

  i reckon youre right ike the office
has to protect them what needs it so ill
send you i was thinking of the pleasant
time you and me was going to have up at
that little cabin today but since your ora-
tion about duty  reckon well have to help
art out you just tell him i sent you for a
guard who yuh writing to ike

  you says i looking up from my
labor this is my resignation magpie
coward says he soft-like

  the harper tribe are a peacefully inclined
lot of human beings and forgiving to a
startling degree but that word means fight
i hits him in the neck with the ink-bottle
and then we tangles

  when we gets through im on the floor
with the stove in my lap while magpie sets
half-way out of the door with a chair hung
around his neck just then scenery sims
sticks his head in the window and yelps
whats this whats this

  i takes one of the legs off that stove and
bounces it off his head and yells

  a draw you squeaky fool

  we hears his boots just hitting the ground
at intervals of three seconds as he labors
back up-town

  magpie wipes some of the blood and ink
off his forehead and glares at me

  youre too danged touchy he wails

we sure do look like making social calls
now dont we

  i wouldnt face her for a million says
he

  neither would i says i

  i cleans my face the best i can and
walks over to the door i takes off my
star and tosses it on the table

  magpie says i im all through no
more will i chase the festive outlaw from
now on im going to be a common citizen
and entitled to come down here and raise
thunder with you for not tending to your
duty im wise to you old-timer being
a ordinary citizen and entitled to protec-
tion i hereby audibly objects to you frit-
tering the countys time away making love
remember magpie i knows your secret
sabe

  i goes over to the bam and saddles up
i aint in no shape to fawn over a lady but
the call of love is strong upon me and i
unconsciously rides in her direction i for-
gets time and distance and all of a sudden
im at her door and shes smiling at me

  maam says i i know i looks repul-
sive but my heart is in the right place i
been in a awful fight and when a mans
wounded he flies away to where his heart is

  where is the sheriff she asks

  the question hurts but i conceals my
grief

  why worry about that sandhill crane
i replies i reckon hes forgot yuh
already maam i quit him today and im
glad of it im of age and fancy free
maam i know i aint much to look at
im a regular old pelican and i aint so pure
as snow but im getting better-thank
yuh when a woman comes into a mans
life it sure cleans house with him the
minute i sees your face i says to myself
there she is ike theres the one
woman- 

we hears the rattle of a broncs
hoofs and then-

  whoa

  i hops to the window and sees magpie
simpkins and then i ducks and yelps

  where can i hide i dont want to see
him

  under the bed she whispers hurry

  i skids under the bunk the blanket
hangs almost to the floor and hides me
fine she opens the door and lets magpie
in
loco or love



  maam says he im sorry to come to
see yuh looking like this but i promised
yuh id come and id a done it if it took
my last drop of blood i had a awful fight
with a outlaw all i had was my bare
hands and ability against his modern wea-
pons and of course i didnt come through
unscathed

  and the outlaw she asks interested-
like what of him

  maam magpie replies weary-like
he crawlcd away to die like a animile
wounded unto death he crawled out of
mortal sight to cash his chips

  i hears magpie sigh deep-like again and
then continues

  maam im-a-a common old coot
ive lived alone so long that i cant seem
to release the words that clamors in my
bosom to be spoke until i seen your face
i aint given a thought to a double rig
im pure in mind and of a forgiving nature
i asks yuh-please dont smile maam
this is a serious chore with me i come

here for succor-

  a magpie i corrects him aloud a
sucker

  there is silence for some time i hears
magpies boots scrape nervous-like on the
floor and he clears his dry throat

  did-did you hear somebody speak
he asks

  she must a shook her head cause he
shuffles his feet again and says

  reckon im getting jumpy well
maam what do yuh think of the proposi-
tion

  where is mister harper today she
asks ignoring his question

   i peeks out from under the bed and i sees
magpies feet real close to me theres a
piece of rope laying between his heels and
the chair leg magpie is scared of snakes
and it gives me an idea

  maam says he lets not speak of
that person he done me dirt just when
i needs him bad he up and quits me for
why because hes scared that feller
aint got no nerve a-tall so long as he can
lay around and do nothing but wear a star
hes a hy-iu officer but the minute he sees
a little trouble showing up he quits cold i
hates a coward maam no man can ever
say that a simpkins flinched when danger

came his-

   z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z says i and begins draw-
ing that rope past his heels

  he freezes to his chair for about three
seconds and then just hits the floor once
before he exits through the door i rolls
out the side of the bed slips the window
open and drops out of the back of the cabin

i gets a glimpse of the ladys face as i slides
over the sill and shes got tears running
down her face

   i figured that this here aint the proper
time for me to make marriage proposals
to the lady and after taking one good
look at her face as i flopped over the
window sill i dont figure that magpie
will stand much show of getting her to sign
up for life

  my bronc has drifted around to the back
which is the reason magpie never saw it
so i leads it away from there and laughs all
the way home

  i rides up to buck mastersons saloon
and meets pete gonyer and a stranger
they immediate and soon surrounds me

   ike this is mister brand states pete
and i shakes the hand of this stranger per-
son mister brand would talk with some-
body from the sheriffs office ike so i turns
him loose on you

  pete wanders away and me and mister
brand sets down on the sidewalk he pulls
out a couple of photygrafts and hands em
to me

  look at them and see if yuh recognize
either one says he

  theres something familiar about one of
them but the other one is a complete
stranger i cant place the other one but
theres a trace some place

  thats kid corey says he this
other one is blazer bailey theyre a
clever pair artists in the hold-up line
im a federal officer they been grab-
bing off a lot of registered mail lately and
the last stunt they pulls off was over on
the main line the kid got hit but some-
how they both got away and headed across
the divide in this direction you been
having so much trouble over here that i
decides to look into it it may not be
them-dont look like their work cause
your cases have all been one man

  blazer is a big husky but corey
wouldnt cause yuh to look twice he used
to be a sort of a actor i believe

  well i cant help yuh much says i
yuh see i aint connected with the sheriffs
office no more maybe the sheriff can give
yuh some information but i doubt it i


adventure

know everything he does and all that i
naturally knows myself but i cant help
yuh none

  ive heard some uncomplimentary things
about the office he admits folks around
here seems to bare their feelings much
obliged anyway mister harper

  i goes down to the office to get my effects
when magpie comes in he sets down and
pretends to read a paper

  where yuh been i asks

  he yawns and folds up the paper
  hunting around a little

  i sets down on the table and rolls a smoke
magpie says i what do yuh know
about snakes

  he drops the paper and sets up straight
in his chair hes got sort of a foolish look
about his face and he sort of gawps at me
uh-uh-snakes i-i dont sabe ike
i didnt think yuh did a mans a
sucker to ask questions of folks he knows
cant answer em

  he uncoils from his chair slides his gun
around to the front and faces me

  ike i got a question to ask you were

  just then the door bangs open and in
comes art miller all out of wind he flops
in a chair and pants

 i-i told yuh the-uh-uh-stage
was huh-held up about fuf-five miles
down the road took all i had-dang the
luck

  mail too i asks and he nods
everything i told yuh

  well well says i that must a
been kid corey or blazer bailey worthy
of your steel magpie

  well aint yuh going to move yelps
art going to let em get plumb away
as usual

  which way did they go

  towards paradise yuh never can tell
which way he went after he got out of
sight

  any danged fool knows that agrees
magpie i reckon i better go after him
i reckon yuh better had pants art
and then lopes back up-town

  magpie fusses around getting ready oil-
ing his guns and fixing a cinch on his saddle

  you sure do go right after em mag-
pie says i you ought to be called
sudden simpkins dont let me hurryyuh
ill go away so yuh can oil your boots and
shave haste makes waste magpie

i goes up-town and shes boiling
theyre organizing a posse to work
independent of the sheriffs office
ut i dont join i got sweeter things to
think of than killing or incarcerating my
feller men the little feller without no
pants on carrying a bow and arrer seems to
beckon me

  i forks my bronc and rides north linger-
ing along building air-castles and so forth
my bronc aint none too energetic and we
consumes plenty of time

  i dips into a canon and rides up a cow
trail when a man with a pack-animile cuts
my path and i recognizes magpie simp-
kins i keeps behind him and pretty soon
he gets off his bronc and seems to be
picking up something off the ground i
rides up slow behind him and rolls a
smoke the son-of-a-gun is so busy he
dont hear me until i clears my throat and
then he whirls around with ms hands full
of flowers

  we looks at each other for half a minute
and then he grins sort of foolish-like and
holds out his hands

  daisies says he daisies

  not today little girl says i i aint
got no water to put em in

  dang fool he snorts

  thats what i thought when i rode up
i agrees from the looks of your pack
id say you was on a protracted trip i
thought art said the robber went south

bronc going in without knocking

  im glancing around the landscape when
i sees two men on hosses cut across behind
me not a quarter of a mile away sudden-
like i sees some more off to my left theyre
acting queer so i spurs my bronc for a
better place to see

  zow-w-w-w flup-p-p-p

  a bullet goes past my ear and another
sticks into the ground a few feet short and
fills my broncs eyes full of sand

  bronc says i somebody desires our
de-mise lets away

  i sticks the spurs in his ribs and races
down the hill that cabin is the best cover
in sight and while i may be a little ahead
of time i feels that magpie will forgive me

  i hits that door just ahead of a handful
of lead and sort of busts up the courtship
the lady looks sort of sick and when i
busts in magpie pulls his guns

  everybody get down low i yelps
who and what is it ike asks magpie
ducking when a bullet dusts some of the
mud from between the logs near his face

  danged if i know they smokes me
up and chases me here

  save me yelps the lady sprawling on

the bunk im sick as-

  such language makes me glance up but
i glues my eyes back to that crack again
where i got some chinking pushed out i
sees a broncs legs so i elevates the muzzle
of my gun and salutes him

a couple of bullets whispers
through the logs so i rolls over
past the bed my elbow bumps on
something and i glances down

  come here i yells heres a cellar
and i begins tugging at the carpet what
covers the door if the carpet hadnt been
ripped id a never found it magpie
skids over to me on his hands and knees
and begins heaving on the handle

  dont yelps the lady dont go down
there theres a-a-snake down there
preferable to hot lead i yells and
slips over the square hole in the floor

  magpie dont wait to crawl down-he
hopped bang a gun explodes right at
my lower extremity and i feels that i got
to buy a new pair of suspenders it sure
was close i lets loose and drops about
seven feet the door drops back and were
in darkness


adventure

well i fell on somebody he pro-
claims got a match handy

  i lights a match and sees magpie setting
on a mans stummick the feller looks sort
of yaller in the face and i dont think hes
got much fight left in his carcass hes
still got a gun in his hand the same of which
we removes magpie looks him over and
snaps some bracelets on his wrists

match shows a rifle against the wall sud-
den-like magpie remembers

over under the door magpie climbs up
and lifts the trap so we can see and it sure
is some tableau

  the door is open there stands that
feller brand with a grin on his face and
behind him is all the piperock population
that can crowd in the lady is standing
there against the wall and all to once she
drops her hand

  bang this brand persons gun comes
up and explodes and the lady falls on her
face magpie moves some quick he
flops out of that cellar whirls on the crowd
with a gun in each hand

drop your guns

  every gun in sight hit the ground and
the lady staggers to her feet

  give me a gun she pants at magpie
but magpie just stares at her

  i takes a look and stares a few lines my-
self her hair is on her shoulder-plumb
off her head and the hair of her head is
brown and parted on the side

  uh-uh- stutters magpie

  brand steps over and takes the guns out
of magpies unresisting hands brand

author of tennessee joe the bully of the big santee etc

m

e was eleven years ofd and he
belonged to the aristocracy of
tennessees mountains on his
mothers side of the house his
father had been a good-looking and good-
natured lazy north carolina hillman to
whom a hound dog was of as much value
as a woman-which after all is saying
very little against his regard for women
he lived this boy with his pretty widowed
young mother in a small cabin near the
head of the rather thickly settled valley
that is called little jerusalem of which
daredevil delaney was king

  his mother sewed for their living there-
fore they were poor enough his wardrobe
consisted of two hickory shirts two pairs
of brown jeans knee-trousers with four
genuine pockets to each two suits of home-
made underwear one pair of very red sus-
penders and a gone-to-seed felt hat that
he wore turned straight up in front des-
perado fashion he scorned to chew to-
bacco run from anybody or tell an out-
right lie and he swore fluently as a sort
of safety-valve but his silent and patient
mother didnt know it this was the one
secret that he had ever kept from her

  buckner newland was his name they
called him buck and he was inordinately
proud of it it made him feel like a man

  buck walked this still and hazy october
afternoon down the crooked and stony road
that led down the crooked and stony creek
until he came to a small field of ripe corn



there he filched the biggest cornstalk he
could find and then he hastened over to
the narrow stream sat himself down beside
it opened his bone-handled barlow knife
and began to whittle out the parts of a
water-wheel

  made and set in the water correctly you
know a cornstalk water-wheel with a stick-
weed axle will run almost forever unless
the creek gets up buck knew exactly how
to make and set them in the water correct-
ly he was now planning to put one every
twenty yards the entire length of the
stream

  suddenly his knife slipped and cut his
finger he was just finishing

  - the thing buck exclaimed

  quickly he felt a pang of guilt and he
looked around to see whether anybody had
heard him who would tell his mother
though he frequently disobeyed her being
blood of her blood and bone of her bone
he held her in great reverence she was the
whole world to him

  and there behind him at the side of the
road smiling just a little was a strange
man of about thirty who sat astride a sleek
and well-saddled black horse the man
was dressed in blue serge with a blue flannel
shirt and a slim black four-in-hand tie he
wore a broad-rimmed black hat and leggings
of yellow leather he was sunburned and
strong-looking and his teeth were big and
white and beautiful

  all right snapped buck defiantly


adventure

  that was the allison in him which
happily predominated

  then the stranger saw the boys bleeding
finger and he seemed rather concerned
he threw his horses rein over its head
dismounted springily drew a white hand-
kerchief from his pocket and advanced
upon buck

  les tie it up son he drawled in the
drawl of the hills and ef i was you
son i wouldnt cuss no more it sounds
rotten

  buck never forgot that he liked that man
the very first time he saw him he sub-
mitted to having his finger bandaged
then he turned to the task of putting the
water-wheel into the creek and the man
watched him with interest the wheel
soon began to run musically

  listen said buck enthused listen
at er clippety-clippety-clip dont she
go purty

  it shore does smiled the strange man
he smiled easily whats ye name son
buck buck newland

  the others face became serious went just
a trifle white

  newland he muttered newland
what was ye mothers fust name

  maty

  which used to be mary allison she
used to live here she married tom new-
land o nawth caliner and went home
with him to live and tom died and she
moved back here a few days ago-am i
right buck

  yeuh yere shore right mother takes
in sewin thes more folks lives here to sew
for ye see an the was lived in nawth
caliner mister might i ax what yore
name is

  the man watched the lads countenance
closely when he gave it-

  delaney

  but the name meant nothing to the boy
buck looked once more at the flying water-
wheel then he grinned up at his companion
howll ye swap knives

  even and sight unseen came readily
though he had already seen bucks give
ye mine for yourn are ye game

  my middle name is game said buck
he swapped a fifteen-cent barlow for a
handsome dollar-and-a-half stag-handled
jackknife

  ye dont mean it cried buck

  again delaney smiled

  i reckon i do son so long and good
luck

  with that he mounted his horse and
galloped away

  it was the finest of all the knives that
buck had ever seen it drowned out all
interest in the monopoly of cornstalk water-
wheels that he had planned even the finger
he had cut with the old barlow was for-
gotten he ran toward home to show his
prize of prizes to his mother

  looky here he exclaimed as he dashed
in at the open cabin doorway

  then he stopped short there talking
with his mother was little jerusalems
herb-digger fortune-teller and newspaper
old and wrinkled granny hood with her
pipe of clay and her sourwood staff she
was smoking like a burning brush-heap
buck saw that she wore a dark calico dress
a red bandanna and a red undershirt-at
least

  what is it bucky boy asked mary
newland

  he went to her and showed her the knife
he told her all that he had to tell about
his new friend mary newland turned a
little pale at the name even as delaney
had gone a little pale at hers she took
the handsome knife to the fire that smol-
dered in the wide-mouthed stone fireplace
and consigned it to the live coals then
she unwrapped the crimson-stained hand-
kerchief from her sons injured finger and
was about to throw it too into the fire
when granny hood called shrilly

  dont mary its bad luck its bad
luck to burn blood

  mary newland dropped the handker-
chief to the hearth perhaps she reasoned
it would be better to wash it and send it
back to let him know that she didnt care
to be under obligations to him for even the
wrapping of a finger

buck wondered at this to buck
it was the un-understandable dur-
ing all that century of time his
mother had never said a word the look
in her eyes had kept him from uttering a
protest he turned to granny hood as
though he expected her to tell him what
was the matter the old scandal-monger
was by no means loath

  that was daredevil delaney boy
she croaked and hes a plumb bad man
hes rich he heired his daddys farm and
blood of the allisons



big frame house at the lower end o this
here valley whar he lives with his maw
he owns timber and cattle sheeps and
hosses hes as wild as a buck deer and
he fights like a wildcat what a mad dawg
has bit and he robs the law dont seem
to be able to git any proof on him and
yit i did hear o the county sheriff afore
thisn a sayin at daredevil made about

the best law they could have out here-

  at this point mary newland interrupted
in a tremulous white voice

  thatll be enough about hale delaney

i	reckon granny hood maybe you didnt
know it but i dont low his name spoke in
my house granny

  the peppery old woman rose on her long
staff half-angry and turned toward the
door but she stopped and faced about

  he was a fine young man ontel ye
throwed him down mary and you know
it as wells ye know nights dark he
haint never keered for nothin sence that
day i reckon i wont bother ye no more
and i reckon i wont cry about it
was the spicy reply of the young widow

  granny hood stamped her way out on
her sourwood staff mrs newland went
back to her sewing but she seemed to do
everything wrong even buck noticed it
finally a question took form in his mind
and he decided to risk asking it

  mother what made ye throw him
down

  it was afore i was married she said
solemnly we had the wost quarrel
in the world i swore i never would speak
to him no more and i never have and i
never will

  the truth of the matter was that she
had married for spite as women-more
especially women of the mountains-do
now and then for herself she had made
a thorny bed but she had lain in it well
oh exceedingly well which went far to
prove the soul of a martyr saint deep
down in the woman she had the intense
nature and the corresponding temper of
lightning-fire of a people who had fought
themselves well nigh to extinction and
she was still angry at daredevil delaney
because she loved him above everything
except buck on earth but she wouldnt
admit it to herself never you know how
women are with their love affairs

  contrary to granny hoods opinion
of the matter mary allisons throwing

him down had not made delaney the
man he was had he married her he would
have been the same wild good-natured and
rollicking free-blooded daredevil that he
was though he probably wouldnt have
gambled any the greatest result of her
refusing to be his wife had been only that he
had remained unmarried

  now this delaney was not what one
might call bad he simply saw that the
people of his neighborhood and neighboring
neighborhoods lived with a fair semblance
of correctness that was all if a man
was not providing for his family he had a
warning if he did not immediately mend
his ways daredevil delaney gave him a
whipping that he did not soon forget
delaney caused men to pay their debts
support the preacher and buy more corn-
meal and bacon than yellow-corn whisky

  of course he had his enemies as well as
his friends and of course there had been
committed grave crimes that had been
put at his door-which was inevitable and
which often had placed him in jeopardy and
made his position one scarcely to be
envied

  mother suddenly asked buck are
ye sick ye look like ye was

  mary newland that was mary allison
turned her eyes upward from the sewing
that was now so difficult for her to do

  i-i think i am a little i think i ought
o walk out some maybe

  she rose and dropped her sewing to her
chair she put on her blue gingham bonnet
and started for the door

les go down to see my flutter-wheel
suggested buck yought o see it agoin
clippety-clippety-clip will ye mother
maybe youd better stay around home
said mary newland

  she passed across the threshold and went
slowly toward the gate

  the boy stood in the cabin doorway and
watched her go with keen disappointment
in his clear brown eyes it was very unlike
her to refuse to let him accompany her
anywhere buck did not know that down
the valley and up a silent hemlock-filled
cove there was an old trysting-place that
was still to her a shrine-a great and
beautiful white beech tree laden with
golden yellow leaves and under it a
bubbling spring bordered with sword-ferns
and laurel while cut in the bark of the tree
were the almost grown-over initials m a


adventure

and h d nor did buck know that the
old shrine was calling calling to his mother
as it had never never called before

  the lad walked down to the ripe corn-
field took another big cornstalk went back
to the cabin and borrowed a table-knife
from the cupboard and made a cornstalk
fiddle it was after sundown when mary
newland returned

  the following morning she washed and
ironed daredevil delaneys handkerchief-
and she did a job to be proud of-wrapped
it in a page of an old story-paper and sent
buck to the delaney home with it

  go right to the house and come right
back she instructed dont stay and
dont talk to em

  wellum said buck

  once in the crooked road buck decided
that he was utterly too weary to walk such
a great distance-it was fully a mile there-
fore he broke off a long frostbitten iron-
weed for a sleek black horse mounted it
and rode at a gallop most of the way to the
delaney frame house at the lower end of
the valley the house set a hundred yards
from the road and there were apple-trees
before it and to either side of it and march-
ing up the gentle slope behind it it had
been painted white and honeysuckles ran
over the front porch a hound ran out
and growled at him and the voice of
daredevil delaney promptly scolded it
back

  come on in son said delaney i
wont let him bite ye

  buck went on delaney sat on the porch
plaiting a rawhide band for his hat he rose
and pushed his chair toward the boy buck
shook his head and tossed the little package
into the others hands then he turned to

go-

  wait buck smiled delaney and buck
forgot orders from headquarters and waited

  to him that voice was magic to him that
man stood for all that was big and line
noble and bold

  delaney began to open the package
when he saw and recognized his own
handkerchief now snow-white and im-
maculate and folded so very precisely he
muttered under his breath-

  allison

  his strong face at once became a study
it was almost as though he saw a ray of
hope he went on aloud-

  she wasnt mad was she son

  again buck forgot his instructions he
answered readily

  yeuh she was mad she burnt up that
knife you gi me and now i aint got no
more knife an a rabbit granny hood
she said yore name was daredevil is it
delaney ignored the question and drew
a fifteen-cent bone-handled barlow from
one of his trousers pockets

  it shore aint fair for me to keep this
when youve got none he drawled here
take it buck

  the boy accepted it very gladly

  now wait said delaney ontel i come
back

he went into the house
through an open window in the
old-fashioned parlor buck saw him
place the folded handkerchief reverently
between the leaves of a big family bible
as though it were some frail dead flower
connected with memories that were sacred
three minutes later and delaney came
back with his smiling little old mother and
in her hands she carried a molasses cake
and a paper bag of red apples

  this is her boy said delaney he
looks like her now dont he

  as much as beans the feeble old
woman laughed weakly she gave buck
the bag of apples and the molasses cake
and continued sonny tell ye mother
id be powful glad ef shed come to see me
tell her id come to see her ef i jest
wasnt so porely la la but mary alli-
son used to be so purty that the sight of her
would might nigh it cyore sore eyes id
shore like to see her sonny

  shes a heap purtier now an she ever
was declared buck she gits purtier
and purtier ever day wimmen like her
dont never git ugly-lord no some-
times i quit aplayin and go to the house
jest to have a look at her shes that con-

sarned purty-

  a bass voice that buck had never heard
before interrupted and it came from some-
where not far beyond the vines that almost
walled in the porch

  i beg your pardon daredevil and i sure
do hate to do it but i got to arrest you in
the name o the law

  it was one of the high sheriffs lowland
deputies and he walked heavily to the top
of the porch steps delaneys countenance
flashed less serious he almost smiled
blood of the allisons



  i reckon he replied ye dont mind a
tellin me what i done

  youre accused of beating old curtis
holden until he died from it and robbing
him curtis holden himself said so told
a dozen before he winked out it was
yesterday afternoon about four oclock in
holdens sitting-room

  delaneys face now became serious again
look here emmett you know i
wouldnt beat a old man like that you
know i never done it holden might ha
reely thought it was me what with his
imaginins and his nighsightedness and my
repitation but it shore wasnt me im
white emmett and you know it

  to tell you the truth i dont believe
you did it emmett admitted but orders
are orders and i got to arrest you

  i beg leave to differ with ye snapped
out delaney to be arrested is to be sent
to the state prison for life-if i aint hung-
for somethin i didnt do to git down to
facts you aint man enough emmett to
put irons on me and you wouldnt shoot me
acause you yoreself dont believe i done it
so how are ye agoin to arrest me emmett
the deputy did not draw a weapon
because he believed that he could accom-
plish more by means of his great strength
alone delaney was unarmed and emmett
was a big man besides delaney knew
that the other wouldnt shoot emmett
turned to the much-troubled mrs delaney

  please step into the house he requested
kindly

  go mother said the mountaineer
and she went

  buck newland stood like a post his face
as serious as a mask of napoleon and
watched every movement of the deputy as
he took handcuffs from his belt and ad-
vanced upon his man delaneys eyes
flashed at the sight of the disgraceful irons
he went suddenly white as he put out his
wrists as though to receive the manacles
a look of satisfaction spread over emmetts
countenance but delaney seized the irons
tore them from the others hands and
jammed them into one of his own rear
trousers pockets

  for one second emmett stared in sur-
prise they sprang to the ground and
faced each other to run from one man
was much against delaneys liking though
the officer now had drawn a weapon
delaney dove under with the lithe quickness

of a panther with his left hand he caught
emmetts gun-wrist and with his right
he wrenched the revolver free then he
struck the deputy a chest blow that stag-
gered him stepped backward and threw
the revolver over apple-trees and into a
blackberry thicket

  at this the lowlander did a thing an
officer of the law never should have done
he flew into a rage gritted out an oath and
struck at the hillman with a punch that
might have broken bones if it had landed
from that moment it became a good round
battle emmett was the stronger of the
two but his adversary was electric

  they squared themselves and put up
their guards much as lumberjack fighters
do buck stepped to the ground his
molasses cake was squeezed almost flat
under one arm and his face was flushed
with fiery interest emmett put himself
on the offensive at once he struck feinted
struck again and landed on the others
shoulder spinning him around

  hit him fairly screamed buck why
dont ye bust him daredevil

  delaney recovered himself in a way that
delighted the boy he had to fight now
and for his life to run from an unarmed
man was unthinkable and he couldnt be
arrested he darted in cleverly and de-
liberately slapped emmett on the jaw and
drew emmetts arms upward then broke
under with a mighty blow and drove the
deputy backward twenty feet

  dawg-gone yelled buck that was
a lulu

  by this time emmett had forgotten all
about arresting delaney to the deputy
it had become a personal matter he came
back with a hoarse bellow like a maddened
bull and struck half a dozen blows that
landed on nothing more solid than air
delaney gave him a punch on the point of
the jaw and it dazed him for a moment

  pour it to him cried buck pour
it to him daredevil yeve shore got him
now ef yell only pour it to him

  emmett went at his adversary again
and using a part of delaneys own battling
tactics knocked delaney flat the hill-
man lay there supine as though he were
unconscious for a few seconds and the
panting deputy watched him closely buck
newland put the molasses cake and the
apples on the porch took out his barlow
knife and opened it


adventure

  dont ye hit him he told emmett
while hes down ef ye do ill cut a hole
in ye

  delaney rose came to life like a steel
spring and the real battle began for five
minutes they battered each other and blood
flowed from their faces then emmett
sought for a clench his wind was weakening
while delaney was going faster than ever
delaney slipped on the grass and emmett
leaped to his back but delaney straighten-
ed his legs and had the giant on his hip a
supreme effort and the big lowlander was
thrown over delaneys head and into a heap

  another moment and the mountaineer
had taken the manacles from his pocket
and snapped them on emmetts wrists

  youre a man he said smiling and
panting at the same time that id haf
to kill to whip i dont want to kill ye
emmett id sudgest that ye go back to
sheriff hanley and explain to him what a
merry job hes agoin to have a-takin hale
delaney to jail

  without a word in reply emmett rose
and walked down the road mounted his
horse and rode toward johnsville in the
flat country when he was out of sight
delaney turned to buck

  howd ye like that son

  fine buck answered i wisht i was
a man

  but i hope yell have more plain com-
mon sense an ive had son muttered
daredevil delaney very seriously when
yere a man

  he sat down on the steps bent his head
and was very still he was a fool for
having made the name he had made for
himself to leave his invalid mother
entirely was a thing he could not do and
they would arrest him sooner or later
and when they did arrest him his repu-
tation would cost him his life

  mrs delaney came out and sat down on
the step above him she put a wrinkled
old hand on his thick black hair and she
too was very still

  the silence was too much for buck he
took up the presents the mother of dare-
devil delaney had given him went down
to the dusty road mounted his ironweed
horse and galloped toward home to take
the cake and the fruit to his mother would
be to lose them he knew so he stopped at
the water-wheel and made a cache there
among the stones

  he didnt show her the barlow knife
either he didnt dare but he told her
all that which mrs delaney had said to
tell her and he gave a very vivid account
of the fight and the latter-named was
quite sufficient to cause mary newland to
scorch the bread they had for dinner

curtis holden was not gen-
erally loved like a brother but he
was an old man and sentiment over
the county ran high against hale delaney
officers were soon combing the big hills for
him and a substantial reward was offered
delaney remained in the little jerusalem
neighborhood and he was put to his wits
end day and night to provide food for
himself and to elude the men who hunted
him singly and by twos and threes it was
not the officers that he feared the enemies
who hunted him for the sake of the reward
the judases-it was those whom he feared
they knew the fastnesses of the mountains
even as he knew them

  then the meanest and most villainous of
all those enemies discovered daredevil
delaneys hiding-place it was high up
on the side of the western mountain in a
nest of cliffs and boulders and it was
impregnable to two four or six ten men
might take delaney from that retreat but
that would split the reward into ten parts
this long-haired and lanky cunning enemy
figured for hours to find out how many
times ten would go into a thousand and
shook his head when he finally knew then
he laid a plan

  he had his slatternly third wife go to
buckner newland the only boy in little
jerusalem who didnt know her with a
smooth tale she found buck playing
beside the cornstalk water-wheel as usual

  listen at her said buck clippety-
clippety-clip dont she go purty

  sonny the woman began wheedlingly
do you know daredevil delaney
yeuh nodded buck and i like
him wussn most anything why they
aint got him have they

  no they aint got him well his
mother shes awful sick about to die
she wants him to sneak home to see her
jest as quick as ever he can dye reckon
ye could find him and tell him he
wouldnt hide from you he wouldnt be
askeered o you ye see tell him his
cousin lucy sent ye
blood of the allisons



  according to the plan delaney would
walk into the hands of the high sheriff
for delaney was the man to go to his
mother if she were dying and sent for him
though he hung for it there were a num-
ber of tilings he held dearer than his life

  are you his cousin lucy asked the
boy

  yes hed mrs tinker davis iii
will ye go sonny

  ef i knowed said buck whar to
look

  the woman pointed

  ye see them big rocks away off up
yander ye might go up thar and look
its shore a likely place

  ill go shore buck told her

  he rose crossed the little stream on
stones and dove into the laurels and the
woman went down the road in spite of
the ruggedness of the mountainside and
in spite of the newly fallen chestnut burrs
that now and then pricked his feet painfully
the boy reached the temporary haunt of
his god after an hour of traveling

  instead of his finding delaney naturally
delaney found him buck had climbed
to the top of a low cliff and was searching
the city of boulders above with all his eyes
when delaney spoke from a point a short
distance to his left

  well son

  the hunted man was pale and starved-
looking and his gaze was so piercing that
it almost scared buck newland perched
on the brink of that little precipice buck
delivered the message of mrs tinker davis
iii word for word now the outlawed
delaney had a cousin lucy of course

  what sort o lookin woman was she
he immediately wanted to know

  she was dressed in yeller and red and
she toted a spicewood toothbresh in her
mouth and she had a wart on her nose
the man before buck smiled worriedly
wart on her nose eh unlucky wart
missis tinker davis he growled thats
shore a lowdown trick to try to play on me
anybody thatd try to do a trick like that
buck is a-ought o be killed plumb dead
buck you do me this here favor go straight
to missis tinker davis the polecat and
tell her ill make her wisht id tarred and
feathered her man ef i live now be

keerful-

  a groan broke from his throat buck
had started back down the little cliff and

buck bad lost his hold and fallen there
was no outcry and this fact frightened
daredevil delaney he rushed to the
brink and peered over crumpled down
there on the dead leaves was the inert figure
of his one-time sweethearts barefooted
tow-headed boy with a tiny trickle of
crimson lying across his white and up-
turned face

  delaney climbed down hurriedly he
knelt and took bucks head and shoulders
to his knee and with his handkerchief wiped
away the blood that had come from a
wound in the lads temple

  son he mumbled agonizedly thickly
tears filling his eyes son ye aint dead
are ye son

  there was no answer he put his ear
to the youthful chest and heard laintiy
the beating of the youthful heart he
believed buck was dying the heartbeats
were much too faint it seemed to him

  ef tinker davis dont pay for this
he said in a voice that was bleak oh ef
tinker davis dont pay for this

  for to him it was no accident he
gathered the limp little body up in his
arms with the law and its minions and all
his enemies forgotten and began to move
rapidly with the surefootedness of a
panther down the rugged steep and into
danger he well knew how that life he
held against his breast was valued if it
went out for him-for his sake-he well
knew what that would mean too a
prayer went up from the soul of him that
the boy might live and at the bottom of it
there was nothing selfish

  he crossed the brook at the water-wheel
waded it with his boots on when he might
have crossed on stones and he noted
absently that the wheel was still running-
clippety-clippety-clip into the crooked
road he turned and sheriff hanley hidden
alone a little away down the valley saw
him and put spurs to his horse riding
up beside delaney he leveled his revolver
at the small of his back

  youre under arrest daredevil ive
got you

  delaney didnt stop he turned a white
and desperate face toward the officer

come on wi me sheriff he replied
you can have me as soon as ive took this
boy home i never have broke a promise
sheriff hanley leaned over and snatched
his prisoners revolver from its holster as


adventure

he rode on beside him at the newlands
gate he dismounted and left his horse with
its rein hanging and followed the other man
into the cabin mary newland rose at
their sudden entrance and her sewing
dropped to the floor delaney went
straight to the bed and put the raglike
form down on an old pieced coverlet

  he fell- he began and could say no
more

  bucks mother knelt beside him and
just then buck came to his wound was
not serious for a moment he stared at one
and then at the other of the two men he
knew the sheriff the officer had been
pointed out to him quickly he put
things together and he understood fully
then he fastened accusing eyes on the face
of the representative of the law and his
voice came slowly in words that cut-

  mister sheriff yere a-yeller dawg

  buck his mother reproved half-
sobbing

  delaney filled with gratitude looked at
the woman she rose and returned the
look it was a very peculiar look then
the officer put his hand on his mans
shoulder and delaney muttered this

  i said ye could have me so ye can
they took daredevil delaney to johns-
ville where they lodged him in the strongest
cell they had many many were those
who visited the jail for a glimpse of him
a newspaper man came up from knoxville
tried to get him to talk and tried to photo-
graph him-and failed all around

  court was in session at johnsville and
delaneys trial was called without delay
the sentiment of the general public had
grown even higher against him and those
who were considered versed in such matters
openly predicted that he would soon
straighten out a hangmans rope

the day of the trial was hazy and
the snap of autumn was in the air
everybody that was anybody in
little jerusalem went buck newland and
his mother rode in chairs in the back of old
abner lanes ox-wagon half of mary
newland had been trying to persuade her
that she wouldnt help hale delaney to
save his immortal soul while the other
half had been telling her that she must
save him-if she could perhaps this was
why she sat down with her boy midway
of the crowded courthouse

  an elderly man with billygoat whiskers
and a broad bare upper lip sat next to the
young widow and her son chewed store-
bought tobacco and spat through a knot-
hole in the floor and berated daredevil
delaney for all he was worth one-half
of bucks pretty mother rejoiced at it and
the other half resented it all of buck
resented it bitterly

  youd be askeered to talk that way
suddenly blurted the lad ef he wasnt
whar hes at and you wouldnt talk that
away ef i was as big as you neither
buck said mary newland

  she had never heard him declare himself
so strongly in favor of delaney before

  that little rats pizen mean the billy-
goat-bearded man laughed to his neighbor

  i aint no rat flared the boy spirit-
edly-and out came his barlow knife it was
the allison in him and ef ye call me
that any more ill shore cut ye to the
windpipe

 buck mary newland moaned
shocked but she neednt have been sur-
prised for it was only the allison in him

  he wasnt called a rat again she caught
him by the arm and drew him over to
her

  son she whispered queerly do ye like
hale delaney

  buck looked her squarely in the eyes
  like him i love him

  then the trial began the evidence was
most damaging curtis holdens dying
statement counted heavily counsel for
the defense proved that holden was half-
blind and that it was nearly dark in
holdens sitting-room at four oclock in
the afternoon but all that seemed to
impress the jury but little delaneys
reputation was very bad

  it was short soon the judge was
charging the jury and it was not in favor
of the accused

  just as the charge was being finished
mary newland rose-and buck followed
her-and went up to the judge she was
sworn and she took the witness stand for
the prisoner who could hardly believe he
saw correctly and there she did that
which to the woman of the mountains is
next to death she bravely told the world
of her early love affair with hale delaney
and of their bitter quarrel of her marrying
for spite and of her lying for five years in
the bed of thorns she had made of her
heathens



struggle to support herself and her son of
the burning of the knife that hale delaney
had given to the boy

  then she told of her going to the old
beech at the bubbling spring the old beech
that had their initials cut in its white bark
she told of watching delaney renew those
initials with the knife that had been her
boys and of watching him for a long time
while he sat there and thought of the very
things that were in her own mind

  and that had been from three to five oclock
on the afternoon of october fourth the very
time of curtis holdens assault and robbery

 mary newland withstood the most
grilling cross-questioning they couldnt
entangle her counsel for the defense
made his argument again and this time it
had strength with the jury delaney was
acquitted received a kindly lecture from the
judge and promised to remember it

  when he looked for mary newland that
had been mary allison she was gone back
to her cabin in little jerusalem he
bought a marriage license and followed her

  buck newland and his mother sat by a
bright log fire roasting chestnuts that

chill mountain evening when a rap came
at the door buck called out a cordial
come in the door opened and hale
delaney entered he walked straight to
the stone hearth knelt before her who had
been his first and only sweetheart and took
up both her hands

  this is the fust time ive ever bent my
knees to anything mortal in the universe
mary he said im askin ye to
marry me

  allison looked across to allison the
boys eyes twinkled hopefully in the fire-
light and she remembered his saying in
the courthouse i love him she lifted
the kneeling mans hands to her lips and
kissed them she bent her head to his
shoulder happy because hate was dead

  ive burnt enough blood she told him
ill marry ye hale

  the next week delaney was made a
deputy sheriff and the week after that
he arrested tinker davis for the robbery
and murder of curtis holden and mrs
tinker davis iii wished before it was
over that daredevil delaney had tarred
and feathered her husband instead

mhe young stranger-rideout was
his name a nephew of buck
rideout the planter-sat on
the outrigger of a beached
canoe and stared at the dark-hued tavau
who stood some distance away as she coyly
poked the sand with her toes and glanced
up from time to time with artful shyness

  women said lean jake removing
his pipe and scratching his chin with the
mouthpiece women is all alike

  having delivered that favorite bit of
wisdom he replaced the pipe and continued
to watch rideout who was ready enough
to carry the flirtation forward but hesi-
tated a little being embarrassed by the


adventure

presence of jake and myself as we stretched
in the shade beside the shanty bar and idly
looked on

  nice boy jake said some minutes later
after the enticing tavau had walked out
of sight in the pandanus grove with the
breeze immodestly pulling her calico gown
against her body and after rideout had
followed her but with an effort to appear
merely wandering at random

  nice boy jake repeated but hes
leamin fast-leamin fast

  jake called it lar-r-nnin and disguised
many other words in much the same way
but he spoke from the wisdom of sixty-odd
years more than forty of them spent below
the equator for all of his years he was
built like six feet some inches of taut
hawser an old-time sailor he was but
beardless slow of movement and speech
and as full of yarns as ever a man was who
has roved no doubt some of those yarns
were true

  but hes leamin fast jake went on
nodding his head toward the grove hes
twenty-some hours on the island and hasnt
been bit by a cannibal yet he thought
theyd be ugly as the pictures always is
that missionaries send back to help raise
funds and then tavau gets her eyes on him
and he just simply cant hardly believe his
own eyes cause she acts like some of the
girls back home-only does it better yes
hes leamin fast

  and he thinks the devil wont sign him
up for no longer cruise on the sulfur lake
for an hour or so with this heathen than for
hours or so with other marys hes forgot
quick-like and her bein a heathen it dont
make no difference no-how uh-huh hes
got a lot to learn too

  the rev ollivant and his niece miss
rankin would have been shocked to know
that jake called tavau a heathen for
didnt she wear a calico gown instead of a
yellow tipula and lavolava the mission-
aries thought the wrapper much more
civilized than a breast-cloth usually tucked
under the chin to be out of the way or else
failing its purpose with every puff of wind
when not tucked up and the lavolava
had never been devised that did not appear
on the verge of dropping from the shapely
legs it concealed

  uh-huh hes got a lot to learn jake
repeated-thoughtfully again glancing to-
ward the grove

jake had a wild and extravagant
yarn for special confidences about
having known and fought under the
chief who had been tavaus grandfather
of having held a musket to the heads of an
enemy boat-crew as he sailed away in the
starless night for whatever port god willed
to keep tavaus grandmother numoo
from being the prize as she had been the
cause of that obscure homeric war wherein
her husband fell beneath a jagged club

 numoo must have been a fiery and
resolute woman if she did not only what
jake but legend as well reported of her
she was said to have stood watch with the
musket when jake needs must sleep and
the ancient gods of her tongian people
answered her prayers for the canoe reached
a not unfriendly island where numoo was
welcomed and the crew at her vengeful
request was promptly beheaded

 numoo married a chief and at last
succeeded in nagging himinto war for her
revenge but he fared badly because the
missionaries were busy in his domain and
reported him to the british government
as a turbulent blood-thirsty fellow who had
killed some of their converts a gunboat
scattered his war canoes and numoo was
again a widow

  she prayed that the unborn child would
be a son and went daily deep into the forest
to an idol hidden from the jealous mission-
aries but the bulging-eyed god answered
her with a daughter whom to keep from
the missionaries she carried to another
island and raised in the faith of her tribal
gods the white men - traders beach-
combers colonists and inevitable mission-
aries-crowded even that island but the
daughter naima was instructed in the old
tongian faith as she grew up into her
teens she was wooed in the divers ways of
the white men with however less success
than the amorous adventurers often have

  but to make lean jakes epic brief
after the mothers death naima married
the handsomest of the unconverted natives
who happened to be a samoan and to the
great amusement and scandal of the island
a few years later she clubbed him out of his
own hut when the missionaries finally saved
his soul largely through the efficacy of a
job-so delightful to samoan vanity-of
bossing in the construction of some thatched
huts for the missionary station but tavau
the seven-year old daughter was forcibly
heathens



taken from the incorrigibly heathenish
mother and given into christian hands
and later she was sent to the rev ollivant
and his niece as a mission girl at niko

  that was ten years before but in the
south seas seven years plus ten bring a
girl to maturity of body and to all the
instinctive subtleties of womanhood every-
where

  there is another dramatic chapter to
this history a chapter that i suspected of
being apochryphal and added for the
benefit of the big german trader schwartz
ever since tavau came to niko he had
been after her and jake opportunely
either invented or remembered the chapter
in which tavaus mother shortly before
her death had driven a fishing spear into
the belly of an overly gallant trader who
inevitably enough had been a german-
since jake detested all german traders and
planters-but who by a most remarkable
coincidence had been named schwartz

  i never seen him myself jake had
drawled to the group of listeners in the
shanty bar as he finished this new episode
of his oft-reeited odyssey but schwartz
just supposin you pull up your shirt-tail
and lets have a look

  schwartz cursed angrily and stamped out
almost shaking the earth with his bulky
tread while our laughter followed him into
the moonlight all of us thought that
jake had neatly put over an elaborate
joke and schwartz was not popular

tavau was half-samoan and the
samoans are the coquettes of the
south seas the tongans them-
selves-though not quite civilized or rather
christianized-are a paradox in wrath
they are undoubtedly as fierce as any tribe
that touches the pacific but their disposi-
tion is such as to have won for their group
of islands the geographical designation of
friendly

  tavau was an outrageous flirt for all of
her calico wrapper hymnals and quaint
tutoring of native tots in biblical lore
when anywhere near the missionaries or
elder converts this precious little hypocrite
of seventeen tropical summers was un-
smiling and serious as a nun but with
half a chance she flirted and for the same
reason that a parakeet suns and preens its
brilliant feathers

  tavau knew all of jakes story possibly

  excepting the apocryphal chapter and she
often queried him for infinite details as to
her mother and grandparents though
perhaps in her inmost mind she doubted
as some of us did the entire tale the
rev ollivant and the efficient miss rankin
solemnly assured her that it was unlikely
there was a word of truth in the story
but tavau hungering for the legends of
her scattered tribe quested among jakes
memories for more and more details when
as frequently she crept to his side in some
remote thicket there she stared wistfully
into the shadows while he repeated the old
old tale

  what all else jake may have talked about
to her i do not know but often he said
something like this to me these mission-
aries come out here from people that have
had two thousand years of the bible and
arent christians yet they expect these
heathens to take a bath put on mother
hubbards and never again feel the wild
blood that cant be got rid of except by a
knife that opens their veins and lets it
run out

  ever see a christian nigger when the
wood drum booms the devil-devil dance
hes just like a good healthy fish that sud-
denly wakes up and finds hes been sleeping
on the beach about ten feet above where
the little waves are running along over
the sand whispering and looking for him
and theres the forest older than the bible
where every leafs a tongue chanting the
ancient songs-where the ghosts of old
cannibal chiefs are darting through the
shadows beating drums and sounding
conches that white men cant hear and
we white men-dont we get it so strong
that we come tumbling out of the cities
forget the prayers learned in the cradle
and go knocking about the world

  it takes mighty little to make a
heathen-mighty little in this climate
jake usually said when bringing one of his
ethnological lectures to an end

ii

it was some time before jake
and i realized that we had that
afternoon watched the first scene
of a little south sea drama a few days
later a queensland labor-trader put into
niko short-handed from a little skirmish
with reluctant laborers over at santa
	adventure

cruz-the natives there were cannibals
fierce and wary-and jake was taken on as
mate and i went along

  when we came back the village hummed
with gossip and rumors

  buck rideout was the richest planter
on ten islands he thought missionaries
were only one degree removed from witch-
doctors but he was a stern moral man
himself and had contempt for white
niggers as he called the fathers of half-
breeds whether or not there had been a
marriage ceremony

  some of the gossips said that young
rideout had knocked his uncle down in a
quarrel over tavau

  this rumor was founded largely on the
fact that buck rideout had worn a bandage
about his head when he came wrathfully
to the rev ollivant and told him that if
he did not keep that young mary-preacher
from his nephew there would be one female
less to sing-sing at prayer-meeting

  however regarding the cause for the
bandage some-the less scandal-loving on
the island-said that a ripe coconut had
fallen on his head

  anyway he came to complain of tavau
and her name was bandied on the beach

  theyve got her locked up tighter an
a clam in its shell and theyre after sendin
her off on the missionary ship thats due
next month one fellow indignantly ex-
plained to me just as though ever girl
in the parish back up there where they
make missionaries dont go for a moonlight
stroll with some lad that likes her and
her him

  we who loafed on the beach were what
is called in some quarters pretty broad-
minded and in our indignation nobody
referred to the fact that converted native
girls are forbidden to go out after sundown
and that tavau had resorted rather fluently
to pious lies to get out-saying she was
to visit a sick sister-christian or to tell
bible stories to a doubting household
and not once did i hear anybody suggest
that both the rev ollivant and miss
rankin were painfully aware of the ease
with which white men parted from native
girls and that the missionaries might really
be on the watch-out for tavaus comfort
of mind as well as security of soul

  true enough young rideout was not a
beach-comber trader or even a planter
he was just a stripling of twenty or there-

  about full of the curious impulses and
strange intensities of youth who had come
out to live with his bachelor uncle and
eventually to inherit the plantation

  the rev ollivant had only past experi-
ences to guide him and among those had
never been such a figure as this boy who
was neither fugitive adventurer nor
tourist

  some man who wrote a book that was
left around one time where i had nobody
to talk to and nothing else to read said
that from infancy to maturity the human
being reflects in a minute way the entire
evolutionary history of the race

  i remember only three of his many
citations one was that the new-born
infant has strength enough in its tiny
fingers to support its weight by clinging
to a trapeze which is a throw-back to
arboreal days when our ancestors lived
in trees and the babe had to hang on to
its mother or drop another was that the
instinctive cruelty of children of about
eight to fifteen their urge to play at
fighting and their joy in weapons reflects
the savagery through which the race has
passed and the other that the extravagant
sentimentality and emotional devotion of
the youth from around sixteen to twenty
when he is in love-as he usually is-
attests the shadowy presence in his brain
cells of the famous old knights errant who
in the age of chivalry jousted mightily
with their ladies garter or veil or glove
at the lances haft and quixotically for-
swore even principalities to win the smile
and hand of some maid who capriciously
put them to strange quests and vows

  young rideout was not over twenty and
i reflected that the knights errant must be
holding a magnificent tourney under his
cranium if he would crack an ax handle
over the head of his uncle endanger the
very valuable plantation and set the beach
gleefully a-roar with his talk of real love
all because a native girl who but for a
little less fulness of the lips was not unlike
hundreds back in the bush that danced
howling and naked in the moonlight feast
of cannibals

  but even with all the reports i heard
jake gathered something more and swore
that he believed it too however schwartz
being a german i knew that jake would
believe anything to his discredit the
report that jake believed came straight
 heathens



from a reliable source-or as straight as
anything ever could come from the mission
to the bar shanty

  that is ollivant told the native preacher
who was overheard swearing his wife to
secrecy by one of the mission girls who
told a boy that she wished to favor who
told his elder brother because naturally
he had to tell somebody and the brother
told jake for a secret drink of gin that
wise law enforced by the full majesty of
british authority which permits a white
man all the liquor on earth if he can get it
but which makes the punishment severe
for giving or selling so much as a drop to
a native assures the beach-comber of always
having the wherewith to extract favors
from black boys

  it seemed that schwartz ever with his
eyes on tavau was quick to suspect that
she had tossed her witchery over young
rideout schwartz bulky as ah ox and
with a beard that was likely to get tangled
in the bush at night had begun soft-
footedly to spy on her

  him fella torti was as near as jakes
informant could manage the germans
name but the rest of the story had come
in native dialect for jake knew enough
native dialects to have filled a half-dozen
south sea dictionaries

  schwartz had discovered that when
tavau was supposed to be proselyting
or even when supposed to be on her mat
asleep she stole out and met rideout

  instead of doing as anybody but a
deutscher would have done jake con-
temptuously told me and have kicked

the boy to - and away from her and

sat down hisself the deutscher went to
ollivant and says he believes it his duty
to inform the missionary of whats going
on because he schwartz mind you is a
christian though rheumatism dont let
him get to church often as he would like
yes schwartz believes in looking out for
native morals-

  jake expatiated most of the night on
schwartzs tale-bearing and convinced
himself while trying to convince me that
schwartz-tipcal deutscher-had car-
ried his story to the missionary with a good
deal of cunning jake said that schwartz
reasoned this way here is a good chance
for me to let the missionary know what a
fine christian gentleman i am and with
tavaus reputation badly soiled it will

appear magnanimous of me later on to offer
to marry her the missionary will be
grateful to me because he will want to be
rid of her any way-so she will be pushed
right into my arms

  and jake concluded whats one
marriage more or less to a deutscher

  i did not take any stock in jakes de-
ductions or in the circumambulated story
on which they were based-not until about
a week before the mission ship was due
when the shanty bar rang with laughter
over the latest and best joke

  how the truth of the matter got out
i never knew but undoubtedly by a relay
of native mouths ending with a drink or
two of gin for the last anyway the report
we heard was as near the truth as anything
ever is in the south seas and along toward
midnight a few of the more reckless fellows
made their way to schwartzs shack and
endeavored to offer condolences through
the walls of plaited palm leaves

  it seems that schwartz knowing that
the mission ship on which tavau was to
be sent away would be along soon saw
there was no time to lose and fitting
himself out with some attention to personal
appearance he had gone to the rev
ollivant and offered to relieve him of all
anxiety as to tavaus future

the missionary could be hood-
winked and taken in by the dullest
native but he knew pretty much
about whites he was ordinarily a gentle
soothing soul with a hard substratum of
stubbornness however and a wholly un-
suspected ability to express himself in
anger

  he had blasted schwartz with the wrath
of the prophets and as eminently became
his calling he had spoken nothing but the
truth in telling schwartz that he was a
venomous hypocrite a secret-drinking
whisky barrel of iniquity that it were
better to lay any girl native or white in
her unhallowed grave than to give her
into his lecherous arms

  and in the course of his comments
however the rev ollivant disclosed the
information that tavau was not being sent
away because she was no longer loved in
the mission or because she was dis-
graced-for she was loved and she wasnt
disgraced-but because young rideout was
unreasonably set on marrying her against

m
ioo

adventure

the wishes and orders of his guardian
uncle but that if tavau were to be given
in marriage to anybody it would certainly
be to the young man who had beseeched
her hand with the light of purity in his
tearful eyes and a heart undefiled with
beastial lust

  schwartz had been rather bewildered
it is hard for a german to believe that
things can go otherwise than the way he
plans that they shall but it did dawn on
him finally that the missionary had an-
swered in the negative and returning to his
shack he had taken to his low-built bed with
a bottle of whisky

  the condolence delegation shied a few
shells against the matting that served as
walls to let schwartz know that it had
arrived

  oh schwartzy we come to dance at the
weddin that aint to be some one called

  too bad schwartz when you took a
bath and all that another contributed

  nobody loves a fat man another fiend
chanted and was loudly corrected by-
a fat christian shentleman you mean
gottdam go vay schwartz bellowed
growling and muttering

  a reply was what the condolence dele-
gation wanted and it jeered mocked and
taunted goading the big trader into fury

  but this sport soon grew stale schwartz
only repeated the same oaths and made
the same threats and the tormentors had
used up their jibes

 then somebody with a sense of the
dramatic called out convincingly

  oh schwartz young rideouts here
come on out and congratulate him be a
sport come on

  no answer followed but the muttering
stopped behind the mats

  rideout says if you dont leave his girl
alone hell tie your heels to the back of
your neck and leave you out in the bush
another imaginative fellow added

  a huge almost naked bushy-faced white
figure burst from the house

  vere iss he vere iss he schwartz
cried brandishing a large automatic

  there he is one of the thoughtless
grinning devils shouted pointing at a
sailor who had come along to see the fun and
who had stood discreetly in the back-ground

  at the first shot the sailor-an innocent
stranger to our port-went into the air
with a yell and came down some fifteen feet

away with steam up and sails crowded
and he traveled so fast that as one of the
fellows afterward said you had to throw
your glance about forty feet ahead to see
him go by

  schwartz floundered forward cursing
and shooting drunkenly he soon stopped
for breath and the lack of a target then
blundered back toward his shack calling
upon god to hear his oaths and strike him
dead if he failed to cut rideouts heart
away and eat it

  uh-huh said lean jake when he
heard of it it takes mighty little to make
a heathen mighty little in this climate
and that deutscher got murder in him
uh-huh

  the missionary ship having run for a week
before a gale arrived a day or two sooner
than was expected

  that afternoon lean jake sat on his sea-
chest oiling his long pearl-handled single-
action old revolver and as usual when
caring for the veteran companion of his
roaming days he was oddly silent it was
as though intercourse incommunicable to a
third party was passing between them
and despite its years in that land of torpid
dampness where metal oxidizes as quickly
as clothes mildew not a fleck or scar of rust
was on it

  from time to time he would go to the
doorway and view the weather with a sea-
mans eyes but he made no comment
until i hopefully suggested that it would
clear up he answered-

  youre right-worse luck and not
another word did i get out of him until
after sundown when he said casually
im going for a little walk maybe a
week fore im back maybe more maybe
a month

  it was a month or so before i really
understood but early the next morning
i had my suspicions

  young rideout and tavau had eloped
during the night and disappeared into the
bush

  there was a great to-do-much running
about and searching though the drizzle
had lasted until around midnight-when a
brilliant moon came out-there was not
much trouble in finding the trail but the
footprints of the boy and girl had vanished
as if by magic after a few miles the
vanishing point i surmised was where
jake had met them though a sailor and
heathens



a good one he was crafty in forest lore
whereas those two children if left to them-
selves would have splashed about miserably
all through the night and have been over-
taken shortly after sunrise they would
probably never have thought of wading
up-stream

  the search was hard and earnest buck
rideout offered twenty pounds to whoever
found his nephew the missionaries were
as agitated over tavau as they were over
the boy for though there were no cannibal
tribes living back in those hills canoes full
of them frequently blown out of their course
arrived from other islands sometimes from
long distances and held dances and feasts

  a large searching-party started out some
intent on the reward and others enjoying
the excitement the native boys scam-
pered gleefully through the brush and i
did not believe there was one among them
who if he had come upon the fugitives
would not have at once warned and aided
them it might have been different if
the boys minds could have visualized the
beads calico tobacco fishing hooks mir-
rors and ironware that twenty pounds
represented

  the searchers soon split into a score of
parlies rushing about in twos threes and
half-dozens and for the most part having a
lark of a time though the missionaries and
buck rideout were threatening and en-
treating

  near where the trail vanished i suddenly
came upon schwartz arguing earnestly with
iako a withered old bushman who though
peaceable enough held aloof from the one
god people but he had come along on
the search for the same reason that black
boys or white follow the crowd iako was
not liked by the missionaries-it being
reported that he was one of those ancient
fellows who made a practise of slipping
out through the forest to the hidden and
deserted shrines of the old tribal gods
and as i moved by unseen my listening ears
caught falling from schwartzs mouth
extravagant promises of tobacco and even
brandy for some service or other which
i did not hear mentioned

  it was a month before the search stopped
it never really stopped for to this day i
believe boys go slipping through the forest
wondering where are the bones of tavau
and her white lover but in even less than
a month the searchers lost hope evidence

that sent most everybody scampering back
out of possible dangers was found of war-
parties from savage islands

  their beached canoes had been seen in
the distance from the hill-tops and though
rideout ollivant and some of the mission-
aries from the ship with armed and braver
natives later went from one end of the
island to the other they could not come
upon either the savages whose canoes had
been seen from afar or traces of the boy
and girl it was supposed that young
rideout and tavau had been captured and
   one doesnt think of what happens
afterward

  during that time when there was much
excitement and so many parties were out
for days together the absence of any one
from the village was only casually noticed
if at all and was no cause for comment

  it was only when the searching was about
over and almost everybody was back and
loafing around as usual that the beach
began to wonder what had become of
schwartz and lean jake

  then i awoke one morning and found
jake who was about as noiseless as a cat
anyway stretched on his bunk

  a labor-recruiting schooner which did not
seem very anxious for nikos boys however
had slipped into the harbor during the night
and i judged that jake had come on her in
view of the fact that she was a stranger and
could not have got a pilot until moftiing she
would have had to wait outside if there had
not been somebody on board who knew the
reefs and channels as well as jake did

  it was some time before i could get him to
talk for days he wandered off or sat around
meditatively smoking sometimes staring out
across the sea at the strange schooner some-
times standing with arms folded behind him
and looking into the shadowy depths of the
forest that climbed up and up until it crested
the mountains

  on the fourth morning the recruiting-
schooner stood out to sea jake watched
her out of sight then called to me 

iii

i never knew lean jake to tell
a lie that i wouldnt have readily
told myself but i have sometimes
felt that his sense of the dramatic in his
narratives was never embarrassed by what
actually happened judge for yourself


adventure

  tavau had sent him a note several days
before the missionary ship had arrived
saying that she and rideout would elope
and take to the bush the first night that
the ship put into the harbor she knew
that it would be gone again in a few days
and would not return for three months
in the name of namoo her grandmother
to whom jake forty years before had given
a fighting allegiance she invoked his help-
and got it jake had already taken a strong
fancy to the boy and always he had been
tavaus slave

  as i had surmised he arranged to meet
them at a point where the trailers could not
possibly associate his footprints with theirs
they entered a stream and waded for miles
and hours until reasonably sure of having
evaded pursuit because the natives-all
except the bushmen who are rarely found
except on the larger islands-are not adepts
in forest lore then the little party struck
out over a pig trail

  at first tavau had drawn the calico
wrapper high and tucked it around her
waist to be out of the way of her legs
but it kept getting loose so she tore it off
and wound it into a short lava-lava when
the moon came out she snatched a handful
of scarlet flowers from an hibiscus and
stuck them into her hair then from some-
where in her memory there stirred the old
tribal songs of war and love that naima
her mother had chanted to her from the
time she first lay crooning on a mat and
as the moon lifted itself to the dome of the
sky she rushed into a grassy open space
and leaped about swaying her body and
throwing her hands to the rhythm of the
wild songs

  rideout stood and watched her he had
never seen anything like it then the
magic of the moon of youth and love and
the joy of having her at last loosened his
bashfulness before jake and he began to
sing out and playfully to sway the ax he
carried-to build their nest with back in
the bush he had told jake he tried to
catch her and soon he was leaping about
and whooping almost as madly as she

  around and around they circled and spun
wild with youth and love and instinctively
celebrating their joy in that same bounding
play and rhythmic shouting that no doubt
startled the newly-created animals in the
forests of eden when the father and mother
of us all first awoke and found themselves

alive then tired exhausted they sprang
at each other with open arms and they
sank to the grass gripped in a mutually
tense embrace and lay panting with mouth
against mouth

   t was safe as any place for the night
jake explained and they was too tired
for the damp to hurt em so i got in a dry
spot under a banyan and dozed off

  the next morning the boy and girl said
that they were too stiff and sore to move
and coaxed jake to let them rest in the
warm sun so knowing that the searching-
party had not had time to get within range
of the sound he shot a pig for breakfast
and the first word that popped from
tavaus laughing bps as he brought it in
was bokolo-instantly with her warning
eyes she told jake not to let the boy know
what it meant long pig is a cannibals
anglicized euphemism for human flesh and
bokolo is the natives word for the same
thing

  tavau threw away the drab wet tom
calico and wove herself a heavy garland
of leaves-a kind of lava-lava and when
jake left them to climb a peak nearby and
scan the coast on the opposite side of the
island from the village she was making
fun of rideouts mud - spattered tom
stained white duck trousers and her
nimble fingers were busy on a lava-lava of
pandanus leaves-for him

  when jake came back schwartz lay on
the grass his head cleft to the chin and
the boy naked but for the girdle of leaves
about his loins was squatting over the
bloody ax and staring dully at the dead
man

  tavau vainly petted and praised and
scolded but the boys brain was numbed
the knowledge of what he had done over-
powered and stupefied that unhardened
sensitive mind schooled ancestrally for a
thousand years in the commandment-
thou shalt not kill

  iako was squatting beside him grinning
ecstatically with bared toothless gums and
cackling praise

  im fella stop along palienti goot kaikai
the old savage shouted at jake and pointed
to the corpse

  he had suggested that one horrible and
nearly unmentionable thing that makes the
blood of even the most evil white man run
cold-kaikai is to eat

  jake would have killed iako on the spot-
heathens



and came near to doing it-if tavau had
not begun to pour out the story which
told how that grinning old savage had after
all really saved rideouts life iako had
explained it all to her

  schwartz had hired iako to trail them
down for him and had made no secret of
the hope to kill rideout on sight precious
little iako cared whether one white man
killed another schwartz had promised
big pay in terms that iako could under-
stand and the old bushman had merely
followed up-stream mile after mile until
his sharp eyes found their trail leaving the
water as he had known he must find it
eventually if he did not overlook the mark-
ings and a bushman overlooks nothing

  but as they sneaked upon the boy and
girl iako had heard tavau chanting one of
the old old fetish songs and coming closer
lie had seen rideout leaping about as iako
himself had leaped before many a maiden
in the long ago he was an exile a lone-
some outlander among the christianized
natives of niko and the thought had burst
within his head that if the one god
people took converts from natives maybe
the old gods that he still worshiped could
be restored to power and prestige by taking
converts from the whites

  schwartz evidently aware that he was
a poor shot seemed intent on creeping as
close as he could before firing

  iako suddenly jerked the gun from his
hand and screamed a warning at the same
time darting away and attempting to shoot
schwartz but it was a bewitched weapon
-an automatic with an unreleased safety
of which the old savage knew nothing

  schwartz was badly frightened and had
started to run but when tavau tauntingly
leaped near him he had turned snatched
up a heavy stick cut for the fire and dashed
at rideout

  the boy who never in his life had had
other than a playground fight stood help-
less aghast but tavau sprang between
them and tugged at the powerful germans
arm

  schwartz shifted the club and held her
passionately pulling her up to his bearded
mouth

  she screamed

  then young rideout wildly caught op the
ax and struck

  in her struggles against schwartz tavau
had torn the shirt from his breast and as

he lay on the grass there was exposed on
his right side just below the ribs a long
uneven scar as though-years before-a
jagged weapon had torn at his abdomen

  jake hurried them away as isoon as pos-
sible not because he was afraid they would
be found-for only an accident or eyes
sharp as iakos could bring any one to that
particular spot-but because he had sighted
a canoe on the distant beach and besides
he felt that the boy would go mad if he
stared much longer at the dead man

       that night jake left rideout who
teas was even then a little out of his
ljzsihead and tavau well back in the
bush while he and iako crept forward in the
moonlight to see who had come in the canoe
and what they were doing

  it was pretty near as he had suspected
and exactly as he had guessed when iakos
sharp eyes identified the gorged sleeping
figures lying about on the beach as tribes-
men from an island slightly east of niko
who held an inveterate grudge against the
santa cruzians a big raid had been made
on santa cruz and scores of prisoners taken
from the quosoli tribe but a heavy gale
coming up on the trip home the fleet of
war-canoes had been scattered and the
warriors in this one dashed from their
course and hungry had put in at the north-
western shore of niko to hold a feast

  prisoners had evidently been plentiful
for six were left alive securely tied and
stretched in a row while about them the
food-drunken guards slept like the rest of
the war-party

  iako and jake cut the prisoners loose
then with difficulty convinced them that
it was dangerous to try to slaughter the
sleeping enemies that would be aroused
if a single blow wounded instead of killed

  tavau and rideout were brought down
to the canoe which was shoved off without
so much as a yell from the stranded warriors
who anyway were likely enough picked
up in a day or two by other members of
the scattered war-fleet

  the quosoli a bad lot themselves made
straight for home and a favorable wind
helped them along jake remained awake
most of the time alertly on watch for
though the quosoli said that they were
grateful a quosoli is likely to say many
things that he does not mean

  tavau was frantic with worry over


adventure

rideout who sat for hours on hours with
an idiotic stare in his eyes she argued
and scolded and like a true maid of the
south seas was unashamed to show before
the crew how intensely she loved the boy

  commandeering what mats there were
to make him comfortable seizing the nearly
empty bamboo water-pipes and telling the
thirsty crew to drink out of the ocean she
fussed over him like a mother over a sick
baby and all the while she drew won-
derful pictures of the idyllic life they would
live in the bush of santa cruz and some-
times at night when the air was cool
stirred a flicker of response with her
caresses and buoyant words

  also hour after hour old iako sat clucking
and chattering happy to be among people
who worshiped gods that could be seen
and talked to and not a vague fellow top-
side the sky bowl

  they reached the island of the quosoli
whose village sets at bundy bay-bloody
bay it is often called and which in spite
of the massacres that had taken place was
often visited by labor-recruiters

  the party no sooner landed than the
savages brandishing spears and seven-foot
bows wanted to eat the foreigners black
and white but the returning quosoli
explained to a little wizened old chief
whose mummy-like chest was covered by
the insignia of rank-a white disk large
as a dinner-plate cut from a giant clam
shell-and he took them as his guests
that is he took all except iako whom so
jake thought they promptly carried off
and cooked for he was not seen again
and that night a big feast was held for the
returned warriors

  moreover tonogo the chiefs eldest son
a stalwart fellow twice his fathers size with
a stone ring big as a doughnut through his
nose came around smacking his greasy lips
and staring amorously at tavau while he
proffered a revolting hunk of steaming meat
on a tray of fresh plantain leaves jake
said that he could tell by the odor that it
wasnt pork

  tavau merely ignored him at first then as
he persisted tearing away a piece of the meat
with his fingers and pressing it against her
mouth her temper flared and she angrily told
him to go away but her blazing anger only
made her the more beautiful for her bare
breast heaved and the bright eyes snapped
as her head was thrown back haughtily

  tonogo grinned dropped the piece of
meat into his own mouth and stared ad-
miringly while he leisurely chewed on it

  he turned to jake and said in the
wretched patois that natives conceive as
being english

  bimeby me fella kaikai englis fella
make mary stop along tonogo you fella
stop along him

 and having some humor in him he
laughed but not pleasantly for he evi-
dently meant what he said i e that when
the time came and he got ready he would
kill the boy rideout and jake too then
take the girl

  rideout was sick and fairly out of his
head tonogo could see that he went
away then came back with a witch-doctor
whom tavau would not let get within an
arms length of the boy-not even when the
old chief himself strangely solicitous over
his guest appeared and assured her that
this particular witch-doctor held high
powers of life and death

  which was pretty much so jake said
for there be no slicker poisoners than the
quosoli devil-devil doctors

  jake surmised that the old chief was
cunningly hospitable to them because he
the chief had reason to believe that a brit-
ish gunboat was coming along in the slow
but angry way that british gunboats have
of coming after a missionary has been killed
and jake gathered from words dropped
here and there that a new missionary had-
as usual among the quosoli-been killed
some three months before but that the
chief hoped the government would
believe he had died of dysentery especially
if two white men were found alive and well
treated in the tribe

  the quosoli are dirty treacherous amaz-
ingly cunning and as ugly-faced as a race
of poisoners are likely to be they are
notoriously inveterate cannibals filthy and
lazy and on the first night jake overheard
tavau praying impatiently in english to
the one god to make her boy well so she
could have him and to send plenty hell-fire
and like-job-boils on the dirty witch-
doctor that brought crushed spiders in a
skull bowl to smear the sick boy with
and very emphatic was her request that a
similar visitation plague tonogo who had
squatted around talking love while she sat
fanning the feverish face of the boy that
had her heart she further called attention
heathens



to the fact that this was a no-good island and
that she wanted plenty quick to get off it

  the next morning she told jake the same
thing she was sure that the boy was
going to die if he did not get away there
was also much more dangerous than mere
illness to be feared but he was worse
too-he was weak and crazy as a bat

  tonogo came around and grinningly
touched the ringlet of hair he had twisted
with fiber cord so that it dangled stiffly
down the side of his face and he said some-
thing which jake did not catch but
tavau turned almost pale

  the twisted ringlet indicated that be-
tween midnight and dawn tonogo had taken
an inexorable vow one that he could never
forget with that ringlet dangling remind-
ingly against the side of his face one that
he must accomplish or perish in the attempt
and the ringlet could never be cut until the
vow was fulfilled

  tavau did not send him away that
morning he squatted beside her and
talked she laughed a few times flies
settled undisturbed on rideouts face as
she looked half-smilingly into tonogos
the next morning they went off together
and were gone most of the day

  jake said that the savage in her just oozed
out and covered her from that time on

  the following night there was another
feast-a stray bushman had been caught-
and against jakes urging tavau decked
herself out in flowers and threaded shells
and joined the dancing girls

  after that jake heard no more prayers
to the one god nor further complaints
about the no-good island and she was the
wildest heathen on the beach though
occasionally she would rush in with tonogo
glowering at her heels and stroke rideouts
face for a moment begging him to recognize
her

  jake said it was a clever play to heighten
tonogos jealousy-and it did

  jake tried to guard rideout night and
day even picking out the green cocoanuts
from which he drank lest tonogo aided
by the witch-doctor might poison the boy
if a missionary could die of dysentery
after being brained by a war club why not
this stranger if he passed out quietly under
the witch-doctors charm jake would
still have been left to show the govern-
ment that the quosoli did not harm white
men

but a labor-recruiter put into the
bay before the gunboat the skip-
per was new to the south seas but
he was careful as most men had to be in
those days if they grew old and he did
not come on shore at all but parleyed
with the disarmed natives on his deck
when they swarmed into the roped-off
quarters

  the old chief firmly refused to let jake
go on board or even go down to the beach
where he might be seen from the ship and
a guard headed by tonogo himself was put
over the hut rideout could hardly stand
on his feet so there was little fear of his
getting in range of the white mans magic
eyes-binoculars tavau could go where
she pleased

  tonogo as if to make assurance doubly
sure regarding jake sent him and tlie guard
back into the bush and clear out of sight of
the village

  jake was certain that he would find
rideout dead when he returned for it
seemed too favorable a chance for tonogo
to overlook but jake knew there was no
possibility of evading the watchful savages
he propped himself against a palm bole
and sat there motionless until late in the
afternoon when another party of warriors
joined that which had squatted sus-
piciously around him then he was told
to get up and come with them and as
though afraid that he might make trouble
several of the savages took the pains to
keep their spears near his back

  they rushed him along the neck of
land circling the harbor ordered him into
a canoe and made him lie down then set
out frantically for the schooner which was
getting under way he could get no
answers for his questions though he knew
very well that somebody was fooling with
the orders of the old chief who had not
wanted the labor-recruiters to think white
men could live overnight among the
quosoli he wanted the gunboat to think
so but labor-recruiters were discouraged
in every way

  the schooner hove to and waited

   the skipper looking over the side showed
no surprise at seeing a white man in the
bottom of the canoe

  as soon as jake went over the ladder the
skipper explained that he had only pre-
tended to stand out to sea to make the
niggers hurry and fetch you adding that
io

adventure

the sick white boy was already on board-
thereby drawing a volley of questions from
the amazed jake

  the skipper said that tavau and a big
buck with a green bracelet hanging from
his nose and a pigtail of wool bobbing down
the side of his face had been out to the
schooner that morning and wanted to know
if he the skipper would take away two
white men

  the skipper said that nothing but an
affidavit from a priest would make him
really believe that two white men were
alive on the island but the girl had spoken
english quite clearly and judging from her
unusual beauty and the jealous eyes of
the big nigger she spoke pretty much the
truth the skipper said that she had
laughed and affectionately patted the big
blacks arm from time to time as he stood
by her listening watchfully but unable to
catch more than a word here and there
if even so much

  tavau told the skipper that tonogo
son of the chief had vowed to have her
as his woman or kill the two white men
but that he was willing to let them escape
if she married him because the old chief
would make a roar if they were killed but
not quite so big a roar if they escaped-
which seemed to the skipper from all he
had heard about the island a complete
reversal of quosoli psychology

  tavau said that she loved both white
men the lean one because he had been
good to her grandmother from which the
skipper-much to jakes disgust-got the
impression that jake had given the old
lady plenty of tobacco in her toothless
dotage but that she loved the young
handsome one because he was him and
it couldnt be helped but that he was
terribly bad off now and was going to be
worse off if he got well therefore it was
all right to marry tonogo plenty-quick
which wasnt so bad in a way because he
would soon be chief and she could always
kill him if he wasnt good to her-but he
would be for as the skipper could see he
had a kind handsome face

  and the skipper said to jake that it was
only something that he didnt quite under-
stand in the girls eyes that kept him from
laughing outright he swore that for an
instant he saw tears there but jake scorn-
fully told him that when he had been below
the line forty-odd years he would know that

heathens never shed tears not even when
they cried all night the skipper finally
compromised with the suggestion that
maybe it was tobacco smoke or something
that had got in her eyes for a moment for
after all it couldnt have been real tears
because she laughed right away after she
said it

  she had done another queer thing too
for though she spoke english almost like
a white girl she had lapsed into the traders
argot understood by natives from the
solomons to the carolines to tell the
skipper that she did not like the one god
any more because she had prayed to him
and tonogo had had the witch-man do his
praying to the quosoli gods and they
were the more powerful for hadnt he got
what he asked for and she failed so that
now she loved tonogo very much

  then as she and the big buck started to
leave the ship she had asked the skipper
for his knife and he gave it to her thinking
she wanted it as a present-the natives
are always begging something or other-
but she took it and quickly cut off the
dangling pig-tail of hair on the big buck
niggers head and tonogo had grinned
approvingly then she offered the knife
back to the skipper who however told her
to keep it and they climbed over the side
into the waiting canoe and shoved off

  broth and medicine from the ships chest
brought rideout around to a bit of strength
and his senses in a few days but he could
not forget schwartz at any hour of the day
or night though he did not remember
hardly anything after the fight up in the
hills

  he wanted tavau

  he would not be quiet when he found
that she was not on the ship and nearly
went out of his head again when jake told
him how tonogo had roused the wild blood
in her so that she had gone right back to
devil-devil dancing and idol-worship like
her wild grandmothers before her

  i always thought tavau was different
jake said tenderly to the boy i did for
a fact but being forty-odd years down
here i ought t have known better once
a heathen always a heathen-and her
having such a grandmother and mother
anyhow it takes too long for religion to
soak through black skins and get down
where it does a lot o good its been
soaking in the hides of us whites for two
heathens



thousand-odd years and it aint reached
all our hearts yet but its live and learn
my boy-an learnin costs a lot o brain-
aches and unweeped tears-specially in this
climate

  now schwartz was just a drunken
deutscher just pretend i killed him id
a-done it and with joy so dont let that
worry you none and tavau-she was
just a nigger and she fooled us all just like
women does no matter what their color
is

  a labor-trade or recruiting schooner
travels pretty much to suit itself and the
skipper dropped some two hundred miles
off his course to bring jake and rideout
to niko

  but rideout did not come on shore

  jake had gone over and had a talk with
the uncle and buck was mad and had a
good deal to say but all things con-
sidered he agreed with jake that it was
best for niko not to learn what had hap-
pened and after buck had gone on board
to see the boy he thought maybe the boy
would be just as well off with a cousin back
in liverpool who had wanted to bring him
up in his business and buck made
arrangements with the skipper to see that
the boy got to sydney from where he could
take a boat home

iv

      that was the story as jake told
      it to me

         but a few days later a british
gunboat put into niko after a visit to
bloody bay over in the santa cruz group

  the sailors that gathered at the shanty
bar said that they had not shelled the
village because they found that the mission-

ary hadnt been killed at all but had died
of dysentery-just like lots of fool mission-
aries do and then their friends make a howl
to the government and say cannibals
ate em

  why the sailors had found the quosoli
the friendliest tribe anywhere true their
experience with natives was not great
because their gunboat had only recently
been sent into the south seas for duty
but they guessed they knew when even
riggers were friendly

  but a funny thing had happened a day
or two before they got there the pretty
young wife of the chiefs son had killed
herself-driven a knife right into her heart
and everybody in the tribe was afraid to
touch her body-funny thing-because
never in the memory of the oldest man
in the tribe had a woman done that-
killed herself you know and there she lay
right on the mat in a new hut the chiefs
son had just built-still beautiful she was
though two days dead in that climate

  a party from the gunboat had given her
a decent burial and the captain had said
a prayer because he was a religious man
and believed heathens had souls more-
over he had been overheard saying to his
first officer that anybody could see that she
was different from the quosoli women
but none of the natives would talk about
her or where or how or when she came
because she was tapoo-a woman who had
killed herself

  and the sailors drinking there in the
shanty bar appealed to jake to know if
in his forty-odd years he had ever heard of
such a thing before

  but jake staring dully straight ahead of
him got up and went out into the night
and did not answer

wim cameron a blond giant of
a man whose reputation as a
forest-ranger was second only to
that of jo martins rested on
one elbow in the sweet june grass and sur-
veyed his long powerful limbs complacently
as his gaze shifted to martin his compan-
ion on many a scout his mouth twitched
with a little smile then hardened martin
slight of build and several inches under
camerons stature sat with his lithe body
curving forward over his knees and was
staring at the toes of his moccasins his
dark features wore an expression of deep
dejection

  all day the two had lounged about the
blanchard cabin standing guard till
blanchard returned from the little mill at
devens farms inside the open door
betty blanchard tossed her pretty head as
she helped her mother and proudly told
herself there was not another girl on all
the new york frontier in this summer of
s who could boast two such cavaliers

  both men knew the girl was a coquette
and loved her the more distractedly for the
tantalizing fault and both inwardly vowed
their loitering should end once blanchard
returned for with the father to act as
intermediary the girl would be brought
to book and announce her choice border
wooings were bruskly terminated at
times in these stirring days when sir
henry clinton was retreating from phila-
delphia to new york with general wash-
ington at his heels big cameron was
confident the girl was as good as his wife
martin believed the same but would not

withdraw until told as much by the maid

  think ill scout up oriskany way again
aint been there since we had the brush with
the mohawks lazily remarked cameron
after a long silence go along

  before the girl came between them this
question would not have been put each
taking it for granted the two of them must
follow the same trail

  dont think so jerkily replied martin
without lifting his head mebbe ill drift
out michlimacknac way

  camerons pleasant face clouded for a
moment he and martin had had some
rare old times together of course old ties
must loosen when a ranger settled down
with a wife but lord how the trail would
call him in the years to come then he
caught a flutter of bettys skirts as she
switched by the door and he could only
think of the maid another period of
silence and then both men were on their
feet bowing and scraping only to find
it was the mother and not the girl mrs
blanchard smiled and the girl snickered
inside the cabin

  look after betty while i go up to
cottons said mrs blanchard dont
let the injuns carry her off

  the whole iroquois league cant harm
a hair of her head cried big cameron

  i reckon shell be here when you git
back quietly assured martin

  with a smile for each to show her im-
partiality mrs blanchard walked up the
river trail that led to the nearest neighbors
and the two men still standing looked at
each other coldly


a new keeper of the wampum



  martin spoke first saying

  cameron weve followed our last trail
together im tired of uncertainties lets
have it settled

  cameron dropped into the grass re-
plying-

  im in no hurry

  i am grimly retorted martin and the
face he showed at the door was haggard
and determined betty come here and
settle something for us he peremptorily
demanded

  all their words had fed through the small
square hole serving as a window perhaps
the girl resented martins arbitrary tone
and manner anyway there were danger
signals in her cheeks as she appeared in the
doorway and with hands on her hips bent
her gaze on the two men martin although
usually nonplussed in her presence desper-
ately requested

  which is it betsy him or me lets
have it settled and done with

  the girls eyes snapped ominously and
she oldly returned-

  lor jo martin i never knew any-
thing had been commenced

  mebbe not that means two fools
stead of one but heres cameron who
i fetched here last winter heres me
whos been coming here for a year every
chance i could git which ones wasting
his time say which shall stop coming
i never asked either of you to come
here she slowly answered quite a few
forest -rangers go up and down the schoharie
and stop to see us the trails open at both
ends for them that want to come-for them
whore keen to go

  cameron chuckled martins dark face
grew hot and he declared-

  well the trails closed for me unless
you say for jim cameron to stay away
oblivious to the fact a new world was
being created from the primeval solitudes
that the destiny of a continent was being
indexed by such sturdy characters as they
the girl braced her slender shoulders and
sharply informed

  itll never be for you nor no man to
say who shall come and who shall keep
clear of blanchards mister cameron has
more sense than to talk that way

  cameron choked martin his eyes
growing lurid under the taunting smile of
the big fellow he checked himself with
difficulty and muttered so its cameron

eh threes a crowd ill be going
but jo youre acting silly she pro-
tested as he turned away aint jim
cameron always been your friend cant
you see its wicked for you two to fall out
this way

  i aint doing any falling out defended
cameron feeling a trifle uneasy at the
thought of walking the forests alone after
all the years of martins companionship

  over his shoulder martin passionately
shot back

  he was my friend till i fetched him here
he knew how i felt but that didnt bother
him any once hed seen you

  if youre going to look at it that way
jo martin why should anything bother
me cried cameron think you can go
through the world and blaze trees what
take your liking and expect folks not to
touch em even if you cant chop em down
now youve put a name to it ill say that
since i seen betty nothing else can ever
count

  martin made no response but dropped
his long rifle across his left arm and hurried
up the trail his cup of misery overflowing

the gracious warmth of the june
sun could not dispel the blighting
paralysis from the valleys of the
mohawk and schoharie only the blanch-
ard and cotton families remained in this
section and they had been repeatedly
warned to fall back to the settlements

  aside from their anglo-saxon tenacity
to start a harvest the seasonal assurance of
fecundity found no crops planted no
hopeful husbandmen were plying the ad-
vantage of the month from fondas bush
to the eastern waters of the susquehanna
a strange apathy rested on the land and
fields grew rank with trash orchards
blossomed with no chance of being har-
vested while spiders spun webs in the
doorways of abandoned homes

  dread of the iroquois had put a stop to all
peaceful pursuits along the border fear
of the long house and their white allies
had brought a hush to the country and
only those were abroad who fought for or
against king george upon his throne
mothers quieted their childrens whimper-
ing by whispering the one word iroquois
troublous times a strange time for
wooing a maid with the brooding calm
more wearing on mens nerves than the
no

adventure

crash of actual battle the few border
folks who dwelt outside the forts such as
the blanchards and cottons might well
tremble of nights and expect to hear the
pattering reconnaissance of the red men
followed by their horrible screams as they
sounded the doom of their victims

  according to martins views however
the times were not out of joint he was
accustomed to these waves of terror
settlers alternately flocked to their little
farms and fled in terror to the nearest
garrison post indians always had been
a factor in the rangers life and their
depredations could scarcely interfere with
flights of amiable fancy

  now he was flogged on by one wild desire
to leave the country and in new regions and
amid new perils strive to forget his mind
boiled with rage at cameron and he cursed
the winters day he had led the giant to
the blanchard cabin prior to that betty
had been glad enough to see him he was
enraged at the girl too for playing with
his love if cameron had been wiped out
in that last fight on the oriskany-but that
was too evil a thought especially seeing it
was useless

  he had been an hour on the trail when
the pounding of hoofs ahead aroused him
from his black thoughts he drew aside
dully wondering who might be riding so
hard and fast with an exclamation of
alarm he jumped to the middle of the trail
and raised his hand for her to stop for it
was mrs blanchard she pointed behind
her and gestured for him to run back and
there was the glare of insanity in her
eyes

  behind her ran one of the cotton boys
striving to cling to the stirrup and his face
was ghastly with fright as mrs blanch-
ard swept by screaming something the
ranger did not catch the boy tripped and
sprawled at his feet on swept horse and
rider

  yanking the boy to his feet martin
shook him fiercely and stilled his blubbering
when he could speak the lad gasped

  iroquois devens farms the miller
and blanchard killed millers hired man
made our cabin and fetched the word
our famblys started for the settlement
father give mrs blanchard the hoss to
git home im to go with em the red
hellions will be along any minute

  he broke off and with a faint scream

pointed up the trail then turned and
scuttled off

  martin beheld a shaft of smoke slowly
rising above the forest crown the iro-
quois had reached the cotton clearing and
were at work the tragedy made him
forget his own troubles blanchard dead

it seemed impossible he always had
liked the man he carefully selected a
position on the river-bank and slipped
several inlets into his mouth they
would come down the trail and if he could
hold them back a bit mrs blanchard and
betty would stand a good chance of
escaping

  the volume of smoke increased and he
thought the faint breeze brought on its
fragrant breath the sound of triumphant
yells but it might have been the murmur-
ing of the river minutes passed each
sixty seconds adding to the fugitives
security then with much awkward plunging
a cow came down the trail behind her ran
two savages their painted faces making
them devils martin picked off the rear-
most with a ball through his shaven head
but before he could reload and bag the
other a rifle cracked near-by and the fleeing
savage crashed on his face

  martin looked round and beheld cam- i
eron reloading

  the women he barked

  making east with the boy they know
the way thought i could do more good
up here

  you oughter gone with em growled
martin

  guess i know what to do when it comes
to taking care of betty snarled the big
fellow

  you can go to-after this is over

i never lowed to fight by your side agin
growled martin

  camerons big face grimaced with rage
then he clicked a bullet against his white
teeth and glared up the trail now they
were coming a hideous whooping throng
with the leader wildly brandishing a gray
scalp martin shuddered and prayed betty
might never see it and forthwith bowled
over the bearer a second later cameron
brought down another but instead of
holding back the iroquois came on taking
a chance there were but two and knowing
they would not have time to reload

  martin ducked low and ran toward them
rising and discharging his two pistols into
a new keeper of the wampum

in

their midst and throwing them into con-
fusion but cameron relying on his great
strength rushed up the open trail bellowing
like a bull and using his rifle for a club and
breaking it on a skull at the first swing
an indian landed on martins back and a
hand clutched his scalplock ducking low
he threw his assailant over his head and
knifed him just as another warrior dashed
into him full-tilt he glimpsed cameron
going down beneath a mass of savages
then rolled into the river taking his assail-
ant with him

      martin lay in the bush with his
rifle covering the doorway of the
blanchard cabin he knew betty
and her mother reached schenectady he
believed cameron must have died that day
in the ttail although he had found no
determining proof after searching the woods
from devens farms to this clearing while
he prowled through forest and deserted
farmsteads he had felt guilty of trying on a
dead mans shoes were he positive cam-
eron were alive he would have lost no time
in making for far-off michilimackinac
now the cabin held his attention because
he had detected a movement inside he
hoped it might be a straggling iroquois
bent on loot

  again something stirred inside and a
sudden horror enveloped him what if
big cameron had escaped and like him-
self had wandered back to his sweethearts
home the girl was in dutch schenectady
and if cameron be alive and here   
the ranger tried to push the thought from
him yet all the time telling himself that
should the big fellow die on the doorsill
of the abandoned cabin it would be charged
up to the iroquois

  he had accepted his loss of the girl as
final till after the fight in the trail when
he took it for granted his former friend had
gone to his death believing that he had
permitted a bit of hope to grow up in
his heart but if intuition were right and
cameron were here   and again he
endeavored to retreat deeper into the bush
and away from the horrible temptation
something in his soul shrieked out for him
to kill the beastly thought while louder and
louder his mad love dinned in his ears-

  with cameron dead you may win her

  a figure began drawing toward the
doorway and a familiar coonskin cap

emerged from the shadows the cap cam-
eron wore the day blanchard was killed
with a loud groan martin threw down his
rifle and clenched his hands and thrust the

bloody opportunity from him

  whos there asked a voice

  with a gasp of incredulity martin
crawled from cover and glared at the pale
face and sorrow-filled eyes of betty blan-
chard and she was wearing the cap cam-
eron had left behind when he ran up the
trail to check the onrush of the iroquois
recognizing him she lowered the rifle she
had held in readiness and demanded-

  jo martin wheres your friend jim
cameron

  he plucked at the fringe of his hunting-
shirt and tried to find words she con-
tinued 

  you two were together the day the
injuns came where is he

  i dont know he went down with a
dozen on top of him he dully answered
dead probly i had troubles of my own
bout that time

  he is not dead she astounded him by
informing he was taken alive i want
to know where hes held prisoner he was
last heard of at cayuga castle

  at gayagaanhe exclaimed martin
who says that

  black bear the friendly oneida my
father saved from freezing two winters
ago he talked with me in schenectady
he was carrying dispatches from colonel
gansevoort at fort stanwix he said one
of our oneida scouts brought the news
to stanwix he must be rescued he
must be ransomed

  and she sank down in the doorway as
though very weak

  ransomed theyd rather have him
than all the goods and rum a dozen bateaus
could float up the mohawk

  he must be freed she muttered in a
peculiar little sing-song he fought that
mother and me might escape black bear
said they would probably take him to
onondaga-for the torture oh that must
not be that must not be i went to the
officers in schenectady they could do
nothing so i came here thinking to find
some of our rangers we have a little
store of silver in albany well give it
all gladly to get him free

  he thought rapidly while she was speak-
ing had he not met her cameron would


adventure

have been done to death at onondaga
without his knowledge and in the course
of time she would learn to welcome his love
now he believed he must drive a bargain
or lose the one chance

  he looked aside to escape her clear gaze
and doggedly began-

  whatll you give to have cameron
rescued

  anything was the prompt answer
which means nothing but a little silver
see here betty ive hated cameron ever
since he came between you and me if
the iroquois take him to onondaga and
he still lives there is one small chance for
him providing the man who goes to get
him uses the scheme i have in my head
and is willing to risk the stake if that
man goes and fails there will be two fires
lighted in front of the council-house instead
of one

  she shivered at his words and twisted her
hands convulsively

  i cant send a man to his death she
muttered

  if the price is right for his going and
he goes and fails he cant find no fault
its part of the bargain-the price if he
wins

  i dont understand what you mean
still refusing to meet her gaze he hoarsely
completed

  with what i know of onondaga coupled
to the plan simmering in my mind id stand
a better chance of fetching him out then
any man i know of but i have my price
if i git him clear will you forget you ever
loved him and marry me

  she eyed him wildly for nearly a minute
then whispered-

  youd-youd make me marry you even
if i liked some one else better

  his tanned face burned with shame but
he doggedly replied

  i aint making any one marry me
were talking of ransoming cameron
the injuns wont dicker you can ransom
him from me if i fail you pay no price
ill take you to stanwix and you can offer
all yours and your mothers silver to the
men there for them to go and git him
none will try to earn the price and
gansevoort will send you down the mohawk
to schenectady on the first bateau

  only three days ago two soldiers
were butchered within sight of the garrison
night and day they prowl about the fort

and even our oneidas keep close to cover
you can reckon how much worse it would
be to try and sneak into onondaga and
yet it might be done-but i know of no
man but myself who would try it let alone
doing it and i dont want your silver
youd make a woman marry you she
fiercely cried

  the scorn in her voice stung him to
greater passion

  id make you he gritted you
seemed to like me till i brought him here
then you picked him then you sent me
packing youve had your way picking
and choosing cameron would do the
same as i if our positions was swapped
round didnt he say that after seeing
you that nothing else counted well hes
trapped why should i risk my hair for
the man whos bested me in the only game
i ever set my heart on winning 

  but to take a woman that wayl she
moaned

  if its the only way and the woman is
you-yes

  and id always hate you for it she
passionately cried you ought to feel
ashamed enough to die for saying such
things to me you must be mad ill go
to stanwix surely therell be one man
there red or white

  and be sent down the river under guard
to your mother and meanwhile the
iroquois will be roasting cameron

  dont dont she begged clapping her
hands to her face to shut out some vision

  a fury seized upon him as he observed
her grief for cameron he wanted to
punish her for preferring cameron and
began babbling

  theyll cut off his finger-nails with clam-
shells theyll make him last for days
and-

  she leaped to her feet and clutched him
by the wrists and in a broken voice cried
are you a devil mohawk or seneca
aye look away from me arid never look at
a decent woman again listen to me
for you cant stop your ears as you hide
your eyes ill not go to stanwix to be
sent down the river ill go to onondaga
ill go after cameron myself and if i die
the iroquois cant be more cruel than you
have been

  her anguish brought him to his senses
and his better self as he stole a glance
at her hard set face a new fear gripped
a new keeper of the wampum



him she had her fathers spirit and did
she determine to enter the gloomy depths
of the onondaga woods no one could pre-
vent her

  i have been mad he faintly confessed
but it was all for love of you betty
blanchard for my poor love for you
ill go after cameron-and there shall be
no price

sir william johnson former
indian superintendent for the crown
and a mighty influence in the long
house was dead these four years by
dying at the outbreak of the revolutionary
war he had escaped the necessity of making
the great decision which the war would
have demanded of him whether he would
have cast his lot with the royal govern-
ment which had given him his all or would
have swung his red brood to the defense
of the colonies he so loved or would have
essayed to hold his fierce children neutral
who can say he died when the summer
was mellow and warm along the mohawk
hastened to his grave his friends believed
by the question ever confronting his soul

  could his spirit return to his old haunts
this mid-summer day he would have found
to be widely scattered the dusky race that
had given gentle names to wood and
stream from the sacondaga to the genesee
for more than three centuries the iroquois
were the romans of the new world con-
quering colonizing and assimilating and
yet not entirely roman for there was a
suggestion of the saxon in their federal
system of government their care to prevent
a concentration of power and their efforts
to develop the individual and promote
personal liberty if not for the coming of
the white race they would have shared the
western world with the aztecs

  but the fallen fortunes of the long house
interested jo martin none as he stole
through the interlacing lights and shadows
of the silent forest that a mighty race
was fighting its last fight never dawned
upon his intelligence as he scanned the
damp forest floor for the imprint of a hostile
moccasin even had his mind been re-
ceptive to philosophical musings he would
have deemed it madness to suggest that
race language and history were virtually
doomed to extinction within the life of three
generations

  the ranger was purely objective his

thoughts refused to quit the girl betty
his wicked madness had passed from him
and he knew it was better for him to join
cameron at the stake than to leave any
trick untried he had behaved mon-
strously and only the rescue of cameron
could palliate his offense he passed near
enough to fort stanwix to hear the dull
pur-r-r of a drum then turned south to
avoid the skulking savages he knew were
fringing the post it was not till several
miles from stanwix and well within hostile
country that he became conscious of being
trailed

  he must have made his discovery sub-
consciously for one moment he was flitting
down a forest aisle his heart in an ache for
the wrong he had done betty blanchard
and the next he was behind a tree he had
heard nor seen nothing that he knew of
yet the moment he was behind the tree
he was noiselessly working his way under
a tangle of wild-grape vines and rejoicing
to find his body slipping down a declivity
completing the descent he found himself
in a little gulley and at once started to run
along this

  when he deemed it prudent to emerge
from the gulley he took time to wonder
why his tracker had not sounded an alarm
as he mulled over this puzzling phase of
the situation an indian brave suddenly
stepped before him and raised an empty
hand in a token of well-meaning before
martin could think to take the defensive
his startled eyes noted the painted oneida
totem on the savages chest and in great
relief asked-

  why does the black bear of the oneidas
follow his white brother

  the white girl whose eyes are the color
of the cornflower asked the bear to find
the white man who dares walk alone
through the long house the black
bear owes a life to the father of the white
girl he met her on the mohawk she
grows thin like a starved deer and white
like the first snow she said -find and give
this talk to the white man who goes to
find the man cameron 

  as he spoke this in the oneida tongue
he produced from his paint-bag a small
roll of birchbark tied with a blue ribbon
and martins heart skipped a beat at the
sight of the ribbon in accepting it he read
the words for jas cameron written
with a charred stick on the outside
h

adventure

  she sends this by me to cameron
asked martin

  to the man cameron who now is held
at onondaga grunted the oneida

  he had hardly spoken before he was
vanishing into a tangle of bushes martin
gaped blankly for a moment the abrupt
disappearance preventing various queries
he desired to put a soft kiss back of him
brought him to the right-about his hand
on his ax the black bears visage showed
for a moment from beneath some under-
brush and he was pointing behind the
ranger martin lost no time in taking his
cue to efface himself but it required several
minutes to locate the danger a dusky form
slipping from tree to tree farther back
were other forms he had the oneida
to thank for escaping a surprise attack

  securing the roll of bark in his belt he
concentrated all his cunning on escaping
he was convinced there were but a handful
of the enemy else there would have been
a loud outcry and an attempt to encircle
him returning to the gulley he utilized
its cover for a hot sprint when a long
drawn-out yell warned him the iroquois
had discovered where he descended to the
gulley he climbed the bank and struck off
at top speed toward the eastern end of
oneida lake

  he had now penetrated well behind the
mass of warriors surrounding stanwix
and every stride was plunging him deeper
into the iroquois country but given his
liberty until night and he believed the odds
were in his favor for he was on familiar
ground and had various hiding-places it
was growing dusk when he caught the soft
lap-lap of the lake and knew the race was
won at no time during his flight had he
glimpsed black bear of the oneida bear clan

for years a wooden structure
known as the royal blockhouse
stood at this end of the lake it
had withstood many indian assaults but
for more than a decade had been abandoned
by troops and left to the elements the
early morning mists were rising in tenuous
shapes from the lake suggesting quadrilles
by ghosts when martin peered through a
loop-hole and studied the silent woods

  satisfied no enemy was lurking behind
the forest screen he passed the open door
and its silken barrier of spider-webs and
proceeded to the end of the building nearest

the lake here he removed a section of a
log cunningly prepared for such an emer-
gency and passed into the sweet air a
thicket of saplings concealed him as he rose
to his feet and the grove extended to the
shore of the lake stealing to the water
the ranger spread his blanket on the ground
and disrobed to the waist hung a trade
mirror before him and emptied a paint-bag
between his crossed legs

  the brushes of bark he made more pliable
by chewing them next he mixed his
paints and proceeded to transform himself
into an aborigine on his breast he
painted a cayuga totem a bear standing
erect the clan of the bear being common
to the tribes of the long house although
he had utilized his cache of paints in the
blockhouse more than once for turning
himself into a savage it required time and
patience to hack off his long hair and
partially shave his head but when he
had finished jo martin ranger was gone
and dancing black bear cayuga stood
in his place

  now that he was ready for the final test
of his scheme his courage weakened not
that he feared for himself for he would
have gone to the stake if by so doing he
could fully atone for the black thoughts
he had harbored he worried lest the
oneidas intelligence was wrong and that
cameron had been put to death at gaya-
gaanhe the success of his bizarre scheme
demanded that his rival be at onondaga
where the great council-fire ever burned

  so for once his heart grew glad when he
discovered indians approaching from the
direction of stanwix he knew they were
hurrying to onondaga and that only one
errand could call them there-to enjoy the
spectacle of a white man put to the torture
as they moved in a course parallel to his
and as there was no danger of their crossing
his trail he secured a vantage-point and
watched them they were mohawks and
filed by with the precision of a machine
and with no more noise than a snake would
make one warrior carried two scalps
stretched on hoops and the ranger knew
these trophies were furnished by the
soldiers killed a few days before

  throughout the long afternoon and
under the stars of early evening the painted
white man hung to the heels of the mo-
hawks when the glow of fires bloomed
rosily ahead he knew the great adventure
a new keeper of the wampum



was about to be staged for he was on the
outskirts of dread onondaga a loud
chorus of welcome was given the mohawks
and as though the man camerons ordeal
had been postponed till this arrival there
next rose a monotonous chanting

  confident because of his paint and the
obscurity of the night martin glided closer
and gained a position near the great bark
council-house and crouched in some bushes
the council-house stood on a gentle slope
overlooking the place of torture an old
man the hereditary keeper of the wampum
stood in the doorway awaiting the spec-
tacle his slight figure sharply outlined by
the flaming torch in the wall behind him

  groups of warriors were congregating
near the torture-stake and the ring of fire
surrounding but not touching it this
flaming circle contained the calendar of
camerons mortal life for the ranger knew
his rival would be brought forth when the
dancing fire had subsided into beds of coals

  leaving his long rifle in the brush
martin dropped his blanket from his
shoulders and allowed it to hang from his
loins then he struck boldly into the
open the mohawk who carried the
scalps taken at stanwix gave him greeting
which the ranger returned and passed on
the mohawk without suspecting the truth
was impelled to follow him martin dis-
cerned this much and came to a halt as
though waiting to enjoy the preliminaries
every nerve was strung as taut as the cord
of a war bow as he fancied himself in danger
of discovery even before he could fairly
enter upon his project

  he had no time to give to finesse if he
were to make a try for camerons life for
already the flames were shortening and the
ridge of coals climbing higher groups of
the various tribes were steadily growing
larger seneca onondaga cayuga and
mohawk now the groups extended and
came in contact forming a large and com-
pact body wizened hags were coursing
back and forth in a frenzy of blood-lusting
and contributing the only note of im-
patience

  he killed my son at oriskany let me
fondle him let me play with him
shrieked the leader of the witch band

  the cry was caught up and tossed about
with fiendish gusto despite the warmth
of the night martin felt chilly for he had
been with cameron at oriskany

   the warriors held themselves in dignified
restraint although their eyes glittered
brightly as dry fuel was thrown on various
fires to illuminate the scene martin
searched the assemblage closely and was
relieved at not beholding walter butler
tutelary devil to the senecas a warrior
beside the ranger grunted loudly and
smacked his lips in satisfaction

  following the direction of his gaze
martin trembled at beholding the tall
superb figure of cameron advancing through
an aisle of warriors stripped to the buff
his arms fastened behind his back his
blond head was held high but the dew of
death glistened on his forehead that
his eyes narrowed at sight of the stake and
ring of coals discredited his manhood none
two warriors walked beside him holding
him by the arms to prevent his drawing
back with a sudden twist of his massive
shoulders he shunted these aside and with
steady step continued his approach

  ho ho resounded in approval from
many throats

  a man comes to die cried an aged
chief

  ho ho a man comes to die the
fierce shout rolled down the valley and
through the black arches of the forest

  the mohawk with the scalps pressed
forward to obtain a better view of the
entertainment martin edged toward the
council-house again the mohawk felt a
vague misgiving tainting his pleasure and
he took a step after the masquerader
whereat martin gutturally cried

  ho ho we owe the brave man
thanks

  the mohawk halted and resumed watch-
ing the prisoner as a preface to the
more exquisite torture a young brave
seized one of camerons hands and thrust
a finger deep into the bowl of a lighted pipe
with no betrayal of pain the prisoner
stared complacently over the heads of his
captors for a moment then kicked out
behind him and hurled his tormentor into
the coals

  yells of joy greeted the warriors dis-
comfiture as gasping for breath he crawled
from the fiery mass like a scorched snake
martin felt a twinge of the old comradeship
warm his blood and within himself he
muttered-

   fore god hes a brave man

  ho ho a brave man comes to die


adventure

the death of brave men shouted the
savages and axes were held aloft in honor-
able salute to the victim

  martin dropped back and passed through
the outer circle

  he was safe from all eyes except those of
the mohawk the latter could not rid
himself of the feeling that the cayuga was
acting in a peculiar manner in withdrawing
from the delectable spectacle martin
however could not afford to waste another
minute and being in the shadows he ran
swiftly to the rear of the council-house
he knew the mohawk was following him
but did not stay his steps till at the end
of the shed in which the onondagas stored
their winters wood and war supplies for
the league

  why does my brother come here when
a man is about to die challenged the
mohawk placing a heavy hand on martins
shoulder

  with a swing of his ax martin felled him
lifeless and grunted

  right my nosey friend a man has
died

  rolling the body under a bush he entered
the shed and after stumbling over some logs
found what he knew was always stored
there picking up a keg he groped through
the darkness to the door opening into the
council-house throwing this back he sped
down the long passageway till he reached
the edge of the torch-light there he
deposited the keg on the floor the
keeper of the wampum sensed his presence
and turning discovered him

  go out the sachem angrily com-
manded you can not bring rum here
and pointed to the keg has the cayugas
ears grown so thick he never heard that the
wampum of the six nations is kept
here

  martin bowed meekly before the rebuke
and picking up the keg advanced as though
to leave by the front door only on reaching
the door he quickly closed it stupefied
by such behavior the aged guardian blinked
foolishly for a few moments then sought to
cry out a blanket dropped over his head
and smothered him he was dazed by the
time martin finished tying him up the
ranger next knocked the head from the keg
then taking the torch began searching the
various apartments opening off the central
passageway in the third room he entered
he found what he so eagerly desired

sthe night was hideous with the
horrible din of the blood-mad
the screaming hags were fighting
ike demons to get at the prisoner and they
would have spoiled the play prematurely
if not held back by force camerons feet
were hobbled with a small chain then
two warriors protecting themselves against
the heat with robes of green hide dragged
him to the edge of the coals and forced him
to a sitting posture the heat scorched
the bare flesh camerons eyes became
distended and his tongue worked des-
perately to find moisture in his dry
mouth

  this slow baking process continued for
some minutes was so cunningly regulated
as to do the victim no serious harm albeit
inflicting exquisite pain at last one of the
torturers as though moved by compassion
held out a small kettle of water while the
other yanked cameron to his feet cam-
eron greedily lunged his head forward to
secure a mouthful the warrior snatched
it back drank heartily and poured what
remained on to the ground this bit of
play a mere preliminary to the real and
lasting agony was greeted with prolonged
howls of approval cameron bit his hps
and braced his shoulders

  ho ho roared the onlookers

  again the prisoner was forced close to
the coals this time so near that his flesh
began to shrivel then he was drawn
back a pace and another brave offered
him water cameron ignored the kettle
until it was pressed almost against his
lips when his suffering drove him to try
once more this time he was permitted
to bury his mouth in the fluid only to jerk
back his head with a groan of pain it was
scalding hot

  ho ho the white man does not like
the drink of the iroquois exulted the
warrior

  a crescendo of fiendish approval lasted
for nearly a minute and was only stilled
when the deep voice of the master of
ceremonies called for silence this was
the signal for the torture to begin in
earnest two braves seized the victim
and made a chain fast about his waist and
prepared to hurl him inside the glowing
circle the stake a large sapling trimmed
of its branches was sizzling as the heat dried
up the oozing sap

  the savage spectators glared expectantly
a new keeper of the wampum



even the brood of hags ceased their clamor
now was come the real test between the
prisoners defiant bearing and the resources
of the iroquois it was to be a duel such
as the indians ever loved to witness
shrinking flesh and raw nerves against all
the devices for inflicting physical suffering
the diabolism of the long house could put
in practise

  when the chain was firmly fastened
about camerons waist the warriors bent
their knees and made ready to hurl him
inside the fatal ring from the opposite
side a brave drew a long breath and leaped
the hurdle of coals to catch the slack of
the chain and make it secure about the
stake but something shot over the vic-
tims head and twined like a snake about
the neck of the brave

  with a yelp of astonishment the young
brave tore the thing loose and leaped from
the circle as he held it above his head
the spectators glared incredulously the
warriors holding cameron released him to
gape in amazement and he worked back
from the fierce heat unrebuked a new
and unthinkable climax had been thrust
into the scene

  what so miraculously dropped from the
velvet heavens was a wampum belt and
at that one the iroquois recognized as a
cherished possession of the federated tribes
it was seven rows of beads wide and several
hundred beads long it contained the
figure of a man at one end and a cross at
the other both in white against a dark
ground and connected by a single row of
white beads there was none who did not
identify it as a french belt the markings
recording the great distance the envoy
traveled in order to present his talk to
the long house

  but the reasons for the envoys coming
as talked by him into the wampum was
known only to the hereditary keeper of
the wampum it was in wampum that
the six nations recorded their speeches
treaties laws tribal and intertribal history
it was the last step before hieroglyphics
and perhaps on a par with and yet more
subtle than picture-writing the pattern
of the beads associated the sign or object
with some historical fact or epochal idea
therefore the office of the hereditary keeper
was semi-sacred and its inviolability was
to be maintained at all costs

  while each savage mind was struggling

to find an explanation for the belt flying
through the night there rang out a mocking
voice up the slope the words falling like the
crack of a whip

  ho ho a white man comes to trade
it proclaimed

  with an inarticulate primitive cry of rage
the iroquois emerged from their stupor

  ho ho continued the mocking voice
who trades for kanasa wampum who
will give white flesh for white and black
and purple wampum six strings is the
price of a life the white man offers seven
strings

  the stake and its victim were forgotten
as the indians fixed their astounded gaze
on the figure of martin standing in the
brightly illumined doorway of the council
if not for his confession that his flesh was
white they would have accepted him for
a cayuga with the totem of a dancing bear
showing on his oily chest

  ho who trades for onondaga belts
who trades for the records of the long
house

  with a terrific yell the savages sprang
forward in a mass now realizing a stranger
stood in the place of the keeper of the
sacred wampum but before they could
swarm up the slope and wipe out the
profanation martin pulled the keg into
view and held his pistol to it loudly
warning

  keep back ye dogs keep far back
or i blow up this council-house and your
wampum this is gunpowder

  as he spoke his left hand piled the
precious records about the keg

  the onrush halted abruptly having
impressed upon the iroquois the need of
prudence martin resumed his taunts and
boisterously called out

  i see six strings of purple beads bound
together-the six nations and he held
up the cluster of strings symbolic of the
long house here are seven of purple
and a handful of white-the voice of the
onondagas and strings that speak for
the cayugas the mohawks and the senecas
who has a white man called cameron to
trade for strings and belts of wampum

  a tall savage wearing the insignia of the
hereditary chiefship of the onondaga bear
clan lifted his right hand palm outward
and slowly advanced beyond his fellows to
act as spokesman as befitted him who
headed the roll of the federal chiefs


adventure

  what does the white man do here
painted like a cayuga he demanded

  he comes to trade with wathatotarho
answered martin giving him his official
name and title

  what has he to trade

  belts of the onondaga of every tribe
in the six nations the records of the long
house for good measure he will throw
in the hereditary keeper of the wampum
as he spoke martin reached aside and
dragged a kicking bundle into view

  wathatotarho faced the warriors and
solemnly announced

  he has been touched by the great
spirit he shall go in peace

  ho he shall go in peace was the
rumbling response

  the great spirit sent the white man
here in an indian skin to trade with the
iroquois calmly corrected the ranger
he must remain till he has made a bargain
many moons ago the french talked with
you with thirty-six belts the greatest
wampum talk ever held till now behold
i talk to you with more than a hundred
belts i talk with this one sent to the
long house long ago by the wagunhas
ottawa i talk with this one black with
rows of white between with the white
council-fire in the middle and the white
road leading to johnson hall-sir william
johnsons friendship belt given when he
first met the iroquois

  there rose dolorous howls from the
mohawks who still mourned the dead
superintendent martin held up another
ragged at the ends obviously an ancient
belt and said

  or i talk with this a peace belt sent the
onondaga by the cherokee nation who
wants to buy i give kanasa for a white
man called cameron

  the white man has gunpowder in the
keg from wathatotarho

  for an answer martin selected a small
belt such as the senecas used in the white
dog sacrifice and dipped it in a gourd of
water and then sprinkled it liberally with
the powder wadding it into a ball he
suddenly hurled it toward the fire with
cries of dismay a dozen hands stretched out
to catch the consecrated object but failed
and the belt fell at the edge of the coals
instantly there came a surish and a bright
flash that removed all doubt as to the nature
of the black sand

  back of this council-house is a dead
mohawk dog take that belt in payment
cried martin

  the savages stared aghast mutterings
of ferocious rage rippled through the dark
ranks and several braves at the ends of the
lines detached themselves and slipped into
the undergrowth martin pulled the keg
and belts back from the door and warned
listen ye iroquois to my last words
the man cameron is to be set free now
or i blow myself and this council-house and
these belts into the sky call back your
young men who foolishly think to take me
by surprise your answer shall i fire
and he tightened his grip on the pistol

  wathatotarho threw up both hands in a
gesture of surrender

  the man cameron shall go with you
take him and leave us our wampum
with an exclamation of joy cameron
advanced up the slope with no hand at-
tempting to stay his steps but he became
bewildered when the ranger sharply ordered
him to halt

  its one of their tricks jim cameron
fiercely explained martin stay where
you are till they bring your clothes they
must take you to fort stanwix on
arriving send back a written word that i
may know you are safe

  jo martin old jo choked the big
fellow rubbing his eyes

  dancing black bear of the cayugas
corrected martin frigidly heres some-
thing i was to give you take it and

be-

  then to wathatotarho

  let your braves take the prisoner to
stanwix and guard him from harm he
will send a talking paper to me then
and not till then you shall have back your
belts and your wampum-keeper

  with that he closed the door and made
it fast

the white man has his talking
paper why does he not leave us
in peace demanded wathatotarho
outside the closed door

  martin reread the scrawl which had been
shoved under the door he knew it was
genuine for cameron had written

we fought side by side at oriskany and on the
river trail to cottons

                     jim cameron

                             ft stanwix
a new keeper of the wampum



  striking his ax against the door the
ranger ordered-

  stand far away wathatotarho

  the chief retired to the long line of
warriors it was night and several fires
brought the long lines into half-relief and
martin knew the lines completely encircled
the council-house as he heard the chief
retreat the ranger stooped over the sachem
and pressed the point of his knife to the
mans throat and removing the gag
hissed

  say again the words hes in the shed
but say them softly

  the sachem groaned in a paroxysm of-
rage limbered up his jaws and did as told
martin clapped back the gag and tested
his imitation of the sachems voice there
was a peculiar shrill crackling note that
was hard to get but he believed he had it
already he had adorned himself with the
sachems necklace of beads and other
insignia and by means of the paint-bag
had counterfeited the sachems facial deco-
rations he also had further thinned his
hair by a spartan use of the knife and was
now ready to trust his luck to the night

  placing a kettle of water beside the
powder and throwing the sachems painted
skin cloak over his shoulders he sagged
his shoulders and bent his back in a sem-
blance of old age then he drew a deep
breath and threw back the door violently

  wathatotarho and his warriors surged
forward as the door flew open then remem-
bered the keg and fell back but instead
of the intruders erect figure they beheld
the bowed form of the hereditary keeper
of the wampum and even as they gazed
and wondered how he became free he seized
the kettle of water and dashed it over the
powder and in a shrill voice screeched
hes in the shed the powder is wet
and with one frightened glance over his
shoulder he scuttled down the slope toward
the savages

	an attack yelled a sentinel
as a splutter of rifle-shots aroused
the woods before fort stanwix
dont shoot yelled cameron knock-
ing up the rifle as a painted savage reeled
into the opening with a war arrow flapping
from his left shoulder its jo martin
come on fellers

  and he dropped over the stockade with
several scouts at his heels

  martin streaked with blood and sweat
and dirt hobbled  toward them out of
the forest burst three iroquois a mohawk
an onandaga and a seneca each striving
to count a coup by securing the mad white
mans scalp they were at martins heels
while cameron and his followers were
several hundred yards distant martin
realized he must do his own fighting for a
bit longer he wheeled and holding the
long rifle with one hand shot the onondaga
who went down with a gush of blood
stifling his death-cry

  dropping the rifle and summoning all
his strength the ranger plucked the ax
from his belt and spun it in a glittering
circle full into the face of the seneca who
dropped with no semblance of features left
the mohawk hurled his ax and missed and
turned to flee but tripped and sprawled
headlong as he regained his feet cameron
caught him by the neck and thus holding
him swung him clear of the ground and
about his head and hurled him with
sickening force against a stump

  they carried martin more dead than
alive inside the fort and placed him on a
pallet his shoulders and chest bore testi-
mony to the fight he had made in winning
through to stanwix as they washed
and dressed his wounds he opened his eyes
and scowled feebly on beholding cameron

  dont say it jo huskily begged
cameron the birchbark she sent me
listen it says i love the man who
fetched you back betty sent it she
wouldnt give me an answer the day i went
to help you hold em back on the river trail
but it was you-you all the time

  there was a flutter of skirts through the
open door and cameron was pushed aside
that betty herself might kneel by the
ranger and lay her cheek against his hid-
eously painted face

  always you jo she sobbed but
you angered me by trying to dictate a
maids a maid but once-and shouldnt be
hurried then you said youd force me
to marry you-and never made love to
me-or gave me a chance

  cameron reached over the girls shoulder
and seized the rangers right hand saying

  you saved me from the stake jo
yoqve got the girl i wanted i owe you a
life jo its yours at the call good luck
and good fortune-im off for mich-

tine signal from the woods

milly went up to the roof and
loosed the flag the pole had with-
stood the storm bravely he re-
ported that he could see nothing
of the germans but this was not strange
the binocular could sweep the distant
reaches of the santa marta road but close
at hand the trees prevented a view of the
ravine on either side to the west the hill
dropped away forbiddingly to the lower
lands to the east was the gentle slope of
the old coffee field farther east where
the footbridge was to be found according
to diego a stretch of the primeval forest
intervened and to the south the forest
again blocked the view

  they lunched and afterward the four
of them gathered in the living-room to
discuss the situation they had decided
that it was unnecessary to keep a watch
at kaufmans door he could not break
it down without making a commotion that
would raise the dead and his barred windows
guarded against escape in that direction

  the rain was over sam was patrolling
the grounds with a loaded mauser tia
matilde was bringing into the dining-room
pantry the supplies she had cooked tio
diego had gone to his hut on the edge of
the woods on some errand of his own
winifred threw open the shutters of the
living-room

  we can close them at a moments
notice she said it is like a tomb in
here with only these peepholes to let the
light in

  jimmy had broached the cigars brought
from cortina they were mild and brewer
who smoked only occasionally was drawing
on one with what small relish the hour
permitted he was standing at a front
window looking out billy sprawled in
inelegant comfort in an easy chair re-
marked sagely-

  what we ought to have done was to-
hustle out and chop that bridge down
brewer glanced around at him

  it would only have delayed them billy
they would have gone back to the ford
and waited until they could get across
it seems to me that if they had known
about the bridge they would be here by
now advanced winifred they have
had time for it

  brewer made a motion of assent

  yes and there is another thing i
may have been wrong in my conclusions
the men i saw might very well have been
on their way to santa marta not here
i can give no reason for thinking they were
germans i simply had a feeling that they
were

  he deprecated this feeble logic with a
meager smile

  if i could get over to the other side of
the ravine id soon find out if there were
any germans there observed jimmy

  he brushed the ash from his cigar scowl-


for the flag



ing and grimacing thoughtfully

  yes and get nabbed by them billy
scoffed

  oh maybe not id try it higher up
and work down to them through the woods

  billy grunted his disfavor of the plan

  come again father diego says it will
be night before any one can cross that
was some sprinkle we had if it was short
and if its a boat you are thinking of there
isnt any i asked diego

  i might swim it

  ever try swimming in a mill race
you dont know what a babbling little
brook can be in this country after a cloud-
burst and if you could do it theyd pot
you before you were half over a neat way
to rob the perry millions of an heir gee
whiz

  brewer slewed around abruptly to the
window jimmy spoke up quickly

  you are a cheerful hand to have about
dear child a real inspiration in a time of
trouble im glad i brought you along

  he managed a careless laugh and with it
covertly a black look at billy the boy
stared at him what had he said to bring
this glowering visitation on himself he
was on the point of injuredly demanding
an explanation when an interruption turned
the thoughts of all into other channels
sam appeared at the window where brewer
was standing he had come around the
house from the west side his manner
was mysterious

  i aint let him see ise a-pryin on him
but pears like mister coughem he carryin
on wif somebuddy over yander he
jerked a gargantuan thumb in the direc-
tion of the woods that ran along the
southern edge of the coffee field hes
done trowed open de shutters an hes
floutin er rag out de winder taint jes
to muse himsef i low yit i kaint make
out nobuddy over dar

  they were all crowded around the window
now

  it was the germans you saw father
exclaimed winifred they found the
bridge

  i wish i could know how many there
are mused brewer they wont try to
parley with us after the reception we gave
them on their first visit

  i am going up on the roof perhaps
i can see them jimmy said he sigaed to
billy to follow him

  they may shoot you cried winifred
dont go up

  i wont show myself more than i can
help he assured her i doubt if they
carry anything but pistols and its a far
shot from the woods

  the field-glass was in the chair where
billy had dropped it when he came down
from his survey before lunch jimmy
seized it he was about to mount the
ladder with billy to support it when it
occurred to him that he would better have
a peep at kaufman first he tiptoed to his
door and pushed the slide back gently

  if the imperial envoy had been signaling
to any one he was not at this moment so
engaged he was at his southeast window
stock still and muttering to himself
slowly with curious silences intervening
as he watched jimmy saw kaufman nod
to himself and raise his hand there was
a towel in it he reached his arm through
the bars and went through a sequence of
motions-up and down and from side to
side in it appeared some sort of pre-
established order

  jimmy closed the slide and returned to
billy he told him what he had seen

  wig-wagging the boy exclaimed
theres army training for you i bet it is
neiderlein talking to him we ought to
stop it jimmy kaufman is telling him
what to do

  let brewer know jimmy bade him
i can manage to get up here i reckon
without a fall

  billy ran off jimmy climbed the ladder
he lifted a wing of the skylight until he
could push his head through the opening
the ladder wobbled crazily under him
and he clutched at the skylight casing to
save himself then of a sudden he found
his footing firmer the ladder was being
steadied from below

  i am holding it said a voice it was
winifred

  jimmy looked down at her

  thank you he returned i was
making a mess of it billy told you about
kaufman

  yes he and father are planning some-
thing do be careful up there dont
let them see you

  i dont think they can i wont keep
you long

  he rested his elbows on the coaming and
conned the coffee field and the adjoining


adventure

wood with the binocular if kaufman
had ceased his signaling there would in all
likelihood be a response unless-and this
was possible-the ministers message was
final in such case no one would show him-
self in the open jimmy decided

  do you see any one winifred called
up to him

  he lowered the glass as he replied

  not a soul theyve done talking for
the time anyway i think ill come down
ha wait a minute

  he had put the glass to his eyes for a last
look something moved in the field of
vision-an animal of sofne kind he thought
at first skulking in the brush at the verge
of the woods it was moving away from
the trees in a line that would take it along
the bottom of the hill and in the direction
of the ravine jimmy revised his initial
impression

  thats no four-footed beast he mur-
mured

a small clear space amid the
bushes lay in the path of the
prowler jimmy centered his gaze
on it the thing came to it and darted
across it was a man bent double and
running he was immediately swallowed
up in the farther bushes one of the
germans of course any one on a peace-
able errand would not act in this way

  jimmy turned his glass to the woods
if there were others following he wanted
to know how many but nothing stirred
he swept the coffee field again there was
no movement in it the man was lost to
view

  the sound of hammering jarred the still-
ness it startled jimmy he drew his
head in from the skylight and questioned
winifred she was holding the ladder with
rigid arms bracing it against his sudden
shift of balance

  what is it-that noise he asked

  father and billy are nailing herr kauf-
mans shutters up a board on the out-
side

  jimmy grinned

  incommunicado fine he started
down well i saw the chap he was
running toward the ravine there are no
others or at any rate they didnt show
themselves he stood beside her now
on the floor thank you for your help

  she waved it aside

  if we are to succeed each must help
where he can why was the man running
to the ravine can you guess what
could he want there if they came over on
the bridge they cant bring the caracross
it is what id like to know rejoined
jimmy it couldnt be that only one
of them tried the bridge and yet if all
came why is that fellow heading for the
river

  the hammering started up again and
from kaufmans room proceeded harsh cries
of expostulation

  there are three windows commented
winifred they are at the second
jimmy was thinking of that skulking
figure in the bushes

   im going to see what hes up to he
announced no not herr kaufman i
can hear what hes up to he laughed i
mean that other hun i am going down
to the river

   he ran into the living-room and picked
up his revolver from the table winifred
followed him to the door

   do you think it wise she asked her
eyes were troubled because you saw only
one man it doesnt indicate that he is alone
the others may be waiting for him you
may fall into a trap

  but he argued we decided didnt
we that if they had come by the bridge
there would be nothing to call them to the
ravine-not while the water is high

   i dont know what to say she answered
with an anxious frown only it seems to
me that you are running a risk with no
advantage to be gained it seems to me
that our part is to wait for what may
happen we are on the defensive

   yes but if i can find out what is doing
down there we shall be doubly armed to
know what the other fellow is going to do
before he does it is some advantage isnt
it he smiled at her whimsically ill
keep both eyes open one in front and one
 behind he wont catch me asleep that
chap

she said nothing she saw that he was
bent on going and she stepped aside from
the door he paused and held out his hand
will you wish me luck winifred

   it was the second time that he had called
her by her given name yet she showed
no resentment she accepted it as a con-
dition of the strange intimacy in which
events had placed them
for the flag



  i shall watch for you to come back
she said simply and let her hand rest
briefly in his

  he had left the house and was crossing
to the fringe of trees on the brow of the hill
when he heard her call to him-

  mr perry

  he turned she sat at a window of the
living-room she had drawn to one of
the shutters and had paused with the other
half-closed

  if you have trouble fire a shot she
finished

  he returned a step or two

  that was clear he said but the
first part-please repeat it

  the first part she did not under-
stand

  yes the name mr smith is billy
to his friends i claim a similar recognition
from mine i am jimmy to those i
care for

  he had come back still other steps as he
spoke he was ten yards from her she
regarded him with a detached air as might
one who is asked to solve a complex problem
suddenly presented in the stress of the
time that was upon them he had stopped
for this-a token of an assured friendship
that could never be how should she
answer him the solution was as old as
mother eve she said speaking gravely
and distinctly-

  if you get into trouble jimmy fire a
shot to let us know

  the shutter closed jimmy started anew
on his quest a smile was on his lips but
not of triumph it went deeper than
that

chapter xxvi

what diego found

kaufman in a supreme access of rage
had emptied his water pitcher on
brewer and billy as they were nailing up
the last of the three windows and he had
applied epithets to them in his own tongue
that billy in common decency had refrained
from interpreting to brewer the latter
however sensed the reason for his silence
he said

  i am going in to speak to this fellow
billy come with me

  kaufman greeted them with a rabid look
he burst out at billy in a flood of german

brewer interfered his eyes narrowing on

the man

you can speak english-do it he

snapped

  kaufman paid no regard to him he
continued his animadversions to billy who
in a way of his own brought to pass what
brewer had failed to do he compelled
the german to employ his english in self-
defense

  he says billy reported to brewer with
nice enunciation that his eyes are not
strong and he appreciates the darkening
of the room for him

  that is not so it is a lie bellowed
the diplomat he shook a furious finger
at the recreant youth you are a ger-
man and you are faithless to your blood-
a miserable renegade

  hold up there billys chin protruded
belligerently im not a german not
any more than roosevelt is a dutchman
get me straight im an american born
bred and brought up under the flag that
floats above this house-the stars and
stripes of america

   der teufel hole amerikal shrieked the
other

  and continued billy unmindful of
the objurgation what german blood is in
me is clean-straight from the honest soil-
and im proud of it but for the murdering
kaiser who has made the german name a
stink in the world i say-to hell with him
and all his brood

  the imperial envoy staggered under this
blasphemy he strove to speak but only
swallowed horribly brewer spoke instead

  i wish to inform you kaufman that
there will be no more wig-wagging from this
house if you put a hand out of one of
these windows the negro sam will chop
it off

  this definite way of stating the alterna-
tive made its impress on the minister it
brought him down to the realities of his
plight he had been quick to see that
through the shutter peepholes he could
still signal to his people but now the
image of the black goliath rose before him
and chilled his blood

  i think thats all brewer added

  he looked at billy and they moved to
the door kaufman called to them
explosively

a moment i have friends at hand
you will save yourselves from harm if you


adventure

stop where you are in this outrage re-
store me to liberty and my friends will go
away you have my official word for it
brewer contemplated him with a
strangely interested air

  your official word you say

  jal

  a promise in the kaisers name

 ja ja

  brewer swung to his heel and drew open
the door

  come he said to billy he offers
us only brass

  with the roar of a maddened bull kauf-
man hurled himself at them billy was
standing back of brewer in the room he
jumped aside and stuck out a foot the
representative of imperial germany came
down in a most democratic sprawl he
was not hurt they saw he was only wofully
stripped of his bravado and breath

  billy grinned at brewer

  shall we go now he suggested

for answer brewer motioned him out
and bolted the door winifred came run-
ning from her room to meet them she
had heard the crash of kaufmans fall
what was it-she inquired anxiously
an overturned chair brewer told her
she knew it was an evasion to quiet her
alarm and it pleased her she did not
press the question and they went together
to the living-room

  where is jimmy billy queried not
on the roof all this time

  she recounted what had taken place

  i told sam to let us know if he heard a
shot she ended

  brewer looked grave

  i dont like it he said it was a
foolish thing to do

  billy who could entertain the adventure
in an alluring light did not agree with him
but he would not contradict him openly

  it wouldnt be a bad thing to know
how many weve got to handle he ad-
vanced what i cant make out is why
the dickens they dont come at us theres
nothing to prevent whats holding them
off maybe jimmy can tell us when he
gets back

  some one knocked at the shutters of the
east window winifred had closed them
all when jimmy left brewer crossed to
the window and reconnoitered the outside
it was sam and with him was tio diego
brewer threw open the shutters

  sam pointed to the peasant

  deres somethin he got on his min
boss an i kaint make head er tail on it
if deyd only speak sos people could
unerstan wat deys aimin at itd save er
heap er trubbel

diego shrugged hopelessly he
knew that brewers spanish was a
thing of verbal shreds and tatters
and his daughters was but little better
but-as billy appeared-here was a chris-
tian who could speak the language of the
blessed saints if not with the entire ex-
cellence of one born and cradled in it
he erupted into a passionate recital in
which shoulders hands and every facial
muscle took a part billy stopped him from
time to time to translate to the others in
substance diegos story was this

  he had gone to his hut for tobacco to
make cigarets he got to thinking of the
old footbridge at the south end of the
ravine it seemed that what he had said
about it to the americans was considered
important he decided to go and see if it
was still there

  he followed an old little-known trail
for it was the short way to the bridge it
led across the santa marta road and then
again into the forest until it brought up
at the ravine one could of course follow
the stream from the ford but that was the
long way around and the more difficult

  well when finally he came out on the
river there was no bridge it had gone
there was some wreckage of it on the bank
where it had torn away from its anchorage
but the bridge itself was not there he ex-
amined the wreckage and the fractures were
fresh he looked about him there were
scrambling muddy marks on the rocks-
quite fresh-and back a little were foot-
prints in the soft earth a mans-one
only-one single man

  it was easy now to tell what had hap-
pened the bridge was old it was weak
it was rotten and the storm had shaken
it the man started over on it he was half-
way when it began to give it was as safe
to advance as to retreat he went on and
by the grace of his patron saint reached the
bank and threw himself down on it as the
bridge broke and fell

  that was all diego had followed the
footprints a few rods the man was going
north along the river diego had turned
for the flag



back and hurried home to tell what he had
seen

  billy took from his pocket one of the
silver dollars he had extracted from the
reluctant whittaker and handed it to
diego he commended him for what he
had done and bade him stay close to the
house for the rest of the day they might
have need of him

  well we have learned that there is
only one man on this side said winifred
the others must have gone back to the
ford on the opposite side as they came

   a little sigh of relief of which she herself
was unaware escaped her

  i wonder if it was neiderlein who got
across speculated billy it was a
leaders job and he is the legation head
in the absence of kaufman huh jimmy
can take care of him all right

  he helped himself to a cigar from the box
on the table and sat down brewer was
pacing the room meditatively winifred
remained by the window looking out sam
had resumed his patrol of the grounds
brewer halted abruptly

  you say winny that perry was to fire
a shot if he met with trouble

  yes he promised to

  what was his plan he must have
had one

  i dont know father he said he was
going to find out what the man was up to
i did not ask him how he hoped to do it
her eyes went to the watch on her wrist
he has been gone thirty-two minutes
this scrupulous exactitude brought an
odd glance from her father even billy
turned his head and regarded her inquisi-
tively but she was not conscious of the
scrutiny her gaze was on the out-of-doors
again her attitude alert and tense brewer
glanced at her a second time and took up
his walk about the room the minutes
dragged by billy put his cigar aside and
stirred uneasily in his chair

  confound it he rapped out this is
getting on my nerves its like waiting for
dinner when youve got to catch a train
hes gone an hour hasnt he miss wini-
fred

  yes her voice was sharp and short
i could crawl to the river and back in
that time grumbled billy

  he got up and began handling the
mausers stacked in a comer going over
them to see if all were loaded though he

knew well that they were having seen to it
himself with jimmy but he was restless
he wanted action any demand on him but
the grinding requirement of passive expec-
tancy

  the difficulty is said brewer out of the
silence he had been wrapped in that if he
fires a shot it will be hard to locate it
accurately sound is deceptive

  im betting he dont have to fire
billy argued jimmy can take care of
himself hell be back all smiling its
just this darned waiting that hurts
winifred left the window she walked
mutely past the two to the door brewers
eyes followed her

  where are you going winny he
inquired

  to my room i am tired she said
without looking at him and went out

  brewers gaze remained fastened on the
empty doorway his expression was som-
ber billy abandoned the guns and spoke
to him he turned with a quick intake of
his breath

  now that she is gone what do you
think of it sir billy asked that bunch
could have knocked together some sort of
a raft you know and come across its
not impossible and jimmy may have
stumbled right into them without being able
to fire his gun

  i was thinking of that brewer admitted
and billy if its so what can we do
ive been thinking of that also they will
be coming here they are five at least
perhaps six-the car was filled with men-
and if either of us go it will leave only two
to hold the house we cant count on
diego he has no real interest in us and
winifred-she is brave but after all a
woman if they should break in-well
they are germans

  no no we cant take that chance
cried the boy jimmy would be the first
to damn us if we did we-we will just
have to wait mr brewer weve got to
do it

  they tried to settle down to it quietly
but the task was too hard for them brewer
rose from his chair and began pacing the
floor again then billy bounced to his feet

im going to the roof maybe ill see
something anything is better than this
brewer steadied the ladder for him
billy did not stop on the last rung he drew
himself up to the tiles and stood there


adventure

scanning the country with the binocular
brewer stepped to winifreds door he
knocked but there was no response he
opened it and looked in she was lying
on the bed her face in the pillows

  winny he called softly

  she did not answer he would not have
approached her in this way she knew if
he had news to tell he lingered a moment
voiceless then closed the door and came
away

  brewer waited by the ladder for billy
his face was contorted with pain the pain
that bites deeper than any bodily ill he
was roused by billys foot on the ladder

  could you see anything of them he
questioned wearily

  billy shook his head

 not a sign when he was down he
said brokenly mr brewer it-its getting
to be more than i can stand they have
got jimmy-i know it-and we cant do a
thing

  the boy dropped on a chair and covered
his brimming eyes with his hands

chapter xxvii

in the enemys hands

there were two courses jimmy could
pursue in his hunt for the man he had
seen from the housetop one was to pro-
ceed openly down the drive on the east side
of the hill to the santa marta road and
follow it leisurely to the ravine as though he
were merely curious to see the stage of the
water and was without suspicion of enemy
proximity

  the other was to go down the north side
of the hill and through the scrub to the
river from there he could work east along
the bank the boldness of the first ap-
pealed to him but as he thought on it he
realized that the man he sought would not
be likely to show himself if he saw any one
approaching on the public highway either
that or if there were others with him he
might be ambushed and taken prisoner
he decided on the second course

  it was slow going down the rocky hill
and in the thorny scrub and it was hor-
ribly hot but he won through and found
himself in the dense thickets on the ravine
brink the water he noted was falling
rapidly though it was still a boiling flood

  he laughed at the thought he had enter-

tained of swimming it he had never ac-
quired distinction in the art and this
demanded skill as well as strength he
worked his way heedfully in the direction
of the santa marta road and came out
finally on a little jut of clear ground just
above the pitch of the road to the ford it
was screened from the river by a growth
of ironwood bushes and twining sarsaparilla
but on the road side there was nothing that
offered stand-up concealment

  jimmy threw himself flat and crawled
toward the brim some one directly below
was calling across the stream answering
voices came and the language was german
jimmy wanted to find out how many men
were on this side and how many on the
other by worming carefully to the verge
of the tiny precipice he could see around
the screen of bushes he thought and could
look down also on the road

  a luxuriant flowering plant that he did
not know swayed outward from the verge
its large glossy leaves raised tier on tier
would afford him protection he crept
toward it gained it-and clutched at it
wildly the overshot edge of ground weak-
ened by the rain was giving way jimmy
tried to save himself by a backward flop
but the leverage was gone he came down
to the road sliding on his shoulder head-
foremost in a porridge of mud

  the devil he spurted out in angry
dismay and repeated it-the devil take
it

  a shout rose from the opposite bank a
voice near at hand spoke in hard english

  so you could not wait for us to come
well we have one less to deal with do
not move

  it was sub-lieutenant karl hecht of
arraca and he was alone none of his men
was on this side a cold smile played on
his blond features and in his hand as he
explored jimmys pockets was an unpleasant
instrument pf swift destruction that he
would shoot if resistance was offered jimmy
perfectly understood

  you win the first round he said
its in my right-hand pocket what you are
looking for

  the exploring fingers came away not
only with his revolver but with his card-
case and the letters that were in his breast
pocket

  get up ordered his captor step off
to the right to that tree over there
for the flag



  jimmy obeyed hecht followed him
closely they plunged through a serried
growth of brush off the road and came to
the tree the spot commanded a view of
the ford and the germans on the other side
there were four of them they were watch-
ing him jimmy could see but they did not
cry out any more this man evidently was
their leader was he neiderlein

  hecht pointed to a flat stone in the outer
shade of the tree

  sit down he directed for himself he
selected the base of the tree with the trunk
for a back they were well-curtained from
the road hecht was guarding against a
chance interference he looked into the
card-case fingered the banknotes it con-
tained and tossed it over to jimmy the
other matter he examined with care they
were letters from home and the two cable-
grams from perry sr he read them all
with sedulous attention lifting a wary
eye frequently to his vis-a-vis

  jimmy could make no protest at this
scrutiny of his intimate affairs he re-
flected grimly that he was a prisoner of
war in precisely the situation that he him-
self had placed the imperial german minis-
ter he had it was true refrained from
going through kaufmans pockets but it
was a weak obedience to scruples that war-
fare took no account of he could claim no
indulgence for it

  another thought came to jimmy he
was more than a prisoner of war-he was a
spy and spies were dealt with summarily
in a state of war here was a small off-
shoot of the great conflict in which his
country was involved and it was he who
had promoted it by the rules of the game
he could expect no leniency from his foe

  he secretly surveyed the man by the
tree he was of his own build and wiry
and hard as nails without the gun laid
handily at his side he would be a tough
customer to tackle though this to jimmy
would have been no deterrent even odds
was all he asked if only that gun   

  hecht spoke to him he had finished
his perusal of the letters they contained
nothing of moment to him but he decided
to keep them he flipped one of the cable-
grams with his finger before stowing it away

  too slow-eh perry-going home to
enlist you did it here

  i am of an impatient nature jimmy
answered placidly he did not intend to

let this hun rag him whatever came
you have the advantage of me he con-
tinued do you prefer to have me address
you as x or as a definite quantity

  the german considered the request
the humor of it passed him by he saw only
the practical side

  lieutenant hecht of the imperial re-
serves he replied bruskly

  jimmy raised his brows

  oh i had thought you were that fellow
neiderlein you got across on the bridge of
course why didnt your men come with
you

  it broke i made it just in time

  that was a pity commented jimmy
he went on leaving the other to take the
remark as he would-if i am not too in-
quisitive lieutenant hecht i would like
further information-now that youve got
me what are you going to do with me

hecht did not answer his
attention was directed to the men
across the river one of them was
down at the waters edge looking out over
the current he turned to his companions
and made an affirmative sign

  if hes thinking of swimming it
jimmy said conversationally to hecht
hed better go up a way hed have a
chance of landing here then

  the lieutenant regarded him with a glim-
mer of interest this american was not
readily disturbed it appeared

  you are the one who carried off his
excellency last night he accused suddenly

  am i thank you for acquainting me
with it jimmy bowed to him

  why did you do it demanded hecht

  oh just for a joke rejoined jimmy
carelessly

  the germans look grew black

  you wished to know what im going to
do with you he spat out one of two
things-exchange you for his excellency or
shoot you

  jimmy felt the blood crowd back on his
heart for he was convinced that the threat
was not an idle one hecht meant it but
to surrender kaufman to save his own
skin was a thing he would not do and
curiously in a lightning flash there was
limned in his mind the thin stooped form of
brewer the expatriate his hand lifted to the
flag his voice challenging as he cried out-
let them come and haul it down


adventure

  jimmy smiled palely as he replied to the
teuton

  i do not find either proposition agree-
able mr lieutenant

  it will be one or the other hecht
asserted

 that returned jimmy evenly is
your affair i am done with it

  it is for your friends to say jeered
hecht i shall submit it to them with the
assurance that if they do not accede i will
execute you in plain view of them after-
ward we will take his excellency anyway
not alive i will bet with you on that
and make it ten to one in your favor

  hecht stared at him grunted something
in his own tongue and lapsed into silence
jimmy had stuffed some cigars in his pocket
before leaving the house they were broken
badly but he found one that was yet
smokable lit it and with his hands clasped
easily about his knee puffed away with as-
sumed indifference to his fate

  though the day was well advanced-it
was four oclock-the heat was growing
instead of diminishing with the declining
sun it was a still dry suffocating heat
settling down like a vast blanket over the
earth to jimmy it seemed as if there was
a portent of evil in it though this perhaps
could be attributed to his mental state

  his gaze wandered to the opposite rim of
the ravine no one of the germans was in
sight his gaze came back to hecht he
was still staring at him now he asked
so you took me for herr neiderlein
do you not know him

  i am happy to say that i do not
then why did you take me for him
we rather looked for him thats all
we thought his man landeker who came
this morning had given him such a glowing
report of our hospitality that neiderlein
would want a taste of it himself i suppose
it was landeker who posted you on the lay
of the land out here or- jimmy ventured
a random shot-was it my esteemed
friend and proclaimed countrywoman miss
mary taylor

  jimmy fancied he saw a change in the
stolid face of the man but if hecht intended
a reply it was cut off by a hail from the
river the germans were swimming down
one of them in fact was landing at a spot
below the tree hecht stood up he
flipped the sweat from his forehead with a
curse at the heat

  you sit still or the birds will pick your
bones on that rock he growled at jimmy

  the first german came up steaming from
the river for the enveloping heat had al-
ready seized on him in five minutes he
would be dry as tinder pistol cartridge
belt and all hecht uttered a command
and the man went off into the brush the
others came up one by one big burly
customers hecht put a question to them
and after a general searching of pockets one
produced a length of whipcord the first
man returned he held in his hand a
smooth straight freshly cut stick about
two feet long and an inch thick hecht
addressed the group briefly from an
occasional gesture in the direction of the
hacienda jimmy judged that he was out-
lining a plan of assault

 hecht finished and two of the men
stepped over to the stone where jimmy sat
one was the man with the stick and the
other the man with the cord jimmys
pulse drummed in his ears and his jaws set
like a vise

  stand up you perry hecht ordered
in a brutal tone

 jimmy jumped up with a suddenness
and a straight out from the shoulder right
and left that sent the two men reeling
he went for hecht no thought of the gun
hecht held restrained him-he but wanted
to reach the fellow and beat him down in
the dirt but instead he went down him-
self one of the other men had leaped on
him and clinched in a mighty embrace they
rolled on the ground

  five minutes later jimmy dazed and
bleeding was raised to his feet he could
not get up by himself for through the hol-
low of his drawn back arms a stick was
thrust and his hands were forced together
in front of him and pinioned with the
braided whipcord a hammer blow could
not have budged the stick

  hecht did not give him a glance he
sent a man on ahead to scout the road
and after an interval the party followed
hecht led a man was on each side of
jimmy and roughly helped him through
the brush a third man brought up the
rear in this wise they came to the
hacienda gate the fifth man joined
them here they turned off to the left
and sheltered by the scrub in the coffee
field made their way toward the woods on
the south of the house jimmy could see
for the flag



the flag on the roof drooping lifelessly in
the baking air his heart swelled at the
sight

  but what jimmy could not see was billy
crouched in the skylight opening sweeping
the approaches to the house with the
binocular it was the third time he had
gone up there since jimmy left each
previous time bringing only a sickening
sense of utter futility now though as
he mechanically quartered the ground
below his glass caught a movement far
down in the corner of the field he waited
scarcely breathing until in another space
he descried the advancing party he
shouted the news to brewer in a queer high
voice

  ive found them they are making for
the woods they are going to come at us
from that side

  there was a pause winifred had run
out from her room at the sound of his shrill
cry she stood at her fathers side by the
ladder her hands clasped to her breast a
groan broke from the boy above

  theyve got jimmy hes in the midst
of them theres something wrong with
him god i see now his arms are tied
a rifle mr brewer ill shoot-no no
i might hit jimmy and they are gone
theyve reached the woods

hecht kept just within the shelter
of the trees so that he could hold
the house in view it brought him
presently to tio diegos hut the old man
was in the act of scurrying from the place
a call from hecht and a leveled pistol
brought him back he was trembling to
his toes and when he saw jimmy bound
and begrimed his seamed face went the
color of lead hecht motioned him into
the hut the others remained outside
jimmy noticed that they placed themselves
to the lee of him and he understood the
reason they were using him as a shield
against the shuttered silent house

 hecht came out shortly he had
scrawled a note in pencil on the back of
one of jimmys envelopes

  you may care to hear this he said
harshly

  he read what he had written

  in the name of the imperial german govern-
ment i demand the surrender of his excellency
herr adolph kaufman the imperial minister to the
state of zanhoria in exchange shall be delivered


to you the person of james perry now in my hands
failure to comply within one hour will result in
the immediate execution of the said james perry
on the spot where he stands

  jimmy gave him a slow mocking look

  you will get kaufman when you haul
down that flag-not before he drawled

  hecht handed the missive to diego

  go and bring me an answer he said to
him in spanish

 the peasant cringed away jimmy
shouted after him in such spanish as he
could muster on the instant

  diego digalejamds-jants never-
never-

  hecht struck him in the mouth with his
open hand

chapter xxviii

a journey for two

a fter don luis left him enrique sat
for many minutes pondering what he
had learned all the inflammatory passions
of his nature were in a seething turmoil
finally he got up and sought his own room
he dressed for the street and departed
from the house in his car he drove
straight to ortegas office in the calle
central ortega was not there

  of course he muttered as he drove
away i should have known good god
how hot it is

  he drove east until he reached the out-
skirts of the city before him rose a tower-
ing adobe wall barely peeping above it
were the eaves of a great oblong building
of solid stone it was the state prison
backed to that encircling adobe wall many
a political offendant had faced a firing-
squad in years past

  at the gate an armed sentry stepped
out from the guard-house and stopped the
car segovia made his name and errand
known and after telephonic communication
with the prison the man informed him that
he could proceed

  it was not the general office he was re-
ceived in the room was evidently set
apart for a specific purpose it was quite
bare except for a thick matting on the floor
a few plain chairs and a large flat desk by
the window ortega sat at this desk a
man with a notebook in his hand was leaving
the room by a door opposite that through
which segovia was ushered in beyond


adventure

the desk in the comer was placed a screen
behind which was a table for the man with
the notebook when an interview was to be
secretly recorded

  ortega greeted segovia with an incurious
smile he had surmised his errand when
his name was telephoned from the gate
he said in his calm unemotional way
yes she is here your uncle has been
talking with you

  segovia nodded for the time he could
find no words he remained standing
before the desk the others leisurely
scrutiny of him brought the red to his brow
don emilio was of course thinking of the
fools part he had played

  he told you i presume pursued
ortega with a reflective air that it was
mrs isaacs who sent the note about the
wireless that it was mrs isaacs who
learned from morales who stole the wash-
ington dispatch that it was mrs isaacs
who planned with his excellency the
american minister the little affair in
dolores street that in brief it is mrs
isaacs suspected by none of us who has
enabled the government to nip this plot
and bring the plotters to justice don
luis has told you this has he not my
friend

  yes broke out segovia he has
must i acknowledge to you as i did to him
that i was a blind fool it is not for that
i came but i will do it if it suits your
humor for i have a favor to ask of you
ortega made a deprecatory motion with
his hand

  my dear fellow one does not require
acknowledgment of a patent fact the
favor you wish to see her

  yes

 why

  there was an eloquent pause the bald
question drove home to segovia he had
come away under the scourge of a black
desire to face this perfidious woman to heap
on her words that would bring her to her
knees before him make her eat of the dust
at his feet and then what what had
he in his heart to do his fingers worked
unpleasantly like claws his lips curled
back from his teeth his body stiffened
into the rigidity of a wild beast about to
spring

  ortega was latin himself and he knew
the signs they did not revolt him he
felt indeed a current of sympathy for the

boy but his years and training-more the
latter than the former-had taught him
the folly of playing to his passions he said
quietly

  why anticipate she will be shot with

the others

  she is to be shot

  enriques fingers slackened there was
a relaxation in all his body the moment
before he could have killed mary taylor
with his own hands now he was suddenly
cleansed of the desire in the flood of a new
emotion what in his unreasoning madness
seemed an act of righteous retribution in
the cold light of ortegas announcement
stood out solely as a base personal revenge
after all mary taylor had simply worked
in her countrys behalf as mrs isaacs had
worked in behalf of hers

  she is to be shot he repeated dully
why you cant do that she is a german
citizen and we are not at war with ger-
many

  we are ortega contradicted the
president has issued the proclamation
kaufmans passports are waiting for him
we have had enough of these plotting
germans we intend to smoke out that
nest of theirs on the negro and send them
packing

  but what she has done is ante-factum
segovia insisted his mind unable to enter-
tain but the one hideous objective lliat
confronted it you cant-

  we can and will interrupted the super-
intendent we are not standing on points
of law these days enrique-not with the
german empire it knows no law he
asked abruptly do you wish to see her
now this ella prietz

  no god no

  enrique recoiled from the thought
what were the petty wounds to his self-
esteem compared with the fate that was
stalking to meet this woman he could
visualize it in every dreadful detail-the
cold gray of the breaking day the blank
bullet-pitted wall the fine supple figure
placed before it the leveled guns the
word of command   

  no no he cried again i have no
account against her it is wiped away

  he took a few perturbed steps about the
room

  that is well said don emilio soberly
now we will proceed to other matters
herr kaufmans detention is no longer
for the flag



necessary if we had delayed a little-
but on the whole the step is not to be re-
gretted we were rid of the man at a
crucial moment today will you go out
there at dark enrique and let jimmy know
what has occurred i will put a closed car
at your disposal to bring them back-
kaufman and those two fine boys it will
be best to return them under cover of
night

  i will go assented segovia indiffer-
ently he did not care now what jimmy
might think for he was lost to the con-
sideration of his own poor vanity he
little dreamed that at this same hour
jimmy also was in peril of his life

some one rapped for admittance
on the door at the superintend-
ents bidding a prison guard entered
he crossed to the desk and spoke in a low
tone ortega gave him a brief word in
reply he viewed segovia thoughtfully
when the guard was gone and said

  the first of our expected guests this
evening has arrived the senor don manuel
morales sit down enrique i believe
i would like to have you stay

  a gleam of interest lighted the young
mans somber eyes it was not for morales
-he was a black traitor and deserved the
fate reserved for him but he would speak
of mary taylor-it was inevitable that he
should-and it was this that invested him
with transitory interest for enrique he
took the seat ortega indicated it was a
little to one side and back of the super-
intendents chair the man with the
notebook entered in response to a button
call and disappeared behind the screen
another button call and the door fronting
the desk opened morales was thrust in
and the door closed

  the heat was oppressive but it was not
altogether this that made the sweat bubble
out on the bankers pasty face and drip
down from his hairless crown his beady
eyes quested about the room passed
segovia over and came to a fascinated stare
on the quiet man leaning back with folded
arms at the desk

  kindly come forward senor requested
the superintendent blandly

  the short heavy figure moved as di-
rected no sound came from him but a
stertorous laboring of the lungs

  you are distressed senor went on the

superintendent is there perhaps some-
thing that i can do to relieve you

  he was playing with him as a cat a
mouse

  an annoying mistake has been made
senor superintendent morales forced
from his dry lips though the voicing of it
was scarcely above a whisper i do not
know why i am brought here - have been
told nothing

  in that case i shall be glad to supply
the omission ortega answered suavely
we are informed that you have plotted
with herr kaufman the german envoy
to overturn the present government of
zanhoria and place general peralta in
power does this enlighten you senor
the banker had with an enormous effort
regained a measure of control over himself
he was reacting to mans primal instinct
to fight for his life and he was misled by
his inquisitors mild manner his voice
rose in strength as he replied

  none of this is so it is an outrage that
a person of position should be haled before
you in this way disgraceful some ma-
licious scoundrel has defamed me i de-
mand the proof senor superintendent
ortega spread his palms apart

  ah now you have asked a question
he appeared to reflect a moment did
not miss prietz acquaint you with her loss
last night

  a tremor ran through morales frame

  i do not understand he declared
through the heavy fear that sat upon him
a distinct bewilderment was manifest

  ortega saw that in this at least the man
was honest the woman had not told him
afraid perhaps for her life she had fled
to the legation and told her story there
and they-now that the fat was in the
fire-had not cared what became of their
zanhorian tools

  you do not know miss prietz he
inquired apparently astonished

  morales was dumb

  ah then i dont wonder that you fail
to understand continued don emilio
softly miss prietz was dispossessed last
night of certain papers she was charged
by general peralta to deliver into herr
kaufmans hand among these papers was
a list of the generals supporters in cortina
and the preferments promised them if the
revolution succeeded do you comprehend
now senor


adventure

  morales assumed bravado had dropped
from him as the last leaf from the naked
tree his face was a shocking picture-
the color of rancid tallow and with the
muscles of it working as though there were
living worms writhing under the skin
enrique turned from the doomed traitor
he felt not pity for him it was sickening
disgust and yet it killed in him also
the final throb of compassion for mary
taylor she had used morales and denied
him his one opportunity of escape ortega
with a singular synchronism of thought was
saying this very thing

  miss prietz should have mentioned it
seiior he purred it deprived you of a
chance-your car the open road and away
it was thoughtless of miss prietz treach-
erous one might even call it

  morales raised an aspen hand

  enough he cried hoarsely he swal-
lowed with difficulty you have taken
her too she is here

  ortega abandoned the re he had played
he sat erect at his desk his expression
was stem and relentless

  yes he replied she is here she was
taken in the attempt to leave the city
she will be tried and shot with the rest of
you

  morales nodded impatiently one would
say

  yes yes i know i know what to
expect

  he came a step nearer the desk his
little eyes were glittering he steadied
his twitching nerves as best he could and
he said

  senor ortega there is a thing she can
tell that is of much importance to the state
i can make her tell it and in reparation
for-for-

  i understand cut in the superintend-
ent why not tell it yourself morales

  because i know only part but with
that i can force her to speak you have
a witness-the senor lieutenant here-
and if you will have her brought in-

  he paused and waited

  ortega considered him keenly his
finger pressed a button to the guard who
answered

  bring to me ella prietz he directed
he looked at enrique there is the
screen if you wish seiior segovia you can
hear distinctly what passes

  enrique made a half-movement to rise

he caught morales gaze fixed on him and
stayed why should he let the man think
that he cared

  there was a stir at the door and mary
taylor was led in at ortegas signal the
guard withdrew the young womans eyes
went first to segovia then to the two
others she was pale and calm and
collected and she was silent she had
been questioned by this police official
before she had nothing to say then
she had nothing to say now ortega spoke
to the banker

  well senor

  morales responded with a short gesture
he walked slowly over to where the girl
stood by the door he stopped a few feet
from her

  we are fortunately met miss prietz
he said in wheedling tones i have been
told that we are going on a journey a
number of us all friends in view of your
devoted consideration for me in particular
i thought that if we went together first-
you and i-in fond companionship-

  god in heaven screamed segovia

  ortega was on his feet leaping toward
the crazed man the stenographer ran
from behind the screen but all too late
a shot split the air and another morales
toppled over with a choking grunt a bullet
through his temple mary taylor sank
slowly down her hands were to her
breast her head drooped lower and lower
and as enrique reached her it fell upon his
outstretched arm saving it from the floor
her clouding eyes dwelt  him for the
beat of a clock to and fro

  forgive she breathed and was gone
on her journey

  the door was crowded with faces peering
in ortega swept them with a withering
glance his mood was harsh for his own
judgment had betrayed him

  you fools he lashed out because he
was not a common cutthroat you did not
think to search him for a weapon

the lincoln lay well under a mile

	 nu  j off the mouth of the rio negro

she had been towed to this position
by el terror after a conference between
lieutenant norris and admiral terrozas
at which the admiral had imparted certain
knowledge he possessed of colonel ludolfs
plans to cover peraltas landing the
lincolns guns were trained on the river

m
for the flag



and her searchlights would scour it through
the night any craft from the lumber camp
that might attempt the open sea would
be blown out of the water the lincolns
wings were clipped but not her claws
and furthermore in response to her calls
a swift united states destroyer was on the
way to the scene

  el terror meanwhile was scouting along
an arc that embraced the possible landings
for the sea bird on the coast admiral
terrozas was inflated with his conquest of
the u and inflamed with the desire to add
to his patriot laurels

chapter xxix

a counter-ultimatum

in the farmhouse winifred stood in
the subdued light of the shuttered
dining-room looking out through a peep-
hole at the scene before the hut she wore
a belt from which hung a pistol billy stood
beside her at the companion port a rifle
was in his hand brewer was at the window
nearer the hall he too held a rifle old
tia matilde sat crumpled up in a chair
against the wall by the pantry door sam
was not present he was on guard in the
front rooms lest a surprise attack come
from that direction

  the heat was sweltering in the closed
room but the three at the windows were
oblivious of it for the time they had
heard the words jimmy shouted to diego
and they saw the blow on the mouth hecht
gave his defenseless prisoner until then-
all their talk and preparation to the con-
trary-the actual spilling of blood in this
emprise had to winifred seemed somehow
a thing remote and without true imminence
now in one breath it took on the full
body of reality she could kill that man
out there

  oh the coward beast the coward
beast she cried a-ah

  jimmy bound though he was had made
a rush at hecht it was of course a vain
effort the german stepped aside and
launched a fist into the broad of jimmys
back as he hurtled by it sent him pitching
headlong in through the door of the
hut

  the mauser in billys hand was up in a
flash there was a snarling unhuman
sound in his throat

  hell pay for that - him he said

thickly

  he was thrusting the rifle through the
port when brewer called to him

  dont later he will pay let us see
first what diego brings it may decide
our actions

  billy reluctantly lowered his gun the
wisdom of brewers position was apparent

  to think of jimmy-jimmy perry-
being knocked about in that way he
muttered

  winifred was silent but her eyes were
flames brewer had gone to the outer door
and was opening it to diego he closed
and locked it after the peasant and signed
to him to enter the dining-room he
followed him in and held out his hand

  give it to me he ordered

  diego delivered to him the envelop on
which hecht had indited his ultimatum
the old man was shaking with fear and
excitement he went and stood dumbly
by tia matilde brewer read out the
note to the others they were all very
still when he finished and very white
winifred was the first to speak her voice
was file-hard rasping out of key

  i know what jimmy meant never
never we are not to surrender that man
in there

  her finger pointed to kaufmans door
across the hall had it been the opening
to the den of a deadly reptile there could
not have been more of abhorrence in the
gesture

  one hour faltered billy one hour
it is five oclock at six-mr brewer
weve got to give him up they will shoot
jimmy before our eyes it would be the
same as if we-ourselves-murdered him

  brewer did not answer he was sunk
in thought

  if they would do it he murmured
if there was a way to get them to do it

  winifred was studying him intently

  tell me father what are you think-
ing she demanded

  he looked at her vaguely obsessed with
the idea he had evolved he spoke as
though she had disputed him

  the trouble is winny it lacks a motive
dont you see there is no inducement
for making the exchange an old man for
a young man-they wouldnt do it

  winifred drew in a long breath he
would save jimmy and he would die


adventure

rather than surrender kaufman even in
this moment of extremity a fierce gladness
filled her she ran to him and caught his
hand she bowed her head to it and
kissed it

  my father oh my dear father the
swelling note of a great tenderness and a
great pride was in her voice i would not
let you do it ah no no

  he threw off partially his abstraction
his arm went about her

  if it only could be done winny if it
only could you could hold out the four
of you and i-i would be to some extent

canceling-

  she hushed him with her finger to his
lips her thought was of billy though
the boys thought was on neither of them
it was with jimmy-out there bound and
helpless kicked about brutally his life
hanging on the decision they should make
in here he was at the window again
watching the hut

  they would not do it father winifred
contended and jimmy he would not
consent dont you know that he would
not we must think up another way to
save him and we must not delay father
the minutes are flying

  billy swung around to them

  i tell you we must let kaufman go
he cried stubbornly there is no other
way they may not wait they may
shoot jimmy before the hour is up

  cuidadol

  it was a croaking whisper from tio diego
he had come forward a little from the wall
his arm was outstretched toward kauf-
mans room the minister had succeeded
in clawing back the slide and was peering
at them he had overheard billy

  swine he shouted you would let
me smother in this accursed hole but i
have heard ja and i have seen i
know my men i know what they will do
release me and the scoundrel shall five

release me-

  kaufman dropped away from the opening
with a squeal of fright winifred had
snatched the pistol from her belt and fired-
point-blank at him he believed but the
bullet-hole high above where his head had
been indicated her intent it was to
produce exactly the effect that followed
he would keep away from the door after this
billy gritted out-

  i wish you had killed him

  the tiger is in every woman and it leaps
forth when she is aroused winifreds
face was flushed with the surge of suddenly
unleashed passions if jimmy was to die

he should be avenged

 the next time-

  she did not finish but moved to the
nearest window and gazed darkly at the
hut it was too far away for hecht and
his crew to have heard the shot distinctly
the thick walls of the house would muffle
it they were standing around discussing
something in their ponderous german
fashion jimmy was nowhere to be seen
was he lying inside there felled to the
ground by hechts barbarous blow her
heart grew hot within her

  sam had come running up to see what
the trouble was brewer sent him back
to his post and crossed over to kaufmans
room he drew the bolt and opened the
door and he surveyed the minister with
an oddly meditative air as one might
consider to what use he could put an un-
familiar implement offered to his hand
kaufman did not speak he had retired
to the other end of the room completely
unnerved for the moment his fingers
clutched at his thick neck as if he were
stifling

brewers expression changed
it became alert elated almost he
closed the door pushed the panel to
and returned with a lively step to the
dining-room

  ive got it he announced they
wont dare to carry out their threat
winifred turned to him wonderingly
afraid to believe billy clamored for him
to proceed

  what is it sir for gods sake be
quick

  i shall answer their note i shall say
to them that if they do not return jimmy
to us unharmed we shall hang kaufman
by the neck from the ridge-piece of the
porch we need but the rope and that
is in the yard-this old womans clothes-
line i will go and get it for they must
have visible evidence that we are prepared
to act on our word

  and by heaven we will shrilled billy
only i will go not you sir

  he was alive with hope again he was
running to the door when winifred stayed
him
 

for the flag	

  neither of you shall go she declared
to see a man gathering in the rope would
raise suspicion in them but to see a
woman do it will only puzzle them i am
going

  they protested vehemently these men
were germans they would as lief shoot
down a woman as a man she should
not go

  winifred made an end to argument with
an imperious hand

  i will do it can you not shoot if they
make a move let me pass

  her look compelled hem her step
was even and deliberate inside at the
windows two mausers covered the hut
there would be a deadly reckoning for the
hun who raised a hand against that small
slim form

  the girl detached the line from the
supports going from post to post in a
business-like manner she coiled the line
methodically as she went along she felt
singularly devoid of fear singularly intent
on this one thing she was doing her
thoughts did not go beyond it

  the germans were standing perfectly
still watching her they had ceased
talking she was a dozen yards nearer
them when her task so far was ended
she did not cast a glance in their direction
apparently they did not exist for her she
walked back to the house with the same
deliberate step and they watched her in
the same bewildered silence the extraor-
dinary procedure held them as in a spell
they were unable to fathom what it fore-
told and it was this that winifred had
counted on

  but now that they could not see her
hands she was busy with the line working
swiftly surely she came to the porch and
paused brewer called to her urgently
from his port in the shutter he seemed
to know what she intended

  child comein i am in agony for you

  she did not heed him the ridge-piece
projected several inches from the porch
at the end it was hewn into a knob in a
rough attempt at an ornamental finish
winifred gaged it with her eye it was
eight feet above her from the topmost
step she hesitated then with her whole
will to succeed she cast the coiled line up
at the beam it was a ten-strike the
line fell across the beam and down on the
farther side

  she pulled at the end she had retained
in her hand and a slip-noose dangled in the
air she looked then at the germans
her head scornfully high and went into
the house even then the men made not
a sound they did not understand for to
associate the imperial envoys neck with
that pendent cord was a thing so incon-
ceivable that it could not find lodgment in
their skulls

  oh girl girl i could kiss your shoes
for that cried out billy

  she answered with a strained smile and
sank weakly into a chair her knees all
at once had given way brewer was at
the table writing he had slit open the
envelop on which hechts message was in-
scribed and was penciling on the inner side
his counter-ultimatum

  billy in the interim was talking rapidly
with diego though he still held his place
at the window to keep the germans in view
a project that had been forming in his
mind had taken definite shape at a stage
of their talk the old peasant drew from
under his dingy shirt a long keen sheath-
knife he felt the edge wagging his head
knowingly and replaced it with care in
his lack-luster eyes was a gleam of cupidity
a passion that masters fear if all went well
he was a made man he would have a farm
of his own billy had pledged it to him
in jimmys name

  brewer stood up he beckoned to di-
ego

  not yet interjected billy i want
ten minutes the start of him we have
half an hour left and ive got a plan it
may pan out anyway im going to try it
neiderlein isnt with that bunch over there
or landeker ive never seen any of them
before well my scheme is to join them
and turn jimmy loose

  winifred caught at her breath

  billy they will find you out

  dont interrupt he barked at her and
went on in sharp short sentences im a
cortina german and in the know neider-
lein has sent me news peralta has been
taken an american war-ship got him
the city is in arms against the germans
hecht is not to bringkaufman back there
something like that-ill fix it up right
but kaufman will see you with them
he will call out and warn them if he can
make them understand at this distance
objected winifred


adventure

  he wont have time listen now
i am going out at the front down the hill
then across the field toward the woods
ill be hallooing for hecht hell answer
hell have to and then is the time to send
diego with the note a little after wont
hurt and we will keep piling up the con-
fusion

  when you see me with hecht at the hut
talking turn sam out the back door
have him shake his fist at the house-
yell-cuss-make a row you will shoot
at him and he will run keep shooting
he can stagger as if hes hit but he must
run on he will circle around to the hut
and when he gets there he must knock
the first man down he can reach diego
will have set jimmy free and slipped him
a gun ill take care of hecht do you
get my idea therell be three of us to
five four if diego counts not such a
bad break for us especially if we get the
drop on them

  winifred had risen to her feet

  you will be killed-all of you she
gasped

  and yet in spite of the dread a faint hope
was beating at her heart

  have you thought of the risk billy
it was brewers only approach to dis-
suasion

  there was a fixed resolve in the boys
look as he answered

  i have but im not going to sit here
and let them keep jimmy tied up like a dog
your plan checks them but it doesnt give
us jimmy back we cant go on with a
stalemate forever and they will carry
him along if they decide to leave i dont
intend to wait for that im off take
this mauser winifred a pail of water
somebody ive swum the river and my
clothes have got to show it

chapter xxx

xiie fight at the hut

jimmy did not go down under hechts
blow a rough straddle-legged table
planted firmly in the dirt floor of the hut
saved him he sprawled across it groveled
on it and regained his footing in the
grievous heat the water rained unhindered
from his face on to his fettered hands
they were swollen and numb the stick
at his back bit into him until his spine

was near to cracking with it but he
minded it not a murderous wrath con-
sumed him he wanted more than life
to get at hecht not with any weapon of
mans make but with those nature had
given him-his naked fists he wanted to
feel the impact of them on hechts flesh
battering it to a pulp

  the fit passed blind passion would not
get him anywhere and he had need of all
his wits he looked about him there
was an opening in the wall on each side that
answered for a window at the rear a door
led out directly into the forest there was
no escape for him in that direction bound
as he was it would be useless to attempt it
they would take him before he had gone
two rods

  a stool was on the other side of the table
it was all that jimmy noted of the squalid
furnishings he went around to it and
sat down it was a change of position
nothing more it brought him little ease
of body the table was high and he could
not rest even a rigid elbow on it but from
this point he could view what went on
before the door and beyond he could see
the house

 he wondered what answer they would
make to hechts message and if diego had
repeated to them the charge he had called
after him the man was frightened out
of his skin he might not have heard or
hearing might have let the words go in
one ear and out the other would brewer
in this event surrender kaufman jimmy
prayed that he would not it would mean
that the flag must come down and solely
because of his own pig-headed folly he
cursed himself as he thought of it he
would rather die far rather than to live
on in the knowledge that it was for him
those starry folds were lowered and yet
to die trussed up like a barnyard fowl ready
for the oven   

  they were talking in low tones out in
front of the hut possibly for the reason
that they fancied he was conversant with
german aside from this a wide stillness
reigned not a sound of bird or beast
broke upon it not a whispering murmur
from the tall tree-tops all about it seemed
like the quiet of a world hushed in a dread
expectant pause

  jimmy saw the door of the house open
and winifred come forth he rose his
heart in his mouth he lost sight of her
for the flag



as she moved toward the kitchen and he
stepped quietly over to the window on his
left that he might keep her in view like
those others in front he was mystified by
her actions yet he knew that some vital
urge impelled her his breath came short
and hard as he watched and it went out
in a long sigh of immeasurable relief when
she was once again at the door he watched
her as did the others cast the rope over
the ridge-piece and dimly he began to
understand then as she turned and for
the first time cast a glance at the germans
the whole truth burst in on him

  that is their answer he exclaimed
and oh isnt she plucky

  he returned to the stool to think on what
would follow brewer would send his
defiance to hecht and then what what
would be the next move hecht would not
dare to shoot him now but he would keep
him a prisoner just the same where was
the way out for either side from the im-
passe

  hecht came to the door while he was
studying the problem and flung a question
at him

  have you moved his excellency to
another room

  are you speaking of the man kaufman
counter-questioned jimmy coolly

  hecht gave him a poisonous look

  i am speaking of herr adolph kaufman
the imperial-

  never the mind the rattle to his tail
cut in jimmy no they havent moved
him

  then why are the windows closed

  to keep the flies out or in ive for-
gotten which

  hecht took a menacing step toward him
jimmy did not stir but he pinned his eyes
on the german with an expression that
involuntarily halted him

  if he said you have any idea of
striking me again i wouldnt hecht
you dont want to add to my score against
you for when i get at you-as i will-
i shall stop just short of beating out your
brains another blow and i wont stop at
that

  when you get at me hecht laughed
his contempt if in half an hour herr
kaufman is not released you will be lying
out there with a hole in your head perry
that is as near as you will come to getting
at me i can promise you that

  jimmy looked him over coldly

  its a waste of breath i suppose but
i will make you a proposition hecht-its
your only chance to deliver kaufman
cut this cord and stand up before me with
your fists do me in and you shall have
your man i pledge my word to it if
i do you in im to go free now if you are
not entirely the dirty coward youve shown
yourself to be you will take me up if
you dont and you shoot me you will see
kaufman swinging at the end of that rope
over there the minute afterward thats
what its for hecht i can promise you
that

  this monstrous statement swept the
teutons mind of the personal implication
the challenge carried the kaisers envoy
to be hanged by the neck like a common
malefactor it was beyond the pale of
reason it was an impossibility he stared
at jimmy seeking in him some evidence
of impaired sanity jimmy guessed his
thought

  if you dont believe it hecht take me
out and shoot me he taunted it is
plain that you are not man enough to
settle this thing as ive proposed you
are the kind we read about-baby-killers

  for one instant jimmys life hung by a
thread the germans hand went to his
pistol he drew it haf-forth from his belt
hesitated and with an oath thrust it back
the dangling rope over there beyond had
flashed on his mental vision

  from a distance in the coffee-field came
a call

  leutnant herr hecht leutnant ilerr

hecht

  a man looked in at the door and spoke
to the lieutenant he went out in haste
jimmy heard the call again nearer by and
heard hecht answer-a harsh command
it seemed to him silence ensued a wait
probably for whoever it was to come up

  and then issuing from the house jim-
my saw tio diego he moved sluggishly
toward the hut as though loath to arrive
there was something white in his hand-
a slip of paper all at once his step livened
but jimmy forgot him in the amazing scene
that claimed his eyes

  billy passed before the door with hecht
they were talking in german hecht
gruffly questioning billy replying with
dramatic vigor not for the wink of an
eyelash did his glance stray the prisoners


adventure

way they paused a little to the left of
the entrance jimmy could catch a glimpse
of hecht gesticulating violently the re-
maining germans gradually approached the
spot curiosity drawing them

  and now diego arrived cringing servilely
he extended the note to hecht and cowered
away but not toward the house inch by
inch as the germans crowded up to their
leader to hear the message read diego
neared the door of the hut jimmy might
have been of stone for any movement that
he made a drama was being played in
which there was a part reserved for him
this he understood and he knew that
presently it would be revealed to him

  diegos back showed at the edge of the
door if a chance eye had been directed
to him he was merely leaning against the
wall humbly waiting for their excellencies
to have their will of him but of a sudden
his back straightened an outcry had
proceeded from the house a great voice
rent the air and pistol-shots followed
with a catlike bound diego was inside the
hut the slash of a knife and jimmy was
free and diego at the door again

jimmy thrashed his numbed arms
against his sides he toiled with
his hands one with the other and
bit into them with his teeth until the blood
flowed life came surging back into them
and he was at last able to grasp the revolver
diego had left for him on the table he
jumped over to the window sam was
running toward the hut he came on
bellowing like a stampeded steer jimmy
heard billys voice raised excitedly to hecht
and conjectured that he was trying to allay
the others distrust of the remarkable
proceeding

  billy will give me a signal-surely-
surelyt jimmy breathed

  sam had stopped running he was
within a few feet of the watching group
jimmy slipped around to the door keeping
close to the wall diego had moved away
he was standing behind a big german
whose hand was on his gun diegos hand
was in his shirt bosom

  sam was up to them now-in the midst
of them he was laboring it seemed for
speech but his was not a speaking part
if he had been told what to say he could
not have remembered it in this hasty role
he had assumed he raised his hand in an

uncouth attempt at a military salute-and
it and the other hand doubled into huge
granite fists crashed full into the faces of
the two nearest germans they went
down like slaughtered beeves with the
action billys automatic was jabbed into
hechts stomach

  now jimmy he shouted and
hands up to hecht

  jimmy was already out and at work
sams attack had been a sufficient signal
for him diegos man was reeling with a
gushing knife-wound deep in his neck-
dying on his feet the peasant his courage
suddenly gone was in full flight for the
shelter of the woods the fifth man had
fired at him and missed he wheeled at
jimmys appearance and they both let go
at the same instant jimmy felt a searing
streak on his temple the germans pistol-
arm dropped a strangling cough distorted
his features he doubled up and came in a
lump to the ground the other german
fell over kicked convulsively and lay quiet

  jimmy put his hand to his head blood
was on it when he took it away it had
been a narrow squeak for him he started
over where billy held hecht at pistol-point
sam was rising up from the two huns he
had felled they had come to but the
negro had their weapons corraled

  jes drawin deir teeth boss he
grinned as jimmy passed him

  you are a prince sam commended
jimmy gather up those other tools
back there as for these chaps kick them
off the lot we dont want any prisoners
to billy he said simply-i owe you one
old man

  not till you have frisked this skunk of
his gun the boy replied for two cents
id save you the trouble he growled at
hecht keep those hands up

  thirty seconds would have covered the
dramas action from the time of billys
warning shout but there was an epilogue
to come jimmy devised it and in the
heat of his desire all else was forgotten-
the men lying dead by the door of the hut-
kaufman-winifred-brewer-all things in
heaven and earth but this man hecht

  i wouldnt have you harm him billy
for all the money in the mint he said in a
silky voice i promised him something
in there and im going to give it to him
right now i cant wait

  he took hechts pistol from him and
for the flag



his own the one he had been relieved of
at the riverside he passed them over to
billy together with the revolver diego had
brought him hecht did not speak but
his eyes flashing from one to the other were
hells of hate kaufman was bawling ob-
jurgations at him from his vent in the
shutters he had seen everything and
hecht knew that his career was closed

  now you baby-killer put up your
hands jimmy ordered

  he squared away for the germans
attack so intent was he on the business
before him that he did not notice that
brewer and winifred had come out of the
house and were in the yard watching the
astounding affair they had brought their
rifles with them old tia matilde cowered
behind on the steps nor did billy remark
them he stood by with shining eyes
this was as it should be jimmy was going
to wipe out in the only way possible the
indignities to which he had been subjected

  but hecht did not put up his fists the
decent art of self-defense was not his he
lowered his head and rushed in with
taloned fingers clutching for his opponents
throat it was childs play for jimmy this
he leaped aside and planted a blow behind
hechts ear that sent him plowing into the
dirt

  one cried billy oh boy

  de lawd bless me chuckled sam

  he had obeyed jimmy literally and
kicked his two germans into the coffee-
field and he had turned in time to see
hecht go down

  the man climbed heavily to his feet
he dashed the sweat from his eyes and
his lesson learned he crouched and began
warily circling around his foe if he could
close with him get a wrestling hold he
would know his way then jimmy saw
what hecht was up to he did not intend
to let the fellow come to a clinch with him
he was not too sure of that freshly healed
lung of his and besides the thought of a
straining embrace with the brute nauseated
him

  come on you boche he invited softly
i knew there was no such thing as a stand-
up fight in you come on and strike me
in the mouth you did it once

  hecht believed he saw an opening and
rushed in his rage carried him smashing
through jimmys guard but before he
could make his grip fast jimmy shot in a

short-arm jab to his jaw that staggered him
it gave jimmy the chance to throw him off
and in the same motion he got in a vicious
uppercut to his chin hecht tottered back
spun around dizzily and dropped

  two counted billy rapturously

   a shrill flesh-creeping cry pierced the air
jimmy swung around from the supine
teuton tia matilde was fleeing from
the porch to winifred her hands raised in
terror above her head behind her in the
door kaufmans bearded face showed for a
moment a raucous laugh rolled from his
lips and the door was banged to

  on his last visit to the man brewer had
neglected to shoot the bolt that held him
prisoner and he had found it out and in
the living-room were loaded guns-two
mausers a colt and kaufmans own
hammerless s  w

chapter xxxi

brewer

tt was a meteoric moment winifred
and brewer stood looking uncertainly
at the closed door the baleful occurrence
seemed to have dazed them

  to the kitchen winifred quick
quick jimmy shouted

  he grabbed a pistol from billy and set
out full tilt for the girl

  hecht had got to his feet but he was
unarmed and they paid him no attention
billy started to follow jimmy sam from
the background where he had been collect-
ing the weapons of the dead germans ran
forward and then came what was near to
proving billys end with his second step
he tripped and fell the pistols piled in
his hands scattered right and left in a
twinkling hecht had pounced on one and
roaring his triumph drew it down on the
prostrate boy but the bullet plowed harm-
lessly into the ground hccht had been
a second too late sam fired first not ten
feet from him and the  bored his body
through from side to side

  good boy sam yapped billy as he
scrambled up and retrieved the guns he
had spilled

  sam scooped up the one hecht had
dropped and they raced on leaving the
hun gurgling out his life in the trodden
dirt both jimmy and brewer had stopped
at the mans savage cry but before either


adventure

could shoot the negro had dispatched him

  they all crowded into the kitchen-house
it was under twenty yards from the dining-
room but the solid stone walls defied any-
thing short of a field-piece they had but
to keep away from the window and kauf-
man would not have a chance at them
from the southeast window of his prison
room he could have commanded the door
had not the shutters been nailed fast but
the angle was too sharp for accurate aim
through the peepholes the situation
however was not without its danger and
moreover it was humiliating the trap-
pers were trapped

  it was my criminal carelessness brewer
groaned

  jimmy did not understand but it was no
time for futile questions billy and sam
were depositing their superfluous pistols on
a chair billy turned abruptly and ex-
claimed

  i say whats to prevent kaufman
from going quietly out at the front and
scooting off he may have done it already

  this was a new thought to them for until
then it had been fixed in their minds that
the minister would hold the house till an-
other rescuing party should arrive nei-
derlein would certainly send more men and
probably head them himself to learn why
hecht did not return to the legation he
would not know of the cloudburst and the
delay consequent upon it even now he
might be on his way to the farm

  kaufman was brought here in the night
said winifred reflectively he doesnt
know the country it is likely i dont think
he would venture out alone and he doesnt
know how many of us he has to deal with
he may think we have some one stationed
in the trees at the front to watch the door

  the answer to their problem was start-
lingly unexpected brewer had put his
rifle aside and immersed in thought was
moving toward the back of the kitchen
where was another door giving into a smaller
room which in turn opened on a narrow
strip between the kitchen-house and the
precipitous hillside on the west he passed
before the window instantly a gun spoke
and a bullet whistled through the window
it missed brewer only by an inch or so

  father gasped winifred white with
fear

  hes found the guns cried billy he
is going to keep us here

  in two hours it will be dark then we
can do something said jimmy he cant
guard all the windows at one and the same
time

  but if he gets reinforcements those
chaps we let go will tear back to the city
in their car neiderlein will come out with
a bigger bunch billy wrinkled his nose
but not in comedy now gee jimmy it
doesnt look any too good to me

  jimmy glanced over at brewer he did
not seem to be upset by his narrow call
he wore rather an abstracted air that took
no account of his surroundings he beck-
oned to jimmy with a slight gesture and
jimmy ducking below the window-sill
went to him winifred still in the clutch
of her fright leaned limply against the wall
and watched them but for a moment
only brewer led the way into the adjoin-
ing room and closed the intervening door
he spoke rapidly and quietly

  it is an enormity-kaufman holding
the house with the flag flying over him it
is my fault and it is my business to find the
remedy there is a way and i will attempt
it

  what way broke in jimmy puzzled
the doors are fast and the shutters are
bolted on the inside

  you have forgotten the skylight

  the skylight

  it shot through jimmys mind that all
these events had affected the mans reason
brewer answered calmly

  exactly that it is open and the lad-
der in the hall is up it is not probable that
kaufman has removed it

  oh interrupted jimmy again but the

thing is impossible -sir how-

  wait enjoined brewer curtly there
is another ladder it lies along the east
side of the house it was used i imagine
for repairing the roof at any rate it is
there i shall raise it and go up in my
stocking feet for a better foothold on the
tiles i will go down through the skylight
and surprise kaufman in the dining-room
your part is to keep him busy until i can
get away

  jimmy gazed at him in silence

  by jove he breathed at last and
then i believe it could be done only how
will you get from here to the east side of
the house kaufman will shoot you
down

  brewer led him to the outer door
for the flag



cti there he said if i can
reach the edge i can claw my way
along below eye-range and come up
at the farther end

  and a slip would send you to the bot-
tom mr brewer this is work for a

younger man i want you to let me-

  brewer stopped him with a remonstrant
hand a flickering inscrutable smile played
about his mouth and vanished

  i have i think a special strength for
this he said when you came to me
the other day and told what was required
of me it-well it meant new life to me it
meant what a shipwrecked man must feel
who sees a sail come up over the horizon
when he has lost all hope-a ship flying his
countrys flag i cant very well make you
understand mr perry but this work is for
me alone it is for no other

  he hesitated and brought out a key from
his pocket

  if anything happens to me this will open
my box at the credito mercantil in cortina
there is money in it a great deal of money
and there are papers you will understand
when you read them winifred will know
what to do it is what i shall do if i live to
see this thing finished she-winifred-

faithful through all-

  his voice broke and he did not go on
jimmy reached out and took his hand
he looked steadily into brewers eyes

  i do not have to read the papers to
understand he said with feeling be-
tween you and me and winifred all is well
sir you are going to succeed-mr bow-
man-and you are going home with us when
all this is over in honor and high regard
brewer shivered as with cold his head
sank upon his breast

  you know he choked

  from the first i have known but what
i did not know was that i should come to
this downright liking for you you have
won it sir and how it shall be my privilege
to tell the world

  brewers head came up gradually in
his look was indeed the hope of the rescued
castaway he gripped jimmys hand in
both his own but he said only-

  i am going now

  wait one minute until you hear the
firing jimmy cautioned him you can
make your break under cover of it good
luck sir and remember we are all pulling
for you

  he returned to the others winifred
mutely questioned him with her eyes he
told her in a dozen words what her father
had undertaken to do

  now billy-sam-stand back from the
door and start shooting out of it when i
call not too fast and not together two
shots each

  for himself he caught up brewers rifle
and warily poked the muzzle out of the
window corner so that it very nearly shel-
tered him from view only a minute por-
tion of his arm and shoulder showed

  now he called

  with each shot from the door jimmy
pumped one at the dining-room praying it
would find kaufman at the port he selected
for his doubtful aim the combined effect
was as if all six shots were delivered at the
house kaufman returned hesitantly what
he possibly took for a fusilade and yet
could not see where it came from he
fired once or twice at the kitchen window
and then was silent jimmy ran into the
back room and looked out brewer was
gone the ruse had diverted attention
from his movements

  if i could watch how he gets along
murmured jimmy

  the dining-room commanded both the
front and rear doors of the kitchen but
jimmy calculated that with a cautious step
out of the rear door and flattening himself
close to the wall he could gain the shelter
of the south side and from that point mov-
ing back a little he could see the roof of
the big house ten seconds would do
it

  he tried it and succeeded without draw-
ing kaufmans fire he was protected from
the dining-room but he perceived that
should kaufman take a notion to go to his
own room to reconnoiter the kitchen terri-
tory he could with a slant shot pot any one
who moved outside a limited area in the
flank of the building but from within
this area jimmy found that the skylight
was in plain sight and it was a degree
cooler here than in the low-ceiled kitchen

  he returned in the same guarded man-
ner and reported his discovery tia ma-
tilde would not budge she sat crouched
against the wall with the determination to
remain there until all danger had passed
but the others ducked under the window
to jimmy he took charge of winifreds
rifle and instructed her how to proceed

m


adventure

  go first lie directed i will be in
close touch of you

  his idea was to shield her should kauf-
man glimpse them

  his purpose was clear to the girl for
just a moment her eyes rested on him-on
his blood-stained cheek-with soft intensity
then in quiet obedience she stepped out of
the door he was instantly at her side
billy followed with brewers rifle and then
sam the great bulk of the negro was not
so easily flattened against the wall the
crack of a mauser came from the dining-
room and sam sputtered an exclamation

  o-o-o i cudnt a slipped er sheet o
writin paper tween dat an me

       they reached the safety zone with-
out further incident and they stood
 with their eyes on the flag hanging
slack on its pole over the skylight billy
took advantage of the respite to reload the
magazine of brewers gun

  i hope kaufman doesnt start to ram-
bling about the house he said nervously
it would be easy to see mr brewer or hear
him at the living-room windows

or he might go up to the roof and
then-if he should see father coming do
you think he might do that jimmy
winifred laid a trembling hand on his
arm he laid his own over it reassuringly

  dont think hed attempt it he an-
swered that ladder is mighty shaky
and this move of ours will set him to guess-
ing he will try to figure out what we are
up to and he wont venture away from this
side of the house he will want to keep a
watch on us

  ill tell you something you dont know
jimmy said billy earnestly mr brewer
wanted to make a deal with hecht to ex-
change places with you-to be shot in your
place if it came to that

  he did said jimmy very quietly i
wish i had known it before billy

  he met winifreds eyes they were
humid he pressed her hand and it re-
sponded they fell quiet after this all of
them waiting tensely for brewers appear-
ance on the tiles a tremendous stillness
wrapped the earth so still was it that
they heard or fancied they did the scrap-
ing of the ladder brewer was erecting against
the roof

  my lawd wats dat ejaculated sam
in a scared voice

  they looked in the direction in which he
was pointing bounding out from the woods
near the hut was a great tan-colored beast
spotted black with a white breast and belly
it stopped in the open its long sinewy
tail switched from side to side and its furry
ears were flattened to its head

  a jaguar whispered billy some-
thing is wrong or it would never come this
near a house

  they gazed fascinated at the giant cat
it saw them but it took no note of them
it held a curious listening poise and now
its head went up and a deep hoarse cry-
pu pu-issued from its throat it bounded
off into the coffee-field

  suddenly billy swore under his breath
and then lifted his voice in a warning
shout-

  regrese diego regresel

  from around the back of the stables to
the right trotting toward them came the
old peasant from his skulking-place in the
woods he had seen them gathered out
there by the kitchen wall and imagined
probably that no danger threatened for he
did not know the true state of affairs

  he paused at billys call a fatal moment
a spurt of flame burst from the southeast
window of the house diego turned to run
another shot and diego rolled over and
over and lay in a huddled heap and still
another shot followed a scream echoed
with it old tia matilde staggered into
view she whirled about rocked to and
fro-and there was a second motionless
huddle on the ground matilde had come
forth at the sound of her husbands name
forgetful of the hazard and kaufman had
shot her down

  my god the butchering brute thun-
dered jimmy he sprang out from the
sheltering wall and poured the five shots
in his mauser into one vent and then the
other of kaufmans windows billy was
with him firing in the same furious rage
there was no reply kaufman had emp-
tied the magazines of his guns or a bullet
had found him

  but another sight claimed them brewer
was on the roof he was at the skylight
and what they had not noticed in these
last fierce minutes a torrid air had sprung up
it rippled out the folds of the flag above
brewer he looked down atthem and then
up at the flag for a moment they saw
him thus-and were hurled flat on their
for the flag



faces in the roar and crash of a world-shak-
ing convulsion

  it came again and again they lay where
they had been dashed down bruised and
stunned they had no voice with which
to shriek their fears each recurrent shock
seemed to lift and crush them down

  horrible beast-cries came from the for-
est all about were sounds of grinding
slipping earth of great boulders hurtling
down the hill and now descended on them
a rain that held no moisture-a soft
stealthy rain of ashes borne on the increas-
ing breeze from old borazo awakened fully
after these many years to a devouring activ-
ity it was an hour from sunset but the
gloom of a dying twilight was on the land

  a pause came in the shocks it grew
longer lengthened into minutes but the
filthy rain still fell and over in the south
was a pale ghastly glow reflected from the
molten lava the volcano was spewing up
from its bowels

  jimmy put out a groping hand

  winifred he called in a labored whis-
per winifred-winifred

  her hand touched his she had fallen
close to him

  jimmy she whispered back

  billy-sam he called

  they answered and presently one by
one they ventured to their knees and
finally with a painful effort to their feet
they stared about them in the gloom hot-
eyed and horror-bound only a mound
of stone where the kitchen had been lay
between them and the house and the
house-it was but a greater mound part
of it had tumbled down the cliff which had
been shorn away to the very foundation of
the building

  the stables were gone brewers car lay
buried deep under the wreckage there
was not an upstanding stick or stone within
their view they were alone these four
on a broken barren hill-crest the only
breathing human creatures of all those that
had peopled it an hour before

  father father it scarcely stirred
the awful stillness so low and tremulous a
note it was

  jimmys arm went around the desolate
girls bowed form he drew her gently to
him and her head rested on his breast
and they stood thus for many minutes in
the soft smothering abhorrent rain from
mount borazo

chapter xxxii

homeward bound

it was saturday noon jimmy sat with
the hon john henry lane in the im-
provised quarters of the american legation
over a tobacco shop on the plaza central
jimmy had just come in before them lay
the ruins of the three-story hotel europa
up on the calle commercio the legation
building was a heap of rubbish but the
german legation stood intact though its
doors were closed

  the death of the imperial envoy was
recorded with spartan brevity in la cro-
nica he had been visiting in the country
and with his host was buried in the ruins
of the house this so it was stated was
the only fact known at present in short
the government had seen to it that the
burden of explanatory details should rest
with the legation if it cared to shoulder it
lane was speaking

  it is pretty bad james some forty
buildings are wrecked and two hundred
lives lost by present reports the list may
grow now tell me just what happened
out there from the beginning please
ive worried myself sick about you and
i see you have had a hurt

  that jimmy touched his temple con-
temptuously a miss is as good as a mile
it is nothing

  as briefly as he could he narrated what
had occurred up to the moment of the
quake his face was very grave

  when we were able to get our wits to-
gether he went on we groped our way
down through the coffee-field to the santa
marta road and from there to the river
and always in that hideous velvet rain of
stinking ashes

  he shuddered as he recalled it

  we waited there for ages black night
came on and there was another shock
but only a tremor this time it scared us
though i can promise you the river had
fallen so that if it had been day we could
have crossed but we were afraid to try it
in the dark and then came the lights of
a car on the other side we shouted and-
oh ill cut it short i cant think of it
quietly it was enrique-good old en-
rique he hadnt forgotten us in all the
tragedies of the day on the way in we
passed an overturned car it had been


adventure

caught in the quake those two germans
were under it and dead the road was
pretty bad in spots but enrique made it
and took us to his home don luis house
he drew a long breath and continued
enrique told us about mary taylor-
her death - and i knew what the telling
cost him we did not press him for par-
ticulars by heaven mr lane ive been
living with men since i struck in here-
men enrique billy smith black sam-
god bless him-and brewer you didnt
know brewer i believe you told me

  he scanned lane closely

  no he never called at the legation
i did not know him

  there was a short pause then jimmy
said slowly

  no matter how this kaufman business
resolves itself in retrospect no matter
whether it helped or did not help brewers
soul was in it he died for it-the death
of a man-under his own flag

  there was another pause lane broke it
and mr brewers daughter you have
scarcely mentioned her james

  jimmy gave him a straight look

  she is very lonely and she is very deso-
late mr lane and i love her is it
enough for me to say or- his expression
lightened-shall i tell you that  i can
prevail on her she will be my wife before
the boat sails for home tomorrow to-
night if she will consent

  lane started in his chair

 why-god bless me-my dear boy
ah-er-humph you have a sudden way
with you but a thousand good wishes
james-ten thousand

  he grasped jimmys hand and wrung
it fervently the ghost of a grin flitted
across jimmys face

  i will collect afterward he said and
meanwhile if you can send around to me
presently four hundred dollars of the nine
hundred i left with you ill be obliged it
will be enough to buy us some presentable
clothes and get us home there will be
three of us in the party for of course sam
will go along

but why not all the money james
the rest is for a small remembrance to
billy smith-after i am gone i will ask
you to attend to that for me sir billy

you know is out of a job-

  the devil he is roared the hon john
henry with all the work before me

now as soon as we see you out of town
he will have to buckle to and help whitta-
ker and by the way you are lucky about
the railroad the quake did not damage
it seriously the trains can run mrs
isaacs got in last night with only a minor
delay

  mrs isaacs jimmy stared his aston-
ishment is she back again looking for
her uncle

  lane guffawed

  oh so enrique has not toldou the
hon john henry enjoyed his surprise
even ortega did not suspect her at first
i will tell you about her

  and he did chuckling greatly he
added

  they have had news from terrozas
today he wired the full story he inter-
cepted the peralta expedition bagged the
whole outfit and brought them into puerto
mono our gunboat settled the arraca
business blocked the river mouth so they
couldnt send their launches out it seems
also that there was a german u about and
terrozas settled that account he has
developed into a great figure in the state
i will have particulars about the u today
lieutenant norris is coming up to see me
he talked these matters over at greater
length for jimmys enlightenment when
he concluded jimmy rose to go

  well he remarked with deep satisfac-
tion ive had a small hand in one little
shindy now im going home home to take
a hand in the big one ive filed a cable
to father saying that im safe and sailing
tomorrow

  did you mention the surprise you have
in store for him hinted the minister slyly

  jimmy answered with a return of his
former seriousness

  no sir that is something i cant
reduce to a telegraphic announcement and
i want to say mr lane that when i am
home again and have seen father and uncle
allan you will get from them a personal
appreciation of your kindness to me as
for my own thanks i wont try to put them
in words

  lane followed him to the door radiating
pleasure

  if it is to be tonight james he de-
claimed unctuously i must be informed
at an early hour i wish to communicate
with senor ortega and his excellency the
president i dont know but it may be
for the flag



that the president will attend i can swear

hell want to for myself-

  i saysir cried jimmy but lane rolled
on in full swing unheeding of him

  of course it is my privilege as the repre-
sentative of our sovereign country to give
away this fair-er-a-humph-daughter of
the flag don enrique will stand up with
you i presume and if perchance an attend-
ant on the bride is desired there is mrs
isaacs a less alluring daughter i will

grant but american to the core and-

  my dear sir shouted jimmy strug-
gling to keep his countenance i havent
asked miss brewer to marry me yet i
have only hopes

  w-what exclaimed the astounded man
but i am going to ask her inside of
half an hour jimmy finished and i will
let you know the result

  he left the hon john henry with his
mouth open in a vain attempt at speech
and went down the stairs to the street

they were in the library of senor
valeras house and alone the
secretary was at his office whelmed in
the inordinate duties the great disaster had
heaped on him enrique was in charge
of a provost-marshals detail policing the
stricken city and billy smith with a
wisdom beyond his years had removed
himself to other scenes

  is it because it is so soon after wini-
fred jimmy questioned

  her head moved in dreary negation she
was white and worn from the terrors she
had passed through and yet these were as
nothing now to the sweeping sense of deso-
lation that beset her

  it is not that jimmy-what difference
could it make he is dead and his tomb
is reared above him it is there i would have
him lie and for me there are no barren
conventions to be observed and yet
jimmy it is because he is dead that i must
go my way apart from you it is because
a secret is buried with him that i his daugh-

ter should be the last to tell i can not
share it with you jimmy

  but you love me you have said it
winifred

   ah if love were only all of life she
clasped her hands with a passionate gesture
in which also was the eloquence of a su-
preme despair but it is not all honor
and dishonor are in it and pride and shame
we are prisoners to them for good or bad
she moved away a few aimless steps car-
ing only that she should not see his sup-
pliant eyes he did not follow he stood
very quietly where he was and he said
your father when i parted with him
gave into my keeping a key i was to use
it in case anything happened to him the
key was to his strong-box at the credito
mercantil he said there were money and
papers there and i was to read the papers
i have read them winifred

  she had turned and was gazing at him
in incredulous surprise it was several
seconds before she spoke

  you know they were her fathers
words-the same choked cry

   he answered her as he had her father
and his smile was infinitely tender and com-
passionate

   from the first i knew it winifred i
told your father that i knew and his hand
was in mine at that last moment before he
went on a brave mans mission and met a
brave mans death

  you knew-all the time-and it made
no difference a wonderful light was in
her eyes

   did i act as if it did winifred he

asked

  he held out his arms a long moment
intervened she took a trembling step
toward him and stopped

  your-your father she whispered

   his head lifted pridefully

   my father will rejoice with me for he
too is a man

   an instant longer she hesitated and then
came all the way

the end

the greai foolishness

hij euqeneblylijjr

ome to think of it john johann
and jonathan sam were cousins
-three great big fellows-and
they might have gotten along
very well together except for the woman
but there was the woman-this woman
like a flame in the raw gold camp of placer
sands where men didnt go to law for what
they wanted but to the sagging bulge on
their hips the gaudy jade had virtue
which strangely enough was the trouble
she wouldnt let herself go easy she let
it be understood around camp that only the
best man could get her so there was that
question to be decided

  the woman was that kind she wanted
trouble tribute of trouble was wine to
her red lips she was the kind to stand
by while men fought for her men did it
too made ribbons of one another now
perhaps you begin to see her rich in sex in
animal magnificence in sheer splendor of
the flesh - a strapping stunning crea-
ture slender and lithe and lazy her
mouth was a painted cupids bow a ver-
satile cupids bow whipped by whim petu-
lant haughty cruel or melting and the
dark smoky eyes were heavy with chal-
lenge and slumberous mystery

  her name was suprema and she fitted
the name for all its crude genesis in gilt-
shaded lettering on a patent-medicine label
the word had appealed to her mothers
naive soul the word was part of the
spanish translation descriptive of the bot-
tled remedy suprema it had a gor-
geous sound irresistible as carmen and gold

enough-the babe was christened suprema
and suprema the woman was of a glamor
to match

  suprema couldnt bother jonathan sam
though-not yet not very much jona-
than sam liked to be care-free and wear a
cheerful grin under his tousled mop sam
wasnt denying that the woman went to his
head when she came around and her per-
fumery was in the air just the same she
was thirty-seven shades too resplendent in
the way of egyptian bliss for jonathan
sam hed have something more home-
folksy for his thank you and besides
what was the use old jock-that was
john though john wasnt old only big and
slow and florid with a bald spot-old jock
would get her anyway

  old jock more than shared his cousin
sams prophetic feeling that he jock would
be the one to get suprema old jock had
gotten much already because he knew or
had known how to use his fists thus it
was jock and not sam nor yet johann
who had staked off the likeliest claims in
the first rush to placer sands it was jock
who had jumped other claims who had
grabbed creek frontage right and left-and
god help the hindmost including johann

  naturally therefore concerning the
camps ravishing trouble-maker old jock
took it for granted that when he beckoned
shed come it never penetrated his re-
doubtable skull that she had begun to look
at johann that her looks were mighty
provocative too and jock neither saw
nor heard if she sighed forlorn and artful
the great foolishness



  iust for jonathan sam to hear but then
jock couldnt have felt any real hostility
toward sam anyway

  toward sam jock was more like an
older brother an overbearing bull-headed
brother and jonathan sam had riled and
swatted him for it once or twice though
without any permanent hard feelings either
way those two never really took advan-
tage of one another but without being
extra friendly either when it comes to that

  but about johann now-about the other
cousin-well old jock ought to have both-
ered thats all he certainly ought he
oughtnt to have been bull-headed and
cocksure and blind as the under edge of a
stone wall where johann figured into the
game for while jock was burly and soft
johann was burly and hard and getting
harder johann panned his own gravel in
the rapids all day even though he liked
to smoke and be sociable of an evening
and maybe get poetic about the volcano
dust in the sunset sky

  johann might have seemed warmer-
hearted and more subject to honest grief or
mirth than stiff old jock but that was only
a part of the man that johann was and
perhaps a craftily calculated part sam
guessed it-there were woman notions back
in cousin johanns blond brooding head

  the three men would scarcely have
picked the same time for one of their
periodical hikes back to cities and civiliza-
tion they certainly would have picked
one another for companions on the peril-
ous trek across desert and sierra but
the woman was going too her swarthy
wanderer father who dealt faro smiling a
fixed gleam of white teeth had himself
cashed in and the desolated daughter of
chance had smoothed smoother the tight
sash over her hips and expressed little won-
der but what shed be moving on

  lone temptresses of course did not move
on over a bone-dry wilderness so casual as
all that but it appeared directly that john
was going back to bank his gold-dust and
sam largely to blow his and she mentioned
to johann laughing low that she was going
with them so johann went also su-
prema knew then that the journey would
not be monotonous she had so provided

  there were the four of them who went
and also a boy besides pack-animals and
mounts the boy was a sturdy sober-
minded industrious waif belonging to no-

body he had a portable forge and he used
to sharpen the miners tools but the forge
was packed on his little gray burro now

  at the end of their first day of tortuous
plodding they were down among the foot-
hills and the first night they camped beside
a mountain stream the woman had a dog-
tent and quilted pads and angora rugs but
the three men and the boy bedded them-
selves under the stkrs johann sullen
and suspicious unrolled his blankets near
johns

  where they lay and before sleep might
transport them safely hence they could
hear the woman humming to herself in her 
tent it was singularly disturbing her
nearness was a palpable tiling and she was
not letting them forget it the low notes
cuddled deeper in the pillow of silence
sleep-laden dreamy dying at last one
of the men threw off his blankets and stood
up it was johann his blocked-out
figure strained toward the tent the sil-
very blur of canvas was filmy like a veil in
the soft haze

 man lie down what the -

growled old jock

  gruff old jock wanted to sleep but
something peremptory was in his growl
johann jerked back his head and his hands
hardened into great sledge-like fists at his
side but johann did not know what
weapon john might have trained on him
and he muttered a bit but subsided back
into his blankets just the same

  the next morning while john was trying
to stake his mule where it had other views
in the matter he got a kick that put his
left arm in a sling john swore it was
nothing and sympathy only made him
madder but johanns gaze lingered on the
bandaged arm with brooding earnestness

  afterward at breakfast which was spread
on a fiat rock near the creek johann kept
near the woman he was so persistent in
this that he might have been goading him-
self by each rustling movement of her body
by the fragrance of her in each breath he
drew-goading himself on to some wild and
secret project she was between him and
john indolently snipping off bits of pone
crust with her even white teeth

  after a while when it suited her mood
she let johann have the thrall of her big
round smoldering black eyes and at the
same time she let her hand that was nearest
john come to rest over johns hand then


adventure

at the quick thickening of storm between
johanns brows she lazily arched her own
as if asking him in so many words what he
was going to do about it

johanns cumbrous wits floun-
dered he was maddened past en-
durance and yet he lacked provo-
cation he had no call to attack john
who hadnt so much as noticed the womans
caress but johann tortured provocation
out of nothing he slapped at a gnat miss-
ing it and his hand was cupped to slap
again when his frown focused on stolid im-
pervious john

   you object eh johann roared thump-
ing his chest and jumping to his feet

   johann could not pass behind the woman
to get at john because of the creek and its
treacherous sands at her back so he had
to go around the camp-fire but the boy
was in his way squatted tailor-fashion by
the fire mending a broken cinch-buckle and
johann lurched over the boy and then
kicked him in the side the thud of it
turned sam sick

   the boy staggered to his feet

  you b-big bruiser the boy sobbed
swaying where he stood but with the long
rasp he had been using he belted johann
across the knuckles and hurled it at him

   even when johann swept him under foot
the boy wrapped his arms about the ankle
of johanns boot and held on

  but john-old jock himself-was there
now john had slipped his bandage and
had rushed to save the boy johns arm
was not broken as johann had hoped but
big as john was-inches bigger every way
than thick-set johann-he was soft and
clumsy and unbelievably dense john just
shut his eyes and slugged jonathan sam
could have wept for the old blunderhead
the most tremendous body wallops rained
on old jock only beat a grunt out of him

   at first johann seemed surprised and dis-
concerted because john could not realize
that he was licked then it infuriated johann
because john kept on the boy was still
clinging to johanns boot too but johann
savagely kicked himself loose ran to the
fire scooped up live coals in the frying-pan
and dashed them in johns face john
fended with one arm across his eyes blindly
groping with the other hand whereupon
johann leaped and bore him to the ground
they rolled snarling like jaguar cats

  jonathan sam gaped what had started
this anyway oh yes a gnat bite then
he saw the woman

  she was perched on a rock like some
beautiful valkyr above the obscene clamor
waiting waiting and in that she was a
harpy too though damnably beautiful
but this valkyr was not interested in the
souls of heroes nor this harpy in any mans
dead flesh rather was she the lioness
feigning unconcern

  as jonathan sam looked at her and
thence to the two giants heaving and goug-
ing he had a glimmer of horrified compre-
hension here was why johann had toiled
at the sluices johann had been laying on
muscle content to let john put on layers
of paunch sam marveled at the terrific
singleness of purpose behind johanns pa-
tient cunning he stood aghast at dull
unwieldly johann obsessed by a dream of
winning suprema and become this maniac
of swift destruction

  but sam recalled times when johann
had scowled at him too so that now sam
distrusted johanns past friendliness ev-
erything once seeming decent and loyal
about johann began to look like treacherous
calculation and only johanns scowl was
honest stufi sam saw his own turn com-
ing next sam was lean and rangy but
without training sams fists packed no
more punch than a sofa-pillow yet he
knew that he ought to pitch in or johann
would finish them off singly sam knew he
ought yet it didnt seem fair-two to one-
and he chose to stand by and let them fight
it out which was a difficult business when
they jostled and sideswiped him and mut-
tered abuse if he yelled at them to be
careful

  the boy made it hardest when sam
thought of the look on that boys face the
manhood in him cringed for shame why-
why-had he not rushed in when johann
first drew back his boot well sam had
not believed that johann could do it
the thing itself had left him dazed but if
it were to do over again  if  

  a hand was laid on his shoulder and
sam found the woman beside him with a
little nestling movement she dovetailed her
fingers of both hands over his forearm
her gaze drifted to the two men beating
each other to pulp for her then back again
up at sam and her brows arched in that
slow questioning way of hers
the great foolishness



   sam twisted his arm free

  i know that stuff you handed it to
johann he cried roughly

  she laughed his anger was score one
for her

  your chance boy-baby she mocked
and she whispered there wont maybe
never come another

   sam frowned the blacker because his pulse
leaped he understood her all right let
him now clean up johann and with john a
wreck who was there left to interest the
lady who but jonathan sam

  but he was brought out of that by a
groan that could not be quite smothered
he caught the woman by the arm

  that boy lying there go to him whats
the matter with you anyway-you a
woman dont you see hes hurt

  her smoky eyes rounded wonderingly
and sam pushed her aside and ran to the
boy with water from the creek in his
hat he bathed the boys white twitching
face and tried to wash out the jagged
gashes from the bottom of a constricted
heart jonathan sam cursed johann the
woman came and stood over him and
watched him curiously at his ministrations
as one watches the devotee of a strange cult
tenderness toward the weak was a strange
cult for suprema

  sam looked up not at her but at the
two men there had been a pause in the
struggle while john and johann lay wheez-
ing for breath each with fingers grappled
in the others shirt now they had started
again with each buckling up of the two
bodies johann always strained to throw
his weight in the direction of the creek
his purpose was clear once at the brink
he would suddenly break all holds and
thrust john over the quicksands would
finish john on they went john cran-
ing his neck to snatch a glimpse of where
they were bound once for a second
sam caught johns eye bloodshot and
desperate

  aye jock sam shouted these are
stirrous times old dear

  over they thumped again johann be-
neath  but in the instant of going over him-
self john flung out a leg dug his heel into
the ground and dropped athwart johanns
chest with his hands and his weight on
top he clamped johanns shoulders down
upon the camp-fires patch of live coals just
beneath johann ripped forth a howl and

became a frenzy of flopping and agony and
astonishment he had overlooked the
patch of live coals in his path but old
jock had not

  during an anxious moment sam hoped
that johann might now be scorched back
into decent citizenship but not for long
could john smother down the whale-like
heaving under him john was bucked off
at last and only by a split second got to
his feet first johann made for the creek
and frantically doused water over his burns
but john was coming and johann did not
wait snatching up a canteen passing the
woman on the way who met his insane
glare with a mona lisa smile johann
scrambled up the steep face of the nearest
cliff showering his pursuer under a land-
slide of rock and gravel he dropped be-
hind a ledge and gave himself over to nurs-
ing his wounds

john came back battered and
weary but with a stubborn light in
his eye among their dunnage he
found first johanns cartridge belt and pis-
tol and then his own johanns pistol he
tossed into the creek his own he aimed
and fired twice at each shot one of
johanns two pack-mules dropped as if all
four legs were cut away by a scythe

  johann came pounding down from his
refuge

  what do you mean by that he roared
what do you mean by that

  im meaning a fight said john grimly
a fair fight

  fair screeched johann you call it
fair killing my mules howll i tote grub
enough you want to starve me-thats
it-starve me

  john nodded his hard head

  yes said john thats it and while
you are starving some ill be hardening up
and that way well both work around to an
even-steven condition for the finish i sup-
pose you understand johann that its got
to go to a finish now

  but johann screeched some more about
starving and shrugged his shoulders jo-
hann neednt starve john reminded him
it was only a day back to placer sands
johann could go on back there

  at that the woman laughed and johann
looked and saw that she was looking at him
the slow smile was creeping about her lips
johann could go back and not starve but


adventure

she would not go back with him to go
back was to give her up johann turned
again on him

  ill whip you now he yelled coming
at john iu whip you on a full stomach

  johns overstrained tendons jerked his
knees as he tried to get set

  all right-waiting for you he said

  game old rooster sam murmured af-
fectionately

  that he was not soon a gone one was due
to no lack of deadly purpose in johanns
seething ferocity but johanns knuckles
were raw from the boys rasp and the great
driving muscles down his back were drawn
and stiffening from his bums each smash-
ing blow he dealt cost him a fiercer wrench
of pain only his maniacal fury kept him
at it and at that he twisted his slobbered
mouth into frightful grimaces with some
desperate fee-faw-fum notion of scaring
john into a blue funk but john went right
on wildly pummeling and talcing what
came

  in the end-for theres no need to cata-
log the buffets of the exhausted giants-
they were half-kneeling half-crouching on
the ground each holding the other off
thus they glared eye to eye out of puffed
lids their huge arched chests laboring until
they fell apart they lay as they fell eyes
distended and wary

  the woman sighed and shrugged her
shoulders and went back to her tent

  the little caravan did not continue its
journey that day jonathan sam did not
reflect that he might perhaps have gone on
alone with suprema instead he would
wait for his cousins until they could travel
and he would not leave the boy of the
woman suprema he was not observably
thinking at all she was both indignant
and puzzled she couldnt figure him out
what was it they called it in the vegetable
world when some cabbage or other jumped
the reservation oh yes-a sport well
jonathan sam was a sport-that kind
yes and he was a vegetable too

  but sam knew the perils to the lone
traveler in the arid waste they had yet to
cross they would all need each other
badly too sam cursed johann again when
he thought of the desert he almost cursed
the woman it was up to him to stay sane
to get them all safely across

  they stayed where they were that day
and that night john slept with his pistol

under his hand his stuff about him his
horse and mule staked near and he tried to
sleep with one bad eye half-open but
when he awoke at dawn he perceived jo-
hann loading a gray burro

  thats my jack cried the boy and
he stole my grub-sack too

  look here jo said sam the childs
got to eat

  is that so retorted johann

  he cant walk either said sam the
way you beat him up

  serves him right the meddling brat
sneered johann

  john aimed his pistol

  sorry lad said john but he fired
and dropped the gray burro dead sorry
he repeated but johann had to be licked
which was the sole issue and consideration
with john

  quit your worrying kid said sam
ive got plenty

  which was true with his usual luck
sam had six burros besides his saddle-mule
the burros had been left on his hands by
two prospectors whom he had grub-
staked

  let you ride the mule too sam added
meant to hoof it anyway its time- he
glanced at johann striding toward them-
high time i was hardening up some tam-

bien

  johanns manner when he came was a sur-
prise for there was an ingratiating smile
upon his discolored lips

  like to earn some dust sammy he
asked

  sam nodded

  always he said

  then see here suppose you distribute
my stuff around on these jacks of yours
id-id pay you pay you right now
sammy

  sam pondered

  all right he said four ounces per
day per hundred but jo-youll have
to deliver the freight

  thats all right said johann ill
go get it

  johann ran to the dead burro and swung
its pack to his own shoulder but he was
not half-way back when john put a bullet
between his feet

  ill line out the next one higher said
john

  johann dropped the pack and shook his
fist yelling
the great foolishness



  sams got something to say about that
sam knows hes got a right to freight

goods-

  hold on sam interrupted i dont see
any to freight

  isnt this here any   demanded
johann

  not unless you deliver it

  and let that claim-jumper pot me
johann raged

  thats not my affair said sam if
it was you with the pistol you could see
that for yourself

  johanns ingratiating smile was entirely
gone now

  huh i get you he sneered bitterly
i get you-youre in with john youre
in with him or scared of him

  deliver the freight and ill pack it
repeated sam but dont expect me to
take johns gun away from him

  all right said johann all right but
wait-thats all-wait-and remember
he spat to underscore his threat and
wiped his hand across his mouth then
he dragged back the pack and sorted out
what he would carry and burned what he
must leave behind the latter included
much that he had stolen from the boy

  with the heat of the day they were out
of the foothills and halted beside the last
pool of the dwindling stream from which it
was possible to dip water beyond lay a
sage-pocked waste rimmed by a copper
horizon they rested here till night filling
canteens water-skins and sams six empty
kegs but an hour after sundown found
them moving through a luminous haze like
lavender and stardust in solution threading
their course among endless purpled clumps
of brush and yucca

  the woman rode in the lead she was
mounted palfrey-fashion on a tireless little
mustang behind her plodded her string
of pack-horses burdened mostly with the
regalia accessory to her lure she was
humming her song again and especially
was it like a sirens song as the men followed
her into the trackless wilderness often
she looked back at first hopefully then in
haughty petulance the first of the men
was jonathan sam sam leaned against
his mule as he walked so as to hold the
sick boy in the saddle sam might have
been walking beside suprema of course
undeniably she was at sea regarding
sam

behind sams outfit came johns
saddle-horse and pack-mule and
after them trudged big john him-
self at times john rode but according as
his big soft bruised body would let him
resolutely he walked old jock was in
training now using his pistol for menace
he jealously guarded the distance between
his mule with its precious burden of food and
water and the bent solitary figure of johann

  all that johann had of food he carried on
his back and a bulging water-skin atop of
that even so johann carried other weight
which was neither food nor drink strung
to his belt hung small canvas sacks round
and tight as cannon-balls and as heavy
nuggets and dust were in them his clean-up
at placer sands the sacks swayed gently
touching then one slipped its thong
and dropped but johann checked an
impulse to kneel and salvage the scattered
dust already he knew that in time he
must jettison all the gold

  he fingered the hasp of a hunting-knife
in its sheath imperceptibly he lengthened
his stride bringing him slowly nearer to the
moving shadow there ahead which was
johns mule

  when the first rays streaked the east and
the mystery of stardust and lavender had
changed to a gray desolation john stopped
to fill his canteen from the water-skin on
his mule but the tumorous-like bag had
gone flat during the night through a slit
in the hide the water had drained a
hunting-knife-johanns-lay between two
grub-sacks beneath the collapsed water-
skin without a word john hurled himself
on johann

  johann went down but parrying with
one arm he slipped off his pack-straps and
labored to his feet although johns ter-
rific punches lacked steam it was apparent
that the first margin of difference between
the two adversaries had narrowed

  sam hurrying back to them stopped short
to stare at something else-something half-
hidden behind a cactus-a dirty grayish
head with pointed ears and lolling red
tongue the beasts eyes intent and
cunning were on the weakening combat-
ants sam had a feeling that other gray
forms infested the sage and at a sound
behind him he clapped his hand to his pis-
tol but it was only the woman who had
ridden up behind him and was quietly
laughing at him


adventure

  i see said sam getting mad you
arent scared of wolves then

  dear me no she laughed its up
to you-the three of you-to save me from
them isnt it

  and a job for the three of us at that
sam retorted but look at em-the
comedians they think theyre fighting
for you they havent the sense to see
theyre fighting to give you to the wolves
you certainly ought to feel right compli-
mented maam

  the warriors had milled the alkali sand
ankle-deep and grappled weakly it was
another deadlock they stumbled apart
water gasped john water-sam
sam slung off his canteen but instantly
johann twisted a bleeding fist under his
nose

  dont you sam johann protested
without water this big bruiser is licked
and you keep clear sam you keep out
but im selling it argued sam how
about it jock im here to sell water at
one ounce of dust per one pint of water

  john nodded and took the canteen -

the price

  all right then said johann thats
all right but providing you sell me grub
too when i need it

  sure said sam come to me when you
need grub and ill sell it

  yes mumbled big john but hell not
come to you sam when he tries it ill
wing him

  johann scowled from one to another
eh-heh he burst forth with vehement
blasphemy i knew it more of your
rotten fairness the dirty two of you are
in cahoots to murder me

  but sam protested

  this here shop he said is open to
all comers but youve got to be a comer
if some hombre with a gun keeps another
hombre from coming thats not my fault
eh-heh eh-heh said johann mouth-
ing threats with his oaths as he got back
into the galling harness of his pack

  when again they stopped johanns pack
looked somewhat smaller not to be left
behind not to let the woman pass on for-
ever and to hoard his present strength
against his rival johann had begun to
throw over his future sustenance

  but john for his part was likewise be-
ginning to pay that same night john
could not drag his horse to its feet at no

price would sam risk depleting his own
store of water for johns horse and mule
the mule must soon be abandoned too
since the next water-hole was yet five
marches distant they had not gone far
when behind them they heard the wolves
snapping and yelping about the horse that
could not rise

   five nights later they still had not reached
the water-hole now the morning after
although the sun was high and the heat
waves like the breath of a furnace they
were pushing on in stricken haste all of
them except johann the gaunt figure of
emaciation that johann had become was
no longer numbered among them

  his tracks said john pointing th-
they-

  sam nodded when he opened his
mouth the air burned it dry already
johns tongue was getting black except
the boy they all labored on foot under a
pack now even the luxurious suprema
the boy drooped over the saddle-horn of
sams mule and sams mule was the only
animal left

  the tracks they followed were of one
who went heavily whose feet dragged
yet the tracks ran mostly straight or if
they weaved from the line they quickly
straightened out again the pursuers could
not cease to marvel at the indomitable will
of the man

   he was the first to fall last night per-
sisted john

  latterly they had been making camp
where the first among them fell last
night it had been johann but this morning
when they awoke they had found him gone
greater than fatigue an insensate purpose
drove the man

i tell you cried sam he wants to get
there first to fill his water-skin you mightnt
let him you with your gun what else
john touched his tongue to his fiery lips
then what are we hiking after him like

- for

god jock he wouldnt he wouldnt
wouldnt sam if you dont know the

skut yet-

  but hed need dynamite-giant-powder
he couldnt wreck that water-hole unless he
had-

   yes he could if hes got plenty of time

just with rocks he could-

  hurry then we havent a full canteen
left take the girls other arm she-
the great foolishness



  she was about all in as to that but
note that jonathan sam thought of her now
as the girl not as the woman the change
dated from about the time she began leav-
ing off her perfumery her regalia was
back there too strapped to the skeletons
of her pack-horses long since picked clean
by the wolves suprema the opulent and
barbaric had come down in the world along
with those who would win her and she
had left off the animal lure as well it had
sam backed to the guards

  i declare sue he burst out after deep
pondering i dont get you at all any
more

  surprise as much as a hummock of dust
made her stumble half-jeeringly he had
used to call her miss supremacy now it
was sue moreover she liked sue
better and she wouldnt have before

  how sam in what way her tone
was eager

  how in thunder should i know but
you seem-well somehow-cleaner

      at the word the crimson swept
into her burned cheeks but a
swift glanced showed her that he
was entirely serious cleaner well it
did sound like a joke when she looked down
at herself-a disheveled thing in grimy
khaki blouse and skirt who plowed along
somehow in a cloud of whitish-yellow dust

  she thought of scented baths of the lost
softness of her skin the one-time rounded
fulness of her slender body the clinging
enticements of gossamer weave and but-
terfly tints and the sensuous ease of her
blood lazily coursing and now jonathan
thought her    she laughed and it was
a queer kind of laugh but that was be-
cause she had his meaning which was more
than sam did himself

  sam she said and hesitated any-
way sam i hope you are right i-i hope
i am

  he started at the yearning in her voice

  but his mule had stopped stiff-kneed in
its tracks head down body gently weaving
as sam reached for the boy in the saddle
the mules forelocks curled backward and
it was down-finished

  more of the same sounded johns
cavernous rumble lump o rock already
in sight too

  sam grimly waved john on his trained
eye had also marked where the slate-green

of the yucca trees was possibly a little higher
and a little thicker-meager promise of an
oasis and water

  john nodded and stalked on alone
johann would be at the water-hole already
-had been there perhaps with time enough
to do the thing they feared

  sam ran overtook john and gave him
his canteen

  all jock drink it all get there
quicker-go

  john tilted the canteen to his lips but
did not stop sam turned back to suprema
and the boy behind them in among the
sage he saw ghostly gray scavengers sniff-
ing toward the fallen mule but there
would be no more carcasses to stay them
that is unless 

  sams lean face was hard and drawn as
he hastened back he steadied the boy
and would have helped suprema as before
but she shook her head impatiently and
put herself on the boys other side to help
with him her act in doing this brought
back sams perplexity

  whats this new stuff of yours anyway
sue he demanded have you gotten
human or what

  i dont know sam what it is she said
she was as helpless in her own bewilder-
ment about it as a child

  there was a silence as they fared on in
the torrid glare

  after all sam she began again with a
strange shyness upon her after all its
only fifty-fifty you had me bothered too
sam oh but not any more no because
i got it at last

  it-what

  of course she said your being out
for yourself-that was perfectly intelligible
to me its what makes all of you as legible
as-as the one on a dollar bill

  out for himself when sam thought
what he had charged poor old jock for
water for freight for riding a donkey he
blushed to the back of his neck he had
jocks dust to the last sack now safely
cached with his own beside the trail he
had back his treasury stock which canny
old jock had once bought of him he held
as security a block of shares in jocks own
claims for now it was jock who owed him
and not he jock these transactions had
been most gratifying

  yes suprema went on rather drearily
your selling water at ten times its weight


adventure

in gold was quite comprehensible but your
giving it away giving it to the boy-jona-
than sam that had me stumped for fair
sams grit-laden brows knitted he re-
membered surprising her puzzled eyes on him
as if he were a bug or a celebrity usually
it had been when he was doing something
for the boy and not thinking of her at all

  i dont suppose she said in a faintly
rueful tone of reproach you ever did get
a girl so pestered or ever will again you
certainly were one continuing riddle sam
riddle eh well whats the answer
the answer why she cried it was
that simple i couldnt see it it was only
that maybe you werent out entirely for
yourself after all sam it was something
so clean stark staggering new to me that-

that-

  wait

  under the merciless ball of fire hung in
the sky the boy had gently sighed and gone
limp between them with a swift back-
ward glance for wolves sam lifted the frail
bundle across his shoulder and kept on
the womans eyes slowly filled but they
were not puzzled not any more he looked
down at her yes she was crying

  strength he heard her saying
strength like a bitter refrain how i
have worshipped it-just strength-always
-and i never knew what it really was
and when i did understand-sam sam it
was too-too gorgeous for me all at once
and then-god knows im not mushy
sam and mores the pity but-well it
choked me up and-and you can call it
new stuff if-if you must jonathan sam
he was filled with sheer wonderment

  i reckon he said youll have to try
to forgive me sue lord help me how
was i to know youd change so

  changed she cried she brushed back
flying ends of hair to look at him you
think so sam oh maybe its true then
maybe-maybe ill make the shore yet
if any of us do sue

  you mean the-wolves if the wolves
dont stop us dont ou

  the wolves yes but there was johann
first in his minds eye sam saw again a
thin ribbon of water trickling down the face
of a rock slowly filling a shallow basin of
stone he imagined some haggard desert-
rat crawling to that thread of life but to
find the basin shattered the seam of the
rock a gaping fissure and the flow rising

no higher than the sand and now a maniac
in his despair and his hatred of his fellow-
beings was at that shrine of existence-
there alone frenzied resourceful there
alone unless old jock reached him in
time

  make it or perish make it or perish
sams heart beat the taps

  but just because of the lengthening odds
sams zest for the dizzy gamble of life was
whetted to a keener edge his crushing
burden pain and the torture of effort-
none of it could down the eternal buoyancy
of gay adventure in jonathan sam

  in the arid endless grove of sage lump
o rock grew well defined at last a craggy
dorsal reef in a drab dead scum-strewn
sargasso sea a mountain had thrust its
peak through the sand to become one more
synonym in the vocabulary of hope

  they were close to it so close that to
sams vigilant ears came the crackle of
twigs tramped under foot of the cause
however he saw nothing a chute ran up
into the rock cactus and desert-grass were
thick on it and behind the tangled fringe
some sort of struggle was going on

  sam dropped off his pack and carrying
the boy labored on the girl fell behind-
vaguely he knew that she stumbled with
head down he fought the undertow of sand
between him and the rock he heard stac-
cato gasps and his thought was that even
yet he might be in time when-not in front
but back of him-a shriek of terror jerked
taut every nerve in him

he whirled pistol drawn una-
ware that he had let the boy slip to
the ground he beheld suprema
running toward him her arms raised close
beside her a wolf ran leaping at her throat
snapping its jaws farther back sniffing
and cautious but huddling for the rush
crouched the dirty-gray pack of wolves
the hem of the girls dress caught on a
broken stalk of cactus dragging it she
went down on one knee her arms as she
fell she hel d outstretched toward sam there
was an instant when the animals forepaws
were on her skirt when also sam fired in
air the pack broke scattering vanish-
ing among the sage their leader last

  the girls right sleeve hung in ribbons
from the shoulder and her white arm
passed round the mans neck as he stooped
and swept her to her feet and held her
the great foolishness



  you are my girl he said my girl-
do you hear

  her arm tightened about his neck

  sam it was you from the first she in-
formed him but i could not make you
so much as try to get me-you-the strong-
est and dearest

  the strongest he echoed in scorn
hm just so

  his scorn was for himself because he
alone could not bring her safely through
he needed big john he might do without
johann but he did need big john or su-
prema and all of them would go down be-
fore the wolves which was reason enough
why john and johanns glorious orgy of
mayhem should come to an end

  but they were still at it john and jo-
hann sam had forgotten the girls
peril had made him forget but this was
her peril too he put an arm about her
and together they lurched and buffeted
through the sand toward the water-hole

  this time no sound rose from behind the
matted growth no trampling of brush nor
hard-drawn gasps the stillness was omi-
nous and ghostly they found the gap
a threshold packed hard by the converging
tracks of desert prowlers the half-shaded
place into which they stumbled was as still
as a church but they did not think of that
water was all their thought on the first
mouthful to burning membranes their souls
were centered their gaze sought the face
of the rock at the end of the chute there
they should see a tiny pool in a basin of
stone then realization petrified them in
their tracks they remembered johann
johann had been there

  of him they saw nothing nor of john
but of johanns handiwork there was that
which figured death-their own the face
of the rock for a height of two feet and as
wide was broken down the debris filling
the hollowed stone at the base johann
must have had dynamite and yet the
hole in the rock did not look like a shot
on his knees groping for a trace of moist-
ure that might betray the rocks severed
artery sam threw out first a cold chisel
and then a farriers hammer now where
on the desert had johann picked up a cold
chisel and a farriers hammer sam recog-
nized them they had belonged to the
boy johann had found them in the boys
kit had foreseen his need of them here
food and gold johann had cast away but

tools for cutting the life-thread of his fel-
low creatures were more precious to him
sam brought his hand out dry and looked
up at the girl now that they knew the
end a warping grin twisted his mouth

  he wondered though at the way her
eyes widened he wondered what she was
staring at suddenly he thought he under-
stood for he thought she was going mad
well maybe it was better better for her
poor kid one arm she held partly raised
extended downward the hand quivered
from the wrist like a leaf yet he knew she
was pointing pointing down at him her
lips cracked and flecked with dried blood
were parted and her slack jaw trembled
suddenly-

  water she screamed and slued over
upon him in a heap

  he gathered her to him with a bitter and
defiant tenderness but gradually he be-
came aware that her mouth was pressed
against his shoulder that it was held there
and when he felt a fold of the cloth drawn
between her teeth in a kind of pitying hor-
ror he forced back her head then he
too stared her lips were wet-freshly
wet he frowned deeply with angry
concentration he must not hope-it was
too dangerous but why were her lips wet
like that he put his hand to his shoulder
the cloth was wet too cool and wet so it
was not perspiration but what had made
it wet what had he been doing to make
it wet well he had been groping in the
rock he did it again and noted that the
point of his shoulder was jammed against
the upper edge of the little cave

  god he murmured god grant--

  and daring all he laid the palm of his
hand on the rock where his shoulder had
pressed at once moisture gathered be-
tween his fingers he removed his hand
a narrow ribbon of water so thin that it
was scarcely a film coursed down the face
of the rock at the edge of the rock it
fell drop by drop so after all the mur-
derous beast johann had not tunneled in
deep enough to cut the fine ascending
thread johann had again clumsily mis-
calculated

  sue he whispered its all right

  he plunged his hand into the debris
the fragments of rock were flooded the
stone basin was intact they had only
to clean out the basin and wait while the
drops fell one by one


adventure

  but why wait let them find johanns
water-skin and canteen which naturally
johann must have filled before beginning
his labor of destruction

 canteen and water-skin and both
filled they did find after a little search
within the fringe of brush but at that spot
they stood and gazed down on johann and
john lying there-yes and also the boy

  the three still forms lying there were un-
speakably horrid because they were human
had they been stuffed lay figures for the
setting of a desert picture they would have
been only grotesque as it was they were
too grotesquely hideous for reality they
were too wildly disordered too shrunken of
flesh and protuberant of bone the coatingof
alkali dust was too spectral the caked fes-
tered wounds were too natural-as a wax-
works horror they overreached but they
were not wax they were john and
johann and the boy and it was the finish of
the fight

  the finish-but to associate the idea of
victory and a victor with it was but a grisly
straining for humor johann was lying on
his back his gaunt face was upturned
his tongue was bloated between his parted

teeth and half-across his chest lay john
face downward fingers of one hand curled
as they had slipped from johanns throat
the boy had had johann by an ankle at the
last he lay so now

  sams features hardened into a grimace

  johns fight he announced

  two pointed ears vanished behind a rock
at his muttered words and they heard
the startled wolf making off through the
brush

  wait and youll get us all you fellows
said sam

  an exclamation from the girl brought
him round she was kneeling beside the
boy she motioned excitedly pointing to
johanns canteen sam snatched it up and
ran to her

  his heart-feel maybe the others-

  it was true the boys heart fluttered
under the pressure of finger-tips and it
was true of the others sam and the girl
set about to revive them they-all of
them-might now win through they had
food enough and water-and together
theyd match the desert and the wolves

  but therell be no more fighting de-
clared jonathan sam

a complete novelette

y wtowrtpnd

author of mr harringtons wife a leader of men etc

k jht was a dark february morning
i rain fell steadily and without
 sji pity men with sheepskin coats
me over their wet khaki waded
knee-deep through flooded trenches on
every side there was misery discomfort and
the chance of death and yet the boy grinned

grinned boyishly and cheerfully as if at last
he had reached happiness that in itself
was enough to make flint curious

  he was tall and slight built on the lines of
a young grayhound straight-backed and as
tough as whipcord he had fair hair gray
eyes that met flints gaze steadily with no
the other side



sign of nervousness a thin freckled face
with a touch of color still showing in the
cheeks a short straight nose and a firm
mouth that was forever breaking into a
smile and his smile seemed to be trying to
explain that though very young and insig-
nificant and unworthy he wanted to make
friends and learn his job whatever that job
might be and please everybody

   he looked in fact exactly what he was a
boy who in other times would have been
thinking of nothing more important than
football or next seasons cricket or the
varsity in the autumn certainly not of war
or shell-fire or the necessity of leading into
action men older than himself

  but there was something about him
something reliable and straightforward and
altogether efficient that made flint glad
that he was to have the boy in d company

  are you captain flint sir he had
asked i was told at the q m stores i
was posted to you is that all right sir
flint who had been making his way slowly
and with difficulty along a wet and badly
battered communication trench leading
from the front line halted and steadied him-
self on a half-fioating duck board

  let me see youre-

   im derrick said the boy smiling

  oh i understand now flint thrust
out his hand im glad to see you rot-
ten weather isnt it

   beastly

  why didnt you wait till tonight and
come up with the ration party

  i dont know sir i thought-well i
thought now id got here id better join the
battalion at once there was nothing much
for me to do in sailly anyhow

   a miracle said flint with a half-smile
a miracle so he comes here-to this
thinking hell find jobs and things and the
war waiting to begin i am even more
glad to have you than i said i was

  the boy reddened and then laughed

   it wasnt that sir really but-

   but flint stopped him

  you come along with me and ill show
you the underground palace known as d
company headquarters and dont you
be ashamed because youre keen son i
like em keen were in the supports at
present back a bit but we go into the front
line tomorrow

   have you had a bad time of it lately
sir

   fairly hellish said flint quietly its
a rotten sector of course

  what kind of a crowd have you got
opposite

  a particularly poisonous brand of prus-
sian -them

  flint spoke as one who had suffered yet
bears no bitterness

  hope theyll not celebrate my arrival
anyway said the boy

flint rendered critical by sixteen
months of actual fighting was
pleased to become possessed of a
subaltern of the new army who was not only
keen-that in itself was a common virtue-
but who knew his job savored of the mir-
aculous flint himself a second-lieutenant
of three years service at the outbreak of war
and now a captain and in command of a
company had all the regular officers in-
stinctive distrust of those who had obtained
commissions merely because their country
was at war and needed officers

  to his mind no one could hope to make
an officer much less an efficient officer un-
less he had had his eighteen months at
sandhurst followed by the long and gradual
breaking in with a regular battalion nor
could he hope to learn the ways of the army
its traditions and customs the duties and
obligations of an officer after serving for a
matter of months only it was impossible
on the face of it more often than not
flints strictures were justified

  but derrick was of a different type
here as flint soon discovered was effi-
ciency in the highest degree eagerness to do
not only his own work but the work of
others as well an eagerness that flint
curbed most promptly enthusiasm and an
instinctive understanding of his men com-
bined with sympathy and tact and a sense
of humor that was priceless at such a time
and in such a place

  flint while purposely sparing in his
praises announced after two days observa-
tion that he had in derrick the best sub-
altern in the battalion

   or if hes not the best at present he
said he will be soon he cant help it
hes got it in him and thats everything
another of flints finds said some one
wait till he realizes what the wars like
flint wait till hes lieen shelled to blazesl
wait till he goes over the top why not
try him flint take him out on patrol


adventure

   i will said flint im going to take
him out tonight to have a look at the huns
new wire

  and as flint had promised so it was
that night he took the boy out between
the lines

   it was cold and very dark the rain had
ceased at intervals stars showed between
the gaps in the driven clouds and the wind
moaned shrilly through the barbed wire
across no mans land

   there was little shelling but occasionally
bursts of machine-gun fire from the german
trenches swept the open ground between
the lines

   flint and the boy crept slowly along the
outskirts of the maze of german wire every
now and then lying motionless in the mud
as the star-shells hissed upward

   once flint heard a little choking noise
and glancing back had a momentary glimpse
as the light waned of the boys face white
and drawn as he stared into the ghastly
wide opened eyes of a dead highlander
hanging from the wire but almost im-
mediately another star-shell showed him
to all appearance unmoved gazing toward
the german trenches and flint knew that
he need have no fear

   a little later the boy gripped him by the
elbow and they crouched down and waited
while four big germans passed them with
slow and stealthy tread

   when at last they reached the friendly
shelter of a small wet dug-out that smelt of
rats and stale food and damp trench-coats
and a sleepy batman had set two mugs of
hot coco on the rough plank table flint

turned to the boy-

   well kid how dvou like it

   oh all right sir i wondered whether
i ought to have put a bullet through the last
of those four huns though

  -good job for you-and me-that

you didnt said flint lightly	f

  the clumsy blighter only just missed
treading on me i suppose theyve a gap
in their wire just about where we were lying

i wonder if their trenches are anything like
as mucky as ours

   flint smiled

  maybe youll have a chance of com-
paring them kid before youre very much
older

  hope so at any rate said the boy
if i dont ill- he broke off with a
laugh its rather good sport really that

kind of exploring isnt it you never
know what youre going to run up against
dead men listening posts patrols any-
thing and the way in which he spoke
showed that he was in earnest

  good lord said flint helplessly
what a god-forsaken idea of sport
werent you scared at all flint a be-
liever in straightforward questions watched
him curiously

  scared said the boy no

  not even when you saw that poor devil
on their wire

  no sir i dont think i was he
hesitated as if trying to remember his own
feelings i didnt like it of course

  im glad youre with us said flint
youve brought us luck

  me sir how

  the surprise in the boys face was very
real

weve scarcely had a shell over since
you arrived and thats something to be
thankful for these days i can tell you
did they strafe much before then
flint stood up and began to button up his
coat

  strafei rather from mornin to night
and theyll do it again too you wait and
see but they dont get much change
out of our fellows i tell you kid theyre
great-absolutely and the sooner you
learn it the more use youll be to the
battalion well i must be off now im
going to have a look at that new sap theyre
digging youd better turn in while youve
the chance

some hours later in the middle of the
forenoon flint engaged in earnest conver-
tion with an artillery officer came upon
errick seated on the firestep poring over a
trench map

  ah there he is look garnett mild-
looking youth aint he you wouldnt
think to see him now what a fire-eater he
was hes only got one ambition and
thats killing huns thats why they let
him come out dont be afraid of him
garnett shake hands and be friendly
pleased to meet you said the gunner
is flint working you to death he al-
ways does you know no subaltern can
stand him for very long

  flint chuckled

  lord work him to death hes our
miracle works for the fun of the thing
the kid knows about as much as all the rest
the other side



of us put together already you ought to
hear him talk about the use and misuse of
artillery in trench warfare hed make
even you sit up garnett tell him all
about those guns of yours and youll both
be happy

  are you interested in artillery work
said the gunner

  yes sir-i am

  like to come and have a look round the
battery some day

  i would-very much

  well you trot along next week when
youre out of the trenches and ill show
you a thing or two thatll surprise you
weve got some new gun positions that
poor old fritz is breaking his heart over
hes been trying for two weeks to find em
and he hasnt spotted us yet

  the boys face lit up

  ill come just as soon as i get a chance
ive never seen a battery in action except
in the distance of course its awfully
good of you to ask me sir it is really
flint watched him solemnly then he
laughed an enthusiast himself neverthe-
less he found enthusiasm in others a trifle
bewildering

  derrick he said i often wonder
what on earth youd have done if there
hadnt been a war on dont you ever
think of anything besides soldiering

in the front room of the small

       headquarters and officers mess flint
was writing letters home and listening
rather against his wish to the snatches of
talk from three of his subalterns

  the room itself long and narrow and lit
by candles was furnished with a big table
from which the remains of dinner coffee
cups and glasses a plate of apples and a tin
box of plain chocolate had not yet been re-
moved a tall and hideous dresser covered
with crockery and burnished pots and pans
of copper and a mahogany chest of drawers
on the top of which were books a stuffed
partridge in a glass case and a couple of 
shell cases the walls from which the
paper was peeling in large damp patches
were adorned with vividly colored battle
pictures from the illustrated papers a mul-
titude of photographs some single por-
traits and others wedding groups framed
certificates relating to the army and di-
plomas from school granted to one elise

  seated around the little coffin-and-urn-
shaped stove were the three subalterns
smoking and talking and laughing

  nine struck from the clock over the
mantel-piece

  where on earths the kid got to

  flint looked up from the far end of the
big table at which he sat

  chuck me a cigaret some one please
who derrick he ought to be back by
now hes had time enough to inspect
twenty batteries

  the kids a good chap of course but hes
crazy all the same

   flint lit his cigaret

  i tell you what it is young stratton if
you knew one-half what the kid does youd
be just about ten times as much use as
you are at present

  stratton laughed easily

  cant help it im afraid and we
arent all built the same way anyhow

  i dont know why said flint but
theres something about the kid that you
cant help liking hes so everlastingly
keen for one thing ever heard him ask
questions he wants to know everything
how and why and when you darent
laugh at him either

  from the eastward there came the dull
throb and rumble of heavy guns

  listen to that said flint theres
the devil of a strafen going on eh theyve
been giving our trenches hell ever since
we came out to rest

  there was the sound of footsteps outside
and the murmur of voices then the door
opened and derrick entered the room wet
and smiling

  hullo said flint where the blazes
have you been what kept you theyve
got some dinner hot for you in the kitchen
does smith know that youre back

  ive had a top-hole time of it said the
boy seen everything his white teeth
showed in a sudden triumphant grin
everything and i dont want anything
to eat thanks im not hungry
maniac said stratton and hes
walked about twenty miles

  i havent either came back most of
the way on a limber wagon too they
were shelling the cross-roads like one oclock
and the driver had the wind up

  he tossed his soft cap on to a chair
smoothed back his fair hair and wriggled
out of his wet trench coat
io

adventure

  by jove its been great simply great
those gunners of ours are wonderful
hullo smith im not hungry but you
may leave it if you like smith flints
batman a stolid square-jawed private had
entered with a plate of roast beef and vege-
tables talk about being efficient the
boy went on quickly as though unwilling to
let the attention of his audience wander
i tell you we arent in it the infantrys

all right of course but-

  flint stabbed viciously at the blotting
paper with his pen

  shut up he growled look here
kid if you go on to say youd rather have
been in the artillery ill choke you under-
stand youre in the infantry and dont
you forget it

  and although he smiled flint of a sudden
felt a curious irritation come over him the
reason for which he could not have ex-
plained that any one above all any one
in his battalion should compare the artillery
with the infantry with all their hardships
and sufferings seemed almost sacrilege
for to flint who had seen his own battalion
wiped out three times over since that sun-
day when they had gone into action at
mons the infantry represented the finest
branch of the service the backbone of the
british army which had been sacrificed to
save europe from destruction

  he watched the four subalterns curiously
as they chatted and laughed around the
fire stratton small and light-hearted and
restless a student of la vie parisienne a
creature of impulse never serious even
when most in earnest mason a west-
countryman slow-moving ponderous of
thought and sound as the granite of ex-
moor macdermott a big raw-boned
irishman much older than any of the others
a silent man who spoke seldom and then
never about himself or his past and derrick
tall and slight and wholesome-looking
thoroughbred to the tips of his fingers
the youngest and the most reliable of
the four

and as flint sat at the table staring
idly across at the stove he wondered
rather sadly what the future might
hold in store for each of them flints
creed was simple unorthodox perhaps but
of a high standard that it was out-of-
date according to modern ideas he himself
acknowledged rather proudly than other-

wise briefly to his mind it were better by
far to be killed or to suffer untold torments
in battle to be maimed or disfigured to lose
sight or limbs fighting for ones country
than to live out ones life in selfish peace and
luxury and safety without having risked
anything

  few of those who had landed with him
in the summer of  were still alive
they had died at mons at ypres at given-
chy at festubert at loos it was the best
who were taken-always would any of
those in the small farmhouse last the war
through would they see the summer
green of the poplars along the roadside
or the poppies and cornflowers at the back
of the trenches or hear the larks song
in a lull of the guns or watch the brown-
and-gold leaves falling in the autumn

  and though of a practftal nature and by
no means given to sentiment flint shivered
the best were always taken of course it
was hard but it was war

  brvhi im cold some one tramp-
ing in the mud over my grave i suppose

- him thank the lord theres no

working party and we can spend our last
evening under cover eat something kid
you wont get another decent meal for more
than two weeks so youd better make the
most of your opportunity now

  there was a light knock at the door and
a plump thick-set frenchwoman with dark
hair and a worn weather-beaten face came
in

  stratton waved a friendly hand

  hullo madame how goes it com-
ment allez vous qe soir  bon eh

  the french of the british subaltern is
though limited expressive

  but there was no response no voluble out-
burst of mixed patois and soldiers english
as was customary with madame and a
strange and uncomfortable silence settled
on the little room the five officers stared
at the frenchwoman without speaking
only the clock on the mantel-piece ticked
on hurriedly as though bent on catching up
what was gone forever and the roll of guns
sounded angrily through the storm

  for madame was crying she was no
beauty at any time was madame hard work
and worry and the raising of many children
had robbed her of what looks and figure she
might have had in the far-off days of her
girlhood when monsieur had led her to the
altar her eyes were red and the lids
the other side



swollen great tears trickled down her
mottled cheeks her lips quivered and her
bosom heaved with sobs

  good god said flint jumping to his

feet madame quest-qe que votis-it

you fellows whats the word-cant some
one stop her

  macdermott gave a shrug of his big
shoulders

  poor creature leave her alone flint
if you let a woman have her cry out-so
ive heard-shell be the better for it

  i knew a girl once said stratton and
broke off abruptly very red in the face

  madame said flint desperately dis-
toi done-tell us whats wrong pour quo i
sles-vous si triste

  and then between great bursts of sobbing
madame told her story

for the country-he is dead in bataille-
monfilsl keel you say it my son pierre
lord said mason what rotten luck

-this war anyhow -it

  the frenchwoman continued in a low
broken voice weeping quietly standing
quite still in the center of the room her
fingers twisting in and out of her apron
her son pierre was dead at verdun one
had brought her the news that evening from
pierres wife at bethune they had been
married a year and pierre was dead and
the baby not a month old whom pierre
would never see and now-with pierre-
all were dead

  her husband had died first at the marne
and then three sons such good boys
and now pierre at verdun the best also
her daughters husband all dead-each
one of them what was left for her
nothing only death the good god might
take her whenever it pleased him she
would pray that her time might not be long
she was alone now all alone in the world
and once she had been happy it was the
war-the war that was wrong and cruel and
wicked-that had robbed her

they did their best to comfort her
but what comfort was there in
words when she had lost all that
made life possible

  a lump came to flints throat

  but what would you madame cest la
guerre your son died for his country
he gave his life for france

  and strange though it seemed flints
few halting sentences brought comfort

of a sudden madame drew herself up
proudly to her full height her sobs ceased
her hands dropped once more to her sides
and she gazed about her nervously as
though afraid lest she had offended
pardon messieurs she said

  her dark eyes rested with a tender wist-
ful expression on derrick

  pauvre petitl she said softly and from
the way she spoke she might have been
talking to one of her own boys-perhaps in
her own mind she was so young-and
your mother the poor mothers

  as though it were the most natural thing
to do without showing any trace of em-
barrassment she put her hands on the boys
shoulders and kissed him tenderly on either
cheek then she went out crying softly
into her apron feeling her way with her out-
stretched hand flint closed the door

  the boys face was very red and he turned
and walked over to the stove

  well said flint grimly

  well said macdermott what of it

thats your-war for you four sons-

dead four sons and her husband

  yes said flint in a low voice thats
war and what do we british know about
it what have we suffered it makes me
sick downright sick that poor old
thing has given everything she has for
france and by god shes proud of it
we ought to be thankful that weve even
had the privilege of helping france i tell
you you fellows- and i dont often feel
about anything like i feel about this-if
wed left france to fight this thing out alone
by god we wouldnt have been fit to exist
as a nation wed have deserved to have
germany stamp us out once and for all

  the french are the finest people on
earthy bar none could any man hold back
after seeing what weve seen look what
theyve suffered look at this village-
think of the women of france giving all to
their country carrying on in spite of every-
thing living under shell-fire doing their
work and why because its for france
they dont need any persuading thats
sufficient in itself could any one men-
tion germany in the same breath as france
and think what france means to each one
of us-now and once-my god-once we
thought of france as-as what

  something like what la vie parisienne
expresses chorus girls the caffes maximes
do you think of england as picadilly and
adventure

leicester square or the night clubs or that
mob of shysters in the house of commons

or those-swine who want us to make

peace with germany and stop the war-
now when germanys still unpunished
weve done some pretty average rotten
things in the past but by god im proud
to think the british are fighting side by
side with the french and there isnt a
sacrifice that we might be asked to make
that wouldnt be worth while if it were
going to help france

  flint stopped out of breath and rather
startled by the depth of his own feelings
and found derrick staring at him intently

  long after looking back on that night
and all it stood for flint remembered the
boy standing by the dresser with the light
of the candles shining on his face and a
strange expression in his eyes fear or horror
or something akin to both

  then you think he began huskily
you think- he hesitated and cleared
his throat i suppose flint a man-
every man-ought to be willing to give all
for his country-to do anything hes asked
to do

  yes said flint and he wondered what
was coming and why the boy seemed all at
once troubled and worried yes of
course its the least he can do whats
being killed after all nothing-if youre
killed for the sake of your country whats
taking a risk if its your duty

  nothing said the boy slowly noth-
ing at all thats why were here a
man is justified in doing anything he can to
help his own people anything its his
duty eh it must be of course

  he snuffed a guttering candle with a
finger and thumb frowning as though think-
ing of other things then he yawned wearily

  my hat but im tired tonight im not
hungry so i dont think ill bother about
any dinner im going to turn in good
night all

do you mind if i go out tonight
sir to have a look at that old crater
where they told us they thought the
boches were running out a sap

  it was the morning after the battalion had
reached the trenches once more the sun
was shining in a cold pale sky a fresh wind
was blowing and the mud was drying
underfoot flint strolling along the fire-
trench piled up high on both sides with

sand-bags full of chalk from the mines had
stopped to speak to derrick in one of the
fire-bays

  whats that he said so you want
to go out on patrol eh

  he smiled rather as an elder humoring
the request of a small and precocious child
the boy flushed

  why not sir i know i can find out
whats going on and its better for one to go
than half a dozen isnt it

  you mustnt go by yourself said flint
suddenly thats settled i dont want
to lose you kid and- he paused for a
moment and thought-i tell you what
youd better take corporal dyer with you
i suppose you think i cant look after
myself grumbled the boy

  his face was very red still and offended
dignity showed in his expression

  not at all said flint untruthfuuy
only supposing you get into a scrap or are
wounded you understand

  oh i understand said derrick all
right then ill take dyer and find out
whats happening

  flint looked at him curiously his
pleasure was obvious from his manner one
might have judged that he was going home
to england rather than that he had been
told he might crawl across no mans land
to the german trenches

  the moon had set and the night was dark
and cloudy the boy went out at midnight
flint saw him before he left chuckled at his
eagerness and then when he had gone fell
to worrying an unaccountable feeling
of anxiety of fear as to what might per-
chance happen weighed him down

  calling himself names he tried to shake
off his depression and failed signally

  as the hours went by and derrick did not
return flints anxiety grew supposing the
boy were wounded and had to lie out be-
tween the lines for days supposing he were
killed-whenever rifle-shots broke the still-
ness flint would find fresh grounds for fear
supposing that they took him prisoner to
flint this was the worst prospect of all to
be a prisoner in german hands was the most
awful fate a man could suffer hell unadul-
terated better that a british officer should
die before that

  at about three in the morning derrick
returned flint in the company head-
quarters dug-out heard footsteps descend-
ing the stairs
the other side

  is that you kid he called

  yes sir and the boy his face and
hands and clothes plastered with mud
entered

  been out the devil of a time havent
you said flint curtly

  now that the boy was safe he could af-
ford to show a certain amount of an-
noyance

  yes im afraid so sir ive had rather a
job

  flint saw that the boy was troubled

  what do you mean by rather a job
not hurt are you wheres dyer

  dyer im afraid hes a prisoner ive
made enquiries and hes not back so-

  what flint whistled so thats it
what the devil happened

  first of all we crawled through a gap in
their wire sir and worked our way in the
direction of the crater it took us some
time of course as the going was bad
then we found the sap as a matter of
fact we heard them digging and that guided
us we couldnt make out very much
im afraid it was too dark but i can show
you on a map whereabouts the sap lies by
the way sir i think theyve got a machine-
gun emplacement on the northeast side of
the crater

  they opened fire from there when we
began to move back their patrols must
have spotted us some one shouted at us
anyhow and began shooting from near the
sap

  things were getting a bit hot so i
crept into a shell-hole thinking that dyer
was with me but he wasnt and ive
been looking for him ever since im
very sorry about it sir but i did my best to
find him and-i thought id better be
coming in

  good god said flint theres noth-
ing to worry about you couldnt help it
by jove though you must have had a
pretty ghastly time of it derrick

  its dyer im worrying about i didnt
go off without him-i hope you dont think
that sir

  his eagerness to make it clear that he had
tried his utmost to find the corporal struck
flint as something almost pathetic

  dont get that into your head he said

-few of us would have risked going

back to look for him as you did you did
your best what more could you do

  the boy dropped wearily down on a plank

bench and sat with his shoulders bent and
his head drooping the picture of dejection
and misery

  im sorry i made such a mess of things
he said i was responsible for dyer-and

maybe hes killed or a prisoner and-

  listen here kid said flint at the
end of the second day we were in action at
ypres-october x-id seven of my
platoon alive the others had gone west
or were wounded and i kept thinking if
id only made them dig in quicker in one
place or withdrawn a little in another or
gone ahead at the double somewhere else
or hadnt let em stop just where a jack
johnson was going to burst-well theyd
still have been with me you understand
the finest men god ever made old army of
course and fight they were gluttons
they could stand more punishment than
any men ive ever met it was my fault
of course that they were dead

  thats what i thought and i very
nearly worried myself sick and then-
well then kid i began to see what war
really meant and that to win battles youve
got to risk other lives besides your own
you understand whatever you tell em
to do theyll do it and theyll get killed-
by your orders it makes war more hellish
than ever eh and now have a drink kid
yowre shivering and as for being respon-
sible for dyer thats ridiculous dyer was
responsible for you thats why i sent him

it was just after sunrise when the
german heavy guns opened fire
flint listened to the screech of
the shells overhead

  what are they crumping now said
macdermott

from where they stood they could see the
smoke of bursting shells rising from the
ruined village behind the trenches
giving the village a dose of it eh
well im glad its not us anyway said
flint

  the luck cant last though were bound
to get it again before long said macder-
mott its too good

  it does happen like this occasionally
said flint by jove theyre chucking
them in arent they

  that afternoon flint met an artillery
officer at the blanket-covered entrance to an
o p dug-out

  hullo said flint how goes it
adventure

  but the gunner who looked tired and worn
gave him no answering smile

  you heard what happened to us didnt
you he said

  no said flint what

  this morning soon after it was light the
huns opened on us by god flint i
dont want to see anything like it again
did they do much damage

  the artilleryman laughed

put us clean out of action three
direct hits right in the gun-pits three guns
smashed to blazes weve lost three-
quarters of the battery killed and wounded
the dug-outs got hell the other batteries
in the brigade caught it pretty badly but not
like we did im feeling fairly shaky still
rough luck said flint im awfully
sorry old chap i am really he hesi-
tated old garnetts all right of course
im afraid not said the artilleryman
whats that said flint quickly not
-not killed dont say theyve killed
garnett

  yes said the other in a dull whisper
blown in half god almighty it was
awful

  whats that said a strangled voice
garnett killed

  flint saw derrick by his side

  garnett killed continued the boy
why-why i was only with him two days
ago he showed me the battery every-
thing-

  the whole batterys gone said the
gunner bridger and davidson are killed
too mulcahy is not expected to live
hesketh and grant are wounded pretty
bad isnt it

 bad said the boy bad why
its-

  he broke off and stared at the artillery-
man with an expression of frozen horror as
though the significance of what he had
heard was just coming home to him

  my god its awful poor old garnett
it was just a matter of luck really
said the artilleryman they happened to
spot us thats all so they let us have it
there were few men i liked so well as
garnett said flint soberly and now
hes gone thats what happens out here
-always every pal i ever had in the
army has been killed garnett was going
home on leave next week too he was
telling me how much he wanted to see his
wife and kiddies

  as flint turned away he noticed the lines
in the boys face and he knew that the war
with all its cruelty and terror had begun
already to leave its mark

     a company commander who is
worth his salt must take notice of
ilsssai all that concerns his company so
flint made it his business quietly and
methodically to study his officers no less
than his men lest in the hour of trial when
the machine must do the work of one double
or treble nay ten times its strength some
small cog wheel should be unequal to its
allotted task and the whole mechanism
break to pieces under the strain

  and if there were rare and depressing
moments born of the never-ending hard-
ships of a cold and bitter spring and the
uncertainty of the future when he had wild
and foolish doubts concerning stratton or
mason or even macdermott never even
when things were at their worst could he
have any fears for derrick

  derrick young as he was was splendid
in everything he undertook he proved his
value his judgment and initiative were far
beyond the average subalterns also his
spirit was too high to admit the possibility
of failure and flint knew inwardly that
however great the task that might be given
him the boy would carry on undismayed
and in spite of all would be successful

  yet as the weeks went by flint noticed
a gradual change creep over him he was
quieter than he had been at first he had
less to say and was more serious when
the others were talking he would sit by
himself listening taking no part in the
conversation but watching each speaker
intently as though perplexed or puzzled by
what they said

  on rare occasions he would talk wistfully
of home and what home meant sussex with
the little white villages nestling at the foot
of the downs narrow lanes winding be-
tween hedgerows sweet with honeysuckle
and wild roses green meadows and little
streams and copses and an old red-brick
house covered with wistaria and set among
oaks and copper beeches and elm trees with
a big lawn and garden gay with flowers and
the blue of the channel in the distance

  sometimes flint would come on him sud-
denly seated on the firestep alone staring
at nothing lost in thought when the
brigade was out at rest he showed an almost
the other side



pathetic anxiety not to be forgotten he
must pay his fair share and take his part in
everything and always in the trenches
or out flint had the idea that he was worry-
ing worrying over some deep problem that
was past all understanding

  to find an officers true worth one must
go to the men this was to flint a self-
evident truth

  for who can judge an officer more ac-
curately than the man he commands he
alone can tell whether his officer be just or
otherwise whether he consider his own
comfort as of more importance than his
mens an officer may be everything that
an officer should be in the mess yet a dis-
mal failure in the eyes of those under him
and if an officer can not win the confidence
and esteem of the soldiers whom he must
lead in battle then he is no real officer and
it were better that he had never been born

  derricks men keen judges each one of
them adored him

  this flint learned for certain one night
in march

  he stood in a traverse morosely watching
the verrey lights soar upward and listening
to the thunder of the guns in the north

  so i ses to im i ses i wouldnt do it
sir if i was you it aint your duty sir an
it aint safe 

  the words came to flint clearly and he
recognized the voice of one of his sergeants

  an he laughs sergeant he ses if we
was all to think wot was safe an wot wasnt
we wouldnt be here wed be at home
making munitions an strikin for another
arf-crown a day instead of sitting about
in the wet and gettin killed an after
that i didnt say nothin an off he goes
all by himself an later on i hears is rifle
barkin an back he comes with an old el-
met as pleased as a puppy wot ad just
pinched an old shoe from is master
did he get any one asked another
voice

  dunno hes a - good shot any-
way ive seen him in daylight in a snipers
post knockin chips of chalk off their para-
pet anyway he couldnt ave got the
elmet off a live german could he

  hes a decent sort wot ive seen of im
does e do that kind o thing often goin
out like that by himself

  often every bally night if he can i
tell you sam that kid-hes only eighteen
an he looks sixteen-that kid dont know

wot fear is hes a blasted miracle more
like a ruddy ghurka than an englishman
the platoon ud go through ell for him if
he asked em to hes the best an most
considerate orfcer i ever come across not
exceptin young flint but flints a reglar
soldierins is job

  flint chuckled in the darkness and went on
his way what he had heard satisfied him
if any doubts as to his junior subalterns
abilities as an officer had remained the mens
praises would have removed them what
they had said concerning the boy merely
proved that his own viws had been
correct

  but though flint might assure himself
that no power on earth neither hardship
nor toil neither danger nor the imminence
of death could ever daunt or diminish
derricks courage or nerve yet he had not
made due allowance for the effect of inces-
sant rain and snow and fatigue on a body
not yet keyed up to the hardships of cam-
paigning

  it was in the last week of may when
macdermott first noticed what was
happening

  flint he said if youre not very care-
ful youll find yourself short of a sub-
altern

  good biz said flint then he saw by
macdermotts saturnine face that he was
serious what are you talking about
mac youre not getting a transfer are
you

  me no but the kid is

  what the blazes are you driving at
now said flint the kids going to do
nothing of the kind to what

  kingdom come most probably

  flint was startled

  ive not noticed anything wrong he
said you mean hes not well eh

  you come and have a good look at him
now said macdermott

       so flint slipped on his belt and
followed by macdermott set off in
search of derrick he found him
as he had half-expected seated on the fire-
step in the front line gazing moodily up at
an aeroplane in the blue sky against which
the white puffs of shrapnel showed up like
cotton wool

  he lowered his eyes shivered as though
cold and saw flint

  hullo he said want me
i

adventure

  no said flint not exactly kid
you were right mac

  he continued to stare until the color
flooded the boys thin cheeks and he laughed
nervously

  whats up flint why are you look-
ing at me like that anything wrong
no how are you feeling fit
yes of course

  you dont look it then does he mac
why didnt you have any breakfast
such as it was why dont you sleep when
you have the chance

  cl j

  the boy seemed puzzled

  what makes you say i dont sleep
not feverish or anything are you
asked flint certain that his guess had been
right

  no why

  you come along with me kid ive got
something to show you mac you hang
on here till i come back

  and he took the boy off protesting feebly
to the little rabbit-hutch of a shelter which
was known officially as the regimental aid
post here they found the medical officer
short and stout and free of speech and
sundry helpers inspecting the sick of the
battalion

  doc said flint for this was a medical
officer who being loved by all was known
simply and vulgarly as doc doc will
you have a dekko at the kid and tell me ex-
actly whats ailing him

  oh - it im all right honestly i

am said the boy

  look at him doc he doesnt eat he
doesnt sleep he sits on the firestep and
shivers he goes hunting huns at night in
the wet hes thinner than he was a month

  right said the little doctor and he
produced a thermometer and a stethescope

  feel all right kid he asked after a
while

  yes

  hml doubt it any pain over the
heart

  the boy shook his head miserably

  i dont understand it said flint
hes quite different from what he used to
be

  well said the little doctor scratching
his nose with his stethescope well
theres nothing exactly wrong-organically
his lungs are all right sos his heart but

hes run down youre run down der-
rick-understand if i didnt know you
if i were back in south kensington trottin
around visitin patients at half-a-guinea
a time id say you were-well worryin
about something not in love are you
the boy laughed

  lord no

  good for you keep away from em
kid now look here youve let yourself go
all to pieces i dont know how do you
sleep well

  the doctor was filling in a sick report
usually i do but-lately- the boy
shrugged his shoulders as though to show
the futility of hiding the truth-lately
ive not been sleeping at all

  the doctor signed his name with a
flourish

  right now listen to me derrick
im serious now understand youll be
having a breakdown if youre not careful
youre on the verge now the battalion
goes out of the line in four days time but
you must go today get right out of this
as soon as you can and wait for us

  a look of distress came into the boys face
  i cant-i just cant

  you can and will my child i say it
and thats enough

  but doc you dont expect me to leave
my platoon now it wouldnt be fair
would it i cant go out and leave them
here its impossible and what about
that raid of ours i cant be out of that
ive not been over the top with the men
yet and doc im all right really i
swear i am

  even flint accustomed as he was to the
boys moods was perplexed the little
doctor frowned

  no youll do as i tell you youre
needin a rest so off you go at once and
do you mean to tell me that your platoon
cant manage for four days without you
raid or no raid of course they can
theyd far better do without you for a short
time than have you taken away for good
now thats final you clear off from the
trenches as soon as you can

  arid when the little doctor spoke like that
argument was futile the boy drifted off
looking miserably unhappy

  flint stopped behind

  whats wrong doc

  nerves simply hes all to pieces as
brave as they make em of course but hes
the other side



not strong and if he carries on the way hes
doing all work and no rest well-well be
shippin him home to england get him
to take things a bit quietly

  thats easily said doc but you dont
know the kid as well as i do hes break-
ing his heart now because youve sent him
away from the battalion-even if its only
for four days he was dead keen on going
over with us when we raid the bodies
hm seems to like his work eh
crazy about it and dont talk about
nerves hes the coolest hand ive ever
seen in action i tell you doc that boy
ought to have been killed weeks ago hell
take the most impossible risks just-well
just for the sport of the thing

that night the german guns
opened a heavy bombardment
flint in the company head-
quarters dug-out heard the screech and
rush of heavy shells

  hullo hullo whats that bit of a
hate on eh

  he stood up and reached for his steel
helmet

  a tremendous crash shook the dug-out
the timbers rocked as though in an earth-
quake earth fell through the narrow spaces
between the planks supporting the roof

  stratton came tumbling down the steep
steps of the dug-out

  my god that was near it was flint
did-did you hear it i thought it was all
up with me

  flint gripped him by the shoulders
steady old chap pretty near eh
n-near-i dud-dunno flint i thought
-thought i was done for it knocked me

down-

  you stay here stratton in the dug-
out and the noise of the bursting shells
was so great he had to shout im going
up to see whats happening

  good god flint-flint youre never
going out in this theyre dropping heavy
stuff all over the place

  all the more reason for my going ive
got to see after those poor devils of mine
slowly he climbed out into the trench
trying to shut out of his consciousness all
thought of peril and succeeding only passing
well most men would have called him
brave even in an army where cold-blooded
bravery was the rule-flint realized that
with no false modesty-but never yet had

he overcome his hatred of shell-fire with all
its infinite possibilities before each at-
tack or each spell of duty in the line he felt a
greater and ever growing need of forcing
himself to show his unconcern for ac-
cording to flints code an officer must
never show that he either feared or even
respected shell-fire outwardly at least he
must appear oblivious of danger and devoid
of fear

  so now when his whole being craved for
safety for the shelter of a deep dug-out he
deliberately climbed out into the open
cursing himself for so doing for why
should he merely because he wore three
stars on his cuff lurk in safety while others
common soldiers in rank but better men
than himself suffered the agonies of hell
if they could die so too could he if death
in action were to be his fate no power on
earth could save him from his doom

  a slight rain was falling the night was
acrid with the fumes of high explosives the
glare of bursting shells lit up the blackness
their crashing and screeching stunned the
senses to a numbed and helpless terror

  flint staggering drunkenly ran up a
short stretch of communication trench to
the chaos and horror of the front fine

  the screech of an approaching shell
made him throw himself headlong at the
bottom of the trench his hands clasped
around his head there was a deafening
roar as of the heavens splitting a blinding
flash of light the very ground heaved
upward with the explosion and flint lay
on his face half-buried by a fall of sandbags
and stunned by the concussion for a
moment he could not move then slowly
making an effort he forced himself to rise

  near at hand a ghastly voice was shriek-
ing piteously

  oh god oh god oh kill me for
gods sake

  flint shuddered and reeled on

  where are you

  but the voice was lost amid the incessant
roar of shells rushing down the steep arc
on to the tortured soil

  flint stumbled on from one broken bay
to another ducking his head as though to
shield himself from the storm of steel and
seeing in the sudden geysers of flame flung
upward dark figures of men cowering in
the muddy trench or clambering into shell
holes some were silent some swore foully
incessantly terribly cursing the god that


adventure

had brought them to this hell one was
sobbing bitterly another standing among
the dead in a part of the trench where a
shell had landed uttered wild and devilish
laughs as though fear had robbed him of
his soul and he as flint passed clutched
him by the apn

  ho you bloody orfcer-why aint you
in yer dug-out all dead every one of em
-all dead an you an me alive

  and to each man he saw flint stumbling
along through great gusts of flame shouted
words of encouragement seeking forget-
fulness of self and what might come at any
instant in the presence of those less able to
bear the strain

  get back into the supports dyou hear
me you-there

  me legs are broken-leave me be

 are you wounded or not you
this to a man face downward in a shell-hole
moaning youre not wounded then

- and blast it get up come on get

up go back into the support line at once
its your only hope and you-get on
back as i tell you you cant stop here
and maybe theyre coming over oh for

-s sake get a move on

  rounding what remained of a traverse
flint saw by the light of a star-shell mason
crouching motionless in the midst of what
had once been men lying as the shell had
scattered them

  mason old chap get back into the
supports theres no chance of holding
the front line

  mason did not speak he grasped his
shoulder but mason toppled over back-
ward and flint stooping down found that
he too was dead

  in the blackness following on the glare
flint alone with the slain groped his way
through the drifting smoke of the bombard-
ment to where a sergeant buried to the neck
in debris was crying feebly for help

  take me out of this some one for
the love of god oh god dont leave
me-

  all right sergeant flint reached his
side and digging with bare hands began to
loosen the chalk piled up around him
ill get you out hang on

  he worked with frantic haste paying no
heed to the shells intent only on the rescue
of one of his men dragging at the lumps of
chalk and clay until his nails were torn and
bleeding

  i must get something to dig with he
said hoarsely i wont be long ser-
geant

  dont leave me sir i cant stand it
much longer

  aching in each limb dizzy with fatigue
flint turned and searched the shell-holes
until he found a dead man with an en-
trenching tool blade and handle in his
equipment the crash of heavy shrapnel
bursting overhead threw him to his knees
when he staggered back to where he had
been working the sergeant was dead his
face streaming with blood from a huge
scalp wound

  flint threw the entrenching tool aside
and laughed bitterly

  oh whats the good

  the shelling ceased as suddenly as it had
begun and the pale pink sky of dawn found
tired sleepy broken men building anew the
battered fire-trench

  flint saw macdermott red-eyed and pale
and covered from head to foot with mud
coming toward him

  hullo mac he said wearily its

been the-of a night eh im about

done in

  flint said macdermott have you
seen little stratton anywhere

  me no i left him in the dug-out soon
after they started strafing us hes there
isnt he hed had a bit of a shock or
something-a shell burst near him and
knocked him a bit silly why whats up
macdermotts face was very grave
flint old man the whole dug-outs
blown to blazes a shell must have landed
right on top of it

  oh my god and poor little stratton

-it said flint fiercely i wish to

god that wed never- he broke off
with a grim laugh oh well whats the
use of it the poor little mans dead and
masons dead-i wonder if theyve taken
him away yet im glad the kid wasnt
in it its been a bad night mac as bad
as any weve had by god well take it
out of the huns for this though theyll
pay for what theyve done mac or im a
dutchman

early in the afternoon derrick
rejoined the battalion

  flint met him plodding up a com-
munication trench now no more than a
wide ditch with crumbling sides
the other side

  why the - are you here he de-
manded where do you think youre
going derrick

  front line said the boy

  he spoke gruffly without raising his eyes
and although in the past twelve hours he
had seen fear and horror and suffering in
every degree marked in the faces of his men
flint was shocked by the boys looks his
color had left him his eyes were sunken
there were hollows in his cheeks he looked
worn-out and ill

  front line said flint youll do
nothing of the kind weve no front line-
only shell-holes now-and we wont have
till weve had a chance to build it up prop-
erly im not going to have you risking
your life when theres no need for it bout
turn kid and well get along to head-
quarters its just round the corner
were using another dug-out now the old
ones crumped pretty badly what made
you come back

  the boy who had turned glanced over
his shoulder

  i heard-they told me youd had-had
rather a rotten time last night

  rather a rotten time my giddy aunt
lord kid we got it in the neck proper
we had thirty-five killed and sixty wounded
out of the company alone

  my god said the boy in a broken
voice and i was out of it after all

  out of it yes and im-glad you

were they were descending the steps into
the dug-out i couldnt afford to lose any
more of my subalterns kid

  whats that flint flint none of the
others were knocked out were they dont
tell me that for gods sake

  mason and stratton

  killed said the boy hoarsely

   fraid so

  derrick swayed and flint caught him
  steady now old chap hold up

  the boy dropped on to a wooden box and
sat for a while with his head buried in his
hands

i shouldnt have gone i shouldnt have
gone oh my god why didnt i stay
dont be a silly idiot kid you couldnt
have done any good if youd been here
flint said the boy if id known-

if id known-

  it wouldnt have made any difference
son if you had

  and the men

  youve never seen a heavy bombard-
ment have you kid weve been lucky
lately but last night made up for it
from what you read in the papers youd
think our fellows didnt mind shell-fire
he laughed they were broken helplessly
and what else could you expect but god
help em when our chaps get in among em
with the bayonets next time thats all
theyre wonderful of course said the
boy wonderful he sighed my
god this war is awful once-before
i came out i thought the army was-i hope

you dont think me a-fool flint-the

one career a man could have but its
hellish-simply hellish-and i wish to god

id never-

  he broke off suddenly and sat staring
across at flint with vacant unseeing eyes
flint frowned

  youre not fit kid thats whats the
matter why the devil did you come back

so soon

  i cant keep away flint i simply
cant you dont know how i felt when i
heard what you chaps had to go through
last night there was i skulking behind
the line while the men i was supposed to
be commanding were being butchered
i just couldnt bear to think of the battalion
being in action without me thats why
thats all very well but-youre not
fit old son and youve got to go back till
the brigade comes out of the line

  but flint the boy looked frightened
flint you forget-tonight were going over
the top-why i simply must be here
youve not altered the arrangements have
you after last night

  flint shook his head

  n-no weve not were raiding em
tonight just to prove that their old bom-
bardments dont worry us

  derrick was smiling in a puzzled fashion
but flint if were going to raid em
dont you see that ive simply got to go
i cant leave the trenches now-how can i
im afraid you must kid said flint
kindly youre not fit and thats all
about it you must have a rest im
sorry but we cant afford to take you its
not fair on yourself

  he stopped startled by the look of hope-
less despair that had settled on the boys
face

  whats up kid youre a bundle of
nerves these days that night work has


adventure

been too much of a strain on you-i thought
it would be youve got to get out of the
trenches before youre carried out on a
stretcher

  my god flint you dont under-
stand

  i understand this kid that youre not
fit youre not strong enough for the work
weve got to do tonight also im not going
to lose another subaltern for nothing
there were tears in the boys eyes flint
stared at him pityingly he was ill of
course and not himself otherwise he would
have long since given in to what was in-
evitable by this time he must know all
arguments were futile

  you dont know what it means to me
flint youve stopped me just when i
wanted to do some good i was hoping-
he made a funny almost foreign-looking
little gesture with his hands im making
a fool of myself arent i and im half
blubbing too sorry im such a fool
but id set my heart on being with the
crowd tonight when they went into the
german trenches and after last night
it doesnt seem fair somehow to be out of
it i wanted to feel i was really part of
the battalion for once and-and that i was
sharing the same risks as the others

  flint felt as though he were out of his
depth the kid was crazy he must be
no man in the battalion had run more risks
than he had what was worrying him

  youve done more all along than any
one else derrick

  the boy shook his head and looked at
flint with a curious weariness in his eyes

  no flint ive not ive done nothing
you dont understand-how could you
if youd let me go over with the company
tonight id prove everything i say now
im not like you flint i cant hide my
feelings i thought i could but i cant
i feel as if this war was driving me mad-
mad with-with anger-or hate i cant
explain but i hate the people were fighting
like i hate vermin-the rats or lice that we
get in the trenches he shuddered

  i hate their methods their deceit their
cruelty their army their kaiser their
own particular brand of god-theyre un-
clean flint like animals-theyre not
human i know-how can any one help
knowing they want to make the whole
world like themselves i hate them more
than i ever thought i could hate i want

 to kill some of them flint or-or be
 killed myself let me go for heavens
 sake

   flint listened to the boys outburst in
 silence

   at nineteen one can not have what is
 called a past of that he was certain but
 none the less the boys manner his agita-
 tion his sudden loss of control puzzled him
 he was nervous and even frightened-
 desperately frightened yet of what not
 of the germans certainly there was
 something wrong somewhere but the case
 was one that no doctor however learned in
 the ills of the flesh could diagnose or pre-
  scribe for

   well said the boy after a while
 what are you going to do

   youll have other opportunities of
 killing huns derrick theres no need
 to worry about that youre not yourself
 and youve got to rest thats final
 stay in the dug-out and go out of the
 trenches tomorrow morning only-no
 playing the fool understand youll give
 me your word of honor not to disobey
 orders and follow us over wont you
 you must stay at the phone and dont
 leave it

   all right said the boy slowly ill
 do what you say its hard of course
 but everything out here is hard isnt it
 damnably hard

the raid was a success even
flint had no criticism to offer
as it had been planned days be-
fore the bombardment so it was carried
through without a hitch

   the men of flints company had their
 allotted part on the right flank and flint
 knew by the grim look on their faces the
 stern and sullen manner in which they
 spoke that they would exact a dreadful
 payment for their sufferings of the night
 before bitter as he was he could find it
 in his heart to pity those germans who
 were doomed to meet them in battle that
 night it was a quarter to two when the
 artillery and trench-mortar barrage lifted
 and flint and his men went forward into
 no mans land they advanced slowly
 held back by shell-craters and broken wire
 above their heads screamed the shells in
 front of them crept the line of blinding
 flashes which marked the barrage
the other side



  the rat-tat-tat-tat-lat of an enemys ma-
chine gun came from the right but with
few casualties the raiders crossed the open
and burst into the german front-line trench

  by the light of the star-shells that shot
up into the darkness flint saw the fire-bay
into which he had jumped crowded with
men british and german jammed together
and fighting with rifle and bayonet and fist
and bomb

  clear em out boys he shouted
into em

  a big german struck at him savagely
with his butt over the back of a man who
was striving to hold another down at the
bottom of the trench flint dodged but
the rifle grazed his left shoulder and he was
hurled backward the german threw him-
self forward and pinned him against the
counterscarp of the trench snarling angrily
the while and shouting in german only
half-realizing what he did sick with the
pain in his shoulder flint wrenched his
right hand free and pulled the trigger of his
revolver the german with a grunt col-
lapsed  top of the two men who had been
struggling in the mud

  take em off quick shouted a gruff

voice urry ive croaked this -

blighter but im arf dead meself

  after it was all over certain pictures were
stamped vividly in flints mind seen in the
flashes of light in the midst of the blackness
a sergeant in his company a pale thin-faced
nortli-countryman with blazing eyes a
street preacher from rochdale wild with
berserk rage bareheaded fighting his way
through the press armed like some cru-
sader with a butchers cleaver a big fine-
looking german a man of substance per-
haps in his own village blood pouring down
his chin a horrible fear written on his
countenance screaming out guttural prayers
-prayers they must have been-as with all
hope of escape gone he awaited the bayonet
another-a man with the fierce eyes of a
ferret-flint remembered the eyes-fight-
ing viciously in a narrow part of the trench
until there came to him also the knowledge
of death a dug-out entrance black as the
pit and crazy men in khaki jostling each
other and shouting out demands that the
occupants should surrender then the sud-
den change of tone give it em boys-
the beggars wont come up-we cant wait
ere all night-come on now-wheres
them stokes bombs followed by the

terrific explosions and the shrieks of agony
and the dense clouds of smoke and lastly
and this happened as the rocket to recall
the raiders soared upward and flint blew
his whistle the german officer scornful and
haughty and very angry who was the pris-
oner of a small blaspheming private

  look wot ive got shouted the private
a blurry orficer get on you-or ill run
yer through i aint afraid of the likes o
you op it

  and he drove him before him with wild
oaths

  it was the prisoner who became flints
chief concern once he had got his men full
of excitement and the triumph of success
back across no mans land now under the
enemys shell-fire into the shelter of their
own lines

  sergeant-major he said call the roll
of the company find out the casualties
and send any men of a and c back to their
own companies and tell mr macdermott
to take charge for a few minutes ive got
to phone battalion headquarters at once
he turned to the small private who with
another was guarding the prisoner-

 bring that officer along now

  then he made his way down the trench
to the dug-out

  derrick was waiting for him

  hullo flint i heard you were back
everything all right

  rather im in the devil of a hurry
though and ive brought a prisoner

  the boy stood in the middle of the floor
of the small dug-out lit by candles and full
of dark shadows he was smiling a little
as though with flints return all anxiety
had gone an orderly sat on a box in the
corner flint walked over to the telephone
and the two privates their khaki and
equipment covered with mud brought in
their prisoner

  flint lifting the receiver from off the
stand saw that the boys face showed
strangely gray and worn against the black-
ness and the thought came to him that he
had done wrong in not sending him off to
hospital he wasnt fit of course he
needed a thorough rest before he would be
any good for the trenches again

  give the prisoner a seat kid will you
and a smoke

  i dont think youll get through sii
said the orderly weve been trying for
ten minutes the wires are cut


adventure

  curse said flint thats a -

nuisance he hung up the receiver
well ive got to let headquarters know
whats happened so far as d company is
concerned he nodded to the two pri-
vates all right you two youd better
cut along now wait in the trench till
youre wanted tell smith my batman
to give you a drink say i sent you

  the two privates grinning their thanks
 went out

  flint turned to the prisoner

  do you speak english he asked

the german cold scorn in his eyes

 ig shrugged his shoulders and said
      nothing

  flint grunted

  hml thats rather awkward id made
sure every german spoke english he
looked at derrick you dont speak ger-
man do you kid

  the boy moistened his lips

  you know i dont i wish i did

  and though he spoke to flint he kept his
 eyes fixed on the tall prisoner with a kind of
 sick horror in his eyes

  macdermott does anyhow said flint
 but hes the only officer in the battalion
 who can hell have to go down to head-
 quarters with the prisoner

  he scribbled a few lines in his note-book
 and glanced at his watch

  a quarter past two exactly he
turned to the orderly marshall he
said take this back to battalion head-
quarters as quick as you can its im-
portant of course

  the orderly picked up his shrapnel
helmet and respirator saluted and dis-
appeared up the stairs

  well said flint thats done by
jove im tired its been a great night
kid the men were splendid simply
glorious

  i wish id been with you said the boy
 wistfully

  i think ill go back and see the sergeant-
 major im not quite sure yet what losses
 the company had and ill fetch mac back
 with me youll stay here derrick and
 keep an eye on our friend i wont be
 long

  flint went up into the open air the
two privates were waiting

  did you get your drink he asked

  yes sir said the men thank you sir

  the germans had begun to shell heavily
but without accuracy scattering high ex-
plosive and shrapnel haphazard over the
trenches as though bent on exacting
punishment somehow but without knowing
exactly from whom

  flint walked on until he came upon
macdermott talking to the sergeant-major
near a machine gun emplacement

  well he said whats the result
ive got the names down on the list
sir said the sergeant-major theres
only five not accounted for three men
killed and seven wounded prisoners taken
by d company eleven that includes the
officer sir

  good business said flint thats
great mac i want you to go down to
battalion headquarters with the prisoner
youre the only officer in the battalion that
speaks german and i think we must find
out one or two things before we hand him
over to the tender mercies of the intelligence
people

  whos with him said macdermott
no one except the kid when i left
they were glaring at each other from oppo-
site sides of the dug-out like a couple of wild-
cats as neither of them can understand
a word the other says i suppose theyll keep
on doing it hallo

  a shell burst with a roar at the back of
the trench down which they were walking
by jove thats nearer mac

  hm the huns are angry

  dont wonder said flint we gave
em something to be angry for

  the noise of the guns made talking
difficult and they hurried on in silence
down the muddy trench until they reached
the entrance to the dug-out where the two
privates still waited crouching against the
sand-bags

  everything all right said flint

  yes sir

  any one else in the dug-out beside mr
derrick and the prisoner no other
officer

  no sir

  right well youd better wait where
you are we wont be a minute go on
mac you first

  macdermott stepped through the door-
way and on to the stairs that led down to the
dug-out flint followed looking back over
his shoulder and listening to the fierce
cracking of shrapnel bursting near at hand
the other side



   and then macdermotts fingers gripped
 his wrist with a warning pressure

   from the dug-out there came the sound
 of a low guttural voice talking angrily

   for a moment flint his thoughts back
 in the trench where the shells were dropping
 could attach neither importance nor sig-
 nificance to what was happening

   some one-the prisoner-was speaking
 why not why shouldnt he speak
 why shouldnt he even speak in german
 he wondered impatiently why macdermott
 had stopped what he was listening for

   and then it flashed into his mind that
 there were two people only in the dug-out-
 derrick and the german officer-and that
  neither could speak the others language
 the german officer must be speaking to
 himself then

   all at once a strange premonition of dis-
 aster stole over him

   what is it he said why are you
 stopping mac

   macdermott relaxed his grip on his wrist
 and moved on quickly and softly down the
 steps into the lighted dug-out

   the boy white to the lips faced the tall
 german who glared at him scornfully

   whats the matter said flint any-
 thing wrong

   i dont know the boy hesitated
 he began to talk to himself in german-
 i didnt understand him

   at that the german threw back his head
 and gave a short laugh then he spoke a
 few sharp words in german

  god almighty said macdermott
harshly

   what is it said flint what the
 devils happening

  he glanced from one to the other
 macdermott his face like stone grim and
 hard the german smiling contemptuously
 his eyes half-closed his teeth showing in a
 sneer under his fair upturned mustache
 and derrick looking like death itself so
 strange and ghastly was his expression

   for a brief space while one might have
 counted ten no one spoke

  the german laughed once more and
 bowed in an ironic manner first to flint
 then to macdermott and lastly to derrick
 then he spoke in english

   i am afraidt chentlemen dot i have
 been deceiving you i can speak english
 well but not so well as our young friendt
 here can speak gherman of course

  what do you mean said flint you
cant speak german derrick can you
you do not believe me hey said the
german all right den why does he
not say somesing-dot traitor to cher-
many he can not he knows dot der
game is finished

  what the blazes are you driving at
said flint roughly a traitor to ger-
many are you crazy

  crazy said the german bitterly
mein gott no i say it again a
traitor to chermany he knows see him
now

  the thing was monstrous so mon-
strous indeed so outrageous and absurd
that it meant nothing

  flint felt that he was growing angry
also he was frightened something was
happening which he could not understand
something that was perfectly clear to the
other three

  he turned swiftly to the boy

  derrick what is it why dont you
speak why dont you put an end to

this - foolishness this swine here is

calling you a traitor and a traitor to
germany too why because youre
fighting for your own country against his
there was no reply the boy merely
stared in the same dazed way at the big
german so thought flint might a
cornered hare have watched the huntsman

  his country said the prisoner in a
quiet voice vot is dot dot officer of
yours is a cherman i am ashamed to say
it i am in your hands chentlemen if
you kill me it is der fortune of war but
it is my duty der duty of a cherman officer
to make sure dot der traitor is punished
stop that said flint angrily the
threat in the germans tone warned him
of danger put your hands up this
instant you fool or ill shoot

but before flint could move even
while he was still speaking the
german sprang tigerlike so swift
and terrible was his onslaught and gripping
the boys throat in his two hands sent him
headlong against the boarded wall of the
dug-out

  plint jerked his revolver from its holster
and with a feeling of savage satisfaction
fired the german relaxed his grip and
fell with a clatter to the floor derrick
shoved him away and staggered to his feet


adventure

choking macdermott dropped to his
knees and turning the wounded man over
raised his head a dark red patch stained
the front of his field-gray tunic his florid
face had lost its color and his eyes were
closed flint waited in silence without the
slightest feeling of compassion

  the german had deserved to die he
had told black lies about a british officer
about an officer in the best battalion in
the british army death was almost too
good a punishment for such carrion der-
rick a german-the very idea was pre-
posterous a lie of course it was a lie
reason fought and triumphed over sus-
picion in flints consciousness

  hes gone said macdermott

  not yet said the german not yet
and he made an effort to raise himself

  macdermott slipped his arm under his
shoulders and eased him up

  he may escape me but-dere are dose
he will not escape chermany will neffer
forgive he has told you lies-and- the
prisoners eyes were glazed and dull his
breath came in deep sobs- and he has told
lies to us he will die-a traitor-but i-
die-for chermany

  his head sank forward on to his chest

  hes dead i think said macdermott
and he lowered him gently to the ground

  for a time no one spoke the gun-
fire sounded like distant surf beating on
the shore macdermott frowning a little
was rubbing the blood from off his hands
flint watched him curiously

  well said the boy in a husky tone
well

  did he hurt you asked flint

  no said the boy oh no

  i wonder if they heard the revolver
said flint i dont think so theres
such a dickens of a row going on theyd
hardly notice it he stopped short afraid
of what he must say next then with an

effort he went on quickly a - he

kid eh what he said about you

  the boy raised his hands and let them
fall helplessly to his sides

  no he said hoarsely no its true
im not english flint he was right
im a traitor to germany-because im a
german

  an icy coldness gripped flints heart
as at a distance far away he heard a stern
voice his own voice speaking

  youre what

  im german

  youre german he spoke slowly as
though to let the significance of what the
boy had said sink into his mind youre
german oh he paused pondering
but-youre fighting for us derrick
thats why youre a traitor to germany
i see now thats what he meant isnt it
and at that the boy gave a low mirthless
laugh

flint dont you understand even now
macdermott does he heard dont you
understand that i was-was helping them
helping them said flint dully help-
ing the germans

  and then all at once flint understood
he felt that he was being stifled that he
must get out into the fresh air or he would
choke his throat seemed to have con-
tracted so that it was difficult to swallow
his heart hammered against his ribs there
was a black mist before his eyes so that he
could scarcely see and a singing in his
ears

  oh my god he whispered oh my
god so its true after all

  yes said the boy its true

  and i believed in you-i trusted you-
id rather have had you with me in a tight
place than almost any other man ive ever
met-and youre a german

  the very thought hurt him it seemed
even now impossible the kid a german
an enemy

  my god its a-l he it must be

  again and again he came back to that
the impossibility of an officer in his battalion
being an enemy

  its the truth flint said the boy
wearily im a german-a german spy
i was at least im not now ask mac-
dermott he heard him talking to me but
ill tell you everything from the beginning
i must im not quite such a cur as you
think me flint maybe when ive ex-
plained youll understand when i re-
member what youve done for me and

how-

  flint stopped him

  all right derrick never mind that
now how did it happen

  it began years ago before the war was
thought of-thought of by you at least
they knew of course and they had me
trained for this-just for this end i came
over to england when i was quite small
and lived with my uncle in london he
the other side



wasnt an uncle really but he passed as
one and to all intents and purposes i was
the same as any other boy at school

  he stopped suddenly

  whats the good he asked it hurts
-like-like hell

  go on said flint finish it now
youve started

  and all the while there raced through his
mind again and again keeping time to the
pounding of his heart the awful truth
derrick a spy derrick a spy derrick
a spy

  flint you remember what you told us
that night-the night the old french-
woman heard her last son was killed at
verdun-that a man must be ready to give
all to his country-to do what hes told to
do without questioning that was what i
was doing it was for germany and
flint it wasnt easy sometimes even
when i was at school i funked it-it seemed
so hopeless-and then id remember it was
for germany the-the fatherland and
that seemed to smooth over all difficulties

  i wasnt quite old enough for woolwich
or sandhurst before war broke out but i
went to sandhurst afterward there was
no difficulty about that they were clever
flint-you dont realize how clever no-
body had any suspicions about me why
should they you didnt did you they
had money influence friends everything
to help them succeed and then i came
out here t dont think they could have
known which battalion and brigade i was
coming to-i didnt know myself till i left
the base-but they knew as soon as i got
here why i left a message at the gap in
their wire the first night i went out with you

  my work was easy all i had to do was
to let them know what was going to happen
i might have been killed by german shells
or bullets of course but what of that i
was a soldier and it was my duty to risk my
life for my country theyd taught me that
early flint dont you see that i was doing
as much for germany as you-as you were
for england dont you see that it was my
duty to help germany in every way i could

i used to go out on patrol when-
ever i had the chance i went over
to their lines of course theyd
give me helmets rifles anything i wanted
for souvenirs so that you might think id
taken them myself from men id killed

  and you remember the night i went out
with dyer flint dont you i had to get
rid of him he was in my way hes
not dead you might let his wife know
i had him taken prisoner and hes safe
in germany they wont let him write
though-not yet

  you remember too after i came that
the battalion had a quiet time in the line
you said id brought luck god forgive
me it was quiet because they knew i was
here they kept their guns off our sector

because of me and then-

  his face was very pale but his eyes full
of trouble and pain as they were met
flints steadily his voice though so low
that at times it sank almost to a whisper
was firm

  there was garnetts battery too
flint ill have the deaths of those men on
my conscience till my dying day- he
stopped short with a hard laugh my
dying day-my god-that doesnt say
much-does it

  flint shivered horror was piling upon
horror

  i gave away the battery positions-
showed em on the map where each gun-
pit was-and they knocked out the whole
battery the next day that was hell
garnett was killed and id done it
id killed him as surely as though id put
a bullet through him i was doing what
id been trained to do what i knew was
my duty yet i felt sick  went through
hell in those days flint this- again
he gave a hard little laugh-this is noth-
ing-its come as-as a relief almost after
whats happened

  oh my god the cry came from
flints heart derrick man think what
youre saying do you know what youve
just told me do you understand that
youve said that garnett and ills men
were killed through you

  yes said the boy through me
garnett was killed you remember flint
saying i looked ill i was ive never
felt-i didnt believe any one could feel-
like i felt there have been nights flint
when i lay awake till dawn-just wondering
what would happen to me and praying to
god that id be killed before you found out
i was always frightened of that always
well it doesnt matter now you know
and its finished

  but what im getting at is this flint


adventure

v

i learned after id been out here a few
weeks that i was no longer a german i
looked an englishman i spoke like one-
thats why im here of course-and i felt
like one i wasnt german any more its
true flint as true as gospel id lived in
england too long england was home the
only home i knew english people and the
english country sussex and surrey and
devon and somerset english fields and
woods and streams and orchards they
were home to me and when i came out
here i had to do my best to go back on
everything that meant anything at all

  all my sympathies were with the
british and i hated germany and what
germany stood for theyd sent me to
england to become as english as i could
id done so but id gone further than
they meant me to what else could i do
but hate myself id seen the battalion
in the trenches id got to know the men
to like them to know what they were
how splendid and fine and gentle i knew
what they suffered what theyd done out
here and i knew-and this was as bad
as anything flint-i knew that some of
those men under my command in my
platoon would be killed because of what
i was doing do you wonder that i was
nearly mad at the thought are you sur-
prised now that i looked sick

  flint i knew that bombardment last
night was coming they told me and
id been ordered to get away from the
trenches i told them once i could work
it whenever i wished-i could too-and
then i determined i wouldnt if the men
my men were to go through hell id stay
with them id stick it the same as they
did but you wouldnt let me you sent
me away i couldnt tell you could i
you maynt believe all this flint but its
the truth every word of it id rather
have been with the company in the bom-
bardment than where i was

  and flint i knew that this raid was
coming off i had known it as soon as
you did but i never told them they
had asked me if we were going to come
over in this sector i said that we werent
that was a lie of course i wouldnt tell
them i kept putting it off it didnt seem
fair somehow and when i heard the guns
last night and knew that my men were
being killed i swore that id be in the raid
myself

   i wanted to kill to show i was english
body and soul before being killed i
wanted to show i could fight as well as the
rest of you and you stopped me again
flint that broke my heart if id died
out there fighting the germans as i hoped
to die youd never have known-and now
what am i a german a german spy
a traitor to britain a traitor to germany
and ive no country

  he stopped talking and flint rousing
himself from the stupor into which he had
fallen looked at him and saw in his face
the hopelessness of despair and the knowl-
edge of what he really was an outcast an
object of scorn in the eyes of all right-
thinking men

  and all at once flint realized as never
before how young the boy really was how
forlorn and lonesome and yet how brave
a feeling of horror surged over him as he
thought of what must have been the ordeal
through which he had passed and he knew
also that there was no hope through
derrick garnett had been killed never
since the far-off days of marlborough when
the regiment first carried its colors into
battle nor through the years of fighting
that followed in germany in north
america in the west indies in egypt in
spain and portugal in france and bel-
gium in india and in russia not even in
time of disaster or defeat had the loyalty
and honor of one of its officers been ques-
tioned

  a spy a german spy flint whispered
it to himself and shivered one of their
officers was a spy and garnett was dead

macdermott was the first to
break the silence hes right
flint i heard that- he nodded
toward the dead german lying on his back
on the floor-call him a traitor he said
that hed broken his word gone back on
the fatherland-i dunno-he said a lot of
things he turned to the boy you
told him that you wouldnt go on with what
you were doing wasnt that it

  yes said the boy wearily he asked
me if id known of the raid i told the
truth for once i said i had and that
i hadnt given them any warning because
id never warn them again-of anything
i was not fighting for them any more
flint uttered a groan of agony

  my god mac it seems impossible-
the other side



impossible one of our officers and all
the time i thought he was fighting for us
he was fighting for germany doing his best
to get us beaten

   well said the boy roughly what
 are you going to do with me he waited
 a moment for a reply and then continued
 what is it to be will you shoot me
 make me a prisoner tell the colonel
 have me tried by court-martial

   the boy was standing with his back
 to the table he held himself upright his
 head tilted slightly back his shoulders
 squared his hair had been rumpled in
 the scuffle with the german he had a bruise
 on his cheek bone his collar was torn open
 showing his throat macdermott leaned
 against the wall on the opposite side of the
 dug-out his hands in his pockets his face
 half-hidden by the shadow cast by the steel
 helmet he still wore only his mouth showed
 grim and stern

   between them on the rough chalk floor
 lay the german officer his wide-open eyes
 staring up at the ceiling his arms bent and
 his fists clenched his gray uniform stained
 with mud and blood from a dark corner
 of the dug-out a huge gray rat encouraged
 by the deep silence came out but as flint
 spoke turned and scampered back to its
 lair

   tell the colonel said flint slowly
 have you tried by court-martial and
 have every one in the division know that

 you-in our battalion-that you-

   he could not force himself to finish

   the boy smiled

   that i was a german spy sent here by
 germany paid by germany why not
 i hate saying it said flint grimly
 but i wish to god kid youd been killed
 before you told us you were right in want-
 ing that it would have been better that
 way wed never have known-never
 as it is theyll all know every one its
 bound to come out now everything
 why is it said the boy

  how can we stop it said flint sternly
 derrick theres one thing i can not do
 its out of the question i know what
 war is who better each one of us must
 do as hes told i dont blame you how
 can i you did what they ordered you
 to do-for your country you knew the
 consequences of failure can i let any-
 thing stand in the way of doing what i know

is my duty can i-

 

  derrick interrupted him

  im not asking for mercy flint that
would be no use to me now ive gone
too far no one wants me im finished
but flint id like as few people as possible
to know what i really was you dont want
others to find out either do you

  i dontsaid flint but know they
must sooner or later 

  maynt there be-an-an accident
flint let me go out my own way no
one will know then and-if i thought that
the men had no suspicion of what id

been-

  flint looked up to find derricks eyes
fixed on him and in them he read an appeal
for pity that his lips could never have put
into words

  thats the only possible way out flint
said macdermott suddenly no one save
us three- he looked at the dead man once
more-need ever know

  are you strong enough derrick said
flint

  the boys lips quivered then he drew
himself up proudly

  yes i am its the one chance ive
got its that or-or every one knowing
derrick said flint ill do as you say
but i want you to answer me one question
before-before you go was there any
one else on this side helping you

  the boy shook his head

  no one ive been working on my lone
ever since i left england im speaking
the truth flint honestly

  good lord i know that of course
you are

  he hesitated

  have you any-any one youd like to
write to derrick any of your people
and as he spoke there came to flints
mind the memory of the night in the farm-
house when the old frenchwoman had
heard of her sons death and derrick had
asked if in tune of war a man were justified
in doing anything he could to help his own
people

  the boy shook his head and flint watch-
ing him wondered if after all he were
breaking under the strain his eyes were
clouded with suffering a tear trickled
slowly down his cheek his teeth were
pressed deep into his lower lip and yet as
though to prove his unconcern he tried to
smile

  no he said finally theres no one
i

adventure

no one in the world the only people i
care for are here-in the battalion so
theres nothing to worry about ive no
papers of any kind but if-if theres any-
thing flint and you mac that youd like
to keep out of my things-i wish you would
i wont ask you to-perhaps youd rather
forget me

  thank you said flint ill take
something if i may and derrick have
you anything planned

  yes said the boy ill manage id
rather it were in the open though and not
down here do you mind

  theres not much time said flint
wearily it must be getting near dawn
now

  he found it difficult to speak hardened
as he was to wars horrors this going out
to die was far more terrible than anything
he had thought possible his duty as a
soldier was clear yet he had need of all his
resolution and control to hide the pity and
tenderness he felt toward the boy whose
story he had heard

  death on the battlefield was nothing
had derrick died at the head of his men
fighting the germans he would have had
no pity only sorrow that the boy was no
longer with him and pride that he had
met a soldiers end but to die as derrick
would die alone and friendless knowing
that by his very obedience to orders he
had forfeited all right to live seemed to
flint a grim and tragic mockery of all they
fought for yet derrick must die as the
men of garnetts battery had died because
the world was at war

  he led the way up to the trench

  youll stay here and let me go on by
myself flint wont you id rather said
the boy

  the shelling had ceased in the east the
sky was a pale saffron a solitary star shone
in the dusky blue a faint breeze blew from
the north bearing with it the scent of summer

  flint drew in a deep breath

  its going to be a fine day he said
slowly

  the boy his face clear-cut and very pale
in the half-light stood by his side

  yes it will be a fine day

  the two small privates were fast asleep
huddled up in a corner of the trench still
gripping their rifles

  poor little devils said flint i
forgot all about em

  theyve had a hard time of it said the
boy you wouldnt think to look at
them that they were the men whove beaten
the greatest fighting nation in the world
look at them

  flint touched the boys arm the
thought of garnett killed by the side of his
guns hardened his heart

  come on derrick he said we cant
waste any more time ive not been to
headquarters yet theyll be worrying
have you planned what youre going to do
there mustnt be any mistake about it
whatever it is

  the boy nodded

  it will be all right flint ill take care
he hesitated i dont like to ask it but
id feel better if you and mac would shake
hands with me before i go will you
of course said flint thrusting out his
hand why not good-by kid youre

-brave over it all its too late now

but-i wish to god id shot that german
in his own trenches

  the boy drew himself up and saluted
then he turned and made off toward the
front line flint watched him disappear
around a bend in the trench

f  there goes one of the best sol-

f  diers ive ever seen thats the
finish mac poor poor kid

  a lump came to flints throat and he
could not speak

supposing he doesnt do it said
macdermott in a husky whisper sup-
posing he goes across to the germans
flint conscious all at once of the pain in
his bruised shoulder answered him fiercely

  i hope to god he does but he wont
mac hell never go back on his word
thats why i let him go

as he spoke the stillness of the dawn was
shattered by the crash of an exploding bomb

  hes done it said flint poor poor
kid i was right mac thats the end
they waited on in the narrow trench
until at last a man came running toward
them his face pale his voice hoarse with
the horror of the news he brought

  sir captain flint an awful things
happened

  well said flint sharply what is it
speak up man

  theres been an accident sir mr
derricks been killed by a bomb he was
looking at
the overland freighters

by e a brin instool

mo compile even approximate
statistics of the overland travel
and freighting across the plains
before the advent of the rail-
road would be an impossible task it is
estimated however that forty-two thousand
persons made the overland trip by wagon
in  alone on the heels of this vast
migration immense freighting facilities
sprang up by the os it is stated that
sometimes as many as five hundred heavily-
laden wagons passed old fort kearney in a
single day in  six thousand wagons
each carrying from one to four tons of
freight passed this same post

  one firm alone and that one the great-
est-russell majors  waddell-at the
height of their freighting operations em-
ployed six thousand two hundred and fifty
wagons and seventy-five thousand oxen
these immense freighting wagons were
seventeen feet long and six feet deep with a
capacity of from five thousand to sixteen
thousand pounds each and cost from eight
hundred to fifteen hundred dollars each
first-class mules five hundred to one
thousand dollars a pair harness three
hundred to six hundred dollars to the ten-
mule team besides salaries provisions and
incidentals in brief a first-class freight-
ing outfit in the days of the plains travel
cost as much as an up-to-date vestibuled
passenger train of today

  the height of this freighting was the
period from  to  the floating
population then on the plains was about
two hundred and fifty thousand in 
over twenty-one million pounds of freight
was shipped from atchison kansas alone
requiring  wagons  mules 
oxen and  men

  the tariff of the overland freighters be-
tween atchison and denver-six hundred
and twenty miles-averaged as follows
flour nine cents per pound sugar thirteen
and one-half cents bacon and dry-goods
fifteen cents whisky eighteen cents glass
nineteen and one-half cents trunks twenty-
five cents furniture thirty-one cents

   the above is the tariff on a very small por-
tion of what constituted a freighters load
everything went by pounds the trip from
atchison kansas to denver col-
miles-took twenty-one days for wagons
drawn by horses or mules five weeks for ox-
trains

  another of the greatest of these freighters
and stage-line kings was ben holliday at
the height of the overland business he
operated nearly five thousand miles of
daily mail stages with about five hundred
coaches and express wagons five hundred
freight wagons five thousand horses and
mules besides a host of oxen

  on the main line he used two thousand
seven hundred and fifty horses and mules
and one hundred concord coaches it cost
fifty-five thousand dollars for the harness
alone and his feed bill was one million
dollars a year to equip and run this line
for the first twelve months cost two million
four hundred and twenty-five thousand
dollars the government paid holliday a
million dollars a year in mail contracts in
 grain was twenty-five cents a pound
along the line and hay as high as one hun-
dred and twenty-five dollars a ton in a
single day one of hollidays grain buyers
contracted for seven missouri river steam-
ers to load with corn for hollidays army of
horses and mules

  on top of all this was the tremendous
losses occasioned by the indian depreda-
tions between i-i the savages so
crippled his stage line-nearly all the stage
stations for a hundred miles being burned
the stock stolen and the men killed-that
the loss was close to half a million

  but alexander majors was probably the
best-known and best-loved of all the over-
land freighters he died about  he
was a kentuckian a christian gentleman
who never drank nevec-swore and who made
every one of his employees sign a contract
not to drink swear or gamble under
penalty of dismissal from his service

  majors stage line from denver to salt
lake had a run of over six hundred miles
without a single town hamlet or house on
the entire route between leavenworth
and denver he had one thousand mules and
fifty coaches the first of these hoss-
power pullmans reached denver may 
 occupying six days for the six hund-
red and sixty-five-mile journey horace
greeley editor of the new york tribune
was one of the passengers

  but the coming of the railroad across the
plains in  drove romance forever from
the great silent stretches just as the advent
of the telegraph made the pony express
but a memory


the american legion suggested and
originally organized by us of the camp-
fire was turned over to the government in
december  and thereby went out of
existence as a private organization only
partial use was made of it but that was not
the legions fault and the work it was doing
beforehand is the same work the govern-
ment has had to do since we went into the
war military authorities considered it the
most practical step taken for defense before
the war and it had high value as propa-
ganda in a country that at the time cer-
tainly needed to be waked up to the peril
that has since materialized we need feel
only proud of the organization we started

  even after a year and a half men try to
join it its mail still comes in and is for-
warded from its old address to me from
its former secretary dr john e hausmann
i hear frequently he is a captain in the
quartermasters department though he
preferred the medical corps and is trying to
get to france from what i can hear the
reason he doesnt get to france is that he
has made himself too valuable where he is
and they wont let go of him heres luck
to him and may he see france in several
letters he has sent his regards to the camp-
fire and i transmit them herewith

i admit i didnt even suspect the

mr lyle told me about it it might be

read the story we took it because we
liked it as a straight story the allegory
part therefore is velvet so far as we are
concerned but knowing about it before-

uncle frank knew the indians inti-
mately in the old days

   some tribes scalped differently as did individuals
occasionally the latter skinning whole head again
with ears attached or pieces from the side of the
head but tha lock differed some atlantic
coast tribes shaved and left a piece extending to fore-
head like the dewdad on a roman helmet or shaved
all but the actual lock the whorl at back of
head

  plains tribes did not shave head being neither
mussulmans or mongols

tefore scalp dried it was stretched on a little
hoop and cured then trimmed and pared and
when attached to articles of dress the skin part was
rolled into size and shape of pencil or little finger
and attached how do i know well after hav-
ing been called a damned gowl by an army officer
i surely ought to know had not all my effects
been destroyed some years ago by a fire would send
you some samples bona fide ones at that but not as
well fixed up as injun cured but greater honor
than taking a scalp was batting a strike or coup
with the hockey or shinny-shaped coup stick re-
member many or plenty coups ty cobb as it
were of his day or is it honus any squaw could
kill or scalp but to hit a corpse or blesse with the
coup-stick in the heat of action was a greater achieve-
ment and so honored

qure i got a medicine-bag and have opened
many a one same as we used to open the skin-
wrapped dead uns stuck up on pole platforms when
lucky enough to find them when the upright
skin ioles rotted and fell or were blown down the
varmint cleaned up the rubbish but sometimes a
comparatively fresh one was found and even to
windward was far from fresh those book or closet
ethnologists and some of the field variety suffer
from a species of strabismus even cant see what is
before their nose or distort it from their civilized
view-point sort of like english and french view of
our customs etc-them us an us them

  look into the political economy of dakota con-
federacy its pure democracy and find that men of
wealth did not exist or they gathered wealth only
to turn over to the clan or tribe and so acquire


the camp-fire	

merit red cloud three separate times was worth
or gathered injun wealth to the value of an ameri-
can equivalent of  and other big chiefs
nearly as much all of which was gathered not for
personal use but for the tribe

the word dakotah meaning men typifies
them people they were men except in the
eating line there was nothing an old-time plains
injun would not eat except apples and fish after
one had seen a buck with a yard or two of milk guts
hanging out of his jaw a hunk of raw hot liver in
one hand and a gob of the undigested contents of the
critters paunch in the other for a vegetable relish
one could understand why you could smell em a mile
to windward summer camps were not bad but
winter camps wooh the trenches in yoorup
arent in it every one stripped at night even at
forty degrees below just naturally had to or be
eaten alive my skin crawls yet and its fifty years
or more a strange fact is that the yankee troops
had more lice than ours why never could rea-
son it out a texas law used if not now to pro-
hibit injuns entering or living within the borders of
the state too much comanche and by-the-by
the comanches used to have a queer scalp-lock ap-
proximating the pawnees and kioways who were
undoubtedly of the same original stock

  and the plains indians or mcat-eaters used to
have a profound disgust for the n w tribes whom
they termed fisheaters as an englishman uses the
term hun or an american wop dago mick or hunk

and pipe ceremonies varied in some pre-
sented with both hands bowl to right or left pipe
in council passed if i remember to left-hand party
hard to remember after so many years any old
pipe would not do certain pipes for certain occa-
sions and pipe-keepers who guarded the same
smoking was religious or ceremonial as on occasion
of receiving visitors councils powwows and was
sucked like a chink sucks a dope-pipe everything
per ritual in fact their whole lives were per ritual
do you know the reason of the waddling shuffle of
the squaws roping and the law of the roping
of the legs and the many ways it was done and pen-
alties for violation do you know the working of
what whites would call divorce that women were
not bought as wives except occasionally a captive
that the home pertained to the squaw she could fire
the buck out if she felt like it oh heaps of things
that nine-tenths of the book-writers never fathomed

and do you remember how the army and plains-
men roared in mirth when the meeker outfit
women protested that the injuns had been galahads
with them first thing done was to violate the
person of a woman captive sometimes even in a
fight

  and do you know of the milliards of secret so-
cieties and how some went broke buying captives
from neighbors and giving em their liberty a
bunch of yanktonais adolescents did that right after
new ulm and col chivington and his st col cav
at sand creek started the war that ended in  at
wounded knee by massacring the so cheyennes
who came in for a council that dog soldiers
were the police and were the only ones who could
strike or man-handle or legally bump a tribes-
man the voyagers mixed up dog soldiers with

cheyennes who were not dakotahs but conquered
and incorporated with the latter

and do you know what caused the big cicatrices
on breasts and shoulder-blades of the bucks
the ordeal of the sun dance and rain in the face
through enmity to the medicine-man who slit him
endured longer and busted more muscle and flesh
than any other ever known that marriage went
by clans the laws being frequently unobserved but
the violation frowned upon as when an eagle took
a turtle to wife that a band was not always all
one clan but various weaker bunches who joined
some well-known astute chief or followed a famous
war chief that government was by the elders
and not by individual chiefs and that obedience to
any order of a chief was voluntary and optional

with their new serial beginning in this
issue the following from kathrene
and robert pinkerton will be of interest

  father jacques marquette is generally con-
sidered the discoverer of the mississippi river
by most historians the credit is given to louis
joliet who was trained for exploration work through
many years and finally sent out to find the great
water by the governor of new france mar-
quette who had spent several years on the southern
shore of lake superior and at the north end of
lake michigan had the jesuit desire to find new
lands and new peoples to bring into the church
he planned the trip for several years and it is
possible that it was arranged that he and joliet
make the journey together

a fter their return from the voyage of dis-
covery which look them far down the river
and back to lake michigan by way of the illinois
river marquette remained on lake michigan
that he might return to establish a mission among
the illinois the next summer he wrote of his
voyage and drew a map of the northern mississippi
valley which he sent to montreal but he died
about two years later after a visit to the illinois

  joliet with complete accounts of his discoveries
and a good map of the great valley and its water-
ways hastened to montreal when only a few


adventure

miles from the city his canoe was overturned in
some rapids in the st lawrence and he barely
escaped with his life his map and account had
only his memory as a basis but these were sent to
paris at once

  because of this accident marquettes journal
and maps were the ones to receive publication a
few years later and early historians in this century
credited him with the discovery researchers now
generally give joliet the credit at least equal credit

tj owever though there are no records of
actual discovery any historian who has dug
into original sources of information grants readily
that there is no doubt that some of the coureurs
de bois reached the mississippi and even went
beyond it before marquette and joliet reached it
june   these frenchmen trading without
royal license as many of them did were forced to
keep their journeys secret many of them were
forced to trade with the dutch and english at
albany n y where they obtained goods and
sold their furs they were a wild daring irre-
sponsible class of men and there were several
hundred of them in the region about the western-
most of the great lakes nothing daunted them
neither indians nor the immensity of the wilderness
and there is no reason to doubt that more than
one of them crossed the great water but never
mentioned that fact when he returned to the st
lawrence nicolet was within three days paddle
of the mississippi river when he was on the wis-
consin forty years before marquette arrived and
any coureur de bois had the information necessary
to reach the mississippi

tjeuben gold th waits who knew more of
the history of the first days on the upper
mississippi than any other man said there was no
doubt that several coureurs de bois were ahead of
marquette and that it was even possible that an
englishman from the colony of virginia had pene-
trated to the great river prior to  it was this
statement that suggested the story before mar-
quette

  we had been impressed for several years by the
romantic story of the first french in wisconsin
minnesota illinois and michigan it is a hazy
story the more alluring and romantic because so
much is only suggested because there are so few
facts and yet room for reasonable but marvelous
deductions

ttie life of the coureurs dc bois is largely the
basis for this few men have been given the
opportunity for more wonderful adventures yet
the very nature of their operations made publicity
undesirable and historical allusions little more than
imagination - arousing conjectures there were
however some able upright men among them as
nicholas perrot and in before marquette we
have tried to show the worst and the best of the
coureurs de bois

  our information was obtained entirely from
original sources some works as perrots having
just been published in english the jesuit rela-
tions have long been known but perot in what
was intended as a confidential report to the in-
tendent of new france told of his life of thirty
years on the great lakes and upper mississippi
river and gave minute descriptions of the indians

their many inter-tribal wars their migrations and
also their customs habits etc

the american public has never understood the
indian and has never known what he is really
like fiction massacres and the results of in-
justice had induced queer conceptions and yet the
indian of the upper mississippi valley before the
coming of white men was far different than he is
today one reason for drawing a more intimate
sketch of the sioux was to show how vastly dif-
erent he was from the man custer met in wy-
oming

  another thing that has never been recognized
in fiction and by only one historian and that is the
effect of the fur trade on the spread of civilization
it was for fur and fur alone that all the first trails
were blazed and the story of the upper mississippi
down to the fall of the fur trade less than a hundred
years ago has been duplicated in canada and the
history of discovery there

ae were both born and have lived much
of our lives in the region described in before
marquette many of the scenes are familiar to
us though it is hard to imagine marquette win-
tering at the forks of the chicago river after seeing
the man-made river of today we have paddled
many of the streams dick jeffreys traversed have
camped where he camped and in writing the story
have lived over again many of our experiences we
have sat for hours on the great bluff from which
dick first saw the great water and now we are
confronted with the necessity of forgetting dick and
his journeys if we dont well really believe he did
discover the father of waters-kathrene and
robert pinkerton

the suggestion by c r rollings at a re-
cent camp-fire that we should pay our
tribute to the late jack london has met
with such response that there is not room
for all the tributes that have come in nor
is there need of all of them in print the fact
that they came is the important one and
one or two can typify our camp-fire feeling
for the great and loved adventurer who has
left us

  personally i never met him and our slight
acquaintance is limited to a letter or two
and to the fact that he was an interested
member of our camp-fire and yet even
the few written words from him are suffi-
cient to establish him as what he was-not
just a famous writer and adventurer but a
real man it is only this simple tribute that
i can pay him from my own acquaintance
with him yet if you understand that simple
tribute as it is given you will know it is high
praise

  let us listen to the words of our com-
rade of the writers brigade j allan
dunn and to the poem he has written to
his friend
the camp-fire	

t-jeartily in accord with the suggestion of mr

     rollings at a recent camp-fire i feel that the
memoriam of jack london is in a measure up to
me in all probability he and i were more intimate
than was the case with other members of the camp-
fire who personally knew him but this privilege
but makes me feel the more inadequate to fulfil the
task 

  i think one of the greatest attributes of jack lon-
don was the brave gentility of his spirit in the
beginning all things were against him he trailed
in the mire by force of circumstance he saw the
seamy side of the world and while his spirit re-
volted against the injustice the inhumanity that he
encountered so that in youthful bitterness he ac-
counted himself an outlaw yet his inherent sweet-
ness was unspoiled and when his full manhood was
achieved his soul used his harsh experiences only
as a means to belter sympathize and understand
and to treat them as a flux by which his genius
crucibled the real impulses of humanity

f any there are who have sel jack london down
as a roughneck and a socialist little knowing
the man there have been attempts to show him
as lacking in american patriotism as a pacifist a
pacifist jack london was ever a fighting man a
biography of him might aptly be styled a fight
with fortune he was always fighting against
poverty against lack of education he fought for
opportunity he wrote for years before he achieved
either recognition or a bare livelihood he fought for
years against sickness with a body weakened in the
very beginning by the lack of fair food and lodging
weakened yet more by stomach troubles aggravated
by the hardships of his travel in strange seas and
lands under unfavorable conditions his nervous sys-
tem largely smashed by tropical sun-rays in the
snark voyage his spirit maintained a false but
vibrant virility it was ever buoyant ever gener-
ous i have known many days when jack london
fought off sickness to accomplish his allotted task
and at the very end he wrote until the final uncon-
sciousness overcame him and he always fought
smiling obstacles to him were only tilings to be
surmounted he bucked his way to the mastery
of words he never ceased to study when naviga-
tion was wanted he went at it while handling his
own roving vessel and mastered it-smiling he was
a magnificent fighter he loved life and loved to
live and the pity of it was that one so truly vital so
eminently understanding of the prime motives of us
all should have gone in his prime

to me he is not dead he was on his way to
visit me when stricken down and now the mem-
ory of him the inspiration of him is so vivid so
enlivening that i know his spirit moves and has its
being in some strong measure here if i meet him
on some stretch of elysian sand he will be no
stranger and the place will be no longer strange if
according to certain creeds he and i should meet in
hades that spot will have lost much of its allotted
terrors-and jack london will still be smiling

  he was nearly read out of the socialist party for
his iron heel in which he conservatively-accord-
ing to his own conviction-set the socialistic mil-
lennium hundreds of years ahead and hinted that it
must come from within bom of a universal desire
he separated himself entirely from the party when
he found its trend was against the democracy of

america and the participation of that democracy in
behalf of the rights and freedom of its citizens and
their allies

gocialism to him was an ideal and with ma-
turer years and judgment he did not always
find himself in harmony with the actions of its more
ardent propagandists yet always he welcomed
those he had styled comrades in the days of his
trampdom and social outlawry seldom was the
little cabin on the ranch at glen ellen without some
vagrom occupants exploiting jack london it
got to be so bad that in sheer defense mrs london
and nakata most lovable and faithful of japanese
majordomos conspired to stop the lavish food sup-
plies and jack was himself brought to see that his
generosity was being abused yet jack in the dead
of night would steal down silently and rob his own
cellar burglarizing the lock and packing a sack of
flour and a ham across the ranch to set it down out-
side the door where those ever-sleepy brethren
of his drowsed content in their belief in jacks easy
hospitality besides this he held out a sure hand of
encouragement and employment for certain men who
had served their time in san quentin or folsom

  nor with a hundred calls on him with his words
worth each one what would have bought him a meal
in earlier days did jack ever hesitate to set aside
his own affairs and help some struggling author or to
welcome a boys school or some such caravan that
came to see jack london he was pre-eminently
human adversity sweetened his spirit rather
than soured it and prosperity-self won-still fur-
ther ripened it

jack rode fearlessly he could sail his ship and
guide it he could swing a coaching-team skil-
fully across skiddy pitches and tool them with the
utmost chivalry and appreciation of their efforts
he swam like a kanaka and dived like neptune
apparently he never tired he was a he-man who
stood up and grinned at trouble was absolutely
frank in self-analysis and confession and held a
charity toward the weaknesses and backslidings of
others coupled with the will and action to help that
made him a potent example of real christianity

  a strong spirit and a sweet one unaffected des-
pite all rumors jack abominated a stiff collar
because he felt better without one never was a
man who posed less

the story-teller absolute his tales echo with
reality because he wrote only of what he knew
what he had seen enlivened with his genius his
intuition for what a man must feel and always he
sought and traveled so that his store of knowledge
so largely unused might increase absolutely lack-
ing in conceit he called his wonderful technique
tricks he was the first to acclaim merit in
others and the first to abominate charlatanry of all
kinds save as he might forgive it in his friends for
the better sides of them he knew brass tacks
he would cry when guests spoke metaphysics
we are living now we can not get away from the
now get down to brass tacks let us argue
along tangible lines

  jack london was a living answer to that vexed
question of whether an adventurer can ever forsake
the camp-fire for the home-side hearth and whether
the love of woman can ever take the place of the
wander-love of the wonderful intimacy between


adventure

jack london and ckarmian london i shall say
little its tics were and are sacred as they were per-
fect i do not cite them as an example their
unity was made up of an affinity welded and re-
fined by understanding sacrifice unselfishness that
is only too rare but he showed that the true wan-
derer need not go mateless

no one can analyze genius london wrote of
what he had seen and heard and lived his motif was
life and the red blood of him tinctures the ink in
which his words are printed jack london the
writer lives in his books jack london the man
was despite his differences with the propaganda of
that party to which he felt himself intuitively
affiliated a true socialist he was plucky he was
generous to a fault utterly unselfish absolutely
frank to all who came in contact with him he was
a true comrade

and man and writer are indissolubly linked

    he called up the nomad spirit of his own
nordic race the vanishing blond as he was
wont to style it he challenged he challenges in
all of us the viking mood the desire to go beyond
the rim of things to fight to conquer if possible or
to go down fighting-and smiling he lifted us out
of the commonplace he made the daily round less
sordid for a while he revived romance is hearts
made dull by drudgery and this not less by the clear
fire of his own fighting manhood as by the flame of
his genius by all the tokens he was a man

    a few of us who knew him very well and know the
deeds he did in secret as well as in the open called
him greatheart

a recent letter from w townend-
showed him stationed in ireland after
going through most of the war on the
french front the following bears on his
novelette in this issue

   the tale is not an effort of wild imagination it
 is fiction of course but i did not write it without
 a good foundation of fact to build on and as
 i always say in almost every tale i write in war the
 impossible becomes possible

   story-writing is simply a matter of luck it is
difficult to find time and i am usually too busy to
do more than a little work each day

   as you will sec by the address i am now in ireland
 the weather is glorious so is the country the
 people are-well beyond all understanding i like
 them but to understand them is quite another
 matter is there a solution to the irish problem
 i thought once there was now having spoken
 to most classes of irish i am not so sure-w
 townend	

from twenty-five miles from a railroad
and  feet in the air comes greet-
ing from one of us with word about a bit
of the old west

cake oregon

   this is an interesting country a part of the
real old west and while most of the old land-
marks in this section have wholly disappeared ihe
halo of romance still remains fostered by the tales
and reminiscences of the few yet living who were
here during the stirring times of forty or fifty years
ago when the malheur and mormon basin placer
mines were in the heyday of their frontier glory

tn this county malheur was the town of el
dorado one of the first and liveliest camps of the
early days of which not a vestige remains at this
time where at one time lived xx to 
people with nicely built painted houses a -room
hotel lots of stores saloons dance-halls etc etc
nothing is left not a board or brick nothing except
the glamour of its remembrance in fact in driving
along the road one would never know that a thriving
and prosperous community had ever existed there
originally the town was the headquarters of the
eldorado ditch company who constructed a ditch
ico miles long to bring the water to these rich
places some idea of the magnitude of the enter-
prise may be gained from the fact that the rents
for the privilege of using this water ran as high as
 to  in the total annually

qeveral miles from the site of eldorado is the
town of malheur known in the early days as
malheur city which was also one of the principal
headquarters of the early-day placer-miners here
still remain a few stores and houses and an odd
fellows hall reminiscent of the good old days
inhabited by possibly fifty or sixty people but all
the camp-fire	

 the glory of former days has long since departed

  several miles beyond malheur right by the road
and in the midst of the sage-brush-covered prairie
is a small bright green spot enclosed by a fence
where the luxuriant grass still thrives from the
adjacent spring-as it were an oasis in the desert
here away off by itself once flourished a prosper-
ous brewery located there on account of the water
being particularly adapted to the manufacture of
beer-good beer and believe me lots of people
wish it were still there but alas nothing remains
but the grass and the spring

otill farther on is the site of the old town of
amelia where naught but a battered old out-
house remains of a busy and populous community
of forty years ago a few miles beyond lies mormon
basin said to have been one of the richest placers
in the world and originally located by the mormons
-tradition tells us they used to carry the gold away
by wagon-loads i have never heard this verified
by any one who saw the wagon-loads but the fact
remains that it was one of the richest districts ever
known placer-mining is still carried on in a small
way by one or two who employ the few old china-
men yet remaining of the many who were brought
there in the early days chinese were always used
preferentially in this work on account of their in-
herent honesty at least it is said a greater percent-
age of them were honest than of other nationalities

aillions of dollars in gold was produced from
 these big rich placers and we are told that the
mother lode which fecj them has never yet been
discovered by reworking the old ground with more
modem methods we occasionally see one of the
old-time prospectors still searching for his ledge
always cheerful and optimistic and will be until
the end

  this whole section of country is replete with
legends and traditions romantic and interesting
dealing with the early life amongst the sturdy
pioneers the miners and indians-a good field for
the historian and story-writer with ample room
for the exercise of his talents

  the writer first came west as a boy in s
living on the idaho frontier where many exciting
events happened and is glad indeed to note the
camp-fires efforts to correct errors and preserve
authentic records of those events and happenings
incident to that stirring and strenuous period as
well as of the people who participated therein and
helped make history-q

through the courtesy and
thoughtfulness of mr b w denison
sunday editor of the chicago herald
i received the following telegram

                                 april  

  arthur j hayes died tuesday at camp grant of
pneumonia

  he is the second of our comrades of the
writers brigade to die within a short time
and though he just as truly gave his life for
his country as if he had died in the trenches
we know that he would rather have passed
out fighting

  we will remember him for his stories
notably that fine dog story the epic of
silver king but we remember him also as
our comrade let us turn back to what he
said to us something over a year ago when
according to our custom he stood up and
introduced himself to the camp-fire

                       chisholm minnesota

  your forwarded leter was received in the pelican
lake country several days ago the half-breed
trapper who obligingly brought it in from orr was
not returning so i was unable to get my reply out
more promptly i have been on the trail of the
vanishing lumberjack for the past week endeavor-
ing to tone up my local color for a series of stories
the old two-fisted red-sliirted calk-booted char-
acter of earlier eras has disappeared the old
tote-trails are grown in with grass and the tar-
paper flaps a forlorn specter on the ridge-pole of
the camps that were to-day they build with
milled lumber import jacks who pack their be-
ongings in straw suit-cases and who have attained
the effeteness of unions labor agitation and or-
ganized strikes and drag the log-laden sleighs with
caterpillar tractors but to gi t to the autobiography

was born in duluth minnesota in the early
nineties my earliest recollections arc of
that strip of strangely wild territory between the
mesaba range and the rainey river knew it
when the indians killed swimming moose with
axes from canoes and shot whitefish endeavoring to
leap kettle falls have vague recollections of the
high ebb tide of the seine river gold-rush an
aftermath of the klondyke frenzy when thousands
of gold-seekers poured into mine center in quest of
an ontario el dorado they poured out again
disgusted and disillusioned the stamp-mills and
shafts long since abandoned are among the show
places of the rainey

  it has been my lot hitherto to live rather on the
fringe of things saw the only gold brick the foley
mine ever turned out and the troops that poured
in after the nett lake fiasco in  have ridden
eight miles about one jump ahead of a forest fire
and witnessed the burning of chisholm in 
in the slates greatest conflagration knew most
intimately perhaps all phases of the minnesota
lumberjack existence have seen him in his hey-
day and decline there -re some corking good tales
in the old mackinawtd vikings of the pine country

j-j avent adventured myself but have been
rarely fortunate in meeting in the out-of-the-
way places many a man who had have done cub-
reorting attended college and instructed sundry
classes in rhetoric i like the lonesome trails and
the men from the far horizon will annex an ll b
in june but aspire rather to journalism and fiction
the family have pioneered from my birth and have
seen the older wilder days of the iron ranges
regret that i can not qualify with camp-fires
first-hand performers hope to break in later with
something actually worth while

  our salute to him standing hats off and
may his way be smooth over the last

 auto opportunities in south america

  question-i am an australian physically un-
fitted for any more war service by two years in
flanders and gallipoli i have studied the auto-
tire repair business from a to z with the goodrich
tire works have just  cash is there an
opening for me in south america-brazil preferred
do you know of any one with whom i might com-
municate as to the chances of repair business in
rio i cant speak the lingo but can stenograph
as a side line-john phelan akron ohio

  answer by captain dingle-if i am to advise
you on south america i must begin by stating
frankly that i believe argentina and uruguay oser
much the greater possibilities to settlers or im-
migrants

  brazil is a great country but the cultivated-
or cultivatable-portion is settled to a far greater
degree than other places and business needs far
more drumming up there than in the two countries
i mention one other thing is that the language
must be learned if a man expects to ever amount to
much in business you can easily realize that if
a frenchman or chinaman or greek comes here
he can not carry on much business until he leams the
language of the country can he well then
thats your position in south america without
the language in brazil you need portuguese in
most of the other places spanish is used

  your knowledge of stenography is under the
same handicap not many concerns can afford to

employ clerks with only one language if that one is
a foreigner there are of course a few openings
such as government offices having much direct
communication with america but in general youll
find you need spanish or portuguese

  as for your capital im afraid that wont do much
more than carry you down there buy a reasonable
outfit and keep you safe for a week or two until
you strike something my advice would be to try
for a good agency-such as the goodrich-and
take it down with you then youd have a standby
until your repair business got started

  monte video or buenos aires arc great cities and
equal to rio in every way and the back countries
offer rather more openings than does brazil in
argentina-spanish spoken here as in uruguay-
there is a great and growing demand for cheap
light cars and tire repairs must be in demand

  i believe if you will write to francisco j yanes
pan-american union washington d c stating
your resources wishes and ability he can give you
some up-to-the-minute data on these places which
will be rather more valuable than my experience of
farther back since the war has upset everything in
the way of trade centers ocean travel and expenses
the same source will bring you data of brazil argen-
tina uruguay or any south american republic
if then you decide definitely where you will go
and want to know anything of a more intimate
nature such as outfit customs etc i shall be happy
to reply to you further

  queen charlotte and porcher islands

  question-i am getting ready to start to british
columbia and would like information on queen
charlotte and porcher islands are they very
heavily timbered or is there some open country on
them suitable for stock raising also about the
wild cattle on quen charlotte how many are
there who do they belong to and would any one
be privileged to get them-pink becker west-
fall ore

  answer by mr carson-there is very little
heavily timbered land on the queen charlottes
most of it being very scanty with lightly timbered
muskeg and many open spaces it has the reputa-
tion of being a stock country tor fair with a winter
that only needs feed enough to be an insuiance
against an unusually heavy snowfall write
deputy minister ol lands victoria b c f r sur-
veyors reports they have been surveying up there
for years porcher has been pretty well taken up so
far as good agricultural land is concerned but i
understand that several claims have been allowed
to lapse and that a man can find some pretty good
stuff there yet

  as for the wild cattle when the grand trunk
pacific railway was projected an old greaser known
as mexican tom brought up a small herd and
turned them loose near bearskin bay or masset as
it is now called intending to sell the increase to the
contractors who built the road by some means the
big cattlemen ol alberta who had also established
herds in advance of the railway got the company so
tied up on a contract that it did not dare take toms
cattle or even afford him transportation to the main-
land where he might have disposed ot them in inde-
pendent markets

  in disgust the old fellow turned the bunch loose to
shift for themselves and returned to the south flat
broke preferring to lose all rather than sell to the
men who had beaten him at their price this was
the origination of the wild cattle on the islands and
there are several hundred of them still there accord-
ing to report i know the jap miners from judway
used to come up every year and lay in their winters
supply of beef at the cost of killing and transporta-
tion so it is a safe bet that any one else would have
the same privilege

  this in itself should answer the question of the
fitness of graham island as a stock proposition

a summer on the great lakes

  question-i am planning on spending the next
summer on the great lakes what sort of boat
will be the best adapted for going it single-handed
what kind of equipment should i take for best re-
sults would it be better to depend on camping at
night or take a boat on which one could live per-
manently ill want to fish take some pictures
and just live would like to go among the islands
of the upper lakes i think where can one get
charts of the lakes and where may one purchase
real has been books or articles on trips of this sort
where can i purchase a boat such as you advise and
about how much will it cost-asa i belt rock-
ford 

  answer by mr spears-i rowed  miles or
more on lake superiors north shore lake on-
tario etc in a -foot skiff i carried water-proof
tarpaulins woolen blanket cooking outfit duffle



bag a box of grub etc i was abroad in august
and september and i think you are looking ahead to
the time of your life basing my judgment on my own
experiences

  if you want to live right outdoors go in a row-
boat carry with you ash hickory basswood or
other hoops and canvas to spread over the top of
your boat carry light anchor light line and
anchor in little bays or river mouths or drag your
boat up the beach out of the way of the waves

  sleep on board in a bunk made of heavy canvas
swung along both sides and by the ends to sides
and stem of boat swing it low but clear of the
bottom by three or four inches carry a little oil-
stove to cook under the canvas cover in rains-
which are not frequent

  write to outing magazine new york city field
and stream new york city forest and stream
new york city for book catalogs of skiff and boat
trips i wrote my experiences for a r harding
columbus ohio who got them out in book form
a trip on the great lakes which will help you
i think i dont know the price of the book
seventy-five cents or a dollar i think it tells what
i saw and what i did

  get the charts of lakes you want from u s lake
survey office detroit michigan

  if i were you i should go to chicago and look
along the water-front and boat liveries and dubs for
bargains in boats you could find a very good boat
via sears roebuck  co or montgomery ward 
co skiff or small motor-boat through motor
boating or motorboat get copies through news-
dealers good rowboat first hand  to 
if you got a  -foot rowboat and put in out-
board motor you would have ideal outfit but ive
rowed thousands of miles with oars

  get a  or  fishing license for ontario
waters from game overseers-important towns-
and visit customs office and obtain pleasure cruising
permit you would go up michigan across to
north shore along the soo-through canal-and
into north shore of superior

the red lake country

  question-i would like some information on
beltrami county minnesota the section around
red lake is this section thickly settled and how is
the hunting and fishing could i find a trappers
hut to stay at during the winter are there good
waterways so i could do most of the traveling by
canoe could i rely upon a rifle for a grub stake
or would the hunting and fishing be better around
the lake of the woods is there any trapping in
this section or is the best of the land covered-
chas haney olean n y

  answer by mr pinkerton-the country to the
south east and west of red lake is pretty well
settled while that to the north mostly a great
spruce swamp is being drained by the state and
government and settlers are coming in where it is
not drained there are stretches as big as a township
in which there is not a dry place big enough for a
tent in some places the rivers run under-
ground

  where settlers are not taking up the drained land
homesteaders arc taking claims for the pulp spruce
this is especially true around the big and little
fork rivers moreover north of red lake there
are still a number of indians and there is an indian
adventure



school on the lake between red lake and rainy
river there are some good stretches unsettled and
you can get into the country by canoe on the rapid
river though along the stream you will find
settlers

  there are deer moose bear and wolves in this
section the fisher skins are very good because of the
thick spruce growth you might be able to find a
deserted cabin in which to stay and undoubtedly
there is land to be trapped the old rules dont
hold there and it is the first man in near the
lake of the woods on the minnesota side the
country is quite thickly settled you most as-
suredly can not rely upon a rifle for a grub stake

birmingham alabama

  question-my husband has just signed a con-
tract as draftsman with a concern in birmingham
ala they tell him theres no malaria there and
people do not mind the heat although it rises to 
at times now we have two babies the oldest two
and a half years of age my health has not been the
best this winter and i hesitate about going there
with the children this spring please advse me
about the climate we are northern people
having lived for the past ten years in new york
state so are used to a cool climate

  also how about domestic life are the colored
people accepted as help by the whites in preference
to white servants my husband thinks i can get a
colored servant there cheaply have an electric fan
or two and thereby stand the heat this summer
is there electricity to be had there-mrs e w
barnhart emsworth pa

  answer by mr liebe-no two persons of
course will tell you the same things concerning the
healthfulness of any particular city here frankly
is what i think of birmingham

  i regard it a pretty good southern city as to
climate and about everything else mosquitoes
save in rare instances are not what we down here
think of as bad the draining of dead water
has worked wonders with the mosquito problem
and consequently with malaria in most such
southern cities the sanitation i understand is
good

  as to the thermometer rising to -that must
be a mistake the highest ever reported by the
weather bureau was but  the mean july
temperature of birmingham is but  degrees more
than that of pittsburgh people there most of
them do not think of it as an uncomfortably hot
place in summer however they are mostly
southern people while you are a northerner it
would be better if you could go down there in the
autumn if you go in the spring i advise you to go
as early as is possible you will consequently get
into the summer gradually

  yes negroes are generally accepted as the best
help in birmingham but it will be much to your
advantage to investigate a little when you hire a
negro woman demand references id say and then
do a little telephoning to make sure those refer-
ences are genuine handled just right negroes
make the very best servants in the world

  as to electricity yes they have it birmingham
is quite a city i fancy you will like the place a
good deal better than you now think

  i trust that you will not be disappointed in our
southland

central american opportunities

  question-are there any openings in any cen-
tral american country for young americans with the
united fruit co do they hire men in the u s as
checkers foremen etc who have no experience in
this line can you give me names and addresses of
parties with whom to file applications will they
pay fair salaries-j w robertson cedar park
tex

  answer by mr young-the united fruit co
has pretty much of a monopoly of the fruit industry
in central america and is by far the best company to
locate with they hire a great many of their men
down there-fellows who drift in-but they also
send young men down from here once in a while and
teach them the business after they arrive some of
the men in charge down there are as follows

  g m shaw manager guatemala division
puerto barrios guatemala v m cutter mana-
ger tela divn tela honduras r h goodell
manager u f co puerto cortez honduras w e
mullins manager c r divn san jos c r j m
kyes manager bocas divn u f co bocas del
toro panama

  you also might write c h ellis vice-pres

  the salaries are good ranging from s to 
and promotion is rapid provided a man stays sober
and works hard

mining in africa

  question-what chance lias a man to make a
stake in africa as mining foreman or some such
position i am familiar with all branches of mining
is there any placer-mining or any established con-
cerns is there much danger from fever etc i am
robust but have never been in the tropics what
arms and ammunition would be best to take along
for hunting-chas anderson houghton mich

  answer by mr miller-the chief mining dis-
trict of africa is the rand south africa a part of
the world i only know by reading and acquaintance
with men from there it is not tropical but a
temperate climate not unlike arizona the rough
labor is done by natives and imported indians and
chinese bossed by whites wages and living con-
ditions are good

  on the west coast with which i am more familiar
in a general way there is considerable gold mining
on the gold coast though someways inland and in
northern nigeria they are mining tin but no
placer-mining to my knowledge is done in africa
the wages on the west coast are good but the
country is unhealthy yet not so bad if one lives
temperately personally fever troubled me little
but that depends largely on the district it being
very unhealthy around the river deltas

  an experienced mining foreman would have no
trouble whatever in getting a good-paying job if he
can handle natives and theyre easy enough to
handle if one has handled men at all the usual
contract calls for three years with three months
notice either side to break it the companies pay
out-going passage and return passage if the three
years are carried out

  take only a shotgun there is a heavy license
on every gun a white takes through customs as the
authorities are very careful not to let the natives
lost trails



get hold of firearms you can easily pick up a
rifle or sporting gun from some fellow coming home

  i will hold this letter over a few days until i go up
to san francisco where i will get the names and
addresses of mining companies in africa and enclose
them you might write them stating briefly age
and experience two of my correspondents landed
african positions last month that way

gold in the southwest

  question-in what parts of arizona and old and
new mexico is gold to be found i would like to
prospect in the southern states is there any way
to get other work in the mines or the woods near
the gold area-lois pincher milwaukee wis

  answer by mr harriman-all three of the
places mentioned by you are highly mineralized but
you can not get across the border now so old mexico
may be left out of consideration copper is far
more generally found than gold in arizona but the
desert regions have many deposits of gold death
valley partly in this state has much it is a hor-
rible place to go oatman arizona near needles
has the largest producing gold-mine in the state
northwestern arizona is promising country for
prospectors as is southwestern and northern new
but you should have some man with you
who knows the country as it is arid and dangerous

  there is work among the mines in both states
you mention work in the woods near mining area
most of the mining is done where mesquile trees are
the biggest they find and they are scrubby little
things some few mines are found in forested sec-
tions but not the bulk of them you will find work
where they have ranches of various kinds

  there are known deposits of gold in large quan-
tities that are still unworked because of no water
within sixty miles that is the kind of country
you will traverse in prospecting desert hotter
than the old furnace into which the three israelites
were thrown drier than powder-mill or dry-kiln full
of alkali dust and whirlwinds me ill get my gold
in some other way thank you i am too amphibi-
ous to like desert for more than a week at a stretch

the south sea islands

  question-what race of people in habit the south
sea islands what are their customs history and
religion what opportunities do these islands offer
an adventurer what is the best and easiest way

there what money do you think necessary to
cover expenses is there any way to make money
while there what sort of an outfit is needed
where can i get a book and map of these islands-
raymond mossburg baltimore md

  answer by mr mills-there is much mystery
surrounding the whence of the south sea islanders
and ethnologists still dispute about it why should
i theorize where men on the spot cant agree some
say they are ancient malayans others that they
sprang from egypt im satisfied that they are a
fine race of south sea islanders for at least 
years thats far enough back surely

  their customs are various and pagan like their
religion - sun-worshipers cannibals offerers of
living sacrifices tremendously superstitious be-
lievers in evil spirits chaxms incantations and
strangely mixed in these later days with chris-
tianity for missionaries have done great work in the
islands during the past century whole islands such
as rarotonga and tonga becoming professing
christians

  their history i can not give you so far as the
islands are concerned adventures are to the adven-
turous plenty of sea-loom myriad islands differ-
ing peoples-surely there is the setting for adven-
ture the best way out to the islands for americans
is either from vancouver or san francisco whence
mail-boats and other craft go to honolulu which is
an ideal kicking-off place for the islands of which
there are numerous groups to choose from

  honolulu is a good place to get an outfit which
only means after all a tropical equipment of clothes
money just what sort of spender are you you
can get rid of as much cash in the islands as you can
in baltimore-and you can live cheaper in the
islands than in your own city it all depends on
whether you are a two-dollar-a-day man or upward
you can do the islands on five dollars a day
and of course money can make money as willingly
in the islands as in baltinore-with a maker be-
hind it

  but there must be patience to make money as a
trader or as a planter unfortunately the things
written about the islands arc not available in books
published in the u s a so far as i am aware as
soon as the war is over any shipping company trad-
ing to the islands will send you copies of their
pamphlets some of which arc instructive and in-
teresting but the censor has forbidden the circu-
lation of such just now

would the law let you marry

      when will the people of this country finally wake up to the fact that only by taking care of posterity can it
 becomc the greatest of all world forces there is much agitation all over the united states over the law of
 eugenics and some states have been wise enough to insist upon a medical examination of the two contracting
 parties to a marriage before a license is issued and although the propaganda of those at the head of this move-
 ment is perhaps not fully understood or appreciated there is no one who can conscientiously deny their
 sincerity or the ultimate good that would result

      through the adoption of a law whereby the physically unlit were barred from marriage in every state of the

 union there would indeed be a relatively small percentage of the popu-
 lation who would measure up to the standard

would you be one of those

 who were doomed to go through life alone without the joys and happiness that
 go hand in hand with a loving wife and strong healthy children would the
 fact that you have neglected your body ignored the fundamental principles of
 health and right living and failed to make the most of natures supreme gift
 doom you to a life of single wretchedness and unhappiness

       our first duty is to posterity we are not put here by an all-wise providence
 merely to live out our lives and then go out like a snuffed candle we are en-
 trusted with the sacred duty of perpetuating the species a duty which is as
 sacred and immutable as anything might well be

     like begets like is a saying handed down from time immemorial
 and no truer maxim has ever fallen from the lips of man a thin scraggy under-
 developed body soaked and saturated with poisons which are denied their proper
 outlet because of functional inefficiency cannot hope to produce strong healthy
 v children a man who is torn and wrecked by physical ailments organic disorders
 jh and excesses of all kinds will some day be treated to the spectacle of his children

		in a like condition on the other hand the strong healthy virile man with a

 body and constitution that is a replica of natures own design and who jealously
 safeguards that body and that health and takes the proper measures to gain and
 keep them will some day revel in the sight of offspring that are but a duplicate
 of himself-a picture of joyous bubbling care-free health and strength

	 so you see it is not only yourself to whom you owe a debt but to

all mankind

  and you owe it most to that girl

      the sweetest purest dearest girl in all the world whom you would call
 wife is your body clean strong and healthy do you realize the terrible
 consequences of the follies that are wrecking your body remember then that
 strongfortism will restore to you the vitality of manhood

      if you have any of the troubles mentioned on the consultation coupon
 below check up the subject in which you are interested and mail it to me today
 with your name and address written plainly thereon

      you have the same right to the splendid health virile manhood and
 superb body shown in the picture to the left that i have if you will obey
 nature if you will do the things i shall ask you to do you can make your
 body like mine  will show you how to obtain it

      in order to help you attain that degree of liodily strength and efficiency
 that is yours by gift of nature i invite you to write me regarding your present
 condition do not hesitate to state your case plainly and fully and no matter
 whether it is merely lack of proper development simple indigestion constipation
