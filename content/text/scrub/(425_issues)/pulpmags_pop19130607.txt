can be repointed and

the perfect tone-the tone you like the
best-is different with different selections

                           you will never be satisfied with any musical
instrument wrhich does not respond to your
individual tastes and requirements how many
times have you been actually irritated by hear-
ing music played too loud too fast too slow
too low or in some way which did not answer
your desire at the moment

  the only way you can be sure of having
                    your music exactly the way you want it is to
                    own an instrument which you can control at all
                    times to suit your varying desires

victor changeable needles enable you to exercise
this control to give any selection the exact tone you
wish and to make the instrument constantly adaptable
to your different moods and your varied demands for
musical entertainment in your home victor change-
able needles can thus be compared to the pedals of
the piano the stops of wind instruments or the
bowing of the violin

                contrast these advantages of the victor change-
able needle system with the old style fixed or un-
changeable point in other instruments where all
records must be played exactly alike and where there
is no possibility of changing the sound volume
or the tone quality

   because the victor
is always subject to
your complete con-
trol it gives you
more entertainment
more variety more
personal individual
satisfaction day in
and day out

  any victor dealer will gladly play any music you wish
to hear and demonstrate the value of the changeable
needle

the seal of confucius

by max surient

      author of   the secret of fort hoodoo  brothers in arms etc

      china may become a republic and adopt a modern constitution but the
    heart of its ancient mystery-like that of egypt-will ever remain a magnet
    to the imagination of man into that heart of forbidden sanctuaries cruelty
    and intrigue strange faith and sinister fanaticism surient takes us in this
    mesmeric novel of his as you plunge into the sweep and swing of the yellow
    maelstrom you feel at once that the author has a singular and intimate
    knowledge of the chinese character and cf the centurles-iong institutions
    even if that institution as in the present instance is nothing but a piece of
    jade no larger than an old-fashioned fob seal not only the lives of his hero
    and heroine but the destinies of the flowery kingdom depended upon the re-
    covery of that little jade talisman

a complete novel

chapter i

sternberg the american con-
sul gazed discontentedly over
the railing of the broad club
porch at the yellow water of the
sluggish river

  i suppose that i may get to like it
if i live here as long as you have stuck
it out uncle charley but just now im
not calling down blessings on the head
of our honored president for picking
out this particular plum as a reward
for my pernicious political activity in
aiding to turn the republican rascals
out he grumbled i wish that he
had seen fit to make me ambassador to
tophet

  oh i dont know chee nung isnt
so bad when you get acclimated an-
swered his companion a lean elderly
man who lounged comfortably in a long
ia

bamboo chair beside him seemingly ob-
livious to the heat and humidity which
had caused the consul so far to forget
his official dignity that he had discarded
collar and tie and sat unabashed with
his unbuttoned tunic of white duck re-
vealing that he wore only a singlet be-
neath it whats wrong beside the cli-
mate sternberg missionaries been
kickin up a bobbery

  no nothing more than usual re-
plied the consul i reckon that its
just the heat and a touch of liver and
-oh yes there is something bother-
ing me too say uncle charley
youve been out here so long that youre
the recognized walking whos who 
of every foreigner past and present
between vladivostok and manila so
you can surely help me out whos
macpherson

  why demanded the older man


the popuur magazine

with unaccustomed curtness as he
straightened up in his chair

  sternberg was so surprised at the ef-
fect of his question that he momen-
tarily forgot the heat and the large
palm-leaf fan with which he had un-
availingly been trying to mitigate his
discomfort dropped from his moist
hand winton familiarly known as
uncle charley in every foreign set-
tlement on the chinese littoral oldest
american resident of the flowery
kingdom and only surviving charter
member of the chee nung club was
ordinarily garrulous and a question of
identity or a disputed point of ancient
history which he could settle invariably
precipitated a flood of reminiscences
and anecdotes of the early days stern-
berg accordingly waited for a moment
unable to believe that the usual torrent
of information would not follow but
winton settled back in his chair and
remained silent his eyes fixed on the
glowing tip of his long manila che-
root

 confound you if you had re-
mained here to see that the club was
properly run and the tiffins fit to eat
instead of philandering about japan for
the past six weeks you wouldnt be sur-
prised at the question said the consul
when he became convinced that winton
would not answer its one the whole
settlement has been asking and the
womenfolks are so excited over it that
they are losing their beauty sleep-
which you know most of em cant af-
ford to do wtho is he anyway

  go on tell me whats been doing
here during my absence said winton
ignoring the repetition of the question
remember that i havent seen a soul
since i landed the boys had all ridden
off to miss washburns picnic at the
bubbling spring temple before my
boat got in

  and ill wager that they will all
forget the ordinary gossip of the set-
tlement and chatter of nothing but this
chap macpherson at that alfresco tea
fight grumbled sternberg id have
been out there myself instead of swel-
tering on this cussed porch if it hadnt
been for him-or rather for his brat

  go on repeated winton eagerly
as sternberg elevated his white-clad
feet to the porch railing

  the consul fuming at the thought of
the cool evening in the hills which the
others were enjoying and which he had
missed because of his official duties
was aggravatingly deliberate

 well you know about how much
intercourse there is between the mis-
sion stations and the settlement except
during the periodical scares of a na-
tive rising he said the elders
seem to think that the settlement is
inhabited by unregenerate sons of be-
lial-which is more or less true-and in
peaceful times even the settlement
youngsters and the sky pilots kids dont
forgather

  of course i know all about that
i havent lived forty years in china for
nothing exclaimed winton impatient-
ly as sternberg paused and mopped his
shining face with a grass-linen hand-
kerchief which in spite of its generous
proportions had been transformed into
a limp moist rag by similar applications
during the last hour

  yes but i doubt if you have ever
known of anything like this in all of
your vast experience of the country
he continued this morning young
astly-john wesley astly son of the
missionary-climbed into a chair and
had a couple of the mission coolies
carry him into the chinese city as
near as i could make out when they
were passing through one of the nar-
rowest streets the front bearer shoul-
dered outv of the way a youngster
dressed in the most ordinary of native
clothing-or rather he attempted to
instead of standing for it meekly as
they usually do and getting even by
spitting at the foreign devil in the chair
the youngster turned on him and with
unusual fluency told him what he
thought of his ancestors for a thousand
generations after the ancient and classi-
cal teaching of confucius then he
proceeded to emphasize his remarks by
sending a right to the point of the jaw
and a perfectly good left to the solar
plexus as practiced by professor john
lsullivan 
the seal of confucius



 young astly unaccustomed to
having his coolies assaulted by mere
natives got considerably wrought up
and as he wriggled from the overturned
chair he so far forgot he was a minis-
ters son that he used several expres-
sions in the vernacular which he never
learned in the mission kindergarten
and announced his intention of remov-
ing the yellow hide piecemeal from the
offender

  lesser incidents have led to mas-
sacres within my recollection com-
mented winton gravely the young
cub needs disciplining

  oh no he doesnt-he got plenty
answered sternberg chuckling the
chap whom he had announced his inten-
tion of flaying was about his own size
and he answered in perfectly good
english that he could lick the son of
any sky pilot that ever dealt out bibles
and free rations to rice christians
then he proceeded to demonstrate his
ability to make his words good and
he made a human punching bag of the
missionarys son until the other badly
scared chair coolie induced the soldiers
in the guardroom at the water gate to
come to his rescue but the original
cause of all the trouble proved to be
no chinaman but the macpherson boy
who had beetj strolling through chee
nung in native costume so they
brought them both before me at the
consulate

  the father is an american then
exclaimed winton relief very evident
in his tone

  sternberg shook his head im
blessed if i know what he is thats
why i asked the first question ive
never set eyes on him and the boy
wasnt communicative on that point i
assumed that he was and the kid didnt
raise any question as to my jurisdic-
tion although he seemed perfectly fa-
miliar with the procedure of the extra
territorial administration of justice i
did not take any action for i didnt
want to make a bobbery over a boyish
scrap before natives in spite of the fact
that the reverend astly appeared at
the consulate breathing an unusual
amount of fire and brimstone

  see here sternberg let me get at
the rights of this thing interrupted
winton impatiently commence at
the beginning cant you so that i can
get a lucid idea of why an american
boy should be masquerading in that
filthy hole in native costume

  dont get all het up uncle char-
ley its bad for the liver at this sea-
son answered sternberg soothingly
i defy you to make anything lucid out
of this business-anyway no one else
has been able to the beginning so far
as i know was about three weeks ago
when a comprador by the name of
wong tom came up from the coast
and announced that he was looking for
a house in the settlement for his em-
ployer-name of macpherson it was
essential that the place should be on the
river so some one sent him to me--
you know that mrs farley left the dis-
posal of the bungalow to me when she
went home after poor tom went out

  wanton nodded assent and sternberg
went on well the comprador
seemed more interested in the condi-
tion of the landing stage and the com-
pound walls than the domestic arrange-
ments of the house which was mighty
lucky for mrs farley he pungled up
the full purchase price in american
yellowbacks and gave me a memoran-
dum that the deed was to be made to
richard macpherson

  yes that was the name-she called
him dick said winton absently and
half to himself and then leaning for-
ward in his chair he looked expectantly
at the consul go ahead sternberg
lets have the sequel what is this chap
macpherson like  he demanded
eagerly

  thats just what every one in the
settlement would like to know but no
one has set eyes on him and i dont
even know whether he is here or not
answered the consul wong tom took
immediate possession hustled in a big
gang of workmen to make some altera-
tions and repairs and when they had
finished he locked the front gate its
remained locked too so far as any one
knows to the contrary

  a week ago to-night just as the


the popular magazine

whole bachelor bunch was gathered out
here on the porch for a good-night peg
we heard the chugging of an engine
down riverside the water was at
full flood then for there had been
heavy rains in the hills all the week
before and the boat was evidently mak-
ing heavy going against the current
pretty soon we saw the reason for it
for while the steam launch which hove
in sight wras built more on the lines of
a racer than a tug she was towing a
couple of heavy sampans none of the
crowd had ever seen the launch before
and you can imagine that it created ex-
citement and caused a lot of guessing

  winton nodded yes i know the
crowd he assented dryly it was no
fools job to navigate a launch with a
tail like that on the old yesat kiang
running in flood

  then there was no fool running
her for he brought those sampans
alongside the bungalow landing stage
as easily and quietly as a liverpool cap-
tain docks a liner continued stern-
berg

  winton rose from his chair and
walking to the railing looked up the
river

  there are not a half dozen natives
on the river who could do it even with
the current as sluggish as it is now no
not three he said thoughtfully lets
see-the moon must have been even
brighter a week ago

  yes it was a perfectly clear night
and we could see the whole thing pretty
plainly answered the consul not
plain enough to satisfy tommy marsh
though you know what an infernal
little rubberneck he is

  his shortage of brains and excess
of curiosity have kept him in trouble
ever since he came out agreed win-
ton  what happened 

  well he got a bad case of fidgets
for fear he might miss something so
he went down to the club landing stage
and routed out a couple of sampan
boys they rowed the sampan with
tommy as a passenger up to within
hailing distance of the launch and
tommy was just about to get off one
of his brilliant witticisms like welcome

to our fair city when the launch hailed
first tommy isnt strong on the ver-
nacular and he didnt understand what
was said but it took immediate effect
on the boys they didnt rest on their
oars they just dropped em as if they
had been red-hot and went overboard
like mud turtles sliding off a log leav-
ing tommy adrift on the yesat in flood
in a clumsy sampan that no one but a
heathen chinee could navigate

  well said winton interrogatively
as the consul paused and chuckled

  tommy got back to the club in time
for breakfast-just-and neither his
appearance nor language was fit for
publication continued sternberg a
friendly eddy had finally enabled him
to get the sampan to the edge of a mud
flat about ten miles below the baptist
compound he wanted me to ask the
mandarins to have the coolies bastina-
doed  but they swore that it was all
an accident-that they had just hap-
pened to fall overboard and that they
had heard no hail from the launch

  ill talk to em later said winton
grimly whats the rest of the story 

  mighty little so far as i know
answered sternberg the launch
waited at the landing stage only a half
hour and then went downstream as si-
lently as a white ghost and a good
twelve knots faster than the current
the sampans must have floated off dur-
ing the night at any rate they had dis-
appeared in the morning a small army
of coolies was busy unloading them and
carrying stuff up to the bungalow
when i turned in tommy marsh told
me that a young chap evidently a
foreigner was standing on the landing
stage bossing the job and that he
saw a half dozen women walking up
the pier to the house

  white or native asked winton
sharply

  he wasnt close enough to see but
he assumed the latter replied stern-
berg hes probably right for white
women wouldnt stay cooped up in the
compound walls and no one else has
caught sight of them in fact wong
tom and the boy are the only ones
who ever leave it the morning after
the seal of confucius



the arrival of the launch the compra-
dor bought a couple of priestlys best
ponies-he knows a horse and even
priestly couldnt fool him-and since
then the youngster has spent a lot of
time in galloping around the country
he never draws rein until he is out-
side of the concession limits though
and no foreigner has heard him speak
until he told young astly what he was
going to do to him he wasnt com-
municative with me when he was
brought to the consulate just an-
nounced that he was willing to pay any
fine i might impose i asked him when
he expected his father and he an-
swered that he didnt expect him his
tone implying that it was none of my
business thats the full bag of tricks
so far as i know it uncle charley
now perhaps you will answer my ques-
tion who is macpherson

  wait a minute sternberg how old
is this boy asked winton after a
little hesitation

  fourteen or fifteen i should eay
and rather uncommonly developed for
his age he knocked that coolie out
stiff and although young astley is a
good two years older and a husky
youngster too he thrashed him to a
fare you well

  not a half-caste then they never
have stamina

  no straight caucasian there can
be no doubt of that said sternberg
positively but see here uncle char-
ley im tired of the witness box and
i wish that youd take my place who
the deuce is this chap macpherson any-
way 

  again winton hesitated as a man
might before plunging into icy water
and before speaking a mutilated left
hand from which three fingers were
missing was raised unconsciously to his
chin where a white imperial imperfect-
ly concealed a livid scar

  sternberg thats a question which
i asked a good many times until i
gave it up as a bad job about fifteen
years ago he said and the consul
felt that winton was speaking with the
greatest reluctance of a subject which
brought up the most painful memories

my long residence in china hasnt
been without its little excitements ive
stood three sieges by the chinese mob
and ive seen a whole lot of things
which i dont care to recall the last
years have been quiet and untroubled
ones except for the ghosts of the past
for its fifteen years since i went
through the worst of all and lost these
fingers and won this scar on my chin
i have always believed that i was the
sole survivor of the lang tun mas-
sacre

  sternberg straightened up like a man
who has received a galvanic shock for-
getting the heat his perplexities and
everything but the man before him it
had been long before his time but the
mere mention of lang tun was enough
to make even a brave man shudder

  but i have always understood that
there was not a single christian sur-
vivor he stammered as soon as he
could find speech

  winton shrugged his shoulders

  perhaps i am not a christian--the
missionaries all say im not he said
grimly in any case i am a survivor
although for many a long painful day
and horrible sleepless night i wished
there had been none-that i had shared
the most painful of the deaths as i
did a part of the fiendish tortures
which were meted out to the others
i have kept my share in that awful
business a profound secret sternberg
this is the first time that i have ever
mentioned it to a living soul i wanted
to forget it and not be reminded of
it by idle questioning through all
these years i have never been able to
guess why i was spared but now i be
gin to suspect as one sees through a
glass dimly i find the clew in what
you have told me to-night

  he leaned forward in his chair and
even in the moonlight sternberg could
see that the usual ruddy color had left
his face it was set and stern and his
eyes were fairly blazing and when he
spoke his voice trembled with emotion

  sternberg if your richard mac-
pherson is my dick macpherson i was
not the sole survivor for my dick mac-
pherson was at lang tun he said


the popular magazine

god help me-i cant believe its true
but if he is the same and this fifteen-
year-old boy is his son and a cau-
casian there must have been still an-
other-a woman

  pray heaven there was exclaimed
sternberg with a shudder i know
little enough and yet almost too much
of the details of that tragedy uncle
charley one of my predecessors in-
vestigated it and in going through the
archives the other day i stumbled across
a copy of his confidential report to the
secretary of state i only glanced
through it for i felt that if i read it
i should take my revolvers and run
amuck in the native city but i saw
enough to make me hope that you are
right-that at least one woman was
spared

   call  man happy until he is
dead  quoted winton gravely death
-even a painful one-is not the worst
thing which can come to a man and
as for a woman- he stopped ab-
ruptly and for a long time the two
men sat silent in the moonlight win-
ton apparently lost in bitter memories
of the past sternberg consumed with
curiosity but too considerate to ask
that it be allayed at the cost of an-
others pain it was winton who final-
ly broke that silence and there was a
strange tenderness in his voice when
he spoke

  even now after fifteen years i
cannot bring myself to speak of the
last days of lang tun and it would
serve no useful end in any case he said
quietly i was there only a very brief
time before it all happened-business
at the little trading station the pretext
a girl at the mission the real reason for
my having made that awful journey
from the coast to the interior dont
think that im too much of an old fool
sternberg remember that it was fifteen
years ago and each one of those years
since has counted double with me i
was returning from a business trip to
the states as i thought to wind up my
affairs out here and go back perma-
nently and we were fellow passengers
on the old china from frisco to hong-
kong

  never mind her name and dont
try to picture her from the women at
the stations here now lang tun and
the many minor tragedies have at last
taught them a little of wisdom at home
and they dont send quite such tender
sacrifices to the heathen as they did
then she was a young girl from a
small new england village and had
about as much idea of the life which
was really before her as she had ex-
perience of the world to fit her to swim
safely with the lot of fish which made
up the cabin list of the old china she
was traveling alone in the captains
care of course but so was the ship
and you can imagine which came first
with him macpherson was also a pas-
senger and while most of the unat-
tached men on board were in love with
her before the long voyage was over
it was evident that none of the rest of
us had a chance  he was the only one
to whom she gave a second thought

  the man was a complete mystery
to us he was a good mixer in the
smoke room after the womenfolks had
ttirned in and he seemed to have had
a broad experience of the world to
have been everywhere and to have seen
everything but he never spoke of his
home nor his family and none of us
was even sure of his nationality his
english was perfect although there was
at times a little burr to his pronuncia-
tion  and desieux the french consul
at kobe told me that his french was
parisian i am sure that he wasnt an
american though in spite of the boy
having acknowledged your jurisdic-
tion

  he didnt acknowledge anything he
simply raised no question but never
mind him now said sternberg
please go on uncle charley

  there isnt much to go on with in
that part of it for i dont know much
more about him now than i did then
continued winton it isnt easy to get
to lang tun even now fifteen years
ago the journey was a terror and the
girl had to wait more than a month in
hongkong until opportunity offered for
safe escort macpherson stayed there
too living at the club where some one
the seal of confucius



had put- him up but so far as i know
no one ever learned any more about
him than we had found out on the
steamer i happen to know that the
missionary bunch in hongkong wtas
mightily relieved when the time came
that she could be sent on however and
her almost constant association with
him gained their stern disapproval

  it was apparent that her experience
in the steamer and her month in the
cosmopolitan life of hongkong had
opened her eyes and broadened her vi-
sion a bit and she didnt seem quite
so unworldly-wise nor so keen about
devoting her young life to the conver-
sion of our yellow brothers as she did
when she left her native village i
think that they were afraid that she
would fall from grace and throw up
her job for the fleshpots and when i
saw her saying good-by to macpherson
i knew that it had been a narrow
squeak that didnt make me entirely
happy although i had seen a good deal
of him since we landed and had grown
to like the chap and then within a
week after her departure i didnt know
whether to be glad that she had gone
and left him or sorry that she hadnt
chucked the missionary pidgin and re-
mained to keep him straight

  winton stopped speaking and stern-
berg watched him impatiently as with
great deliberation he lighted a fresh
cheroot and inhaled the strong acrid
smoke

  drink he suggested as a prompter
might give a forgotten clew

  no no more than the average new
arrival puts away at the hongkong
club answered winton slowly you
know that there are fifty-seven different
varieties of roads which a man can fol-
low to the demnition bowwows out
here in the east in my observation
ive seen every one of them traveled
more than once-with the same inevi-
table ending to the best of my knowl-
edge macpherson never more than ten-
tatively set foot on any one of those
well-trodden paths but he seemed to
be heading for the same destination
fast enough even now-and ive
thought over everything connected with

him time and again during these years
-i cant put my finger on a single
definite thing for whatever he was up
to was done away from us he would
most mysteriously disappear for days
at a time and when he turned up again
he looked like a man who had been
seeing things but i know that it wasnt
drink

  at first i suspected opium but there
were none of the symptoms which we
so soon learn to look for out here in
evidence there was none of the in-
evitable gossiping and thinly veiled
contemptuous familiarity on the part of
the chinese club servants which inevi-
tably betray that a foreigner is going
native-which is about the worst thing
that can happen to a white man-al-
though he had certainly accumulated
the choicest and most variegated lot of
chinese acquaintances which i have
ever known a newcomer to acquire in
so short a time he seemed to have
at least a bowing acquaintance with
every river pirate fan-tan gambler and
hop smuggler in the native quarter and
at the same time he was persona grata
with all the fat bonzes at the temples

  i cant tell you what it was the
change was indefinable but it was not
for the better and i could hardly rec-
ognize him as the same man i had seen
riding with the girl six weeks before

  when he returned to the club after
his mysterious absences he always
seemed to be sort of dazed and acted
as if he were in strange and unaccus-
tomed surroundings for a time  but that
soon wore off and he again became
normal and european to his finger tips
we had simply been casual traveling
companions and his actions were none
of my business but it all made me feel
mighty sorry for the girl at that lonely
mission station-so sorry that i never
hesitated when her appeal for help
came

  winton paused in his recital and
looked wistfully out over the river and
sternberg tactfully remained silent he
knew that winton would go on at his
own good time-that he was debating
with himself as to how much he had
a right to tell


the popular magazine

  it was a pitiful little appeal he
continued apparently satisfied in his
mind that sternberg was a safe confi-
dant it had been ten days on the
way although the bearer had evidently
traveled hard and when he opened his
wallet to get it for me i saw that he
carried another chit which was ad-
dressed to macpherson to me she
wrote that her need was urgent that
she had tried to communicate with
macpherson but had received no reply
to the three messages which she had
sent to him there was nothing which
hinted at distrust of him she feared
only that he might be dead or too ill
to come to her she begged of me to
find him if he were living to come to
her myself if he were dead

  well only that day macpherson had
made one of his mysterious exits from
the ken of european hongkong and
no one knew where he wras or when
he might return i spent the night
searching for him but in vain so
without confiding my real destination
to any one i left for lang tun at day-
light remember sternberg i was fif-
teen years younger then as the calen-
dar counts time and a good bit more as
mens lives go

  if you live to be a thousand youll
not be too old to answer a distress sig-
nal uncle charley ive heard tales
of you of what you did for the ken-
ningtons of your risking life and for-
tune for--

  winton quickly interrupted him
you mustnt believe all you hear and
only about ten per cent of what you
see in china he protested no de-
cent man could have disregarded that
one anyway i left her chit to mac-
pherson with my comprador to be de-
livered as soon as he reappeared but i
felt that her fears were more than jus-
tified-that he was worse than dead to
her

  let me tell you that was one aw-
ful trip i knew the ropes and spent
money like a drunken sailor and i
made it in a week clipping three days
off the record of the native runners
you know what lang tun was before
the tragedy-a walled native city of a

half million or so a half dozen traders
who carried on their business in de-
fiance of treaties by standing for a lib-
eral squeeze to the viceroy

  there had never been a suspicion of
antiforeign feeling among the natives
and the missionaries had neglected the
most ordinary precautions in the ar-
rangement of their buildings and the
protection of the compound naturally
i went first to the tiny settlement the
chaps there were equally unprepared
for trouble if it should come but there
was one saving grace-there were no
white women there the fellows all
lived in a little group of bungalows in
one large compound and messed at the
tiny club

  well when i visited the mission i
found that the girl had not exagger-
ated things  her need was surely urgent
i had the whole pitiful story from the
head of the mission before i saw her
he was entirely reasonable and begged
of me to try to influence her to meet
their wishes-to return quietly to her
own people he told me that they were
all heartbroken over the miserable busi-
ness more especially at the girls prac-
tical defiance of them

  she would make no admission of
wrongdoing and absolutely refused to
be guided by their advice she ac-
knowledged their right to cast her out
from the mission but she resolutely
defied them to make her leave china
and asserted that macpherson would
surely come and then everything would
be made right it was evidently a bad
business sternberg and i couldnt see
that my coming would make it much
better i cant tell you how i dreaded
that interview for i felt that if i told
the truth-which was the only thing i
could do-it would be small comfort to
her but i might have spared myself
that anticipation of discomfort dyna-
mite couldnt have shaken her faith in
him and my careful planning of a gen-
tle way of conveying the truth was
wasted if he was alive he would come
as soon as he received the chit which
i had insured would reach his hands
the other messages must have miscar-
ried  that was all there was to it
the seal of confucius



  well the club was primitive and
without many comforts but i was
mighty glad to get back to it the at-
mosphere of the mission had been de-
pressing their trouble was a deep one
the confidence of the girl had been al-
most contagious but she had not seen
the man as i had seen him and i found
myself wishing that she never might
there is no use in making bones about
it i had loved the girl and as i thought
over those last few weeks i realized
that the earth was not large enough to
hold macpherson and myself and
then just as i had formulated that
thought in my mind the man himself
threw himself from the saddle of a
half-dead horse at the very door of the
club

chapter ii

  naturally my first feeling was one
of great relief for his coming seemed
in a measure to justify the girls faith
in him continued winton after a
pause which to sternberg seemed in-
terminable i believed he had re-
ceived the message which i left for him
at hongkong and it had caused him to
follow close on my heels but he was
haggard and worn and when he looked
straight at me without showing the
slightest sign of recognition i realized
that he was in that same condition of
semitrance which had always marked
his reappearance at the hongkong club
but he seemed even more stupefied than
i had ever seen him there

  opium suggested sternberg but
winton shook his head emphatically

  not even a suggestion of it he an-
swered he seemed to have been
transformed into an automaton and i
knew from the attitude of the club
servants that he was an entire stranger
to them that he had not previously vis-
ited the club

  from former experience i judged
that he would soon come out of it and
be himself but i was mighty sure
that he was in no condition to do any-
body any good by going to the mission
as he was he offered no objection
when i led him into the house and into
the bedroom which had been placed at

my disposal five minutes later he was
stretched out on the bed dead to the
world slumbering as peacefully as a
child

  fortunately the club was deserted
when he arrived the fellows were all
at their offices or godowns when they
returned they were naturally very cu-
rious but i lied like a coolie before a
mandarin and saved macpherson from
being awakened even when dinner time
came round there was no sign of life
from him and after dinner we sat down
for the inevitable whist it must have
been eleven oclock before anything
happened and then macpherson sud-
denly appeared unannounced in the
doorway of the cardroom he was ap-
parently himself again-at least there
was none of the bewilderment and va-
cancy which had been in his face be-
fore  but when he spoke i believed that
he had gone stark staring mad

   are you men fools or crazy that
you sit playing cards when the country
is up about you he exclaimed for
gods sake help me if you wont help
yourselves i must get to lang tun
and im lost

   take it easy old man and like-
wise take a peg answered creighton
the englishman who was practically
the club father soothingly as he clapped
his hands to summon a boy the sun
was devilish hot to-day and you must-
have had a tough ride bad thing-
this chinese sun until you get salted to
it and-

   but this place will be a shambles
in an hour you fool interrupted mac-
pherson furiously are you all deaf
as well as mad cant you hear the
brutes raging

  creighton was a level-headed chap
and he didnt fly off the handle but re-
lieved his feelings by again clapping his
hands for the dilatory boy macpher-
son seemed to be hearing something
which was entirely inaudible to us and
i knew that they all believed he was
mad and suffering from hallucinations
of hearing it was very evidently real
enough to him for the man was in ab-
ject terror but not the terror of per-
sonal cowardice if you can understand


the popular magazine

what i mean he stared wildly about
the room until his eyes met mine and
then a cry of relief came from his
lips

   winton you here he said
thank god for that tell these men
that i am not crazy i tell you the
country is rising listen and you can
hear the burn and kill and you
know what that means i must get to
the lang tun mission station winton
-for gods sake help me

   steady mac i answered trying
to humor him its only a step but
we cant go there at this time of night
ill go with you the first thing in the
morning

  creighton annoyed that there had
been no answer to his summons had
stepped into the hallway to call a serv-
ant and as i finished speaking he came
back into the room there was a cu-
rious expression on his face and he
looked sharply at macpherson with
troubled eyes

   fellows there is something wrong
he said quietly there isnt a servant
left about the club

  for a moment there was absolute
silence in the room and then with a
round teutonic oath kounz the ger-
man tea buyer jumped from his chair
and threw open the bamboo lattice
which screened the window it was
a black night but outside there was
no disquieting sound the stillness was
so profound that in our keyed-up con-
dition it seemed ominous it was bro-
ken by macpherson whose voice was
uncanny as he repeated over and over
that burn and kill burn and kill
which was audible to him alone

  youve never heard that cry stern-
berg and pray heaven you never will
its the slogan of the mob when anti-
foreign pidgin is toward there could
be no doubt of macphersons sincerity
and in spite of the evidence of our
senses that he was suffering from a
hallucination it made us all nervous
for the desertion of the club servants
was disquieting bill lennie a raw-
boned scotchman who had lived in
china long enough to read the signs
and know his way about had slipped

from the room at the first announce-
ment and just as kounz turned from
the window with the assurance that
there was not a sign of anything un-
usual in the native city lennie came
back in his hand a revolver which he
was stuffing with cartridges

  boys the mon is fey he ex-
claimed full well i ken the mac-
phersons and they have the gift or the
curse of it in the blood ive been to
my diggings and theyre stripped as
clean as a hoftnds tooth i hae me
doots that therell be a saxpence left in
the compound

  there could be no further question
of impending trouble rats desert a
sinking ship and the chinese servants
had been forehanded not one of them
remained in the compound and the fact
that they had dared to loot before de-
serting was sufficient indication that
they believed their masters would never
be in a position to exact retribution
but most serious of all a hasty search
revealed that they had stolen all of the
arms save of course the revolvers
which we all carried

  creighton by right of seniority as-
sumed the leadership macpherson
what do you really know of this is
there a general rising he demanded
sharply why in heavens name didnt
you warn us when you first came in-
stead of waiting until-

   when i first came how long
have i been here interrupted mac-
pherson there was a curious expres-
sion of perplexity on his face and he
passed his hand over his forehead as if
he were brushing something away

  creighton turned an inquiring
glance to me but i shook my head i
could make no more of it than he could
i could see that macpherson was com-
ing out of that strange condition which
lennie had described as fey and the
terror had left his eyes but they were
curiously bewildered and helpless as he
fixed them on me

   i cant see that we can make things
better by talking he said ignoring the
question of creighton to whom he
seemed to have taken a violent dislike
winton will you come with me to the

lang tun mission station-to my
wife 

  well perhaps it will strain your
credulity sternberg but for a moment
i forgot our peril-that we were prac-
tically defenseless and six hundred
miles from help his last word had
lifted such a weight from my heart
that nothing else seemed to matter
had there been no threat of danger
which made it imperative i should still
have taken him there even at that hour
that he might proclaim what the girl
for some reason which i could not
guess had hidden from the world

  it was not a time however to think
of individuals and of course there was
no necessity for answering his question
every man was on his feet and anxious
to be gone for there was but one course
open to us-to reach the mission station
before the storm broke and cut us off
it was creighton who gave the word
and even as we filed from the card-
room the silence without was broken
and a curious buzzing and droning
came in through the window at which
kounz had listened from the chinese
city

  by the time we reached the open
air that droning had increased to a con-
fused murmuring so quickly does pas-
sion fatten on itself with the chinese
mob a murmuring which was punc-
tuated now and then with a staccato
cry-that peculiar falsetto which in the
east always means mischief-while
here and there patches of light betrayed
he torches of assembling crowds and
then as we hurried through the dark-
ness toward the mission we heard that
cry of which macphersons hallucina-
tion had given such strange premonition
-the burn and kill which told us
that our worst fears were realized

  as we had expected we brought the
first news of trouble to the mission-
news which was as unexpected as a
thunderbolt from a clear sky and for
which-god help them -they were ab-
solutely unprepared

  the mission buildings were substan-
tial-mst of them with thick walls of
brick-but they were scattered all over
the great compound had there been

sufficient warning the poor creatures
might have concentrated in one build-
ing and have held out for a time but
the storm burst almost at our heels as
we gained entrance to the compound

  straight as an arrow from a bow
macpherson had made for the mission
hospital where i had told him his wife
was quartered i had meant to stick
to him but i saw that the native con-
verts had turned traitors and were pre-
paring to open the flimsy gates which
might have hindered the advance of the
mob long enough to allow of a measure
of concentration creighton and i tried
to drive them back while the others ran
to spread the alarm but there were too
many of them for two men to hold and
there was nothing for us to do but to
seek the nearest shelter which hap-
pened to be the very solidly built chapel
perhaps a dozen of the mission people
were already there-men women and
children-and kounz the big german
staggered in just before we closed the
heavy door an unconscious white
woman on his shoulder a new-born
baby under his arm

  winton abruptly stopped his recital
and clapped his hands

  ill have a drink before i go on with
this sternberg i need it he said
huskily

  the consuls eyes were fixed on the
doorway and he gave a sigh of relief
when an alert boy answered the sum-
mons

  id have had a nervous chill if he
had delayed a minute longer he said
after they had given their orders its
a creepy business uncle charley when
you think of that chinese city yonder
and our distance from the coast

  yes theres not a night passes that
i do not dream that i hear the terrible
slogan and see the mob pouring
through its gates assented winton
but dont worry old man im not
going to give you food for nightmares
by piling on the horrors they were
there all right and i missed none of
them for the chapel was the last build-
ing to fall for six days we held out
-or rather we watched and waited
because the mob realized that it was se-

cure from interruption and had plenty
of time and they went at it methodi-
cally taking the buildings one by one

  the mission hospital was the first
point of attack and as it had been
built with no thought of defense but
to afford all of the light and ventilation
possible the mob swept through it
about as easily as it would have
marched through an open field i saw
men and women dragged out and al-
though i thought i could distinguish
both macpherson and the girl whose
plea had brought me to lang tun i
was never sure of their identity it
wasnt the sort of thing which one
cared to watch too closely although the
brutes soon remembered that they could
make us suffer in anticipation and
seemed to delight in exhibiting their
methods to those who were not yet in
their hands

  the men who were with us in the
chapel went fairly mad as they watched
the devils work going on it was bad
enough for us but the poor wretches
in the hands of those fiends incarnate
were their coworkers their friends and
in many cases their close relatives
kounz creighton and i fought them
back from tearing away the barricades
of the door and rushing out to certain
destruction in vain attempts at rescue
but in their madness they wasted their
small store of ammunition so- that when
the final rush came there were only our
three revolvers and none of us had
extra cartridges

  of course i knew that there was
no hope but i had been treasuring those
cartridges and when our turn came
every one of them told i killed five

men and then-- winton stopped

and took a long pull at the tall glass
which the boy had silently brought

  what was her name asked stern-
berg softly and there was a little catch
in wintons voice as he answered

  martha-that was the only one i
ever knew i have never tried to find
out he said all along i had planned
to save that last cartridge for myself
but as the door went down she stretched
out her hand and there was no resist-
ing the appeal in her eyes she wasnt

more than nineteen or twenty years old
thank god she died with a smile on
her lips and the memory of that helped
a little during the next few days

  there is no use in going into the
details of what happened to me after
that i suppose you know that a good
many of the prisoners were dragged off
to make sport in the neighboring vil-
lages  but for twenty-four hours those
yellow devils exercised their ingenuity
on me right there in the ruins of the
mission station  i have never been able
to figure out how i happened to last
so long nor why they stopped just short
of finishing me i have only a dim rec-
ollection of the last of it and of the
appearance on the scene of a fat old
bonze accompanied by the boy who had
waited upon me at the lang tun club
it was that boy who recognized me
after they had spent a long time in
examining what was left of some of
the others and the bonze who spoke
with authority raised a bobbery and
interrupted the slicing process which
they were just about to start with me

  i couldnt understand the dialect of
that part of the country very well but
the coolies who had been torturing me
began quarreling among themselves
and i could just make out that some
of them questioned his right to inter-
fere saying that i was the last one and
that it would be better to make a clean
sweep of the foreign devils three
words from the bonze settled it how-
ever and a couple of the largest coolies
picked me up and  carried me away
how far i dont know for mercifully i
became unconscious

  when i came to myself i found
that my wounds had been carefully
dressed and i must have been liberally
dosed with opium for i did not suffer
particularly i was evidently a pris-
oner though confined in a sort of cage
of bamboo strange faces were about
me but i was not treated unkindly and
slowly i began to take interest in life
again i had lost all track of time but
figuring back afterward i judged that
my imprisonment must have lasted
about ten weeks before that fat old
bonze again visited me
the seal of confucius



  its a queer country this china and
the longer i live in it the less i feel
that i really know of it of the things
which go on beneath the surface which
foreigners see certainly nothing in my
previous experience had prepared me
for what happened after that and to
tell the truth i have never been sure
of just what did happen they must
have doped me in my food that day
and kept me doped for a long time i
have only a dim and confused memory
of being carried in a hammock over
range after range of hills and through
countless villages then a long peace-
ful journey by water and i slowly came
back to myself in surroundings which
seemed vaguely familiar one by one
i identified objects which i had never
expected to see again but it was not
until my own boy the man who had
been my personal servant for a dozen
years stood beside my bed offering me
a letter that i could believe that i was
really back in my old quarters in hong-
kong i eagerly broke the seals of the
silk strings which protected the con-
tents but inside was a single sheet of
parchment and inscribed on it was a
quotation from confucius

  to accept gratefully and without ques-
tioning a gift however humble is to exer-
cise the ever-to-be-honored and observed
courtesy through which we acquire merit

  it was a plain hint and one glance
at the placid and imperturbable face of
the boy convinced me that it would be
wise to take it for i should gain noth-
ing by questioning any native

  well when i got about i found
that the lang tun affair was three
months old and practically a closed in-
cident the mandarins had gone up
with the troops and virtually razed the
city exacting a heavy toll in heads and
imposing crushing taxes to supply the
indemnities no one knew that char-
ley winton had ever been within a hun-
dred miles of the place for not one of
the chaps from the club nor a soul from
the mission survived to tell the story
ask any of the old-timers at the hong-
kong club about me and theyll tell you
that uncle charley isnt the man he
used to be you should have known him

before he was pretty nearly bowled
over by that fool hunting trip in the
north country which he made fifteen
years or so ago 

  he rose from his chair as he finished
his recital and walking to the rail
leaned against one of the pillars of
cunningly joined bamboo which sup-
ported the roof gazing thoughtfully up
the river to where the landing stage of
the farley bungalow lay deserted in
the bright moonlight

  looking at the clear-cut profile and
the outline of the slender youthful fig-
ure sternberg could hardly believe that
the man before him was nearing his
sixtieth year and that since he came
out as a lad of eighteen a cadet in the
service of one of the old new england
trading companies he had lived almost
continuously in china where foreign-
ers ordinarily die or degenerate before
the end of the second decade unless by
frequent and long visits to the west
they keep in touch with occidental civi-
lization

  winton was as alert and active as
a youngster as careful of his dress and
personal appearance as a beau brum-
mel

  thinking of what the man had en-
dured uncomplainingly sternberg be-
came uncomfortably conscious of the
habit of slovenliness into which he was
allowing himself to drift and rising
from his chair he buttoned his tunic
mumbling an apology for the absence
of his collar and tie as he joined the
older man at the railing

  you have always been a wonder to
me uncle charley and now the won-
der grows he said as he shook and
smoothed his disordered clothing into
the best shape he could i know that
every other foreigner in the settlement
-and i suspect a large proportion of
those at the mission stations-remains
here from strictly meal-ticket consider-
ations and looks forward eagerly to
the day when he will have accumulated
enough of a pile or earned a pension
to live on at home you made yours
long ago and i have often wondered
why you dont get back while you are
young enough to enjoy what the west


the popular magazine

can offer after what you have told
me to-night i wonder still more for
i should think you would loathe china
and all things chinese

  winton smiled and shrugged his
shoulders

  you may be putting the cart before
the horse sternberg he answered
slowly you are correct in one thing
-i could have retired with more than
a competence a score of years ago and
since then i have piled up a fortune
which i do not need-a large one as
those things are reckoned out here
perhaps after forty years i have
formed the habit of china and cant
shake it off its the deuce of a thing
to get into your blood i have often
thought of going back home but it
would not mean much to me after all
these years ive lost touch sternberg
and then-

  he stopped abruptly and pointed to
the landing stage a figure had
emerged from the shadows of the thick
shrubbery on the shore and as it came
into the bright moonlight they could
distinguish that it was that of a man
in native dress he made no effort at
concealment but walked to the edge
and stood with his face toward them
gazing downstream

  its the macpherson boy said the
consul as the moonlight revealed the
contour of his face

  winton stared at him as one fasci-
nated

  then dick macpherson survived
lang tun he exclaimed its a
pocket edition of the man i knew
theres the answer-or a part of it-
to all of- your conjectures about me
sternberg fifteen years ago as you
have surmised i was filled with hatred
and loathing of china and all things
chinese i was rich enough then to
satisfy any reasonable man and not too
old to return home and renew old asso-
ciations and friendships i tried the
experiment sternberg and i stayed in
america just three months i cant tell
you what it is but the east is un-
canny it had gotten a hold on some-
thing inside me and there was no fight-
ing against it that three months was

almost as bad as their predecessors
which i had spent in a bamboo cage
and i gave it up and returned to the
old life

  until to-night i never realized what
it was but now i know there was
work for me to do here sternberg-
something i know not what which had
its inception at lang tun perhaps
those fifteen years of idleness have been
wasted perhaps they have been only a
needful preparation for what lay be-
fore me in all that time there has
been nothing tangible in my mind but
as the steamer carried me up the river
to-day i had a strange premonition that
it was bringing me to something new
and yet something old the explana-
tion of many mysteries of the past per-
haps to action in the future hark 

  winton had turned and was gazing
intently down the river his head thrust
forward his lips parted and his eyes
glowing beneath the contracted brows
it seemed an eternity that he stood
there inactive and tense and then there
came to his ears the faint but unmis-
takable rhythmic beat of a boats en-
gines

  its coming to me sternberg said
winton gravely as a graceful launch
cut the broad pathway of moonlight 
the river she heeled over as she
swung almost in a semicircle to clear
the fleet of anchored sampans in front
of the native city snd then coming to
an even keel she headed straight for
the bungalow landing stage

  its the same boat-the one which
towed the sampans exclaimed stern-
berg the boy must have been ex-
pecting her in spite of what he told
me for surely his father must be com-
ing

  the launch was now so close that
they could distinguish the figures of
those on board and especially clearly
a tall slender man who stood on the
tiny deck at the bow steadying himself
with a hand on an awning stanchion
wintons eyes were fixed on him and
although sternberg knew that stand-
ing as they did in the shadow of the
porch they must be invisible from the
launch he had an uncanny feeling that
the seal of confucius



their presence was divined by at least
one of its occupants for as the boat
passed the club landing the man in the
bow turned squarely toward them ap-
parently returning wintons fixed stare

  sternberg the age of miracles has
not passed the dead still come to life
for that is dick macpherson who died
at lang tun said winton with a
noticeable tremor in his voice as the
launch shot alongside the landing stage
and made fast i am going to him
would you care to accompany me

  wont morning do as well uncle
charley suggested the consul

  no he expects me to-night an-
swered winton confidently

  sternberg hesitated for a moment
and then drew his companion into the
semicircle of illumination from the hall-
way lamps

  see here uncle charley i half ex-
pected to find the light of madness in
your eyes but they are apparently all
right he said half seriously i
reckon that its just plain curiosity
which makes you want to go to-night
and which will make me go with you

  winton smiled as he pvilled away
from him and walked back to the rail-
in-

  very well its a thing which i pre-
fer not to argue about-it is better to
let time bring conviction he said as
sternberg rejoined him i believe
however that you will find that i am
right

  the consul shrugged his shoulders
but the scoffing answer which was on
the tip of his tongue was never fin-
ished for the comprador wong tom
seemed to have popped up through the
floor or to have dropped from the ceil-
ing so suddenly and mysteriously did
he appear before them

  mr winton sir my masta makee
compliments and say will he send boat
or you catch licksha to come bunga-
low side he asked and sternberg
looked from one to the other suspi-
ciously wondering if winton had not
been trying to mystify him he quickly
realized that his suspicion was unjust

  my compliments to mr macpher-
son and we should prefer a boat

winton answered my friend mr
sternberg the american consul will
come with me to pay his respects

  wong tom bowed respectfully and
disappeared as quietly as he had come

  sternberg watched him until he had
vanished in the shadows its high
time that you came back to take these
club boys in hand uncle charley he
said they have growrn careless with-
out your watchful eye on them they
should not allow a native to get in here
unannounced

  sternberg there is one thing that i
have learned in china-that it is a
waste of time and energy to attempt the
impossible he answered in a low
voice i might rage at them until i
was blue in the face and i should have
my trouble for my pains if i instructed
them to deny that man admittance

  what the deuce are you driving at
winton  demanded sternberg impa-
tiently it is a cast-iron rule of the
club and wong tom is only a com-
prador

  winton drew nearer and his voice
lowered still more perhaps he is
but i have warned you that you cant
believe all you see in china he said
gravely we have made one identifi-
cation to-night sternberg your rich-
ard macpherson is my dick macpher-
son now ill tell you of another your
model comprador wong tom is that
same fat bonze who fifteen years ago
had the power of life and death over
the foreigners in the hands of his coun-
trymen at lang tun

chapter iii

  there was nothing in macphersons
bearing or greeting which would have
suggested to a casual observer that
there was anything unusual in his meet-
ing with winton from whom he had
parted in such tragic surroundings nor
that he resented in the slightest degree
the uninvited presence of sternberg
he was a striking-looking man in his
immaculate yacht uniform of white-
tall and slender with the broad shoul-
ders straight back and slender waist
which suggested military training a

skin naturally swarthy had been tanned
by sun and wind to the hue of saddle
leather and contrasted strangely with
the closely cropped snow-white hair
and the carefully trimmed and pointed
mustache his eyes were of that pe-
culiar dark hue which makes it difficult
to distinguish the line between pupil
and iris the nose thin and aquiline
with the peculiar curve cut of nostril
suggesting a latent cruelty

  sternberg had known the bungalow
well in the days when the farleys
owned and occupied it but there was
nothing familiar in the room where they
found the new owner then it had
been typical of the temporary homes
of most foreigners in the east-a med-
ley of comfortable things imported
from home and a collection of porce-
lains weapons and other curios which
the foreigner invariably accumulates in
a strange land but during macpher-
sons brief ownership it had been abso-
lutely transformed and there was noth-
ing in its furnishing or decoration
which suggested that it was in china

  rich persian rugs covered the pol-
ished floor in place of the cooler and
more appropriate matting of the coun-
try  the furniture was obviously of eu-
ropean design and make and hunting
prints and engravings of sporting sub-
jects hung on the walls above the rows
of well-filled bookshelves it might
well have been the den or study of a
man accustomed to luxury in an eng-
lish country house and the servant who
had admitted them was as typical an
english butler as one could find in may-
fair

  winton in spite of his mind being
possessed with weightier things looked
about curiously for none knew better
than he what an expenditure such a
transformation implied and in the old
days macpherson had frankly admitted
that his means were of the slenderest

  but more impressive to him than the
change in the surroundings was the
change in the man himself on the
steamer and in hongkong-except dur-
ing those strange periods which always
followed his return from his expedi-
tions of mystery-macpherson had

been of a rollicking devil-may-care
temperament full of fun and always
ready for mischief and larks his hair
and mustache had been of raven black-
ness and his face had been free from
lines and care now it was marked
with two parallel perpendicular furrows
between the white eyebrows and the
mouth was set in straight stern lines
which gave one the impression that it
cottld never again relax into a smile

  itwas good of you to come winton
-and to bring mr sternberg with
you he said quietly and with just that
hint of hesitation before the inclusive
ending of his greeting to make the con-
sul suspicious that macpherson would
have been better pleased had winton
come alone i take it for granted that
your friend is not entirely unacquaint-
ed with ancient history

  i have told him pretty much all
that i knew of it which was little
enough answered winton i have
always believed that lang tun put a
period to it and that there was nothing
to be gained by digging back into the
past i always supposed that you
shared the fate of the others-that i
was the only caucasian who came alive
out of that compound where we parted
company in the darkness fifteen years
ago it is not more than two hours
since i learned that i was mistaken

  macpherson nodded and the fur-
rows between the eyebrows seemed to
deepen

  it was a tragedy of errors winton
he said ft was deluded with the same
belief i supposed that i was the only
survivor i have only a few months the
advantage of you in learning the truth
-or a part of it

  i have not been in hiding since
answered winton with just enough
emphasis on the personal pronoun to
give his comment a significance which
macpherson could not ignore

  the swarthy skin became of a darker
hue and for a moment there was a
strange light in the somber eyes but it
died quickly and his voice was even
and free from anger when he spoke

  see here winton lets assume for
the present that this whole thing has
the seal of confucius



been an honest and excusable error on
the part of each of us he said if
you adopt that tone it will be simple
for us to be at each others throats in
no time-which would prove nothing
at all i plead guilty to a possible ap-
pearance of hiding for unless you were
a student of burkes peerage you would
hardly have recognized dick macpher-
son under the string of aliases which
he inherited it took the keenest chi-
nese bloodhounds a dozen or more
years to accomplish it if you dont
mind well let it go at macpherson for
the present the titles would not inter-
est you

  i never heard of your reaching the
coast macpherson although i had con-
nections and acquaintances in every
port answered winton and stern-
berg was conscious from his tone that
his suspicions were by no means al-
layed

  but i never saw the coast of china
from the day i left hongkong to go to
lang tun until i sighted it from the
deck of my yacht a month ago an-
swered macpherson there is no use
of our talking at cross-purposes win-
ton  will you tell your story or shall i
lead off

  i should prefer to listen said win-
ton mine is of secondary importance
-it involves only myself go ahead
time is passing

  ill try not to waste it answered
macpherson there is no use in going
into all of the details but when i made
your acquaintance on the china i was
under orders for hongkong all of the
arrangements had been made by my
family i had a credit on the hong-
kong and shanghai bank for three hun-
dred pounds a year twenty-five pounds
to be paid to me personally on the first
day of each month no payments to be
anticipated under any circumstances
and the credit to lapse automatically if
i failed to appear in person for two
successive months

 a remittance man exclaimed
winton

  macpherson nodded exactly with
every precaution taken that i should
not break away that is one reason

ca

why there was no particular hue and
cry when i failed to appear after lang
tun the bankers are accustomed to
that sort of thing there had never
been any public scandal at home the
family council had just decided that i
was of no particular use and better
off out of europe i had started in the
guards-the blues-but i couldnt
stand the pace and transferred to a
hussar regiment ordered to india

  out there i didnt do any particu-
lar good i accumulated a rather heavy
score of debts and on top of that a
touch of the sun and fever im not
trying to make out a case for myself
but there is a lot of my life out there
which is hazy in my memory there
was no scandal that i know of but the
colonel invited me into the orderly room
one day and suggested that i affix my
signature to certain documents which
he had already made out they were my
papers and my connection with the
regiment ceased as soon as he could get
official approval by telegraph-which
enabled me to start for england that
same night

  there was no fatted calf sacrificed
to celebrate my return the younger son
of a younger son who has practically
been cashiered is not received with open
arms even when the head of the family
happens to be several times a baron a
few earls and a marquis mostly in the
irish and scotch peerage an arrange-
ment was made with my creditors-
they were mostly money lenders-and
the beauties of life in china were im-
pressed upon me i had no choice and
in any case i didnt much care so i
accepted the situation-and became
your fellow passenger on the china
from san francisco to my appointed
place of exile

  the rest of the story you pretty
well know winton i fell in love with
josephine and she consented to my plea
for an immediate marriage after we
landed in hongkong i cant tell you
how many times i have cursed the de-
cision to which we came to keep the
marriage secret until i had communi-
cated with my people remember i
was only twenty-three then and i trust-


the popular magazine

ed that they would accept the fact of
my marriage as a proof that i had
steadied and at the very least mate-
rially increase my remittances false
pride made me hesitate to announce our
marriage until i could give my wife
such an establishment as she deserved
and so we decided that she should go to
that accursed lang tun under her
maiden name and wait there until i
received answers to the very effusive
letters which i had sent home

 i received those answers-two
years later in london the family so-
licitor handed them to me reluctantly
i imagine that he had dictated them
and feared to lose a very lucrative
client in the meantime the tragedy
of lang tun had become a matter of
history winton i hope that you can
tell me what brought me there i only
know that i left hongkong on a shoot-
ing trip with a little half-caste who
called himself jenkinson there al-
though the chinese had another name
for him then i suddenly found my-
self in a room where a lot of strange
men were playing cards i remember
the rest of it of our racing through
the night to the mission station of my
finding josephine and then the fight-
ing

  go on said winton curtly you
found your wife in the hospital did
you not

  yes with a couple of missionary
medicos and three or four other
women answered macpherson none
of them had any conception of the real
danger which menaced them and the
men foolishly decided to close the
flimsy doors and parley with the riot-
ers as they called them from the win-
dows they would not listen to me
they knew that the people for whom
they had done so much would not harm
them i insisted that josephine should
come with me to remain was certain
death in immediate flight there was
perhaps one chance in a million

  we escaped from the rear of the
building as the mob was forming to
rush the front but the odds against
us were even greater than i had
counted

  i believe that i killed a man or
two but it was hopeless the cries of
the women who had been dragged from
the hospital were in our ears and i
turned my revolver against my wife
but that shot was never fired the
last that i remember was a cry of rage
and protest and then a million stars
danced before my eyes and all became
black it was weeks before i regained
consciousness and then i found myself
in a strange country among people
radically different from the chinese of
the southern provinces

  alone demanded winton sternly

  yes alone save for a few millions
of tartar chinese answered mac-
pherson ill make a long story short
winton although heaven knows it
seemed long enough in the making it
was necessary for me to learn a new
language before i could even beg for
information but that was the least of
my troubles for languages come easily
to me the blood of half the races of
europe is mixed in the macphersons
then i learned that i had been left
for dead where i had been struck down

  of course i have since learned that
that bloody orgy continued for many
days and nights and it seems physically
impossible that i should have survived
without some attention but a scotch
irishman takes a lot of killing and in
any case i survived then avhen the
last building had been plundered and
death had ended the suffering of the
last captive the mob began to count the
cost to remember that a day of reck-
oning would surely come and it melted
away the news had spread far and
people had come from the neighboring
provinces to join in the sport and plun-
dering as vultures flock to carrion
many of them had arrived too late
among them a troupe of strolling
mountebanks and bear tamers from the
north there was nothing left of set-
tlement or station but blackened walls
deserted even by the mob for the fear
of retribution lay heavy upon them and
they had slunk back to the slums of
lang tun

  the mountebanks retreating in dis-
gust at their hard luck stumbled across
the seal of confucius



me and while making an examination
in the hope that some trinket of value
might have been overlooked they found
that there was still a spark of life left
in me they added me to their cara-
van and carried me off giving me the
rough but effective treatment which
they had learned in a calling where bro-
ken heads were a part of the days
work

  on the whole i was not badly treat-
ed by my captors for i was valuable
to them but they lived hard themselves
and didnt give me any the best of it
i was kept almost continuously in a
stout cage such as they used for the
animals that was not to prevent my
escape for they had impressed upon
me the hopelessness of such an attempt
but as a measure of protection from
the malice of the crowds who flocked
to see me but the life had become so
intolerable that i determined to take
any chance which offered the oppor-
tunity came after an exhibition in a vil-
lage at the very tip of the empire right
on the borders of tibet

  gentleman there is no use in re-
counting the adventures and hardships
of my flight across tibet i won
through at last to the indian frontier
and then so small is this world of
ours i fell into the hands of a detach-
ment from the very troop which i had
served with in the hussars for the
regiment was guarding the frontier
against a threatened outbreak and in-
cursion of the border tribes naturally
i was unrecognizable and i had no
wish to disclose my identity for it
wasnt pleasant to think of returning
in such guise to the company of men
wrho two years before had virtually
kicked me out of the mess i believed
that i could bluff it through but i had
not reckoned that i might be regarded
with suspicion owing to the disturbed
state of the country

  the regiment had suffered severely
from sniping it had lost many horses
and several men each night for more
than a week and suspicious characters
brought in by the patrols were given
short shrift unless they could account
for themselves no one had the slight-

est suspicion that i was anything but a
native and silence on my part would
have led to summary execution

  gentlemen that declaration was not
the least trying of all the hardships con-
nected with my escape of course i
knew that i was in no further danger
of punishment but i expected to meet
averted faces and to be escorted out of
camp you can imagine my surprise
when i was welcomed with open arms
and treated as if i had conferred honor
on the regiment when i had served with
it

  those two years had made a vast
difference death had been busy in my
family at home when i sent in my
papers i was richard macpherson an
unimportant member of one of the old-
est families in great britain a series
of accidents had changed all of that
the six lives which stood between me
and any benefit i might receive from
my birth had been snuffed out in quick
succession and i had come into a string
of imposing titles and one of the larg-
est fortunes in the peerage that is
why you never heard of dick macpher-
son again winton he was lost in the
greatness which he had inherited-too
late to bring him happiness

  it did bring him power however
-a power which he used to the utmost
to prevent the history of those last two
years becoming public property there
was nothing to be gained naturally
every possible scrap of information
which the government had in regard
to the lang tun affair was placed at
my disposition but after all that was
mostly secondhand as i appreciate
now

  the principal document was the of-
ficial report of one of your predeces-
sors as consul mr sternberg it stat-
ed that all of the people at the mission
had been accounted for their bodies
identified and given christian burial
my wifes name was on that list-her
maiden name of course for there had
never been public announcement of our
marriage remember i saw only the
opening of that horrible affair but
from what i have since learned i know
that report must have been fiction it


the popular magazine

would have been impossible to make
such identifications

  it was the published report which
you saw mr macpherson said stern-
berg there is no use in denying the
fact that it did not contain all of the
truth that is contained in the confiden-
tial report to the secretary of state of
which i have a copy at the consulate
you can appreciate the reason for not
giving it out

  man man what a lot of misery
might have been prevented had the
truth been told fifteen years ago ex-
claimed macpherson bitterly i be-
lieved that lying report and from the
day i accepted it as verity i tried to
forget that china existed had i sus-
pected that it was a lie i should have
dragged the emperor from the walls of
the forbidden city itself to get at the
truth to have found my wife if she
lived or certain proof of her death
of my own sufferings i do not speak
though god knows what they have
been but for fifteen years a helpless
woman-your countrywoman and my
wife-has been the prisoner of those
devils who sacked lang tun

  for a moment following the declara-
tion there was absolute silence and
then white of face and trembling win-
ton rose from his chair

  macpherson are you mad or can
this thing be true he exclaimed bro-
kenly josephine lived through that
horrible time perhaps i was prepared
to believe that for to-night i saw your
son but fifteen years- it is im-
possible 

  i am just beginning to learn that
nothing is impossible answered mac-
pherson grimly as he touched a bell
on the table beside him

  the english servant who had ad-
mitted them answered the summons
macpherson made a sign with his hand
which the servant mutely acknowledged
with a respectful bow and left the
room a moment later the door again
opened and the boy whom they had
seen on the dock entered

  there was no mistaking the likeness
between father and son the boy was
the living image of the man in feature

and coloring his expression too was
impassive but curiously unlike that of
his father macphersons face was a
mask which one instinctively felt hid
suffering the boys expression was the
mask of the orient a veil which no
western eyes have ever learned to pen-
etrate he stood before them in re-
spectful silence but there was just a
hint of defiance half sullen half mock-
ing in his eyes as he looked from one
to the other

  there is living evidence of the truth
of my assertion that nothing is impos-
sible said macpherson bitterly gen-
tlemen this is my son through me he
is kin to half the noble families of eu-
rope  his mother was a sweet clean-
blooded american girl of old new eng-
land puritan stock centuries of hered-
itary influence have operated to make
him an anglo-saxon and have suc-
ceeded only in stamping the macpher-
son likeness on his face for thirteen
ears of training in the orient have
made him heart and soul a china-
man

chapter iv

  the boy listened impassively to the
tirade which was practically a denun-
ciation that impassivity possibly the
most convincing proof which could
have been afforded of the justice of his
fathers estimate of him he was a
picture of curious contrasts as he stood
there his clear-cut profile straight eyes
and gracefully poised head as striking-
ly out of harmony with the baggy un-
couth native costume as was the bit of
transplanted england which he had en-
tered in discord with the great east
which environed it winton was still
shaken and tremendously agitated from
the effect of macphersons astonishing
announcement and had apparently for-
gotten the existence of the boy but
sternberg lacking the intense personal
interest in the whole tragic history
which possessed the others found the
boy the most interesting of the strange
human documents which comprised it

  when the boy had been haled be-
fore him at the consulate he had been
puzzled by that stolid impassivity which
thb sb ml of confucius



so irritated macpherson and even more
puzzled by the attitude of the ruffianly
chinese soldiers who had made him a
prisoner they had treated him with
that subtle deference which they might
have accorded to a mandarin while it
was perfectly evident that they only
refrained from manhandling young
astly because of the most unpleasant
punishment meted out to the soldiery
by their superiors for any open disre-
spect shown to the hated foreign devils

  perhaps the boy instinctively felt that
of the three adults the consul was at
least the least antagonistic for it was
to him he turned breaking the silence
which had grown embarrassing with a
courteous expression of regret for hav-
ing been a possible bother to him as
a result of his fight in the native city

  sternberg was about to answer mak-
ing light of the whole matter when he
was forestalled by an eager demand for
details from macpherson

  the consul supplied them hesitantly
and when the recital was finished mac-
pherson looked at the boy approvingly

  by jove perhaps there is some an-
glo-saxon in you after all he ex-
claimed you say that he thrashed
them both well sternberg there was
no kicking and scratching about it-
just fair straight punching

  greatly relieved sternberg amplified
and perhaps embroidered his story with
most satisfactory details he was a
sympathetic person and underneath the
bitter hardness of macpliersons exte-
rior he read the heart hunger of a dis-
appointed and lonely man the eager
longing to find something which he
could love of which he could be proud
in this boy who was stamped with his
likeness and bore his name and watch-
ing them closely he thought that he
could detect just a momentary flash of
responsiveness beneath the mask of the
boys stolidity a faint echo of that
silent cry

  i cant tell you a great deal more
macpherson resumed his story not
because i have anything to conceal but
there is little that i know myself he
turned to winton winton you at
any rate can understand why i finally

accepted what i believed to be the in-
evitable in a way which must seem sur-
prisingly casual to sternberg there was
nothing to be gained by stirring up the
past and my only hope for even a
measure of peace lay in forgetting it
you can also surmise about how suc-
cessful i was in that although i drove
myself to find occupation for every
waking moment

  yes i know-there are always the
dreams assented winton gravely
sympathy for a moment banishing dis-
trust and suspicion from his eyes i
found them even worse when i tried to
live in america than after i came back
here

  i can believe that-from my own
experience continued macpherson
for a horrible ten years i seemed to
be enveloped in a horrible mist as soon
as my head touched the pillow awake
i resolutely banished the thought of
everything chinese from my mind
scrupulously avoiding anything which
might bring up painful memories or
suggest this accursed country but the
visions came in the night the faces of
those men who were with you in the
cardroorr of the lang tun club of
the men and women who were with my
wife in the mission hospital and of the
yellow devils who swarmed about us

i was always powerless fighting away
that horrible mist which smothered and
strangled me that continued until two
years ago and then suddenly the mist
became a net equally as baffling but
at least giving me the sensation of
something solid to struggle against
the change followed the appearance of
a chinaman the first one i had seen
since i interviewed those plausible liars
at the chinese legation after my return
to london

  you knew him-it was one of your
old acquaintances out here demanded
winton eagerly macpherson shrugged
his shoulders

  perhaps i may have seen him a
thousand times but i didnt recognize
him he replied i was on one of
my estates in scotland for the deer-
stalking and the gillies found him con-
cealed in a clump of firs from which


the vovulatr magazine

he was watching the house they had
handled him pretty severely before they
brought him to me and i wasted no
time with him i shall not weary you
with the details of it but that was only
the beginning and for the next three
months do what i might to avoid them
i was conscious that i was rarely free
from the scrutiny of oblique eyes the
espionage was never obtrusive and i
never succeeded in getting one of the
slippery devils in my grip it became
a perfect obsession we are conserva-
tive at home you know so being in
difficulties i did as all well-regulated
british peers do when they need some
one to think for them-i consulted my
solicitor

  he was the one man in england
who knew the story of my experiences
in the east he and his forefathers had
kept the macpherson consciences for
generations and i expect that a lot of
family skeletons of which even i am
ignorant are locked in the old strong
boxes of the firm i doivt believe that
anything could surprise him and he
listened to my tale of the latest devel-
opments as stolidly as he usually took
my directions as to the renewal of a
lease they are a queer lot-those so-
licitors who dry nurse the british aris-
tocracy-and my man guilfoyle is the
queerest of them all he never talks
more than he can help and he had noth-
ing to offer when i had finished except
the assurance that he would give the
matter his immediate and personal at-
tention he certainly did and with the
most surprising results for two days
later he appeared with this young gen-
tleman whom he introduced to me as
my son and the heir to the macpher-
son titles and estates as formally and
casually as he would have presented
some trivial legal document for my
signature

  ill not waste time in analyzing my
emotions for you gentlemen guil-
foyle was not the man to accept any-
thing on faith and even without his
assurance i should have believed that
this strange chinese changeling was my
offspring for he was cast absolutely
in the macpherson mold guilfoyle

made no mystery about it he had gone
straight to the chinese legation after
hearing my story after the manner
of diplomats white or yellow they had
asked more questions than they an-
swered until they had assured them-
selves that the nobleman whom he rep-
resented was in fact that same richard
macpherson who was in china fif-
teen years ago then explaining that
ever since lang tun the chinese gov-
ernment had vainly tried to find trace
of me they produced this young man
and trusted that his lordship would now
see his way clear to being equally mag-
nanimous

   and that concluded guilfoyle i
took it upon myself to promise and i
should most earnestly advise your lord-
ship to overhaul your memory con-
cerning things which happened during
your stay in china and which you have
not confided to me the boy is only
an evidence of good faith my lord-
a retainer as we might say in my pro-
fession-and i am convinced that other
rewards will follow compliance with
their wishes

  step by step and day by day we
went over together everything which i
could remember from the day i landed
in hongkong until i reached the fron-
tier of india human memory is fal-
lible but so far as i could recall we
went over every detail and there is but
one blank-the few days immediately
preceding the lang tun massacre i
remember leaving hongkong with jen-
kinson and traveling by steamer to can-
ton from there we traveled inland
for a day or two and then there conies
a blank until i found myself that aw-
ful night in the club at lang tun

  guilfoyle was convinced of my sin-
cerity and he carried that conviction
back with him to the chinese legation
instructed by me to accede to anything
they might demand which it was in my
power to do but they evidently did not
share his belief in my veracity they
would formulate no demand insinuat-
ing that i knew exactly what was want-
ed neither would they furnish a sin-
gle scrap of information which would
throw light on the fate of my wife
the seal of confucius



my boy was equally unable to enlighten
us he had no recollection of his mother
--from infancy he had known no one
but chinese he had been carefully
reared and given an education of sorts
among other things he had a good
foundation in english

  and there for nearly two years the
matter has rested for we have wasted
that time in absolutely futile endeavors
to come to an understanding with the
legation people they could not be
shaken in their absolutely firm convic-
tion that i knew what they wanted and
was lying and bluffing

  i placed the boy in one of the great
public schools of england he wtas
there for a year and i think the head
master was relieved when i recalled
him to come out here with me he told
me frankly that he could not get hold
of him as he did of english boys he
could make no specific complaint but
the boy simply baffled him guilfoyle
and i had found the same difficulty
there was nothing which seemed to ap-
peal particularly to his affection his
ambition or his pride he accepted
everything as a matter of course and
the first real interest which he ever dis-
played was when i announced that i
had decided to come to china-a de-
cision which i reached when the lega-
tion announced to guilfoyle that fur-
ther parleying was useless and sug-
gested that perhaps a personal visit to
the east might refresh a memory which
was evidently at fault

  mind yon gentlemen the chinese
legation people never made the slight-
est admission which we could definitely
take hold of but in analyzing the whole
thing guilfoyle and i reached exactly
the same conclusion the boy had been
produced as an evidence that my wife
had lived through the massacre of lang
tun for he was born about five months
afterward they dared not make the
admission that she still lives for that
would have meant the usual naval dem-
onstration humiliating apologies and a
tremendous indemnity in land or treas-
ure but the fact that they had volun-
tarily produced the boy was sufficient
indication that they believed they still

held a more valuable hostage we have
argued and negotiated at cross-purposes
because of their distrust they refuse to
believe that i am sincere in disclaiming
all knowledge of what they want

  winton i am less suspicious than
you are i know that of all the men
who came out with us on the china
fifteen years ago you were the only one
whom my wife trusted and cared for
i know that it was her business which
called you to lang tun i know that
after fifteen years of silence her first
communication bids me to rely upon
you and be guided by your advice-
and i am here to ask it he stopped
abruptly and sternberg leaned forward
eagerly his eyes fixed on wintons
face winton remained perfectly calm
and with aggravating deliberation se-
lected a cheroot from his case and
lighted it

  what has become of guilfoyle  he
asked and while there was nothing
offensive in the question itself his voice
and expression invested it with a mean-
ing that verged on insult a momen-
tary flash in macphersons eyes was
the onlyr suggestion of resentment on
his part but while the boys face re-
mained absolutely passive sternberg
noticed that the hand which was half
concealed in the loose sleeve became a
clenched fist macpherson hesitated for
a moment and then his voice abso-
lutely without emotion gave a matter-
of-fact answer to the matter-of-fact
question

  he left the yacht at suez he said
quietly i cant tell you why but lie
took a p  o ship for bombay there
i am expecting his arrival any day he
would not tell me wlrat he was after
see here winton i know that you dis-
trust me but i give you my word that
i have told you the absolute truth
what is it that you suspect what
do you wish to know that i can tell
you 

  for a full minute they looked each
other squarely in the eyes and in the
end it was wintons which were avert-
ed seeking the tip of his cigar

  there is a great deal which you
would have to tell me macpherson


the popular magazine

he said quietly i am like your chi-
nese friends of the legation it is diffi-
cult for me to believe in such a com
plete lapse of memory but we will let
the few days before lang tun go
at that there was a time before lang
tun-those weeks which you spent in
hongkong after your wife had depart-
ed for the mission-which leaves a
great deal to be explained if we are to
see eye to eye

  a puzzled expression came to mac-
phersons face

  yes those weeks-what of them
he asked heaven knowts they were
sufficiently tedious to me i wtas on ten
terhooks awaiting the answers to the
communications which i had sent home

i have told you the reason for my re-
maining there

  yes but you have told us nothing
of your mysterious absences-those ex-
cursions which you made so quietly
away from the knowledge of every one
in the foreign quarter answered win-
ton  and macpherson looked at him in
blank amazement

  what in the deuce are you driving 
at  he demanded impatiently i
bored myself to death at that infernal
club perhaps i drank more than was
good for me at times but that was

nothing to be-

  nonsense interrupted winton
curtly i am not talking of that sort
of thing but of the periods in which
you spent days at a time away from
hongkong evidently in queer company
from the acquaintances that you made

i remember that the disreputable little
half-caste jenkinson was one of them

i knew him we all did he was the
go-between in recovering our property
whenever the chinese pulled off a suc-
cessful robbery the police were after
him when he disappeared they had
concluded that he was more than a
fence-that he planned every big job
which they pulled off he was only
a sample and hardly a fair one for
your acquaintances included worse
characters than he-the pirates of the
river the desperadoes of the slums of
the native quarter all of that has got
to be explained macpherson

  macpherson sat as one dumfounded
and then slowly the mask of impassiv-
ity dropped from his face perplexity
deepened to bewilderment in his eyes
and he rose unsteadily from his chair
a tremulous hand passed and repassed
over his forehead as if it were vainly
trying to brush some impalpable but
troublesome thing away

  winton tell me what you mean of
what you accuse me he said huskily
you are speaking in riddles for i
know nothing of this i have not the
slightest recollection of any such thing
happening in hongkong back in in-
dia-yes it did happen but i believed
it was the sun my colonel thought so
too he acknowledged that he had been
unjust-that i had not been responsi-
ble

  macpherson i dont care a copper
cash for what happened back in india
exclaimed winton harshly i am
speaking of hongkong and fifteen years
ago and i can tell you of one item
which was discovered later about your
chosen companion jenkinson it was
conclusively proven that it was he who
plotted the looting of the avondale the
only entirely successful attack which
has been made by the pirates on the
canton steamer you may remember
it it was while you were waiting in
hongkong all of the european offi-
cers and passengers were butchered
the booty was tremendous but the pi-
rates are supposed to have missed what
they were really after-a mysterious
treasure which was being transported

  i was there interrupted macpher-
son and both winton and sternberg
jumped to their feet startled by an
unearthly quality in the mans voice
more than by his astonishing statement
his dark skin had suddenly turned sal-
low and his staring eyes with dilated
pupils looked past them unseeingly
that is right they did miss the treas-
ure although they tortured the cap-
tain and officers most fiendishly in their
effort to uncover it he went on it
was of no use some fool had fired the
boat and it burned like tinder driving
the captors off with a few paltry thou-
the seal of confucius



sands in gold for their reward it was
a pitiful failure after so much risk

  macpherson had spoken like an au-
tomaton a man detached from himself
sternberg was intensely interested but
he had an uneasy half-guilty feeling
as if he were eavesdropping winton
however had no scruples his face
hardened as he listened and when mac-
phersons recital ended he was quick
to prompt him to other disclosures

  yes it was a pitiful failure and one
which led to another attempt a short
time later he said you may remem-
ber that macpherson although it did
not create such a sensation in hong-
kong because no foreigners were among
the victims it was the attack on the
shen fun caravan which was rescued
only by the opportune arrival of the
viceroys military escort the prison-
ers taken admitted before they were
executed that they were the same pi-
rates who had looted the avondale
there were queer rumors afloat about
the entire affair you may have heard
them

 rumors why should i listen to
rumors answered macpherson in
that same peculiar voice they were

the same- with the lithe grace of

a panther the boy sprang forward
placing one hand on macphersons
shoulder the other lightly over his lips
the interruption was effectual in more
ways than one it cut short any avowal
which his father might have made and
at the same time served to arouse him
from that strange condition of trance
into which he had drifted he drew
away from the boy and looked about
him curiously but it was the boy who
spoke

  gentlemen my father is not well
he said quietly you can see that he
is not himself and it is unfair to--

  what in the deuce are you talking
about dick broke in macpherson im-
patiently his voice once more natural
but still a trace of perplexity in his
eyes winton you were making some
absurd charges against me of my be-
havior in hongkong lets have done
with it do you mind telling me plainly
what it is that you suspect me of

  winton motioned the boy aside with
an imperative gesture i have made
no accusation he said sternly i have
demanded certain explanations which
i believe i had a right to do i have
distrusted everything but the evidence
of my own senses since the first discov-
ery that i made to-night-that your
most trusted servant your comprador
wong tom is the same man who fif-
teen years ago was virtually in com-
mand of the looters at lang tun
macpherson entiiely himself again
betrayed not the slightest surprise or
emotion

  then if what i have heard is true
you have small cause to quarrel with
him he answered quietly i under-
stand that it was through his efforts
that your life was spared

  you knew of this when you em-
ployed him exclaimed winton

 macpherson nodded assent i
should have employed him if he had
worn horns a spiked tail and a cloven
hoof he has the best of recommenda-
tions winton you will hardly ques-
tion them he met me when the yacht
dropped anchor at hongkong it was
he who brought the letter from jose-
phine in it she tells me to trust im-
plicitly in two men-yourself and the
bearer of the letter whom you know as
my comprador wong tom

  you have that letter  demanded
winton

  i have

  i should like to see it

  macpherson took a step backward as
winton extended his hand and looked
at him defiantly

  you may not winton-you nor no
other man so long as i live he replied
for a moment winton looked into the
dark eyes which met his unfalteringly
and then with a shrug of his shoulders
he turned to the consul

  i think that we had better be get-
ting back to the club sternberg he
said the fellows should have re-
turned from the hills by this time
macpherson stepped forward before
sternberg could answer whats the
meaning of this winton he asked


the cpocpulacr magazine

sharply i do not intend to have my
story retailed for club gossip

  sternberg attempted to intervene
with the assurance that he would re-
gard everything he had heard as con-
fidential but winton brushed him
aside

  i cant tell you the meaning of it
macpherson he said i am no pur-
veyor of club gossip but i am not a
reckless fool chee nung is nearly
twro hundred miles from the coast the
settlement and the missions are impor-
tant but after all the whites are but
a handful wrhen compared to the
swarming population of the native city
and the sampan fleet

  well what of that there is no
threat of a rising protested macpher-
son  and again wrinton shrugged his
shoulders

  tn my knowledge of china the ris-
ings have rarely been preceded by
threats he answered i suppose that
there have always been signs and pre-
monitions if they could have been read
i make no pretense at prophecy but
the man is a fool who does not profit
by experience fifteen years ago your
appearance at hongkong was followed
by the looting of the avondale and you
have acknowledged that you were there
-and you are the sole european sur-
vivor of that slaughter then followed
the attack on the shen fun caravan
which happened during one of your
mysterious absences from hongkong
there were strange rumors of a mys-
terious white renegade connected with
the story of that attack a few weeks
later your appearance at lang tun is
followed by the most appalling mas-
sacre of foreigners in the whole history
of china

  for fifteen years you disappear ab-
solutely and when you reappear you
are hand in glove with wong tom
whose activities in the past justify our
suspicions for the future perhaps you
have told me the absolute truth mac-
pherson but it is so strange and gro-
tesque a story that it demands a meas-
ure of corroboration that will re-
quire time and if a few quiet words
of advice from me will prevent it there

will be no repetition of the opening of
the lang tun tragedy

  sternberg had quietly ranged himself
beside winton alert for trouble win-
ton had spoken quietly but his words
were a terrible arraignment and mac-
pherson had listened with hardening
face little of sympathy as had pre-
viously existed between father and son
wintons implied accusations had evi-
dently aroused blood loyalty and al-
most imperceptibly dick had moved to
his fathers side sternberg knew that
no mere verbal denial could adequately
meet that accusation winton had
spoken without passion carefully
choosing his words and driving home
the points of his arraignment as might
a public prosecutor before a court

  but macpherson was no helpless
prisoner compelled by superior force to
listen in silence his dark face had be-
come livid and the blood lust shone
from his eyes as he faced them the
whole atmosphere had suddenly be-
come quick with passion with vio-
lence with murder and then just as
suddenly it cleared

  the heavy curtains covering the long
window parted and as noiselessly and
as mysteriously as he had appeared at
the club wong tom stood in the room
there was not the slightest change jn
his apparel but the change in the man
himself was remarkable he was no
longer the placid deferential compra-
dor but a man accustomed to com-
mand and to having his commands un-
hesitatingly obeyed and from the mo-
ment of his entrance his personality
dominated the situation fie raised his
hand in an imperative gesture and
macpherson fell back wmton whose
muscles had become tense against an
expected attack felt them relax and
the consuls hand which had instinc-
tively started for the revolver in his
hip pocket just as instinctively fell
empty to his side

  i have heard everything gentle-
men he said quietly his english free
from even a suggestion of accent mr
winton i offer you a part of the cor-
roboration which you require mr
macpherson has told you the truth so
the seal of confucius



far as he knows it your suspicions
ire justifiable but some of your deduc-
tions are wrong

  winton stepped forward evidently to
make indignant protest the interrup-
tion caused by wong toms entrance
had been a relief but once the surprise
of it had passed the ingrained sense of
superiority which the humblest cau-
casian feels for even the greatest man
of black or yellow skin asserted itself
and with it came resentment at his as-
sumption of command the chinaman
apparently read what was passing in
his mind for he stepped forward arid
checked him with a gesture

  i have told you that some of your
deductions are wrong others are cor-
rect but they do not go far enough
he said as he stretched out his hand
palm upward from a voluminous
sleeve mr winton the life of every
foreigner in the settlement and missions
of chee nung lies in the hollow of my
hand if i close my lingers your aveng-
ing countrymen will find what they
found at lang tun-blackened ruins
and unrecognizable corpses for fif-
teen years i have waited for this night
-and i shall not-be denied

chapter v

  as a man hypnotized sternberg
gazed at that extended hand for wtong
toms words had carried conviction
to winton wiser in the subtleties of
the people with whom he had lived so
long it was merely a symbol and dis-
regarding it he looked searchingly at
the eyes which so defiantly met his
in them he read little of comfort for
as well as any foreigner can he under-
stood the chinese and he knew that
wong tom had made  idle boast

  dick from the moment of wong
toms entrance had practically effaced
himself withdrawing from the side of
his father to an inconspicuous corner of
the room and sternberg taking his
cue from wintons attitude stood ab-
solutely passive watching curiously
for the moment both he and winton
had forgotten macpherson and as for
wong tom he had practically ignored

him from the start and of the three
wong tom was the only one who re-
mained calm and unstartled when mac-
pherson having edged toward the door
threw it open and sounded a shrill blast
on a silver yacht whistle

  winton already suspicious was
quick to read treachery in the signal
and with a cry of warning to stern-
berg he whipped out his pistol and
backed against the wall the consul
followed suit but wong tom stood
stock-still a smile of mingled amuse-
ment and mockery on his face as he
looked at macpherson

  suspicion must be contagious mr
winton he said quietly mr mac-
phersons confidence in me was un-
shaken until you met i should advise
you to put your pistol away his re-
tainers are apt to be impetuous both
of the americans took the advice for
from without came a few words of
warning and a sharp command both in
english tinctured with a broad scotch
accent the crunching of the gravel
beneath heavy-soled boots denied the
advance of the silent-footed chinese
and in a moment they caught sight
through the open doorway of a dozen
brawny sailors in white duck uniforms
each heavily armed and all under the
command of a gigantic man with flam-
ing red hair on whose sleeve was the
insignia of a quartermasters rating

 i would suggest that they would be
equally available if they remained in
the hallway and it may save you em-
barrassment if you close the door mr
macpherson said the chinaman quiet-
ly for a moment macpherson hesi-
tated his hand on the knob and then
with a curt stand by  which the quar-
termaster acknowledged with a tug at
his flaming forelock he shut the door
and stood with his back against it

  go on wong tom he said de-
fiantly the presence of these men
is not a threat it is a precaution the
chinaman accepted the assurance with
a smile

  it was one which i anticipated you
would take from the moment i boarded
your yacht in hongkong he said
blandly fifty or sixty men would


the vovulacr magazine

have been a generous crew for a craft
of that size but i noted more than a
hundred idling about her decks surely
a half dozen of them would have suf-
ficed to bring the launch up from the
coast so i suspected that the extra
dozen crowded into the after cockpit
and concealed by the drawn curtains
were not on board to aid in the navi-
gation

  an angry flush came to macphersons
dark face everything you say justi-
fies the precautions i have taken he
asserted i have not forgotten the
two years i spent in a cage nor the
treachery which led to that ignominious
captivity come what may there will
be  repetition of that wong tom
the men outside are a fair sample of
the yachts crew and i can assure you
that they are not peaceful missionaries
nor helpless traders who will accept
butchery lying down

  the chinaman shrugged his shoul-
ders i believe that for i recognized
a number of them as the gamekeepers
and gillies of your scotch estates i
had occasion to dodge more than one
of them on their native heath he said
and both winton and sternberg ap-
preciated that the tacit confession of
espionage was not made artlessly

  macphersons face became as black
as a thundercloud and he advanced
threateningly toward the chinaman

   you were one of those infernal spies
who made my life miserable he ex-
claimed  and unawed and unabashed
wong tom nodded assent

  yes i directed the wthole investi-
gation he admitted i would sug-
gest that you take things more calmly
mr macpherson in your own country
you were helpless with practically an
army of retainers at your command
it is not probable that a mere hand-
ful of men would be of much service
in the heart of the chinese empire

  he is right macpherson exclaimed

	winton quickly fearful that a rash
word or act might precipitate the trou-
ble which he felt hovered about them
be careful man wong tom has ar-
ranged your entire establishment and
he has not thrown his cards on the

table without knowing that he held the
winning hand

  the chinaman nodded approvingly
your insight justifies my decision to
have you invited into this affair mr
winton he said the wisdom of
that step was doubted in certain quar-
ters but i am glad that my counsel
prevailed i have not planned and
waited for fifteen years to have every-
thing upset by a moment of passion
it was not difficult to bring mr mac-
pherson to china and now that he is
here i trust that it will not prove too
difficftlt to persuade him to be reason-
able

  wait said macpherson sullenly
and walking to the door he opened it
and gave a curt order to the quarter-
master again a tug at that flaming
forelock acknowledged it and even as
macpherson closed the door they heard
the heavy tread of the sailors as they
withdrew toward the launch now i
trust that you are satisfied and that
you will be good enough to tell me about
what i am to expect he continued i
have wanted to be entirely reasonable
all along so far as i am concerned it
is a perfectly plain proposition i have
every reason to believe that my wife
survived the lang tun massacre and
lives a prisoner in some part of this
beastly country i am prepared to make
any sacrifice to ransom her but i have
never been able to get a definite de-
mand i have been met with the ab-
solutely baseless assumption that i
knew what was wanted of me and now
winton caps that by making the most
absurd charges against me

  wong tom apparently gratified and
relieved that a situation which had
threatened disaster had ended quietly
smiled sympathetically and his oblique
eyes fairly radiated benevolence

  mr macpherson i believe that you
are perfectly sincere and that you are
stating what you believe to be absolute
verity or you would find yourself in
a very different position he said
paradoxical as it may seem mr win-
ton has every foundation of fact for his
charges do not interrupt me please
he exclaimed peremptorily as mac-
the seal of confucius



phersons expression betrayed the im-
minence of angry protest you have
demanded an explanation and i shall
give as much as is permitted i speak
of things within my own personal
knowledge of events which my eyes
witnessed mr macpherson fifteen
years ago you were present at the loot-
ing of the avondale of such part as
you may have played in the capture of
the steamer i do not speak for of that
i know nothing from my own observa-
tion you were i believe a passenger
bound for canton ostensibly on a sight-
seeing expedition but i do know that
after the steamer was in the possession
of the pirates you acted as the leader
of those who ransacked the holds and
cabins while jenkinson supervised the
torturing of the european officers on
the deck you were the last man to
retreat from the flames

  macphersons face had become livid
as he listened you lie he gasped

  wong tom ignored the insulting de-
nial furthermore he continued
evenly the rumors of the presence of
a caucasian at the attack on the shen
fun caravan some ten days later had
this much foundation of fact you
were there leading the desperate
charges of the brigands you escaped
capture only because that same jenkin-
son had a half dozen of them seize you
and hurry you away when the viceroys
guard came to the rescue and made the
carefully planned attack hopeless
those brigands were the same river pi-
rates who captured the avondale
macphersons eyes dropped for a mo-
ment and when he again raised them
they were filled wtith piteous appeal as
he looked at the two americans per-
haps he had expected to find an ex-
pression of triumph on wintons face
but even suspicion had departed from
it and he read only sympathy

  gentlemen you cannot really be-
lieve that these atrocious charges are
true he exclaimed piteously win-
ton you know how this yellow devil
has wrongedme and he has been quick
to take a hint from what you said
you whisper of a white renegade and
he shouts my name

  winton stepped forward and placed
his hand gently on his shoulder

  steady old man no one is dis-
posed to judge harshly lets hear him
out there is more to this is there not
wong tom

  the chinaman gravely bowed assent
yes or we should not be here to-
gether he answered mr winton
you at least know of shen fun

  yes i saw its towers and battle-
ments in the distance when i journeyed
to lang tun replied winton natu-
rally i was curious about it for i knew
that no foreigner was permitted within
its gates it is the sacred city as i
understand it-the only one in the em-
pire which is ruled absolutely by
priests

  in a general way your information
is correct said the chinaman like
peking there is a city within a city
inside of the outer walls the imperial
mandarins exercise a measure of au-
thority for the population is much like
that of other great chinese towns but
inside of the sacred precincts which
corresponds to the forbidden city of
peking the priests rule supreme it
is a sanctuary the treasure house for
all that the believers in the teachings of
confucius hold most sacred the sanc-
tuary was never violated until fifteen
years ago gentlemen mr macpher-
son is the only caucasian who ever
passed out alive from the sacred pre-
cincts of shen fun

  macpherson for a moment seemed
stunned sternberg looked at him with
a new interest for he was new enough
to china to chafe under restrictions
which older residents learn to accept as
a matter of course that macpherson
had penetrated and returned alive from
the mysterious city seemed more re-
markable to him than any of the strange
things he had heard that night for am-
bassadors and even visiting royalties
had been rigidly excluded from its
walls winton however accepted the
statement without the least evidence of
surprise

  i have been suspicious of that he
said quietly shen fun is less than
fifty miles from lang tun and i saw


the popular magazine

macpherson when he arrived there
you can tell us more wong tom
macpherson had recovered himself
and he broke in angrily before the
chinaman could answer you credit
this infernal tissue of lies winton
he demanded you who know that

my one thought was for-

  stop macpherson interrupted the
chinaman sternly courtesy and pa-
tience have limits which you may not
transgress with impunity i am stating
the exact truth but i do not hold you
responsible in the ordinary sense if i
did your life would be forfeit and all
of your blood would make vicarious
atonement for fifteen years your son
has been in our power and my pro-
tection has saved him

  do not misunderstand me i know
that you are a brave man and i am not
seeking to terrify you by threats but
you are not your own master you have
come to china for a purpose to ac-
complish that purpose you must live
to live you require my protection to
receive it you must be guided by me
macpherson shook his head hope-
lessly shall i never be able to make
you understand that my one wish has
been to do anything and everything
to give anything and everything that
you may demand and which it is in
my power to do or give he exclaimed
irritably there is the matter in a
nutshell and all of this melodramatic
stuff which you have devised has been
worse than useless

  no you are entirely mistaken in
that mr macpherson answered
wong tom earnestly the proposi-
tion which i have to make would have
sounded melodramatic and absurd in
scotland you could not have granted
our demands then you cannot now un-
less you will place yourself absolutely
in my hands it is impossible because
the knowledge which you possess and
which you must transmit to us lies only
in your subconscious mind lies dor-
mant with the sleeping memory of those
other things-the looting of the avon-
dale the attack on the shen fun cara-
van your visit to shen fun itself and
what happened there-events in your

life of which i believe you to be ab-
solutely ignorant

  macphersons face was a study as he
listened and when the chinaman
stopped speaking he turned to winton
a smile of derision on his lips

  winton you are reputed to be wtiser
in the ways of the east than any other
foreigner can you explain to me what
sort of a hocus-pocus he is trying to
put up against me he asked

  without answering winton looked
inquiringly at wong tom

  the chinaman nodded i expect that
you understand enough of it to make
it clear mr winton he said you
saw mr macpherson in hongkong
after the loot of the avondale and the
caravan attack and you were at lang
tun when he sought refuge there after
his flight from shen fun you can
testify that he was certainly not him-
self-that his mental condition was not
normal

  that is entirely correct macpher-
son agreed winton i can vouch
for that you were as a man bewitched
or in a trance fey was what bill

lennie called your condition-

  wait interrupted macpherson
sharply his face going white beneath
the tan wong tom you believe that
i did all of these things of which you
accuse me when i was irresponsible-
that i actually did them but have no
memory of them

  i believe that so firmly that i have
stood between you and the vengeance
which has sought you since you fled
from shen fun replied the china-
man

  and why should i have fled from
there what had i done

  for the first time wong tom be-
trayed a suspicion of weakness which
suggested fear he hesitated and his
oblique eyes shifted uneasily mr
macpherson that is the one thing which
i may not tell he said in a low voice
if it were generally known even i
could not save you and the conse-
quences to others might be terrible it
is known only to a very few of the
priests who guard the sanctuary of
the seal of confucius



shen fun to your subconscious mind
and to jenkinson

  jenkinson is alive

  wong tom shrugged his shoulders
he exists he said significantly he
knew only a part but even of that he
will never speak

  where is he demanded macpher-
son

  if you will do as i wish you will
see him answered wrong tom eva-
sively fifteen years ago you man-
aged by craft and the exercise of a
devilish ingenuity to get within the
walls of shen fun now i wish you to
return there with me

  one moment wong tom inter-
rupted winton i have not forgotten
that you saved my life at lang tun
and i believe that it was through your
influence that i was restored to liberty
may i ask if you were responsible for
the attack on the foreigners there

  i was not answered the chinaman
decisively for weeks i had known
that trouble was brewing and that an
outburst might come at any moment
wong tom mr macpherson will
accompany you said winton quietly

  who gave you the authority to an-
swer for me demanded macpherson
irritably

  common humanity for one thing
answered winton if it is permitted
i shall accompany you

  wong tom nodded assent it in-
creases my difficulties but it may also
contribute to the success of my plan
he said

  sternberg came forward eagerly
will you accept another volunteer
he asked not in my official capacity
he added hastily when he read denial
in the chinamans expression ill
cable my resignation if it is necessary
wong tom hesitated y-e-s you
may come he said with evident re-
luctance never mind your resigna-
tion mr sternberg if things go
wrong and i am unable to protect you
the star-spangled banner would not im-
press the shen fun mob gentlemen
we start at moonrise to-morrow there
will be a houseboat at the landing and
the launch can tow it

  macpherson looked ruefully from
one to the other i seem to be with-
out authority in my own house he
said perhaps dick has a few orders
to give me he turned toward where
the boy had stood in the shadows but
the corner was empty  dick had silently
vanished from the room

  your son is already on the way to
shen fun mr macpherson said
wong tom quietly in china a male
child is often hostage for his sire

chapter vi

  the boat which wong tom had pro-
vided was the last word in the way of
comfort and luxury it was sufficiently
large to permit of spacious quarters aft
for macpherson winton and stern-
berg amidships accommodations had
been provided for the white sailors and
forward separated from the passengers
by a stout bulkhead the native servants
and crew pigged in together as no other
people on the face of the earth could

 once on board the chinaman
dropped all pretense of the role of com-
prador and with a quiet dignity be-
came the most considerate and solici-
tous of hosts with wonderful tact and
unfailing courtesy he managed a situa-
tion which was not without difficulties
for from the very start the men whom
macpherson had insisted upon bringing
from the yacht threatened trouble

  niel the gigantic quartermaster was
the only real sailorman in the lot the
others as wong tom had asserted
were recruited from the gillies of mac-
phersons scottish estates and their
sole forecastle experience had been
gained on the passage out they were
undisciplined and without the ready
adaptability of the sailor and niel
whose temper did not belie his flaming
hair had cursed their awkwardness and
inefficiency so roundly and continuous-
ly that they had become morose and ir-
ritable much given to venting their
tempers in turn upon the native sail-
ors

  now the chinese sailors and stokers
on deep-water ships where they are
commanded by european officers are


the popular magazine

one thing the fresh-water sampan and
houseboat men of the inland rivers and
canals are another at the best they
are little better than pirates and human
life in china is remarkably cheap it
spoke volumes for the power of wong
tom that no man among that rascally
crew of cutthroats ventured to raise a
hand in protest but listening to their
chatter among themselves and the
shrill discordant chants with wthich
the- accompanied their wrork winton
appreciated that once his protecting
hand was removed they would exact a
bloody vengeance for the kicks and
curses which the highlanders dealt out
to them

  wong tom however made neither
complaint nor comment to macpherson
on the behavior of his followers from
the first it had been tacitly accepted by
the three foreigners that mention of
wrhat macpherson had done in shen
fun fifteen years before or of what
he was expected to do upon their ar-
rival there was taboo but of every-
thing else he spoke freely

 wong tom i have made myself
clay in your hands and i give you my
word that i shall go through with it
without a whimper said macpherson
quietly one day i ask only one thing
-the definite assurance that my wife
lives

  the chinaman hesitated for a mo-
ment there is no further reason for
concealment he answered finally tt
would have been unwise to have made
the acknowledgment before for we
knew what the consequences might
have been yes macpherson she lives
she has been tenderly guarded and
cared for and i can safely say that
this has been the happiest day of her
life your son was not sent to shen
fun as a hostage but as soon as i e-
ceived your pledge he was permitted
to go on an errand of mercy and to-
dar he knows for the first time a moth-
ers embrace

  it was a long journey from chee
nung to shen fun-long enough to im-
press upon sternberg the immensity of
the chinese empire of which he had
previously known but the fringe to

winton of course it was an old story
but macpherson found little in that
journey to remind him of his previous
experiences-a fact which puzzled him
not a little

  he knew that he must have covered
practically the same territory in his pre-
vious trip to lang tun but not a land-
mark could he recognize the weary
months of his captivity had been spent
in far-distant provinces and the up-
lands of the north are as different from
the river country of southern and cen-
tral china as is maine from the lower
mississippi valley in the north the
men had been of large stature their life
pastoral their cities separated by great
wastes of untilled lands here he trav-
eled for day after day through a coun-
try in which not a square inch of land
was left unoccupied by growing crops
drainage had reclaimed every swamp
and a skillfully devised scheme of irri-
gation had made the uplands fruitful
it was all as new to him as if he had
never visited china before and more
than anything else he was impressed by
the density of the population

  the mere mass of yellow humanity
seemed overpowering man for man
they were insignificant foemen when
contrasted with the giants of the north
but he knew that he must reckon with
them in the mass and not as individ-
uals hourly he had ocular demonstra-
tion of the density of that mass for the
progress of the launch with its heavy
tow wras necessarily slow and the news
of their coming evidently preceded
them at every lock the sides of the
canal were lined with thousands of cu-
rious natives and more than once the
eagerness of those in the rear ranks to
obtain sight of the foreign devils
caused scores of those in front to take
involuntarily baths in the yellow water

  there was never a sign of open hos-
tility displayed by the curious thou-
sands who stared at them-a condition
which winton from previous experi-
ence in inland travel knew to be most
unusual out of compliment to his
guests wong tom had caused both the
american and british ensigns to be
flown from staffs at the stern  but those
the seal of confucius



national symbols had no meaning for
the coolies and peasants who gazed in-
differently at them from the staff at
the bow fluttered another flag however
the ground of imperial yellow bearing
three intertwined circles of green red
and blue and that the multitude greet-
ed with every mark of awe and respect

  if it came to a question of flight
macphersons men would hamper him
because their numbers would attract at-
tention  and yet they were too few in
number to make effective resistance
against this human swarm he wished
heartily that they were back in chee
nung on the yacht-or better still in
their native highlands-for while they
had inherited the loyalty which would
make them follow him unquestioningly
in danger or to death he had inherited
the obligations which forbade him to
traffic needlessly with that feudal devo-
tion

  it was that sense of obligation which
finally caused him to go to wong tom
with the suggestion that the house boat
should finish its journey by sail and
hand power leaving the launch free to
carry his useless followers back to the
coast

  they will be in less danger if they
stay with us mr macpherson he said
if they are reasonable i can protect
them but they could never retrace this
voyage in safety alone every one of
them has done enough since we started
to earn a knife between his ribs but
no chinaman dares raise his hand
against even a foreigner beneath the
yellow flag with the intertwined circles
the meanest criminal in china would
be safe from the vengeance of tsi-ann
the empress dowager under its pro-
tection

  there is a flagstaff on the launch
suggested macpherson

 wong tom smiled as he shook his
head that would be piracy mr
macpherson he said sailing under
false colors wouldnt be much of a pro-
tection the flag in itself is valueless
it is what it represents

  and that is

  for a moment wong tom hesitated
and then proudly drew himself up to
a

his full height and that is the cus-
todian of the inner sanctuary of shen
fun-by virtue of his great office the
real power behind the dragon throne
he answered that is my flag so long
as i hold that office and in the eyes
of every follower of confucius it would
be sacrilege for another to use it there
is no reason for further concealment
so long as i live and retain my power
i am supreme in shen fun and he who
rules shen fun rules china

  macpherson for nearly fifteen years
this great empire has been virtually
without a ruler for in peking tsi-ann
has ridden unchecked and china is
headed for destruction i have played
for a great stake and some time within
the next few days i make the final
throw of the dice if i win you and
your friends are assured of protection
our wife and son will be restored to
you and you wtill be given safe escort
to the coast tsi-ann will tremble on
the dragon throne which she has
usurped and under my guidance china
wrill be saved from the dangers which
threaten her

  and if you lose asked macpher-
son quietly

  wong tom shrugged his shoulders
and made a gesture eloquent of help-
lessness then may my gods and your
god aid us he exclaimed we shall
be alone in shen fun for my power
would be gorte to-day my word is
law to millions if i fail i shall be of
less account than the meanest beggar
in china-powerless to save myself
and a menace rather than a protection
to my friends i am depending upon
you macpherson and i have faith that
i shall not be disappointed no-do
not attempt to question me for i can
tell you nothing i know that fifteen
years ago you were not yourself and in
a few hours of madness you did that
which had terrible consequences now
for a few hours you shall again be
mad that you may undo the harm which
you have done until the time comes
i can tell you no more

  macpherson had listened with in-
creasing bewilderment in his eyes and
that peculiar dazed expression had


the popular magazine

cme to his face again his hands were
raised to his forehead as if lie were
trying to brush away some impalpable
but mystifying veil

  yes-perhaps-it was madness in
india too he muttered that hor-
rible temple of juggernaut-the flight

-the trail of silver- his voice

sank lower and lower until it was
merely a whisper and the words which
came from his lips were those of a
strange language

  wong tom watched and listened in
silence then leaning forward he
placed his hands on macphersons
shoulders and shook him roughly

  no no not yet he exclaimed per-
emptorily

  macpherson started and quickly re-
covered himself but in his eyes was a
perplexed inquiry-the expression of a
man suddenly aroused from a deep
sleep and finding himself in strange sur-
roundings he glanced furtively about
the deck before looking at wong tom
-a respite wthich the chinaman deemed
fortunate for he knew that his face
had betrayed agitation in those few
seconds it had become as placid and in-
scrutable as ever and a pleasant and
reassuring smile played about his lips

  so i think that you will agree with
me that it is better they should go on
with us he said as if he were con-
tinuing a conversation of which mac-
pherson had in a moment of inattention
or drowsiness lost the thread for-
tune is notoriously fickle you know
mr macpherson and stranger things
have happened than that i should wel-
come the presence and aid of your wild
highlanders

  macpherson nodded assent very
well i expect that it is the only
chance he agreed it is reassuring to
find that we are all in the same boat
wong tom-that we must stand or fall
together

  the house boat was floating lazily
into one of the innumerable locks
which foot by foot had raised them
to the level where paddy fields com-
menced to be interspersed with patches
of millet and here and there the bril-

liant hues of poppies broke the vast
expanse of waving green the clumsy
ponderous gates swung together behind
them and the water from the spillway
rushed in to raise them to the upper
level wong tom made no answer un-
til the shaded deck on which they sat
was even with the stone coping of the
lock then he rose from his chair and
beckoning macpherson to follow him
he walked to the rail

  gathered at the edge was the usual
crowd of chattering gesticulating na-
tives pushing and crowding to get a
closer view of the pale-faced foreign-
ers  but at the sight of wong tom
their shrill clamoring hushed to imme-
diate and absolute silence and a single
gesture with his outstretched hand suf-
ficed to start them backward even more
eagerly than they had pushed and strug-
gled to get in the front rank in a sur-
prisingly short time that great mob had
so effectually dispersed itself that from
the deck was offered a clear and un-
obstructed view of the surrounding
country and raising his hand the
chinaman pointed to a range of low
hills which edged the eastern horizon

  there lies shen fun mr macpher-
son he said gravely to-morrow at
daybreak we should be able to see
plainly the outer walls until we reach
them there will be little which differs
from the country through which we
have passed but once within the gates
of the outer city you must be prepared
to see much which will shock western
eyes

  but still you intend to take us
through will it mean fighting inter-
rupted macpherson im not afraid
for myself wong tom but i have
come here for a purpose and that will
not be advanced if i am knocked on the
head is your power great enough to
give us safe conduct

  a very positive no to your first
question replied the chinaman it
would not be fighting it would be anni-
hilation a massacre if such an entrance
as you have pictured in your mind were
attempted you and those who accom-
pany you will enter the outer gates as
my prisoners and none save myself will
the seal of confucius



have the slightest stispicion that it is
planned for you to come out alive

  macpherson had listened in blank
amazement and he greeted the con-
clusion with a derisive laugh are you
serious do you believe for a moment
that we shall trust ourselves in there
without weapons in our hands  he de-
manded

  wong tom gravely inclined his head
but before he could make verbal an-
swer macpherson walked to the com-
paniomvay which led to the cabin where
sternberg and winton sat absorbed
over a chessboard

  come up here you fellows and lis-
ten to this he called and when they
reached the deck he repeated the gist
of the conversation for their benefit
and even if we should be idiotic
enough to consent can you see niel
and his men submitting docilely to even
a pretense of being herded as prisoners
by chinamen he concluded

  wong toni had listened patiently
and he spoke before the others could
answer

  there is no question of that he
said and there was that in his voice
which recalled to sternberg wintons
prophecy of the iron hand officially
i am dealing with you alone mr mac-
pherson and i shall hardly need to re-
mind you of your promise to me that
you would submit your will to my judg-
ment you must go with me to the
sanctuary ami for your own safety it
is necessary for you to go as my pris-
oner that applies equally to any for-
eigner who accompanies you and you
have acknowledged that even your au-
thority could not make your men sub-
mit to that it is therefore a self-evi-
dent fact that they may not enter shen
fun and i may say that i have never
intended to permit them to

  this is my plan to-morrow after-
noon you three gentlemen will land with
me at the point on the canal which is
nearest to shen fun which means a
land journey of ten miles before that
you must impress upon your highland-
ers the fact that any further indiscre-
tion on their part will lead to their de-
struction it will be far better if they

remain under cover in their own quar-
ters

  the launch will keep on with this
house boat towing it through canals
which i shall indicate which will bring
it in two days to a point midway be-
tween shen fun and lang tun and
there it will remain until you rejoin it
you three gentlemen will enter shen
fun as my prisoners if mr winton
and mr sternberg still wish to con-
tinue he paused and looked inquir-
ingly at them

  please go on  let us have the rest
of it said winton  e havent come
this far to back out without reason

  very well but i warn you that it
will be a trying experience continued
wong tom seriously once inside of
the walls which surround the sacred
precincts you will be safe and free
from annoyance until we reach there
i can guarantee only your personal
safety for the mob is fanatical and in
spite of my protection you will be sub-
jected to jeers and insult but when
we have entered the sacred gate you
gentlemen will be liberated mr mac-
pherson alone will remain my prisoner
-on parole it is true but absolutely
subject to my orders to you mr
winton and to mr sternberg will be
intrusted the safety of lady lochineal
her son will guide you and you will
escort her to this boat there are the
broad lines of the plan the rest is only
a matter of detail

chapter vii

  in the distance shen fun looked very
like any one of the dozen walled cities
which they had passed on the voyage
but as they neared its gates the three
adventurers distinguished one striking
difference the massive medieval walls
and flanking towers had been kept in
scrupulous repair and the glint of sun-
shine on steel at regular intervals on
the walls suggested that the watch and
ward was still vigilantly maintained

  in this last stage of the journey there
had been nothing to arouse their ap-
prehension  chairs had been in wait-
ing for them when they landed from


the cpopulacr magazine

the house boat and swung on the
shoulders of powerful coolie bearers
they had been swiftly and comfortably
transported across the level plain over
which the battlemented hilltops of the
city frowned

  a hundred yards from the main gate
the bearers halted and lowered their
burdens and obeying a gesture from
wong tom the foreigners stepped out
of their chairs and joined him

  one last word of caution for your
own safety gentlemen he said impres-
sively i know that you are armed
but-no matter what happens-you
must trust in me to protect you and
make no show of resistance

  there was no time for more for no
human voice would have been audible
above the discordant blare of horns
and trumpets which suddenly came
from the vaulted gateway and a mo-
ment later it seemed as if the entire
population of shen fun must be empty-
ing itself through that narrow passage
the column mushroomed and spread
as it reached the open space before the
gate and then swept toward them-a
shrieking gesticulating billow of men-
acing fanatics for a moment there
was a shade of doubt and anxiety on
wong toms face but it gave wtay
quickly to stern determination and
jumping up on the seat of his chair he
raised his hand and made an imperious
gesture no shouted command would
have carried and nothing less than a
barrier of stone could have stopped the
oncoming rush but the sight of that
upraised hand apparently inspired a
measure of awe and within a yard of
them the human billow split and di-
vided swirling about the chair and the
three men who instinctively clung to it
as the surf breaks and lashes about an
isolated pinnacle of rock

  even to winton who had perfect
command of classical chinese and a
working knowledge of most of the dia-
lects the shouts and cries were unin-
telligible  but there was no mistaking
the hatred which the fierce intonations
conveyed nor the cruelty and blood
lust stamped on the hideously distorted
yellow faces which surrounded them

  wrong tom was quick to take ad-
vantage of the respite and his voice
rang out sonorously above the shrill
falsetto cries of the fanatics his
words too were those of a language
unknown to his companions but there
could be no question of the speech com-
ing from the tongue of one accustomed
to speak it with authority and a master
of invective and those unlucky enough
to be in the front rank shrank back as
if they were menaced with a whip the
clear space about the chair grew grad-
ually larger as the human tide receded
under his fierce denunciation but while
the cries were stilled and the threat-
ening gestures ceased there was no
lessening of the hatred expressed on
the yellow faces

  for the moment they had apparently
yielded from the habit of a long obe-
dience imposed by fear but it was a
sullen yielding and wong tom wise
from the experience of years of power
wasted no precious second of the brief
minutes which his fierce tirade had
gained the coolies who had carried
them from the house boat had been
swtallowred and lost in the mob and the
chairs in which the foreigners had rid-
den smashed and trampled into shape-
less wreckage but that on which the
chinaman stood was intact swiftly his
eyes searched the ring of sullen scowl-
ing faces which surrounded them and
unerringly singling out the four most
prominent leaders he beckoned them
forward and pointed to the long bam-
boo carrying poles

  in the instant of hesitation which fol-
lowed the silence of the mob was bro-
ken by a venomous sibilant hiss which
in the east is ever the forerunner of
more violent protest and no interpreter
was needed to tell the three foreigners
that their lives hung by the slenderest
of threads winton familiar with the
distinctions of native dress which mark
to a nicety the wearers station in life
knew that wong tom had selected the
four men of greatest wealth and posi-
tion in the motley crowd-men who
would consider the coolies task to
which his eyes invited them a degrada-
tion their clothing was fashioned
the seal of confucius



from the finest silk and the hideously
long finger nails protected from break-
ing by cunningly devised sheaths of
gold proclaimed that their hands were
never soiled by manual labor

 wong tom had shrewdly drawn a
herring across the hot scent upon which
they were urged by their ferocity and
lust for torture and until they dared
again to follow flesh they would be
content to harry fish perhaps it was
more a desire to inflict humiliation and
suffering than fear of wong tom
which influenced them but in any case
they were quick to grasp the possibili-
ties which the situation offered it
would be vastly amusing to see those
soft-living merchants groaning and
bending under the burdens which tjie
backs of many of them knew only too
well and a single jeering suggestion
from one of the chair coolies who had
wriggled to the rear of the crowd was
enough to change the mood from one
of protest to a ribald but effective ap-
proval to the accompaniment of
mocking laughter jeers and coarse
jests the merchants were unceremoni-
ously and relentlessly pressed forward
and forced to assume the unaccustomed
burden

  there was just the suggestion of a
grim smile about wong toms lips as
he settled himself comfortably in the
chair and under cover of the noisy
merriment of the mob which forgot for
the moment its more important busi-
ness in enjoying the discomfort and
humiliation of its recent leaders he
spoke in english to his companions

  stand fast and whatever happens
keep close to this chair he said hur-
riedly i cant explain for i do not
know what has happened but there has
been treachery or these dogs would
never dare to snap at those under my
protection make no resistance unless
i give you the word but if that word
is spoken it will be a fight to the death
and it will be a mercy to you if you
die fighting i have won the first skir-
mish but the real test will come within
the walls you can best aid me to pro-
tect you by remaining absolutely pas-
sive

  there was no time for questioning or
suggestion for the chair had reached
the gateway and on the shoulders of
its unskillful bearers it rocked peril-
ously above the heads of those who
crowded and jostled about it in the nar-
row passage through the massive wall

  once within the city wrong tom half
raised himself in the swaying chair
and as he settled back into the seat he
shot a warning glance at winton who
had already guessed the cause of his
uneasiness like all chinese cities
shen fun was a network of narrow
twisting lanes between high buildings
and filthy beyond anything conceivable
to western imagination but leading
from the main gateway in the outer
wall was one exceptionally wide thor-
oughfare of perhaps a quarter of a
mile in length-the celebrated path of
the million beatitudes which had been
planned to permit unobstructed passage
to the sacred precincts for the great
spring and autumn pilgrimages to the
holy shrines

  but now that broad street through
which the chinaman had planned to
convey his companions quickly to the
safety of the sanctuary was blocked
from end to end and side to side by
a solid mass of humanity there was
no hostile demonstration but no barri-
cade bristling with cannon could more
effectually have barred passage than did
that silent mass of immovable human
beings wong tom was quick to read
the significance of the blockade and
sharply commanded his amateur bear-
ers to turn to the right

  and then began a progress which in
reality was worse than any of the
nightmares which for years had made
macpherson and winton look forward
with dread to the coming of darkness
for clinging to the chair the three ad-
venturers were crowded with it into the
opening of one of the filthy malodorous
alleyways

  there was no thought of resistance
in the minds of the trio who clung des-
perately to the bamboo carrying poles
they were so tightly packed in with
the screaming jabbering natives that
they could not have struck a blow if


the cpocpular magazine

they would and they dared not loosen
their holds on the poles for fear of
being trampled into the filthy mud

  in such madness there was no meas-
uring of time for every minute seemed
an eternity but while the advance was
slow it was always an advance for the
pressure from behind permitted of no
halting and bad as had been the
progress the ending of it promised no
relief for there could be no mistaking
the peculiar uses to which the open
space in which the narrow slum ter-
minated was devoted it was the exe-
cution ground of the city

 at the eastern boundary of the
square the city wall rose sheer and un-
pierced by openings and spread-eagled
on its gray face wrere more than a
score of human bodies blackened and
mummified by long exposure to the
weather but sufficiently preserved by
skillful embalming to retain the unmis-
takable characteristics of caucasian
origin

 macphersons face grew white and
he would have attacked the yellow
men had not winton and sternberg
gripped his arms

 stand fast you fool exclaimed
winton harshly this is no time to
think of exacting vengeance for the
past look and you will see for your-
self that we have troubles enough in the
present as he spoke he wheeled him
sharply around to face a far corner of
the square from which a chorus of
mocking cries and derisive cheers an-
nounced the coming of fresh food for
the merriment of the crowd

 	it was a curious figure which was
being impelled toward them by a noisy
gang of urchins-a man bent double
by the weight of a great kang fash-
ioned from thick planks of teakwood
it was at least five feet square and
only the bearers head which protruded
through the hole in the center of it
was visible for its lower edge barely
missed the filthy stone pavement of the
square and like a curtain concealed
the motive power of the cumbersome
frame he managed the unwieldy am-
bulatory pillory with an ease and dex-
terity which told of long confinement

in its inexorable embrace however and
dodging the blows and missiles aimed
at his defenseless shaven pate by the
cruel escort of ragamuffins from the
slums he crossed the intervening space
with incredible speed and came to a
halt with the edge of the heavy kang
resting on the ground in front of the
chair on which wong tom still sat en-
throned

  there was abject terror in the eves
which were raised to wong toms face
and almost instantly the cries of the
mob hushed to silence as the ranks
strained forward listening greedily for
a sentence to some new form of tor-
ture for the poor wretch but the
chinaman remained silent and furtive-
ly those eyes wandered to the faces of
the men gathered about his chair on
sternberg who was gazing at him as
a man hypnotized they rested but an
instant on winton little longer but
when they met those of macpherson
and read in them the recognition which
was struggling with horror a hoarse
inarticulate cry came from his lips and
he started forward so violently that the
heavy kang would have dragged him to
the ground had not macpherson jumped
toward him and steadied it

  jenkinson by all thats holy and
he has lived in that devils collar for
fifteen years exclaimed wtinton as
he too started forward but sternberg
grasped his arm with one hand and
with the other pointed at the two faces
which were now close together with
the black surface of the kang as a back-
ground

  great heaven man dont you see
the likeness he gasped jenkinson
and a half-caste it may be but so mac-
phersons face would look had he en-
dured a half as much

  wrinton stared incredulously but
there was no denying the evidence of
his eyes jenkinson the fence of
hongkong had been a gross fat half-
caste the native blood far more in evi-
dence than that of the unknown cau-
casian who had fathered him but
years of suffering and privation had
fined down the coarseness of the orien-
tal inheritance and there was no mis-
the seal of confucius



taking the startling likeness of his face
to that of the man who fifteen years
before had been associated with him in
such a mysterious way and had come
with him to this very city of shen fun

chapter viii

  as a man possessed of devils of rage
and violence macpherson hammered
and wrenched with his bare hands at
the clumsy locks which fastened the
hinged halves of the kang about the
captives neck the half-caste meanwhile
uttering strange uncouth cries which
for all the meaning they conveyed might
have been either encouragement or pro-
test wong tom who had given no
sign that he had noticed the likeness
between macpherson and the face
which like a hideous caricature gib-
bered and mouthed the unintelligible
screams and howls watched the futile
contest of muscle against iron with a
grim smile on his lips and answered
wintons glance of mute inquiry with a
shrug of his shoulders

  there was little time for explana-
tion for the natives as if fearing that
even against such odds macpherson
might succeed in robbing them of the
victim who for years had furnished
them amusement in their idle moments
pressed forward menacingly

  perhaps it was as well that neither
winton nor sternberg understood the
few shouted words with which wong
tom halted abruptly that threatening
advance-words which the mob greeted
with shrill cries of approval and which
were taken up by those in the front
ranks and shouted back until like an
echo they were repeated from the nar-
row lanes packed with those who were
unable to force entrance to the crowded
square

  wong tom inactive but alert sat
quietly in his chair listening to the
repetition of his words which seemed
to grow into a chanting supplication
or summons to some unseen power
and watching macpherson who soon
became convinced that his mad efforts
were hopeless and stood gazing at his
torn and bleeding hands that same fa-

miliar look of bewilderment upon his
face

  it seemed an impossibility that any-
thing save a battering-ram could win a
passageway through the tightly packed
mob which surrounded them but ap-
pearances are traditionally deceitful
and a swaying of the dense throng ac-
companied by cries of welcome in spite
of the added -discomfort announced
the coming of those for whom there
had been such insistent clamor

  slowly a narrow gangway opened
from one of the streets at a far cor-
ner of the execution ground and
through it advanced a half dozen men
the leader such a giant in stature that
his shoulders rose above the bobbing
heads which struggled about him
fierce yelps of approval marked their
progress but a profound silence fell
over the throng as the gigantic figure
reached the freedom of the open space
about the chair and with every mark of
respect kotowed before wong tom
behind him his followers gathered as
they succeeded in wriggling free from
the crowd and a more villainous aggre-
gation of human brutes it would be im-
possible for even the slums of a chi-
nese city to breed

  there could be no mistaking their
vocation the great two-handed sword
which hung at the leaders back its
polished hilt rising above his left shoul-
der was of a pattern never designed
for honorable combat and the use of
the scourges thongs and peculiar im-
plements carried by his men was ob-
vious

  for the first time doubt of wong
tom came to wintons mind and his
hand dropped from the arm of the chair
to a side pocket of his tunic with-
out taking his eyes from the huge exe-
cutioner who was rising to his feet
after his obeisance the chinaman
leaned over and placed his fingers on
the americans shoulder

  patience winton he said quietly
i have not played falsely i have seen
what you have seen and i know that
it is necessary to save that dog from
the kang get hold of macpherson and
make him understand if you can i

am fighting for minutes and a sec-
onds rashness may ruin our chances
it was the feel of the mans fingers on
his shoulder which reassured winton
more than his words for there was no
suggestion of fear in that firm steady
touch and it was that rather than
treachery of which he had been appre-
hensive

  even as the chinaman gave his or-
ders to the executioner he stepped for-
ward and took a firm grasp of mac-
phersons arm aided by sternberg who
pinioned him from the other side

  it was well that the consul had come
to his assistance for roused from his
strange bewilderment by a piercing
shriek of terror from the half-caste
macpherson struggled fiercely to break
away and go to his assistance the
executioner had passed wong toms
quietly given instructions to his crew
and with quick obedience they had
grasped the heavy kang giving small
heed to the cries of its miserable pris-
oner as they jerked it about in their
efforts to unfasten the locks rusted by
years of disuse one by one they gave
way and fell clattering on the stone
pavement and just as the two ameri-
cans succeeded in forcing macpherson
back beside wong toms chair the two
halves parted and jenkinson free for
the first time in many years from that
cruel yoke of wood and iron pitched
forward on his face and lay writhing
at their feet

  a couple of the executioners men
darted forward to lay hold of him but
at a sharp command from wong tom
they drew back and jenkinson made
hopeful when a minute had passed and
his head still remained upon his shoul-
ders struggled awkwardly to his feet

  naked save for a ragged breechcloth
he was a sufficiently grotesque figure
as he swayed and staggered in a vain
attempt to gain his balance his great
muscles which had been developed and
hardened by the burden of the kang
had learned to accommodate themselves
automatically to its ever-shifting weight
and balance but now could not serve
and coordinate in the sudden freedom
the half-caste could neither stand erect

nor without the accustomed weight on
his calloused neck and shoulders main-
tain the stooping position to which he
had been so long condemned as help-
less as an infant essaying its first steps
he lurched and swayed falling heavily
when he would advance and rolling
helplessly when he strove to rise with-
out the support of the pillory for which
he instinctively stretched out his great
muscular arms

  in that spectacle f helplessness the
crowd for a time found such amuse-
ment that its desire for a bloodier dem-
onstration was forgotten but wong
tom was not lulled to any sense of
false security

  leaning forward in his chair he gave
a sharp command to the bearers whose
services he had impressed the na-
tives gazed at him wonderingly as his
chair was again swung shoulder-high
but the executioner who had stood ex-
pectantly with his sword of office rest-
ing in the hollow of his arm stepped
forward and motioned to his men to
draw about him

  even then the mob had no suspicion
of his real purpose and evidently be-
lieved that he was simply withdrawing
to the sanctuary and leaving the in-
truders to be dealt with after the man-
ner prescribed by immemorial tradition
but when at his low-voiced command
winton leaned over and steadied the
incoordinate movements of the half-
caste with a supporting hand and mac-
pherson and sternberg moved forward
with the chair a fierce howl of protest
rose from the human wall which cir-
cled them and the executioner his face
black with anger placed himself men-
acingly in their path his attendants
trained by long and constant practice
to anticipate his wishes and to act with-
out spoken orders jumped forward
and grabbed for the stooping shoulders
of the half-caste for their master his
feet planted wtide apart and his eyes
fixed on that calloused neck was mak-
ing the sword whistle as its keen edge
described great circles about his head

  the bearers with cries of fear halt-
ed abruptly and disregarding wong
toms protest macpherson and stern-
the seal of confucius



berg jumped forward to wintons as-
sistance as he stood his ground against
the threatening attack a defiance which
was obviously hopeless even with their
backing but as if the touch of win-
ton s hand had roused a long-forgotten
memory of his inheritance of caucasian
blood the oriental fatalism which had
enabled him to endure so long his cruel
burden was banished from the half-
castes mind and with that aroused
memory seemed to come a new-found
mastery of the great strength developed
by management of the kang for just
a moment he had drawn his crouching
body back as if in fear but it was in
reality a preparation for a spring which
sent him forward like a human mis-
sile from a catapult the impact of his
calloused shoulders toppling over the
headsmans jackals without in the least
diminishing his speed

  before the astonished executioner
could strike the shaven pate had taken
him fairly in the chest and the sword
clattered to the pavement as he went
down with the clutch of the sinewy
hands at his throat his protruding eyes
staring for the last time at the evi-
dences of his bloody handiwork which
seemed to mock at him from the scaf-
folding above

  the very inability to stand erect
which had made the half-caste an ob-
ject for their ridicule when he had first
been released from the kang now op-
erated to make him a dangerous antag-
onist from the very novelty of his
method of attack for maddened by his
first taste of vengeance for all these
years of suffering and humiliation his
one desire was to maim and kill grasp-
ing in one hand the hilt of the heads-
mans sword he steadied himself with
the tips of the fingers of the other on
the pavement and as he plunged for-
ward the great blade swung in threat-
ening semicircles

  probably never in the history of hu-
man combats had there been such an
attack and certainly nothing in the ex-
perience of the shen fun mob had
taught an effective parry for it had
he stood erect there would have been
opportunity to rush in and bear him

down after the first stroke but more
like an ape than a man he came at
them in great leaps

  wnh the death of the executioner
wong tom realized that any hope of
the efficacy of moral suasion had van-
ished and even before the half-caste
had started his mad attack he had given
the long-delayed command to his com-
panions to fight without the slight-
est compunction winton had shot the
only two of the executioners men who
had not been disabled in jenkinsons
charge and macpherson and sternberg
were discouraging attack from the rear
by careful shooting wvhile the china-
man with an automatic pistol which
he had drawn from his voluminous
sleeve held his terrified bearers to the
faithful performance of their unwel-
come task

  onward into the crowd the half-caste
plunged with his apelike leaps the
heavy weapon in his powerful grasp
shearing through flesh and bone and
mowing a broad path to the very edge
of the square

  panting and with his bronzed skin
glistening with sweat the half-caste
paused after gaining the entrance of the
street through which wong tom hoped
to gain the sanctuary balancing him-
self with the point of the bloodstained
sword resting on the pavement the
portion of the square through which
he had literally mowed his way was
deserted by all save the wounded and
dead and in front of him the narrow
street was emptied of all human occu-
pants

  bravely fought jenkinson you
have saved the day exclaimed win-
ton as he placed his hand on the cal-
loused shoulder which reached almost
to his waist never mind the others
our friends can hold them off when
they get to this narrow lane you must
know every twist and turn in this hole
of a city and you can best serve us by
showing us the shortest cut to the sanc-
tuary the half-caste looked up at
him and with foam-flecked lips mum-
bled an inarticulate reply but he made
no move to obey

  oh of course-you have forgotten


the popular magazine

your english-and small wonder ex-
claimed winton and then in the can-
tonese dialect he repeated his request
still the half-caste remained immov-
able but again he essayed to make ver-
bal answer and winton who had
leaned forward to catch his words
drew back his eyes distended with hor-
ror

  the devils the cruel devils he
exclaimed pityingly for in the distorted
syllables which came from the half-
castes mouth he had recognized an at-
tempt at english but they were almost
unintelligible for lack of a tongue to
form them he remembered wong
toms statement which when it was
made had puzzled him that jenkinson
lived but would never tell of what he
knew and had only his own safety
been concerned he would have re-
mained passive when he saw the half-
castes hand tighten on the sword hilt
as the chair drew near

  wait jenkinson this is no time
to think of private vengeance he
warned there is serious business be-
fore us-the rescue of macphersons
wife who is a prisoner in the sacred
precincts you must be patient and
aid us for without wong tom we can
never gain admittance

  a curious gleam came to jenkinsons
eyes as he listened no possible com-
bination of letters could give adequate
idea of the sounds which came from
that mutilated mouth but with wits
and ears sharpened by danger winton
managed to get an inkling of his mean-
ing-that even with wong toms help
entrance to the sanctuary would be im-
possible for every gate had been seized
by newly arrived imperial troops and
then as clearly and distinctly as if his
tongue had not been torn out he ended
with a single terse statement his voice
so loud that it carried even above the
clamor of the crowd to wong toms
ears

  tsi-ann knows all

  little as that shrill announcement
conveyed to the foreigners the visible
effect upon wong tom was greater
than had been produced by the inex-
plicable and threatening revolt of the

shen funese he started violently and
barely waiting until the clumsy chair-
men had obeyed his quick command to
lower he jumped from his seat and
hurried to the crouching half-caste

  is that true he demanded sternly
for just a moment jenkinson cringed
but the fear bred by years of habit
quickly vanished perhaps because he
read a greater terror behind the china-
mans eyes and more erect than he had
stood since his neck had known the
crushing burden of the kang he faced
him defiantly the harsh soundwhich
came from his throat needed no inter-
pretation for the hatred and exultation
in his eyes confirmed wong toms
worst fears and the chinamans sallow
face went ghastly white

 gentlemen we have but one
chance he gasped wre must reach
the sanctuary if we have to tear our
way through shen fun with our bare
hands to get there if the dowagers
troops arrive ahead of us-

 they are already there wong
tom interrupted winton alarmed by
an increase of the hostile cries from
the square which told of a gathering
of fresh courage by the mob jenkin-
son has told me that they hold the
gates but still we had better try to
reach them id rather take chances
with the soldiers than with the mob
and we cant stay here

  right you are uncle charley
agreed sternberg who had remained
by the deserted chair using its back to
steady his aim as he fired at the threat-
ening semicircle the brutes are get-
ting their second wind and preparing
for a rush

  the chinaman stood hopelessly ir-
resolute but after one glance up the
narrow street winton grasped him by
the arm and shouted for the others to
follow as he dragged him along

  at length recovering from their
stupefaction the mob raced swiftly
through the narrow thoroughfare and
searched eagerly every kennel and mal-
odorous lane which led from it but
they could find no trace of the man
who for fifteen years had been their
butt for their cruel jests the hated
the seal of confucius



foreign devils whom they had planned
to kill with many lingering tortures
and the bonze who had so treacherously
planned to destroy their means of live-
lihood by a foul desecration of the sa-
cred shrines

  dusk was already gathering but
great torches of resinous wood were
hastily procured and until far into the
night the search continued but as com-
pletely as if the earth had opened and
swallowed them their victims had dis-
appeared and only a score of dead men
on the filthy pavement of the execution
square were left as evidence of their
visit

chapter ix

  in the precipitate flight the leader-
ship which had tacitly been accorded
to wong tom since they left the house
boat was lost for less active than the
foreigners he became almost a dead
weight in wintons grasp-a handicap
which as the event proved was for-
tunate as it disturbed the americans
ordinarily accurate aim shooting as
he ran winton had emptied the cham-
ber of one revolver at a single figure
which apparently threatened to block
their escape before he recognized that
the excited gestures were meant as an
incentive to their own speed and that
the supposed foeman was in reality the
boj who had so mysteriously disap-
peared from the bungalow in chee
nung on the night of that last fateful
conference

  for just a moment dick looked sus-
piciously at the grotesque figure of the
half-caste but the howls of the chi-
nese forbade dallying for investigation
and calling to them to follow he darted
around the turn the fugitives close on
his heels fortunately the lane on
which they had entered was devoted to
godowns those solid warehouses which
the chinese merchants use to protect
their most valuable goods from fire and
theft and not a window pierced the
massive walls of masonry which bor-
dered it

  here and there a small postern closed
by iron-bound and bolt-studded doors

of heavy teak gave access to the mag-
azines within and it was one of these
which opened to the pressure of the
boys shoulder revealing a narrow
stone-vaulted passage leading to a small
interior courtyard dick closed the
door as the half-caste leaped through
the passageway behind the others and
noiselessly shot the great bolts which
secured it as the leaders of the pursu-
ing pack swept past with shrill cries
of rage and hatred

  a moment later he joined the pant-
ing fugitives who stood together in the
courtyard a small space littered with
bales of merchandise which was grate-
fully quiet and peaceful after the riot
from which they had emerged but
there was gruesome evidence that vio-
lence had penetrated even here on that
mad day for the walls were flecked
with blood and stretched on the stone
pavement lay the body of a chinaman
clothed more richly than the coolies of
the mob

  dick has he told the truth your
mother lives-you have seen her
panted macpherson eagerly as the boy
joined them dick nodded gravely and
even in his anxiety sternberg noted
that there was a subtle change in his
face-a softening of that oriental cyni-
cism which had given to it such a look
of premature age

  yes dad i have been with her for
nearly a week in the sacred precincts
he answered she is well and she was
perfectly safe when i left her at day-
break this morning a hundred ques-
tions struggled for precedence on mac-
phersons tongue but winton checked
them with a hand laid gently on his
shoulder

  wait macpherson he said quietly
that we know that jose-lady loch-
ineal is safe must satisfy you for the
present wong tom who had re-
gained enough of his breath to gasp a
question came forward also but win-
ton unceremoniously silenced him with
a gesture

  where are we dick he asked

of a mess mr winton answered
dick after i left you in chee nung
everything went smoothly and exactly
as wtong tom had planned until this
morning i traveled much faster than
you did and reached shen fun six days
ago finding the city as quiet and order-
ly as i had ever known it to be during
the years that i lived here i had never
before been admitted to the sacred
precincts and even now i have seen
no more of it than the walled garden
which surrounds my mothers house
but absolute peace and quiet reigned
there until last night when the bonzes
suddenly commenced to buzz about like
swarming bees wong tom at day-
break this morning cen yung the
bonze whom you have always warned
me to mistrust came to my mothers
house and demanded to see me he
told me to reach you and warn you that
tsi-ann had defied your authority and
sent her favorite eunuch lat kee with
orders to take your head to peking
several banners of the imperial guard
escorted him and they have seized all
of the gates of the sacred precincts

  and this place-it is secure de-
manded winton we are safe here
until we can plan some means of res-
cuing your mother and escaping from
the city the boy shrugged his shoul-
ders as he looked about the court

  you know as much about that as i
do he replied i never saw it until
an hour ago but from the placard on
the door i imagine that it belongs to
the silk merchants tong when the
mob crowded you away from the path
of the million beatitudes i guessed
your destination and i knew that if
you escaped from the execution ground
wong tom would endeavor to reach
the sacred precincts through this lane
so i waited here for you

  i can only guess what happened be-
fore i stumbled in here but i imagine
that thieves took advantage of the ex-
citement in the city to attempt robbery
when sing fen-he pointed at the
body-came to select goods from his
warehouse i noticed the door swing-
ing open and entered for i knew that
you would escape from the mob only

to fall into the hands of the soldiers
unless you could find a hiding place
the hatchet men had already killed
sing fen when i entered and they
were busy finishing their work with his
porters in his warehouse they are in
there yet they had foolishly left no
one on guard and i slammed and
locked the door before they discovered
me

  but we must be out of here before
midnight exclaimed wong tom my
only chance lies in getting inside the
sacred precincts before daylight in
an hour i can have the mob with me
instead of against me if-

  wong tom you just restrain your
enthusiasm and remember that youve
been reduced to the ranks interrupted
sternberg impatiently i reckon weve
had about all of the demonstration of
your ability to handle that mob that
we are liable to get uncle charley
you know more about this business than
you have ever let on and i guess its
up to you to boss the job from now
on

  its certainly up to me to get infor-
mation agreed winton as he turned
grim of face on the chinaman see
here wong tom we have played the
game according to ployle but you
havent been able to make good ill
admit that it wasnt your fault but that
does not make your failure any less dis-
astrous for us now im going to ask
you a few questions and i want
straight plain answers we have only
had so much of your story as you chose
to tell us now you will be good
enough to fill in the gaps and tell us
the parts you omitted just what mac-
pherson did fifteen years ago and just
what you expected him to do if wre
reached the sacred precincts

  wong tom looked at him defiantly
and if i refuse he demanded

  then it will be a toss-up as to
whether we turn jenkinson loose on
you or shut you up in that vault with
the choice assortment of your fellow
citizens that dick trapped answered
winton grimly see here wong tom
-i am not blaming you for what has
happened and im pretty sure that you
the seal of confucius



can give a reasonable explanation x
should advise you to try

  i can-to a reasonable man who
knows as much of china as you do
answered wong tom after a short
deliberation during which his eyes had
searched furtively the faces of his com-
panions mr winton you know that
this great loose-jointed country is held
together as an empire solely by a com-
mon religion-that in fact religion and
government are synonymous tsi-ann
rules nominally as the emperors re-
gent only so long as the priests give
her writ authority outside of the pink
walls of the forbidden city the man
who rules the priesthood rules china
for without him tsi-anns authority
would extend only so far as her wretch-
ed army could enforce it and at a
word from the bonzes that army would
melt away ike snow before the mon-
soon

  the chief bonze of all china has for
many hundreds of years been the cus-
todian of the seal of confucius that
piece of jade engraved with the three
intertwined circles is of less intrinsic
value than the golden signet which you
wear on your finger but it is venerated
by every chinaman from the meanest
to the highest as the holiest relic of
the great teacher for centuries the
chinese rulers have acknowledged the
power of its custodian who is the spir-
itual head of the empire and more than
once in our history he has used that
power to change the temporal rulers
and even dynasties fifteen years ago
the arrogance of tsi-ann threatened
china with destruction the reason for
it all is a matter of palace history of
intrigues and plotting within the for-
bidden city which would not interest
you  but even the foreigners resident in
the country were aware of the wide
unrest and disorder throughout the em-
pire

  yes i remember that there was
grave trouble then that all of the south-
ern provinces were threatening revolt
assented winton

  and you could have read only the
surface signs the hidden part was
even greater until such a crisis existed

  that i the custodian of the seal re-
moved the sacred relic from its shrine
in the sacred precincts and journeyed
with it to peking to demand the abdi-
cation of the dowager from the dragon
throne continued wong tom bitter-
ly and then i was weak enough to
listen to tsi-anns protestations and
promises and to defer action only to
learn what i had come there believing
-that the woman is a devil and served
by devils her expressions of grati-
tude knew no bounds and when we de-
parted she heaped honors and riches
upon us but we were not more than
three hours march from the walls of
peking when our party was set upon
and practically annihilated by her mer-
cenaries i alone escaped for even
those butchers venerated the sacred
relic which they had come to steal for
her that possessing it she might defy
the authority of the bonzes

  i knew that tsi-ann would use
every artifice to intercept my return to
shen fun for she must realize that
once safe within its walls i would issue
the proclamations bearing the seal of
confucius which would consign her to
the oblivion which she had so richly
deserved i knew that my only chance
was in secret flight but tsi-ann
shrewdly guessed the route i would
follow practically the only one which
was open to me

  mr winton you knew the hong-
kong of fifteen years ago and you will
remember the position which jenkin-
son occupied he was a half-caste
despised by both of the races which
had contributed to his being an out-
cast from the whites and tolerated by
the vilest of the chinese only because
he was a ready tool in their rascality

  but in just such a creature tsi-ann
found the weapon she needed to dtf her
devils work-a mongrel who would
have none of the reverence which would
make the vilest chinaman shrink back
at the last minute from a sacrilege
which would invoke the curses of the
gods on his ancestors an outcast held
in such contempt by the foreigners that
he could gain neither attention nor cre-
dence if he tried to turn his theft to his


the pocpulacr magazine

  own greater advantage by betraying his
employers gold meant everything to
him but little to the woman with the
revenues of china in her grasp and he
was liberally supplied with it to en-
able him to recruit the gang of river
pirates whom he would need to seize
the steamer on which i traveled for
tsi-ann had ordered that no innocent
witness to the theft and my murder
should be left alive to tell tales

  and now gentlemen comes the part
which puzzled me for many years and
for which i have only guessed the real
reason since jenkinson and mr mac-
pherson faced each other in the execu-
tion place to-day i knew that it was
impossible for the vile little half-caste
to employ men suitable for his purpose
who would follow his leadership even
among the desperadoes and pirates of
the yangtze kiang they would rec-
ognize his captaincy only so long as
they pleased it takes a man to rule
them--a man whom they fear even if
the- do not respect him such a man
jenkinson discovered in richard mac-
pherson then a young fellow of slender
means and an adventurous disposition
at loose ends in hongkong although i
do not know how the half-caste man-
aged to meet him and gain such a sin-
ister influence over him

  do not misunderstand me gentle-
men  i am positive that mr macpher-
son is morally as innocent of what he
did under that malign control as either
one of you americans he was out-
side of his normal self-bewitched en-
tranced hypnotized-call it what you
will but assuredly he was not richard
macpherson marquis of lochineal
whom we all know but mr winton
you guessed at chee nung and from
my own knowledge i can bear witness
that your guess was correct that it was
richard macpherson who led the pi-
rates who looted the avondale you
know how it happened the pirates
whom jenkinson had enlisted engaged
passage at hongkong in the steerage
of course but macpherson and his al-
leged servant jenkinson were first-
cabin passengers fortunately for me
i had assumed a humble disguise and

  was herded in with the steerage passen-
gers jenkinson had marked down a
bonze who happened to be traveling on
his own affairs in the first cabin as the
custodian of the seal and while he
was searching his body i escaped in the
confusion dropping overboard and
swimming ashore with the sacred relic
hanging from a chain about my neck

  and so the second attempt ended in
failure but while jenkinson had
missed the great prize at which he
aimed his followers had garnered a
rich loot and when a few days later
he again called upon them they re-
sponded eagerly there had been no
arrests for i was the only one of the
innocent passengers or crew who es-
caped and for obvious reasons i re-
mained in hiding it took many days
for me to reach canton and in the
meantime jenkinson had returned to
hongkong and received fresh instruc-
tions then under macphersons mad
leadership followed that furious attack
upon the shen fun caravan with which
i was traveling-an attack which de-
spite the disparity of numbers would
have been successful except for the ac-
cidental arrival of the viceroys guard

  there was however no further in-
terference with my journey and three
weeks later i entered shen fun and at
last felt secure from molestation for
even tsi-ann would never dare to at-
tempt to seize the sacred talisman from
its shrine-a sacrilege which would in-
evitably raise every hand in china
against her but gentlemen what even
the all-powerful dowager would not
dare to think of this miserable half-
caste and his dupe richard macpher-
son planned and accomplished

  accompanied by a half dozen of
their most desperate followers they en-
tered shen fun disguised as pilgrims
to the holy shrines they arrived a
day earlier than i did and spied out the
lay of the land and then when lulled
to a sense of false security i slept the
sleep of exhaustion after my terrible
experiences they entered the sacred
precincts during the watches of the
night and stole from its shrine the most
sacred relic in this great empire
the seal of confucius



chapter x

  macpherson had so far listened in
silence to the story which was such a
terrible arraignment of his past but
with that last dramatic impeachment the
limit of his patience was reached and
he advanced threateningly both win-
ton and sternberg had been watchful
for such a move and they were quick
to intercept him

  this is no time for protest nor ex-
culpation macpherson said winton
sternly it is an unpleasant business
but we must sift it thoroughly if this
man tells a single lie you will have my
full permission to do what you please
with him but it is absolutely essential
that we know what we shall have to
face go on wong tom for just
an instant macphersons resentment
threatened revolt against wintons as-
sumption of authority but dick too
came forward and laid a protesting
hand upon bis arm scowling and
flushed of face he stepped back and
wong tom picked up the broken thread
of his narrative

  there can be little more that you
have not already guessed he con-
tinued there was  concealing the
fact that vandals had entered the sa-
cred precincts for the seal was not the
only thing missing i do not believe
that the two leaders had given a thought
to anything else but their followers
were greedy for plunder and they
forced the most valuable of the treas-
ure chests and loaded themselves with
its contents that robbery when we
raised the alarm was the only an-
nouncement which we made public for
the far greater loss was known only to
myself and a dozen of the bonzes whom
i knew that i could trust implicitly

 the alarm was given within six
hours after the robbery was commit-
ted and from my previous experience
i was able to make a shrewd guess at
the identity of the robbers and to fur-
nish a description of the leaders with-
in the week every one of the vandals
but macpherson had been run down
and brought back to shen fun the
rising at lang tun was one of those

peculiar coincidences which could not
have been anticipated and the results
for a time threw us off the track of the
only fugitive who remained at liberty

  gentlemen you have seen enough
of shen fun and its people to-day to
be able to judge how the native vandals
were dealt with i have no apologies
to offer for my own part in delivering
them to the tender mercies of the citi-
zens of the secular city they had en-
tered into the game with their eyes
open fully realizing the penalties which
they would incur if they lost-and they
paid them in full in cold blood they
had murdered the two bonzes who
watched the holy shrine and that crime
alone merited the most severe punish-
ments decreed by the chinese law jen-
kinsons life was spared not from pity
nor because he was less deserving of
the death which the others suffered but
because i firmly believed that in some
way sooner or later he would be of
use to us in recovering the holy relic

  after he was brought to shen fun
he told us all he knew-there was no
resisting the measures which were
adopted to make him speak the details
of which i will leave to your imagina-
tion the plan of escape had been care-
fully mapped out in advance they had
separated after leaving the city and it
was agreed that macpherson should go
to lang tun to claim his wife and
meet jenkinson later at a point about
halfway between shen fun and the
coast it was jenkinson who had taken
the sacred relic and carried it from the
city but perhaps because of the chi-
nese blood which he had inherited from
his mother its possession terrified him
and although an infant might have held
it in its palm it seemed a weight which
he could not carry just before they
separated he deliveredit to macpher-
son and with macpherson it went to
lang tun

  mr winton it was macphersons
wife lady lochineal who was brought
-a prisoner-to shen fun after the
attack on the mission when i de-
manded her from the hands of her cap-
tors i was ignorant of her identity but
i knew that such outbreaks were futile


the popular magazine

and bound to be followed by terrible
reprisals i shall be perfectly frank
with you i rescued her because i
feared that if she were left in the hands
of the mob tsi-ann might use that as
a pretext and permit the foreign sol-
diers to sack the sanctuary fanati-
cism had run mad in the city and after
i had rescued her i knew that there
was but one safe refuge for her so
she was taken to the sacred precincts
there i questioned her and when i
learned that she was macphersons wife
and soon to bear him a child i realized
that i had secured a valuable hostage
if by any chance he had escaped death
in the attack on the mission i left her
in safe hands when i hurried to lang
tun promising that i would do every-
thing in my power to find her husband
and the friend who had come to lang
tun to serve her he paused and
looked inquiringly from macpherson to
winton

  go on said the american curtly
i have reason to remember your com-
ing to lang tun what then

  then after my gruesome task was
finished i returned disconsolate to shen
fun continued the chinaman the
ruins of the settlement and mission had
been minutely searched for the missing
treasure unsuccessfully of course
when the rumors of macphersons cu-
rious escape reached us every one of
his footsteps from lang tun to the
great tibetan desert where he disap-
peared was traced and followed the
individual was lost but so long as we
had no positive proof of his death we
continued the tireless search for him
and you already know how we succeed-
ed in the end

  a son had been born to him in shen
fun and you have been told of the
manner in which he was sent to his
father in negotiating with the mar-
quis of lochineal we necessarily ob-
served the greatest caution we dared
not admit that a foreign woman was
held a prisoner in china and i could
not let the legation staff know the truth
of our loss i believed that macpher-
son would quickly guess the whole truth
and offer to return the relic which was

absolutely valueless to him as the price
of his wifes freedom and that propo-
sition i should have received in per-
son

  after months of study the truth
slowly dawned upon me for a streak
of mystery strange to find in the occi-
dent was in his heredity i was con-
vinced that he was honest in his de-
nials  he was absolutely ignorant of
what he had done he had acted as
an automaton controlled by the will of
another i found means to watch and
study him sleeping and waking i even
attempted to exercise certain powers
which i have acquired i learned this
much-that the sacred relic was no
longer in his immediate possession he
had carried it from shen fun to the
settlement of lang tun all the way
unconscious of his movements but
from the moment of his awakening in
the club all memory of it wras gone
when he returned to his normal self
it meant nothing to him and he may
have tossed it aside as a valueless thing

  when i became convinced of that
i realizedthat the only hope of regain-
ing the holy relic through his assist-
ance lay in bringing him back to the
scene of his subconscious crimes if
we may call them so briefly my plan
was this-to bring macpherson to the
sanctuary which he and his compan-
ions had desecrated to the place where
the surroundings would fairly cry out
for recognition from that long-dormant
subconsciousness i trusted that in the
original environment i could induce
just such a trance as had controlled him
fifteen years ago and that step by
step he would repeat the progress of
his flight under our watchful eyes and
lead us to the spot where he had parted
from the sacred relic

  for fifteen years i have lived under
a cloud of apprehension the secret
of our loss has been carefully guarded 
the sacred shrine is as reverently at-
tended as it has been every day for
centuries and only to its actual guard-
ians is it known that the reverence is
a hollow mockery i know that tsi-
ann has been suspicious that all was
not right for on no other supposition
the seal of confucius



could she account for my forbearance
in delaying the exaction of vengeance
she may even have guessed the truth
but for fifteen years i have prevented
her from making that guess a certainty
and now on the very eve of my suc-
cess some one within our ranks has
betrayed us in no other way could
she have gained such positive assurance
that she would dare to send her troops
here with the demand for my head i
suspect cen yung a bonze who has
long plotted against me but it is not
yet too late to checkmate-

  a harsh mirthless chuckle indescrib-
ably horrible interrupted him and
when they turned to where the half-
caste crouched on the pavement they
saw his great shoulders shaking and
the scarred face distorted in a hideous
grin inarticulate sounds came from
the dry cracked lips but winton
quickly suspicious of the truth bent
over him and listened attentively to
his mumbling in the gathering dusk
the others watched curiously and when
winton straightened up they pressed
eagerly about him but disregarding
the questioning of macpherson and
sternberg he placed himself between
wong tom and the half-caste drawing
a revolver from beneath his tunic be-
fore he spoke

  wong tom there need be no fur-
ther mystery concerning the source of
tsi-anns information he said grave-
ly we have a saying which you
would have done well to remember fif-
teen years ago-that dead men tell no
tales tearing out this poor wretchs
tongue was ineffectual in insuring his
silence for in a few years he learned
to express himself without it he con-
cealed that faculty biding patiently his
time until a chance should come to em-
ploy it to his own advantage three
months since his opportunity came for
the agent of the dowager who had en-
listed his services in hongkong visited
shen fun as a pilgrim and beside the
path of the million beatitudes the beg-
gar in the kang told him your secret
within a month it was repeated to tsi-

ann in the forbidden city and-

stand back

a

  wintons pistol was pointed steadily
in his face and even in his rage and
desperation wong tom read certain
death in the eyes which looked over it
and halted mumbling curses with trem-
ulous lips as the pistol slipped from
his relaxed fingers and fell to the pave-
ment

  we may as wtell understand each
other right now wong tom said
winton you and jenkinson can set-
tle your private differences later we
have scrupulously performed our part
of the contract but it is evident that
you are unable to carry out yours
your struggle with tsi-ann is of no
interest to us and you can no longer
use us as your tools in your intrigue
our sole object is to rescue lady loch-
ineal from her long captivity and es-
cape with her to one of the foreign
settlements and we can no longer recog-
nize as a leader a man who has an en-
tirely different ax to grind i think that
you fellows will agree with me in that
he turned as he finished speaking but
instead of the ready assent which he
expected sternberg laid a warning
hand upon his arm

  by heaven uncle charley look
there  he whispered winton wheeled
about to find macpherson leaning over
the crouching half-caste whose eyes
were fixed steadily on his but it was
not the macpherson he had ever known
there was none of that curious bewil-
derment which he had seen so often
and the grim mask of imperturbability
acquired by fifteen years of stern ef-
fort to conceal suffering wras gone but
every evil passion which man can in-
herit or acquire stood revealed in that
curiously transformed face and win-
ton involuntarily recoiled from him as
he would have shrunk away from con-
tact with a leper it was only for a
moment however for in spite of the
instinctive repulsion he knew that he
was unjust-that macpherson was as
helpless as an infant and that even as
he had done fifteen years before this
outcast of the hongkong slums was
exercising some diabolical power which
they could not understand to make the
other for the time his abject slave


the popular magazine

  with a cry of protest he sprang for-
ward determined to break that horrible
spell even if he had to kill the loath-
some creature who was casting it but
dicks strong young arms suddenly
clasped him and held him back

  wait mr wrinton he gasped his
face ghastly white and his eyes di-
lated with horror it is terrible-
worse for me than for you-but we
must not interfere hosts of devils
are loose in china to-night and one
more or less cant matter no sanity
can save us our only chance is to lead
the madness of this mad city even
now the chinese soldiers may be enter-
ing the sacred precincts and it is only
by a desperate effort that we can hope
to rescue my mother

  winton raised his hands and gently
unloosed the arms which clasped him
you are right dick he admitted
thats an old head on your young
shoulders macpherson had apparent-
ly been oblivious to the argument which
had been carried on within a yard of
him and at a sign from jenkinson he
straightened up and disregarding his
companions circled about the court-
yard as if seeking a means of escape
from it examining carefully each of
the closed doors and then stopping to
listen intently at the one through which
they had entered from the lane win-
ton in response to a gesture from the
half-caste again bent his head to listen
to his mumbling exercising no small
measure of self-restraint in conquering
his loathing and disgust

  he bears you out dick he said as
he straightened up he claims that he
is now using for good the strange
power which he once employed for evil
-that only through the leadership of
the madness which he has induced in
your father can we hope to succeed
sternberg are you willing to follow 

  the consul nodded you couldnt
hold me back-even if there were any
choice he answered as he carefully
reloaded the chamber of his revolver
i cant see that the situation is bristling
with opportunities to get out of this
mess and that looks like the one best
bet to me

  winton smiled grimly as he turned
to the chinaman and now wong
tom what in the deuce are we to do
with you he asked will you pledge
neutrality if we turn you loose wong
tom smiled as he pointed to macpher-
son whose fingers were already clutch-
ing the great bolts which fastened the
door and winton made no protest
when he reached down and recovered
the pistol which had fallen from his
hand a few minutes before

  i will give you a more solemn
pledge than that mr winton he an-
swered dick is right when he says
that devils are loose in shen fun to-
night  but here in this courtyard the
gods have been fighting for me out
of evil has come good and jenkinson
has already accomplished as much as i
could have hoped to do with macpher-
son i hope to profit by it but if you
will permit me to come with you i
pledge you my word that i will not at-
tempt to use his madness for my own
purposes until you have no further need
of it

  which may be interpreted as mean-
ing until we are either safe or dead
said winton and wrong tom nodded
assent for a moment they looked
steadily in each others eyes and then
the american held out his hand

  ill trust you wong tom he said
quietly i owe you fifteen years of
life

chapter xi

  shen fun was as medieval in its
architecture as in its manners and cus-
toms and save for the broad path of
the million beatitudes there was not
one of its tortuous twisting streets
which was wide enough to permit of
the passage of a cart even at midday
those narrow canons between the high
buildings admitted sunlight only in oc-
casional patches  and at night they were
shrouded in cimmerian darkness

  those of its inhabitants whose busi-
ness or pleasure called them out of
doors after nightfall provided their own
illumination with lanterns of gaudily
painted silk or oiled paper carried at
the ends of long poles that the path
the seal of confucius



might be lighted while the bearer re-
mained in the shadow-a precaution
which was obviously wise in a place
which afforded so many convenient
lurking spots from which the predatory
might spring

  in the lane of the godowns there was
little traffic and less of human guard-
ianship at night for the chinese depend
upon the massive solidity of their win-
dowless buildings and the strength of
bolts and bars for the protection of
their goods and chattels before dark-
ness fell every foot of its surface had
been gone over in the search for trace
of the fugitives but concluding that
they had escaped through one of the
intersecting alleyways and found ref-
uge in another part of the city the
pursuit had passed on and left it de-
serted

  therefore the exit of that strangely
assorted and more strangely led group
from the go down which had afforded
temporary security wras made without
discovery of plan beyond the pur-
pose to win their way to the sacred
precincts there was none but mad and
desperate as such a confidence might
have seemed if considered in cold blood
and amid sane surroundings they
trusted implicitly and confidingly in the
trance-controlled leadership of mac-
pherson to guide them there and as
for macphersons part he seemed to
assume as a matter of course that they
would follow without question or in-
structions and he never so much as
glanced back after carefully withdraw-
ing the massive bolts and opening the
heavy door

  then through that complicated maze
which would have puzzled an indian
pathfinder in broad daylight he led them
unerringly in such impenetrable dark-
ness that his followers were forced to
rely upon the sense of touch to keep
together never for an instant in all
of the thousand and one twists and
turns losing the sense of direction upon
which alone he could depend

  macpherson had more than justified
their confidence in him as a leader and
it was not until he halted and they all
crouched together in an angle of lane

from which they could distinguish
against the sky the top of the ancient
wall which surrounded the sacred pre-
cincts that there was even a suggestion
of a conference

  greatly to their relief there was no
hint of disorder beyond that barrier
the silence of night brooded over the
great inclosure but the glimmer of biv-
ouac fires before the two gates which
were within range of their vision told
them that the imperial guard had es-
tablished an effective blockade at the
entrances

  macpherson however had halted
only to reconnoiter and he gave no
heed to the whispered consultation at
his back as he peered cautiously from
their hiding place watching and count-
ing the figures which crouched about
the bivouac fires in a shrewd effort to
estimate the relative strength of the
two guard posts a few minutes of
watching convinced him that his esti-
mate was correct and for the first time
since jenkinson had exercised his
strange power over him he spoke ad-
dressing wong tom in the cantonese
dialect in which he betrayed an un-
expected fluency

  if we clear the wray to the gate
can you gain immediate entrance he
demanded in a whisper so clear that
the question was audible to all of them
for a moment wong tom hesitated
and macpherson raised a threatening
hand as he repeated the question for-
tified with such an oath as only a
yangtze kiang pirate could have taught
him suggesting that he had ruled the
rascally crew which followed him on
his previous venture to the sacred pre-
cincts with a rough tongue and heavy
hand the chinaman involuntarily
shrank back but he quickly mumbled
an assurance that every door of the sa-
cred precincts would open immediately
to his summons

  you can count upon being a sub-
ject for ancestral worship in short or-
der if you are mistaken about this one
commented macpherson grimly
there is no use in wasting time in
trying to sneak in we could never
make it without raising the alarm


the popular magazine

when i give the word we will rush
that picket to the east the odds will
be with us for a few minutes-long
enough to dispose of the soldiers and
gain entrance if we do not have to force
the door it will take a little time for
the alarm to reach headquarters and
more for them to force entrance so
that we shall probably have a clear hour
inside to attend to our affairs

  it was the counsel of desperation but
no one among them made protest for
certain death lay behind them and their
only chance slender as it seemed was
to advance obviously macphersons
judgment was right the chinese sol-
diers would be keenly on the alert to
detect any furtive attempt at entrance
for the eunuch lat kee would realize
the difficulty which would attend car-
rying out his imperial mistress orders
if wong tom orrce gained the shelter
of the sacred precincts

  in the darkness the hands of win-
ton and sternberg met and clasped for
an instant but both remained silent as
they followed the crouching figure of
the half-caste who kept always close
on the heels of macpherson behind
them came dick with the chinaman
clinging to him for age had told on
wong tom in those terrible hours and
while his crafty mind remained as clear
and vigorous as ever his legs ached
from the unaccustomed exercise and
he was faint from lack of nourishment

  stealthily and silently they crept back
to the shelter of the streets for they
could not hope to escape the observa-
tion of the sentries in the open space
about the walls but as unerringly as
he had piloted them before macpher-
son led them through the maze until
once again they were within sight of
the sacred precincts and this time
exactly opposite one of the smaller
gates a mere postern in the ancient
wall before which the picket was sta-
tioned about a dozen soldiers gath-
ered about the fire and of these a half
dozen soon slouched off under the com-
mand of a corporal to relieve their fel-
lows on post still using the cantonese
dialect although he called them each
by name macpherson whispered his

final instructions while he waited to al-
low the relief to reach the farthest post

  wong tom your part is to get that
gate open and to see that it is kept
open until the last man of us is
through he said dick you will keep
with him and see that he carries out
that order as for the rest of us i
expect that we all know what to do
kill any man who blocks the way or at-
tempts to follow stick as close to me
as you can and remember that the man
who goes down stays there will be no
time to tend to the wounded or bury
the dead now forward

  so eagerly was that command obeyed
that it was a straight line which
emerged from the shadows and charged
across the space of perhaps three hun-
dred feet which separated them from
the bivouac fire save for the noise
of their feet on the pavement that
charge was made in grim silence for
in their desperate venture there was
none of the elan and enthusiasm which
through the centuries has contributed
so often to victory when only disaster
seemed possible

  with an alacrity which testified to
the painstaking instruction of their for-
eign teachers the soldiers who were
lounging about the fire sprang to arms
as that slender charging line emerged
from the shadows which had concealed
it

  in the uncertain light of the bivouac
fire the number of the attackers seemed
multiplied and jenkinson who had
been sufficiently terrifying in daylight
assumed grotesquely horrible propor-
tions as he advanced with great ape-
like springs which had carried him
ahead of his companions he had re-
fused to accept the revolver which
sternberg had offered him and still
clung to the great sword which he had
taken from the executioner

  one ragged and ineffective volley the
guard fired before the cowardice in-
herited from countless generations
overwhelmed the discipline acquired in
a few months and had wong toms
promise to gain immediate entrance
been fulfilled the winning of the goal
would have been a bloodless victory
the seal of confucius



for after that volley the soldiers broke
and ran leaving an unobstructed pas-
sage to the postern

  but that gate built with true tartar
solidity and massiveness remained
closed in spite of the summons which
he gave softly and then as it passed
unanswered repeated in strident tones
accompanied by a furious tattoo with
his fists against its strength they pos-
sessed no adequate means of attack
and the soldiers who recovered from
their panic when they realized how few
in number were the men from whom
they had fled halted in their flight and
then reenforced by the sentries and the
relief returned to attack them

  the crowded minutes which suc-
ceeded afforded ample demonstration
of why the pirates of the yangtze had
so faithfully followed macphersons
mad leadership for he apparently pos-
sessed that charmed life with which the
chinese so readily credit any man who
courts danger in combat-a charm
which they believe he extends to his
followers without so much as turn-
ing his head to see if his companions
were supporting him he threw himself
at the advancing soldiers and single-
handed checked those coming from the
east

  jenkinson snarling and screaming
like a maddened beast with even
greater ferocity attacked those march-
ing from the other side and for the mo-
ment changed the advance to a retreat
winton and sternberg took a less ac-
tive but perhaps as effective a part in
the fighting to hold off the advance
for while the range of their revolvers
was shorter than that of the soldiers
rifles they fired with an accuracy of
aim to which the chinese are strangers
and with their bullets utterly demoral-
ized the celestial marksmanship but
fight they never so desperately the
struggle was manifestly a hopeless one
for the alarm had become general and
reinforcements were hurrying from the
adjoining pickets while attracted by
the firing and the bugle calls the
searching parties were rapidly ap-
proaching from the neighboring quar-
ters of the secular city

  fortune had so far favored them that
as yet no one of them had received a
wound although about the gate in a
wide semicircle many dead or disabled
chinamen lay huddled but winton
knew that it could be only a matter of
minutes before they were overwhelmed
believing that dick because of his na-
tive costume and his thorough knowl-
edge of the city might stand a chance
of escaping he turned to urge him to
make the attempt while there was yet
time trusting that in the confusion he
might aid in the escape of the woman
they had come to rescue

  but wong tom stood alone before
the door for with the agility of a cat
the boy was clambering up the blank
surface of the wall and was already
within a yard of the top it was a feat
which any but a boy reared in a chi-
nese city would have found impossi-
ble but with dick and his childish com-
panions such climbing had been a daily
sport and fingers and prehensile toes
seemed instinctively to find crevices and
tiny projections which afforded suffi-
cient support for their lithe bodies

  it was no childish game that the boy
was playing now however for bullets
were flattening on the wall about him
and once well started on his climb there
was no returning while every foot he
gained added to the danger of a fall
and in spite of the great necessity for
haste he could advance only by inches
for every movement implied a nice re-
adjustment of balance and gradual
shifting of weight but slow as the
progress was he went steadily up and
at the very moment when the semicircle
of soldiers seemed on the point of clos-
ing in his right hand shot up and a
couple of finger tips hooked over the
edge of the cornice for a period which
seemed interminable his body swung
supported only by that precarious hole
as the left hand crept slowly up the
surface of the wall and then so quickly
that the eye could not follow it made
a desperate clutch which gave it a firm
purchase beside its fellow

  with one swing the boy raised him-
self to the top of the wall and a cry
of relief came from wong toms lips


the popular magazine

for he knew that on the inner side were
climbing vines and bamboo trellises
which would make the descent easy
but as if in bravado dick jumped to
his feet and ran nimbly along the top
of tho wall until he was directly above
the postern and then just as the in-
furiated soldiers fired a crashing vol-
ley he threw up his hands and plunged
headlong from the high wall into the
sacred precincts

  with that fall wintons last hope van-
ished for the soldiers had been largely
reenforced and stimulated by the cries
of the mob which had gathered behind
them they rushed forward with the
grim determination that never again
would he fall alive into the hands of
the chinese he turned to face them
jealously reserving for himself the pis-
tol in his left hand as he emptied the
chamber of the revolver in his right
into the closely packed ranks of the
advancing soldiers

  again the three foreigners were
shoulder to shoulder backed to within
a couple of yards of the postern against
which wong tom crouched mumbling
half-inarticulate supplications to the
gods he had so long served and who
seemed to have forgotten him in his
extremity

 death-or worse-was imminent
and as if to let them taste to the full
of its bitterness in anticipation the sol-
diers had halted about the victims
whom they considered securely theirs
and then just as sternberg with a
parting curse hurled his useless weap-
ons at those hideous grinning faces
and winton was about to secure for
himself the certainty of a quick and
painless death a cry of unutterable re-
lief came from wong tom and hardly
knowing how it happened they found
themselves in the sacred precincts
while a huge bonze slammed and bolted
the heavy door which had so longde-
fied them as the soldiers hurled them-
selves against it when he was assured
that it was securely fastened he turned
to the men who felt that they had been
literally snatched from the very jaws
of death and made low obeisance to
wong tom

  immediately about the doorway a
lantern cast a semicircle of light which
revealed that even the sacred precincts
had not escaped that violence which
seemed to be universal within the walls
of shen fun almost before the gate
the body of a man clad in priestly vest-
ments lay stretched face downward on
the path his outspread arms and legs
twitching convulsively a few feet far-
ther on was another body-also that of
a priest with the burned spots which
testified to recent sanctification upon
his shaven head at the very edge of
the illumination was dick struggling
with curiously bewildered movements
to free himself from a tangle of broken
shrubbery and sternberg ran to his as-
sistance as wong tom rapidly ques-
tioned the bonze who had so providen-
tially admitted them in a dialect which
even winton could not understand

  macpherson and the half-caste were
both so breathless and wearied by their
recent exertions that the former half
staggered to a lichen-covered bench of
stone while jenkinson still grasping
his bloodstained and badly nicked
weapon stretched himself on the path
at his feet his great calloused shoul-
ders working curiously as he panted

  it is what i feared answered
wrong tom when winton impatiently
interrupted the seemingly endless inter-
rogation of the bonze with a sharp de-
mand for information there has
been an attempt at treachery among my
own people a guardian stood at every
entrance ready to open immediately at
my summons but this unfortunate neo-
phyte paid for his attempt to be faith-
ful with his life he was about to
withdraw the bolts when cen yung in-
terfered and when he persisted killed
him with that sword cen yung stood
with his back against the door threat-
ening this other bonze with his
weapon when dick reached the top of
the wall the bonze was unarmed and
helpless to aid us against such opposi-
tion but dick dived from the top and
landed with such force on cen yung
that i believe he broke his neck and
he himself rebounded and landed in
that clump of shrubbery
the seal of confucius



  supported by sternberg dick stag-
gered forward to join them and al-
though his legs were still shaky he had
sufficiently recovered his senses to con-
firm the chinamans statement and to
disclaim greater injury than a shaking
up on the other side of the wall there
was still a great clamor of voices and
the sound of many marching feet but
the pounding on the door which had
followed their entrance ceased abruptly
as the high-pitched voices of officers
rose above the shouting of the excited
and demoralized soldiers

  that door wont stand five minutes
against a battering-ram exclaimed
macpherson hoarsely as he rose to his
feet and stepped over the prostrate
body of the half-caste he still spoke
in cantonese but a little of that old fa-
miliar expression of bewilderment had
softened the evil ferocity of his face
we had better be about whatever
there is for us to do he paused and
looked curiously from one face to an-
other as they stood revealed in the dim
light from the lantern and a hand
blackened with powder smoke swept
over his hardly less grimy forehead
what is it winton what in the
deuce are we all here for whats all
this row about  he continued brokenly
in english but before the american
could find words to answer wong tom
ran between them and grasping the
shoulders of the prostrate half-caste
hissed in his ear a few words which
had startling effect in restoring him to
activity the outstretched limbs gath-
ered beneath the bent muscular torso
and with one leap he was in front of
macpherson as nearly erect as the ef-
fects of the long-borne burden of the
kang would permit him to stand

  a peculiar droning sound came from
the cracked lips as he looked up at
the bewildered face above him his
beady eyes fixed intently on those which
turned to his with startling suddenness
and then as if by black magic the
bewilderment and confusion vanished
from macphersons mind and his face
was again eloquent of the evil pas-
sions which the half-castes strange
power had aroused within him

  of course to the sanctuary before
those devils can break in on us he
exclaimed in cantonese and as if tak-
ing it for granted that his command
would be unquestioningly obeyed he
darted away from the semicircle of
light the half-caste leaping after him
like a great frog as they disappeared in
the darkness wong tom too would
have followed but winton stretched
out a hand and grasping the neck of
his blouse hauled him roughly back

  none of that he said sternly
our business first wrong tom never
mind the sanctuary now you must
guide us to lady lochineal

  certainly i depended upon dick to
guide you there and thought that you
would join us at the shrine of the
seal protested the chinaman this
bonze wong an-ton knows all of our
secrets and is faithful he too will
go with you

  his fingers had fumbled nervously
with the gold buttons which secured the
loose blouse as he spoke and suddenly
with an agility which seemed marvel-
ous in one of his age and build he
wriggled loose and ran in the darkness
in the direction which macpherson had
taken leaving winton standing with
the empty blouse still clutched in his
hand

  the slippery devil exclaimed win-
ton savagely as he dropped the blouse
and reached for his pistol but dick
who had apparently fully recovered
from his bewilderment stepped for-
ward and caught his arm

  you could never overtake him and
minutes are precious he said earnest-
ly this place is a maze of paths and
courtyards wong an-ton is a safe
guide and every minute must seem an
eternity to the poor woman who is
waiting for us

  the youngster is right uncle char-
ley and we should be on our way
agreed sternberg as a particularly vi-
cious yelling burst out on the city side
of the wall and winton whose de-
sires so perfectly coincided with their
counsel turned to the bonze and
sharply ordered him to lead the way
to the house of the captive woman

chapter xii

  even with the guidance of wong an-
ton the progress through the intricacies
of the steered precincts in the darkness
was irritatingly slow the great wall
which divided the sacred from the sec-
ular city was nearly five miles in cir-
cumference and inclosed a curious
jumble of temples pagodas shrines
and buildings devoted to the domestic
jsurposes of the bonzes

  it was to a low rambling building
in an isolated quarter of the precincts
that the bonze finally brought them
after a journey which to their impa-
tience had seemed interminable like
all chinese dwellings the outer walls of
the house were windowless and access
to the interior was gained through a
large arched gateway which opened
into a square courtyard from which
the rooms derived light and air

  in that quiet and secluded quarter
there was no hint of the riot and turbu-
lence which raged without the sacred
precincts for long since they had left
behind the shrieking of the mob and
the shrill bugle calls which sent the
alarm circling about the walls it was
wong an-ton who gave the peculiar
signal which caused the wicket in the
arched entrance to fly open with a sud-
denness which told that the summons
had been anxiously awaited but it was
dick who entered first springing for-
ward to seize in his arms the dimly
outlined slender figure of a woman

  half laughing half crying she led
the way into one of the inner rooms
when dick released her and as she
turned to greet them winton could
hardly credit the evidence of his senses
for realizing how his own terrible ex-
perience at lang tun and the subse-
quent years of worry and anxiety had
aged him he had expected to find only
a pitiful wreck of the girl he had known
in the woman who had been fifteen
years a captive among aliens robbed
of the companionship of her child and
inexorably separated from everything
which had been dear to her in the
world

  but only the snowy whiteness of her

luxuriant hair suggested that she had
ever known care or anxiety for the
face which it framed was as youthful
and unlined as the one he had carried
so vividly in his memory since that
fateful parting at lang tun and it was
far more beautiful in its maturity than
the one he had learned to love during
the long voyage on the old china 

  flushed with excitement her smooth
skin was as delicately pink and white
as that of a baby and there was not
even the suggestion of a crows-foot
about the eyes which sparkled so joy-
ously  but the happy smile which dis-
closed beautifully white and even teeth
quickly vanished the flush faded from
her face and the sparkle of joy died
in her eyes as she looked expectantly
at the doorway and realized that vtith
the entrance of the bonze who fol-
lowed sternberg and winton into the
room the party was complete

  dicks native costume was stained
and torn and his face scratched from
his tumble into the shrubbery and the
clothing of the two americans immacu-
lately white when they had left the
house boat in the morning was filthy
with the mud of shen funs streets
and stained with great splotches of
ominously suggestive red their faces
were begrimed with sweat and dust
their hands blackened with powder
smoke and in the absence of the man
for whose coming she had so ardently
waited she could read only that he had
met with disaster in the strenuous fight-
ing in which their bloodstained and dis-
ordered apparel testified they had been
engaged for a moment she stood
speechless looking imploringly from
one to the other her face blanched her
lips quivering

  dick where is your father win-
ton where is my husband -she de-
manded brokenly after waiting vainly
for them to speak and while the boy
hastily explained that he was waiting
at the sanctuary for them wintons
eyes dropped before her steady gaze
of bewildered inquiry for he knew
that every word which dick so artless-
ly uttered was a lash to her pride and
confidence
the seal of confucius



  he-he left it to you to fetch me
-after all these years she faltered
when dick finished his explanation with
what he meant for the comforting as-
surance that his father had escaped un-
scathed from the fighting he is well
-uninjured-and almost within call of
my voice-after this cruel separation-
sends others when he might have come
himself winton i cant believe it
you are concealing something from me
-in mistaken kindness my son is de-
ceiving me or for fifteen years i have
deceived myself and lived in a fools
paradise tell me the truth winton
you know that i am not a cowrard he
is dead he is a prisoner he is so
grievously wounded that you have left
him while you came to take me to him 
macpherson would have come but
this is a grave business and we must
make haste slowly answered winton
he could not be entirely his own mas-
ter there was the general safety to be
considered and each of us had his part
assigned he has gone with jenkinson

and wong tom to- she cut him

short with an impatient gesture and
turned to sternberg

  will you tell me the truth she de-
manded passionately dick has told
me of you-you must be the american
consul at chee nung

  yes name of sternberg he an-
swered with a glance of urgent appeal
at winton in whose expression he
found little comfort uncle charley
lias given it to you straight lady loch-
ineal i can bear witness that your hus-
band has been one of the busiest men
in china to-day and his days work
isnt cleaned up-not by a long shot
yte never should have reached here if
it hadnt been for his leadership and i
reckon well never get out unless he
continues to boss the job

  lady lochineal smiled in spite of
her anxiety i am selfish and incon-
siderate she said contritely i have
not even thanked you gentlemen for
your kindness in coming to shen fun
to aid in rescuing me and in my selfish-
ess i have kept you starving while i
pestered you with foolish questions i
am ready to go with you but if my

husband could wait while he sent others
to fetch me he can surely wait long
enough for you to eat the supper which
has been ready against your coming for
many hours

  they were famished but consumed
with anxiety lest wrong tom might
yield to temptation and employ the
madness of macpherson for his own
purposes winton quickly negatived the
proposition for delay but dick whose
boyish appetite clamored even above
fear and anxiety quietly slipped into
the adjoining room and returned with
a generous supply of food which he
had looted from the laden table

  well not waste time if we eat as
we go and i couldnt go much farther
without eating he said grinning as
he displayed his plunder and soquick-
ly does hunger reduce a man to the in-
tellectual level of his primitive ances-
tors the two americans fairly tore to
pieces the plump capon which was part
of his loot when lady lochineal left
them to gather up the few necessities
which she would need the bones were
stripped bare when she returned with
a small bag made from antique bro-
cade hanging by a heavy cord of silk
from her arm

  i am ready gentlemen she said
quietly and then guided by wong an-
ton and accompanied by her son and
the two americans who had risked so
much to serve her she stepped out into
the night leaving forever that house
which for fifteen years had been her
prison all was quiet now and with-
out challenge or molestation they
reached the sanctuary that great pa-
goda of which the lofty dome heavily
covered writh gold leaf was visible for
many miles across the plain which lay
before shen fun beneath it was the
shrine which for centuries had con-
tained the most sacred and venerated
relic of china-the symbol of the great
secret power which the priesthood ex-
ercises in the celestial empire

  since the theft of the sacred relic a
dozen bonzes upon whose fidelity and
devotion wong tom knew he could
rely spent the night in the sanctuary
two of them always on watch before


the populacr magazine

the shrine while the others slept in an
adjoining anteroom within call the
personification of all that was conser-
vative and medieval in china wong
tom was nevertheless fully awake to
every development of modern progress
and without knowledge of those bonzes
of whose jealousy and enmity he was
suspicious he had smuggled into the
sanctuary a well-equipped arsenal of
the most modern weapons and during
the long silent watches of the nights
his followers had been instructed and
drilled in their use

  it was therefore a curiously incon-
gruous medley of the east and west
of reverence and sacrilege upon which
lady lochineal and her companions
entered after wong an-ton had guided
them through the puzzling maze of
outer courtyards and up the broad mar-
ble steps worn smooth by the feet of
the millions of pilgrims who during the
centuries had climbed them to pros-
trate themselves before the shrine of
the sacred relic the inner sanctuary
was a vast arched hall but so perfectly
proportioned that its size was the least
impressive thing about it great as are
the treasures of the forbidden city in
peking their value and historical and
artistic interest would have been
dwarfed by the contents of this single
room where for centuries the pick of
all the vast tribute of the devout of
the great empire had accumulated

  every inch of the vast walls was
covered with such decorations as only
the infinite patience of artists with the
true oriental indifference to the value
of time could have conceived

  but lavish of human effort and
wealth of materials as were the decora-
tions of the walls they paled to insig-
nificance before the jewel of which they
were the mere setting-the shrine of
the seal of confucius which stood at
the end in size it was as large as
many of the buildings which covered
the shrines scattered throughout the
grounds and even in the dim weird
light of the flickering candles which
burned about it it was a dazzling blaze
of glory none could guess the ma-
terial which gave it strength and sub-

stance for not a space the size of a
pins point was left uncovered with pre-
cious stones-diamonds whose facets
threw back the light of the candles in
dazzling reflections pigeon-blood rubies
which caught that fire and held it pris-
oner in their hearts clusters of great
emeralds which reflected it like sunlit
patches of a summer sea amid white-
capped billows of huge pearls

  standing before that gem-incrusted
shrine when they entered was macpher-
son the half-caste squatting on his
haunches at his back and wong tom
as tense and rigid as a dog at point
standing watching intently his every
movement ranged at either side were
a half dozen bonzes their priestly robes
in strange contrast to the cartridge belts
slung over their shoulders the deadly
modern rifles in their hands curiously
out of harmony with the ancient bar-
baric splendor which surrounded them
all were so intent upon the movements
of macpherson that the arrival of the
newcorrers seemed unnoticed and be-
wildered by the unexpected brilliancy
of the place they had entered they too
stood silent and spellbound

  cursing in cantonese macpherson
was tugging and prying at the small
doors in the shrine which concealed the
resting place of the relic-doors which
in all of history had never been opened
but once without the prescribed and im-
pressive ritual formerly they had been
secured with the simplest of catches
but following the robbery wong tom
had secured them so that they could
not be opened without destroying them
fearing that curiosity might lead to dis-
covery of the loss now in attempt-
ing to repeat the actions of his previous
robbery macpherson was meeting with
an unexpected resistance but wong
tom dared offer no assistance fearing
that the slightest interference might
lead to the violence of which he knew
he was capable in his trance and so
those men stood rigid and watched un-
til a cry from the one woman rang
through the sanctuary-a cry which
made them all start violently and
caused macpherson to wheel about un-
til his back was to the altar
the seal of confucius



  she had started forward with out-
stretched arms but one glance at that
threatening evil face distorted with
rage and black with passion and she
halted cowering back and covering her
own face with her hands- while piteous
little moans came from her blanched
lips macpherson betrayed not the
slightest sign of recognition in the un-
certain light he had seen only that
aureole of white hair with a dimly out-
lined face beneath it and in this woman
-dressed in native costume-there was
nothing to arouse the dormant memory
of the girl from whom he had parted
at lang tun

  macpherson now advanced on the
man who had been his confederate in
crime and for the first time since the
half-caste had found his courage and
attacked the executioner he showed
fear cowering until his great shoulders
almost touched the pavement and like
a great crab edging back under the lash
of that vitriolic tirade

  but although it was in a measure re-
volt against the mysterious power of
the half-caste it was in greater degree a
confession of how great that power had
been for macpherson gloried in recall-
ing what he had done of the capture
and loot of the avondale of the attack
upon the shen fun caravan of the des-
perate venture to shen fun itself he
boasted but those boasts were followed
by bitter recriminations and abuse

  i have faithfully served the blood
brotherhood which exists between us
he went on my hand has never held
back i have never shown fear nor com-
punction i have led those yellow fiends
when they would follow i have driven
them when they would have held back
i have stained my arms to the shoulders
in blood i have blackened my soul with
murder i have made my ears deaf to
appeals for mercy

  fte raised his hand threateningly over
the half-caste who groveled at his feet
mumbling inarticulately the bonzes
would have interfered but wong tom
hoping against hope waved them back
and slipping beneath that upraised arm
bent over jenkinson and again endeav-
ored to stimulate him to a renewed ef-

fort to regain the control which had
slipped from him

  lady lochineal had uncovered her
eyes and white of face and tremulous
of limb clung desperately to wintons
arm but after the effect of the first
shock had partly worn away she began
to get a conception of something akin
to the truth fortunately the cantonese
speech was as unintelligible to her as
greek would have been but in mac-
phersons ferocity and passion and the
attitude of the others toward him she
could construe only madness and
womanlike she let her heart prompt
and control her judgment and convince
her that it was anxiety for her safety
and the strain of his effort to save her
which had driven reason from its seat

  pity drove from her mind the last
shred of aversion and horror which the
terrible change in the man she loved
had inspired and with that pity came
the intense longing to save and protect
which has so often transformed the
meekest of women into veritable ama-
zons when those dear to them have be-
come helpless or threatened with dan-
ger

  motioning imperatively to her com-
panions to remain quiet she advanced
fearlessly toward the trio so dramati-
cally grouped before the glittering
shrine macpherson his face black
with passion still held his hand aloft
as if waiting for the opportunity to
make his blow surely effective the half-
caste still groveled at his feet his in-
articulate protest changing to a piteous
whine over him wong tom bent lower
and lower striking puny and ineffective
blows with his fists on the calloused
shoulders as he fairly shrieked suppli-
cations imprecations and commands
into the unheeding ears on either side
of them stood the bonzes as stolid and
rigid as if they had been carved from
wood their faces as impassive as masks
although every man of them realized
that the chief to whose cause they were
devoted was playing his last trump card
in the great game which would decide
their fortunes

  at the very edge of that group she
paused separated from the man whom


the vovulflcr magazine

she had come to save by the prostrate
form of the creature who had done so
much to damn him and the one who
was willing to insure that damnation if
through it he could find the relic on
which his own safety and power de-
pended slowly her small hands
stretched out above that hideous pros-
trate form and the half-maddened
chinaman whose fists were beating a
devils tattoo upon it startled mac-
pherson stepped back his eyes in which
shone the light of madness looking into
hers which were filled with infinite
longing compassion and love

  dick my dick you have come
for me at last she said tenderly and
even after that day of strong emotions
and sudden surprises the magical ef-
fect of her words and voice struck the
two americans dumb with amazement
as the sun banishes the clouds after an
april shower her appearance seemed to
clear all ferocity and evil from mac-
phersons face for just a moment
there was a suspicion of that bewilder-
ment which had always characterized
his recovery from his strange mental
wanderings but that too quickly dis-
appeared and despite the white hair
and grime of combat there shone from
it such a radiance as had greeted them
from the face of the woman he loved
when they entered the house which so
long had been her prison

  at the cry which came from his lips
wong tom drew back with a gesture
of defeat and despair for it was the
joyous cry of a man freed from
shackles and reprieved from cruel tor-
ment as he stood there transfigured
he seemed to winton the joyous reck-
less carefree macpherson of the old
days and so he must have seemed tc
the woman whose love and understand-
ing had cast out the black devils which
possessed him for from her lips came
the echo of his cry and her arms
opened to receive him

chapter xiii

  suddenly aged almost to decrepitude
wong tom tottered back and would
have fallen  if one of the bonzes had
not caught and supported him

  winton with old wounds reopened
and half-forgotten scars aching horri-
bly was fighting for mastery of him-
self and in no condition to master
others while macpherson and the
woman they had come to save still
clasped in each others arms were ob-
livious to everything but their new-
found happiness which had obliterated
for the time being the memory of the
cruel years of separation

  but the bonzes hatred in their hearts
for these foreign devils whose pres-
ence profaned the sanctuary were
whispering among themselves and
ominously fingering their rifles as they
watched the intruders with scowling
faces and resentful eyes

  a man of stone could not have re-
mained unaffected by emotion in what
they had passed through but stern-
berg had a more impersonal interest
in the whole situation than any of the
others and hard-headed and practical
he was the first to appreciate the dan-
gers which it presented macpherson
had been rescued from his baser self
wong tom was evidently past plotting
either for good or evil and the grovel-
ing whining half-caste was for the mo-
ment at least a negligible quantity but
they were immediately confronted by a
dozen armed men whose attitude was
becoming more and more threatening

  wong an-ton whose name denoted
that he was of the blood of the custo-
dian and who had very evidently been
a trusted lieutenant and the sharer of
his secrets had remained a silent and
impassive spectator and it was to him
that sternberg-for the first time as-
suming a leadership which the others
had held in turn-addressed his ques-
tioning in halting and labored chinese

  there is no time to lose mr stern-
berg answered the bonze quietly and
greatly to the consuls relief in per-
fect english we have had little com-
munication with the officers from pe-
king it was wong tom whom they
were after and they hoped to arrest
him before he could gain the shelter of
the sacred precincts but now they
know that foreigners are within and
that will offer an excuse for forcing the
the seal of confucius



gates which they will probably do at
daybreak you can imagine what the
result will be for there is a strong
party among the bonzes who are inimi-
cal to wong tom and to rid the sacred
precincts of the invaders they will not
hesitate to deliver him to the soldiers
and sacrifice you and your friends to
appease the fury of the city mob the
only possible safety lies in immediate
flight wong tom had expected that
you would all leave the sacred pre-
cincts to-night in any case and i had
perfected arrangements for you to
reach the house boat horses are wait-
ing at a small village a half mile from
the city walls and from there it will
not require more than three hours to
reach the house boat

  sternberg listened his face like stone

  there are difficulties went on
wong an-ton and there will be plenty
of opposition but it will not start un-
til we leave the sacred precincts wrong
tom cannot stay here nor can these
priests they would all be beheaded as
soon as they fell into the hands of the
soldiers we have plenty of arms and
ammunition and desperate as the
chance seems it is the only one we
must try to fight our way through i
will guide you mr sternberg i ask
only that you aid in preventing the cap-
ture of wong tom by placing him with
lady lochineal he is crushed by his
bitter disappointment and for a time
he will be as helpless as a child

  in a few words sternberg acquainted
winton with wong an-tons proposal
and winton gave immediate assent
the chinaman gave a curt order to the
bonzes and although the language was
unintelligible to the foreigners they
were satisfied with the effect for as
winton stepped forward and gently re-
called macpherson and his wife from
their blissful dream to a realization of
the difficulties which confronted them
one of them beckoned sternberg to fol-
low him to the adjoining room where
he displayed a bewildering collection of
weapons from which he might choose

  less than two hours of darkness re-
mained to them and within five min-
utes they had filed from the sanctuary

and under the guidance of wong an-
ton commenced another pilgrimage
through the intricacies of the sacred
precincts

  as stealthy as marauding cats they
approached the exit which their guide
had selected for their sortie and the
time was that which all experienced
campaigners recognize as the danger-
ous hour for while a night attack de-
pends upon the cloak of darkness for
creeping to close quarters and deliver-
ing the initial blow there must soon be
light or in the confusion friend cannot
be distinguished from foe

  the sudden appearance of armed
men from the exit which wong an-ton
had selected was enough to send the
soldiers on guard squealing and shriek-
ing in flight and had the bonzes  been
as cool-headed as the foreigners the
passage to the city wall might have been
made without striking a blow  but in
their nervousness they loosed their rifles
at the harmless fugitives the bullets
flying wide and doing no damage but
the report of the volley echoed through
the narrow streets as a tocsin to the
sleeping inhabitants

  the first hint of dawn was redden-
ing the east -as they reached the en-
trance to the nearest street of the secu-
lar city a street already filled with a
threatening assemblage of the riffraff
of shen fun but that mob quickly re-
alized that the men who confronted
them would not meekly submit to
butchery to afford a shen fun holi-
day

  a fairly creditable volley from the
bonzes opened the attack and while
of marksmanship they knew nothing
the range was so short and the mob
so tightly wedged between the build-
ings that its effect was terrible the
steel-jacketed bullets drilled through
rank after rank terror spread in a
great irresistible wave and with fal-
setto shrieks the crowd broke and
sought the shelter of the warrens from
which they had come leaving the filthy
pavement unobstructed save by the
dead

  but before they had advanced a hun-
dred yards their triumphant progress


the cpocpular magazine

degenerated into ignominous flight
not an enemy was visible but from
housetops and balconies unseen hands
showered down on them a perfect cas-
cade of missiles which there was no
dodging

  before they reached the city gate
which was their goal three bonzes had
fallen and lady lochineal was the
only one in the party who was not
bruised and bleeding

  in the desperate attack on the gate
one of the bonzes was killed and wong
an-ton received a bullet wound in the
arm but the gate was won and as the
advance guard of the imperial guard
came at the double into the open space
before the portal sternberg the last of
the fugitives stepped through the pos-
tern and forever left behind him the
mysteries and horrors of shen fun

  once without the city walls the pur-
suit was taken up by the guardsmen
but such tales of the prowess of the
foreign devils had circulated through
their ranks that they were not eager to
come to close quarters and contented
themselves with a long-range rifle fire
which inflicted no damage it was not
until they had almost reached the shel-
ter of the village where wong an-ton
assured them that the horses would be
in waiting that the main body of the
guard issued from the city gates with
lat kee borne in their midst in a chair
on the shoulders of sturdy coolies

  driven by their officers and fright-
ened by the eunuchs shrill reminders
of the consequences if wong tom
should escape the guard approached the
squalid village with a show of resolu-
tion encouraged by the quiet which
brooded over it into the belief that their
victory would be an easy one and
then when less than a hundred yards
separated them from the low mud-
walled houses they were met with a
crashing volley which placed a round
dozen of them beyond all fear of tsi-
anns vengeance the shots were fol-
lowed by such a cheer as never came
from oriental throats and a moment
later a score of white-uniformed men
under the leadership of a giant with
red hair sallied from the village

  the advance had halted at the first
shot and without waiting to count the
number of their adversaries the chi-
nese fled in such confusion that not un-
til they were halfway back to shen fun
could the commands of the mandarins
and the shrill protests of lat kee re-
store even a semblance of discipline

chapter xiv

  it was a sadly battered and bedrag-
gled crew which crept into the narrow
streets of the squalid chinese village
and even lady lochineals dainty na-
tive costume was much the worse from
that hurried flight through the filth of
the secular city

  thanks to the canopy of steel weap-
ons which her companions had held
above her head she had escaped injury
from the shower of missiles but all of
the men were bruised and sore and
their clothing was in tatters his face
drawn with pain wong an-ton sup-
ported by sternberg guided them to
the inn where they were to find the
horses for the last stage of their jour-
ney and rude as had been the shocks
which the consul had received during
the past twenty-four hours nothing had
surprised him more than the appear-
ance of the man whom they found
standing in the arched entrance to the
walled inn compound

  he was unmistakably british and to
any one with even a casual acquaint-
ance with the inns of court he was
just as unmistakably of the legal pro-
fession through a monocle which was
so firmly fixed that it seemed to have
taken root he watched the approach of
the two tatterdemalions and with a
carefully modulated bless my soul
he started forward when he recognized
that sternberg was a foreigner

  my dear sir i am looking for the
marquis of lochineal can you tell me
anything of him he asked for a
moment sternberg stared open-
mouthed and incredulous at the thin
freshly shaven face

  your name must be guilfoyle he
said finally and when the englishman
nodded he pointed a grimy thumb over
the seal of confucius



his shoulder hes all right-or as
nearfy all right as any of us-and hes
coming along with the rest of the
bunch he said and would have vol-
unteered further information had he
not been interrupted by a strange and
strident outburst of sound from the
compound forgetting wong an-ton
he jumped forward and attempted to
peer over guilfoyles shoulder

  by thunder i never expected to
enjoy the sound of bagpipes but if
that means that the highlanders are
with you its the sweetest music i ever
heard he exclaimed and before the
englishman could answer he was in the
compound and surrounded by a score
of brawny scots who fairly deafened
him with questions until the giant niel
enforced a measure of order with his
peculiar heavy-handed methods

  sternberg wasted no time in making
explanations and a half dozen wrords
were enough to send them streaming
from the compound with their rifles in
their hands while the fugitives feel-
ing secure that the unexpected succor
would afford them at least a respite
dragged themselves in to gain such shel-
ter as the primitive inn afforded

  with true british stolidity macpher-
son and his solicitor greeted each other
as casually as if they had met in picca-
dilly and guilfoyle briefly related the
reason for his being there and the man-
ner of his coming which he seemed
to consider a perfectly ordinary busi-
ness matter he had come from the
coast to chee nung in the second of
the yachts launches and finding that
the party had left for the interior three
days before he had proceeded to fol-
low on their trail

  he had brought the highlanders
with him more for their own protec-
tion than for his for they had gotten
out of hand and were in trouble with
the peasantry of the surrounding coun-
try

  and as they were all retainers of
the marquis of lochineal and in the
immediate service of the present incum-
bent of thetitle i feared that the es-
tate might be held liable for damages
for their behavior which in my judg-

ment was distinctly actionable he con-
cluded as to their present action i
believe that any competent tribunal
would hold that it was justifiable self-
defense and that therefore no dam-
ages would be imposed the appearance
of the defendants clearly demonstrating
that they had suffered sufficient tort at
the hands of the plaintiffs to excuse
even homicide

  of which there has been quite
some remarked sternberg who had
entered while he was speaking
enough to make it safe to make a
quick dash for liberty if there are
horses enough it took but a short
consultation to decide that immediate
departure was impossible however for
wong an-ton had provided only a half
dozen chinese ponies and their speed
would have to be regulated by the pace
of the footmen those who had come
from shen fun were too exhausted
from their exertions and lame from
their bruises to make the long march
in the sun until they had rested and
had their hurts attended to and dan-
gerous as delay might prove they were
forced to accept the risk

  lady lochineal accompanied by
dick accordingly proceeded to ransack
the larder of the inn and the haver-
sacks of the highlanders for food and
macpherson despite his fatigue eager-
ly questioned guilfoyle as to his mys-
terious mission to india the solicitor
answered evasively and looked signifi-
cantly at his companions

  never mind them they already
know the worst of me and nothing that
you can tell will shock them per-
sisted macpherson bitterly let us
have it guilfoyle i am still the head
of the house of macpherson and i give
you full leave to bare the family skele-
tons for their inspection

  very good-although this is entirely
irregular and contrary to precedent
said guilfoyle with apparent reluc-
tance after an irritating hesitation
you will understand that this admis-
sion is made confidentially and entirely
without prejudice but the most im-
portant result of the investigation
which i carried on was the discovery


the povulatr magazine

that there is a very serious doubt as
to your right to the titles which you
have borne for the past fifteen years
macpherson nodded indifferently
unless there is more behind it that
worries me very little he said god
knows that they have brought me little
happiness

  but there is much more behind it
my lord continued guilfoyle gravely
much that is without the province of
anything i have ever learned in the
study of law although some portions
recall vaguely stories of your ancestors
which are suggested in the dusty files
of our office

  go on  said macpherson curtly i
have no illusions about my family his-
tory which you can destroy

  guilfoyle cleared his throat my
lord i may sound heretical coming
from me but i will admit that aside
from the titles which they did nothing
to win and the estate which is so close-
ly entailed that it could not be squan-
dered there is little for which you owe
gratitude to your immediate ancestors
he said your father never bore the
title he was still a younger son when
he died for his elder brother the late
marquis survived him like yourself
he entered the army receiving a com-
mission in one of the native indian reg-
iments my lord there was never any
public scandal but your father was
summarily cashiered from the service
for a piece of madness which endan-
gered the lives of a whole european
community in india

  disguised as a native he gained en-
trance to the temple of juggernaut
being the first and last european who
has ever seen the interior of that place
of mystery he was discovered as he
came out and that discovery caused an
immediate fanatical outbreak which
threatened the lives of men women
and children in the neighboring english
settlement in the night they fled
through the jungle to the nearest can-
tonments and they succeeded in eluding
their pursuers only by scattering what
silver and other valuables they pos-
sessed along the trail avarice for the
moment proved stronger than fanati-

cism and as the natives delayed to
search for and wrangle over the treas-
ure they succeeded in reaching safety
by the narrowest of margins that
much of the story was familiar to me
before i visited india the sequel i have
known but a few weeks

  my lord the brahmans were not ap-
peased by the summary dismissal of
your father from the service they fol-
lowed him from the moment he doffed
his uniform and working in the mys-
terious ways of the east they gained a
weird control over him-such a subtle
influence as we scoff at in practical
matter-of-fact england because we can-
not reduce it to pounds shillings and
pence or square it with such standards
as we know but nevertheless it was
a fact in punishment for his sacri-
lege they laid a solemn curse upon him
-a curse which was to be transmitted
to his first-born child who in turn was
to possess unlimited power for evil over
children subsequently born to him

  now my lord comes a part which
can never be explained for your father
took no one into his confidence and he
is past answering there can be no
question of his own belief in the effi-
cacy of the curse which had been laid
upon him and it is my belief that what
he did was done to nullify its evil ef-
fects in so far as they might affect the
future in any case he took a most
unusual step for an englishman for
coming to hongkong after he was vir-
tually expelled from india he married
in due and legal form a canton slave
girl whom he purchased for a trifle

  less than a year afterward she died
in giving birth to a male child which
your father provided for under another
name and left in hongkong when he
returned to england it is my belief
that he did this thing with premedita-
tion  that he planned that never should
the curse which had been transmitted to
his half-caste child influence children
which he might have by a subsequent
marriage at that time he could not
have had the slightest idea that he or
his heirs might come in for the titles
and estates so far as i know he never
mentioned his marriage to the chinese
the seal of confucius



girl to a living soul and shortly after
his return to europe he married again
-a frenchwoman of noble family and
considerable fortune your mother

  his death fifteen years ago was the
first of that series of tragedies which
made his eldest sqn the heir to the titles
and great entailm estates which went
with them your elder brother was
killed by a fall from his horse and
when you reappeared after your long
disappearance there was no one to dis-
pute your right to the titles and in-
heritance

  it is needless to say that i- have
checked up every point of the evidence
my lord the story was volunteered by
a brahman priest in india never for
a moment have they lost track of your
father and his descendants they were
waiting for you when you arrived in
india and he gloried in telling me that
they were responsible for the charges
which were brought against you there
-charges of which you were absolutely
innocent but which you could not dis-
prove because they had drugged you
into insensibility and concocted care-
ful proof that you were guilty of the
theft from the temple-a theft which
was never committed

  they told me of your fathers mar-
riage in hongkong and on my way
here i stopped and verified the state-
ment the entries of the marriage and
the birth are in the records and cant be
disputed there is only one hope my
lord and that is that your half-caste
half brother may be dead that is a
fair assumption for all trace of him
has been lost for fifteen years he was
well but not favorably known in
hongkong under the name of jenkin-
son and one of the older police offi-
cers told me that-

  macpherson checked him with a ges-
ture and walked over to where the
half-caste lay stretched out on the dirt
floor and shook him roughly

  with a shriek of fear he awakened
and instinctively his hands reached out
for the kang but macpherson grasped
them and drew him as nearly upright
as his bowed back would permit him to
stand indescribably filthy reduced al-
a

most to idiocy by long years of perse-
cution and distorted by the crushing
burden from which he had so recently
been freed he was a horrible and repul-
sive object but macpherson betrayed
no aversion and supported him tender-
ly as he turned to guilfoyle with a cu-
rious smile on his lips

  we can testify that the sins of the
father are visited on the children he
said quietly it is only fair that he
who has suffered most should receive
also the lions share of such benefits as
may come with them there will be no
contest guilfoyle and i have the honor
to present to you the real marquis of
lochineal

  shocked and horrified the solicitor
would have made protest but at that
moment dick entered carrying a steam-
ing bowl and his mother was close on
his heels with its fellow macpherson
gave him a glance of warning and he
remained silent but he carefully avoid-
ed contact with the horrible creature
whom a trick of fate had made the head
of the great house which his fore-
fathers had served for centuries

  it was a curiously silent and listless
meal which followed for strange to
say there was something more depress-
ing to all of them in the developments
of the last half hour than in all the grim
tragedy in which they had played a
part

  macpherson whom the strange dis-
covery had robbed of titles and wealth
seemed less concerned than any of
them and made occasional efforts to
liven things up but it was a hopeless
task and it was a welcome relief when
one of the highlanders entered with
the announcement that a single china-
man had advanced waving a white flag
and requested speech of the leader of
the foreigners

  i reckon that i was it last said
sternberg after macpherson to whom
the highlander had instinctively ad-
dressed himself had disclaimed leader-
ship with a gesture we havent any-
thing to conceal bring him in here let
him do the walking

  it was lat kee who was led in a
few minutes later-a eunuch of great


the vovulatr magazine

stature and tremendous weight as be-
came a palace favorite whose whispered
advice often decided the fate of the
greatest men in the empire he was ar-
rogant of bearing and insolent of mien
when he entered but there was some-
thing in the grim faces of these foreign-
ers who looked at him with a mixture
of contempt and defiance which curbed
the impudent demand which he was
about to make and changed it to a
courteously worded proposition of com-
promise

  at that it was sufficiently cold-blood-
ed for he offered the foreigners safe
conduct to chee nung if they would
deliver wong tom and the surviving
bonzes over to him for execution
otherwise he pointed out they could
never hope to escape for the imperial
guardsmen would attack them as soon
as the left the village or if they at-
tempted to make a stand the village
would be demolished by the artillery
brought from the capital of the prov-
ince thirty miles away

  they listened in silence but there
was no need of consultation before an-
swering wong tom who sat shriv-
eled up in the corner gazed at the
man who was demanding his head with
lackluster eyes which betrayed nothing
of interest and beside him lady loch-
ineal was washing the bullet wound in
wong an-tons arm the half-caste
crouched on the dirt floor between the
eunuch and the foreigners who still
remained seated about the rude table
where they had eaten

  uncle charley you tell that fat
splay-footed toad that well see him in
-a hotter place than chee nung dur-
ing the monsoon first said sternberg
savagely after winton had translated
the demand which had been made in
mandarin chinese

  couched in more diplomatic lan-
guage wtinton translated the substance
but in their tone and expression the
eunuch had already read the answer
and his fat sallow face became black
with rage

  as a matter of fact his proposition
had been made in desperation for the
guardsmen were in open mutiny it

was probably fear of the foreign devils
rifles which had inspired it but a su-
perstitious terror had swtept over them
and the bannermen had plainly told him
that he could expect no further support
from their men in action against the
bonzes or their foreign allies

  tsi-anns orders had been positive
and he knew that she would never even
listen to an excuse for failure there
was just one desperate chance if wong
tom were dead the foreigners might
barter his head for a promise of secur-
ity and quick as a flash lat kee drew
a pistol from his sleeve and fired at
the man who sat mumbling in his cor-
ner his hands toying idly with the bro-
cade bag from which lady lochineal
had taken the simple dressing for wong
an-tons wound

  the treachery was so quick and un-
expected that the foreigners had no
chance to interfere before the shot was
fired and but for jenkinson the bullet
would have found its mark but from
the moment they had left the sanctuary
the half-caste had transferred his dog-
like devotion from macpherson to his
wife and understanding nothing of
what had passed he read in the
eunuchs treachery a threat of danger
to her

  even as the pistol was whipped from
the broad sleeve the great muscles of
his legs contracted and with terrific im-
petus propelled him forward an instant
before the trigger was pulled the
eunuch went down before the human
thunderbolt and lay stunned and help-
less on the dirt floor the half-caste
fell with him but so quickly had it all
happened that no one realized the truth
until the great muscles of his bowed
back relaxed as he rolled over for the
bullet meant for wong tom had
crashed through his brain

  before the eunuch recovered con-
sciousness he was securely bound and
every man in the room save wong tom
had gathered about to help while lady
lochineal perhaps dimly conscious that
the half-caste had believed he was dying
for her leaned over him and tenderly
closed the staring eyes the man who
had really been responsible for the trag-
the seal of confucius



edy was for the moment forgotten but
the deliberations of the men as to what
should be done with the treacherous
eunuch were interrupted by a sharp
exclamation from the corner which re-
minded them of him-an exclamation
which was quickly followed by such a
shrill shriek of triumph as no western
ears had ever heard

  still shriveled and tremulous but
with a face suddenly rejuvenated
wong tom had risen to his feet and
stood with one hand extended far above
his head

  for a moment the foreigners were
suspicious of further treachery the
bonzes suddenly drew apart uttering
shrill screams but almost instantly they
threw themselves flat at wong toms
feet kotowing until their foreheads
rested on the dirt floor still suspi-
cious and puzzled the foreigners
watched uncomprehendingly until lady
lochineal innocently and unwittingly
supplied the clew

  oh dick the poor old man is child-
ish  she exclaimed he has been
rummaging in my bag which contains
all of my little treasures you must get

that one back for me dick it is the
most precious of all-my lucky stone-
that little jade charm which you gave
to me on that last horrible night at lang
tun

  startled and incredulous they fol-
lowed the direction of her eyes which
were directed at wong toms upraised
hand between the thumb and fore-
finger he held a piece of jade no larger
than an old-fashioned fob seal but a
certain awe and reverence crept into
their minds for they realized that they
were looking at the most sacred relic
of the great teacher whose precepts
have been for centuries the accepted
law of uncounted millions of human
beings

  it was winton who broke the silence

  josephine i fear that you will have
to humor him and sacrifice your talis-
man he said gently call it your
ransom for wong tom will be our
friend and we have nothing more to
fear again he is the most powerful
man in china for again he is in fact
what he has been only in name for fif-
teen years-the custodian of the sacred
seal of confucius

george browns office boy

seorge brown writes the editorials and attends to the exchange work
of a big metropolitan daily newspaper all of which compels him to read
oceans of other papers it was his habit to send his office boy to the post office
every day to drag back a tremendous bundle of papers

    one day the boy who was red-headed and high-tempered received his
bundle in the corridor of the post office cut the strings and scattered the news-
papers in wild confusion all over the floor after that he ran wild among them
kicking them and slapping them about

    an official of the post office called up browns office with the purpose of
informing him that he had sent a crazy boy to the office and that the boy had
scattered the papers all over the building brown was not in when the call was
made but later the official of the post office informed him that when remonstrance
was made to the boy he exclaimed wildly

mr cuttens revolt

by peter b ky ne

author of the connemara blood  short-bred   etc

   which describes how a kindly cheerful optimistic and altogether lovable
gentleman was turned into a very thunderbolt of wrath a relentless instru-
ment of vengeance a mighty engine of denunciation and punishment and all
through a poor little joke conceived in the poor little brain of a neer-do-well
relative

excepting of course the aver-
age run of ills and minor trials
to which every human being
must inevitably fall heir it
would appear to those who knew him
intimately that mr james r cuttens
life had been singularly free from
worry and annoyance i suppose one
might comb the ten largest cities of the
world and fail to discover a more con-
tented man or a more efficient book-
keeper and cashier than james r cut-
ten in fact so gentle so kindly so
cheerful so optimistic so altogether
lovable was mr cutten that the little
tragedies of life which make of many
people neurasthenic wrecks passed mr
cutten by without even lighting to say
how dye do his remarkable dis-
position coupled with his sterling in-
tegrity had for him metamorphosed the
rocky road of life into an improved
up-to-date automobile highway bor-
dered with pansies

  having early in life discovered the
recipe for happiness mr cutten held
rigorously to his course he ate spar-
ingly avoiding alcoholic beverages and
starchy foods he retired early after
say two hours communion with a fa-
vorite author and immediately fell into
the dreamless untroubled slumber of a
babe at seven oclock he would arise
and hop into a cold bath emerging
from his bath glowing and tingling he

would devote fifteen minutes to calis-
thenics cook himself a light but excel-
lent breakfast and make a dash for the
eight-three arriving at his place of em-
ployment in the city at eight-forty-
seven

  blessed with health a good job and
a huge capacity of simple enjoyments
there is no need to marvel at mr cut-
tens happiness he had a wife too
still he was happy life for mr cut-
ten flowed along as gently as unruf-
fled as a purling brook through an al-
falfa meadow he was fifty years old
he made two hundred and fifty dollars
a month and he had saved his money
he had mrs cutten amply provided
for in the matter of life insurance and
he had a five-thousand-dollar endow-
ment policy about to mature the pre-
miums on his twenty-pay-life policies
were all paid forever he was a paid-
up risk and nothing now remained for
him to do except live to a ripe old age
and die can you beat that for happi-
ness 

  and as if that was not sufficient for
any man it was a matter of common
knowledge that mr cutten had a little
nest egg in the bank and owned his
own home-a pretty little bungalow
with a garage and an acre of land
around it in a beautiful suburban sub-
division how about that eh but
wait
mr cuttens revolt



  mr cutten had three peach trees and
three cherry trees and berry vines
around his boundary fence and in ad-
dition he raised white orpington chick-
ens and vegetables- his saturday aft-
ernoons his sunday mornings his long
summer evenings his holidays and his
two weeks vacation yearly mr cutten
spent in his yard and among his white
orpingtons his hens laid sufficient
eggs to pay for his groceries and he
had for dinner every sunday a chicken
with whose age he was familiar he
had fresh vegetables all the year round
and enough left over to give his imme-
diate neighbors something more than a
sample well i wonder if mr cutten
wasnt happy

  no sir mr cutten never worried
unless he was out seven cents in his
trial balance compared with mr cut-
ten a spring lamb was a tough cus-
tomer and no cloud had ever darkened
the horizon of his placid existence
until mrs cuttens big bum of a
brother-i hate to use that word too
but then mr cutten used it so i pre-
sume i am justified at any rate it ac-
curately describes mr marshall hack-
ford so even at the risk of appearing
vulgar we will let it stand-came to
visit the cuttens for two weeks and
stayed a year

  it was not so much the advent of mr
hackford into his relatives home or
the alarming inroads he made into mr
cuttens groceries that made of mr
cutten a raging demon terrible to be-
hold but rather hackfords low vulgar

sense of humor- but thats the

story and it would be unprofessional
and unprofitable to tip it off now let
us therefore to the prologue

  we have already vaguely surmised
one small fly in mr cuttens amber-
his wife in the beginning mr cut-
ten at thirty had married mrs cutten
who was twenty and the eldest of a
family of six girls and a boy those
were the good old days when a man
who earned a hundred dollars a month
was presumed metaphorically speaking
to have the world by the tail and in a
position to swing it wheresoever he
listed mr cutten was such a man

then-a prize not to be passed lightly
by

  having entered upon a commercial
career at the age of sixteen at the time
of his marriage mr cutten had three
thousand dollars in bank he was sup-
posed by the hackford family to have
more after furnishing a cottage
with plush-upholstered spindle-shanked
chairs and sofas a curlicued four-
decker whatnot a marble-topped cen-
ter table for the parlor et cetera he still
had two thousand dollars left to do with
as he pleased following the trend of
his generous nature he gave his wife a
little checking account of five hundred
dollars within sixty days she had
spent it on her unmarried sister and
her baby brother marshall and was
hinting for more

  a great many people make the mis-
take of assuming that an easy mark
is devoid of common sense that is a
mistake mr cutten while realizing
that he had married the hackford fam-
ily in a certain sense saw no reason
why he should stand and deliver more-
over he hoped for a family of his
own so pending the arrival of his
heirs he decided to get the remainder
of his savings down safe he quietly
purchased twenty acres of despised
suburban property with it filed the deed
away in a safe-deposit box and with
the exception of the first monday in
march of each year when the assessor
came around he forgot that he owned
the land having purchased his twenty
acres mr cutten very truthfully in-
formed his wife that he had no more
money but would make her an allow-
ance from his salary and pay all bills
himself

  it was a long time before mrs cut-
ten forgave him she felt she had been
swindled and for quite a while she
suspected mr cutten of living a double
life

  mr cuttens family had never ma-
terialized true he had fathered a son
who had died at the age of six hours
and there had never been any more
babies this fact saddened mr cut-
ten-but sorrow sprinkled on certain
natures merely serves to make them


the cpocpulacr magazine

more mellow and kindly and he could
never forget that his wife was the one
who suffered most it was well for him
that he did for mrs cutten was a little
inclined to nag indeed had she been
married to an ordinary man it is diffi-
cult to say just what limitations might
be placed on her nagging but mr
cutten always knew just the right thing
to say to divert an impending storm
and the right thing to do to keep her in
fairly good humor and as this knack of
saying and doing the right thing appar-
ently entailed no strain on his seeming-
ly inexhaustible fund of gentleness and
good humor he managed to get along
very well and could in all sincerity
brag that with him marriage had not
been a failure

  in the meantime mr cuttens twenty
acres had increased tremendously in
value it was no longer a suburban
tract he had figured on this and now
at fifty years of age the future held no
terrors for him he had worked for
the same firm all his life-it was the
only job he had ever held-and now
that the old partners were dead and
their sons in command the sight of an
expansive gentleman with an air of
large emprise who was drifting into the
office very frequently of late and in-
dulging in long consultations with mr
cuttens youthful employers actually
caused him to snicker furtively into his
ledgers he knew the trust was after
the firm and he didnt care

  mr cutten made up his mind to keep
right on posting debits and credits and
handling the cash until some young fel-
low should take his job at half the sal-
ary and the day this happened-the
day the new trust manager should lead
the new bookkeeper to his desk and in-
form mr cutten kindly that while they
hated to part with such an old and
valued employee still his services were
no longer required-at his present sal-
ary-mr cutten had fully made up his
mind what he was going to do

  he was going to laugh out joud he
had chuckled his way through life but
on that day he would laugh like a
laughing hyena for he could afford it
in all his life he had never been angry

and he would not even grow angry on
that fatal day instead he would en
the instant divest himself of his alpaca
office coat slam it into the wastebasket
and go home with joy in his heart to
devote the remainder of his days to sci-
entific gardening and chicken culture
he would set traps for gophers and
concoct deadly poisons for predatory
bugs and he would study astronomy
all his life he had longed for a huge
telescope such as one will frequently
see in the possession of a patriarchal
old gentleman in a city street on a clear
moonlight night the telescope bearing
a sign which says

  see the man in the moon for five cents

  mr cutten desired such an instru-
ment he planned to build a revolving
turret on the roof of his house mount
the telescope in it and on balmy mid-
summer nights study the heavenly
bodies

  the fact is mr cutten was really of
a scientific turn of mind which prob-
ably resulted in his phenomenal success
as a bookkeeper it was an inherited
tendency his uncle jared cutten was
a well-known amateur astronomer and
student of animal life in addition to
being a bachelor and the possessor of a
vast fortune he it was who for many
years had a standing offer of a reward
of fifty thousand dollars for the discov-
ery of a cure for cancer or tuberculosis
jared cutten was a patron of scientific
research although he could be induced
to back any proposition which had for
its object the attainment of exact and
definite knowledge of some obscure
problem of no particular importance to
the human race he was as croehety
and belligerent as his nephew james r
cutten was genial and peace-loving

  it was an open question among jared
cuttens nephews and nieces-with the
exception of mr cutten-as to who
should inherit the old gentlemans
money mr cutten was firmly of the
opinion that his uncles fortune would
be left to charity and the furthering of
scientific research in fact he didnt
care what became of it for he did not
require any of it for his personal use
mr cuttens revolt



of all the nephews and nieces mr cut-
ten was the only one who took no vital
interest in the state of uncle jareds
health he had not seen the old man
in years

  this was not unfriendliness on mr
cuttens part for jared had a mighty
brain and for this mr cutten admired
and respected him but his own decency
and self-respect would not permit the
veteran bookkeeper to join the horde
of relatives who thronged around the
old man hoping his health was good
and disappointed because it was never
bad however he had carefully perused
his uncles celebrated book on serpent
worship and an account of the expe-
dition which the old man had financed
to desolation island to observe the
transit of venus

  old jared was too busy studying rep-
tiles and animals-this was his princi-
pal hobby with astronomy a close sec-
ond-to call on his relatives and mr
cuttens nature was too fine to permit
of his appearing fond of the old man
for the sake of his money

  things were at this pass when mar-
shall hackford appeared upon the
scene mr hackford was twenty-eight
years old weighed a hundred and
eighty pounds and was the baby of the
family seven sisters and a mother
had effectually spoiled him he was
too proud to work preferring to let his
family do that for him and he had been
raised under the impression that he was
delicate up to the day his mother died
he had never peeled his own potatoes at
dinner he was a handsome miserable
spoiled selfish peevish overgrown
baby and for a man without any par-
ticular vices he was about the most
worthless scrub one could meet in a
years travel this was the incubus
which was foisted upon mr cutten
when he married into the hackford
family

  it began with hobbyhorses and ten-
cent pieces for candy and ran the
gamut of footballs baseballs and bats
a shetland pony a gold watch and a
college education at the persistent
and never-wearying-well solicitation
of mrs cutten who worshiped her brat

of a brother mr cutten had put up
fifty dollars a month for three years to
send marshall to college for the hack-
fords were as poor as the proverbial
church mouse

  mr cutten remarked upon the occa-
sion of his surrender that to him it ap-
peared a good deal like putting a gold
ring in a pigs nose and let it go at
that he found it easier to put up the
fifty than arouse the ire of mrs cut-
ten and the hackford family he was
visibly and financially relieved when
marshalls health and the patience of
the faculty failed coinddently

  one by one the hackford sisters had
married-sterner men than mr cutten
by the way-and one and all they de-
clined to harbor poor dear marshall
who with the death of his doting par-
ents found himself without a home
and not only obliged to peel his own po-
tatoes at dinner but to earn them also

  a most unlucky dog was marshall
as fast as mr cutten found him a job
marshall would discover that the boss
was prejudiced against him or the other
clerks were shunting their work on him
or the light was awful on his eyes or
in fact any number of things mar-
shall had a list of grievances and rea-
sons why his manhood compelled him to
tender his resignation compared to
which a recall petition loomed up in
the dimensions of a cigarette paper he
was a nuisance and finally mr cutten
having gotten himself disliked by many
of his business friends on marshalls ac-
count gave up the battle and marshall
came to live with him while waiting for
something decent to turn up

  every day for three months he had
gone up to the city with mr cutten
ostensibly looking for work but in
reality praying he wouldnt find it
finally he gave up in despair and re-
mained at home doing little chores
about the place such as going to the
butcher shop for his sister sweeping
down the front steps and the sidewalk
exercising the dog and bringing in wood
and kindling a large part of each day
however was spent in the dutchmans
pool parlor uptown where marshall
demonstrated to his admiring friends


the ppuur magazine

the ease with which fifteen balls could
be put down without a miss

  about this time mr cutten discov-
ered that whenever he hung his over-
coat up in the hall and left the change
from a half dollar in the little side
pocket somebody always nipped the
change however even then mr cut-
ten made no complaint finding it
cheaper to harbor marshall at home
than foot his expenses abroad once
or twice he did make a feeble protest
which was incontinently overruled for
marshall was still the baby of the hack-
ford family and on her deathbed mrs
hackford had commended marshall to
her eldest daughters care

  i have forgotten to state that at the
time mr cutten made his purchase of
the suburban twenty acres he had con-
sidered it the part of a shrewd husband
to keep this information to himself
for twenty years he had kept it and
blessed the forethought that had
prompted the idea

  about the time marshall had become
as common around the house as an old
rug the trust took over the concern
whose books mr cutten had kept for
thirty years and mr cutten while
somewhat nearsighted by this time
could nevertheless see the handwriting
on the wall he nerved himself for the
verdict and speculated upon the advis-
ability of practicing a horse laugh
against the day of his retirement he
felt that his cachination must do full
justice to his sense of contentment for
of late he had been the recipient of nu-
merous offers from real-estate dealers
for his twenty acres he had stead-
fastly declined them all holding out for
a hundred thousand net for he realized
that with bungalows and alleged swiss
chalets springing up like mushrooms all
around his twenty acres it would not
be long before somebody paid him his
price and he was not disappointed
for eventually he received such an offer

  the offer however came through the
most unexpected channel imaginable a
real-estate dealer saw the land realized
its possibilities as a subdivision and at
once sought out the owner instead of
visiting mr cutten at his place of em-

ployment in the city however he
elected to call at mr cuttens home
during the latters absence he met
mrs cutten and unfolded his proposi-
tion need we say more

  no except to remark in passing that
it was a terrible blow to mrs cutten
it would be a terrible blow to any mar-
ried lady to discover after twenty years
of married life that her husband has
been concealing a hundred thousand
dollars worth of assets

  such a sneaky thing to do cried
mrs cutten the miser working
away year in and year out when we
might be traveling in europe

  forthwith she flew into a rage and
called up mr cutten then she called
him down marshall coming in for his
luncheon about that time and finding
his sister in tears was soon in posses-
sion of the tale of mr cuttens duplic-
ity he said nothing but thought a
good deal later in the afternoon he
strolled uptown and casually inquired
of the dutchman how much he would
take for his pool parlor

  poor mr cutten hated to come home
that night when he did in the lan-
guage of the classic he got his and
against the torrent of the hackford
wrath his good nature could not prevail

  for a week mr cutten continued to
get his at home then on saturday aft-
ernoon at the office he got his some
more however he had been expecting
that so to his credit be it said that he
remembered to laugh he did more
he flashed a certified check for a hun-
dred thousand dollars on the amazed
trust manager and informed that indi-
vidual that he might for aught mr
cutten cared to the contrary invade
the realm of his satanic majesty in a
hand basket after which mr cutten
removed his alpaca office coat rolled it
into a compact little ball dashed it into
the wastebasket and left that office
forever stepping high like a ten-time
winner it was the first dash of spirit
he had ever showed and possibly a
great measure of it was totally unneces-
sary but then he had been heckled like
a caged bear for a week past and his
nerves were gone for the time being
mr cuttens revolt

 

  mr cutten went uptown and banked
his check then he strolled over on
automobile row and bought an elec-
tric for mrs cutten it was about the
only thing he could think of as a peace
offering next he purchased for him-
self that type of motor car described as
a racy roadster and engaged a greasy
mechanic to drive him home in style
while another mechanic-not quite so
greasy followed in the electric on
the way mr cutten paused long enough
to purchase his telescope

  thus did mr cutten return to na-
ture his white orpingtons and the sci-
entific life which had been calling to
him for thirty years

  his purchase of the electric was a
knock-out stroke of diplomacy mrs
cutten kissed him a dozen times and
cried with joy also she called him
jimmy all the evening and this was
something which hitherto had always
presaged a raid on his bank account
so closely did mr cuttens own joy
approximate delirium that he could not
find it in his gentle heart to reprove
marshall when that wart on the face
of society took the racy roadster out
for a spin around the block skidded
into the curb and demolished a wheel
on the contrary mr cutten instructed
the parasite to hold himself in readi-
ness for a journey to the city next day
for the purpose of laying in a stock of
summer raiment

  for a week all went merry as a mar-
riage bell in the cutten establishment
it almost appeared to mr cutten that
the money wasnt going to be a bone of
contention after all and he felt a little
ashamed of himself for his twenty-year
suspicion that a hackford should never
be trusted with more than thirty-five
cents at a time

  during that week mr cutten made
his first discovery of benefit to science
in the lower end of his garden he un-
earthed a colony of argentine ants the
first seen in that section of the state
they were a long way from home and
mr cutten recognized them as stran-
gers  hence he investigated and discov-
ered that the argentine ant is a distinct
menace to society

  now as those familiar with the
alarming spread and pestiferous activ-
ities of the argentine ant must realize
mr cuttens discovery of the invaders
into that peaceful suburban community
was really an important one ants in
the sugar bowl ants in the cake box
and in the molasses jug ants every-
where was the curse that threatened
the community mr cutten immedi-
ately published and distributed at his
own expense a pamphlet descriptive of
the argentine ant and his depredations
and advised housewives to place jars of
sugar diluted wtith water and arsenic
in their cellars the poisoned sugar
would then be carried by the ants to
their young and the queen ants and
thus by slow poisoning the coming
generation would become enfeebled and
the pest eventually eradicated

  for this public work mr cutten re-
ceived a half column in the local pa-
per this in turn was swiped as a
good story by one of the city papers
jared cutten read it and scratched his
head in a vain endeavor to recall what
his nephew looked like at any rate he
wrote mr cutten a nice letter com-
mending his public spirit and the sci-
entific zeal with which he had handled
the argentine ants

 however the ant campaign had
scarcely been started before mr cut-
ten received further evidence that the
hackford spirit was ramping abroad
with designs on his bank account mrs
cutten came to him one day with the
suggestion that really they ought to do
something for poor dear marshall mr
cutten gulped and inquired mildly
what she had to suggest

  ive just given the fellow a new
overcoat and a new suit to keep him
from wearing mine and ive just had a
bill for a set of new tires hes worn out
already scooting yound in my racy
roadster he said with just a hint of
complaint in his voice were feeding
him and boarding him free gratis and
have been for a year isnt that
enough 

  i think we might set marshall up
in business for himself began mrs
cutten playfully pinching mr cuttens


the popular magazine

ear a la napoleon bonaparte it was
a way she had when she wanted any-
thing and for twenty years it had never
failed to work

  wha-what kind of a business 
quavered mr cutten feeling himself
about to slide from his high private re-
solve to cut off mr hackford at the
pockets

  that pool parlor up on main street
schultz the man who owns it wants to
go back to germany and hell sell at a
sacrifice

  how much demanded mr cutten
weakly

  three thousand dollars jimmy
well its a sacrifice ill admit re-
torted her husband only im elected
instead of schultz theres a lot of
things id rather do with three thousand
dollars my love than let poor dear
marshall play horse with it

  but jimmy dear we wont miss
such a trifle why were rich

  my love said mr cutten when
youve handled money as long as ive
handled it youll realize that riches have
wings ive been creeping along close
to the earth for fifty years and by
george if theres going to be any flying
you and i will do it i havent a very
high opinion of marshalls business
ability although it would seem that a
pool parlor would be about his limit
ill have to think it over my love i
was never accused of throwing three
thousand dollars to the birds in a
hurry

  do look into the matter jimmy
dear purred the companion of mr
cuttens ioys and left him to think it
oyer for in all their married life mr
cutten had never before temporized
while being raided and with the keen
intuition of her sex mrs cutten de-
cided that haste might ruin marshalls
chances she was content for the
nonce with a half victory

  mr cutten really perturbed for the
first time in his life went down into the
cellar to think it over parting with
money in driblets never hurts a gener-
ous nature but it is the three-thousand-
dollar gobs that break ones heart
and mr cutten had a keen suspicion

that he was being worked he was still
thinking it over when it occurred to him
that it wras time to gather the eggs feed
his hens and lock them in for the night

  now for some days past mr cutten
had been vaguely troubled one of his
white orpingtons had suddenly ceased
laying although apparently trying hard
enough to make good and as there was
no obvious reason why she should not
succeed the scientific side of mr cut-
tens nature was all on edge to ferret
out the mystery now as he entered
the yard of his hennery he thought he
had solved the problem and paused by
the gate to prove his conclusions

  an unusually large gopher snake was
crawling through the wire-netting
fence mr cutten trembling for the
fate of his prize chicks saw the in-
truder wind his sinuous way across the
yard and slip noiselessly up the run-
way into the hen house ijaen mr tut-
ten followed and watched his snakeship
through a knot hole he saw the reptile
creep up to a low box in which a white
orpington was even then in the act of
endeavoring to deposit her daily treas-
ure-the same hen in fact which had
so mysteriously ceased laying the hen
saw the gopher snake approaching
squawked in terror and flew for her
life the snake nothing daunted
climbed into the box and disappeared
mr cutten approaching cautiously
peered into the box and to his amaze-
ment discovered that the vandal had
wrapped his maxillaries around the
small end of the egg and was actually
engaged in the task of swallowing it
whole

  well ill be blowed gasped mr
cutten an egg-eating sucker of a
gopher snake why i never heard of
such a thing and forbearing to disturb
the reptile at its meal he ran to the
house to call mrs cutten and marshall
to observe the remarkable perform-
ance on the way out he carefully
closed the chicken-house door to pre-
vent the escape of the snake

  but mrs cutten and marshall were
out in the racy roadster so pinning a
note on the dining-room table instruct-
ing them to report at the hennery to
aftr cuttens revolt



view a strange sight mr cutten re-
turned to enjoy to the fullest the sci-
entific delight of watching a gopher
snake dispose of a hens egg without
even cracking the shell by the time
mrs cutten and marshall had arrived
the egg had almost passed the snakes
lips and the creatures head resembled
the thumb of a boxing glove

  mrs cutten fled in affright refusing
to look at the horrid creature but mar-
shall possessed of all the curiosity of
lazy and worthless people took keen
enjoyment in sharing with mr cutten
his study of the egg-swallowing snake
together the watched for an hour
while the egg slowly worked along the
snakes alimentary canal its progress
could be readily traced by the conspicu-
ous lump which it produced in the
snakes midriff thus proving the egg to
be still intact

  how long jimmy-since mr cut-
tens retirement on the proceeds of his
early sagacity marshall had adopted
his sisters patronizing habit of calling
mr cutten jimmy-do you suppose
it will take the gastric juices of that
snakes interior to so work upon the
shell of the egg that it will soften and
permit the egg to digest 

  it was a big question it opened up
a line of scientific research and like a
falling star it dropped on james r cut-
tens inherited appetite for exact and
definite knowledge bearing on subjects
of no importance to the human race

  how long zvould it take the snake to
digest the egg

  mr cutten scratched his head and
tipped his hat over on his left ear in a
manner suggestive of profound medita-
tion marshalls query had opened up
an interesting line of conjecture so not
desiring to appear ignorant in the pres-
ence of his despised brother-in-law
mr cutten spat nonchalantly and de-
clared with conviction that within four
hours the lump in the snakes belly
would subside thus demonstrating the
powerful action of the gastric juice as
an aid to digestion

  marshall hackford shook his head
it cant be done he said with equal
conviction

  why cant it mr cutten demand-
ed nature always provides a way
if nature had intended that a snake
should not swallow an egg without the
ability to assimilate it the snake would
leave the egg alone it stands to reason
but that dog-gone snake has been guz-
zling an egg a day for ten days and i
know it-

  it will take at least twenty-four
hours if not longer said mr hack-
ford

  nonsense marshall you talk like
a child if it takes a gopher snake
twenty-four hours to digest a white
orpington egg it stands to reason he
wouldnt be hungry every day-and this
fellow gets an egg a day i tell you
and he sucks em down whole for i
havent found any eggshells lying
around-

  bet you the cigars he dont get away
with that egg in less than forty-eight

hours if vou think vou know so much

    

about a snake mr hackford was
fond of- games of chance on a small
scale

  mr cutten reflected that if he won
he would be winning his own cigars
and if he lost he would be no worse off
than he was before so he was not in-
terested in making a small bet

  that old uncle jared of yours could
settle this question in jig time pursued
marshall take a man whos studied
snakes all his life and written a book
on snake worship and theres darned
little he dont know about a snake

  ill wire him said mr cutten im-
pulsively slapping his leg ill wire
him and find out marshall you watch
the snake while i run down to the tele-
graph office and quite aglow with in-
terest mr cutten sprang into the racy
roadster and scorched downtown where
he sent the following telegram to his
uncle jared

  have snake just finished swallowing egg
from white orpington hen egg is life size
and intact to decide bet please wire collect
approximate period required for complete
digestion

  jared cutten had just penned the last
sentence in a paper to be read before
the anthropological society and en-


the pocpullcr magazine

titled can monkeys talk they can
when mr cuttens telegram was handed
to him

  imagine if you can an amateur sci-
entist nature faker or whatever one
may be pleased to term such a queer
individual as jared cutten presumed
to be the court of last resort in matters
snaky receiving a telegram like that
without being able to answer it con-
template for a moment the blow to
jared cuttens vanity-he who had
studied the habits of every snake in
every zoo in the world and any number
of snakes not confined in zoos-jared
cutten author of serpent worship
the man who knew every kink and fold
in the spine of a snake from the time it
was a fish until it became neither fish
flesh nor fowl but a pterodactyl and
flew and had a two-foot bill with teeth
in it and gradually grew into a snake
and crawled imagine his humiliation
when he discovered that for once in his
life he was stumped

  now to be stumped by a stranger is
nothing but to be caught asleep at the
switch by the discoverer of the fero-
cious argentine ant in america and
that man a mere nephew was a matter
which didnt sit well on uncle jareds
stomach the buck was clearly up to
him and he realized that unless he
could answer the question he might as
well go to the end of the class

  a snake had swallowed a white or-
pington egg-a simple thing like an egg
and here he was appealed to by the
only nephew who had ever appealed to
him as worth the powder to-ahem
ahumph that is appealed to as the
high priest of reptilian lore-and un-
able to deliver the goods it was ter-
rible

  uncle jared realized that james r
cutten was not a frivolous man for he
had discovered the argentine ant he
realized that he was not an avaricious
man for he had requested his answer
collect he had not seen james for
many years but he had understood
from hearsay evidence that james was
doing well come to think of it
james brother who called religiously
twice a week had informed him upon

the occasion of his last visit that james
had retired and was supposed to be
worth considerable money conse-
quently and in view of the fact that
he had written james congratulating
him on the ant discovery this telegram
could by no possibility be a far-fetched
scheme to patch up the silence and-er
-neglect of years on the contrary
there was every reason for jared cutten
to believe that his nephew had inher-
ited his-jareds-penchant for scien-
tific research and if so uncle jared
could not afford to be caught four-
flushing he would spar for time and
in the interim dig into the authorities
on snakeology so he sent this mes-
sage to james r cutten	

  what kind of a snake

  three hours later with the problem
still unsolved he received this reply

  spilotcs couperi unusually large

  it was the knock-out blow while
uncle jared did not know it mr cut-
ten at the suggestion of his brother-in-
law had looked up the word gopher
snake in websters unabridged diction-
ary and fastened onto that latin desig-
nation like a bulldog to a tramp

 ha gasped uncle jared a
burrowing colubrine commonly known
as the gopher snake by jupiter james
is no dub himself when it comes to
snakes i cant fence with him another
minute and this affair is worthy of in-
vestigation ill confess my ignorance

  so he wired his nephew

  no data obtainable on colubrinss my ob-
servations of digestion of nonvenomous
snakes rather perfunctory or could answer
your query immediately intensely interested
in case now under your notice am com-
ing down to investigate line cardboard box
heavily with cotton batting thus minimizing
danger of snake threshing body against
sides of box and crushing egg prior to di-
gestion confine snake in box and handle
very carefully watch snake continuously
until i arrive noting signs of gradual col-
lapse of egg if any make note exact hour
snake swallowed egg if such data obtain-
able will arrive your town eight-forty-
three meet me at the station

  that telegram reached mr cutten at
five oclock next morning being deliv-
mr cuttens revolt



ered to him in the hen house where hcs
had sat all night overcoated and blank-
eted among his orpingtons watching
every movement of the snake by the
light of an electric torch which he kept
burning steadily the snake after suc-
cessfully negotiating the egg had en-
deavored to escape but mr cutten had
tickled its nose with a straw each time
it appeared over the edge of the box so
that the snake quickly withdrew and lay
coiled in the nest considering the situa-
tion eventually becoming sleepy and
torpid he tied himself up in a lovers 
knot and went to sleep

  we are reliably informed that when
young lochinvar came out of the west
and eloped with the bride there was
considerable racing and chasing around
the home of the brides parents well
that may be but the racings and chas-
ings that went on around the cutten es-
tablishment following the receipt of
that telegram made all the racings and
chasings of history look like the demure
activities of a dorcas society

  for the first time in her married life
mrs cutten got up early and cooked
breakfast for mr cutten marshall
who hitherto had occupied the spare
bedroom was given terse orders to va-
cate and thereafter sleep on a couch in
the dining room and airs cutten flew
to make the guest chamber ready
against the arrival of the honored guest

  she was too happy for anything to
think of receiving a letter two tele-
grams and a visit from the rich rela-
tion all within the short space of one
week she resolved that no stone
should be left unturned to make his
stay a pleasant one to the end that
upon his death it might be discovered
that he had been kind to her husband
already she considered uncle jareds
estate as good as settled in mr cut-
tens favor and her mind was busy with
half-formed plans for the rehabilitation
of the hackfords and her own social
aggrandizement

  the news that his learned relative
had condescended to share with him his
observations even in such a compara-
tively unimportant matter as the diges-
tion of an egg in the stomach of a

gopher snake filled the honest mr cut-
ten with a sort of holy joy leaving
marshall to watch over the snake with
instructions to call him in case the sig-
nificant lump should commence to sub-
side mr cutten raced for the house
swallowed a cup of hot coffee-for he
was chilled and cramped after his night
in the hennery-and then commenced
a frantic search of the house for a
suitable cardboard box and a roll of
cotton batting to his great distress
neither were to be found so springing
into the racy roadster he tore uptown
through the silent streets with his cut-
off open rang the night bell of the local
druggist secured the box and a huge
roll of absorbent cotton and disre-
garding the earnest queries of the drug-
gist as to who had been injured he re-
turned to the house

  here he arranged the receptacle for
the snake as per his uncles instruc-
tions  then drawing on a heavy auto-
mobile glove he got his courage in
hand grasped the snake firmly by the
middle and gently deposited him in
his snowy couch marshall was then
to his huge disgust requested to get
busy and clean up the chicken yard and
accomplish sundry other little chores to
make the place tidy while within the
house mrs cutten was frantically
sweeping and dusting

  marshall sflid mr cutten as the
hour for the arrival of the train drew
near take the runabout and go down
to the station for my uncle youll
recognize him immediately hes a
cutten from heels to hair apologize
to him for me for not coming in per-
son but tell him i dassent leave the
snake

  so marshall went to the station
while mr cutten remained on watch
about nine oclock marshall returned
with uncle jared and the formalities
of greeting over with mrs cutten the
old gentleman went at once to the ga-
rage and greeted his nephew his old
eyes glowed with interest when mr
cutten called his attention to the bulge
in the reptile showing where the undi-
gested egg reposed

  a remarkable case nephew said


the vovulacr magazine

he a truly remarkable case know-
ing of my interests in such matters it
was thoughtful and kind of you indeed
to apprise me of the facts i appreciate
it i assure you and now as you have
been on watch all night i suggest that
you retire for some much-needed sleep
and leave the case to me

  mildly protesting that he was not in
the least fatigued mr cutten never-
theless permitted himself to be per-
suaded to abandon the garage for his
bed where he slept soundly until five
oclock when he arose and relieved
uncle jared for dinner after dinner
uncle jared retired and slept until mid-
night when he arose and relieved mr
cutten who thereupon went to bed and
slept until seven next morning

  any new developments uncle he
inquired as he entered the garage

  none-so far as the egg is con-
cerned but the snake appears nervous
and uncomfortable

  thats to be expected mr cutten
bent over the prisoner his eyes are
glazed and half closed he added i
do believe he has indigestion

  well thats to be expected also
replied the author of serpent wor-
ship according to all available in-
formation he has been eating an egg
a day and if hes swallowed them
whole his system must be plumb full of
eggshells the glazed eye is significant
of a state of coma common to all rep-
tiles after gorging although his actions
for the past two hours are in direct con-
travention of that torpidity which we
have every reason to suspect under the
circumstances i do not recall a more
marvelous case

  well he appears to have quieted
down suggested mr cutten so you
had better go in to breakfast in the
event of any new symptoms i will call
you

  by all means do replied uncle
jared and departed for the house
after breakfast he lay down for forty
winks about the forty-first wink
which happened to be late in the after-
noon he was awakened by mr cutten
shaking him gently

  whats up he demanded

  the snake is dead

  mr cutten made the announcement
with as much solemnity as if the de-
parted had been a warm personal
friend

  the devil you say and the egg
is-

   is still undigested

  well have a post-mortem an-
nounced uncle jared springing out of
bed and into his slippers got a good
sharp knife james

  mr cutteij had such a weapon and
together they repaired to the garage
mr marshall hackford was there also
surveying the defunct egg-swallowing
snake and as uncle jared lifted the car-
cass out of the box and stretched it on
the floor of the garage mr cutten saw
marshall turn away to hide a snicker

  what are you laughing at-you
demanded mr cutten sternly he de-
-sired no undue hilarity at such a mo-
ment and in the presence of his serious-
minded relative

  wait replied mr hackford with
suppressed emotion youll see for
yourself in a minute

  and so they did uncle jared deftly
slit the snake up the belly removed the
egg and tapped it tentatively with the
blade of the knife

  the egg appears to be in perfect
condition began uncle jared the
acids of the stomach have had no ap-
parent effect- holy sailor

  marshall hackford whooped aloud
bent double and sat down in uncontrol-
lable mirth as uncle jared picked up
the gory relic and thrust it under mr
cuttens nose

  it was a porcelain nest egg

well james said uncle jared
frigidly all ive got to say is that
youre a peach of a scientist you are
har-r-r-r shouted mr hackford
and rolled on the floor of the garage

  mr cutten flushed a rosy red and
hung his head i didnt know it he
said humbly he looked about him as
if in search of a hole into which he
might plunge and his pitiful glance fell
upon his worthless brother-in-law roll-
ing on the floor and chortling with glee
mr cuttens revolt



at the horrible predicament in which
james r cutten was involved

  you-you knew this right along
didnt you marshall he said weakly

  mr hackford finished his laugh be-
fore it occurred to him to have the
manners to nod his head affirmatively

  it wras unkind and ungenerous of
you not to tell me said mr cutten
sadly i must confess my surprise and
chagrin marshall i am deeply
pained

  it was too good said marshall
wiping away the tears of mirth if
youd only looked for yourself a little

closer-har-har-before the snake-

oh lord this will be the death of me
-before the snake swallowed the egg
youd have noticed it jimmy you
need spectacles jimmy youve worked
-har-har-too long under electric

lights-har-har-har- and mr

hackford leaned against the wall of
the garage and commenced all over
again jared cutten stood staring at
him apparently undecided whether to
fly into a rage and proclaim himself in-
sulted or take the whole thing as a
joke

  yes marshall said mr cutten
sadly i have worked under electric
lights too long but i worked for the
hackfords and i was a fool to do it
this is my thanks--

  the sight of you two serious-mind-
ed old nuts watching that snake wmild
have made a cow laugh proclaimed
marshall 

  the world swam red before mr cut-
tens eyes he saw the trap into which
the artful marshall had led him he
thought of all he had done for the lazy
beggar of the miserable selfish greedy
hackford nature against which he had
struggled so cheerfully all of his mar-
ried life only to be made a fool of in
the end and the monstrous imposition
which was being practiced upon him by
this overgrown baby marshall was for
the first time really apparent to mr
cutten his learned his brilliant uncle
jared had been made the laughingstock
of this contemptible laughing jackass-
jared cutten author of serpent wor-
ship patron of science had been re-

ferred to as a serious-minded old nut
and uncle jared was his guest true
an uninvited guest brought down from
the city on a crazy errand but an hon-
ored and a welcome guest nevertheless

  mr cutten from long practice could
readily assimilate a shabby deal directed
against himself but against his honored
guest such a joke took on the dimen-
sions of a deadly insult and with a
sudden - lust for murder mr cutten
cast about him for a weapon nothing
presented itself except the limp corpse
of the victim of misplaced confidence
but that would do

  you big bum he snarled you
great contemptible malingering beg-
garly lazy leech  ive supported you in
idleness for my wifes sake and you
have imposed on my good nature you
have humiliated me and now you have
the nerve to stand there and snicker at
my uncle jared ive stood for all that
im going to stand from you and now
im through take that you tramp
and he struck mr hackford a stinging
blow with the late lamented

  he continued to strike until marshall
with a shriek of horror broke from the
garage and fled for the house and
the protection of mrs cutten uncle
jared filled with alarm at the sight of
mr cuttens terrible anger attempted
to restrain his nephew

  leggo shouted mr cutten leg-
go i tell you im a boob im an ass 
im a monkey but too much is plenty
and enough is always sufficient ive
been taking dirt from the hackfords
for twenty years but to-day it ends
leggo i tell you ive got a little
housecleaning to do and im going to
do it

  so uncle jared let him go and he
departed on the trail of the viper he had
been nursing in his bosom

  from the interior of the house pres-
ently came the sound of a terrible hub-
bub uncle jared heard mrs cutten
scream then he saw the front door
open and down the steps came mr
marshall hackford on the toe of mr
cuttens gpod right foot

  skidoo you hobo out of my
house and stay out-kick-and if


the cpocpular magazine

you ever come back-another kick-
ill kill you skip you simpleton and
hustle your daily bread work or
starve-swat-you poor dear deli-
cate-

  words failed mr cutten besides
he was pursuing mr hackford up the
street and he required his breath for
running marshall scrambled over a
fence and disappeared across a vacant
lot running for dear life mr cutten
shook his fist after him

  yes ill put up three thousand dol-
lars to buy you a pool parlor wont i 
you bet iwill-not and hurling a
cuss word after the vanquished one-
a thing mr cutten had never done in
all his previous life-he returned to the
house where uncle jared was endeav-
oring to soothe mrs cutten

  you brute she shrilled at mr
cutten as he entered the front door

  cut that said mr cutten chop
it-quick where do you get that chat-
ter he came close to her and sud-
denly she calmed for there was a gleam
in mr cuttens eye which showed he
meant business he continued

  my love and his voice was as
calm and gentle as it had ever been
you choose right now between your
husband and your family under-
stand  mrs cutten hung her hea
and a crocodile tear started across her
cheek any time you want to sepa-
rate yourself from a good thing youll
invite that contemptible rascal back to
this house or let me catch you giving
him money and my shirts and neckties
one hackfords enough for me mrs
cutten two is a crowd and im not
so old that i cant put up a rattling good
scrap when my guest is insulted under
my roof marshall is off our list and
off for keeps never forget it

  mrs cutten departed up the stairs
sobbing softly mr cutten turned to
uncle jared

  uncle jared was smiling at him ap-
provingly james said he i was
always of the impression that you were
a mild man-too mild in fact

  oh i have my off days replied
mr cutten carelessly im a devil
when things go wrong and every once
in a while i have to prove that im old
man bluebeard around this ranch
uncle jared slapped him on the back
quite right my boy quite right a
man must assert his authority occa-
sionally but for all that-you shouldnt
be so quick-tempered it was a rattling
good joke come to consider it although
i was angry myself for a minute how-
ever james you have been very severe
i suggest that you go upstairs and
apologize to your wife

  mr cutten laughed-a short and
ugly laugh he shook his head

  you dont know james r cutten
he said i rule my house with a rod
of iron i have to sorry to have had
this vulgar domestic row during your
visit but he who hesitates is lost i
maintain peace in my family if i have
to fight for it

  right then uncle jared made up his
mind that james r cutten was his fa-
vorite nephew and legitimate heir all
his life he had harbored the notion that
mr cutten was a milksop he was
mistaken the man was every inch a
man he was firm as adamant he
had character and courage he was all
right

  uncle jared slipped his arm through
mr cuttens

  james he said lets go back and
bury that dog-gone snake

by charles e van loan

author of the national commission decides lta right leg or a

 reputation   etc

    why bud left home the story of a unique ball game played in the little town
    of saratoga wyoming high and dry among the sage of carbon county a
    game in which the contestants are the baltimore bloomer girls b b c and
    a bunch of mere men that thought they knew something about playing ball

his back was turned to me but the
mournful howl of an automo-
bile siren caused him to crane
his neck anxiously thus fur-
nishing me with a mental snapshot of
his profile it had been three years
since together we had flicked battered
trout flies across the pools of the north
platte forty miles south of fort
steele in wyoming at that time he
had not worn the gaudy habiliments of
the ridiculous curbstone ornament
scornfully recognized in certain por-
tions of the west as a city cow-
puncher yet in spite of his bizarre
disguise i recognized bud mckinstry
at once

  bud was the friend of a friend of a
very dear friend of mine and his home
when he had need of one was in the
little town of saratoga wyoming
high and dry among the sage of car-
bon county but wrhat he was doing
in the shade of the flatiron building
on manhattan island and why he wore
an enormous gray flop-brimmed som-
brero with a snakeskin band a blue
flannel shirt with a red-and-yellow ban-
danna for a tie high-heeled boots and
a few other obsolete trfnkets were
things which required explanation if
not apology

  so i tapped him gently upon the
shoulder and where is the fancy-
dress ball i asked

 bud jumped when he felt the weight

of my hand and the face which he
turned to me blazed with sudden sus-
picion it changed immediately into a
mask of pleased surprise

  well well he cried wringing my
hand its you aint it yes its
you and i thought it was a bunko
steerer i sure did well l-o-o-ong
time ino see you eh why aint you
ever been out fishing again 

  this and much more came tumbling
from buds lips but when he caught
me examining his regalia with a grin
the pleased ejaculations dribbled away
into embarrassed silence i must say
for bud that he had the grace to seem
ashamed of himself

  when at home-in carbon county
wyoming-bud clerks in a dry-goods
store and wears clothes which are to
quote the catalogue of the chicago mail-
order house the last expiring sigh of
fashions latest whimsy elegantly sim-
ple simply elegant cut fit and texture
guaranteed which is to say that the
coats run to phenomenally long slender
lapels buttons in unexpected places
and the trousers to three-inch cuffs

  why the masquerade i demanded
is there a warrant out for your ar-
rest  have you done anything which
you couldnt tell a friend  if baldy

sisson could see you now-

  buds face shamed the bandannas
flaming scarlet

  oh said he i guess you aint

    van loans new series of baseball stories began in the first may popular back numbers can be
obtained from news dealers

a


the popular magazine

heard the news im in the show busi-
ness now

  and therefore cant look any one in
the eye i said which is it-wild
west vaudeville or the moving pic-
tures  gut with it

  its the movies said bud with a
sickly grin ye-eh im a regular actor
now riding the range in new jersey
while larry turns the crank quite a
bunch of us came over at the same time
-under contract two carloads of
brones some of em outlaws

  tell it to the press agent i said
sternly you ride an outlaw you
bud im ashamed of you

  shucks said bud uneasily of
course they aint none of em what you
might call man-eaters but theyre fee-
rocious enough for new jersey run
the film fast and it looks like the real
thing

  but i didnt know you could ride at
all i persisted cruelly

  aw let go pleaded bud what
folks dont know wont never keep em
awake nights i can sit up in the mid-
dle of em all right i got a strap fixed
through the saddle and--

  pulling leather eh il certainly
have to write a letter to baldy sisson
dont you do it cried bud quick-
ly dont you i might want to go
back to that town some day they
laughed me out of it once and i
wouldnt wish to have em do it again
and baldy hes the longest strongest
laugher of the bunch you can hear
him plum to w olcott when he gets
tuned up dont you write him if you
got any humanity in you at all be-
sides he continued lamely i dont
want to get my fool neck broke for a
measly twenty-five a week-not right
in front of a picture machine anyway
you wouldnt either i never claimed
to be a thad sowder nor yet a harry
brennan and-well anyhow the strap
wont show in the films he paused
and eyed me with a curious mixture of
importunity and defiance dont you
go and wrrite baldy he repeated

  i wont i promised if you can
give me any good excuse for traipsing

around new york in a pawnee bill
make-up

  why sure said bud hastily
thats easy i was working over
there in the jungles this morning
something went wrong and they gave
us all half a day off i didnt have no
time to change thats on the level
and anyway-was there a trace of
disappointment in buds voice -
people here dont seem to pay any at-
tention to you no matter zvhat you
wear

  of course not i said long-
haired men and short-haired women
create no excitement in this town bud
these people have seen everything in
the freak line and they wrouldnt turn
around to look at you if you valked up
fifth avenue on your hands theyd
think you wrere advertising rattlesnake
oil or peddling souvenirs from the
alamo you look the part

  aw dry up said bud weakly
some of the boys are worsen i am
theres charlie fothergill he wears
blue angora chaps day and night you
remember charlie he used to work in
the drug store at saratoga the bluest
blue you ever saw and a green silk
shirt with a canary handkerchief
thats going too far it seems to me
say is there any place in this town
where a fellow can go and see things
on his afternoon off

  why yes i said a fellow might
go down to the aquarium and give the
fish a treat-theyve got some wyoming
trout down there that would probably
be tickled to death to see even an imita-
tion cow-puncher or a fellow might
run out to the museum of natural
history and see the stuffed animals
then theres the baseball game you
ought to be interested in baseball
seems to me you pitched ftfr the ante-
lopes come on out to the polo
grounds and see the giants and the
cubs thats always a fight worth the
money

  no sir said bud shaking his head
vigorously dont mention baseball to
me im off that game for life he
spoke bitterly and it seemed to me with
a great deal of unnecessary heat but
the chwaury of cakon county



for a ball game i wouldnt be here
id choose the stuffed animals for
mine lead me to em

  bud had twice hinted at a story but
i knew him better than to attempt to
extract his confidence corkscrew fash-
ion when time and mood were ripe he
would tell me and not before but i be-
lieved i knew a sure way to hasten the
ripening process

  with this end in view i carefully
steered him into that wing of the mu-
seum which contains the american bird
groups each in a marvelous stage set-
ting of its own where real earth grass
and foliage blend into painted canvas so
skillfully that the sharpest eye cannot
trace the dividing line between the real
and the unreal and the brain is tricked
into impressions of far horizons and
deep vistas of open country

  this said bud disgustedly is the
bunk dyou believe a bird ever had a
neck like that he indicated a fla-
mingo with a jerk of his thumb lets
go back and see old dinah-what-you-
may-call him again  him with the bones
it says on the card that he came from
wyoming if he did it must have
been before my time if id ever met
anything like that rambling over them
hills i  surely have taken the pledge
just a minute i said and dont
hurry so youve got the whole after-
noon

  then bud who was in front paused
with a gurgle of pure delight

  hey he called come here and
look at these little old sage hens aint
they natural though watch that fel-
low strut say thats what i call neat
thats just the way you see em out in
carbon county

  ever seen that country before i
inquired innocently

  bud fell back a pace and his eyes
swept the canvas background

  moses and the prophets he ejacu-
lated seizing me by the arm in liis
excitement look aint that elk
mountain over there it is as sure as
youre a foot high theres the canon
where the trout creek comes down
say this aint no fake this is the real
thing its a little chunk cut out of

gods country its home thats what
it is-home carbon county right here
in new york m-m-m-m-mph oh
lordy

  my moving-picture cow-puncher sat
down on a bench and babbled incoher-
ently to himself while his eyes took in
each faithful detail of a well-remem-
bered scene the artist had contrived
to counterfeit the deep crystal atmos-
phere of that wonderful land which lies
along the ridgepole of the continent
and as one sense calls to another to
see elk mountain lying purple in the
distance was to smell again the clean
wind of that mile-high country-the
wind and the odor of the sage

  from mutterings and ejaculations
bud passed into a reverie chin in his
hands after some tirriehe arose sud-
denly shook himself like a wet spaniel
and started for the exit

  come on he said thickly i want
to get out of this bird theater as quick
as i can your blame pinny-poppy
show has made me homesick

  under the trees outside i waited for
what i knew must come

  weve still got time to go to the ball
game i hinted

  buds language in response to this
suggestion would not be a pretty sight
in type more silence

  say demanded bud did you ever
see a female baseball club

  i said that i understood there were
such organizations but that i had never
seen one bud drew out a sack of to-
bacco and a packet of brown papers

  youre lucky he said wisht i
never had

  and then with the spell of the sage-
brush upon him and a two-thousand-
miles-away look in his eyes my new
jersey roughrider opened his heart

  speaking of baseball said he by
way of preface that team we had in
saratoga wasnt the softest in the state
by no means we whaled the everlast-
ing daylights out of everything between
green river and laramie of course
the rawlins bunch put one over on us
when they hired five professionals from
cheyenne they beat us three to two
in eleven innings and if it hadnt been


the voula magazine

for the ringers they wouldnt have
stood a show in the world

  one day last june i met baldy sis-
son on the street he was waving an
envelope kind of excitedlike baldy
used to run the team-him and com-
stock

   say bud says baldy ive got a
game for next saturday and then he
opens up the letter right across the
top of the page it says in big blue
print baltimore bloomer girls base-
ball chib just like that well of
course id heard about female ball
clubs traveling through the country and
giving a kind of a burlesque on the
game but none of em ever came our
way

   you aint a-going to stack us up
against anything as soft as that are
you  i asks

   how do you know theyre soft
says baldy they beat a lot of teams
in colorado and they ought to be a
good attraction

  well that part of it sounded rea-
sonable but theres a lot of difference
between a good attraction and a good
show ever think of that

   im going to telegraph that man-
ager to come running says baldy

  youd be surprised to know what an
excitement was kicked up in that town
when word got around that a she-male
ball team was coming in a day or so
baldy got a big roll of advertising pos-
ters in the mail all colors on the
top was a picture-made from a photo-
graph it was-of a girl in a baseball
uniform well not a regular uniform
exactly part of it sort of looked like
a skirt to me loose and bunched up
at the knee under the picture it said

miss pansy demarr

the peerless shortstop of the baltimore
bloomer girls b b c

  you know how a fellows mind will
get to running on photographs and
things the minute i saw pansys pic-
ture i was glad baldy had made the
date for us she was a bird pansy
was young and considerable of a
looker you cant fake up an old girl
so that she looks like sweet sixteen it

shows through somehow even in a pho-
tograph yes pansy was young and as
cute as a little sage rabbit i wasnt
the only one in town that took a shine
to her curt mahaffey stole one of the
posters and took it home with him

  well there was other things on the
poster too a genuine scientific exhi-
bition of inside baseball was what it
said as played by the leading female
exponents of the national game there
was a lot of that kind of hog-wash and
then came a string of newspaper write-
ups and not a knock amongst em
down at the bottom was a string of
scores according to the posters the
girls had cleaned up mostly all of kan-
sas and by awful one-sided figures at
that it got us to thinking

   you dont suppose this is on the
level do you says henry kamphef-
ner our first baseman did they beat
all these clubs or is this just an adver-
tising fake  and them newspaper ac-
counts  did they pay for them or
how 

  well we talked it all over and made
up our minds that we couldnt afford
to have a lot of bloomer ladies travel-
ing through wyoming advertising that
they had licked the saratoga ante-
lopes that sort of thing would set
the town back ten years and make us
the laughingstock of the state

   heres howt well do it says jeff
bloodgood our catcher well play
these girls all right enough and we
wont be any rougher with em than wte
have to be well hand them a nice
polite gentlemanly trimming-say
about twenty-five to nothing-and if
they paste tip any lies about us well
sue for libel and defalcation of charac-
ter anyhow well tell em wrell sue
and thatll scare em xone of these
fly-by-night shows like to get mixed
up with the courts

   yes says fred gilroy the short-
stop we can do that r else take a
poke at their manager hes a man
aint he

  but we decided that wouldnt an-
swer jeffs idea was the best

  well saturday morning came and
most of us were down at the depot to
the chivalry of cazbon county



see the bloomer troupe come in i
didnt hardly think theyd wear em in
the streets but jeff bloodgood did
he said theyd do it for the advertising

  as soon as the train came in sight
we spotted an extra coach-a pullman
sleeper it was

   humph  says billy french one of
our boys they put on plenty of dog
dont they private car you lose
dan

  dan mclaurin our second base-
man was pretty much peeved about
that private car and i dont blame him
dan runs the hotel and hed been fig-
uring on some transients had the
whole place cleaned up on purpose and
went out at daylight to catch a mess of
trout for dinner id have been sore
too

  well we stood around and watched
em switch the pullman onto the siding
by the depot that car was a regular
rolling hotel with a cook house and
everything complete and when dan saw
the smoke coming out of the roof he
said he didnt care how bad wed beat
em but he hoped it wouldnt be less
than fifty to nothing

  i got a peek at one of the bloomer
ladies she was setting by a window
combing her hair and fixing up a lot of
yellow puffs and things and her mouth
was full of hairpins i knew right
away that she wouldnt answer to the
name of pansy no there wasnt noth-
ing delicate about that lady or young
either some folks like these big pref-
erential blondes some dont me id
just as lieve their hair and eyebrows
would be the same color

  while we were sort of standing
around waiting for something to hap-
pen the yellow-headed lady looked out
and saw us you might have thought it
would embarrass her some to be caught
doing her hair in public that way but
this lady certainly wasnt the embar-
rassing kind she was the sort that can
look straight at a fellow until he be-
gins to wonder what there is about him
thats so peculiar

  she opened the window and stuck
her head out i took off my hat be-
cause im always polite but she didnt

seem to pay any attention to good man-
ners

   whats the matter with you yaps 
says she and her voice was like her
face-hard kind of shrill too like a
parrot what are you staring at little
boys  she goes on aint you ever
seen a lady before or havent you
got the price to see the game this
aint no free show so beat it while your
shoes are on your feet  git

  some more of the bloomer ladies
showed up at the windows and passed
out quite a line of conversation i
didnt see pansy among em so i came
away jeff bloodgood said afterward
that he stuck around and jollied em
back jeff always was a liar he
couldnt think fast enough to hold up
his end in a kidding match with those
ladies yes sir they seemed tof know
exactly what to say that would be the
hardest to answer right off the reel

  well we went up to dans place
and talked some more we decided
that a real licking might take some of
the freshness out of the bloomer peo-
ple then in came baldy sisson with a
big whale of a man that had a kind of
a wry neck baldy introduced him as
the manager of the girl team

  of course him being a man we
could talk to him and we started in i
dont know yet who made the first
break but all at once out conies a big
roll of bills and the wryneck said hed
take the short end of any two-to-onc
betting that might be flying around he
was mighty near mobbed and i sup-
pose all told we dug up close to two
hundred dollars dan locked the money
up in the safe until after the game

  i guess everybody in saratoga that
could walk turned out that afternoon
people came from away down by til-
tons ranch and over on jack creek it
was the biggest bunch i ever saw at a
ball game in the town

  we were practicing along about
two oclock when all at once the crowd
began to cheer and yell and here came
the bloomer ladies walking two by two
the big blonde out in front there was
a lot of laughing mixed up with the
applause that i didnt quite understand


the populcr magazine

at first but i mighty soon tumbled
there at the tail end of the line was
two of the biggest old battle-axes i ever
saw in my life one of em with a wind-
pad a catchers mitt and a mask and
the other one with an armful of bats
i began to laugh too until i noticed
that the one with the bats had a wry
neck then x got up closer both of
em had on bloomers and about forty
dollars worth of store hair and they
were painted and powdered and fussed
up to beat the band but a blind man
could have seen that those two battle-
axes were men dressed up in womens
clothes

  well there we were up against it
for a minute we didnt know whether
to make a kick or not henry kam-
phefner was our team captain and he
had bet forty bucks on the game

   look at them ringers says henry
maybe we ought to call the bets off

   call off nothing says dan mc-
laurin dan hadnt put up any two to
one you understand wed be joshed
to death about it let em have their
gentlemen friends for a battery if they
want em the rest of em are women
and if we cant beat seven women and
two men wed ought to be arrested

  that was reasonable again i took
a look and there wasnt any question
about the rest of the bloomer outfit
most of em had been women so long
that there wouldnt have been any ex-
cuse for mistaking em for anything
else some of those bloomer ladies
must have been playing baseball ever
since the war

  they knew their business all right
enough first thing they did was to
scatter through the crowd and take up
a collection there wasnt any fence
around the ball grounds but if any of
the folks in the crowd thought they
were going to see that game for noth-
ing they had another think coming

  i was warming up with jeff blood-
good when i caught sight of pansy and
forgot about everything else she was
a little late getting on the field the
posters hadnt flattered her a little bit
they hadnt even given her all that was
coming she was just about the neat-

est modestest little trick a man ever
treated his eyesight to and nothing like
the others they looked kind of loud
in that foolish baseball uniform but
pansy-why to look at her youd say
she never ought to wear any other kind
of clothes slim and neat and grace-
ful as a cat the others looked big and
clumsy beside her

  the bloomer ladies went through
that crowd joshing everybody right and
left and bawling out the cheap ones
something scandalous but pansy she
didnt have a word to say i know be-
cause i went over and borrowed a dol-
lar from george bainbridge and when
she came my way i dropped it into her
cap she looked up at me kind of sur-
prisedlike and then she smiled gee
it gave me a warm chill all over i
remember thinking at the time that it
was a privilege to give money to any
lady as pretty as pansy was did i tell
  she had brown eyes 

  well the bloomer ladies didnt take
much preliminary practice but the wry-
neck he got out and heaved a few to
the other fat lie-male and then him and
henry kamphefner tossed a coin the
wryneck called the turn and sent us to
bat first

 pansy went skipping down to
short the rest of the bloomer ladies
took their places and the big fat
catcher buzzed a couple down to sec-
ond a mile a minute pansy came
across to the bag like a big leaguer took
the throws as pretty as you would want
to see and chucked em back just like a
boy my how the crowd cheered her
pansy was the hit of the show right
from the start

  martin carey umpired and fred
gilroy our shortstop led ofif for us
the wryneck sort of uncoiled himself
and broke a fast one across freds let-
ters and all the bloomer ladies began
to chirp

   thats pitching they yelled
youve got everything to-day pearl
he couldnt hit you with an ironing
board girlie

  pearl and girlie what do you
think of that for gall

  well of course that first strike and
the chivaury of carbon county



all the joshing he got from the bloomer
ladies made fred mad and he took an
awful wallop at the next one it broke
toward him this time and he missed it
a foot that rattled him so that he
stood still and let carey call the third
one on him and what the bloomer peo-
ple did to fred when he walked away
from the plate was certainly plenty
ive seen some pretty fair single-handed
joshers in my time but the bloomer
ladies had it figured down to scientific
teamwork

   aint he the cute thing  chirps the
big blonde over on first base ill bet
his best girl saw him stand up there like
a cigar-store indian and let em call a
third strike on him

   mothers darling boy squawks the
old lady over on third dont let ha-
zel make you angry clarence

  there was plenty more of the same
kind and the crowd laughed fit to bust
it was as good as a show for them

  pete townes our third baseman
batted next pete chopped at the first
one and poked a little foul over back
of first the big blonde ran right into
the crowd and made a nice one-handed
stab all the bloomer ladies yelled
nice work hazel then they whirled
in on pete and told him a few things
about himself

  id been watching the wryneck and
beginning to see that we wasnt up
against any tapioca that old fat boy
was there he had swell curves a
dandy fast ball with a nice hop to it
and a change of pace and when you
come right down to it thats all the best
of em have got-that and control and
the wryneck didnt have no trouble put-
ting em where he wanted em to go

  while i was studying him he pulled
a stunt on charlie kennedy our cen-
ter fielder and the best hitter we had
that made me respect the wryneck more
than ever he had a strike on charlie
to begin with and he put another one
right in the same place charlie took a
good toe hold and lammed that ball
over third base pretty near a mile on a
line it struck foul though and that
made two strikes the wryneck saw
that he couldnt afford to let charlie hit

any more as hard as that and what do
you think he did hed been pitching
right-handed but he faced the other
way in the box and lobbed up the third
strike with his left when youre all
set for right-handed pitching and look-
ing for a wide outcurve it balls you up
something awful to have the next one
break from two feet outside the plate
and come in toward you charlie was
so paralyzed that he stood still and
never even offered at the ball id
heard of pitchers who could do that
stunt but i never saw one before
amphibious pitchers are scarce in any
mans country

  i saw then that i was going to have
to do some pitching myself and when
i walked out into the box i sort of
timed myself to meet pansy on the
way she gave me another smile id
noticed particular that when all the
other bloomer people were yelling that
pansy kept her mouth shut and at-
tended to business that made her
stronger with me than ever i like the
quiet ones myself

  well of course i was out there to
show those bottle blondes that they
didnt have the only pitcher on earth
up came the old third baselady
maudie they called her two of the
women were in the coachers boxes and
as soon as i got my toe on the slab they
started after me i usually stand that
sort of thing pretty good-from men
but what can you think of to say to a
lady that wears bloomers they
opened up on me for fair they talked
about my face and my feet and the way
my clothes fit me it was fierce i
know my foot is long but i take a nar-
row last

   come on maudie they squalled
heres oswald writh the big feet
hes out there on the hill and he aint
got a thing in the world but a chew of
tobacco and a prayer

  now thats a fine way for ladies to
talk aint it

  i didnt fool much with maudie
she wanted to bunt but i kept em too
high for her and she never even got a
foul then came hazel the big blonde
i owed her something for what she


the wpular magazine

said clown at the depot and i put the
first one so close to her nose that she
could have smelled it when it went by
she was hugging the plate anyway and
i wanted to drive her back hazel
didnt scare worth a cent she shook
her bat at me and danced up and down
and said if i beaned her shed bust it
over my head whats more i think
she meant it

  i fed her the old mckinstry special
the wide outdrop and she missed two
of em hazel was no piker shed
swing at anything she could reach i
figured shed be looking for a third one
so i banged the ball straight over she
shut her eyes and popped a fluky lit-
tle texas leaguer back of first base
pure luck hazel wasnt built for speed
but any fat lady could have made first
on that hit i was mad enough to fight
until i looked up and saw pansy at the
plate-pansy and her cute little bat

  come on girlie squalled the
coachers heres where we put the
rollers under oswald get a hit girlie
get a hit

  i hated to do it but i slipped pansy
one over the inside corner that nearly
took jeff off his feet i was going to
show her that i was a pitcher if i didnt
do anything else i tried it again
pansy swung with all her might and
the ball came back at me like it was shot
out of a gun i just had time to get
my glove up in front of my face when
bam the ball hit right in the middle
of it and stuck there i chucked it
over to henry kamphefner on first
and we doubled hazel by forty feet but
somehow i felt kind of rotten about
robbing pansy of that hit

   take the horseshoes out of your
pockets oswald  squalls hazel when
she finally got it through her head that
wed stopped em with a double play
pretty lucky  pretty lucky 

 i ran into pansy again as we
changed sides and this time she grinned
when she saw me coming

   pretty tough little one i says
a foot on either side and that ball
would be going yet she never said a
word just trotted out and picked up
her glove

  well thats the way it started
skipping the details the wryneck
pitched swell elegant baseball and
when he got in a hole hed switch and
roll a few down the alley with his
left he had us all swinging like a
farmyard gate and when youve got
a team doing that youve got the
boys guessing we put some men
on the bases here and there but we
didnt seem to be able to hit em
around and there wasnt much nour-
ishment in trying to steal-not with
pansy covering the bag and handling
the throw the wryneck hit me an
awful soak in the ribs in the third in-
ning and i did my level darndest to
steal second because i wanted to be
where i could talk to pansy im sup-
posed to be a pretty fast little fellow
on my feet and i was up and gone
with the wrynecks wing but that fat
catcher slammed the ball down like a
white streak and when i arrived feet
first pansy had the ball waiting for me

  along about the sixth we slipped a
run across pete townes drew a base
on balls charlie kennedy pushed him
along with a sacrifice bunt and billy
french brought him home with a single
to center you bet that one run looked
mighty good to us wed forgotten all
aboutbeating those bloomer ladies forty
to nothing and considering the way the
wryneck was going we were thankful
for that ace it looked big enough to
win with but in the eighth we had an-
other guess old double-barrel tied the
score on us

  i hadnt been worrying so much
about the wryneck being a hitter be-
cause hed been swinging at anything
but he came up first in the eighth and
tied into one good and plenty it would
have been a home run if he hadnt been
so fat of course he blamed it on the
altitude he got as far as third base
and then he sat down on the bag with
his tongue hanging out a foot his
bloomer friends certainly knew the fine
points of the game hazel broke a
shoe lace and took five minutes to fix
it and then pansy had to stop to do
up her hair and maudies belt got
twisted and between em all they gave
the chivalry of cmbon county



the old rascal a fine breathing spell
at that id have left him marooned on
third base if fred gilroy hadnt played
ping-pong with a blfll that myrtle hit
straight at him fred made a high peg
to the plate jeff had to jump for it
and he came down square on top of the
wryneck ive never seen a hippopota-
mus slide to the plate but i dont need
to i saw the wryneck and there we
was with the score tied up and the ninth
inning coming

  by this time we was pretty much
worked up about them two-to-one bets
and the bloomer ladies were chirping
like a lot of canaries that one run put
a lot of life into em

  we didnt do any good in our half
of the ninth and then here was
maudie again leading off for the ladies
maudie was tolerable soft for me she
was afraid of a fast ball and i didnt
give her anything else three strikes
for maudie the bloomer ladies rooted
hard for hazel but i got her in a hole
and made her swing at a curve and she
went back

  pansy waltzed up to the plate she
had a bigger bat this time pansy
hadnt hit a ball out of the diamond all
the afternoon and henry kamphef-
ner whod been reading the magazines
and thought he knew all about inside
baseball wigwagged to the outfielders
to get in close	v

  when i saw that big bat i had to
laugh it was most as big as pansy
was

   hey little one i sings out what
are you going to do with that telegraph
pole 

  pansy laughed back at me waved
her hand and then i hope i may choke
if she didnt throw me a kiss honest
injun thats just what she did you
could have knocked me down wtith a
lead pencil

  next thing i knew there was a ter-
rible racket over back of first base
hazel and maudie and myrtle and jen-
nie and all the rest of the bloomer
ladies were yelling at martin carey

  mister umpire oh mister um-
pire 

  well whats wrong now says

martin the crowd hushed up to listen
to their kick hazel cut loose with a
howl that you could have heard half a
mile away

    you make that pitcher stop flirting
with pansy she bawls hes been
making goo-goo eyes at her all through
the game you make him quit it
well she got the crowd a-going and
i suppose thats what she wanted
laugh  they laughed their heads off
first thing i knew my ears were burn-
ing up and i didnt hardly know what
end i was on ill bet if id took off my
shoes and dropped my glove id have
gone straight up in the air like a bal-
loon

    come on there  yells hazel quit
stalling and pitch call time on him
mister umpire

  i must have been pretty badly rat-
tled wasnt that bawl-out enough to
rattle anybody i set myself to pitch
but i was so plum full of other ideas
and things that i mislaid the plate en-
tirely and before i knew it there was
hazel and maudie and the rest of those
squaws doing a ghost dance along the
side lines and the crowd roaring like
a menagerie at dinner time

  whats the count martin i says
you can tell how upset i must have
been to ask a question like that

   three balls and no strikes says
martin for the love of heaven bud
take a brace  dont let those old bat-
tle-axes scare you steady down and
get em over

  well i knew i had to do it i
aimed the next one straight down the
groove and there wasnt a thing on that
ball but the cover-not a thing with
three and nothing i figured that pansy
would wait me out for a base on balls
and i heaved that one up there as
straight as i knew how looking to cut
the plate where it was biggest

  pansy saw that it was a groover
and back went that big bat and then
bing she landed on it as hard as she
could swing i got one flash at the ball
as it went out over my head it was
another one of those low line drives i
whirled around and there was charlie
kennedy and billy french and george


the vovulatr magazine

perkins all hitting the high spots in
the direction of the river kamphefner
had pulled em in close and pansy had
crossed us by lamming it out over their
heads

  the next thing i noticed was pansy
rounding second base and run she
could have given a coyote a head start
and run him breathless around them
bags she was straightened out for
third before charlie caught up with
the ball at all pan mclaurin had
the best wing in the infield and he
ran back to handle the relay charlie
let fly just as pansy rounded third base
and dan made a chain-lightning peg to
the plate but little pansy hit the dirt
like a avalanche and jeff never did find
her in the dust she kicked up

  safe yells martin carey and
there went our old ball game two to
one and licked by the bloomer ladies 
jeff bloodgood heaved the ball away
he was so mad i dont blame him

  bud paused and rolled another ciga-
rette whistling between his teeth as
he did so i offered some consolatory
remarks but bud held up a restrain-
ing hand

  wait he said the worst is yet
to come i wouldnt have left home for
a little thing like that

  he lighted his cigarette blew a few
clouds from deep down in his lungs and
resumed his narrative

  after the game the wryneck took
off his wig and so did the catcher and
they went up to the hotel with our
bunch the girls beat it back to the
private car dan got the money out of
the safe and turned it over to the wry-
neck i got to say for him that he acted
like a true sport and did the right thing
by the gang then dan said wed all
have one on the house and we did and
then some more of the boys had a
stroke of enlargement of the heart and
then the wryneck started it all over
again it got to be quite a party after
a while the wryneck he said wed
given him the toughest battle of the
season so far but then i guess he was
just salving us a little goodness knows
he could afford to

  other folks dropped in and finally
there must have been fifty or sixty of
us then some one-no it wasnt me
-suggested that it would be a right
cute little idea to go down to the depot
and give three cheers for the bloomer
girls just to show em that we were
true sports and knew how to lose like
gentlemen everybody thought well of
the scheme and then luke fosdick got
up on a table and said if we were going
to do anything of that sort we might
just as well do it right

   well get the band boys together
and go down there and give em a sere-
nade  says luke luke played the
e-flat cornet and thought he was quite
a bunch on that solo business

  well that wasnt any trouble be-
cause most of the band boys were with
the gang they rustled out their in-
struments and away we went across the
bridge and over toward the depot the
band taking an awful fall out of that
hot time in the old town piece we
marched up alongside of that private
car and opened the celebration with
three cheers then the band played
some more-rotten it was-and the
wryneck went into the car and brought
out some of the bloomer ladies and in-
troduced em they didnt look any
better to me in their regular clothes

  i rubbered and i rubbered but i
didnt see anything of pansy so after a
while i edged over to hazel who had
borrowed the bass drum and was lead-
ing the band and i asked her about it

   wheres the little shortstop i
says why dont you trot her out
this is her party and she oughtnt to
run out on it this way

  hazel threw back her head and be-
gan to laugh and she laughed so long
and so loud that all the gang gathered
around to find out what was so funny

  oh joe says hazel to the wry-
neck pansy has made another mash
oswald says hed like to meet her

  of course the boys had the laugh
on me but shucks they was just as
anxious as i was to see her they be-
gan to yell

  pansy oh pansy we want
pansy and things like that
the chivalry of carbon county



   all right boys says the wryneck
til go in and coax her to come out
pansy aint very strong for the rough
stuff but i guess i can persuade her
and he climbed into the car

  he was gone quite some time we
bunched up around the car steps and
waited and while we were waiting we
made it up among ourselves to give her
three regular ring-tail peelers and a
tiger the minute she poked her nose out-
doors

  finally the door opened and there
was the wryneck

   gentlemen says he the young
lady was dressing or she w ouldnt have
kept you waiting allow me to present
to you miss pansy demarr the great-
est lady shortstop in the world

  he made a flourish with his arm like
a ringmaster in a circus and there was
pansy standing in the vestibule and
looking dowrn at us she had on what
looked like a long robe of some sort all
embroidery and lace and she smiled
when we gave her a real wyoming
send-off with a tiger that started the
dogs to barking for miles and miles

  speech speech yells charlie
patterson and we all took it up like a
lot of parrots

  pansy looked over at the wryneck
and he nodded at her she put one
hand up to her hair and the other one
went to her throat i could see that
she was fumbling with the catch to
that robe and just as i was beginning
to wonder what was coming off next
two things came off at once-pansys
head of hair and her dressing gown
she kicked the robe backward and
hopped down on the car steps-as

pretty looking a boy as ever you saw
in your life

  maybe youve heard the sound that
goes through a crowd at a prize fight
when one lad slips over a fluke knock-
out and takes everybody by surprise
including himself  a sort of a cross
between a grunt and a sigh ill bet
there wasnt enough wind left in the
whole lot of us to fetch out one decent
healthy  cuss word flabbergasted 
that aint no name for it and before
we could get breath enough to say any-
thing pansy made the speech wed been
asking for-made it in the kind of a
voice that goes with pants

   wheres that rube pitcher  says
he i want to give him a kiss  

  there was a long silence while bud
traced patterns in the gravel with his
boot heels

  at that he remarked defiantly i
wasnt fooled any worsen the rest of
em that kid could have fooled any-
body why he used to be on the stage
one of those female impersonators
but you know how it is in a small town
once they get anything on you they
never let go they just keep riding
you and riding you and i got sick of
it baldy sisson had everybody in car-
bon county calling me pansy i
couldnt stand that so i ducked but
if youve got a heart at all you wont

introducing his majesty

young captain michael oshea
shipmaster sat by a wtindow of
the jolly mermaid tavern at
blackwall on the thames be-
low london his companion johnny
kent was a stout red-faced gray-
headed man who had sailed the seas in
many kinds of steamers as chief engi-
neer these two leisurely drank mugs
of bitter beer and gazed with profes-
sional interest at the crowded shipping
of that great seaport thoroughfare
which sailormen call london river

   the jolly mermaid wras one of a jos-
tling row of ancient buildings with bow
windows and balconies painted in bright
 hues which overhung the tide at black-
wall to remind one of the maritime
london of towering frigates and high-
pooped galleons and stout seamen of
devon the near-by shore was filled
with shipyards and weedy wharves and
a little way downriver was the entrance
of the vast inland basin called the east
india docks where soared a wonder-
ful confusion of spars and rigging and

the red funnels of the union castle
liners lay side by side

  on the turbid river moved in pro-
cession a singular variety of craft-
drifting thames barges with dyed sails
square-riggers in tow norwegian
tramps half hidden beneath uncouth
deckloads of lumber rusty spanish
fruiters coastwise schooners spray-
stained steam trawlers from the dogger
bank stubby dutch eel-schuits stately
mail boats homeward bound from the
tropics sooty colliers from cardiff

  they slid past with an incessant din
of whistles which warning expostu-
lating shouted the rules of the road in
the language of the sea

  these familiar sights and sounds
pleased captain oshea and he was
contented with his seat by the window
of the jolly mermaid and the excellent
brew dispensed by the apple-cheeked
young woman behind the bar am-
phibious loafers drifted in and out or
cast anchor on the wharf alongside-
riggers watermen dock laborers sail-
ors who seemed to have a world of time
on their hands their gait was slouch-
ing their attire careless and their con-
the king and captain oshea



versation peppered with sanguinary
references to their eyes

   tis a restful place johnny and as
diverting as a theater observed
oshea

  the chief engineer returned rather
fretfully

  im willing to be idle in this bit of
slack water for a while and sort of
pull myself together capn mike but
this dont earn wages and i aint mak-
in much headway toward buy in that
farm down in the state o maine
whimsical amusement lighted
osheas bold smooth-shaven features
as he replied

  i am not a man to seek a humdrum
life afloat or ashore you impatient old
pirate there was a lot of fuss kicked
up at home about that last voyage of
ours as ye well know and there was
a strong chance that we would be laid
by the heels in one of uncle sams jails
for breaking the laws between nations
wre are better off where we are
governments are touchy but its
dog-goned foolishness to hold it against
us grumbled johnny kent we
were peacefully runnin a cargo of guns
and cartridges ashore for them rebel-
lious patriots in the caribbean and
most strictly mindin our own business
that spanish gunboat got in our way
and her intentions was plain blood-
thirsty what if we did ram her and
then blow her up she interfered with
men who were try in to make an honest
livin on the high seas

  argue as far as you like johnny
it wont alter the fact that it was
healthier for you and me to make our-
selves hard to find

  but its discouragin to look for an-
other ship here in england capn
mike we cant show board of trade
certificates were fish out of water
american masters and engineers pa-
pers are no good among these british-
ers

   tis not easy to find our kind of a
ship anywhere oshea reminded him
big risks and big wages is our game
there are no revolutions popping the
lid off in central or south america
and we will sit tight and trust in my

lucky star i have a gold piece or two
left in the toe of the sock where i
stowed it against times like this and
we have not sunk so low that we must
sign on for a lawful voyage in a ship
that does not dodge every smoke she
sights

  johnny kent crooked a finger at the
barmaid and sought consolation in an-
other mug of bitter while captain
oshea turned to a morning newspaper
and ran his eye down the ship-jews
column to note the arrivals and de-
partures then he cast a cursory
glance at the foreign dispatches which
might perchance disclose some disturb-
ance of the worlds peace and an op-
portunity for venturesome men used to
alarms and stratagems there was a
report of the seizure of a german
steamer for smuggling arms to a per-
sian gulf port oshea brightened
and decided to investigate the contra-
band trade of the persian gulf and as-
certain who was instigating it

  johnny kent was moved to begin an
aimless yarn about a certain wicked
skipper of yankee clipper fame who
fetched his second mate all the way
home from cape town doubled up in
a hencoop as a punishment for im-
pertinence it was one of those gar-
rulous interminable yarns which box
the compass without maintaining steer-
age way oshea listened politely but
with a manner slightly absent-minded
having heard the tale of the unfortu-
nate second mate and the hencoop in
at least five different ports

  the yarn was cut short and the two
men screwed around in their chairs to
stare at a visitor whose presence in the
humble longshore tavern of the jolly
mermaid was most extraordinary

  he was an elderly and very dignified
gentleman of a spare figure and the
stiffly erect carriage of an army officer
his features thin and rather refined
than forceful were given an air of dis-
tinction by a white mustache and im-
perial from the silk hat and frock
coat with the ribbon of an order in
the lapel to the tan gaiters and patent-
leather shoes he was dressed with fas-
tidious nicety in a club window of


the popular magazine

pall mall he would have been a con-
spicuous ornament in the dingy tap-
room of the jolly mermaid he was
startlingly incongruous

  the stranger had the grand manner
and it fitted him like a glove he was
not offensively self-important but one
knew him to be a personage who ex-
pected the world to show him defer-
ence the barmaid who was no dunce
at reading human nature bobbed a
curtsy and withheld the flippant per-
siflage which was wont to delight the
nautical patrons of the place

  a moment later there entered the
tavern a brisk young man with a sandy
complexion and a roving eye who
wras smartly but a trifle showily attired
-a keen up-to-snuff young man who
knew his way about with a respect-
ful bow he addressed the impressive
elderly gentleman

  i told him to meet us here if your
majesty pleases

  the apple-cheeked barmaid was
threatened with a fainting spell at the
intimation that royalty stood within the
tavern walls but rallied bravely to sug-
gest in a fluttered voice

  theres a tidy little back room your
royal ighness where you can set quiet
and privatelike without common folks
starin and gawkin at your worship
thanks i am rather tired after
tramping about the docks amiably re-
plied the personage in the pleasantly
modulated accents of the cultivated
englishman to the brisk young man
he said

  let us sit down and look over some
of the memoranda while we are wait-
ing

  certainly your majesty quoth the
young man and with this they passed
into the little back room and closed the
door a beefy dock laborer ripped out
an oath of amazement and clattered
from the bar to tell his friends that
one o them blighted weedin kings
wtas in the jolly mermaid large as life
so elp me

  that brace of exiled mariners cap-
tain oshea and johnny kent gazed
blankly at each other and being sea-
soned persons of wide experience tao

itly agreed to wait and try to fathom
the riddle they had dealt with presi-
dents of uneasy republics near the
equator and had violently interfered in
affairs of state but a real king to be
surveye at close range was a fascinat-
ing novelty

  johnny kent had carefully adjusted
his spectacles to his nose to survey this
rare spectacle and he now shoved them
up beyond his bushy brows before he
hoarsely confided to his comrade

  i thought they went about disguised
capn mike same as we run a block-
ade with no lights and the steamers
name boards covered up is he the real
king or is it just play actin

  europe is full of kings that have
been kicked out of their berths an-
swered oshea maybe this one is a
has-been but he doesnt look to me
like a counterfeit and i would not set
him down for a lunatic out for a stroll
with his keeper

  he handles himself as sane as you
or me agreed the chief engineer but
this is surely a dog-goned queer place
to find a stray king

   tis worth watching johnny im
on my beam ends for puzzlement

  ere long there appeared from the
street a bow-legged barrel-chested
hairy-fisted man with a rolling gait
whom a landlubber might have classi-
fied as a rough and hearty british sea-
man accustomed to command vessels
in the merchant trade a captious
critic would have perhaps surmised
that he had been pickled in rum as well
as in brine glancing at a card held
between a grimy thumb and finger he
asked the barmaid

  is baron frederick martin stroth-
ers hereabouts my girl captain
handys compliments

  if you mean the dashin young man
with the red weskit e is settin in yon-
der with his majesty

  right you are exclaimed captain
handy my business with his maj-
esty but the baron has charge of the
arrangements as minister of finance a
nipper of scotch whisky neat miss
before i talk to em

  what sort of a king is e and whats
the king and captain oshea



his bloomin handle she eagerly be-
sought him are you makin gyme of
me

  the hearty british shipmaster looked
inscrutable tossed the whisky into his
heated coppers and slowly assured her
womens curiosity is the fatal
weakness of the sex my dear a king
is a king wherever you find him and
my advice to you is not to go bragging
about and telling all hands that his
majesty has patronized the jolly mer-
maid

  he trudged to the rear room hat in
hand and timidly knocked on the door
as it opened the quick ear of captain
oshea heard the mysterious person-
age saying to the brisk young man

  a steamer of the tonnage of this
tyneshire glen is what i wish if your
investigation has satisfied you that she
is thoroughly seaworthy and in good
repair and captain handy also recom-
mends her-

  the door closed behind captain
handy and oshea glancing in that
direction smiled cynically and observed
to johnny kent

  did you size him up you know
the kind every big port has them-
broken shipmasters disrated mates
beach combers that arent fit to take a
scow to sea

  sure theyve borrowed money off
me from baltimore to singapore as
long as they can find a decent suit of
clothes and the price of a shave theyll
throw bluffs at anybody that will listen
to em this captain handy must have
sighted an easy mark in the offing
oshea pondered for a moment and
asked

  did ye hear mention of the tyne-
shire glen steamer just now do you
happen to know the vessel  i cant
place her

  johnny kent grunted as if he had sat
upon a tack and answered with heated
emphasis

  maybe its the old tyneshire glen
that was carryin cotton out of savan-
nah years ago i went aboard to see
her chief once and her plates was rust-
ed so thin that i could have thrown a
wrench through em

  captain handy had left the door of
the back room unlatched and a gusty
draft of sea breeze blew it partly open
the watchful pair in the taproom had
a glimpse of captain handy standing
stolidly between his majesty and the
minister of finance and heard him
huskily declaim

  the tyneshire glen is a bargain at
thirty thousand pounds-and you
neednt take my word for it baron
strothers here has interviewed the
brokers that have her for sale and he
knows the price they put on her and
they wont take a penny less

  i have full confidence in the judg-
ment of my minister of finance with
captain handys expert opinion to as-
sist him easily replied his majesty

  most of my papers were lost at
sea hastily put in captain handy as
if to forestall an awkward question
they were tied up in a packet your
royal ighness when the falls of clyde
steamer went down and i saved the
lives of forty-seven passengers and
was the last man to leave her when
she foundered under my feet the
newspapers praised me so that a mod-
est man ud blush to repeat it

  baron strothers has examined your
record so he informs me and advises
me that you are to be depended upon
was the warm assurance

  in the taproom oshea chuckled
skeptically and said to johnny kent

   tis likely enough he lost his pa-
pers but i mistrust his version of the
story what kind of a flimflam is this
anyhow  the king and the minister
of finance are discussing a rotten ship
and a rotten skipper as if the both of
them were to be taken seriously

after more conversation which the
listeners failed to catch the trio in the
back room ended the session and pre-
pared to leave the tavern as they
walked out past the bar captain handy
was arguing with awrkward gestures
the elderly personage was listening
courteously and the brisk young man
was alertly keeping an eye on both as
if he had an absorbing interest in the
interview in front of the tavern they
parted captain handy to turn in the


the vovulacr magazine

direction of the east india docks the
puzzling pair of notables to seek the
railroad station

  upon oshea and johnny kent there
fell a prolonged spell of silence each
was piecing theories together and dis-
carding them as unsatisfactory they
were uncommonly shrewd men of their
kind but in this instance conjecture
wras all adrift of one thing they were
convinced this royal visitation had
not been an elaborate hoax and the ex-
planation of lunacy was finally and em-
phatically dismissed

   tis no case of barnacles on the in-
tellect was the verdict of oshea
barring the fact that he ought to have
more sense than to listen to the palaver
of a rascal like this captain handy
why didnt we think to follow them
up and see where they went

  im too short-winded to make a
good sleuthhound capn mike and it
aint dignified for a man of my years
well then who is this captain
handy demanded oshea well
try another tack

  he questioned the barmaid who was
disappointing

  he never showed hisself in ere be-
fore said she youre more likely
to find out about im at the docks
say capn mike exclaimed
johnny kent with puckered brow
aint there some kind of a book writ-
ten about kings their habits and their
names and the various breeds of em
and where youre most apt to find em 
do they generally run around loose 
im not personally acquainted with
a whole lot of them johnny but as a
rule tis safe to bet they dont come
wandering into sailors taverns con-
voyed by the minister of finance

chapter ii

  a royal victim of land sharks

  next morning they carefully scruti-
nized the court circular of the lon-
don times and were more at sea than
ever at discovering that the only visit-
ing royalty comprised an unimportant
cousin of the house of hanover from

  a german duchy and the dusky ruler
of a native state of india that a full-
fledged king and a -minister of his cabi-
net both indubitably englishmen could
be strolling about london unnoticed by
the newspapers and unknown to the
public was fairly incredible and yet
no mention could anywhere be found of
the illustrious patrons of the jolly mer-
maid although oshea bought the
morning journals by the fistful for
the present they had to set aside the
episode as prodigiously odd and inex-
plicable

  oshea took it in his head to pay a
call at a ship brokers office down in
leadenhall street and johnny kent
rode with him on top of a bus they
had made the acquaintance of the man-
aging partner of the firm under the
palms of a venezuelan seaport and he
had cherished a strong friendship for
this pair of adventurous rovers he
was anxious to find a ship for oshea
and the latter dropped in now and then
in search of news

  the comrades twain were about to
dodge through the traffic of leaden-
hall street and enter the office of their
friend when oshea plucked johnny
kent by the sleeve and pulled him back
into an adjacent doorway a brisk
sandy-haired young man was also
doubling among the stream of vehicles
which roared from curb to curb and
aiming his course for the ship brokers
office

   tis the minister of finance
johnny cautiously spoke oshea
look at him there he goes right
into tavistock  huntleys the same
destination as ours

  why not go in and meet him
maybe george huntley will introduce
us and we can slip in a few questions

  because i do not like this sprightly
right bower of royalty johnny i took
a violent dislike to the baron frederick
martin strothers at first sight and
my hunches about people are worth
heeding when they take hold of me as
strong as this one did

  from their strategic place of obser-
vation they waited while oshea came
to the conclusion that the brisk young
the king and captain oshea



man would bear a deal of watching
flanking them and across the narrow
street were the offices of steamship
lines sailing to every part of the watery
globe the windows emblazoned with
the house flags and names of companies
familiar to the ports of the orient
australasia and south america this
stretch of old leadenhall street down
in the quaint labyrinthian city was
one of the cosmopolitan four corners
of civilization surely with all these
fleets of steamers whose business was
dispatched in the low gray buildings
there was one that needed as skilled
and resourceful men as captain oshea
and johnny kent these gentlemen of
fortune thought otherwise however
and took little interest in the companies
whose ships voyaged over the regular
orderly routes of traffic

  they surmised that the brisk young
man with the red waistcoat must have
business to transact with tavistock 
huntley for he remained inside for a
good half hour then  the watchers
caught no more than a farewell glimpse
of him as he hastily emerged and
popped into a passing hansom there-
upon they sauntered into the ship brok-
ers office and were cordially greeted
by george huntley managing partner
a stocky bald-headed person with mut-
ton-chop whiskers who looked as sub-
stantial as a brick house the spirit of
romance was in him however and he
secretly envied oshea his illogical pur-
suit of hazards for sheer love of them

  steering them into a small private
room he plumped himself into the chair
at the desk waved them to a leather-
covered lounge and inquired with
much gusto

 and how are my disreputable
friends this morning anything in the
wind

   tis still blowing a dead calm for
us but the weather is suspicious in one
quarter of the compass answered
oshea who was never one to beat
about the bush tell me george
what do you know about the young
man that just now whisked out of here
-the fancy lad with the loud vest and
the high-steppin manner if it is not

a

 meddling with your private affairs i
 should like to get a line on him
 huntley tilted his chair clasped his
 hands across a comfortable waistband
 and replied in his deliberate way

   i have laid eyes on him only twice
 his name is strothers i believe and he
 calls himself a baron one of those
 continental titles i fancy this day
 of last week he came into our place
 with captain handy who used to sail
 in the blue anchor service

   got in trouble with his owners
 didnt he interrupted oshea at a
 guess

  yes he lost a steamer in the bay
 of biscay and the evidence went to
 show that he was drunk at the time
 his certificate was taken away or sus-
 pended i forget the details he has
 had no ship since then a rather
 shabby lot is handy as i was about
 to tell you oshea the pair of them
 -captain handy and this spruce
 young man strothers-came in to ask
 our cash selling price for the tyne shire
 glen which is laid up in the east india
 docks we have no interest in the ves-
 sel beyond representing the owners
 who want to get rid of her

   and did you give the precious pair
 - of two-spots a price on her  blandly
 inquired oshea as pleased as a kitten
 with a saucer of cream he was fitting
 together a few pieces of the puzzle
 and felt confident that they were about
 to dovetail very neatly

   i offered them the tyneshire glen
 for twenty-four thousand pounds as
 she stands replied huntley its all
 shes worth she is a big steamer al-
 most five thousand tons but she will
 need a lot of repairs captain handy
 claimed that he had found a possible
 buyer in whose interests young stroth-
 ers was acting of course we were
 willing to pay handy a decent commis-
 sion if the deal went through

   oshea looked sidewise at johnny
 kent who on occasions was bright
 enough to see through a hole in a grind-
 stone they kept their thoughts to
 themselves and oshea commented
 noncommittally

   of course captain handy is entitled


the cpocpulacr magazine

to a commission if he finds you a cus-
tomer for the steamer george tis
an honest chance for the poor devil to
pick up a few dollars and so the
young man-strothers-came back this
morning do i show too much cu-
riosity in asking what he had to say
you are welcome to all i know he
told m that the gentleman whose inter-
ests he represented had inspected the
tyneshire glen yesterday and thought
she would answer his purpose the
price was satisfactory and he would
like a three days option which i was
very willing to give him

  and the price was still twenty-four
thousand pounds  violently put in
johnny kent with a snort as if his
steam were rising

  precisely twenty-four thousand
pounds or one hundred and twenty
thousand dollars of your yankee cur-
rency or thereabouts are you think-
ing of buying her yourself johnny
said huntley with a broad smile

  god forbid was the fervent re-
sponse id be afraid to sneeze on
board of her in the docks for fear her
rivets would fly ofif

  oh she isnt as bad as all that a
well-built steamer is the tyneshire
glen with lots of service in her
what she needs is a new hull boil-
ers and engines grunted johnny
say george huntley did this young
man strothers mention anything about
buyin the steamer for a king that is
roamin around london without any

tag to him-

  a king ejaculated the ship broker
blinking like an astonished owl are
you chaps ragging me

  no maybe the joke is on us or
else this english bitter beer aint agree-
in with us and capn mike and me
have been seein visions and hearin
things that aint so

  huntley cast an appealing glance at
oshea who said

   tis evident that you are not ac-
quainted with our particular king
george you do not move in royal
circles you are not in our class we
will tell you about it later about this

young man that calls himself a baron
-did he leave any address behind
him 

  yes he is staying at the carleton
but i shall have no occasion to com-
municate with him if the option ex-
pires i shall take it for granted that
he doesnt want the steamer if he
pays down the cash i shall be ready to
make out the papers and give captain
handy his commission now you
ought to tell me why you are so keen
on knowing all about the business if
you refuse to explain you are a worth-
less pair of blighters and no friends of
mine

  oshea hauled johnny kent to his
feet and remarked

  we thank you kindly george you
are a good-natured man and we have
made nuisances of ourselves tis the
honest truth that we know very little
more about this young man and the
tyneshire glen than ye know yourself
but what we do know we will first in-
vestigate

  you are conspirators born and
bred laughed huntley rather pleased
to have what seemed an ordinary busi-
ness transaction wrapped in romantic
mystery come and dine with me as
soon as you have unraveled the plot

  they agreed to this and straightway
betook themselves to the nearest pub-
lic house where in a quiet corner a
council of war was convened lengthy
exposition of the facts was unneces-
sary it was obvious that they had run
athwart a scheme to defraud the con-
fiding purchaser of the tyneshire glen
and their sympathies went out strong-
ly to the royal victim whether or not
he was a real king was beside the mark
he was very much the gentleman and
he had trusted too much in the loyalty
and integrity of that enterprising young
man who was called the minister of
finance

   tis as plain as the big nose on that
red face of yours johnny exclaimed
oshea the two crooks are standing
in together captain handy recom-
mends the ship as all right this baron
frederick martin strothers backs him
up and advised his majesty to buy her
the king and captain oshea



the two blackguards get a price of
twenty-four thousand pounds from
george huntley and they tell this in-
nocent potentate that the price is thirty
thousand pounds the difference is six
thousand pounds thirty thousand dol-
lars which this pair of land sharks
will split up and stick in their own
pockets and they will doctor the bill
of sale so the poor deluded monarch
will never know what happened to
him

  that was what we heard em say in
the jolly mermaid capn mike the
price was thirty thousand pounds and
these britishers call us a nation of yan-
kee grafters

   tis my opinion that a minister of
finance like this one could bankrupt a
kingdom give him time enough said
oshea he is working the game for
all its worth he will loot the treas-
ury as long as it looks safe and easy
and then he will resign his what-do-ye-
call-it-his portfolio-and leave his
bunkoed majesty to figure out the defi-
cit

  that poor king deserves to be de-
livered from his lovin friends replied
johnny kent or hell have to hock the
crown jewels to pay for his board and
washin whats the orders now 
we will ring up full speed ahead
and find this king if the minister
of finance is at the carleton hotel tis
a good bet that his majesty is not far
away that busy young man will not
separate himself from a good thing

chapter iii

the baron intervenes

  the fashionable carleton was unfa-
miliar territory to the inquisitive mari-
ners but they strolled boldly through
the corridors until they fetched tip in
front of a desk presided over by an
immaculate clerk with a languid man-
ner who coldly regarded them and ap-
peared indifferent to their wants
after waiting for several minutes for
some recognition captain michael
oshea sweetly remarked

  will ye answer a civil question or

will i climb over the counter and jolt
you wtide awake

  the languid person looked attentive-
ly at the resolute features and master-
ful eye of the speaker and hastily re-
sponded 

  beg pardon-beg pardon-what can
i do for you sir

  tell me if a king is stopping in this
hotel of yours and does he have a min-
ister of finance called baron stroth-
ers 

  ah you mean his majesty king os-
mond of trinadaro and the clerk
delivered these resounding syllables
with unction yes he is a guest of
the hotel

  he is a real one-do you get that 
soberly whispered oshea to his com-
rade before he again addressed the
clerk

  we wish to see him on important
business we will write our names on
a card

  baron strothers receives such call-
ers as are personally unknown to his
majesty the clerk explained

  we dont wish to see the young
man said oshea

  my orders are to send all cards and
messages to him

  the two visitors drew apart from
the desk and put their heads together

  the minister of finance will not let
us get within a cables length of his
boss if he thinks we are seafaring
men whispered oshea

  the swindler may have took notice
of us in the jolly mermaid growled
johnny kent we might send up a
card and make headway as far as this
strothers person then i could knock
him down and sit on his head while
you rummaged the royal apartments
and foundthe king

  your methods might strike these
hotel people as violent johnny youre
a good man at sea but i would not call
ye a diplomat anyhow we will take
a chance on running the blockade that
this crooked minister of finance has
established to prevent honest men from
talking to his employer

  returning to the desk oshea picked
up a pen and wrote on a blank card


the popular magazine

  captain michael oshea and john kent
esq u s a to see king osmond on a
matter that he will rind interesting

  promptly in answer to this message
came word that baron strothers would
see the gentlemen a hotel attendant
conducted them to a suite of rooms on
the second floor which must have cost
the royal treasury a pretty penny at
the threshold of a sort of anteroom
they were met by the brisk self-pos-
sessed young man who gazed sharply
at the sturdy sunburned strangers hes-
itated a trifle and invited them to en-
ter offering them cigars he bade
them be seated and again scrutinized
them as if striving to recall where he
might have seen them before

  captain oshea at his ease in any
company or circumstances and particu-
larly now when he held the whip hand
asked at once

  are we to have the pleasure of pay-
ing our respects to his majesty

  you americans are so jolly infor-
mal smiled the minister of finance
this sort of thing is done only by
special appointment an audience is
arranged beforehand if i consider it
worth while

  but this king of yours takes a spe-
cial interest in ships and sailors sug-
gested oshea and we have infor-
mation that he will find useful

  baron frederick martin strothers
changed color just a trifle and his man-
ner was perceptibly uneasy as he ex-
plained 

  i am awfully sorry but he is not
in at present he will be disappointed
im sure you are shipmasters or
something of the sort i take it

  you guess right was the dry com-
ment of oshea i have heard that
you are fond of talking to seafaring
men yourself

  the shot went home the young
man moved in his chair and looked
painfully uncomfortable nervously
twisting a cigar in his fingers he re-
plied 

ah yes now i know you must
have seen me at the east india docks
there or thereabouts but no mat-
ter said oshea his majesty is not

in you say and when will he be in
the hotel again

  not for several hours i fancy he
went out with the minister of foreign
affairs to keep an important appoint-
ment will you state your business to
me that is the customary procedure
you know

  johnny kent was for denouncing the
young man to his face in a vocabulary
well stored with brimstone but oshea
nudged him and smoothly made an-
swer 

  it would please us better to see the
king himself we will come again or
we can look for him on his way in and
out of the hotel

  the young man could not dissemble
signs of impatience to be rid of these
pertinacious intruders

  if you have a ship to sell or you
are looking for positions this is only
wasting time said he i presume
you heard something of our errand
among the docks

  yes we have heard of it and
oshea bit off the words well
johnny shall we go below and wait till
his majesty heaves in sight this min-
ister of finance will give us no satis-
faction and i am not used to dealing
with understrappers

  you are impertinent cried the
young man i have been as courteous
as possible you will leave at once
or i shall ask the hotel management to
put you out

  up from a chair rose the massive
bulk of johnny kent and his ample
countenance was truculent as he roared
in a voice like a gale of wind

  youll throw us out you pin-headed
half-baked impudent son of a sea
cook  no capn mike i wont shut
up i aint built that way diplomacy
be dog-goned im liable to lose my
temper

   tis a large-sized temper to lose
and i hereby hoist storm signals said
oshea with a grin as he neatly tripped
the minister of finance who was en-
deavoring to reach an electric push but-
ton and summon the police

  the fervid declamation of johnny
kent must have echoed through the
the king an captain oshea

ioi

apartments it sufficed to attract the
notice of a spare erect elderly gentle-
man in another room who opened a
door and stared curiously at the stren-
uous tableau at sight of the kindly
refined face with the snowy mustache
and imperial oshea gleefully shouted
the king-god bless him so this
bright young minister of finance was
a liar as well as a thief

  comically abashed johnny kent
mumbled an apology for making such
an uproar at which the elderly gentle-
man bowed acknowledgment and said
to the perturbed and rumpled stroth-
ers 

  my dear baron will you be good
enough to explain

  these ruffians insisted on seeing
you and when i tried to discover their
business they called me names and as-
saulted me sputtered the young man
in a heat of virtuous indignation i
was about to have them ejected

  he was afraid of the truth cried
oshea we came to tell your majesty
that he has cooked up a job to cheat
ye out of six thousand pounds and
we can prove it up to the hilt we
caught him with the goods

  that sounds a whole lot better to me
than diplomacy approvingly exclaimed
johnny kent

  bewildered by the vehemence of
these outspoken visitors king osmond
i of trinadaro turned to the sullen
minister of finance and inquired still
with his sweet kindliness of manner
these men do not look like ruffians
my dear baron they impress me as
having more than ordinary intelligence
and force of character wrhat are their
names and who are they  and what
is the meaning of this grave charge
they bring against your integrity

  i am oshea shipmaster hailing
from the port of new york spoke
up the one

  i am johnny kent chief engineer
to captain mike oshea said the
other and i hail from the state o
maine and we can show you our
papers ive didnt lose em in the bay
of biscay

  strothers stood biting his nails and

shifting from one foot to the other
for once stripped of his adroit plausible
demeanor hor could he find on the
spur of the moment the right word to
say the royal personage said it for
him

  i think you had better retire i
wish to hear what captain oshea and
mr kent may have to say to me

  the amiable monarch was uncon-
sciously swayed by the virile personal-
ity of oshea who dominated the scene
as if he wtere on the deck of his own
ship

  baron frederick martin strothers
made a last attempt to protest but
johnny kent glared at him so wickedly
and oshea moved a step nearer writh
so icy a glint in his gray eye that there
was a moment later a vanished minis-
ter of finance

chapter iv

opening the kings eyes

  the etiquette of courts troubled
oshea not in the least as he cheerily
yet respectfully suggested to the per-
plexed elderly gentleman

  now king osmond if you will
please sit down and let us talk things
over with ye as man to man well tell
you how it happened

  the personage obediently did as he
was told nor could he feel offended by
the shipmasters boyish candor oshea
chewed on his cigar and his eyes twin-
kled as he glanced at the stubborn vis-
age of johnny kent which was still
flushed and stormy his majesty began
to get his wits together and to wonder
why he had permitted this brace of
total strangers to take him by storm
oshea broke into his cogitations by
explaining

  you are surprised that you chucked
thff trusted minister of finance out of
the room and consented to listen to us
at all in the first place we are not
asking anything of you wrhat i mean
is we felt bound to put you next to
the dirty deal that was framed up to
rob ye

  we saw you in the jolly mermaid


the popular magazine

tavern and we liked your looks in-
genuously added johnny kent we
decided to do you a good turn whether
we ever saw the color of your money
or not

  and we didnt like the cut of the
jib of your minister of finance re-
sumed oshea and we were dead
sure that captain handy was rotten
king osmond earnestly interrupted
but i have had all the confidence in
the world in baron strothers and as
a british sailor of the tarry breed cap-
tain handy-

  the two of them are tarred with
the same brush exclaimed oshea
they fixed it up between them to pay
twenty-four thousand pounds for the
tyneshire glen and sell her to you for
thirty thousand tis a simple matter
to produce the evidence send a mes-
senger to tavistock  huntley in
leadenhall street the magging part-
ner will be glad to come here at once
he named the price to captain handy
and your precious minister of finance
tis a clear case

  you can buy her yourself from
george huntley and hell be darn glad
to get his price chimed in johnny
kent that ought to prove it but
if youll listen to me youll have noth-
in to do with the tyneshire glen
the faith of king osmond in hu-
man nature had been severely jarred
but somehow he could not doubt the
statements of these headstrong rugged
men who drove their words home as
with a sledge hammer toward the
graceless minister of finance he felt
more sorrow than anger as he wove
together in his mind this and that cir-
cumstance of previous transactions
which should have made him more vigi-
lant but the culprit was the son of
a dear friend and his credentials had
been impeccable the king had become
fond of him

  i shall obtain from tavistock 
huntley confirmation of your story as
you suggest he slowly replied to
oshea in the meantime i wish you
would tell me about yourselves

  wre are looking for big risks and

big wages said oshea with a smile
johnny kent and i are better known
in the ports of the spanish main than
in london river we have made voy-
ages to haiti and honduras and cuba
without the consent of the lawful gov-
ernments and we know our trade

  king osmond reflectively stroked his
white imperial and his face assumed
an expression of vivid interest these
men were different from captain
handy they would neither cringe nor
lie to him and they looked him squarely
between the eyes he desired to draw
them out to let them talk at their lei-
sure

  will you be good enough to come
into my own rooms said he we
shall find more privacy and comfort
i should like to hear of your adventures
along the spanish main

  with a courteous gesture he showed
them into a much larger and more luxu-
rious room which was furnished and
used as a library or private office inas-
much as a large flat-topped desk was
strewn with books pamphlets and doc-
uments and many more of them were
piled on tables and on shelves against
the walls as a temporary headquar-
ters for royalty at work the room sug-
gested industry and the administration
of large affairs

  so friendly and unconventional was
the reception granted them that cap-
tain oshea and johnny kent were
made to feel that their intrusion de-
manded no more explanations or apol-
ogies their curiosity fairly tormented
them it was on the tips of their
tongues to ask the host what kind of
a kingdom was his and where it was
situated but this would be rudeness
oshea took note of several admiralty
charts on the desk two of them un-
rolled with the corners pinned down
and a rule and dividers for measuring
distances

  king osmond sympathetic and tact-
ful encouraged oshea to spin the yarn
of his latest voyage-of a contraband
cargo of arms a steamer that fought
her way clear of the enemy and all
but foundered before she was beached
and abandoned on a lonely coral key
the king and captain oshea



  while oshea was telling the story
johnny kent let his eyes wander to a
small table at his elbow it was cov-
ered with magazines government re-
ports and newspaper clippings one
of the latter was so placed that he
could read it from where he sat and
with absorbed interest he perused the
following paragraphs

  colonel osmond george sydenham-leach
of the ancient norfolk family has lived on
the continent for the last dozen years and
is better known to the boulevards of paris
than to london  he was never considered
eccentric until quite recently when his claim
to the island of trinadaro in the south
atlantic as a sovereign realm aroused much
interest and amusement he has assumed
the title of king osmond i

  it is said that he has created an order of
nobility and that the insignia of the grand
cross of trinadaro has been bestowed upon
the fortunate gentlemen comprising his cabi-
net and circle of advisers a court circu-
lar is expected to appear shortly and a diplo-
matic service will be organized

  until his majesty is ready to sail for trina-
daro to occupy his principality the royal en-
tourage will be found in the state apartments
of the hotel carleton elaborate prepara-
tions are in progress for colonizing the island
of trinadaro and a shipload of people and
material will leave london in a few weeks

  king osmond the first has a very large
fortune he is unmarried and his estates
at his death will pass to the children of his
only brother sir wilfred sydenham-leach
of haselton-on-trent the kinfolk of his
majesty are alarmed so it is reliably reported
lest his wealth will be squandered on this
curiously medieval conception of setting up
an independent principality upon an unpro-
ductive volcanic island in mid-ocean which
no nation has taken the trouble to annex

  slowly and carefully johnny kent
waded through this information with
never a flicker of a smile his face
was enjoyably absorbed the solution
of the mystery of king osmond i im-
pressed him as neither grotesque nor
curiously medieval the blustering
simple-hearted chief engineer was in
his own way a dreamer of dreams a
follower of visions although he as-
sumed that he had linked himself with
the troubled fortunes of captain mike
oshea merely for the sake of double
wages and a bonus at the end of the
voyage in all london the king of
trinadaro could not have found two

men of readier mind to fall in with his
project and his pretensions than these
to play at being a king on a desert
island to have the means to make it
all come true-why thought johnny
kent and he knew oshea would in-
stantly agree with him every living
man with the spirit of youth in him
would jump at the chance

  he was anxious to pass the tidings
on to oshea and when the conver-
sation slackened he edged in with an
excited flourish of his fist

  we must be on our way capn
mike his majesty is good-hearted to
listen to us but it aint polite to talk
his ear off

  with this speech went so eloquent
a wink that oshea comprehended that
the engineer had something up his
sleeve their host cordially declared
that he must see them again and made
an appointment for ten oclock of the
next forenoon they took their de-
parture after friendly farewells and
steered a course for blackwall and the
haven of the jolly mermaid

  oshea was as delighted as a boy to
learn that king osmond was about to
found an island kingdom it was a
more attractive revelation thati if he
had been discovered to be the inconse-
quential ruler of some effete little do-
main of europe and if one planned
to set himself up in business as a
sovereign it was proper to use all the
pomp and trappings and ceremony that
belonged with the game oshea was
heart and soul in sympathy with the
dreams and plans of the gentle elderly
eccentric who had the imagination to
play the part with scrupulous attention
to detail

  if he is to have a navy cried
oshea as he pounded his comrade on
the back i know where he can find
an admiral and a fleet engineer

  not so fast capn mike i have
a notion that hell have his own trou-
bles gettin to his kingdom any man
that can be bunkoed as easy as he was
is liable to have all his playthings took
away from him before he has a chance
to use em ill feel safer about him
when he gets clear of london river

the potential lawbreaker

  before seeking the royal audience
next morning they went to leadenhall
street to see george huntley the ship
broker greeted them indignantly

  you would try to hoodwink me
would you  exclaimed he i have
found out who your mysterious king
is i received a letter from him last
night asking information about the
price of the tyneshire glen by jove
i had no idea it was this crazy colonel
sydenham-leach who calls himself
ruler of trinadaro

  own up like a man george shout-
ed oshea you would like nothing
better than to be this kind of a king
yourself

  the stolid-looking ship broker
laughed and confessed

  you have read my thoughts like a
wizard it would be a jolly lark-
what but confound you you have
spoiled the sale of a steamer for me
how about that 

  weve tried to keep an estimable
king from going to davy jones locker
in a floating coffin that ye call the tyne-
shire glen severely retorted oshea
if he will sign us on as councilors we
will find him a real ship and we will
recommend him to deal with you have
ye any steamers that will pass honest
mens inspection

  plenty of them promptly answered
huntley

  then we will look at two or three
of them after we have paid our re-
spects to his majesty well not let
him be cheated out of his eyeteeth we
have decided to protect him he be-
longs to us isnt that so johnny
he needs us bad capn mike
huntley became serious and took
them into the rear office before he con-
fided 

  i dont-know im sure whether you
chaps are joking or not however here
is a bit of news for you on the quiet
i met a friend of mine-a barrister-
yesterday we had luncheon at the
cheshire cheese and something or
other set him to talking about this

sydenham-leach affair it seems that
the lawyers are quite keen about it
the family relations are planning to
kick up a devil of a row to bring pro-
ceedings under the lunacy act and pre-
vent this king osmond from sailing
off to his silly island of trinadaro
they hate to see a fortune thrown
away in this mad enterprise as they
call it

  oshea was righteously wrathful as
he flung out

  the mean-spirited meddlesome
skunks would they interfere with a
gentleman and his diversions hasnt
he a right to spend his money as he
pleases have ye ever seen him
george he is a grand man to meet
and tis proud we are to be his friends

  oh i fancy they will have a job
to prove he is insane said huntley
but they may make a pot of trouble
for him

  i suppose they can pester him with
all kinds of legal foolishness and haul
him before the courts and so on
agreed oshea it would break his
heart and spoil all his fun tis an
outrageous shame george what is
the system in this country when they
want to investigate a mans top story

  i asked the barrister chap replied
huntley the friends of the person
suspected of being dotty-generally the
near relatives-lay the case before one
of the judges in lunacy and he orders
an inquiry which is held before one
of the masters in lunacy then if the
alleged lunatic demands a trial by jury
he gets it if he cant convince them
that he is sound in the thinker then
his estate is put in charge of a com-
mittee duly appointed by law

  oshea listened glumly and glowered
his intense displeasure if the law
could interfere with a man who wished
to be a king on an island which no-
body else wanted then the law was all
wrong

  and these indecent relatives who
want his money will wtait and spring a
surprise on him said the aggrieved
shipmaster they will take his ship
away from him and knock all his beau-
tiful schemes into a cocked hat
the king and captain oshea



  i imagine he would not be allowed
to leave england if the proceedings
were started said huntley

  johnny kent who had been darkly
meditating aroused himself to shout
explosively

  well get him to sea in his ship
whenever he wants to sail and the
relatives and the judges and the mas-
ters in lunacy be darned it aint the
first time that you and me have broken
laws in a good cause capn mike
you come along with us george hunt-
ley were on our way to have a con-
fab with his majesty and maybe you
can do some business with him right
off the reel he ought to load his ship
and head for blue water as quick as
the lord will let him if hes a luna-
tic then the most of us is queer
without bragging about ourselves
i guess we can take his majesty to sea
whenever he wants to go quoth cap-
tain oshea

chapter vi

a regular yankee trick

  behold then that pair of exiled yan-
kee mariners captain michael oshea
and johnny kent stanchly enlisted on
the side of king osmond i of trina-
daro against the designs of all who
would thwart his gorgeous and imprac-
ticable purposes that his rank and
title were self-assumed and his realm
as yet unpeopled impressed these in-
genuous sailormen as neither shadowy
hor absurd their services were at his
disposal they would cheerfully face
iny risks and obstacles to make that
distant island in the south atlantic
ivhat oshea called all shipshape and
ready for the king business

  once they had gained the royal ear
it was a matter of course that they
should win the royal confidence king
osmond i was an elderly gentleman
of a singularly guileless disposition and
the notoriety attending his unique proj-
ect had caused him to be surrounded
by persons who knew precisely what
they wanted of these the vanished
minister of finance baron frederick

martin strothers of the brisk de-
meanor and the red waistcoat had been
a conspicuous example

  it was really a rare piece of good
fortune for the amiable monarch that
there should have come to his aid two
such hard-headed and honest adven-
turers as oshea and johnny kent
their advice concerning things nauti-
cal was eminently sound besides
which they were apt to prove a match
for the attempts of the relatives of
king osmond formerly known as
colonel sydenham-leach to prevent
him from sailing away to his distant
principality

  the result of several conversations
was that oshea and johnny kent were
engaged to select a steamer for pur-
chase and to take charge of her for the
voyage to trinadaro their qualifica-
tions were warmly indorsed by the
well-known ship-broking firm of tavi-
stock  huntley of leadenhall street
the managing partner george hunt-
ley that solid man with the mutton-
chop whiskers and the romantic tem-
perament was delighted with the ar-
rangement and took a boyish interest
in every detail of the picturesque enter-
prise it would have been a temptation
not easy to resist if king osmond had
offered him the place of minister of
marine with the bestowal of the in-
signia of the grand cross of trina-
daro

  the august personage was prodigi-
ously busy several secretaries and ste-
nographers toiled like mad to handle
the vast amount of clerical work and
correspondence to establish a ready-
made kingdom from the ground up is
no small task the king planned to
carry with him a sort of vanguard of
subjects or colonists who were to erect
buildings set up machinery till the soil
prospect for mineral wealth and other-
wise lay the foundations of empire
these pioneers were largely recruited
from his own estates and villages in
norfolk and formed a sturdy company
of british yeomanry

  concerning the natural advantages
and resources of trinadaro as a the-
ater for this drama of royal ambitions


the popular magazine

and activities the king and captain mi-
chael oshea became involved in ear-
nest argument the shipmaster was
never one to- smother his opinions from
motives of flattery or self-interest and
what information about trinadaro he
had been about to pick up on his own
account was not dyed in glowing col-
ors

  i have not seen the island meself
your majesty said he but the sail-
ing directions set it down as mostly
tall rocks with a difficult landing place
and a dense population of hungry land
crabs as big as your hat and if it
was any good would not some one of
these benevolent powers have gobbled
it up long ago

  king osmond appeared untroubled
and to such objections as this he pleas-
antly made answer 

  several years ago i made a long
voyage in a sailing ship  account of
my health captain oshea and we
touched at trinadaro to get turtles and
fresh water it was then that i con-
ceived the idea of taking possession of
the island as an independent principal-
ity although it has a most forbidding
aspect from seaward there is an inland
plateau fit for cultivation and settle-
ment it contains the ruined stone
walls of an ancient town founded by
the early portuguese navigators and
it is well to remember concluded the
monarch of trinadaro with a whimsi-
cal smile that available domains are
so scarce that one should not be too
particular trinadaro appears to have
been overlooked

   tis the rule thatthe christian na-
tions will steal any territory that isnt
nailed down was the dubious com-
ment of oshea they must have a
poor opinion of trinadaro but as ye
say tis about the only chance thats
left for a king to work at his trade
with a brand-new sign over the door
johnny kent spent most of his time
downriver among the london docks
wherever seagoing steamers were for
sale or charter his bulky figure might
have been seen trudging from deck to
engine room george huntley showed
him the best vessels the firm had to

offer but the gray-haired mariner was
bound to do his own investigating ex-
plaining with brutal candor tc the
friendly ship broker

  youre a nice man george and im
fond of you but you aint sellin ships
for your health and you cant help bein
a mite prejudiced in your own favor

  at length with the royal approval
oshea had-the purchase papers made
out for the fine steamer tarlington
which was berthed in a basin of the
east india docks she was a modern
well-equipped freighter of four thou-
sand tons which had been in the aus-
tralian trade and could be fitted for sea
at a few days notice the transfer
of ownership was given no needless
publicity george huntley attended to
that he had another interview with
his friend the barrister who hinted at
forthcoming events which gravely
threatened the peace and welfare of
osmond i the kingdom of trinadaro
and the ship in which the ruler his
court his colonists and his cargo were
to sail

  oshea and johnny kent discussed
this latest information at supper in the
jolly mermaid tavern with a platter
of fried sole between them

  tis this way explained oshea
there is no doubt at all that this grand
kijjg of ours will figure in the lunacy
proceedings that we heard was in the
wind his relatives are getting greed-
ier and more worried every day and
until the matter is decided one way or
another they will use every means the
law allows to head him off from spend-
ing the good money that belongs to
him

  and how can they stop him from
scatterin his coin for these wise and
benevolent purposes of his demanded
the engineer

  well george huntley says the law
will permit them to clap some kind of
a restraining order on the ship and
hold her in the dock with the judges
officers aboard till the proceedings are
over and they can serve the same
kind of documents on king osmond to
prevent his chasing himself beyond the
jurisdiction of the court says george
the king and captain oshea



  but all this infernal shindy cant be
started unless theres proof positive
that his majesty intends to fly the coop
capn mike

  right you are johnny you old sea
lawyer they cant bother the king
until he is actually on board and the
ship is cleared so the barrister lad tells
george

  then theyll be watchin the tar-
ling ton like terriers at a rat hole ex-
claimed the engineer

  no they wont cried oshea with
tremendous earnestness about once
in so often i have a bright idea johnny
one of them has just now hit me be-
tween the eyes do ye mind how we
slipped out of charleston harbor in the
hercules steamer bound on the fili-
busterin expedition to honduras 
twas a successful stratagem and it
could be done in london river

  sure it could and johnny kent
chuckled joyously and the king
neednt know anything about it

  of course we will keep it from him
if we can agreed oshea i will do
anything short of murder to keep him
happy and undisturbed and it would
upset him terribly to know that he must
be smuggled out of england to dodge
the rascals that would keep him at
home as a suspected lunatic

 wed better put george huntley
next to this proposition of ours sug-
gested johnny he itches to he a red-
handed conspirator

  the ship broker admired the scheme
when it was explained to him yes the
old tyneshire glen which they had so
scornfully declined to purchase was
still at her moorings and they were
welcome to use her as a dummy or de-
coy or whatever one might choose to
call it oshea could pretend to load
her he could send as many people on
board as he liked and put a gang of
mechanics at work all over the bally old
hooker said huntley if the enemies
of king osmond took it for granted
that the tyneshire glen was the ship
selected to carry him off to trinadaro
that was their own lookout it was a
ripping good joke and a regular yan-
kee trick by jove

chapter vii

planning a colossal farce

  oshea and johnny kent took great
care to avoid being seen in the vicinity
of the tarlington such inspection and
supervision as were necessary they con-
trived to attend to after dark the
king was up to his ears in urgent busi-
ness and was easily persuaded to leave
the whole conduct of the ships affairs
in their capable hands and to waive
preliminary visits to the east india
docks

  oshea employed a scotch engineer
-who wasted no words and understood
that his wages depended on his taci-
turnity-to oversee such repair work
as the tarlington needed and to keep
steam in the donkey boilers

  all signs indicated that the tarling-
ton was preparing for one of her cus-
tomary voyages to australia soon the
cargo began to stream into her hatches
the ostensible destinations of the truck-
loads of cases and crates and bales of
merchandise were sydney melbourne
wellington freemantle and so on
one might read the names of the con-
signees neatly stenciled on every pack-
age this was done under the eye of
captain oshea who in his time had
loaded hundreds of boxes of rifles and
cartridges innocently labeled con-
densed milk prime virginia hams
and farming tools

  but the place to find roaring osten-
tatious activity was on board the old
tyneshire glen captain oshea vis-
ited her daily and johnny kent hus-
tled an engine-room crew with loud
and bitter words it appeared as if
the ship was in a great hurry to go
to sea while oshea was stirring up
as much pretended industry as possi-
ble the question of a cargo was not
overlooked it was shoved on board
as fast as the longshoremen in the holds
could handle it nor did these brawny
toilers know that all these stout wooden
boxes so plainly marked and consigned
to trinadaro via s s tyneshire glen
contained only bricks sand stones and
scrap iron

  they were part of the theatrical


the popular magazine

properties of captain oshea who
could readily produce a make-believe
cargo for a faked voyage in a steamer
which had no intention of leaving port

  the london newspapers showed
fresh interest in the schemes and
dreams of king osmond i of trina-
daro the tyneshire glen was visited
by inquisitive journalists with note-
books and cameras captain oshea
welcomed them right courteously and
gave them information cigars and ex-
cellent whisky they returned to their
several offices to write breezy columns
about the preparations for the singular
voyage in the tyneshire glen so se-
vere are the english libel laws that
never a hint was printed of the possi-
ble legal obstacles which might bring
the enterprise to naught for purposes
of publication king osmond was as
sane as a trivet unless a judge and jury
should officially declare him ptlierwise

  nevertheless the intimation had
reached the newspaper offices that the
relatives of colonel sydenham-leach
were likely to take steps to prevent him
from leaving england and reporters
were assigned to watch the tyneshire
glen up to the very moment of depar-
ture

  now and then johnny kent quietly
trundled himself on board the tarling-
ton and was gratified to find that prog-
ress was running smoothly in all de-
partments so nearly ready for sea
was the big cargo boat that the time
had come to devise the final details of
the stratagem

  accordingly captain oshea went
boldly to the customhouse and took out
clearance papers not for the tarlington
to australia but for the tyneshire
glen to the island of trinadaro the
chief officer whom he had selected to
go with him held a masters certificate
and the ship was cleared in his name

  as for the tarlington which was
really to sail while the tyneshire glen
remained peacefully at her moorings in
the east india docks oshea decided
to omit the formality of clearances as
he explained it to johnny kent

  the less attention that is called to
the tarlington the better once at sea

we will hoist the flag of trinadaro over
our ship and his majestys government
will give her a registry and us our cer-
tificates tis handy to be an independ-
ent sovereign with a merchant marine
of his own

  the services of an employment
agency enabled oshea to muster sev-
eral score bogus colonists or subjects
of king osmond persons of respect-
able appearance who were glad to earn
ten shillings apiece by marching on
board the tyneshire glen with bags and
bundles in their hands there could
be no room for doubt in the public mind
that the eccentric grandiose colonel
sydenham-leach was on the point of
leaving his native shores with his peo-
ple and material for founding his island
principality

  it seemed advisable to captain
oshea to take the tarlington out of
the docks late in the afternoon swing
into the river and anchor until king
osmond should be brought aboard in a
tug furnished by george huntley
there was much less risk of observa-
tion in having the royal passenger join
the ship after nightfall and away from
the populous docks in addition to wthich
oshea preferred to get clear of the
cramping stone basins and gates and
hoffl his ship in the fairway with room
for a speedy departure in the event of
a stern chase

  he artlessly explained to the king
that this arrangement would allow his
majesty to spend several more hours
ashore in winding up his many final de-
tails of business and he would avoid
the tedious delay of warping the
steamer out of the docks the plaus-
ible shipmaster also made it clear that
sailing at night would enable him to
catch the turn of the tide and find high
water over the shoal places in the chan-
nel

  the unsuspecting monarch approved
these plans and had no idea that they
were part of an elaborate conspiracy
to smuggle him out of england under
cover of darkness because the authori-
ties intended to detain him as one
whose sanity must be investigated

  as a final device to throw the enemy
the king and captain oshea



off the scent oshea conceived what
he viewed as a master stroke george
huntley was called into consultation
and promptly sent for a superannuated
clerk of his office staff who had been
pensioned after many years of faithful
service he proved to be a slender
white-haired man who carried himself
with a great deal of dignity and at the
first glimpse of him oshea exclaimed
delightedly

  you couldnt have done better
george if you had raked london with
a comb put a snowy mustache and
chin whisker  him and he will pass
for king osmond of trinadaro with
no trouble at all

  i think we can turn him into a
pretty fair counterfeit grinned hunt-
ley and when he walks aboard the
tyneshire glen at dusk by jove and
all those bogus subjects at ten shillings
each raise a loyal cheer the hoax will
be complete this is the artistic touch
to make the job perfect

  and what am i to do after that
mr huntley if you please timidly
inquired the elderly clerk if its only

a practical joke i dont mind-

 play the part thompson ac-
knowledge the homage of the ships
company and go below at once the
ship will probably be watched by per-
sons keenly interested in your move-
ments if they poke a mess of legal
documents at you accept them without
argument and walk ashore and return
to london the meddlesome gents
tvill leave you alone after that they
ivill merely keep close watch of the ship
to make sure that you dont go back
to her once in london again pluck
off the false whiskers and be sure to
come to my office in the morning and
be handsomely rewarded for your ex-
ertions

chapter viii

one king shy

  the genuine colonists of king os-
mond stole on board the tarlington
singly and by twos and threes soifie
before she pulled out of the docks
others by boat after she swung into

the stream at the same time the imi-
tation voyagers from the employment
agency were making as much noise and
bustle as possible as they trooped on
board the tyneshire glen

  captain oshea intended to convoy
the king from the hotel to the tarling-
ton but at the last moment he was de-
tained to quell a ruction among a group
of drunken firemen in the forecastle
george huntley had been unexpectedly
summoned to the hotel cecil to see an
american millionaire who was in a
great hurry to charter a yacht oshea
therefore sent a message to his maj-
esty directing him to have his carriage
driven to a certain landing on the river
front of the east india docks where
he would be met by the chief officer of
the tarlington and escorted aboard the
ship

  within the same hour the dignified
elderly clerk by the name of thompson
could have been seen to enter a car-
riage close by the hotel carleton and
those standing near might have heard
him tell the driver to go to the steamer
tyneshire glen in the east india
docks

  the chief officer of the tarlington
waiting not far from an electric light
at the landing pier abreast of which the
steamer was anchored in the stream
felt a certain responsibility for the safe
delivery of king osmond and was eas-
ier in mind when he saw a carriage halt
within a few yards of him the win-
dow framed the kindly features the
white mustache and imperial which the
chief officer instantly identified has-
tening to assist his majesty from the
carriage he announced apologetically

  captain oshea sends his compli-
ments and regrets that he is detained
on board the ship is ready as soon as
you are

  the king murmured a word or two
of thanks the chief officer carefully
assisted him to board the tug which
immediately backed away from the pier
and turned to run alongside the tar-
lington the important passenger
mounted the ships gangway and stood
upon the shadowy deck whose row of
lights had been purposely turned off


the popular magazine

lest the figure of the king might be
discernible from shore

  captain oshea had delayed on the
bridge to get the ship under way as
soon as the skipper of the tug sang out
to him that his majesty was safely
aboard it was no time for ceremony
the business of the moment was to
head for the open sea and beyond the
reach of the british law and its offi-
cers

  a few minutes later captain oshea
hastened aft to greet his majesty and
explain his failure to welcome him on
board meeting the chief officer he
halted to ask

  everything all right mr arbuth-
not  did he ask for me  did he give
you any orders

  all satisfactory sir the king said
he was very tired and would go to his
rooms at once

  i wonder should i disturb him
said oshea to himself hesitating
 tis not etiquette to break into his
rest well i will go back to the bridge
and wait a bit maybe he will be send-
ing for me my place is with the pilot
till the ship has poked her way past
gravesend and is clear of this muck
of upriver shipping

  the tarlington found a less-crowded
reach of the thames as she passed be-
low greenwich and her engines began
to shove her along at a rapid gait she
had almost picked up full speed and
was fairly bound out for blue water
when the noise of loud and grievous
protests arose from the saloon deck
the commotion was so startling that
oshea bounded down from the bridge
and was confronted by a smooth-
shaven slender elderly man who flour-
ished a false mustache andimperial in
his fist as he indignantly cried

  i say this is all wrong as sure as
my name is thompson i never bar-
gained with mr george huntley to be
kidnaped and taken to sea i dont
want to go i tell you these people
tell me that this steamer is bound to
some island or other thousands of miles
from here i stand on my rights as an
englishman i demand that i be taken
back to london at once

  oshea glared stupidly at the irate
clerk so long in the employ of tavi-
stock  huntley for once the re-
sourceful shipmaster was so- taken
aback that he could only blink and open
and shut his mouth at length he man-
aged to say in a sort of quavering stage
whisper

  for the love o heaven what has
become of the real king who mislaid
him  where is he now 

  i dont know and im sure i dont
care bitterly returned the affrighted
thompson i was an ass to consent
to this make-believe job

  but how did you two kings get
mixed groaned oshea youre in
the wrong ship have ye not sense
enough to fathom that much you
wrere supposed to go aboard the tyne-
shire glen you old blunderer

  the man who drove the carriage
told me this was the tyneshire glen i
had to take his word for it how was
i to know one ship from another in
the dark i was told to pretend i was
the genuine king wasnt i  so i played
the part as well as i could

  ye played it right up to the hilt
my chief officer will vouch for that
and oshea held his head between his
hands he sent for johnny kent
whose chin dropped when he beheld the
miserable crushed demeanor of the
master of the tarlington who an-
nounced briefly

  were shy one king johnny the
deal was switched on us somehow our
boss was left behind

  great sufferin caesars ghost capn
mike gasped the other say it
slow spell it out make signs if
youre so choked up that you cant talk
plain

  the real king went in the discard
johnny weve fetched the dummy to
sea the one that came aboard was
the other one

  then what in blazes became of our
beloved king osmond i  cried
johnny

  you can search me maybe his af-
fectionate relatives have their hooks in
him by now and have started him on
the road to the dotty house
the king and captain oshea

iii

  it aint reasonable for us to keep
on our course for trinadaro without
the boss of the whole works suggest-
ed the chief engineer this is his ship
md cargo

  this was soself-evident that captain
oshea answered never a word but
gave orders to let go an anchor and
hold the ship in the river until further
notice then he turned to glower at
an excited group of passengers who
had mustered at the foot of the bridge
ladder and were loudly demanding that
he come down and talk to them they
were loyal subjects of the vanished
monarch-his secretaries artisans
foremen laborers-who ardently de-
sired an explanation they become
more and more insistent and threat-
ened to resort to violence unless the
steamer instantly returned to london
to find king osmond

  oshea gave them his word that he
would not proceed to sea without the
missing sovereign and during a brief
lull in the excitement he thrust the be-
wildered thompson the masquerader
into the chart room and pelted him with
questions the latter was positive that
he had directed the cabman to drive to
the tyneshire glen could the cabman
have purposely sought the wrong ship
no for he was particular to stop and
ask his way when just inside the en-
trance to the docks and while he was
talking to the informant who looked
like a watchman another person had
stepped up to volunteer the desired in-
formation

  the watchman had moved on and
the cabman and the second stranger
held a conversation which thompson
was unable to overhear

  and did ye get a look at this sec-
ond party sharply queried oshea

  the carriage lamp showed me his
face for a moment and i saw him less
distinctly as he moved away he was
a young man well dressed rather a
smart-looking chap i should say i
think he had on a fancy red waist-
coat

  sandy-complected a brisk walk-
er roared oshea in tremendous
tones

  i am inclined to say the description
fits the young man said thompson

   twas the crooked minister of
finance baron frederick martin
strothers bad luck to him and
oshea looked bloodthirsty ill bet
the ship against a cigar that he sold
out to the enemy he stands in with
the kings blackguardly relatives and
the lawyers and we never fooled him
for a minute tis likely he switched
the real king to the tyneshire glen
where the poor monarch would have
no friends to help him out of a scrape
strothers and a pal bribed the two cab-
men-thats how the trick was turned
just how they got next to our plans i
cant fathom but we will not discuss it
now

  then it is hopeless to try to secure
the king and transfer him to this
steamer asked thompson easier in
mind now that he understood that he
had not been kidnaped

  hopeless by me sainted grand-
mother it is not hopeless at all cried
captain oshea as he fled from the
chart room to confer with his chief of-
ficer johnny kent restless and un-
happy had made another journey from
the lower regions to seek enlighten-
ment oshea thumped him between
the shoulders and confidently de-
claimed 

  weve finished with all the foolish
play acting and stratagems twas done
to spare the sensitive feeling of king
osmond and this wide-awake stroth-
ers has made monkeys of us he
stacked the cards and dealt us the
wrong king now were going to turn
around and steam back to london and
grab this king of ours and take him
to sea without any more delay at all

  i like your language beamingly
quoth johnny kent were due to
have a little violence capn mike

chapter ix

  the abduction of king osmond

  while the good ship tarlington
swings about and retraces her course
there is time to discover what befell
the genuine osmond afterhe had en-


the popular magazine

tered a carriage at the hotel carleton
and set out to join captain osheas
steamer if it is correct to surmise that
the unscrupulous baron strothers was
the active villain of the plot then he
may have tampered with king os-
monds cabman or employed an agent
to attend to the shabby business before
the equipage left the hotel

  at any rate the king was rapidly
driven to the east india docks and the
carriage drew up alongside the tyne-
shire glen the royal occupant had
been informed by captain oshea that
his ship would be out of the docks by
now and that a tug would be waiting
to transfer him in the darkness the
shadowy outline of one steamer looked
very like another and king osmond
thought that perhaps the plan of sailing
might have been changed at the last
moment

  the cabman strenuously assured him
that this wras the tarlington and he
decided that he had better go aboard
and look for captain oshea if a mis-
take had been made it ought to be an
easy matter to find the landing pier and
the waiting tug

  no sooner had the deluded king
reached the deck than he was con-
vinced that he had been directed to the
wrong steamer the people who stared
at him curiously were utter strangers
there was not a subject of trinadaro
among them nor did any of the officers
of the ship step forward to greet him
he was about to accost the nearest
spectator when an officious man
dressed in seedy black confronted him
flourished a formidable-appearing doc-
ument under the royal nose and pomp-
ously affirmed

  a writ from the judge duly ap-
pointed and authorized by the lord
chancellor to take cognizance of such
cases distraining colonel osmond
george sydenham-leach from attempt-
ing to quit the jurisdiction of said court
pending an inquisition de lunatico in-
quirendo take it calm and easy sir
this wont interfere with your liberty
as long as you obey the writ

  another minion of the law-a fat
man with a well-oiled voice-thereupon

formally took possession of the
steamer explaining that because clear-
ance papers had been issued for a voy-
age to trinadaro the court held that a
departure from england was actually
and speedily contemplated the pres-
ence of colonel sydenham-leach on
board in person was also evidence after
the fact

  the blow was staggering humiliat-
ing incredibly painful it shook the
amiable gentlemans presence of mind
to the very foundations to be inter-
fered with as an alleged madman was
enough to bewilder the most sapient
monarch that ever wielded scepter
as a landed proprietor a retired officer
of the militia a conservative in poli-
tics king osmond had profound re-
spect for the law and the constitution
of his native land he was not one to
defy a judicial writ or to grapple with
the situation in a high-handed manner
in other words he was rather colonel
sydenham-leach in this cruel crisis
than the sovereign ruler of the inde-
pendent principality of trinadaro

  no help or comfort was to be ob-
tained from the company around him
these spurious voyagers from the em-
ployment agency were whispering un-
easily among themselves and regarding
the unfortunate osmond with suspi-
cious glances they had not bargained
to entangle themselves in the affairs of
an alleged lunatic on board of a ship
which had been seized in the name of
the law ten shillings was not enough
for this sort of thing

  it dont look right to me said one
of them the job is on the queer i
say we hook it before the bloomin
bobbies come and put the lot of us in
jail

  this sentiment expressed the general
view of the situation and the counter-
feit subjects of trinadaro began to
flock down the gangway and to scatter
in a hunted manner among the gloomy
warehouses presently colonel syden-
ham-leach was left alone with the twro
court officers with never a friend in
sight recovering somewhat of his
composure and dignity he declared that
he must consult with his legal advisers
the king an captain oshea



at once before consenting to leave the
ship he clung to the hope that delay
might enable captain oshea to come
to his rescue although he was unwill-
ing to try to send a message to the
tarlington this would reveal to the
officers of the law that the wrong ship
had been detained and put them on
the track of the right one

  there was no legal reason why the
luckless king should not remain in the
tyneshire glen until his lawyers could
come and confer with him wherefore
the captors grumblingly sat themselves
down in the cabin to wait the king
had nothing more to say to them thej
were beneath his notice he was ab-
sorbed in his own unhappy reflections
his dreams had turned to ashes his
island empire would know him not he
felt very old and helpless and sad

  thus he sat and brooded for some
time at length he heard the sound of
men tramping across the deck above his
head he roused himself to look in the
direction of the doorway a moment
later it framed the well-knit active fig-
ure of captain michael oshea be-
hind him puffed stout johnny kent
they paused said something to each
other and advanced to bid the drooping
captive take heart

   twas a good guess your majesty
cried oshea we thought you might
have gone adrift and fetched up aboard
this old tub whats the matter who
are your two friends

  officers from the bench of one of
the judges in lunacy reluctantly ad-
mitted king osmond they have
served distraining papers on me and
on the ship

  on this ship exclaimed johnriy
kent how ridiculous whatll we
do with this pair of bailiffs or what-
ever you call em capn mike make
em eat their documents 

  no we will take the two meddlers
along with us sweetly answered
oshea we cant afford to leave
them behind to tell how it happened
but they have all the power and au-
thority of the british government be-
hind them spoke up king osmond

  and they have a long voyage ahead
a

of them said oshea your majesty
can give them jobs in your own judicial
department and they will grow up with
the country

  i cannot countenance such actions
began the king but johnny kent inter-
rupted to remark with much vehe-
mence 

  excuse us your majesty but this
aint no time for arguments about the
british constitution capn mike and
me agreed to take you and your ship
to trinadaro it was a contract and
we propose to earn our wages if you
wont come easy and willin then well
just have to call a couple of our men
from the boat thats waitin alongside
and escort you anyhow were stub-
born and we aim to live up to our
agreements

  oshea wasted no more words sud-
denly grasping one of the officers by
the back of the neck and the slack of
his garments he propelled him rapidly
toward the deck fiercely admonishing
him to make no outcry unless he wished
to be tossed overboard with a bullet in
him

  the other man had started to flee
but johnny kent caught him in a few
heavy strides tucked him under one
mighty arm clapped a hand over his
mouth and waddled with his burden to
the nearest open cargo port

  drop them into the boat com-
manded oshea ahoy there below 
catch these two lads and sit on them
good and hard and let them make no
noise the end of an oar handle be-
hind the ear will make them subside
if they object

  the astonished king osmond had
followed the abductors out of the cabin
before he could renew the discussion
captain oshea breathing hard but
calm and smiling faced him with the
courteous invitation

  after you your majesty we are
at your service a few minutes in the
boat and youll be aboard the tarling-
ton and heading for the open sea

  it was obviously so futile to protest
that the king meekly descended to the
boat steadied by the helping hand of


the cpcpulcr magazine

johnny kent the seamen shoved off
and the oars thumped in the tholepins
as oshea steered for the long black
hull of the steamer visible a few hun-
dred yards down stream unable to
voice his confused emotions the king
suffered himself to be conducted up the
gangway of the tarlington

  his loyal subjects-the real ones-
cheered frantically at sight of him it
was an ovation worthy of his station
he bowed and smiled and was himself
again already the recollection of his
detention as a madman seemed less
poignant it wras like a nightmare he
would try to forget it

  he felt the ship tremble under his
feet as her engines began to drive her
toward the blessed sea and the long
road to wave-washed trinadaro had
it not been for the bold and ready con-
duct of his two faithful mariners he
would now be a broken-spirited old
man in london a butt of public ridi-
cule he went below to the staterooms
which had been suitably fitted for his
comfort and privacy and discovered
that he was greatly wearied

  before retiring he sent one of his
secretaries to request captain oshea
and johnny kent to give him the pleas-
ure of their company at breakfast next
morning

  that makes me feel a bit more
cheerful said oshea to himself
maybe he has decided to forgive us
we were guilty of high treason dis-
obedience and a few other things in
packing him off to sea while he was
trying to tell us he couldnt go at all
poor old johnny kent was worried for
fear he would order our heads chopped
off

  the tarlington was in blue water
next morning when the captain and the
chief engineer bashfully entered the
private dining room of his majesty
the latter greeted them with marked
affability and said

  i take great pleasure my dear
friends in conferring on you the in-
signia of the grand cross of trina-
daro as a recognition of your invalu-
able loyalty and assistance you will
be entitled to call yourselves barons of

my realm by royal warrant while i
must confess that i could not ordinarily
approve of such summary methods as

you made use of-

  it looks different now that old eng-
land is dropping astern suggested
oshea the british constitution
doesnt loom as big as it did your own
flag is at the masthead your majesty
and you can make treaties if ye like i
thank you with all my heart for the
reward you have given me

  it pleases me a heap more to be a
member of the nobility of trinadaro
than to earn big wages for the voy-
age warmly assented johnny kent

chapter x

  in sight of tiie island kingdom

  freed of all anxieties and beset-
ments the royal passenger resumed his
labor of planning the occupations of
his subjects his enthusiasm was de-
lightful to behold lie seemed to grow
younger with every day of the voyage
southward his was to be a kingdom
of peace and good will of a benevolent
ruler and a contented industrious peo-
ple lie was the stanchest kind of a
royalist and trinadaro was to be a con-
stitutional monarchy with an aristoc-
racy which should be recruited after
the pioneerng work had been accom-
plished the existing theories and ex-
amples of republican government he re-
garded with peculiar disfavor

  the relations between the king and
his mariners twain became those of
pleasant informal intimacy they
learned to know him much better dur-
ing the long weeks at sea and felt to-
ward him an affectionate tolerant re-
spect he was wrapped up in his one
idea his belief that he was indeed
a king was as natural as breathing

  the ship had crossed the equator
and was plowing through the long blue
surges of the south atlantic when cap-
tain oshea after working out the
noon observations informed the king
a couple of days more and well
begin to look for a sight of the peaks
of trinadaro if the weather holds
the king and captain oshea



calm we can begin to put the people
and the cargo ashore right after that

  the peaks of trinadaro fondly
echoed king osmond do you know
captain oshea i have wandered if
you considered me a crack-brained old
fool many men in england think so
i am sure i know that my relatives
do

   tis my opinion that you wish to
make folks happy and that you will do
no harm with your money was the
reply and theres few rich men that
can say the same no tis not crack-
brained to want to be a king power
is what men desire and they will tram-
ple on others to get it i have heard
ye talk on board ship and i have ad-
mired what you had to say you will
live your own life in your own way but
you will not forget to make this island
of yours a place for men and women
to call home and to be glad that they
have found it

  i thank you captain oshea said
the other i cannot help thinking now
and then of what will be the fate of
my principality when death comes to
me if i am spared for ten or fifteen
years longer i shall have time to set
my affairs in order to make trinadaro
self-sustaining to win the recognition
of foreign governments to arrange for
an administration to succeed my reign

  may you live to be king until you
are a hundred cried oshea and a
man who is as happy and contented as
you are is pretty sure of a ripe old
age

  i hope that you and mr kent will
consent to sail under the flag of my
merchant jmarine and navy as long as
i live earnestly said the king i
have learned to depend on you and i
need not tell you that the financial ar-
rangement will be more favorable than
you could make elsewhere

  we are restless men your majesty
replied oshea with a smile but we
have no notion of quitting your service
tis up to us to see the kingdom fairly
under way before we turn rovers
again

it was early in the morning of the
second day after this that the officer

on watch roused out captain oshea
with the news that land had been sight-
ed on the starboard bow the master
of the tarlington stared through his
binoculars at a black jagged foreland
of rock which lifted itself from the sea
he sent word to the passengers that
trinadaro lay ahead of them

  king osmond had left word that he
should be called whenever the first
glimpse of his island should be re-
vealed but he came not to the bridge
in response to the message from cap-
tain oshea in his stead appeared his
physician with a demeanor terribly dis-
tressed his voice was unsteady as he
said to captain oshea

  it is my sad duty to inform you
that his majesty-passed away some time
during the night his heart simply
ceased to beat it had been somewhat
feeble and irregula of late but the
symptoms were not alarming his
strength was overtaxed during those
last weeks in london

  oshea bared his head and stood
silent the announcement was very
hard to believe pulling himself to-
gether he murmured to the chief offi-
cer 

  the king is dead please set the
flag of trinadaro at half mast

  as soon as the word was passed
down to the engine room johnny kent
sought the bridge and his eyes were
filled with tears as he exclaimed

  it dont seem right capn mike i
aint reconciled to it one mite he de-
served to have what he wanted and
he dies within sight of his kingdom
yes he has slipped his cable
johnny there are cruel tricks in this
game of life

  what will you do now

  i havent had time to think but
one thing is certain i will carry king
osmond to his island and there we will
bury him tis the one place in all the
world where he would want to rest
and the peaks of trinadaro will guard
him and the big breakers will sing an-
thems for him and he will be the
king there till the judgment day

  the tarlington slowly approached
the precipitous coast line and changed


the popular magazine

her course to pass around to the lee of
the island as the deeply indented
shore opened to view and one bold
headland after another slid by a com-
paratively sheltered anchorage was dis-
closed

  there to the amazement of captain
oshea rode two small cruisers one
of them flew the red ensign of england
the other the green and yellow colors
of the navy of brazil he guessed
their errand before a british lieutenant
in white uniform came alongside the
tarlington in a steam launch and
climbed the gangway which had been
dropped to receive him

  gazing curiously at the silent com-
pany and the half-masted flag of trina-
daro he was conducted into the saloon
where captain oshea waited for him
to state his business

  this steamer belongs to colonel
sydenham-leach i presume said the
visitor i should like to meet him if
you please sorry but i have unpleas
ant news for him

  if it is king osmond of trinadaro
ye mean he is dead god rest his soul
he went out last night

  you dont say please express my
sympathy to the ships company ex-
claimed the lieutenant how extraor-
dinary  we received orders by cable
at rio to proceed to trinadaro in time
to interceot this vessel of yours

  and what were the orders and why
is that brazilian man-of-war anchored
alongside of you asked oshea

  it is all about the ownership of this
island the lieutenant explained no-
body wanted it for centuries and now
everybody seems keen on getting hold
of it the english government sud-
denly decided after you sailed from
london that it might need trinadaro
as a landing base for a new cable be-
tween south america and africa and
sent us to hoist the flag over the place
brazil heard of the affair and sent a
ship to set up a claim on the basis of
an early discovery the portuguese
have presented their evidence i believe
because their people made some kind of
a settlement at trinadaro once upon a
time

  and the forsaken island was totally
forgotten until poor king osmond got
himself and his project into the news-
papers slowly commented oshea

  that is the truth of the matter i
fancy the naval lieutenant paused
and commiseration was strongly reflect-
ed in his manly face tell me said
he what was the opinion at home
about this king of trinadaro he was
a bit mad i take it

  no more than you or me answered
oshea he had a beautiful dream
and it made him very happy but it was
not his fate to see it come true and
no doubt it is better that he did not
live to know that the scheme was
ruined his island has been taken away
from him it will be wrangled over by
england and brazil and the rest of
them and there is no room for a king
that hoped to enjoy himself in his own
way the world has no place for a
man like colonel osmond george
sydenhani-leach my dear sir

  too bad sighed the lieutenant
and what are your plans captain
oshea  do you intend to make any
formal claim in behalf of the late
king

  no his dreams died with him
there is no heir to the throne im
thankful that his finish was so bright
and hopeful there will be funeral
services and a burial to-morrow i
should take it as a great favor if de-
tachments from the british cruiser and
the brazilian war vessel could be pres
ent

  i will attend to it said the lieu-
tenant

  when the coffin of king osmond i
was carried ashore it was draped with
the flag of trinadaro which he himself
had designed launches from the two
cruisers towed sailing cutters filled with
bluejackets who splashed through the
surf and formed in column led by the
bugles and the muffled drums the pa-
rade wound along the narrow valleys
climbing to the plateau on which the
ruler had planned to build his capital

  there the first and last king of
trinadaro was laid to rest and the
guns of the cruisers thundered a
the king and captain oshea

requiem the british lieutenant count-
ed the guns and turned to captain
oshea to say

  it is the salute given only to royalty 
according to the navy regulations it
is the least we can do for him

  and it is handsomely done mut-
tered the grateful oshea as he brushed
a hand across his eyes

  will you take your ship back to
england 

  yes i can do nothing else twill
be a sad voyage but god knows best
as it all turned out this king of ours
had to die to win his kingdom

  when the mourners had returned to
the tarlington captain oshea and
johnny kent went into the chart room
and talked together for some time at

length the gray portly simple-hearted
chief engineer said wistfully

  im glad we stood by and did what
we could for him capn mike aint
you 

  you bet i am johnny he was a
good man and i loved him heres to
his majesty king osmond of trina-
daro  he wanted us to sail under his
flag as long as he lived therell be
trouble waiting for us in london river
for we have to account for the pair of
court officers we kidnaped and the ship
that took out no clearances but we
will face the music tis not much to
do for him that was so good to us

  well anyhow they can never take
his kingdom away from him softly
quoth johnny kent

     there is another story about captain oshea and johnny kent coming in the next
issue of the popular

the army kept by hearst

ne evening mr and mrs william r hearst wrent to the offices of the hearst
paper in new york mr hearst wanted to print an interview with a visit-
ing statesman and most of all he wanted to get it in a hurry

    please tell brown to go out said hearst and get me a good story from
senator blank

    oh responded the secretary mr brown is acting night editor mr
hearst

    oh very well send craig

     but you see mr hearst mr craig is assistant night editor to the acting

con in conservation

yes said leighton and theyve been putting it there ever since
bucking the -hoodoo

by robert v carr

author of range manners   things that count etc

     this is the tale of an automobile that shattered the peace of a big
     good-natured westerner a hoodoo -car yet there is one man
     in the live-stock commission business who takes off his hat to it

speakin of hoodoos reminds me
of what doc strate said about a
friend of his he called tomb-
stone seth

  says doc im not what you-all
could call superstitious but just as sure
as that feller tombstone darkens my
door i know that something unlucky is
due to happen last time he called was
a sunday and come to find out there
wasnt a drop of licker in the house
seems miz strate had give the last of
our corn juice to deacon sniff kins
wife for medicinal purposes the deac
was feelin so poorly that he dreened
the jug and there me and tombstone
set that whole blessed sunday as dry
as burned boots and everything closed
personally i never like to start on a
trip of a friday and when friday falls
on thirteen-well i just sit tight and
wait for something to drop and on
the thirteenth day of the thirteenth
month of the thirteenth year which
happened a day or so ago i thought it
just the mercy of a kind-hearted crea-
tor that the world didnt come to an
end still i aint what you could call
downright superstitious just a little
shy of one or two things

  but a man rustlin live-stock ship-
ments for as wide awake a commission
man as billy dayton has no business
layin in his room just because it hap-
pens to be friday the thirteenth yet
i wish id had the sense to circle around
the hoodoo instead of coaxin it to land

on me but as ive said before a man
on the road cant let feelins interfere
with business if he does hes mighty
liable to wake up some pretty mornin
with a can tied to him and his little job
among the fatally injured

  but lets hop into the action

  phil brayton owned a big general
store and one of the finest cow ranches
in the blessed west he was a big
good-natured old scout and always
looked like hed wintered well he ate
beef three times a day laughed a whole
lot and if hed any troubles he told
em only to the lord

  everything around phil looked fat
and happy hosses always in good con-
dition cattle the best on the range

  never a meal on the brayton ranch
but what a dozen or fifteen travelers or
neighbors throwed their feet under the
big table and nobody paid for grub
or hoss feed at phils ranch

  he was the big man of his town and
country man woman or child in
trouble always went to phil and he al-
ways helped them belonged to no
church talked pretty rough and the
gossips said he was a swift old traveler
but take it from me folks who needed
help instead of advice sure knew phil
brayton was the old boy to go to

  phil and me were great friends but
for some reason unknown to me i could
not land his business for the dayton
live stock commission company
every time id tackle him hed just

     the last story of carrs dealing with the experiences of the live-stock commission man appeared in
the february month-end popular
bucking the hoodoo



laugh and tell me a funny story after
a time i quit talkin business to him
just kidded along and let it go at that

  then one fatal day phil got what he
called an automobile and it was some
auto class yes and tell the neigh-
bors i said so call me lip over long
distance at a dollar a second and ill
put in a day tellin you that there was
class to phils auto

  it was right close to calf-brandin
time when  falls off the varnished cars
and heads into phils store hed just
sold a young rancher a cook stove and
a baby buggy and is joshin the newly-
weds hes right glad to see me and
later on we go down to the white front
and tea up a little

  a few drinks and a lot of joshin and
then phil says i tell you what im
goin to do with you johnny im goin
to take you out to the ranch in my au-
tomobile

  your automobile i cheeps some
surprised the skunk wragons hadnt
invaded the range yet and i was as
much set back as though hed told me
hed bought a flyin machine

  yes indeedy phil cinches his of-
fer ill take you to my ranch-and
you know its a hundred miles-in less
time than a cat could spat a bulldogs
eye startin fairly early well hit the
ranch to-morrow afternoon in time for
a late dinner

  its a great little machine he goes
on as proud and happy as a new daddy
tolks in chicago i buy goods of sent
it along as a present havent tried it
out yet but it will run o k-that is
accordin to the directions that come
with it first automobile in this coun-
try and youll have the honor of bein
the first passenger its a ding-daisy

  i thinks that while phils mind is
little weak on his auto ill slip up on
his blind side with a business proposi-
tion so i asks him square if he is
goin to ship his cattle to billy dayton
put the old cutie dont pay any attention
to my cow talk- hes all wrapped up in
his auto

  says he aint it marvelous what
theyre doin these days with machin-
ery  now that little car of mine-

  i saw there was no use when a
man gets to callin a coal-oil can four
pieces of rubber and some balin wire
my car look out he may not get
violent but he ought to be watched

  i stood back a little from phil and
looked him over but i kept still when
a man has automobilous you never can
tell which way hell jump

  but i thinks that in time phil will be
himself again and i concludes to take
up his invite im lonesome for the
range anyway and theres always a
chance for new business

  so we rigs it up that phil is to call
for me in the mornin at the hotel and
ill hop into his wonderful little ben-
zine buggy for a hundred-mile spin

  we fools around a good share of the
day and night and then parts i to my
room and phil to his house and we
was both glad there was no snow on
the ground for it would have taken a
crab to follow our corkscrew trails
such is friendship

  next mornin after breakfast im in
the hotel office rollin a cigarette all
of a sudden i hears what sounds like
the battle of gettysburg and a wreck
on the elevated combined and along
with that was a lot of little sounds
one for example sounded like the
broken drivin rod of a limited engine
poundin the ties

  it had another little sound that
started out with blac-blac-boom-ber-
rang and then rik-a-chickic-rik-a-
chickie-spow-eek-s-s-sh-bang

  i yells to the hotel clerk freight
run into the coal chute 

  but the slick-head dont show no ex-
citement and i calms down and quits
dodgin

  he yawns a little behind a glass dia-
mond ring and explains only phil
brayton tunin up his auto-go-devil
when she gets to goin good get out
your ear muffs shes just whisprin
now-sort of gettin used to her own
voice soons she comes into her real
voice everybody has to make signs and
run and tie down all the bronks in town
runs like a rock crusher with a lump
in its neck

  he stabs his pen into a fresh potato


the cpocpullcr magazine

and takes a high-priced cigar out of the
case he was workin on a salary then
he takes up his little thread of thought
as the feller says

  phils sure mashed on that machine
but personally i wouldnt have it as a
gift and i wouldnt ride in it for all of
john ds greasy coin the blamed
thing shoots seven distinct different
ways and all of them fatal

  so says i

  uh-huh comes back the clerk gen-
tlelike

  the horrible sound kept cornin
nearer and nearer pozu-wak-a-wak
-kiz-kiz-ber-oomp-bang and then
oosh like shed died in the ditch with
none to weep and none to care

  i forces myself to go out on the hotel
porch and finds phil settin in his car

  she was still breathin in short jerks
and he made signs for me to get in the
hind seat he looked as happy as a kid
with a pair of red-top boots

  if i must say it im game when im
drove into a corner i couldnt argue
with phil as it wears you out quick to
argue in the sign language i didnt
like the looks of the thing-wanted to
back out but i couldnt see my way
clear i had to come clean or take the
count

  so i fogs back into the hotel and
makes signs to the clerk to wire my
wife in case anything happens and
grabs up my grip and rain coat then
i happens to look up at the big clock
suffrin moses its friday the thir-
teenth 

  right then i concludes not to go with
phil

  i goes out and yells in his ear stallin
about not feelin well its no go he
bawls back that the trip will do me a
world of good then i has to tell him
that its on account of friday the thir-
teenth

  he laughs until i can hear him above
the windmill clatter of his car then
he kind of subdues the corn sheller and
begins to coax me but im rock-set
and cemented nothin doin with
johnny reeves on friday the thir-
teenth

  finally phil says tell you what ill

do hop in and go out with me and
if we has any real sort of accident ill
ship my cattle to your outfit as longs
ive a hoof im makin it an object to
you when you ought to feel honored
i like your company well go through
as slick as butter in a hot skillet aint
my proposition a fair one  come on
and get in friday the thirteenth he
laughs lord love me thats my lucky
day i always used to go courtin on
that day get in get in youve only
one life to live

   for a spell i stood thinkin it over i
feels a cold hunch that something will
happen-and that it will be bad still
business is business and phil had give
me his word about his cattle

  i therefore crawls into the hind seat
and yells  let her rip 

  phil pulls out a stopper or two and
she says yare-it-yurc-it-awk-
awk then phil twists a crank and
she remarks oomph-etty-oomph-
siz-z-z-c-c-ek  but refuses to budge

  shes a queer-lookin flyin jinny
with ropes runnin back around her
wheels shes built like a mountain
wagon and looked like a cross between
a hay baler and a pianola

  phil keeps on a-monkeyin with her
feelin her pulse lookin down her neck
and tryin to use reason but she wont
move

  sorry i didnt bring my bed i
says we could camp right here
phil dont say nothin just keeps on
twistin cranks and pullin levers

   finally he admits shes just a little
mite peevish this mornin

  by that time quite a crowd has gath-
ered and everybody is offerin advice
if theres anything the american is free
with its advice seems like most of
us know what everybody but ourselves
should do

  maybe you got her checked up too
high says one feller or maybe you
forgot to grain her

  throw a drink into her suggests
another

  call her sweetheart cheeps a bright
mind

   but phil dont let em rattle him just
keeps on workin
bucking the hoodoo



  at last he twists the right snivvie
and she gives a cough

  left lung almost gone says some
sport run for the doctor

  she coughs again and phil twirls to
the keyboard and pulls out fhe alto stop
and he just does it in time for with
flags flyin whistles blowin gongs
beatin bands playin and every hoss in
town kickin his stall down shes on her
way

  phil heads her for the open country
first thing we meets is a rancher set-
tin half asleep on a sagged-down seat
and drivin a pair of dead-on-their-feet
bronks do them bronks come to life
seems like i remember that they did
gettin down to facts i might say them
plugs climbed right up the side of the
sky and you could hear em snort for
miles i catches a glimpse of a pair of
broom tails pushin aside the air away
over yonder some place and sees the
rancher settin in a plowed field with a
wagon tire around his neck and lookin
sort of stunnedlike at a piece of rein in
his hand he was for days remember-
in his post-office address and the last i
heard of him he thought he was little
eva in uncle toms cabin

  on we go like the end of the world
and no place to land blang-blang-
ber-run  sooie-ik-ik-ik-enkcty-imk
-unhcty-cnk

   phils workin like one of them fancy
piano players at the levers im holdin
down the hind seat hopin that ill make
a decent-lookin corpse and that theyll
spell my name right in the papers

  pretty soon we meets a bunch of
cow-punchers-the new would-be kind
-cornin to town with their chaper
deroes and their taperderoes and their
flapper deroes on and then we hits
them for a time it rained catalogue
cow-punchers worth ten cents a gross
f o b chicago i remember seein a
bronk standin on his left ear with a so-
called cowboy wrapped around his neck
like an old shawl the air was full of
useless junk and rattlesnake hatbands
one of the bronks has heart failure en-
tirely and lays off one side his eyes
bulgin like them big glass marbles set
in a sack of meal i dont suppose that

bronk was ever the same afterward and
probly aged fast i could just hear
that hoss say whats the use to try
to wake up-its only the nightmare

  phil bawls back at me stay with
her johnny shes workin fine aint
she a little humdinger

  i didnt try to reply i just hung on
and hoped the end would be painless i
never like the idea of bein all cut up
to take the big jump is nothin but id
like to go whole and not a piece at a
time

  we goes whackin across the first big
divide like a bat out of hell roars down
the slope and up the other side onto
the next divide

  for miles the range cattle with their
tails as straight as ramrods are runnin
off the face of the earth even the
prairie dogs turn back somersets and
fall out of sight believe me a prairie
dog has some sense right then if id
been one id dug down to china

  then in the middle of a big gumbo
flat twenty miles from nowhere she
gives a terrible wheeze gets something
crossways in her sunday throat and
stops sayin  phush-phush-pow-
phush-phush-pow

  phil pulls four or five stoppers but
she dont go she quits breathin turns
her face to the wall and seems to pass
in her checks

  wre gets out

  now what  i asks looks to me
like i was goin to get them cattle of
yours

  phil laughs and says as cheerful as
a jay bird this is nothin ill have
her fixed up in no time the directions
say she is liable to act this way i think
we overheated her

  phil goes to tinkerin after a spell
he gets sore hes covered with grease
and oil and is hot and sweaty hes
taken a gallon of burs and bolts out of
her and covered the prairie with old
iron

  right then i laughs a mean dirty
miserable little laugh

  he looks at me a minute and then
says  dont drive me too fur johnny

  then he goes back and gets the jug


the popular magazine

out of the back end of the concern and
takes a drink

  of course i says to a meadow lark
near by we can walk back its only
thirty miles

  phil dont say nothin he goes back
to his work pulls out a tube looks at
it tries to put it back sees it dont fit
and then finally says johnny youre a
kind-hearted feller but when a man
comes to know you youre as cruel as
an injun

  all of a sudden he plum loses his
patience he throws wrenches bars
and thing-a-ma-jigs at that machine
and cuss dont you know that when
one of them good-natured fellers gets
mad you can smell sulphur for days
afterward

  grits phil between his teeth with
that low mean bitter style of cussin
you winrow of night-bloomin holly-
hocks if i had an ax id break your
sweet little backbone you nice old
thing what right has a gumbo-headed
dash-and-so-forth to live who will take
up with a tin pan on four spools when
he has a good team in the barn a man

that will do a trick like that is a-

  you can figger out the rest to suit
yourself phil was sure sore he hits
the jug after hed sort of quit rockin
and tremblin and again takes up his
weary work

  ail of a sudden the old fly-by-night
sneezes

  dont know what ive done but ive
done it yells phil shes cornin to
she gradually comes out of her
trance spnmph-spnmph-spnmph-
pha-rik-pha-rik-rik-a-chickie rik-
chick-chick-phosh she comes to
life long enough to say good-by to all
her folks leave everything to charity
and then make another bluff at croakin

  shes all in this trip i says might
as well order her coffin

  aint that just naturally hell says
phil so softlike that a range steer
jumped off in a water hole on whose
edge hed been hangin since we come
wouldnt that just naturally knock the

- oh well lets have a drink

  he hists the jug in the hollow of his
arm and i seconds him

  maybe some one will come along
and haul us in i offers as a chunk of
hope

  nary hoss in the country will come
near us glooms phil

  he was right a team sighted us a
mile away and in spite of all the driver
could do made a broom-tailed circle a
half mile to the east of us they were
travelin at a stiff run

  ive reached the point where i dont
care i know the hoodoo is workin
fine and i am prepared for anything
ive give up

  so i takes out the lap robe and
spreads it on the ground says i not
earin whether i live or die says i
let me know when youre ready to
walk back if i should fall asleep do
not wake me too swiftly for i come up
fightin farewell

  i rolled a cigarette and lay back

  pah-fung says the machine just
that and no more phil jumped for it
and began pullin levers but no use
they were her dyin words pah-fung
was automobilese for good night

  then just when were clear down
and out the old corn shucker comes to
life bawlin bellerin and blowin
smoke phil had yanked the right lever

  jump in bellers my friend and we
both made it on the wing

  shes runnin but phil cant control
her she leaves the road and goes fog-
gin off through the sagebrush i see
the old shebang is bound to have our
lives and that she is headed straight for
a gully

  phil sees there is no use and sets
back waitin for the end like a nervy
man she stops within seven inches of
the jump-off and begins whisperin
ush-ush--ush

  we gets out once more and i walks
around her also i see what kind of a
load we are carryin in the back of
the old rattletrap is a case of dynamite
along with the jug and other necessities
then as a finish i looks at the old
shingle mills number drop me in my
tracks if it aint one-thirty-one-a thir-
teen goin or cornin read it backward
or forward it was thirteen says i
bucking the hoodoo



well wouldnt that get your rocky
mountain goat there seemed to be
no show to get out alive

  just as a polite question i asks phil
has that box of sudden death been
under me all this time 

  phil tells me that hes takin the pow-
der to the ranch to blast out a spring
he seems kind of surprised that such
a thing was worth askin a question
about funny thing about some men
finest kind of fellers will have a weak
spot in their head phil was careless
about powder if he was lookin for
something hed throw aside a box of
dynamite the same as if its cordwood
he buys and sells lots of it and i sup-
pose some day hell land on the other
side before the gatekeeper can punch
his ticket phil didnt look crazy but
then you never can tell theres some-
thing wrong with a man who will start
out on friday the thirteenth in a locoed
automobile with a box of dynamite un-
der the seat he may be able to stall
along for years and keep out of the
jimmy corral but some day hell let go
all bolts and its the giggle house for
him

  i comes up close to phil and says to
him just as gentle and kind as can be
poor suffriir critter you dont
know what youre doin i dont want
to hurt your feelins but if you must
know it i am about to bid farewell to
your little old torpedo boat on this
the thirteenth day known as friday i
will leave you with your darlin

  phil shook his head and went to tin-
kerin thats the way with the nutty
ones soons they go bugs they think
everybody else is crazy

  my poor unfortunate friend keeps
on a-fussin with miss helen trouble
and pretty soon she begins to show
signs of life but just as we are feelin
hopeful she gives a tired little moan
and turns up her toes

  no use phil i says the hoodoo
has got you for fair all you can do is
to leave her walk back to town and
make arrangements to ship your cattle
to illy dayton you are what is popu-
larly known as a gone goose

  but phil has a stubborn nature-

same as a cow in a mudhole he keeps
on tinkerin i lay back and smoke

  pretty soon it gets chilly and the
wind rises in a little while it banks
up black in the north and there comes
a rumble of thunder then the fun
starts an electric storm on the west-
ern prairie is no picnic and if you
want to see lighnin that is lightnin
youll find it on the range

  come away from that machine i
howls at phil as the long streaks of
death and destruction tear the sky in
two the old boy sees i am right
that machine is the only lightnin mark
for miles

  its dark now and we are flounderin
through gullies and washouts and doin
our best to get away from that machine

  and then comes the wind-up an
awful glare and a rip that sounded like
some one had tore the roof off of hell a
jar that rocked the world a red blast
and then darkness

  would you call that an accident
i asked phil as we crouched in a wash-
out dont forget your words spoken
to me in front of the hotel

  he kept still for at last the hoodoo
had got his goat

  the storm soon passed and a red sun
come out we concludes to try and
make it to the nearest ranch-ten miles

  thinks i that machine and all is
gone but were alive yet its still fri-
day the thirteenth there is yet time to
die

  we plugs down off the divide and
into the valley we are headin for a
ranch on the crick as we drags along
we notices a couple of riders swing out
from some cottonwoods and come to-
ward us we joy up at the sight of
them thinkin theyll give us a lift you
can figger that we are some surprised
when those gobblers ride up and throw
their six-guns down on us with that
cute little remark put em up--
quick

  both bein western raised we throws
up our hands

  the two riders has handkerchiefs
over their faces but i tumbles to who
they be they was the midbury broth-
ers a couple of hoss thieves and hold-


the popular magazine

ups that had created a lot of disturb-
ance on the other side of the territory
i knew one of them by the scar that
run up along his temple they were
them sandy-complected brocky bench-
legged kind ornery mean and vicious

  their hosses seemed fresh enough
but their clothes were rags they had
been drove by sheriff posses for two
hundred miles and they looked pretty
ragged

  just about of a size says one of
the scoundrels

  right you be comes back the other
son of a gun

  with that they both hops off their
hosses and while one keeps the iron on
us the other cleans us they took
phils watch and ring and tapped me
for a roll of expense money

  there aint much conversation at
such times you might think that you
would talk a lot when bein stuck up
but as a general rule you think of a lot
of things to say but dont say em

  for my part i knew the hoodoo was
workin at high pressure and that there
was no use to kick phil looked kind
of dazed

  when theyd searched us to suit one
of them shoves a gun against the small
of my back and says strip to the
hide

  the other holdup had his six against
phils back and phil was obeyin or-
ders

  wre stripped and stood out and
adam had nothin on us

  the holdups laughed something cruel

  says the biggest one we need the
clothes boys besides you fellers aint
goin to run and tell all you know right
now

  me and phil didnt say nothin

  the two devils bundle up our clothes
and hit the trail leavin us in bad shape

  i looked at phil for a spell i hated
to rub it in but i had to do it

  speakin of accidentsi says slow
and cruel if anybody should happen
to ask you would you call this an acci-
dent he did not answer and i went
on with the injun torture i must say
that clothes make a heap of difference
as i remember you phil when you had

your duds on you were a fair-lookin
man what you look like now i aint
got the heart to say

  johnny says the old boy kind of
pitifullike were in bad shape they
didnt even leave us our boots he
takes a step or two like a turkey walk-
in on hot iron

  no i agrees with him they did
not leave us anything but our honor
and mighty little of that

  we then starts out i guess wed
hobbled maybe a quarter of a mile when
phil stepped on a cactus he sat down
yellin and went to pickin at his foot
but he got up in a second as something
moved under his knees twas only a
lizard but phil thinks it is a rattler
for a big man he moved the quickest
i ever see

  gawd forgive me  he yells then
in a solemn pained voice there must
be something in that friday-the-thir-
teenth thing johnny were jonahed
from start to finish whatll we do
if the country gets onto this were gone
-never hear the last of it

  i looked at him for a minute or two
well you great big beautiful doll its

  phil balanced himself on one foot
and began pickin cactus thorns out of
the other

  bill horners ranch-ouch--is just

-lord love me-i spose

  lead on cleopatrai says may-
be we can get close enough to holler for
one of the horner kids to bring a pair
of blankets

  phil groans and leads the way

  its cornin dusk when with our feet
in tatters and bleedin from a thousand
scratches and chatterin with the cold
we gets in hailin distance of the hor-
ner ranch a lot of dogs run out and
we hear a woman callin we duck
down behind some brush yellin for all

thank heaven the dogs were friend-
ly enough though kind of surprised
we keep on yellin
bucking the hoodoo



  a won  s voice calls whats
wanted 

  i dont like the sound of her voice
it has a cold desperate ring to it

  its phil brayton bawls my friend
send one of the boys with a pair of
blankets

  you cant fool me you scum of
earth screams the woman and then
bang goes a rifle and a bullet whines
spee-zving over our heads the hoodoo
is still up and doin

  friday the thirteenth i croaks and
burrows into the earth

  another shot and phil begins diggin
like a badger please missis horner
dont shoot he yells brayton
brayton brayton

  at last the woman catches a note in
phils voice that convinces her that
something is wrong

  she quits shootin and screams
whats the matter why dont you
show yourself

  phil raises up a little and bawls for
all hes worth holdups took clothes
send your boy harry with blankets
callin her boy by name sort of con-
vinced the spunky woman although her
all right was a little doubtful

  pretty soon a ten-year-old boy comes
slippin out phil coaxes and talks to
the lad until he comes up to us and
drops the blankets but the kid dont
linger drops our new suits and fairly
skeedaddles for the house we drapes
the blankets around us and follow the
kid

  missis horner is in the door rifle
ready when she sees that were sure-
enough friends she laughs a little
shaky

  they got away with two hosses
she says referrin to the cusses who
had took our clothes but i stood em
off from the house come in

  we goes in and missis horner sets
down her gun and lights a lamp then
she takes a look at us and i be blamed
if the woman didnt set down in a chair
and laugh her head off-just laughed
until she cried

  missis horner says phil mighty
solemn this is no laughin matter
but while were talkin i want to say
that id appreciate you keepin still
about this you been wantin that big
range for some time and ill send it
out the first chance i get also you was
sayin the last time you was in town
that you wanted a sofy for your front
room but couldnt afford it the sofy
will come along with the range and no
charge for the stove or it only kindly
keep still

  the woman stuffed her apron in her
mouth and pointed at the bedroom
later she threw in some of her hus-
bands clothes and we managed to
make out

  though worn down to a frazzle we
cat-napped till midnight when i
thought it about time i lit the lamp and
looked at the clock missis horner had
loaned us

  twelve-ten i tells phil the hoo-
doos past then my mind hits back
to business tell me again i re-
quests do i get your cattle for billy
dayton 

  phil pulls up the blankets you
not only get my cattle he says just as
kind as can be but if i was runnin
goats youd get em all good night

ington restaurant where colored waiters were employed mrs cummins
after she had taken up themenu found that she had left her glasses at home and
therefore was unable to read she handed the senator the card and asked him
to order the dinner but he found that he also had forgotten his glasses

    then he handed the card to the waiter with the request

    the waiter bowed in a courtly manner and answered in a low tone

synopsis of preceding chapters

    prance wakes one morning horrified to witness the destruction of one of her prized battleships la
liberte in the harbor of toulon her powder magazines had exploded in some unaccountable manner
entirely wrecking the vessel and killing three hundred of her crew there is some baffling mystery as to
the cause of the catastrophe and three of the greatest brains in france are set on solving it-delcasse
the powerful minister of the marine lepine head of the detective bureau and crochard the invincible a
wonderful character and leader of the underworld crochard soon proves himself the master of affairs
singular things come to light first two men apparently foreigners were seen at sunrise staring at la
liberte just as the ship blew up then they disappeared all their actions proved suspicious but the
authorities cannot place hands on them deductions lead to the conviction that they were german naval
officers in disguise again wireless telegraphy seems to have played an important role in the destruction
of la liberte but how and from whence delcasse and his allies are at a loss when a most disquieting
and significant discovery is made crochard finds a secret wireless station hidden in a grove on a neighbor-
ing hill further investigation confirms the worst fears-the two foreigners are identified as germans
one of them undoubtedly pachmann head of the german wireless service crochard strikes another
mysterious trail leading him to suspect and follow the fleeing footsteps of vard a polish exile and his
daughter kasia bound for america on the liner prinzessin ottilie lepine sends an aerogram to the
commander of the speeding ship asking him if vard and daughter are on board but the answer denies
knowledge of them the french authorities are nonplused meanwhile on board the ottilie vard and
kasia are journeying in safety kasia meets an attractive frank young american dan webster and
takes him into her confidence she tells him that her father is the most wonderful man in the world and
holds the destinies of nations in the hollow of his hand dan is duly impressed but receives a momentary
shock when he discovers that their conversation on the dark deck has been overheard by his roommate
chevrial an alleged wine merchant who warns webster that it is dangerous to hold such conversations-
spies are about aboard also are pachmann and a german prince their mission being with vard who
holds the secret of destroying navies by ether waves it is pachmann who doctors the wireless message
to lepine kasia growing more friendly with dan gives into his charge the great device of her fathers
the vards being fearful of treachery meanwhile pachmann and vard hold guarded conference about the
invention and its ultimate use but it is soon apparent that their talk has been overheard by some spy
and pachmann is distraught

chapter xix

the second conference

again a rope was stretched
across the forward promenade
and for the information of the
curious a sign attached to it
bearing the single word paint
again a guard was stationed in front
of the captains cabin but this time it
consisted of two petty officers again
the captain surprised his subordinates
by mounting to the bridge although the
night was clear and fine they noticed
that he was lost in thought and that
he went often to the head of the ladder
leading to the deck and glanced down

it the second officer was on duty and
he took occasion to look down too on
one of his turns along the bridge but all
he could see was a stretch of empty
deck and two petty officers leaning
against the rail chatting together the
second officer wondered more and more
at his commanders uneasiness and sur-
reptitiously inspected the barometer
tapping it with his finger but he knew
better than to a si any questions

  meanwhile in the captains cabin
vard pachrftann and the prince again
faced each other perhaps it would be
more exact to say that vard and pach-
mann faced each other while the prince
looked on from the side lines in the

heart of that young gentleman for the
past three days there had been a strange
disgust hitherto unknown among ho-
henzollerns-the disgust of realizing
that if the truth were told he was a
poor thing who added not to the wealth
of the world but to its poverty who
was unable to support himself but to
support whom men and women and
children toiled and starved

  he had never seen it just like that
before reared in the family tradition it
had seemed a law of nature that they
should have subjects to work for them
and suffer for them and die for them
if need be he had been taught that it
was god himself who had given place
and power to his house and that if
other less-favored people lived in mis-
ery and died in want why that was
doubtless gods will too and as for
war-why without war there could be
no glory no conquest no chivalry it
was war which held a nation together
which made kings more powerful and
thrones more stable but now came a
man with shining eyes who talked of
the folly of war of the waste of armies
of universal brotherhood and a world
governed by love wild words foolish
dreams perhaps-and yet most danger-
ous to the idea of the divine right of
kings so that evening the prince sat
and listened and tried to understand

  it was pachmann who did most of
the talking and a great deal of it was
for the princes benefit

  we have been considering your pro-
posal mr vard he began and have
discussed it thoroughly as a matter
of fact he had not exchanged a word
with the prince on the subject he had
distrusted him ever since vard had of-
fered him his hand for that action
showed that this anarchist this socialist
this enemy of kings had detected in this
young descendant of kings sympathy
and a certain understanding pach-
mann thought of it with disgust and
horror we have discussed it thor-
oughly pachmann repeated and the
prince who detected the contempt in
the words flushed hotly but did not
speak and there are certain objections
to your plan which we wish to submit

to you the first of these is that war
does not depend upon explosives be-
fore gunpowder men fought with
swords and lances and arrows before
the discovery of iron and steel with
clubs and stones man has always been
fighting even when he had no weapons
but bis fists

  that is true assented vard pray
continue

  my argument is went on pach-
mann dropping the plural once for all
that though you may render all ex-
plosives useless and blow up forts and
battleships and arsenals you will not
stop war you will merely compel it
to shift to another basis-to the old
basis probably of brute strength of
hand-to-hand combat and if you do
that the old days of barbarian invasions
will return the turk will sweep down
again on southern europe the tartars
will invade us from the east you will
not assist civilization you will set it
back a thousand years it will have to
fight again for its very existence as it
did in the middle ages

  but vard shook his head

  i have thought of that he said
in the first place it will be permitted
to continue the use of explosives
against the barbarians-for defense
you understand not for aggression-
until such time as we can persuade
them too to lay down their arms as
to your other objection it falls to the
ground the moment you agree with me
that all the nations of the world must
ultimately become democracies at
first it is true men fought of their
own volition but it was to secure food
to guard their homes or to replenish
their supply of women but since those
very early days all wars have been
wars not of the people but of their
rulers they were wars of revenge or
ambition in which the people joined be-
cause they had no choice they were
driven into the ranks were sometimes
sold by one power to fight for another
left to their own choice they would
have remained quietly at home tilling
their fields rearing their families the
only great exception i know of is the
early wars of napoleon to those


the popular magazine

wars the french people did undoubt-
edly rush but they were still drunk
from the revolution and their ardor
soon passed your own people the
people of germany are a peaceable
home-loving people you have always
had to keep them under your thumb by
forced service by conscription by the
most rigorous laws you have always
had to drive them to war

  another exception occurs to me
said pachmann disregarding the last
sentence and one to which i would
call your attention since it occiyred in
a country where the people are sup-
posed to govern it was the people of
the united states who drove their
rulers into the war with spain

  that is true yard agreed and
it was a mistake the people will some-
times err when their sympathy is ap-
pealed to and their passion aroused
but the results of that war were on the
whole good a people was freed
and another enslaved said pach-
mann with a sneer

  it was already enslaved vard cor-
rected  but i admit that it was con-
tinued in slavery that was done by
the rulers not by the people had the
people been permitted to decide the
philippines would have been free no
less than cuba their independence
must of course be guaranteed when
the united states signs our treaty

  but you admit as i understand
you said pachmann returning to the
main point that to abolish explosives
will not abolish war

  i admit that yes to abolish ex-
plosives is only the first step the final
step will be the abolition of hereditary
rule

  the abolition of kings

  the abolition of kings of emperors
of czars of princes of dukes of all
tyrants great and small who by rea-
son of birth now claim the right to tax
or oppress or command even the mean-
est of their fellow creatures there
must be rulers yes but it is for the
people themselves to choose them and
then willingly to submit to them

  but you are at this moment treating
with a king pachmann pointed out

can you expect him to agree to sufch a
program

  the world has outgrown kings re-
torted vard in any event another
fifty years will see them all abolished i
but hasten the end a little-the mil-
lennium and he will be happier when
he is merely a man like other men
happiness is not the greatest thing
in the world pachmann objected

  and i say it is cried vard with
sudden violence not our own hap-
piness-no but the happiness of our
fellow creatures that is the greatest
thing in the world the thing for which
every wise and good man labors

  there was a moments silence the
prince shifted uneasily in his chair and
clasped and unclasped his hands there
had never been such talk as this in the
royal nursery

  pachmanns face was cynical as he
lighted a fresh cigar

  dreams he sneered beautiful
dreams do you know what it is you
are undertaking you are undertaking
to change human nature

  that is an old cry retorted vard
scornfully and what if i were hu-
man nature is changing every day  but
i am not undertaking to change it-i
wish merely to free human nature from
the fetters with which tyrants bind it
so that it may grow straight and strong
as god intended

  i am not acquainted with gods in-
tentions said pachmann coldly he
does not confide in me but my philoso-
phy my observation and my experience
teach me that the wise man makes the
best of things as they are accepts the
facts of life and does what he can he
sees that the world is too big for him to
overturn he realizes that there are
many things he cannot understand his
intelligence sometimes revolts at what
seems to be oppression and injustice
but he puts away from him the fallacy
that all men are equal-they are not
equal their very inequality proves it
some must rule and some be ruled for
some life must be pleasanter and more
full of meaning than it is for others 
some men must be strong and some
weak just as some women are beautiful
the destroyer



and some ugly it is not their fault it
is their misfortune and they suffer for
it which brings me to the principal
objection i have to your proposal it is
this i believe that we shall find it a
mere waste of time to invite the nations
of the world to sign a treaty for com-
plete disarmament they distrust each
other and that distrust has proved too
often to be well founded the long
centuries have made them jealous sul-
len watchful there is only one mo-
tive which can make them sign-fear-
fear of what may happen if they do
not

  i have already said remarked
vard that i am ready to apply com-
pulsion should it be necessary

  but you are finite pachmann ob-
jectedgently you are but an in-
dividual whose life may end at any mo-
ment  while as you yourself have said
this plan of yours will take long years
generations perhaps to consummate
to perfect it will test the best intellects
of the world once begun it must be
carried through do you think it wise
to imperil its success by making it de-
pend so largely on yourself besides
what would be easier than for an un-
willing nation to suppress you  a
pistol shot a blow with a knife and the
brotherhood of man tumbles to pieces

  what is it you propose  asked
vard who had listened to all this with
growing impatience

  i propose that instead of so great
a task being assumed by an individual
it be assumed by an entire nation which
shall pledge its honor to carry it to suc-
cess

  and this nation said vard sar-
castically should of course in your
opinion be germany

  i admit replied pachmann with
dignity that i consider germany best
fitted to carry out the plan i think you
will agree with me that if a single na-
tion is to undertake it it must be one
of the five great nations in world poli-
tics the others are negligible well let
us see france a nation of peacocks
excitable impressionable easily an-
gered making much of trifles jealous
of their dignity a dying nation which
a

grows smaller and weaker every year
england also a degenerate nation
soaked in gin where a hundred thou-
sand men are unemployed and where
no better remedy for pauperism can be
found than universal pensions which
only make more paupers russia an
ignorant nation whose ruling class is
composed of men without morals and
without ideals-thieves and drunkards
and vain braggarts there remains
america and at first glance it might
seem that here is the nation to be in-
trusted with the great work but after
all it is a nation of moneygrubbers
where wealth is worshiped as no other
nation worships rank a nation without
culture without experience in world
politics without self-control loudly
vain inept wasteful childish-a na-
tion in other words at the awkward age
between youth and manhood

  let us turn now to germany i
speak only what is within the knowledge
of all intelligent men when i say that
in manufacture in agriculture in the
administration of government in sci-
ence in literature in music in general
culture germany is first among na-
tions some may quarrel with her mili-
tary policy but none can question her
progress or her achievements all other
nations come to germany to learn this
is not exaggeration it is calm statement
of fact i firmly believe that to-day
intellectually morally materially ger-
many is the first nation in the world
and it is altogether fitting that she
should be chosen as the leader of the
world and arbiter of the affairs of all
nations

  vard had risen from his seat during
the discourse which was delivered with
emphasis and conviction and paced
nervously up and down the cabin his
face drawn a deep line between his
brows and pachmann watched him
curiously so did the prince watch him
wondering what he would reply he
did not leave them long in doubt

  in answer to you admiral pach-
mann he said speaking slowly and
carefully as though weighing every
word i can only say this i do not
dispute germanys great achievements


the popular magazine

no man can do that it is probably true
that in science in learning in general
culture and in efficiency she is as you
say first among nations her people
are a great people-but it is not they
whom you represent you represent a
hereditary monarch the only one in
western europe who still speaks of the
divine right of kings-a man who
would be an absolute autocrat if he
dared supporting him is a powerful
circle of hereditary nobles whose inter-
est it is to increase in every possible way
the prestige and power of the throne
at their command ready to do their
bidding is a magnificent army and a
great navy did your emperor possess
my secret he could at once declare war
against europe he could conquer eu-
rope and every german prince would
be a king my whole purpose would
be warped and debased instead of uni-
versal brotherhood we should have a
single ruling house imposing its will on
millions of conquered peoples instead
of love we should have world-wide
hate and i say to you plainly sir that
rather than that such a thing should
come to pass i will destroy my inven-
tion and leave the world as it is

  pachmann had listened intently nod-
ding his head from time to time or
puckering his brows in dissent

  have you yourself no ambition he
asked is there nothing in the way of
honor or position which you desire for
yourself or for your daughter

  an ugly sneer curled the inventors
lips

  bribery-i expected that he said
no there is nothing-nothing but the
consciousness that it was i who ended
war

  and your refusal of my first pro-
posal is absolute

  absolute i consider it insulting
you will not modify the terms of
your proposal 

  not in any essential detail

  and if germany refuses you go to
france

  that is my intention

  very well and the admiral rose
too the situation is then quite clear
to us there is no longer any shadow of

uncertainty it is for us to assent or
to refuse our answer will be ready
for you in a very short time

  vard bowed his face very pale and
stepped to the door he paused with
his hand on the knob

  remember one thing he said it
will be better for germany to lead than
to follow your emperor will find the
head of the procession much more to
his taste than the tail of it and it will
be for him either the one or the other
good night and he opened the door
and was gone

  pachmann stood with clenched fists
and flushed face staring at the spot
where vard had stood

  fool fool he muttered that
he should think he could defy and
threaten-and still escape a great
fool is he not my prince

  the prince awoke as from a dream
  great at least he said

chapter xx

the prince seeks diversion

  in spite of his protestations and the
confident manner he assumed wthen with
the prince pachmann was as a matter
of fact exceedingly disturbed it was
true that for an individual as humble as
ignace vard to hope to stand against
the might of the german empire was
absurd in the extreme but perhaps
vard was not alone perhaps back of
him there was some person or some
power at which even germany would
pause

  two incidents had been distinctly dis-
quieting the wireless from lepine and
the assault on schroeder the thing
which filled pachmann with dismay was
not so much these incidents themselves
as the degree of knowledge they indi-
cated why did lepine think vard was
on the boat how had he connected
the inventor with the disaster at tou-
lon  how had the person who as-
saulted schroeder known of the con-
ference in the captains cabin how
much had he heard of that conference
what use would he make of what he
had heard in a word did france
the desttroybtr



suspect what had happened to la
liberte and if so how much did she
know 

  a hundred times pachmann asked
himself these questions and a hundred
times tried to find some answer to them
other than the obvious answer he
tried to persuade himself that lepine
had not connected vard with the tou-
lon disaster but was searching for him
for some other reason he tried to make
himself believe that the assault on
schroeder was merely the result of a
seamans quarrel he told himself over
and over again that france could not
suspect that it was impossible she
should suspect but he could not con-
vince himself always he came back to
the obvious fact that if vard was
wanted at all it could only be for the
affair at toulon and that the man who
had taken schroeders place at the door
of the captains cabin could only have
dene so because he wanted to hear what
was passing on the other side of it

  always with sinking heart pach-
mann came back to this point and at
such moments he wondered whether
after all the emperor would not do
well to lay aside his personal ambition
to consent to vards proposal and as-
sume the leadership of this great world
movement in all good faith surely
that would be glory enough better
as vard had said to lead than to fol-
low  better to stand proudly forth at
the head of the movement than to be
whipped into place in the rear

  and suppose vard should manage to
escape suppose he should really get
into touch with france pachmann
closing his eyes could see a great
fortress leaping into the air could hear
the thunder of the explosion which de-
stroyed a dreadnaught it was a
dangerous game he was playing and
yet toaccede to vards proposal meant
the loss of alsace-lorraine meant the
eventual abasement of the hohenzol-
lerns the rise of socialism no he
could not consent he had not the
power to consent he had his instruc-
tions precise and clear from the em-
peror himself at any cost that power
must be germanys and hers alone

  at any cost pachmann drew a deep
breath he knew now what the cost
must be well when the moment came
he should not hesitate

  sunday morning found pachmann re-
side the assistant purser in the library
of the second cabin beginning the in-
quiry there it was even more drastic
than it had been in the first and the vic-
tims emerged from it heated angry and
with the fixed determination never
again to travel by a german boat
neither the captain nor the purser
could vouch for any of the undistin-
guished people here and so each one of
them was most thoroughly examined
even those with passports did not
escape pachmann examined all such
documents minutely compared the writ-
ten description point by point with the
appearance of the passenger and asked
many questions to satisfy himself that
the person presenting it was really the
one to whom it belonged yet in spite
of all this passenger after passenger
came through the ordeal successfully

  as the list was called alphabetically
it was soon the turn of monsieur chev-
rial he approached the table with con-
fidence produced his passport and sat
down to await such questions as might
be asked him pachmann glanced at
the frenchman and his eyes narrowed
with anger for this impudent person
appeared to be amused at the proceed-
ings  then he picked up the passport
and studied it carefully it had been
issued by the french government two
months previously as a renewal of a
former passport to andre chevrial
wine merchant of  rue des chan-
tiers paris whose appearance and
physical characteristics were described
in detail pachmann compared the
items of the description point by point
with the man who sat smiling so shame-
lessly before him answering the purs-
ers questions in an ironical voice the
very fact that the man was so typically
french and so plainly amused created
in pachmanns mind a flare of suspicion
which dilated his nostrils and narrowed
his eyes but the passport was in per-
fect order and chevrials answers came
without hesitation


the popular magazine

  you are a wine merchant

  yes

  how long have you been in that
business 

  more years than i cafe to remem-
ber

  that is not an answer

  let us say twenty years then
  always at paris

  the time before that did not count
then you have not been always at
paris 

  heavens no first at bordeaux
but for ten years at paris

  you are well known there

  ask my neighbors in the rue des
chantiers or cross the street to the
wine market and ask any one there if
he knows andre chevrial well
known but yes

  is this your first visit to america
oh no nor my second but it is
my first trip on a boat of germany
and will be my last on the french
boats my compatriots know me they
do not annoy me with all these ques-
tions

  it was pachmann who asked the next
one

  how does it happen that you travel
this time by a german boat

  chevrial shrugged his shoulders
because there was no french one
it is necessary that i be in new york
on wednesday there was no other
boat that wtould arrive in time had
there been  would have taken it

so you do not like german boats
i like nothing german said chev-
rial calmly least of all this inquisi-
tion which it seems to me demands
some explanation

  it is for the immigration bureau
the purser hastened to explain the
american laws are very strict

  the laws do not concern me i am
not an immigrant i am merely one
who goes on business and who returns
my papers are in order are they not

   the purser was forced to confess that
they were

  then said chevrial returning them
to his pocket if there are any further
questions to be answered i will wait
until i get to the pier at new york to

answer them i shall at least have the
pleasure of talking to an american
and he got up and left the library

  pachmann was furious but he had
no excuse for holding the fellow nor
for examining his baggage in search
of such excuse he dispatched a wireless
to the agent of his government at brus-
sels directing him to secure at once all
the information available about andre
chevrial  rue des chantiers paris
and that evening a very polite gentle-
man called at the house in- question it
was a tall hideous house with a cabaret
on the first floor to its proprietor the
visitor addressed himself but yes the
proprietor knew monsieur chevrial a
merchant of wine who had honored his
house for many years by occupying an
apartment on the third floor his pres-
ent whereabouts ah the proprietor
could not say monsieur chevrial made
many journeys in the interests of his
business he was absent at the present
time it was the season of his annual
trip to america perhaps he was now
on his way thither he had left no
address but if monsieur wished to
write a letter it would be sent forward
as soon as an address was received

  the visitor declined to write a letter
but left his card-or at least a card-
to be given to monsieur chevrial upon
his return then he took his leave
and the proprietor stuck the card in
the frame of the dirty mirror back of
the bar chuckling to himself

  a report of all which pachmann duly
received by radio next day

  the prince meanwhile was finding
the voyage wearisome he was not a
difficult person to amuse and he was
very expert in the gentle art of killing
time he had done little else since he
emerged from the nursery but here
on shipboard he possessed none of the
implements with which he usually car-
ried on that slaughter he could sit in
the smoking room with a tall stein be-
fore him he could stroll about the deck
and stare at the sea which he did not
care for but there was no one to talk
to his subjects of conversation were
limited and all of them were associated
the cdestcroyecr



moe or less with his princely charac-
ter  here where for the first time in
his life he found himself divested of
that princely character he was com-
pletely at a loss the trouble was that
he had no sense of humor-he was a
german through and through so he
found it impossible to gossip with
plebeian unknowns or engage in card
games with irreverent middle-class
artisans and drummers he could not
even carry on a flirtation with any of
the pretty girls he had attempted it
with one of them but after a very few
minutes she had left him with her chin
in the air and an exclamation which
sounded singularly like beast i what
is gallantry in a prince is impertinence
or worse in a less privileged person

  remember our prince was merely a
good-natured thick-headed young man
who had always been compelled to take
himself seriously whose life had been
ordered for him from day to day to its
minutest detail who had never been
called upon to use his wits in earnest
there had always been some one to do
his thinking for him there had always
been the routine of drill and study to fill
a certain portion of every day and
there had always been the fearful de-
light of escaping from his fathers eye
and roaming the streets of berlin in
quest of adventure but here on ship-
board jthe day was twenty-four empty
hours long arrd even pachmann had de-
serted him to spend his time asking
the passengers interminable questions
whose purpose the prince could not in
the least understand

  so on this sunday morning having
attended the services in the dining
saloon for want of something else to do
and kept awake with great difficulty
having smoked innumerable cigarettes
having snubbed an ill-mannered amer-
ican whose manner was distinctly fresh
having tramped up and down the decks
and looked into the library to find pach-
mann still asking questions questions
the prince made a sudden daring resolu-
tion walked quickly forward ascended
to the first-class promenade and looked
about for ignace vard with the in-
ventor at least he need wear no dis-

guise and he simply must talk to some-
body besides the inventors talk gave
him a good feeling at the heart-the
feeling that he might really some day
do something worth while pachmann
would disapprove of course but who
was pachmann  a younger son of the
inferior nobility he must remind
pachmann of that some day for he
seemed to have forgotten it since the
emperor had taken him up

  he found the object of his search
leaning against the rail far forward
staring ahead at the path the ship was
taking vard greeted him with evident
pleasure

  you have come to arrange for the
final conference  he asked

  the prince shook his head

  i know no more of that than you
he said

  but i was assured that your decision
would be made at once my plans de-
pend upon your answer this is sun-
day on tuesday we reach new
york

  i know nothing repeated the
prince i have not spoken with the
admiral to-day-indeed i have scarcely
spoken to him for three days on fri-
day and saturday and again to-day he
has spent every moment in an examina-
tion of the passengers

  why does he do that asked vard
quickly

  i do not know

  vard glanced at the prince and his
face softened a little

  so you have been left to amuse your-
self he said and not succeeding very
well have come to me is that it

  yes said the prince i must talk
to some one and i find that i cannot
talk with people who do not know who
i am the men offend me the women
i offend

  this time there was genuine friendli-
ness in vards face

  poor fellow he laughed well i
have never acted as court jester but im
willing to try come along

  he led the way back along the deck
and opened a door

  this is my room he said come


the popular magazine

in you should feel more at home here
than i do for it is an imperial suite
the prince assented gravely entered
and the inventor his eyes dancing
closed the door

 sit down he said you may
smoke and he proceeded to roll him-
self a cigarette this is your first
visit to america yes the first thing
you will notice is that not many amer-
icans smoke cigarettes until quite re-
cently the cigarette was believed to be
in some mysterious way debauching no
one but degenerates were supposed to
smoke them even yet that is the pre-
vailing opinion outside a few of the
large cities

 most curious commented the
prince and blew a smoke ring toward
the ceiling

  outside of new york which is
fairly cosmopolitan there is the same
prejudice against wine or beer or any
fermented or distilled spirit no pub-
lic man no teacher in a public school or
university no physician no professional
man-no man in a word who depends
upon public opinion public approval
for a livelihood-would dare sit at a
table on the sidewalk and drink a glass
of beer or a liqueur he might do it
once and escape with the reputation of
an eccentric but to do it twice would
be to brand himself as not trustworthy
astonishing said the prince do
you speak seriously 

  very seriously some of the states
have even enacted laws that no alco-
holic beverage of any kind may be sold
within their borders

  but stammered the prince staring
do you call that liberty no country
of europe would dare enact such a
law

  no it is not liberty it is govern-
ment by the majority the wonderful
thing the astonishing thing the inspir-
ing thing about it is that in this and in
all other questions the minority accepts
its defeat without grumbling and makes
the best of it that is the great lesson
which the united states has for the re-
mainder of the world and to preserve
itself it need keep no class in subjec-
tion need draft no man for service in

its armies-for it is a government
founded on the consent of the gov-
erned

  he was silent a moment considering
perhaps how to use most wisely this
opportunity

  let us apply that principle to the
other countries of the world he went
on at last let us suppose that the
people of each country were asked to
choose freely for themselves their form
of government how many of the
present governments would stand that
test  do you think the government of
germany would 

  no said the prince i suppose
not our people are all socialists so
my father says but they are not fit
to govern

  whose fault is that have you
tried to make them fit besides their
fitness or unfitness has nothing to do
with it it is their country let them
grow fit by experience but i believe
they arc fit how many of your great
men have come from humble life
oh a great many i dare say an-
swered the prince impatiently but a
body needs a head it must be gov-
erned by a head not by a stomach
ah said vard but as a matter of
fact every body is governed by its
stomach not till the stomach is satis-
fied does the head get a chance and
to govern wisely the head must be a
part of the body not something distinct
from it how is it to govern wisely if
it is not always in close touch with the
body aware of its every need it is
only when the head is distinct from the
body that it lets the body starve and
wastes its substance on vain and un-
necessary things

  i suppose said the prince with a
smile that you refer to our army and
navy

  to the army and navy of every na-
tion could the people choose how
many battleships would germany build
next year 

  the prince shrugged his shoulders
helplessly

  how can i answer such questions
i do not know but i do know that i
the cdestcroyer



have been born in a certain position
and that i must maintain it

  why vard demanded

  for the sake of my honor and the
honor of my house answered the
prince simply

 honor cried vard what do
princes know of honor is it honorable
to live on the sweat and suffering of
others and to make them no return
is it honorable to be supported by the
toil of women and children whose men
you have taken for your army is it

honorable-

  he stopped suddenly for the door
had opened and a girl came in she
stared first at one man and then at the
other evidently astonished by the few
words she had heard then she moved
to withdraw but vard stopped her

  dont go my dear he said al-
low me to present you to a prince of the
house of hohenzollern prince this is
my daughter kasia

chapter xxi

  on the education of princes

  the prince sprang to his feet and
bowed low over the hand which kasia
after an instanfs startled hesitation had
extended her father watched the scene
with an amused face

  you arrived most opportunely my
dear he said the prince being
bored as is the way with princes came
to me asking to be amused i started
out to amuse him by describing certain
strange customs of america which he
is about to visit for the first time but
i was soon on my hobby again and in-
stead of amusing him-

  you were abusing him said kasia
laughing at least it sounded so to
me

  oh not at all the prince hastened
to assure her i found what he was
saying most interesting

  but vard with that quick change of
mood characteristic of his temperament
had already decided that it was not
worth while attempting to rear any seed
from this barren soil the princes in-
tentions were good enough but they

would come to nothing-his father
would se to that

  nevertheless said vard i am not
an amusing companion i am too much
of a preacher and no one likes to be
shouted at i would suggest kasia that
you take his highness for a tour of the
deck

  the princes face brightened wonder-
fully

  that would indeed be kind he
said

  kasia looked at him with a little
smile perhaps the opportunity of talk-
ing familiarly with royalty piqued her
good democrat as she was besides he
wras not a bad-looking fellow one
could see that he was not brilliant but
he at least looked clean and honest

  if you really wish it she agreed

  for answer the prince sprang to the
door

  one moment v ard interposed
you will remember kasia that the
prince is incognito and that under no
circumstances must you betray to any
spectator or listener who he is

  i will remember father said kasia
and followed the prince out upon the
deck

  wherefore it presently came to pass
that dan webster staring gloomily
down from the after boat deck upon the
flitting beauties of the first-class prom-
enade beheld the lady of his dreams
strolling beside a well-set-up young fel-
low whose face seemed vaguely famil-
iar and in whose conversation she was
evidently deeply interested-so inter-
ested that she finally climbed with him
to a seat on the upper deck and when
they sat down dan saw that the young
fellow sat very close indeed he stared
incredulously for a moment longer and
then turned angrily away to bump
violently into monsieur chevrial who
was also staring

  what the-- dan began and then

stopped himself what right had this
frenchman to stare but then for that
matter what right had he

  chevrial was the first to recover him-
self he glanced at dans disturbed
countenance and smiled as he read his
thought


the cpocpulacr magazine

  i was surprised to see a passenger
of the second class so calmly enjoying
the privileges of the forward deck he
explained if any one was to enjoy
those privileges i should have expected
it to be you

  so he is second class i thought he
looked somewhat familiar i remember
now

  he is undoubtedly the same young
german we have seen so frequently
pacing this deck said chevrial i
fancy he is lonely and desires amuse-
ment but at the same time i fear
that you lack enterprise monsieur
webster that is not like an amer-
ican

  dan flushed and started to stalk
away but chevrial laid a hand upon his
arm

  no do not be angry with me he
said i beg your pardon it will
please you to know that that young man
yonder is one of the very few persons
on this boat with whom miss vard may
talk unconstrainedly no doubt that is
why she appears so glad to see him
with which cryptic utterance mon-
sieur chevrial went below and left dan
to bitter meditation

  kasia meanwhile was enjoying her-
self immensely

  now she said leaning back in the
seat after a glance around to assure
herself that there was no one within
hearing please tell me what it is like
to be a prince dont you get fright-
fully lonesome sometimes

  that was my complaint to-day when
i sought yotir father

  yes-but always always to stand
apart from other men and women so
that they never dare be quite open with
you quite frank with you always a lit-
tle in awe of you

  not many people i know are in awe
of me said the prince most of them
consider me something of a fool-they
do not say so but i can read it in their
faces my father thinks me a total fool
and does not hesitate to say so

  he must be a terrible man

  he is agreed the prince with con-
viction

 kasia looked at him to see if he was
in earnest then turned away her head
for an instant until she could control
her lips

  how does it happen that you speak
english so well  she asked

  my father required it it is the re-
sult of many weary hours i assure you
however added the prince i ought
not to complain since it has secured for
me the present hour

  it was the first time kasia had ever
been made the mark for a royal compli-
ment and she flushed a little in spite of
herself

  it is nice of you to say so she
murmured so you have had your
bad times too 

  bad times miss vard why the
life that i have led has been a dogs life
there were so many things that i must
know-that we all must know-so many
things we must not do i have often
gazed from the windows of the palace
and envied the boys in the gutter
not really

  oh not really of course i would
not change what i envied them was
their liberty their freedom to come and
go as it pleased them

  but since you are of age

  even yet each moment must be ac-
counted for i am now a lieutenant in
the navy and am supposed to employ
each hour profitably my father is a
very great man there are few things
that he does not know and he expects
his sons to know as much even of pic-
tures which bore me even of music
which distresses me everything is ar-
ranged at such a time i am to be
with my ship again i am to attend the
opera again i am to be present at the
opening of a museum again i must
listen to a long address which i do not
understand i may not even choose my
own wife all that is arranged

  but no doubt kasia suggested
amused at his forlorn aspect your
father will choose more wisely than you
would

  i do not know said the prince dis-
consolately i fear that he will con-
sider birth and position of more im-
portance than youth and beauty be-
the destroyer



sides there are some things a man likes
to do for himself my poor sister now

would-

  he stopped for under the stimulus
of miss vards sympathy he found
himself about to betray a family secret

  yes i can understand that said
kasia with more tenderness than she
had yet shown you dont mind my
talking frankly to you 

  i love to be talked frankly to pro-
tested the prince

  this was very far from the truth
only the prince didnt know it what
he really loved was flattery disguised as
frankness in this he resembled most
other human beings

  well then said kasia if you
dont like it if you find it intolerable
why dont you cut and run

  cut and run

  yes go away by yourself be a free
man and marry the woman you love
for of course there is such a woman
oh yes and the prince thought of
the blue-eyed daughter of the shop-
keeper in the friedrichstrasse just off
unter den linden however he had
never thought of mariage in collection
with her but suppose i should do
that he added how should i live
how do other men live by
work

  but that would be a disgrace
disgrace it isnt half so disgrace-
ful as to live by the work of other
men

  your father said something of the
same sort to me but i fear that neither
of you understand a prince cannot
do such things

  kasia threw up her hands

  so we come back to the beginning
of the circle she cried

  besides my father would not permit
it added the prince

  arent you of age

  yes-but he is the head of the fam-
ily he would have me brought home
-even from a desert island-and then
i should be confined even my elder
brother is sometimes confined-sep-
arated from his wife from his children
permitted to see no one

  poor prince said kasia so you

are a slave like the rest of us-rather
worse than the rest of us indeed is
there nothing you can do

  very few things said the prince
beginning really to pity himself you
see there is always my family to con-
sider-nothing must be done to injure
its position or to make it less popular
even my father very often may not say
what he thinks or do what he wishes
so he is a slave too

  yes in a way and it grows worse
and worse often in private he
laments the old days when a king was
really a king who was venerated and
whose word was law he grows very
angry that at each election there are
more socialists he says that the only
hope for the country is in a great war
it is for that he prepares

  how would a great war help
oh in face of the common danger
our people would forget their differ-
ences for they all love their fatherland 
they would fight shoulder to shoulder
and then when it was over they would
all be mad with joy over the victory
and there would be new provinces to
add to germany and an immense tax
levied on our enemy to pay the ex-
penses of the war so that our own peo-
ple would not have to bear that burden
it would all be just as it was after the
war with france when every german
was filled with patriotism and when
germany for the first time became one
country our house would again be
well beloved its authority unques-
tioned 

  but suppose you are defeated
wte shall not be defeated said the
prince calmly there is no nation in
the world which could defeat germany
-except perhaps the united states
but we shall not go to war with the
united states england will be our
foe and you will see her tumble to
pieces like a house of cards she is but
an empty shell

  kasia sat for a moment considering
all this if this was really what was in
the kaisers mind-and she could
scarcely doubt it-it was foolish to sup-
pose that he would consent to disarma-
ment


the popular magazine

  what you have told me is not very
promising for universal peace she said
at last

  there can be no universal peace un-
til we have humiliated england re-
plied the prince that is the belief of
all good germans the conflict must
come soon and we strain every nerve
to prepare for it i betray no secret
when i tell you this all europe
knows it england struggles also to
prepare but we are always far ahead
when we are quite ready we shall
strike then after we have won after
we have established germany as the
first nation of europe we shall be
ready for peace but we must have one
more great victory the welfare of
our house demands it

  as he spoke his eyes rested on the
top of the companionway leading from
the lower deck and he started violently
for a face had appeared there-a face
which looked at him sternly almost
threateningly it was the face of pach-
mann without a word it disappeared
the prince turned nervously to his
companion

  pardon me miss yard he said
but i must go and do not think too
seriously of my chatter i am not ad-
mitted to councils of state i know only
what every one knows we germans
we have our dreams but perhaps they
are only that

  he arose opened his lips to say some-
thing more then changed his mind
bowed and hurried away kasia stared
after him she had not seen that silent
summons but he did not look back

  an hour later pachmann with a
countenance distinctly troubled sought
out ignace vard who was reading in
his room

  the prince has been talking to your
daughter he said

  vard looked at him in stirprise

  i sent them out together he ex-
plained i thought perhaps kasia
would amuse him-and be amused

  has she told you nothing

  again vard glanced at him

 no has she reason for com-
plaint 

  i did not mean that i dare say he
behaved decently enough but he
spouted a lot of childish nonsense about
german hopes and german ambitions
and i feared your daughter might take
him seriously he is nothing but an
ignorant young ass

  vard laid aside his book and looked
pachmann full in the face

  the truth comes sometimes from the
mouths of fools he said when am i
to have my answer

  the truth is answered pachmann
readily that i am afraid to give it to
you on board this boat i chose this
boat because i believed we should be
safe here but there are spies on board
one of our conferences has been over-
heard-perhaps both of them and he
told of the assault upon schroeder
then again we must not be seen too
much together i might be recognized
and you are already suspected of having
caused the destruction of la liberte
how can that be vard demanded
in a tone which showed that he was
genuinely startled

  for answer pachmann took from his
pocketbook a paper unfolded it and
handed it to vard it was the wireless
from lepine

  that was received last thursday
he said i suppose you know who
lepine is by great good fortune i
intercepted it and sent an answer de-
nying that you were on board it was
for that reason you were removed to
the first class and your name kept off
the passenger list but how can he have
suspected you

  yard shook his head slowly he was
a little pale and the hand which held
the message trembled

  i cannot guess he said

  you have told no one

  told flashed vard do you not
see that unless my great plan succeeds
that action will have been an infamous
one to kill three hundred men in or-
der to assure peace to the world-that
may be justified-that may even be
heroic but to kill them wantonly to kill
them and then to fail-that would drive
me mad he looked at pachmann his
eyes suddenly inflamed and let me
the tdesto yecr



tell you this he added in a voice of
concentrated passion if i find that you
have deceived me if i find that you
have betrayed me germany shall suffer
a reprisal that will make you shudder
i swear it

  pachmanns eyes were also suffused
in that moment he literally saw red

  you threaten he cried hoarsely
you dare to threaten

  i warn said vard and you will
do well to heed the warning you are
playing with fire-take care that it does
not consume you

  pachmann conquered his emotion by
a supreme effort

   it is foolish to talk in that way he
said it is foolish to speak of decep-
tion and betrayal there is no question
of either but we must move cau-
tiously we must evade these spies
even you can see that

  here is my last word said vard
more calmly we shall reach new
york on tuesday i will await your
answer for twenty-four hours after we
have landed if i have not then re-
ceived it i shall consider myself free
to act as i think best

  a gleam of triumph flashed in pach-
manns eyes

  i accept your condition he said
with a little ironical bow rose and left
the cabin

chapter xxii

the events of monday

  kasia did not see the prince again
that ingenuous young manhad spent a
most uncomfortable half hour with the
doughty admiral whose language had
been both lucid and emphatic and who
had opened the discussion and spiked
the princes guns at the very start as it
were by producing the paper sealed
with the imperial seal

  i would call your attention espe-
cially to this clause said pachmann
and placed his finger upon the words
all members of my familyit was
not placed there by accident i assure
you you understand its meaning
the prince nodded sullenly as he
handed the paper back

  your father pachmann continued
replacing it in his pocket foresaw that
some difficulty such as this might arise
as you know his confidence in you is
not great

  the prince flushed and opened his
lips angrily but closed them again
without speaking

  pachmann smiled unpleasantly

  i can guess what you wish to say
he said you would remind me that
you are a hohenzollern a prince of the
blood a scion of the house to which i
a petty member of the inferior nobility
owe allegiance that i do not permit
myself to forget but in this affair by
virtue of this paper i stand in place of
your royal father he would not hes-
itate to rebuke you and neither shall i
what was it you were saying to miss
vard

  and the prince after a moments in-
ward struggle repeated the conversa-
tion while pachmann listened frown-
ingly

  you have been most indiscreet he
said severely when the prince had fin-
ished how much harm you have
done i cannot say-but i must hasten
to undo it i do not understand you
you know how important this affair is
-you are a good german-and yet
you go about talking in this fashion  it
is enough to drive one mad if your
father learned of it - fear he would
think it necessary to punish you with
great severity i shall not report it-
but on one condition  you must give me
your word to discuss affairs of state
with no one to make no chance ac-
quaintances and to see this girl or her
father only in my presence

  and so deeply grounded was the habit
of obedience so profound his respect
even for his fathers signature that the
prince promised besides he had no
wish to spend a year or more in some
second-rate fortress and he resolved to
watch himself most warily until this
annoying business was at an end and
he was back again in berlin

  so kasia saw him no more she had
a little struggle with herself before she
finally decided that it was her duty to
outline the princes confessions to her


the popular magazine

father and she was deeply relieved
when he waved them aside as of no im-
portance

  every one knows he said that
germany dreams of nothing but humil-
iating england that is no secret-it has
been the talk of europe for ten years
past but it is one of those dreams
which never come true-or go by con-
traries 

  by noon of monday pachmann had
completed his scrutiny of the passen-
gers and sought an interview with the
captain

  i have discovered nothing he said
absolutely nothing at one time i
thought that i had the man but i
caused his story to be investigated and
found that it was true there remains
only one thing to be done at what
hour shall we land

  that will depend upon the delay at
quarantine two of our steerage pas-
sengers are ill we may not be able to
dock before evening

  pachmann considered this for a mo-
ment

  in the first place he went on at
last following out his thought you
must secure for me two landing tickets
-one for vard and one for his
daughter the immigration officer must
not see them there must be no evidence
that they ever reached new york
hausmanns face clouded

  that is a very serious offense he
pointed out

  we must take the risk

  what will you do about their bag-
gage 

  i will have it claimed by some one
from the consulate

  the captain hesitated yet a moment

  i will secure the tickets he agreed
finally a considerable outlay will be
necessary

  you will be reimbursed further-
more pachmann added i will myself
explain to the emperor how greatly you
have assisted us

  captain hausmann bowed coldly

  is there anything else he asked
  you have watched the wireless
  yes

  it must be watched even more
closely no message in cipher nor any
that is at all questionable must be sent
or delivered if there are complaints
afterward the failure can he explained
as an oversight

  again hausmann bowed

  and finally said pachmann i
have here a message which i would ask
you to have sent at once

  it was in cipher and a long one and
it took half an hour to transmit for the
wireless man at the block island sta-
tion was required to repeat it for veri-
fication then it was hurried on by
telegraph to new york and finally de-
livered at the gernian consulate where
the chief of the german secret service
to whom it was addressed read it with
great care

  miss vard meanwhile was finding
the hours long the prince had fur-
nished a slight divertisement the day be-
fore  but to-day there was no such re-
lief in sight and she found herself
singularly restless this was in part
a reflection of her fathers mood for
she had never known him so nervous
and irritable the lines in his face had
deepened his eyes were brighter than
ever and he waved her impatiently
away whenever she ventured to ad-
dress him plainly a crisis was at hand
and as she saw how her father was
affected she awaited it with foreboding

  she tried to read and gave it up for
she could not fix her attention on the
page she sat for a long time looking at
the sea and then turned her eyes away
for its restlessness increased her own
she went for a walk about the deck but
it seemed to her in every pair of eyes
turned upon her there was suspicion and
aversion how glad she was that the
voyage was almost ended it had
started happily enough and then quite
suddenly it had become wearisome and
hateful

  it was inevitable that at this point
her thoughts should fly to dan what
a nice boy he was she would see him
to-morrow night-she had promised
him that and before that would
it be too undignified for her to steal up
the destroys



again to that bench on the after boat
deck-would it-would it precipitate
njatters she did not want to do that

and yet-

  good afternoon said a voice and
some one fell into step beside her and
she looked up and saw that it was dan
for an instant she fancied it was only
the vizualization of her own thoughts
then she winked the mists away

  this is nice of you she said i
was just wishing for-some one i
was dreadfully bored

  you were a thousand miles away i
passed you twice and you didnt even
see me if it hadnt been for my news-
paper training id have run away to my
den

  im very glad you didnt i really
wanted to talk to you

  suppose we go up on the boat deck

said dan where you-

  he stopped

  where i what

  dan led the way up the ladder with-
out replying but a gleam of under-
standing penetrated miss vards mind
when she saw him go straight to the
bench where she and the prince had
sat

  it was this way dan explained sit-
ting down beside her i happened to
be staring down at the forward prom-
enade yesterday afternoon when i saw
you walking with a tall young fellow
who seemed exceedingly interested in
you naturally i was a little curious
as he happened to be a second-class

passenger like myself-

  second class broke in kasia and
stopped herself

  did you think him a millionaire
queried dan a little bitterly

  no answered kasia quietly i
thought him just what he is-an ingenu-
ous young german not very brilliant
perhaps but clean and honest i passed
a very pleasant half hour with him
dans face was a little pale but he
looked at her manfully and squared his
shoulders

  i deserved that he said thank
you miss vard but it was very
lonely last night

  kasias look softened

  yes she agreed it was

  you have felt it too asked dan
his face lighting up again

  certainly i have felt it i havent
dared make any friends among the first-
class passengers and a person cant read
all the time one likes to talk occa-
sionally no matter with whom

  why not slip over to second class
to-night dan suggested and sit on
the bench the moon is very beauti-
ful

  but kasia shook her head smiling

  i shall have to admire it alone she
said we must not be seen so much
together-it is not wise for us to sit
here suppose some one seeing us to-
gether should take it into his mind to
search your baggage and should find

that little package-

  he wouldnt find it dan broke in
during the day i carry it in my
pocket at night i sleep with it under
my pillow

  kasia gave him a quick glance

  that is splendid she said quickly
and you dont even wish to know
what it is 

  not unless you wish to tell me
there is one danger though if the
customs inspector should happen to run
across it he will want to know what
it is

  tell him it is an electrical device
  and if he opens it

  that will do no harm all he will
find is a small metal box filled with
tiny wires coiled about each other
dan breathed more freely

   that simplifies things he said
from what you said when you gave
it to me i was afraid i might have to
knock him down snatch the package
and make a break for it

  no and kasia smiled it would
appear of value only to some one who
knew what it was the customs inspec-
tor doesnt count

  and to-morrow evening say at eight
oclock i shall bring it up to you
very well i shall expect you and
now you must go

  dan rose obediently

  it will be a long twenty-four hours
he said but i feel more cheerful than


the popular magazine

i did by the way he added turnirig
back theres one thing i forgot to tell
you if that other young fellow shows
up again you neednt be afraid to talk
to him chevrial says hes about the
only one on the ship you are safe to
talk freely with

  chevrial she repeated staring
chevrial said that

  yes and dan laughed he seems
to be the wise guy all right and with-
out suspecting her emotion he turned
and left her but for a long time kasia
sat there unmoving trying to under-
stand

  dans evening was not so lonely as he
had expected for as he sat on the
bench on the boat deck staring out
across the water and thinking of the
morrow chevrial joined him

  i do not intrude the frenchman
asked

  not at all sit down wont you
chevrial sat down and for some mo-
ments there was silence

  our voyage nears an end monsieur
webster chevrial said at last to-
morrow you will be home again per-
haps i may gee you in new york
where will you stay

  i have some friends in the wine
trade with whom i usually stay the
little money i pay them is welcome to
them and i am more comfortable than
at a hotel i do not know their exact
address-they have moved since i was
last here but they are to meet me at the
pier

  whenever you have a leisure even-
ing said dan call up the record of-
fice and ask for me and we will have
dinner together

  thank you i shall remember and
i should like you to meet my friends i
do not know if you are a connoisseur
of wine but if you are they possess a
few bottles of a vintage that will delight
you

  im far from being a connoisseur
dan laughed but i accept the invita-
tion with thanks

  chevrials face was bright

  and when next you come to paris
he added i hope you will let me know

there is my card a letter to that ad-
dress will always reach me-we have no
telephone alas there are some things
i should delight to show you-things
which the averagevisitor does not see
you are very kind said dan tak-
ing the card and i shall not forget
though i dont expect to get abroad
again very soon you see i have to
collect a reserve fund first and the
cost of living is high

  whenever it is and the more soon
the better i shall be pleased

 how long will you be in new
york

  a week-ten days perhaps then i
go to boston and to montreal and
quebec and thence home again i am
glad i shall not have to use a german
boat i do not like german boats-nor
anything german for the matter of
that which reminds me of a most pe-
culiar circumstance you may have
wondered at my remark with reference
to that young man who was strolling
with miss vard

  that she could talk with him with-
out fear yes i have wondered just
what you meant by it	

  i may be mistaken-but i should like
your judgment in the library among
the other books is one which describes
the life of the kaiser and his family-
it is put there i suppose for all good
germans to read it is illustrated by
many photographs in looking at the
photographs one of them impressed me
as curiously familiar if i should hap-
pen to be correct it would make a most
startling article for your newspaper
but i wish you to judge for yourself
you will find the book lying on the
table in the library and the photograph
in question is on page ninety-eight if
you will look at it and then return here
i should consider it a favor

  considerably astonished dan de-
scended to the library found the book
and turned to page ninety-eight yes
there was a photograph of the emperor
with the empress and princess vic-
toria  another of the crown prince with
his wife and children another of the
princes-eitel-frederick august os-
car adalbert-
the destroyer



  and dan looking at it felt his eye-
balls bulge for he found himself gaz-
ing at the face of kasia vards com-
panion

  he told himself he was mistaken
closed his eyes for an instant and then
looked again there was certainly a
marvelous resemblance if it should
really be the same-dans head whirled
at thought of the story it would make t
he closed the book at last climbed
slowly back to the boat deck and sat
down again beside monsieur chevrial

  well asked the latter what do
you think of it

  if they are not the same man they
are remarkably alike said dan

  i believe they are the same

  but it seems too grotesque why
should a hohenzollern travel second
class dressed in a shabby walking suit
and without attendants

  there is a middle-aged german with
him who is no doubt his tutor or
guardian or jailer-whichever you may
please to call it

  his jailer

  chevrial smiled

  the emperor is a father of the old
school and punishes his sons occasion-
ally by imprisonment or banishment un-
der guard i fancy that is the case here
before i left paris i heard rumors of
indiscretions on the princes part with
a young lady in berlin which had made
his father very angry at least it is
worth investigating

  it certainly is agreed dan wrarmly
and fell silent pondering how best to
prove or disprove  this extraordinary
story it was decidedly of the sort the
record liked if he could only verify
it his return to the office would be in
the nature of a triumph but to prove
it well there were ways 

  a low exclamation from his com-
panion brought him out of his thoughts

  behold said chevrial and far
away to the right dan caught the gleam
of a light

  a ship he asked

  no no it is the lighthouse on what
you call the island of fire it is amer-
ica welcoming you my friend

  and dan with a queer lump in his
throat took off his cap

  america he repeated and kasia
vards words leaped into his mind
the land of freedom

  yes agreed his companion softly 
you do well to be proud of her she
is at least more free than any other 

chapter xxiii

the landing

 when dan webster awoke next
morning his first thought was that
something was wrong and it was a mo-
ment before he realized what it was
the screw had stopped instead of
quivering with the steady pulselike vi-
bration to which during the past week
he had grown accustomed the ship lay
dead and motionless he got on deck
as quickly as he could and found that
they were anchored in the shelter of
sandy hook with a boat from quaran-
tine alongside already the deck was
thronged with excited passengers  many
of the women in their eagerness to go
ashore had put on their hats and veils
and even their gloves but word got
about that there was some sickness in
the steerage and that it would probably
be some hours before they could pro-
ceed

  dan took a long look at the familiar
land then he hurried below to break-
fast he had planned his campaign be-
fore he went to sleep the previous night
and he was eager to begin it break-
fast therefore did not take him long
and he was soon searching the decks
for the man who possibly was a son
of the kaiser but much more prob-
ably merely a young german who made
the most of a chance resemblance

  dan possessed the aplomb which only
years of work on a great paper can give
a man he had wormed interviews from
many reluctant and exalted personages
he had asked questions which the other
man was certain to resent often quite
justly he had drilled himself to be-
lieve that when he was on the trail all
mankind was fair game and that any
device which would drag the truth from


the popular magazine

them was justified-the truth the truth
that was the end and the justification
of newspaper methods nevertheless
his heart beat a little faster when at
last he perceived the object of his
search leaning against the rail at the
rear of the upper promenade and gaz-
ing out to sea

  ive got buck fever he told himself
its because im out of training and
then he wondered if the prince was
thinking of germany and of the lady-
love from whom he had been torn

  nobody else apparently had any
thought for germany or for the open
sea every one had crowded to the side
rails to stare at the land or at the
smudge of smoke which marked long
island and the stern of the ship was
deserted telling himself that he would
never have a better chance and that he
must finish writh the affair before the
ship reporters came aboard dan braced
himself approached the solitary and
somewhat pathetic figure removed his
cap and bowed respectfully the
prince abruptly awakened from his
daydreams looked up with a start and
met dans smiling eyes with an aston-
ished stare

  i see your highness does not remem-
ber me said dan good-humoredly
that is not remarkable but i was con-
ceited enough to think it just possible
that you might

  no said the prince finding his

tongue i fear i do not- he

stopped abruptly for whom do you
take me he demanded

  surely i am not mistaken and dan
looked at him more closely then he
burst into a laugh no-it is really
your highness  i cannot be deceived 

  the prince met his gaze and shook his
head and tried to laugh but he was
not a good liar-his father had long
since recognized his unfitness for any
diplomatic mission

  i see it is useless for me to dissem-
ble he said in a low tone but i am
here strictly incognito and i beg that
you will not betray me where have we
met 

  dans heart leaped with exultation
and then a little feeling of shame seized

him it was too bad to have to betray
the fellow-but duty demanded it
perhaps however it could be done in
a way that would not be offensive he
opened his lips to explain when a stocky
figure suddenly thrust itself between
them and dan found himself gazing
into a pair of irate gray eyes

  what is this demanded the new-
comer though his voice too was care-
fully lowered who are you sir
dan felt his good resolutions poze
away at the others brutal manner

  i am a reporter he said

  what is your business

  gathering news

  your business here i mean

  i was just interviewing the prince
explained dan blandly the record
would be very glad to have his opinion
of the moroccan situation of the
italian war of the triple entente or of
anything else he cares to talk about
perhaps he could find a theme in the de-
struction of la liberie

  he spoke at random and was sur-
prised to see how fixedly the other man
regarded him with eyes in which appre-
hension seemed to have taken the place
of anger

  one moment said pachmann for it
was he and he turned and spoke a few
rapid words of german to the prince
who reddened and nodded sullenly
dan judged from the sound of the ad-
mirals subsequent remarks that he was
swearing but he preserved a pleasant
countenance the more easily since hap-
pening to glance up he saw chevrial
leaning over the rail of the boat deck
just above them and regarding the
scene with an amused smile at last
having relieved his feelings the admiral
fell silent and pulled absently at the
place where his mustache had been

  when does your paper appear
pachmann asked at last

  to-morrow morning

  you would not wish to use the in-
terview before that time

  no

  pachmann breathed a sigh of relief
and his face cleared

  then we are prepared to make a
bargain with you he said it is most
the destroyecr



important that the princes incognito be
strictly preserved until to-night if you
will give me your word of honor to say
nothing of this to any one until eight
oclock this evening i in return give
you my word of honor that the prince
at that hour will grant you an inter-
view which i am sure you will find of
interest do you agree

  dan reflected rapidly that he had
nothing to lose by such an agreement
that eight oclock would release him
from his promise in ample time to write
his story and the interview might really
be important

  yes he said i agree but on one
condition

  what is that demanded pachmann
impatiently

  that the interview be exclusive
exclusive echoed pachmann i
do not understand

  i mean by that that no one else
is to get the interview but me dan
explained-

  a sardonic smile flitted across pach-
manns lips

  i agree to the condition he said
and you on your part agree to say no
word to any one you are not to men-
tion the appointment which i will make
with you

  i understand said dan but in-
terview or no interview i am to be re-
leased from the promise at eight
oclock

  yes very well then i accept
your word of honor and i give you
mine at seven oclock to-night you
will call at the german consulate and
ask for admiral pachmann i shall be
in waiting to conduct you to the prince
i thank you said dan and walked
away treading on air then another
consideration occurred to him all this
vas going to interfere with his evening
with kasia he must see her and ex-
plain that he would be late but an of-
ficial stopped him at the gangway and
explained that under quarantine reg-
ulations each class must keep to its own
quarters until the boat had docked

  the delay was less than had been
feared for the illness in the steerage
ioa

  turned out to be well-defined typhoid
so at the end of two hours the big
ship began to move slowly up the har-
bor with the passengers hanging over
the rails for the first glimpse of the
great city there was the green shore
of long island and then the hills of
staten island and then there to the
left loomed the statue of liberty her
torch held high dan took off his cap
his eyes moist and then as he glanced
at the faces of his neighbors he saw
that they were all gazing raptly at the
majestic figure just as he had been
most of them no doubt had seen it
many times before some of them per-
haps had committed the sacrilege of
climbing up into the head and scribbling
their names there they had glanced at
her carelessly enough outward-bound
for europe but now she had for all of
them - new meaning-she typified the
spirit of their fatherland she welcomed
them home

  and finally the wonderful sky line of
new york towered far ahead the web-
like structure of the brooklyn bridge
spanning the river to the right little
clouds of steam crowning with white
the summits of the towering buildings
and a million windows flashing back the
sunlight there is nothing else in the
whole world like it and the thousand
passengers on the upper decks coming
home and the thousand men and
women crowded on the lower deck
seeking fortune in a strange land-all
alike gazed and marveled and were
glad

  then with half a dozen tugs pushing
and pulling and straining and panting
the ship swung in toward her dock and
soon she was near enough for those on
board to see the faces of the waiting
crowd and there were cries of greet-
ing and wavings of handkerchiefs and
the shedding of happy tears-for it is
good to get home and at last the great
hawsers were flung out and made fast
and the voyage was ended

  at this moment as at all others the
first-cabin passengers had the prece-
dence and filed slowly down one gang-
plank their landing tickets in their
hands while at another the stewards

                         i


the popular magazine

  proceeded to yank off the hand baggage
dan leaning over the rail watched the
long line of passerfgers surging slowly
forward and finally he saw kasia and
her father he would see them on the
pier of course for it would take them
some time to get their baggage through
and he could explain to kasia about the
other engagement he followed them
with his eyes-and then with a gasp of
astonishment he perceived just behind
them also moving slowly down the
gangplank the prince and the man who
had called himself admiral pachmann

  but those men could have nothing to
do with kasia it was just an accident
that they happened to be behind her
and then he grasped the rail and
strained forward scarcely able to be-
lieve his eyes for pachmann had
spoken to vard who nodded and
walked hurriedly on with him while
kasia with a mocking smile tucked her
hand writhin the princes arm and fell
into step beside him along the pier
they hastened to the entrance gates
gave up their tickets passed through
and were lost in the crowd outside

  dan stood staring after them for yet
a moment then with the careful step
of a man who knows himself to be in-
toxicated he climbed painfully to the
boat deck dropped upon a bench there
and took his head in his hands

  there half an hour later the steward
found him

  beg pardon sir he said are you
ill

  dan looked up dazedly

  no he said why

  the passengers are all off sir if
you have any luggage youd better be
having it examined sir

  thank you said dan and got to
his feet descended to the lower deck
and went unsteadily down the gang-
plank

  the pier was littered with baggage
and crowded with distracted men and
women watching the inspectors diving
remorselessly among their tenderest
possessions each was absorbed in his
own affairs and none of them noticed
dans slow progress toward the little
office of the chief inspector after a

  short wait an inspector was told off to
look through his baggage and with
dans declaration in his hand led the
way to the letter w where his two
suit cases were soon found dan un-
locked them and stood aside while the
inspector knelt and examined their con-
tents he was through in ten minutes

  nothing here he said and rose
then his eyes ran dan up and down
i see you have a small parcel in your
coat pocket may i see it

  without a word dan handed him the
parcel the inspector turned it over
and examined the seals

  whats in it  he asked

  a little electrical device dan an-
swered

  well ill have to open it-it might
be diamonds for all i know

  go ahead said dan and the in-
spector broke the seals unwrapped the
paper and disclosed a small pasteboard
box he lifted the lid glanced inside
and then looked at dan

  what is this a joke he de-
manded

  i dont understand dan stam-
mered

  you said it was an electrical device

  thats what it is

  either youre crazy or i am said
the man and i dont think its me
and he thrust the box under dans nose

  and dans eyes nearly started from
his head for the box contained a cake
of soap cut neatly to fit it into which
had been pressed a number of nickel
coins

chapter xxiv

pachmann scores

  dan webster never had any definite
recollection of how he got to his rooms
somebody must have carried his bags
to a cab and put them and him inside
it and he must have given the cabby the
number of the apartment house where
his rooms were for after a certain time
he found himself in a cab which had
stopped in front of it with marshall
the doorman staring in at him

  i think hes drunk thats what i
think said the cabby who had got
the destoye



clown suspecting that his services would
be needed he ought to be put to bed
and left to sleep it off

  i dont understand it said mar-
shall i never saw him like this be-
fore paris must surely be an awful
place

  the cabby chuckled and together
they got dan out and into the elevator
but when the doorman had paid and
dismissed the cabby and tried to follow
his advice he met writh unexpected op-
position

  go away marshall and leave me
alone said dan i heard what that
fellow said  but im not drunk-though
i dont doubt i look it just go away
and shut the door ill thank you an-
other time theres a good fellow 

  and in the end marshall went doubt-
fully away

  dan went to work at himself imme-
diately with mechanical thoroughness
he filled his tub with cold water un-
dressed and plunged into it dipping his
head under half a dozen times then
he rubbed down with the roughest towel
he could find gave himself a vigorous
massage from head to feet took a sharp
turn with a pair of dumb-bells got into
fresh clothes and began to feel more
like himself

  there he said thats better now
lets see if this thing is real or only a
nightmare

  he went to his coat got out the paste-
board box placed it on a table sat down
before it and carefully removed the lid

  no it was not a nightmare there
was a cake of soap-pink scented soap
-weighted with the nickel coins pois-
ing the box in his hand he understood
why the coins had been added with-
out them the box would have been too
light he pulled one of the coins out
and looked at it it was a german piece
of twenty pfennigs such as any one on
the ship might have used he put it
carefully back and lay down on his bed
to reason the thing out

  how had the substitution been made 
how could it have been made every
day the box had been in his pocket
every night it had been beneath his pil-
low there was only one explanation-

the change must have been made while
he was asleep some one had entered
the stateroom slipped out the other box
with a cautious hand and substituted
this one whoever it was must have
been familiar with the weight of the
other box and with the way it was
wrapped and sealed but how was that
possible no one could have seen miss
vard give it to him no one could have
known that he had it

  and then dan sat suddenly erect
chevrial might have known chevrial
might have seen him slip it into his
pocket as he dressed yes chevrial
might have done it who was chev-
rial how should a wine merchant
know so much about spies and diplo-
macy and german princes there had
always been about him an air of power
of reserve force which had impressed
dan yes and an air of mystery-the
air of one who knows a great many
things he does not choose to tell

  chevrial was undoubtedly a spy him-
self

  and as he found this answer dan
wondered that it had not occurred to
him long before for it furnished the
clew upon which chevrials words and
hints and looks and warnings were
strung together as on a thread

  there could be no doubt about it
chevrial was a spy engaged in some
desperate plot-no ordinary plot for a
prince and admiral of the german em-
pire were also engaged in it and
heaven alone knew how many others

  there was one thing to be done at
once he must go to kasia vard and
confess that he had been outwitted
and he trembled as he thought what
the loss of that little box would mean
to her why had he been so dense
why had he not suspected-

  telling himself that self-accusation
would do no good he finished dressing
hurriedly let himself out and ran
downstairs without waiting to call the
elevator at the front door he met
marshall whose face brightened at
sight of him

  so youre all right again sir he
said im glad of that

  yes and dan slipped a bill into his


the popular magazine

hand i had a little shock that sort of
upset me many thanks for looking
after me marshall ill not forget it
thats all right sir thank you sir
hope you had a good time

  splendid come up and see me to-
morrow i brought a little memento
for you from that awful place called
paris and leaving marshall staring
he ran down the steps to the street
sought the nearest subway station and
twenty minutes later mounted the steps
of the house on west sixty-fourth
street whose address kasia had given
him-a quiet house in a quiet neighbor-
hood his finger was trembling as he
touched the bell how should he ever
face her

  a colored boy answered the ring

  i wish to see miss vard at once
said dan and produced a card

  miss vard is not here sir

  not here has she gone out
no sir shes been to europe and
aint got back yet

  dan steadied himself against the wall
for he felt a little dizzy again

  i know but she must be back
her boat docked three or four hours
ago

  we was expectin her to-day sir-
her and her father but they aint got
here yet

  dan looked at the boy for a moment
then he gave him a silver dollar

  are you sure he asked

  yes sir im sure and dan could
see that he was telling the truth

  have you a phone

  oh yes sir

  whats its number

  the boy told him and dan jotted it
down

  will you give the card to miss vard
as soon as she arrives he asked

  yes sir ill do that

  dan wrote a hasty line on the card
asking kasia to call him at once and
added his telephone number

  its those germans dan muttered
to himself theyve got her into it
somehow

  and then suddenly he remembered
his appointment and snatched out his
watch it was nearly six oclock

  ill drag it out of them he said
ill drag it out of them and if chev-

rials there-

  he stopped chevrial and the ger-
mans could not be in collusion-such an
alliance was unthinkable but howt else

to explain it-

  dan gave it up but a good dinner
at a near-by restaurant restored him
something of his self-confidence if it
did not enable him to see any farther
into the mystery after all this was
america europe might be honey-
combed with intrigue and overrun with
spies but they would find their occupa-
tion gone on this side the water and
he himself would explode a bomb in
the mornings record that would shake
them up a little so it was a fairly
confident and self-controlled young man
who mounted the steps of the german
consulate at five minutes to seven a
flunky in livery opened the door to his
ring

  i have an appointment with ad-
miral pachmann said dan with a
sudden cold fear at his heart that he
would be laughed at but instead he was
shown at once into a little antechamber

  sit here a moment sir said the
footman and hastened away closing the
door behind him but it opened almost
at once and pachmann himself entered

  pachmann fairly radiated good hu-
mor all his roughness of the morn-
ing had disappeared and he greeted
dan beamingly

  i am most gladto see you he said
in such a tone that dan almost believed
him you are prompt-but that i am
given to understand is an american
virtue however i am prompt also
the car is waiting

  the car dan echoed

  you will understand pachmann
explained that since the prince is in-
cognito it is impossible for him to re-
main at the consulate-that would at
once betray him i was uncertain this
morning as to our arrangements or i
should have directed you to the proper
address however it is but a step
and he opened the door

  dan followed him along a handsome
hall to the carriage entrance where
the destcroyecr



at the foot of the steps stood a limou-
sine

  enter my dear sir said pachmann
and followed him into the car the
door slammed the driver sprang to his
seat and they were off in the semi-
darkness dan fancied he heard a re-
pressed chuckle and a vague uneasi-
ness stole upon him but he shook it
off what had he to fear

  you will remember said pach-
mann finally that this interview is not
a thing which we desire but to which
we consent because we must you
placed us this morning in a very awk-
ward position you newspaper men of
america have a method all your own
the manner in which you entrapped
the prince compels my admiration
how did you know that it was he
there was a book on the ship with
a history and portraits of the royal
family dan explained

  so said pachmann and there was
a note of surprise in his voice which
told dan definitely that whatever chev-
rials plot might be this german was
not in it you have sharp eyes but
the likeness may have been merely a
chance one it must have seemed most
strange to you that a prince of the em-
pire should travel alone as a passenger
of the second class

  it did that was why i approached
him as i did

  it was most clever we admit it
ah here we are

  the car had stopped and pachmann
opened the door as dan alighted he
glanced up and down the street but did
not recognize it it was a street of
close-built apartment houses and private
dwellings like any one of hundreds in
new york pachmann crossed the
pavement mounted the steps and
touched the bell the door was opened
instantly by a tall servant in livery

  if dan had expected it to reveal a
regal magnificence he was disap-
pointed the hall into which he stepped
was simply even meagerly furnished
without pausing pachmann mounted
the stair and led the way into the front
room on the upper floor it was a large
room lighted only by the glow of a

wood fire a man was sitting in front
of it and sprang up at their entrance
pachmann at the door switched on the
electrics

  my dear prince he said i have
brought the young gentleman for the in-
terview which we promised him

  and dan as he saw the others face
breathed a sigh of relief yes it was
the prince for a moment he had
feared that he was being tricked pach-
mann had undoubtedly chuckled

  the prince bowed coldly his face
was very gloomy-in striking contrast
to pachmann which was beaming
more than ever with good humor

  i feel that an apology is due your
highness said dan for the way in
which i sought to entrap you this morn-
ing please believe that i was about
to promise to do what i could to re-
spect your incognito when this gentle-
man intervened in my article for to-
morrow i shall try to say nothing that
can offend you

  i thank you said the prince
gravely

  all this is wasting time broke in
pachmann impatiently proceed with
your questions my young sir

  what is the purpose of your high-
ness visit to america asked dan

  the prince hesitated and glanced at
pachmann

  perhaps it would be best for the ex-
planation to come from me said the
latter smoothly but with a sardonic
smile upon his face the prince trav-
els in search of health he is of a
most studious disposition-sits up with
his books far into the night-becomes
so absorbed in them that he forgets to
go to bed even to eat so the em-
peror in fear that he would injure his
health-you can see by looking at him
he is most delicate-decreed a trip
around the world made incognito in the
simplest fashion during which he was
not so much as to look inside a book
this accounts for the fact that never
once on the voyage over did you see
him with a book in his hand that is
the whole mystery my young sir

  dan glancing at the prince saw that
he was red with anger but he could not


the popular magazine

repress a smile at the absurdity of
pachmanns explanation the prince
was evidently as strong as an ox and
had anything but the appearance of a
student

 you may have heard some idle
tales went on pachmann rubbing his
hands with pleasure of a low affair-
of a barmaid perhaps berlin is al-
ways full of such gossip and you amer-
ican journalists hear it all but believe
me it is merely gossip the truth is as i
have told you

  the prince had wheeled upon pach-
mann his eyes blazing

  it is too much he cried in ger-
man you insult me and you shall
answer for it i warn you and he
strode to the door

  farewell my prince said pach-
mann mockingly and waited with a
sneer on his lips until the princes
heavy footsteps died away down the
hall then he turned back to dan
behold that princes have rages just as
other men he said

  i dont blame him said dan i
wonder he didnt knock you down
so and pachmanns eyes took an
ugly gleam i fear the interview is at
an end

  i have another question to ask said
dan quietly where are mr vard
and his daughter 

  pachmanns eyes narrowed to mere
slits and his face became positively
venomous

  i was expecting that question he
sneered what do you know of vard
and his daughter

  they are friends of mine i saw
them leave the pier with you they
have not yet reached their apartment
where are they

  i cannot tell you

  you mean you will not

  put it that way if it pleases you

  a storm of rage was hammering in
dans brain

  i would advise you to tell me he
said tensely

  you threaten  

  yes and dan took a step toward
the admiral i would advise you to
tell me

  pachmann did not stir he glanced
with ironic eyes from dans white face
to his working fingers then he threw
back his head and laughed

  but this is better fortune than i de-
serve he mocked i did not know i
did not suspect-even when the girl told
me then his mood changed his lips
curled his eyes flashed fire what a
fool he sneered wthat a fool you
thrust yourself upon us-you walk into
our trap-you are wholly in our power
-and yet you think to frighten me with
your grand air and your twitching
hands bah to me you are merely
a speck of dust to be blown aside-so
now more than ever as an ignorant
young fool who knew no better i
might perhaps in time have let you go
but now-

  the anger had ebbed from dans
brain although his attitude had not re-
laxed staring into pachmanns leer-
ing face he realized that he must think
and act quickly the first thing was to
escape with a deep breath he braced
himself and sprang for the door-to
plunge straight into the outstretched
arms of a man on guard there

  there was a moments struggle then
dan felt his feet kicked from under
him and fell with a crash that shook
the house in an instant twro men were
sitting on him holding him down

 then pachmann came and looked
down at him his lips twitching with tri-
umph

  young fool he sneered young
fool and then in german to the two
men take him away in yonder
and he pointed toward a door at the
rear of the hall

being another page in the life of a circus man

by courtney ryley cooper
ailthor of  waking up tennessee  coals of fire   etc

from far at the rear of the kid-
show tent there came the click
of the roulette and the drone of
the croupier there echoed the
sliding sound of the three little shells
and the call of the monte man there
came the rattle of the quarters as they
left the hands of eager farmers to jig-
gle their way to oblivion through the
maze of the drop-case-and it all was
music to the ears of shifty bill thomas
of the great consolidated

  it had been many days since shifty
bill had heard the noises of his gam-
bling apparatus and the voices of his
grafters at their chosen work of taking
in the easy money for when one is
desirous of being the mainspring of
such devices and schemes one must be
able to find a sheriff who is willing to
be blind and for weeks this had been
hard shifty bill thomas of the great
consolidated had gone from town to
town he had talked to sheriff after
sheriff he had fingered his bright green
and yellow bills before the eyes of more
than one officer of the peace-carefully
of course-but without results until to-
day and therefore having worked so
hard to gain what he sought he was
taking pleasure in the fulfillment of his
desires for a long time he stood
watching the machinations of the gen-
tleman with the three little shells and
the elusive pea listening to the drone
of the croupier and smiling to himself
the money was pouring in shifty bill
thomas was happy

  it was then that a form came close

to that of the circus owner there
came the sound of a voice low-pitched
and careful shifty turned and looked
into the face of the man who was re-
sponsible for it all-the county sheriff
that individual was anxious appearing
a little smile of expectancy was on his
face a hand was outstretched

  do i get it he asked aint i
kept my word 

  shifty swung his head then withdrew
quickly to a fold in the sidewall the
sheriff followed there was a quick
movement for a pocket the stripping of
bills and the counting of them then
the sheriff departed while shifty bill
thomas his hand rammed deep in his
pocket watched him as he made his
way across the circus lot toward town
a moment more and the circus man
sought the rather small-sized man who
stood before the kidshow and
growled

 take it from me jimmy he
growled i love these coppers
theyre a fine bunch not now get
me this aint any slush stuff but if im
going to be a crook im going to be one
all the way through see everybodys
going to know im a crook but you
aint going to see me handing out no
bunk that im a guardian of the law
and a protector of the innocent and
then sneaking in and skinning the eye-
teeth out of my friends just for some
easy money theres grades in every-
thing see  theres straight crooks
and theres crooked crooks im a
straight crook and im proud of it

but take that old thistlechin that i just

poneyed up to and- whats the

matter with you

  shifty bill was looking down into the
face of jimmy davis of the leaping
tigers he had noticed an expression
of worry on the animal mans face

  rajah went bad again this after-
noon davis said slowly wouldnt
even come out of his cage that cats
going to get somebody one of these days
unless hes whipped pretty soon

shiftys eyes narrowed not get-
ting scared of him are you he asked

  jimmy grinned not yet he an-
swered it aint that shifty ive just
been thinking-suppose something
should happen that i wouldnt be here
some day and somebody else would try
to put those cats through the leaps-
whered they be look here he
came closer and there was an air of
anxiety in his tone if anything should
happen that i wouldnt be on deck for
that leap act hold it out wont you
rajah never would stand for anybody
else but me and im even having trouble
with him now if anybody elsed ever
try to handle him hed rip open their
throat with one plunge i know hes
laying to kill somebody i can see it
hes getting sulky you see its this
way the little animal man said hur-
riedly rajahs right at the point
where he doesnt know whether hes
master or mastered if i can be right
with him all the time and just keep
lighting him even if he half kills me
while im doing it im going to beat
him but if anybody else should step
in-it wouldnt work the game would
all be over thats why i want you to
promise me that if i shouldnt be here
or if i should turn up missing for a
performance or two youll hold out the
act

  hold out the act shiftys head
lowered and it our big card a fine
chance for that what do you want
a lay-off whats going to keep you
from being on hand every time i see
one of you guys he ended half angrily
youre wanting to get off for some-
thing or other im getting tired of it
you be here for every performance or

you aint going to have any job see
well put wilson in there

  im liable not to have the chance to
be here for every performance jimmy
davis went on slowly and if you put
wilson in that cage youre signing his
death warrant thats all

  shifty bill thomas was swinging his
head angrily

  whats going to keep you from
being here

  jimmy davis faltered a bit im

liable to get pinched-i-

  but a booming voice had interrupted
shifty bill thomas was red-faced now

  the same old stall he broke out
every time one of you chaps wants to
break away to go shining up to a skirt
or something like that you have to pull
that old stuff about getting pinched im
getting tired of it hear me you stall
around and stall around about rajah
being bad and all that junk thinking
youre going to get a raise in salary
and then you pull this stuff about get-
ting pinched i never saw an animal
man in my life that didnt have a man-
eater up his sleeve somewhere ready to
pull out when he thought it would do

the most good i never-

  very well jimmy had interrupted
and turned away

  shifty watched him walk across the
lot toward the dressing tent and there
was anger in the circus owners eyes

  if theyd pull some decent stall he
mused half savagely i wouldnt get so
sore but its always just the same
old stuff-the same old gag and im
getting sick of it

  whereupon as a balm for his heated
feelings he once more turned within
the canvas portals of the side show to
seek the recreation and a change of feel-
ings in the ever-pleasing call of the
three-shell man and the whir of the
roulette wheel as it spun the dollars
into the possession of the circus

  and gradually the salve of money
as it rolled into the pockets of his
grafters assuaged the soul of shifty
bill even to the point of forgetting
jimmy davis and his efforts to get away
from work

  the day grew older there came the
jimmy of the tigers



call from the cook tent for the evening
meal but still shifty bill remained in
the little tent where the cappers or
come-on men those beings who are
hired to make business good for gam-
bling games made their bogus winnings
and lured the farmers to try their luck
and inevitably lose where the croupier
still called as his wheel spun slowrer
and slower and came to a final stop
high red and even here yare make
your bets place your money she spins
boys she spins where everything
meant to shifty bill clear profit where
gambling was good and where the eyes
of the sheriff were closed

  the croupier left for supper and
shifty took his place at the wheel the
chandelier men entered the tent one by
one and began examining the gasoline
torches which soon would be needed to
illuminate the tent the croupier re-
turned shifty left his place and
started toward the entrance of the tent
-and stopped at the sight of the pro-
gram man hurrying toward him the
face of that person was nervous

  seen jimmy he asked

  shifty lowered his head jimmy
davis no whats up

  nothing much i guess the pro-
gram man answered still you cant
never tell jimmy blew out of the big
top this afternoon right after the main
show and nobodys seen him since he
aint showed in the cook tent and he
aint been back to the dressing top

  go back to the dressing tent and
wait for him shifty ordered if he
aint there on the call for dressing post
him for a ten-dollar fine he came
around to me this afternoon stalling
like he wanted to get off for something
or other i wouldnt stand for it
now i suppose hes gone on and
taken his time off anyway thats about
all im going to stand from these ginks
that think theyre running the show
hear me  go back and post him

  he turned angrily for the cook tent
then long he sat on the wooden plank
before the table watching the growing
twilight and the crowds as they came
upon the lot the yellowish gleam of
the chandeliers shone through the

muddy tops of the tents gradually the
forms of the big wagons about the lot
began to blur and lose themselves in the
darkness of coming night the rattle
of dishes from without ceased there
sounded the truckling of a wagon and
the shouts of men as they started the
work of taking down and packing the
cook tent for the journey to the next
town shifty bill rose and walked to
the dressing tent the program man
was at the entrance

  i did what you said was his greet-
ing ive posted him he aint showed
yet the director says to put wilson
in for the tiger act that all right
sir

  go on said shifty and stumped
into the tent he sought a pile of can-
vas and plumped upon it then for
ten minutes he scowled at mitchell the
boss clown in the act of making up

  mitchell grinned in the glass all
to the cheerful to-night aint you he
asked

  shifty bill spread his hands with
anger who wouldnt be all ive
got to do in this show is to take care
of a lot of guys that aint got no more
sense than a bunch of school kids play-
ing hooky all i hear from morning to
night is some guy a-cheeping at me
about wanting to get off or something
or other all you fellows think about
is going out and getting boozed and-

and- well you thought youd come

back did you he turned his eyes
from the diiection of the boss clown
and centered them on a figure which
had just entered the tent

  jimmy davis did not answer just
then he was reading the notice of his
fine posted on the center pole and as
he stood there even shifty bill won-
dered a bit at his appearance he was
pale and there seemed a drawn appear-
ance about his mouth dirt was on his
face his clothing was torn in one or
two places his shoes were muddy
his hands gripped a little as he read
the line and looked hard at the amount
of his fine then as he turned there
came a bit of a smile to his face

  i thought that would jiappen he
said slowly as he reached for his tights


the popular magazine

and spangles i knew you didnt be-
lieve me when i talked to you this after-
noon i guess ill have to pay it-if i
can stay out long enough to draw what
little pay is coming to me

  out shifty looked at him a lit-
tle queerly whats-

  shifty-jimmy davis was standing
close to him now talking in low tones-
ive just got one favor to ask of you
ive got to whip rajah-ive felt it
coming weve been fighting until one
or the other of us has got to win out
and from the way hes been acting-
the way he did this afternoon im
thinking that fights going to come to-
night thats the reason i came back
if i whip him and then get away-
and lay low and have luck at it ill pay
that fine  ill mail it to you from some-
where if i dont whip him- he

laughed a bit and spread his hands

   shifty rose and watched the trainer
as he hurried out of his clothes and
into his tights

  came back from where he asked
after a long silence

   jail came the answer with a little
smile i broke out ill make for
the sowbelly of the privilege car as
soon as i get through if  get away
with it if you see--

  davis number four into the
ring

  it was the call of the program man
at the flags the entrance to the big tent
jimmy davis sprang forward adjusted
the last of his spangles felt his re-
volver seized his whip and hurried for-
ward the property men within the
big tent were adjusting the last strip of
steel caging which surrounded his
working space others were holding
down the long chute which led from the
tiger cage he turned for just a sec-
ond and hurried back

   if you see that sheriff he whis-
pered hold him back until i can make
my get-away fi ear me im in bad
shifty started forward it was not a
stall after all then something was
wrong he knew not what-but what-
ever it was it was something in which
his help and his sympathy were needed
as for the return of the performer he

knew well enough in his heart the call
the pull of the sawdust ring the
strength of which was more than
enough to make a man do just what
jimmy davis had done in his heart
too he now realized that what jimmy
davis had said that afternoon concern-
ing rajah and his rebellion was true

  aimlessly one hand went upward
and sought the center pole it gripped
and crumpled the notice of the pro-
gram man and the amount of the fine
slowly the paper was torn to bits and
thrown into the sawdust then shifty
bill thomas of the great consolidated
hurried forward to watch jimmy da-
vis make his bow and hurry through the
door of the big cage

  there was a moment of waiting in
which the little animal trainer walked
half nervously about the trampled in-
closure and snapped his short whip
about his shoulders there came the
sound of a whistle shrill penetrating
the windjammers or musicians as
they are known to the world outside
the circus suddenly shifted their brass
melody there sounded a bit of a
shout in warning from the menagerie
tent adjoining and then in the long
chute there showed the lithe forms of
two of the leaping tigers jimmy davis
was at attention his feet were wide-
spread his whip lay across his hands
shifty looked close then moved for-
ward

  he had seen jimmy look at the two
great cats before him then motion to a
property man standing near by rajah
was missing sulking as usual along the
chute there was a moment of muf-
fled orders a curse or two and the
prodding of a pole through the inclosure
of the run and rajah had joined his
mates pacing slowly to and fro at
the end of the big cage

  jimmy davis smiled a bit then
walked forward

  good boy he said and reaching
out a hand patted the tiger on the head
the animal aid not swerve it did not
move its head nor did it cease from
its pacing again jimmy patted it and
then called his order for the animals
to take their places two of them
jimmy of the tigers



obeyed rajah merely paced on shifty
bill a strange something which even he
could not understand running through
him came closer to the great cage
gradually rajahs actions were begin-
ning to tell the truth of jimmys state-
ments the animal was near to re-
bellion there was something in the
gleam of the eyes the sharp staccato
movement of the steps the swishing of
the long tail and the swinging of the
head which spoke of animal hatred and
catlike stealth the band was blaring
now

  shifty moved close to the cage now
and called softly

  jimmy what are you going to try
to do

  jimmy did not turn his head-he was
too thorough an animal trainer for that
but he did screw his mouth around so
that the words might reach the ear of
his employer without an extra amount
of emphasis he was regarding the
pacing tiger calmly almost noncha-
lantly

  im going to whip him so that hell
kotow to anybody that wants to handle
him was the reply or hell put me in
a wooden kimono one of the six

  he felt again the revolver at his belt
-loaded with its usual blank car-
tridges-then lifted his whip he
moved forward oblivious apparently
of the crowded tiers of seats of all
those who watched of the anxious eyes
of shifty bill and the property men
jimmy davis of the leaping tigers was
about to fight a battle long had he
trained and struggled with the three
great cats in the inclosure he had been
patient he had petted he had scolded
and nursed with the result that peace
had come to two and rebellion to one
and to-night while the band blared
and jimmy davis thought vaguely of
that hour in which he had struggled
with the window of a rickety county
jail he was preparing to finish the job
of training one way or the other
whether he went back to that place
from which he escaped or not made
little difference only one thing was
certain that his end had come as the
tiger man of the great consolidated-

and he was in danger of leaving a job
half done

  there are animal men who take a
pride in their work who feel as much
joy in the subjugation of animal hatred
and animal strength as a general feels
in the subduing of an opposing army
and jimmy davis was one of these
he knew that work wtith the three great
animals before him was over-when
the end of the show came that night he
would either flee far from the muddy
tents of the great consolidated or he
would return to the little jail from
which he had come and jimmy da-
vis did not intend to leave without hav-
ing first taught rajah rajah of the
evil mind the difference between mas-
tery of brain and mastery of strength
he cast one more quick glance toward
the stealthy pacing beast then he
jumped forward and swung his whip
with a revolverlike crack

  terry he called at the most tract-
able of the three beasts terry up
boy

  the tiger rose on its pedestal spread
its paws and settled again jimmy
moved on his voice came again as he
cracked his training whip at the second
animal

  fanger-come  up up

  the command was obeyed rajah
looked swung his head a bit more and
continued his pacing jimmy had taken
his eyes from him once again he was
before terry

  down he ordered and with
clumsy gracefulness the animal left its
pedestal he gave the order again and
the second animal joined the first and
still rajah paced on unmolested
again a command the two tigers
were trotting about their trainer while
rajah seeming to watch the proceed-
ings out of the corner of his gleaming
eyes still sulked as he walked again
a sharp command again-again-terry
and fanger were leaping over each
other at the crack of the whip trotting
in a quick circle and leaping again
there came the voice of jimmy davis
higher than ever

 up over up-over ra-
jah


the popular magazine

  the form of the animal man had
leaped in front of the sulking brute and
cut off his line of pacing the whip
was singing as it cut through the air
singing and stinging as it caught the
tiger behind an ear with its lash and
drove him out of his path once more
came the shout again the whip de-
scended and rajah the sulky took a
step or two toward his leaping com-
rades

  and with him while shifty bill
watched tensely and the crash of the
band seemed to lose just a bit of its
vehemence went jimmy davis the
whip was cutting the air and the ani-
mal still-there came a hissing roar as
rajah showed vicious teeth but jimmy
did not falter he lowered the whip
and leaping straight at the animal he
slapped its jaws shut with a pounding
blow of his fist on its nostrils then
with his open hand he cuffed it first
on one side of the face then the other

  fool with me will you the trainer
demanded up up rajah up

  for just a second rajah was be-
wildered he half turned he swung
again he crouched and made the first
leap there came a sigh of relief from
the lips of shifty bill a bit of applause
from the packed seats but jimmy da-
vis white-lipped and grim-faced did
not seem to hear in an instant he was
across the space which had existed be-
tween himself and the animal coaxing
urging threatening again once more
he gave the command and once more
rajah sullenly joined in the perform-
ance of his comrades for the third
time the shout echoed from the throat
of jimmy davis and then came open
rebellion

  rajah seemed to have paused and
turned in the air then as he came to
the floor of the trodden inclosure his
mannerisms were different his head
sunken below his massive shoulders
was no longer swinging instead there
was coming that hissing sound that
thr-r-r-r-r-r which jimmy davis had
been fearing and hoping against all
night there was a step or two for-
ward a bewildered shaking and swerv-
ing of the body as the animal trainer

dodged this way and that before the
animal-and then the spring

  from the seats from the band stand
from the blanched lips of shifty bill
thomas the scream seemed to come so
suddenly so unanimously that it
sounded like one great thundering
voice a great streak of black and yel-
low had gone suddenly into the air
one great paw had stretched outward
and with its swinging clawing descent
had caught the breast of jimmy davis
and laid it gaping and bleeding as the
little man rolled to the ground beneath
the tiger and then slowly struggled to
his feet again there came the clank-
ing of steel as animal men struggled
with the gate outside a man half stag-
gered toward them his voice shouting
his whip swinging over his head

  not yet-not yet he called over
his shoulder he hasnt gotten me yet
unlock the gate then hold it ready for
a break-but dont do it unless he floors
me

  he made a quick dodge forward and
under the feet of the animal as it sprang
again then with a nimbleness that
defied the streaming blood that poured
from his shoulder and his breast he
was on his feet again and headed
straight for the recalcitrant tiger one
hand was reaching for the revolver
the other attempted to swing high the
whip-but failed it could only grip
the handle loosely muscular exercise
was gone

  but whether the whip swung or not
jimmy did not hesitate straight to the
face of the crouching animal he sprang
and then there spat the red of powder
flame a half recoil by the beast a
loosening of the tense muscles again
there shot forth the flame of the re-
volver-again there was the giving of
just an inch or so in the position of
rajah for the third time there came
the sound of the blank cartridge and
then the revolver went quickly to its
holster while the whip came into use
again

 up rajah hear me up and
over up-up-up get up there

  there were other commands quick
hurried almost vicious as they came
jimmy of the tigers



from the lips of the bleeding half-
staggering man but they went no
farther than the ears of shifty bill
pressed against the steel inclosure the
audience was on its feet shouting clap-
ping its hands the band was blaring
rajah the dangerous rajah the rebel-
lious had in one quick instant given up
his fight and like the mammoth cat he
was was allowing himself to be chased
around the inclosure by the stinging
whip of jimmy davis shifty stared
then leaped far from the inclosure to
the middle platform he spread his
arms and his great voice boomed
quiet he shouted keep quiet
stillness in an instant-stillness ex-
cept for that insisting commanding
voice of jimmy davis as he followed
the animal here and there gradually
driving it to its position

 up rajah up and over up-
up-up

  and the animal obeyed not once not
twice but to every command of its
trainer again and again it made the
leaps with the two other animals which
had been brought forth by jimmy da-
vis from their half-cowering half-
threatening position at the bars rajah
was beaten the band blared forth its
trumpeting chords of the finale there
came the command from the lips of the
trainer and the animals turned for the
long runway to the menagerie tent and
their cages jimmy opened the steel
door of the inclosure and smiled wearily
as he felt the arms of the property men
grasp him

  i got him- he said defiantly

half thankfully to shifty bill guess
maybe youd better get me to the dress-
ing tent and get a doctor im-
one waiting it was the voice of
mitchell the boss clown i beat it
for one when i heard the rumpus
think hes whipped jimmy

  sure of it came the voice of the
little animal man wilson can handle

him now i-

  they were at the flags now and
traversing the brief space between the
main tent and the dressing room a
man had stepped forward shifty bill
looked at him sharply in the half light

  you the doctor he asked then
as the other smiled and his gaze grew
better no-youre the sheriff arent
you

 yes came the answer there
seemed to be a short note about it that
gave the premonition of what was to
follow as soon as we get this fel-
low fixed up i guess ive got to take
him i-

  take him the voice of shifty
bill suddenly went into a roar they
were in the dressing room now and
the property men were placing jimmy
davis on a pile of canvas while the
surgeon ripped the tights from the
long straggling wound well i guess
you wont that mans in no condition

for- whats he done anyway

say- shifty bills head shot for-
ward whatd you nab him on
huh

  embezzlement the man of the star
answered its a-

  ill tell you shifty- jimmy was

calling faintly from the canvas the
circus owner hurried to him im hung
up on a loan-shark deal-see you
know how it was with me last winter
with everything happening that a fel-
low could think of i just got up against
it and i went in the hole three hundred
i had to get out and so i signed up
something with this geek-see  i
didnt know what it was-didnt pay
any attention then i start paying
back i paid back three hundred and
then some more on top of it hes still
on my neck for more i paid up an-
other hundred for interest and stuff
and hes still after me i paid and paid
and paid-and still im not through
then i got tired of it all i told him
and his notes and things to go to thun-
der-that i was not going to pay any
more whats that doc he asked

  dont move your arms so much
came the command of the surgeon as
he swabbed the wound

  shifty bent closer how about this
embezzlement thing he asked

  well thats where he had me came
the answer tf the little animal man
when i signed up there i didnt sign


the cpopulacr magazine

personal notes but acknowledgments
and receipts for so much of the firms
money-just as if i had been a col-
lector for them and had given notice
of so much collections without turning
them in see then when i didnt pay
up-well he had me on a technical
charge of embezzlement i knew it was
coming id gotten a tip on it and i
knew he was tracing me thats why
i got leary this afternoon-leary about
rajah and wilson and everything
and it wasnt an hour before i got
pinched well i couldnt stay there
and think about everything going on up

here and-and- his voice trailed

off his eyes went downward to watch
the hastening hands of the surgeon
shifty bill straightened and there was
a glare in his eyes as he faced the
sheriff

  how much does the thing stand
for he asked shortly

  the sheriff unfolded the complaint
and stared at it

  two hundred he said after a mo-
ment of reading

  shiftys eyes narrowed ill pay it
he said every cent see now get
out of here

  but the sheriff did not leave his posi-
tion

  theres something else he said
something that aint going to be
squared this fellow broke jail this
afternoon after i had arrested him and
hurt my reputation and the reputation
of the county jail i dont care how
much you square with that fellow in
joplin-thats all right what you do
about that but you aint gping to-

  an arm had seized him and he was
being hurried to the far corner of the
dressing tent

  it dont make any difference eh
the voice of shifty bill thomas of
the great consolidated was fierce in its
suppression it doesnt make any dif-
ference-look here its about three
weeks till election aint it aint it
answer me

  what of it the tone belied any
assurance to the question shifty bill

thomas shook a fist beneath the chin of
his adversary

  what ofit he half roared just
this-thats all which would you
rather do be accused of having a fel-
low break out of your two-by-four jail
or have me for a visitor about election
time

  you

  you heard what i said yes me
and ill come back here just as sure as
theres a sun in the sky and ill show
you whether you can pull any come-on
stuff on me ive said if before to-day
and im going to say it now im a
crook and im proud of it because im
a square crook i never took anything
from anybody that wasnt trying to take
something from me but you-whatre
you huh youre the crookedest
sort of a crooked crook youd take
money from a man to keep your eyes
shut and then get your brother into the

game and watch him get skinned-

then youd go away and grin and count
your money now what i want to
know is this-and the great arms
swung again-whether you want to go
back to your dinky little jail and forget
that such a fellow as jimmy davis ever
broke out of that hogpen of yours or
whether you want me here for the week
before election-and so help me if i
do come say your prayers thats all

  jimmy said shifty bill as he
watched the sheriff fade from the tent
i guess its going to cost about three
hundred beans to handle this little deal
eh what

  three hundred a look of sur-
prise was mingled with the wince on the
trainers face as the surgeon plied his
needle whats the other-

  well-and shifty squinted at the
center pole-therell be two hundred
to go to that shark then-and he
swung his shoulders threateningly the
three hundred will go to the best lawyer
in joplin to get that two hundred back
-and run that shylock friend of yours
so far out of the business hell need a
lusitania to get back home on that
stitching hurt much
 memling must hav an alibi

by rupert hughes

author of   the very grand piano robbery  memlings ten-story

treasure chest etc

    in his last four stories rupert hughes told us of the looting of a storage
warehouse by dirk memling and nellie among the interesting things found
in the warehouse were certain private documents concerning mrs willoughby
worthington in this story dirk and nellie use these documents to force
the society woman to harbor them in her handsome home and thus put the
police off their track you couldnt call it blackmail and rupert hughes
wittily coins the word whitemail the situation is a whimsical one and
you will enjoy the comedy

of all the house parties that ever
house-partied doik nellie
summed up the situation to
memling this is soitainly the
woist mrs hostess had to be black-
mailed out of the invitation and mrs
guestess and friend husband only ac-
cepted in prefrunce to goin to the peni-
tentiary fd always hoid that high so-
ciety folks are bored to death all the
time but i didnt know how doleful
they could be why i couldnt be
boreder if i was in a solitary cell its
abslutely ghassly thats all just
ghassly

  memling sighed dismally the cir-
cumstances are not particularly condu-
cive to a jocund entente

  nellie threw him a startled look i
got the woid soicumstances but after
that i fell off but i think the soicum-
stances are such that we all got a right
to be full of glee and moith heres
you the greatest sculptor in the woild
making the portrait bust of a grande
dame-i suppose swells dont call it
bust but boist-anyway you ought to
be happy dabbling in clay again but you
act like you was kneading red-hot mush
and it boint your fingers

this series began in the first may popular

   and heres mrs woithington that
 ought to be proud as a toik at having
 her double chin poipetrated to immortal
 fame by a great sculptor but shes act-
 ing like she was a shoplifter being held
 and mugged for the rogues gallery

    and heres me thats prayed all my
 life to get a look-in at high society and
 now that i find myself really inside a
 swell home without committin boig-
 lary im wondering if i can kep from
 screaming and chewing up the foiniture
 one day more

   there isnt enough cheerfulness in
 all three of us to make one stingy smile
 and were so dismal that a groan of dis-
 tress sounds like an outboist of careless
 rapcher this morning when mrs
 woithington woke up long enough to
 say could you tell me the time it
 sounded like gabriels trumpet in a
 graveyard

    its the foist time i ever realized
 how long etoinity would be i spent a
 coupla etoinities watching you woik this
 morning and i cant stand another this
 afternoon i just cant all we do is
 sit around and think of our past
 crimes

   and all three of them had crimes to

back numbers can be obtained from any news dealer


the popular magazine

think of dirk memling and nellie had
completed the most ambitious and tri-
umphant crime of their careers-the
raid on the continental storage ware-
house-and they were for the first
time closely shadowed by the police

  they had found that a storage ware-
house is a vast receptacle for many
things besides jewelry cash securities
silver clothes automobiles paintings
pianos-and what not in the conti-
nental there were flocks of trunks full
of letters and some of the safe-deposit
boxes were choked with legal papers

  memling and nellie had brought
away many of these not from a vulgar
curiosity but as a possible shield
against future necessities

  when memling divided up the loot
with the twelve professional criminals
who had aided him to carry it off he
made an honorable partition of all the
proceeds-that is a lion would have
called it a fair partition he took a third
of the total for himself leaving the bal-
ance to be split into twelve parts

  in this division he had not included
the captured documents though he con-
sidered some of them more valuable
than money in the first place they
could not have been divided without de-
stroying them and in the second since
he and nellie had elected to remain in
new york while the rest scattered to
all the points of the compass he felt
that he had a right to the use of these
documents for his own defense

 among the collection memling
placed chief reliance on what he had
found in police lieutenant melicks
safe-deposit box-a stack of bills
amounting to thirty thousand dollars
and a number of incriminating memo-
randa showing that the officer had col-
lected the sum through illicit dealings
with gamblers

  one of the accomplices had also un-
earthed in a trunk full of costumes and
stage jewelry a bundle of love letters
written by the district attorney they
were not written to mrs district at-
torney memling had an idea that these
might come in handy in case the police
lieutenant or the district attorney grew
unpleasantly active	

  nellie for her part had slipped into
her bosom a document to which mem-
ling had attached no importance it
was simpb a certified copy of the de-
cree in the divorce case of a prominent
society woman mrs percy schermer-
man who had named as corespondent
a still more prominent woman mrs
willoughby worthington the evi-
dence had been sealed and the yellower
papers had toiled in vain to find out just
who the prominent corespondent was

  instinct told nellie that certain news-
papers would pay a fortune for that
document but she did not intend to
stoop to its sale still she felt that it
might be of use

  it was not many days after the ware-
house robbery before memling realized
that they were being shadowed they
dared not attempt flight what they
needed was an alibi if somebody
swore that they were somewhere else
at the time of the robbery this would
indicate that they could not have been
at the robbery-provided the somebody
else was a credible witness and there
were material proofs to substantiate the
affidavit

  memling knew numbers of people
who would have sworn him anywhere
they would have cheerfully tossed off
an affidavit that they had lunched with
him and peary at the north pole that
afternoon or passed the evening play-
ing pinochle with him on the planet
mars but to find an alibi affirmer who
was at the same time willing to commit
perjury and reputable enough to con-
vince the cynical police was something
of a task

  it was nellie that was inspired re-
membering the copy of the schermer-
man decree with its definite mention of
the great name of mrs willoughby
worthington she realized that mrs w
w would move heaven and earth to
keep herself out of the limelight all
that would be needed would be the
dramatizing of an alibi to support the
perjury

  but the scheme for this also came to
nellie in a shower memling was
dazed but obedient they gave their
shadow the slip by various doublings
memling must have an alibi



turnings taxicab dashes and the use of
subway stations and buildings with
various exits then they took train to
the long island home of mrs worth-
ington where according to the news-
papers she was spending a few quiet
weeks

  nellie and memling came down on
her fold like assyrian wolves their
visit was as unwelcome as it was unex-
pected

  mrs worthington was disdainful at
first but humble enough when she un-
derstood with what weapon memling
and nellie were armed it was a long
time since her narrow escape from pub-
licity in the schermerman divorce had
scared her back into a reconciliation
with her husband the reappearance
of the old ghost filled her with terror
her first thought was that nellie would
demand hush money and she inly re-
solved to pay anything even to the half
of her husbands fortune

  when nellie announced that the price
of silence was merely a little hospitality
and a certain amount of posing for a
portrait bust together with a small
amount of perjury mrs worthington
almost fainted with relief

  as she came to herself she began to
fret the perjury troubled her less
than the invitation for while mrs
worthington scattered white lies with
a lavish hand she was as chary of her
hospitality as monarchs are of theirs
she felt indeed that one of her invita-
tions to a dinner dance was equivalent
to a presentation at court while an in-
vitation to spend a week-end at her
long island chateau was equal to the
conferring of a title of nobility

  to have two strangers walk into her
house and settle there like squatters
compelling her to entertain them or
take the consequences was appalling
to realize that her guests were fugi-
tives from the law that they were apt
to be visited by the police and that she
must connive with them-well it was
paying a high price for an ancient in-
discretion

  she had long ago quarreled with
percy schermerman and she had never

oia

cared deeply for him she had flirted
writh him mainly because she enjoyed
the fuming jealousy of his wife then
the wife had had the insane impulse to
sue for divorce and to name her as a
corespondent it had cost a lot of
money and more stratagem to keep the
evidence out of the papers

  such an ordeal for a wild love would
have been bitter enough such an ex-
perience for flirtations sake was nau-
seating the sudden appearance of the
two strangers from the underworld
with their uncanny power over her
threw her into a rage against mankind
in general and percy schermerman in
particular yet there was nothing for
her to do but submit she surrendered
and begged memling and nellie to be
her guests

ii

  nellie was almost more frightened
when she took up her abode under the
worthington roof than if she had been
entering a court of justice for trial she
had been born and reared in poverty
and she had grown up into a studio
career as a model for artists to whom
formalities were as hateful as formulas
she had traveled a bit and lived for a
while in good hotels but never had she
visited an aristocratic home

  she had read novels and stories and
seen plays galore concerning high life
but they were mainly written by au-
thors wtho knew nothing of their sub-
ject or who evaded the details ac-
cording to these writers life in a man-
sion was one long dress parade between
a double line of liveried servants
through a world in which everybody
spoke with painful correctness and elab-
orate pomposity

  if airs worthington had lived the
life of storybooks nellie might have
walked through her drawing-room
without attracting attention it was the
easy informality and comfort of the
home that upset nellie then just as
she adapted herself to this atmosphere
some little snag of convention tripped
her up

  she asked mrs worthington what
explanation she gave the household of


the popular magazine

the unforeseen guests mrs worth-
ington set her down hard

  why should i explain my guests to
my servants  so long as they get their
outrageous wages it is enough

  it was magnificent but untrue the
servants betrayed the most feverish in-
terest in memling and nellie nellies
dialect put her out of the pale of mrs
worthingtons normal list at once
memling they could understand but
nellie-mrs worthington entertained
many strange people eccentric singers
actresses lions and lionesses of every
sort and foreigners of various degree

but nellie-

  the keyholes were never so closely
attended and ears were never so alert
but they found out nothing for mem-
ling and nellie were secretive by pro-
fession when any exchange of confi-
dence was necessary mrs worthington
led her guests out to the beach where
the resounding surf drowned their
words

  the french maid who waited upon
nellie and the englishman assigned
to memling pumped and questioned
with the most persistent adroitness but
learned nothing

  all that mrs worthington told them
was that mr and mrs memling were
to stay several days and that they had
spent the previous saturday night there
the servants had not known of this and
eyebrows went up but mrs w orthing-
ton brought them down again by the
frown on her own

  remember she commanded if in-
qtiiries are made by any one you are to
say and to swear that mr and mrs
memling were here last saturday and
spent the night here

  since a large part of a servants busi-
ness is telling the employers lies this
demand caused no mutiny though it
inflamed vain curiosity still further

  meanwhile memling was at work
he had telephoned to a dealer in art
materials to send at once a modeling
stand a sculptors tools and a quantity
of cla while these were coming he
was building up an armature to support
the clay with pieces of lead pipe and
wire obtained in the village

  there followed laborious niussy
hours of breaking the soppy clay up
into small pellets and kneading them
bit by bit into the general mass of the
bust then he was ready and he sum-
moned mrs worthington to pose he
was anxious to get the work well under
way before the first detective like the
first snowflake brought on the winter
of discontent

  mrs worthington was reluctant to
pose and memling found her an unin-
spiring subject she was oppressed by
the knowledge that he knew the great
dark secret of her life he was op-
pressed by the fact that she knew a
black page in his life it was small
wonder that the atmosphere was as
gloomy as nellie pictured it

  but a little later nellie was longing
for the old boredom again in place of
the new excitement for mrs worth-
ington began to take an interest in
memling at first it was the deft in-
genuities of his gifted hands that caught
her then she made him talk and his
ideas fascinated her he was a gentle-
man born and bred and they met as
peers

  after the schermerman escape she
had vowed to herself and her forgiving
husband that she would never flirt
again but as the inveterate gambler
returns to the wheel after every calam-
ity so the soul addicted to flirtation re-
verts to type as soon as the chance re-
curs

  as soon as mrs worthington real-
ized that memling was handsome bril-
liant curiously attractive she decided
that he was far too good for the crea-
ture he called his wife with exquisite
gradations from insolence to tolerance
to politeness to interest to cordiality
she began  a flirtation that rendered
memling uncomfortable and infuriated
nellie

  we threw an awful scare into that
dame at foist said nellie but shes
beginning to poik up sumpum dread-
ful shes beginning to floit with you

  oh you mustnt misunderstand
her memling protested thats just
her way of being courteous

  coiteous  ill coiteous her that
memling must have an alibi



female would floit with st peter at
the poily gates but shed better toin
down the light in those goo-goo lamps
of hers or ill scratch em out and
throw em in her face

  memling protested but nellie was not
to be appeased she persisted in being
present at the sittings her eyes fol-
lowed every move of artist and model

  her presence reduced mrs worth-
ington to silence and as memling hard-
ly dared look at his subject he made
little progress the very atmosphere
of the room became so stupid and mo-
rose and silent that the boredom drove
nellie for a long walk on the beach
which was perhaps what mrs worth-
ington planned for when nellie re-
turned she heard mrs worthington
chattering like a magpie and memling
laughing with more than polite interest
mrs worthington was saying
after all there isnt any figure more
picturesque than claude duval or dick
turpin do you think so if one is a
gentleman it doesnt matter so much
about his profession does it  i always
believe that manners are far more im-
portant than morals dont yci in
fact they are the highest kind of morals
-dont you think so or do you
nellie retreated from the door in a
sick disgust she tiptoed back to the
veranda stretched herself out  a
chaise longue of rattan and wished to
die

  wild projects thrilled her to break up
the sitting and snatch memlings sus-
ceptible soul from the lair of the siren

  as she fretted there was a soft step
on the walk and mr willoughby
worthington appeared he was all in
white and about to go aboard his yacht
his scholarly eye had noted nellies
beauty as she lounged relaxed and
pouting she was particularly attractive
he lifted his yachting cap and invited
her to join him while the others
worked

  nellie hated to be away from dirk
under any circumstances to leave him
with that outrageous fisherwoman was
dangerous she shook her head and in-
formed mr worthington that she was
just as much obliged commodore-

he was the commodore of his yacht club
-but no thank you

  the commodore looked disappointed
and insisted while he was urging her
nellie was remembering that absence
is said to make the heart grow fonder
she wondered if it would not be the
best tactics to leave memling alone with
his old frump of a grande damn-
nellie thought of her now with an n
she knew that memling had a gift for
jealousy and she sometimes felt that
she neglected it too much if he really
loved her he would think more about
her if she were out yachting with an-
other man than if she were helplessly
sulking in a chair while he sculped an-
other woman if he really loved her he
would be truer to her in her trusting
absence than under her suspicious es-
pionage

  the third time the commodore re-
peated his invitation she nodded yes
and went to the door of the room set
apart as a studio to say

  pardong doik but the commodore
is oiging me to take a little stroll in his
yacht and i thought i would-wouldnt
you or would you 

  memling turned an anxious face her
way and frowned privately at her
i-im afraid you-well of course

-but-do you think-

  all right good-by said nellie and
she hastened with the commodore to
where a small motor boat bobbed and
grided the little pier he called it the
porpoise and it went out to the yacht in
a series of looping leaps that justified
its name and gave nellie cause for in-
tense internal anxiety

iii

  once aboard the lugger nellie was
still miserabler

  its funny she burbled from the
veranda the water looked so smooth
and basky but its full of holes and
ruts isnt it

  to the greeks the stomach was the
organ of the affections and perhaps it
was her troubled affections that kept
nellie so ill at ease during the short
spin perhaps it was jealousy that gave


the popular magazine

her complexion so green a pallor she
tried to talk fast enough to forget her
distress but she was afraid to laugh
much

  the only comfort she had was in see-
ing the distant figure of memling
watching the boat from the worthing-
ton lawn she could tell by his very
outline that he was wretchedly anxious
and she rejoiced to think that mrs
worthington was gaining small advan-
tage from having him alone

  once she was assured of memlings
devotion nellie found no delight in his
torment she loved him too well she
begged the commodore to drop her at
the next stop and the commodore who
had been trying the same tactics with
his own spouse was glad enough to re-
turn

  nellie put it dowrn to mrs worthing-
tons credit that she too had under-
stood and undergone jealousy during
the promenade of the yacht she could
be heard berating the commodore for
gadding about with that creature at
the same time memling was rendering
nellie deliciously happy by storming at
her for eloping with that old roue

  its no woise for me to go sailing
with an old roue she answered than
for you to stay here floiting with an old
rouette

  but im not floiting-flirting with
her memling raged

  oh no nellie flared back with
an excellent concealment of her real
joy i didnt hear her calling you
claude duval and dick toipentine
and saying manners are better than
morals and dont you or do you did
i oh no

 but nellie-

  all i gotta say is if she dont watch
out ill take that bust youre makin
and bust it over her head

  memling cast up his hands in despair
well i give up it was your idea and
ive tried to carry it out the man who
tried to get anywhere with two women
in double harness is bound to get a
smash-up ill go back to town and let
the police take me to the nice quiet peni-
tentiary where there are no women at
all

  the mention of the penitentiary
brought nellie back to earth the hot
flashes of jealousy gave way to a cold
sweat of terror she had almost for-
gotten that she was in more danger of
losing memling to the law than to this
lady and that the penitentiary would
divorce them more effectually than any
flirtation

  were soitainly a pair of tts said
nellie youd think we was a coupla
millionaires tryin to kill time instead
of a coupla boiglars tryin to keep from
doin it weve got our alibi all built
up but when are we going to get a
chance to use it  ive been expecting
to see a platoon of coppers pop out of
every sand dune but were desoited
completely its getting on my noives
they dont know where we are
said memling we left no clew wed
better enjoy our peace while it lasts
but im afraid our alibi will get
stale if they come after us now while
were all primed up maybe we can per-
suade em that we couldnt have been
in  the burglary and maybe thel
drop vis but if we wait theyll catch us
when were not ready

  thats true memling admitted
wed better get it over with ill go
back to the studio and let the shadow
pick me up and follow me here

  oh no you wont said nellie
the coppers would pick you up and
slam you in jail then the newspapers
would headline us and mrs woithing-
ton would toin against us we gotta
do the job right here--and the sooner
the quicker

  but how am i to get the police here
i cant call them up and invite them
down for the week-end

  you telephone the janitor to for-
ward your mail here and hell tell the
police as fast as he can get to em
do you think he would give us
away 

 give us away that janitor
wouldnt give away one yank at the
dumb-waiter rope but hell sell his
own wife for thoity cents you can bet
the shadow is in touch with him and if
he can touch the shadow he will all
right alt right
memling must have an allbl



  memling obeyed nellies impulse
the janitor was so happy to hear his
voice and so careful to get the address
right that memling was convinced of
the mans eagerness to sell the knowl-
edge to the police

  theyll be here on the milk train in
the morning said nellie and theyll
be disguised as everything on oith ex-
cept coppers wed better spend this
evening rehoising our alibi

  there was a sudden zero in their
hearts as they realized that they were
approaching thegreat duel of wits with
the detectives success meant so
much failure meant the end of every-
thing except life-and what was life
without liberty and the pursuit of hap-
piness 

iv

 the commodore was fortunately
called to a meeting of the house com-
mittee of his yacht club and the even-
ing was devoted to perfecting the alibi

  a complete series of events was con-
structed and memorized rehearsed al-
tered and rerehearsed memling tried
to foresfall every possible flaw in the
story he played the part of an imag-
inary detective and put mrs worthing-
ton nellie and himself through gruel-
ing cross-examinations

  the consequence was that as fast as
he elaborated a satisfactory story he
destroyed its plausibility by some ques-
tion revealing some unforeseen contra-
diction as fast as a story was mem-
orized it was ordered off the books
chaos soon reigned supreme

  mrs worthington began to complain
of brain fag and nellie to grow hys-
terical memling himself felt the in-
vasion of panic

  its small wonder that crime is diffi-
cult he mused aloud for the crimi-
nal has to take things as they come a
playwright can imagine his own people
and his own plot and then after he has
worked over it for years and after a
company has rehearsed it for weeks--
when it is played it may be found so
full of contradictions that the lowest
brow in the gallery wont accept it and

yet some people blame criminals for
lack of imagination and intelligence
mrs worthington was wrorn to peev-
ishness and she observed contemptu-
ously 

  they show their lack of intelligence
in attempting the crime in the first
place and as for imagination if they
had any they would realize that they
are bound to be caught

  not necessarily said memling
for the people who are set to catch
them are sometimes even less intelli-
gent and even less imaginative and
the coarsest work sometimes goes un-
detected the plainest clews overlooked
do you know that about two-thirds of
the crimes are never traced and three-
fourths of the stolen goods never re-
covered 

  still i insist mrs worthington
snapped that anybody who attempts a
crime is a fool

  memling met her discourtesy with a
helpless shrug but nellie was furi-
ous

  not forgetting that theres crimes
and crimes she said as i obsoived
once before theres other command-
ments besides the one against stealing
its a crime to dally with the seventh
and dames that steal other dames hus-
bands lack imagination and intelligence
too sometimes and sometimes they get
caught too sometimes the clews toin
up in the most unexpected places now
theres the unknown thoid party in the

schoimerman case-

  mrs worthington waited i sur-
render she sighed go on with the
rehearsal

  when the commodore - came back
from the meeting of what the club
called the souse committee the three
conspirators had just put the finishing
touches to the final story that seemed
best fitted to stand the strain of exami-
nation

  seeing their jaded look the commo-
dore queried a trifle foggily

  the next morning opened with a
warning of battle as nellie had feared
the maid berthe who brought the cof-
fee and rolls to the memling bedroom
announced that they had already had a
visitor

  what sort of a visitor boit said
nellie a gentleman

  non madame not a zhontlymon
zhoost a man

  how was he dressed-in uniform 
non madame he is not a soldat-
zhoost a man-beeg man wit two
shoulders enormous he carried a hat
to his head a suit of beesnees a-i do
not know what

  his feet-how were his feet
very grand madame and very
flat

  nellie turned to memling i knew
it they can disguise anything except
their feet she turned to berthe
and what did he have to say for him-
self boit

  nossing for himself madame me
i do not go to the door but i hear heem
ask the second man much question-
when are you come here how long you
stay and i do not know what

what did the second baseman say
he say you are come feerst for sat-
urday a week ago and then you are
come back for veesit and make the bust
of madame

  nellie sighed with relief doik
youll have to slip that second baseman
a little extra pin money he remem-
bered what he was taught say boit
did the flattie go away  did the man
go away

  mais oui madame

  god bless our home said nellie
but he will come back when you
are up

  and then berthe bustled away leav-
ing the couple to renewed alarm the
detective had not been convinced by the
servants lie

  when they were bathed and dressed
and downstairs it was nearly noon and
mrs worthington had not appeared
nellie insisted on having her routed out
for a dress rehearsal the hostess pro-

ceeded to have an acute attack of stage
fright she threatened to turn her
guests over to the police on her own
testimony she threatened to vanish
and leave them to their own resources
but their counterthreat of exposing
her complicity in the schermerman
scandal always brought her back to
terms mr worthington having long
ago decided to give and take forgiveness
for his wifes and his own wanderings
from the straight and narrow path of
discretion had also gallantly deter-
mined to protect her from the world
he added his powerful influence to the
cause

  everybody waited impatiently for the
officer to return but he did not appear
at length memling made out a burly
figure on a bench on the lawn near the
beach he made out other figures
lounging about the different exits from
the place it was evident that during
the night a cordon had been drawn
around the worthington estate they
were under siege

  believing that the best defense is at-
tack memling determined to make a
sally after an examination through
the commodores marine glasses he de-
cided that the man on the front beach
was lieutenant melick himself in plain
clothes he decided to beard the lion
before the lion sprang at him nellie
protested frantically but memling an-
swered that if they were to be taken it
would happen inside the house or out

  he lighted a cigar and setting his
cap jauntily on his head sauntered out
toward the burly figure which rose
burlily to meet him with a policemans
hoarse inquiry

  aint your name memling

  i have that melancholy honor
  well ive come for you

  have you indeed  thats flattery 
do you want a portrait bust of your-
self your wtife-

  ive got orders to arrest you

nental storage warehouse

they caught the robbers 

  weve caught one

  congratulations and is he in
jail

memling made a polite effort to con-
trol his laughter you policemen are
wonderful how did you find me out 
oh we dont tell all we know
and perhaps you dont know all you
tell when was the warehouse robbed 
last satday week

why let me see--i was--i was--

  had you indeed i hope i behaved

several days and the bust is coming
along swimmingly

  oh swim out

  you dont believe me

  nagh

  would you believe mr or mrs
worthington and the servants

  that depends can i talk to em
i dont know mrs worthington is
rather careful whom she meets

  i guess not seein shes harborin
youse two

  come see the bust anyway

  the officer waddled alongside and
memling chose the opportunity to upset
the mans odious complacency but he
did not confess that he recognized him
as melick

  do you know your face is very fa-
miliar to me said memling graciously
and received an ungracious answer
us cops mugs gets familiar to
crooks

  undoubtedly but ive seen your

picture in the paper-only the other
day wasnt it

  the officer flushed his picture had
been published in connection with the
gambling upheaval he was spoken of
and illustrated as the pickpockets
friend the grafter extraordinary and
the next suspect to be called before the
grand jury for indictment

  memling had gained the first point
he had reminded the strong arm of the
law that it was liable to the law he
knew perfectly well that the published
portrait was melicks but he said

  i cant remember your name officer
but i never forget a face i cant re-
member whether or not you were
praised or blamed but your face i cant
forget

  melick passed his handkerchief
around his collar it was a warmish
day and he had a bull neck

  melick is my name he growled
mellen  said memling thats
right i remember now inspector mel-
len isnt it

  not yet melick grunted

  but it surely will be soon mem-
ling beamed i dont know much
about police affairs but with so many
policemen going to sing sing promo-
tions must be very rapid and you look
to me like an ambitious man you
leave no stomach unturned-i mean no
stone unturned fancy now youre
being so thorbugh as to visit the home
of so prominent a man as commodore
worthington and accuse a starving
sculptor of having carried off a whole
storage warehouse im flattered you
know even samson only carried off the
gates of gaza while i pocketed an en-
tire building

  melick was as angry as a bull nagged
by a gnat he shook his horns wrath-
fully memling led him to the door
and the old butler admitted them

  will you tell mr and mrs worth-
ington said memling that captain
mellen is calling

  melick was too sullen to correct him
but he beckoned the old man out on
the veranda where he questioned him
as to the dates of memlings visit the
old butler corroborated memlings


the wular magazine

statement with the perfect technique of
a lifetime of vicarious falsehood

  melicks assurance was further
shaken at this he was ushered into
the sumptuous living room and placed
in a delicate chair which promised to
crumble underneath his weight at the
least motion this added to his dis-
comfort then mr and mrs worth-
ington came in they were as nervous
as if they were themselves the crimi-
nals but the lieutenant was more un-
easv he made the fatal mistake of
apologizing first he who apologized to
mrs worthington was lost she im-
mediately became haughty and insolent
as only she could be

  melick regretted to trouble them but
there had been a big job pulled off and
he was after the crook nellie slipped
into the room and dropped into a chair
to be greeted by a searching gaze from
melick which she met with a look of
angelic innocence

 the commodore blustered and
stormed at the invasion of his sacred
home he demanded the evidence but
melick declined it he mentioned the
date of the robbery and memling in-
terposed 

  the droll thing about it is that i
happened to be here on that date
thats true the commodore
growled he came down to see about
making a bust of my wife

  so he pretended to me said melick
  pretended  the commodore roared

do you mean to insinuate-

  i aint insinuatin nothin melick
muttered lemme see that bust
they led him to the room where
memling had worked the sculptor
lifted the wet cloths from the clay and
mrs worthington stood by it rough
as the work was the likeness was evi-
dent though melick could not enjoy the
artistic power of it mrs worthing-
ton however looked at it with a new
appreciation of its possibilities it was
like looking into a mirror and she
loved her mirror

  memling tore a handful of wet clay
from the base of the bust and began
to work it over in his hands while mel-

ick attempted the role of prosecuting
attorney

  when did he begin the thing
saturday said mrs worthington
last saturday she nodded
but the robry was satdy week

  i came down to arrange- mem-
ling began but melick cut him off
let her talk

  he came down to arrange the sit-
tings a week before-didnt you  said
m rs worthington memling nodded

  how did he come down  by train
boat trolley

  by train i think-or did you motor
down 

 by- memling began

  let her do the talking melick
growled what train did he come
on 

  i never remember such things said
mrs worthington it was early in
the afternoon i think

  i came by the two-thirty-eight
said memling remembering the train he
arrived on the friday before

  melick pylled out a train schedule
and pushed a forefinger like an eclair
along it that train dont run sat-
days he grinned triumphantly

  quite true said memling that
was the train i came back on i forget
the time of the other

  oh you do do you

  yes im not a time-table you know

-im only a-

  well how did you come to the
house

  i picked up a cab at the station
  would you remember the man 
  yes no i-let me see

  mrs worthington intervened i
sent my car down for you-dont you
remember 

  of course you did

  wheres the cheffure

  the commodore who knew the trains
by heart summoned the butler

  go ask bawson if i didnt send him
to the station a week ago last saturday
to meet mr memling on the two-
twenty-six

  the two-twenty-six yes sir
melick interposed bring him here
to me the chauffeur was fetched
memling must have an albi



and testified that he had indeed gone to
meet the two-twenty-six he remem-
bered it so well because the limousine
had split a shoe and he had to take the
runabout

  melick let him go he was baffled
by the confirmation at every hand yet
the exactness of the memories rendered
him suspicions he turned to mrs
worthington

  who told you this man memling
was a good sculpture  he demanded

 oh everybody knows mr mem-
lings work

  i dont who told you about him
specially 

  airs harry creighton i think ad-
vised me to-

  where can i see mrs creighton-
in paris i think she sailed satur-
day

  melick pondered o course i aint
doubting you but how do i know mem-
ling done that bust  how do i know
hes a artist 

  memling held in front of him the
lump of clay he had been thumbing it
was now a little portrait of the lieuten-
ant-a hasty improvisation yet so
strangely like that the others laughed
and melick flushed he liked memling
none the better for either the carica
ture or the proof of his ability

  he thrashed about with other ques-
tions in awkward determination to find
a contradiction when airs worth-
ington slipped memling corrected her
till he insisted that memling and nel-
lie be sent from the room

  memling and nellie withdrew in a
manner of amused contempt but once
away from the baleful presence of mel-
ick they gazed at each other in an ac-
cess of terror they waited outside
like collaborating playwrrights on a first
night wondering what the fateful ver-
dict was to be and helpless to correct
or revise

  they could not know what questions
were being asked what answers given
or what opinions formed they could
not interpose or prompt they could
only wait

  but melick was in better hands than
theirs he could not treat the worth-

ingtons as crooks he could not im-
agine a reason for their harboring crim-
inals the divorce scandal never oc-
curred to him in his wildest gropings
for a theory he was soon on the de-
fensive trying to justify his own pres-
ence at a gentlemans home accusing a
gentle artist of a daring burglary once
he was on the retreat mrs worthing-
ton shriveled him with sarcasm and the
commodore crumpled him with indig-
nation

  his next appearance before memling
was when he backed out apologetic
from the presence of the worthingtons
who had snubbed presumptuous people
all their lives till they were champions

  melick mumbled his regrets to mem-
ling too but there was an ugly look in
his eye his evidence against memling
was feeble and disconnected and not
ready for the eye of a jury and yet
there were links in it that confirmed his
instinct

  there was a subdued rejoicing over
his exit but memling saw that the
cordon was not withdrawn strange
men loitered about the gates they were
dressed like civilians but their carriage
was that of policemen on fixed post

  were not out of the woods yet
memling sighed

  and were going to stay in em
nellie announced if we step outside
well be nabbed and hurried off to new
york for the thoid degree

  at mrs worthingtons request
memling resumed work on the bust but
his mind was working over other prob-
lems his fingers however were so
practiced in their art that while one
part of his brain was laboring over the
problem of escape the other was fash-
ioning mrs worthingtons image into
a thing of art and beauty with which
she fell more and more in love

  all that day the cordon remained
and the next morning the same figures
were visible like hungry wolves on the
prowl about a sheepfold

vi

  doik we gotta do sumpum to shake
off that melick mut said nellie we
cant stay here forever i think id


the popular magazine

rather be in the pen than spend a life
sentence here watching mrs worthing-
ton pouring the love light from her
eyes on you and dodging the old com-
modores inipoitinent advances to me

  if i only had those documents of
melicks here i could scare him to
death i wasnt as wise as i thought i
was when i put them in the continental
warehouse for now i cant get them
without going to town and once i
leave this castle theyll never let me
come back

  theres the commodores yacht
said nellie

  an inspiration said memling
but i cant get out to it without run-
ning the gantlet

  let me think said nellie and he
let her think

  she came up from the depths of
meditation with a new scheme

  it sounds loony she said but
its woith trying so they tried it

  the worthingtons agreed to it the
commodore welcomed any effort that
might relieve him of the burden of his
guests his skipper coming ashore for
instructions was ordered to take out
with him a suit case of memlings
clothes and bring one of the sailors
back

  when he returned the jacky was in-
structed to slip off his jacket and flar-
ing breeches and go to bed memling
dressed himself as a sailor and went
out with the skipper to the launch the
commodore mrs worthington and
nellie made themselves conspicuous on
the veranda

  memling reached the pier without be-
ing held up and the motor boat has-
tened him to the yacht the anchor
came up with a rush and the vessel
turned her nose to new york mem-
ling retired to a stateroom and emerged
in his own clothes the yacht dropped
him in a dinghy at an unfrequented slip
and he made his way to his club found
in his letter box the self-addressed en-
velope containing the safe-deposit
keys and took a taxicab to the ware-
house

  there he asked for his safe-deposit
box and retired to one of the little

cells he copied the memoranda which
proved melicks association with gam-
blers and his blackmailing methods to-
ward the very outlaws he was hired to
suppress then he took from the bun-
dle of melicks money a thousand-dol-
lar bill and with deep reluctance de-
cided to return it to him

  then he wrote with a laborious left
hand the following

loot mellic

  dere sir i take my pen in han to inform
you you better drop the storag warehous
mater and turn yure atenshun to fixing up
yure oan case i got away with yure do
and yure papers if you doan believe it here
is a coppv of part of yure papers i will male
the origernal to the districk aturny if you
munky any more around this case then you
wil go to the pen like what you want me to
do so to show you i got you were the hare is
short i send you one of yure thousand dolar
bils if you are a good boy i wil send you
another sum day if you dont take a frens
advise you wil get no more mony and a trip
up the river to you now were yours
truely	yure fren x

  memling addressed the envelope in
the same scrawl marked it pursonel
inclosed the thousand dollars with a
sigh and pocketed it he addressed
another envelope to himself at the club
to take the keys back to a safe place
where they could not be found if he
were searched

  then he copied quickly three of the
district attorneys love letters and
placing the copies inside the lining of
his waistcoat restored the box to the
vault slipped the keys into the en-
velope summoned a taxicab and or-
dered the driver to take him to a saloon
near a pier downtown

  at an obscure corner on the lower
east side he stopped the cab a mo-
ment while he dropped the letters into
a post box

  when the cab had left him at the
saloon he bought a few atrocious
cigars loitered about as if waiting for
some one and vanished at the side door
at the slip he found the dinghy wait-
ing and he was promptly put aboard
the yacht

  on the way back to the worthing
tons he felt in a mood to enjoy the sun-
set triumphing in splendor along the
memling must have an alb



sky and the bay the statue of lib-
erty held up her torch as if to show him
the way to freedom

  he put on the sailors clothes again
his own suit case repacked was
dumped into a hamper of vegetables
with which he descended into the mo-
tor boat once at the pier he assumed
his most sailorish gait and toted his
hamper round to the kitchen door

  as soon as it was possible to restore
the costume to the imprisoned jacky
that sailor issued from the kitchen and
went back to the yacht none of the
idle sentinels suspected that the uniform
had housed two men that day

  nellie had suffered agonies of terror
for memling she overwhelmed him
with devotion when he was safe in her
arms again and he told her of his ad-
ventures as if they were the chronicles
of sindbad

  if youre sindbad she said old
melick is in-bad watch him back
out

  the next morning the cordon was
still decorating the environs but at
noon it was mysteriously removed

vii

  memling and nellie began to enjoy
the luxury of the worthington home

  the bust progressed but slowly
memling was willing to take his time
about it now sometimes like anoher
penelope he undid at night what he
had woven the day before

 days went by and formed into
weeks the warehouse robbery was
not mentioned in the news then those
who had lost their treasure began a new
agitation there were letters in the
papers and melicks name began to be
used in terms of reproach

  one morning the district attorney an-
nounced that owing to melicks dere-
liction he would himself take up the
matter

  the next day the ambitious gentle-
man received in his mail a letter in-
closing a letter the handwriting was

crude he read the inclosed first he
was bewildered aild amused by the silly
lovesick treacle of it he read the
letter attached to it it informed him
with distorted syntax and spelling that
the inclosure was a copy of one of his
own letters found in a trunk in the stor-
age warehouse the trunk belonged to
an actress famous for the number and
fervor of her love affairs on and off the
stage

  the district attorney turned again to
his letter it had a sadly different look
in the cold perspective of time it be-
gan

  oh my wonderful my only souls own
soul-

  the letter on his desk warned him
that the writer of it held alarge bundle
of these billy dooz and that the sam-
ple was the mildest of the lot the
writer advised the district attorney to
mind his own business and leave the
warehouse case alone otherwise the
letters would be sent to lieutenant
melick the newspapers and to others
who might enjoy them

  in the next days papers the district
attorney announced in a feverish inter-
view that having discovered important
clews he was to devote all his time to
stamping out graft among the alder-
men

  and thus by the old strategy of
meeting fire with fire memling escaped
disaster-at least for the time being

  refreshed by the sense of liberty he
attacked the bust with ardor and fin-
ished it with genius in full flight mrs
worthington was so rejoiced at the suc-
cess of it that she sent for the best
bronze founders in america and or-
dered it cast in perennial form mem-
ling thought that some day he might
put it into marble himself and mr
worthington offered to send him to
italy for the purpose nellie volun-
teered to go along

  mr worthington would gladly have
sent him to a yet warmer region and
nellie would have insisted on going
along-even there

there will be more stories about memling in later issues of the popular
 the fight of the fire control

by edwin balmer
author of the battle below the water the third arm etc

             how a great duel between battleships was won by a mao
             with a pair of glasses and twenty feet of wire high in
             the air and five tnilei from the guns which he directed

ships ill column the signal flags
flew from the mast of the neiv
york the american flagship

       the wireless crackling out in the
cabin behind the bridge and below it
confirmed the flags battle order num-
ber four the wireless waves flashed
while the fresh pennants hoisted to the
peak were breaking out to the breeze

  from the halyards of the mighty su-
perdreadnaught wyoming eight hun-
dred yards ahead over the pale green
surface of the caribbean sea the an-
swering pennant fluttered its acknowl-
edgment against the sky eight hun-
dred yards ahead of the wyoming the
sister-superdreadnaught texas also ac-
knowledged and repeated the signal for
the ships still farther forward in the
column-the oklahoma nevada and
pennsylvania

   directly astern the flagship the utah
already had acknowledged the signal
behind it in battle position at intervals
of eight hundred yards followed the
remaining five battleships of the amer-
ican fleet-the georgia florida and the
michigan the arkansas and the north
dakota so the twelve most powerful
battleships of the navy steamed in col-
umn all cleared for action all watching
the twelve ships of the enemys column
slowly converging closer and closer all
waiting-with turrets turned and guns
trained and every man at battle sta-
tion-for the final battle signal

   for twelve ships of the enemys fleet
--the same in power in armor and in

guns-had survived undamaged the at-
tacks of the destroyers the submarines
the aerial craft at twenty thousand
yards to the east-for so the range
finders now gave the distance between
the fleets-the american officers could
not clearly distinguish the order in
which the ships of the same type
steamed in the opposing column it was
clear only that as in the american fleet
the newest and most powerful of the
superdreadnaughts led with the flag-
ship steaming sixth to be in command
in the center

  as in the american line the enemys
battleships had shaken off their attend-
ant cruisers colliers supply and repair
ships beyond the line of the dread-
naughts and behind it the auxiliaries
steamed far off by themselves a dozen
destroyers and a few swift scout ships
of ach side darted back and forth be-
tween the battleships but they haz-
arded no attack they kept well out of
range of the enemys guns under
water somewhere the submarines of
either side might lurk high above the
smoke haze of each fleet and above the
mast tops monoplanes flew with their
scouts but both sides already had
spent the strength of their subordinate
attacks with equal damage done-
four ships of each fleet either sunk or
dropped from the battle line-both col-
umns closed for the finally decisive
blows of dreadnaught against dread-
naught turret against turret gun
against gun

     this series of stories of the navy began in the first february popular back numbers at the news
stands
the fight of the fire control



  a light breeze blew up from the
south and the equator-scarcely a
breeze indeed only a doldrum zephyr
it added to the wind of the moving
ships only enough to bear away a little
more swiftly the smoke from the fun-
nels-enough if it blew during the next
hour to clear the powder haze a little
sooner from the guns but it could not
stir the warm surface of the sea the
only waves washing across it came from
the cutwaters and the churning screws
of the ships which had steamed ahead

  steadily the american ships steered
toward the south and a little to the
east as steadily the enemys ships in
column steered south and a little west
before both fleets-but still beyond the
horizon-lay venezuela to possess
which the enemy had come to protect
which the american fleet offered battle

  directly overhead so high now at
noon that it gave no advantage to the
ships in either column the glaring
equatorial sun blazed down heating the
armor and the bared decks and rais-
ing from the sea surface the thin
transparent film of water vapor which
confused with refractions the calcula-
tion of the fire-control officers determin-
ing the decreasing range from every
american ship but to the same de-
gree it must trouble the enemy also so
the conditions of the great battle-the
first great engagement between fleets of
modern ships of war of equal power-
remained equal

  the american admiral scanning the
enemys column through his glass
recognized it

  no opportunity to-day to maneuver
with nelsons or togos tactics to gain
superior concentration of fire is there
he said grimly to the captain of the new
york on the bridge beside him they
seem to have at least as much speed as
we have theres no part of their col-
umn upon which we can bring a su-
periority to bear before that part can
be supported

  but neither is there a part of our
column upon which they can concen-
trate sir

  the admiral lowered his glasses
no if i cant put my ships across the

head of their column at least they cant
cross us so we must fight evenly ship
to ship superiority in individual
handling of ships and ingenuity in bat-
tle emergencies must decide this battle

  he glanced an instant overhead to
where from the forward mast to the
tall steel mast aft the antennae of the
wireless installation stretched from it
his glance descended to the lee of the
bridge away from the enemys ships
there protected by the superstructure
from gun fire from the port beam
stretched three shorter wires joined and
secured as wireless antennae farther
astern another set of these short wires
secured independently showed the
admiral gazed at them with a question
and then away from them to where the
swift cruiser salem carrying a wide-
winged biplane on its forecastle deck
and another astern steamed a thousand
-ards off the new yorks beam and
nearer to the enemys fleet

  it would be strange to have twenty
feet of spare wire per ship win the
battle wouldnt it he appealed to the
captain but if we win decisively i
think thats what will do it his gaze
still rested upon the salem

  beside the biplane on the salems
forecastle deck poised on a launching
runway an aviator in hood and close-
fitting suit examined and tested wires
and levers up and down the deck
from the biplane to the bridge where
the salems lieutenant commander
stood young lieutenant sterret paced
impatiently

  what do you make the range now 
he asked the commander again

  eighteen thousand yards

  that means almost nineteen for our
fleet

  the younger officer glanced keenly up
and down the long column of american
ships stretching two miles and a half
forward more than three miles astern
he looked to the enemys ships steam-
ing in a similar six-mile column ten
miles off to the east and looked back
to the american ships and longingly up
to the fire-control stations on the tops
of the nezv yorks masts his normal
battle station was in such a mast top of


the tovulatr magazine

a dreadnaught as chief fire-control
officer in the foretop his part in battle
was the vital part of spotting the
strike of the shells fired from his ships
turret guns

  the lieutenant commander on the
salems bridge appreciated the appeal
of such a battle station to the younger
officer beside him

  wishing you were up there now
he nodded to the flagships foretop

  sterret shook his head they gave
me the chance but well maybe im
going to be only a spectator in this fight
but then maybe- he broke off

  seventeen thousand yards the of-
ficer at the range finder announced the
decreasing distance

  sterret strode forward to the biplane
on its launchingway over the forecastle
he bent and felt under the lower plane
where the trailing antennae of a light
wirejess apparatus were coiled to be
dropped when the machine was in
flight

  sixteen thousand yards the range
was announced and now fifteen

  at the head of the column the lead-
ing ships were coming close to battle
range flags flew from the new york
ordering the accompanying cruisers and
destroyers back of the battle line as
the salem steered astern of the flagship
and at the order took position so far to
the lee that no chance ricocheting shot
from the enemy might strike it sterret
saw that the destroyers accompanying
the other column also were scurrying to
cover a few of the american aero-
planes still flew back and forth over-
head  a few of the enemys still at-
tempted sallies but their light bombs
even when dropped with effective aim
now caused not even confusion on board
the battleships with the tops of the
funnels fendered the little bombs fell
all but harmless on the great armored
ships the men upon the dreadnaughts
waiting half naked at their battle sta-
tions were steeled now to the shock of
the fourteen-inch shells so soon to
strike

  at the head of the american column
the pennsylvania leading had come
into range of the ship at the head of

the enemys column-the superdread-
naught zeus a single gun from the
forward turret of the pennsylvania
flashed with fire and then hid itself in a
yellow haze of powder gas simul-
taneously a spurt of spray splashing up
just astern the pennsylvania told at the
same instant-or the instant sooner for
the haze already was clearing from the
zeus forward turret-the enemy had
fired their shot to try the range and
now as sterrets eyes still rested on the
zeus a - splash of spray whitened the
sea before it-how far before it or
how far on either side sterret could
not see from the deck of the salem
but the men in the fire-control tops of
the pennsylvania saw the salvo of
the pennsylvania twelve fourteen-inch
guns erupted--the whole broadside
fired together

  the second ship in the american line

-the nevada-now saluted the posei-
don second of the enemy with a spurt
of spray alongside and then the roar
of all its guns and now the okla-
homa engaging the xerxes thundered
into the action the texas and wy-
oming joined the two flagships-the
new york and the vulcan fought
abreast broadside to broadside their
guns battered and bellowed the haze
of the powder gas and smoke cloud-
ing up and concealing the fluttering
flags but without need for signal now
the battle jumped from ship to ship
down the column till every hull in the
battle line seethed with its powder
smoke and shivered and shook from
the shock of its own salvos and blazed
and staggered with the strike and ex-
plosion of the enemys shells

  sterret standing on tiptoes with his
glasses pressed to his eyes searched
with cold-sweating terrible tenseness
for the effect of these detonations on
the decks of the american ships
swiftly glancing as the smoke of each
salvo cleared from the turrets he
shouted to the aviator at place at the
biplanes engine before him and the
clatter of the motor explosions at his
ears added to the thunder of the guns

  to the head of the column he
bawled to the pilot as he took his seat
the fight of the fire control



the nevada is getting it awfully to
the head of the column opposite the
nevada

  the compressed-air cylinder to give
speed for the throwing of the biplane
forward into the air catapulted them
up with the propeller whirring madly
the plane caught the air and drove for-
ward sterret bracing himself in his
seat beside the pilot glanced below as
the biplane rose to see that all was
clear and released the coil into which
the wireless antennas wrere wround
weighted the wires dropped and
stretched at full length trailed below
and behind as the aeroplane shot for-
ward the motor now muffled ceased
the pounding clatter of its exhaust
from below with more thundering det-
onation as the biplane rose roared the
broadsides of the smoke-seething ships
sterret searching them out with his
glasses dropped the binoculars and let
them hang by their strap about his neck
with both hands he fixed over his ears
the padded microphone receivers of the
light wireless apparatus before him
with one hand then he reached for-
ward and touched the sending key on
the strut before him with the other he
held his glasses to his eyes and looked
down at the line of the american ships

  almost directly below him now he
saw the nevada smothered with the
smoke of its own salvos staggered with
the shock of the poseidons bursting
shells the turrets and the armored
positions as he saw them during the
seconds when the powder haze was
blown away seemed still undamaged
the guns were firing at the interval
for each salvo evenly regularly but
all above the turrets was shattered by
the poseidons shells the foremast was
fallen and crumpled in a heap of wreck-
age over the crushed and riddled fun-
nels  the bridge and the superstructure
behind it was shot away the aftermast
still stood-or at least the lower half
of it but the top where the fire-con-
trol officers had been stationed was
sheared off ragged supports stuck up
the after fire-control station as well as
the forward was gone

  turn toward the poseidon ster-

ret bawled to the pilot at his side
turn so i can see the poseidon
and the biplane circling showed him
the second ship of the enemys column
miles abeam the nevada smothered also
in smoke as its guns fired but when
that smoke blew off sterret could see
that the enemys ship had ceased to
suffer

  in the first moments of battle clearly
the shells of the nevada had struck with
terrible effect one turret of the posei-
don was entirely out of action a great
gap showed toward the bow where the
shells of one of the nevadas broadsides
must have struck almost together but
now the poseidon though fighting but
four turrets to the nevadas five
fought them deliberately coolly with
triumphant certainty with pitiless preci-
sion the forward mast of the posei-
don was down but from theafter fire-
control top the enemys officers were
directing the strike of the shells beating
and battering into the nevadas vitals
while the shells from the american
guns splashed two hundred yards be-
yond the poseidon and a point astern
it into the sea 

  sterrets fingers trembled on the
wireless sending key

  nevada he abbreviated swiftly his
call dowrn two hundred one right
he vibrated off the correction for the
guns

  with the battleships masts gone the
main wireless antennse of course were
down but with the two emergency
strings of wires connected with the fire-
control station behind the armor there
was at least a chance for one string to
have been left undamaged and for the
nevada to hear the salvo now firing
would tell him its cloud concealed the
nevada the shells were flying below
him he turned to watch them again
he saw fountains of white spray spurt
up from the sea the shells again had
missed but they were nearer the bat-
tleship had heard his correction

  nevada down fifty one-half
right he sent his second signal to
guide the gunners another cloud of
smoke shut out the american ship the
detonation of the poseidons shells


the popular magazine

striking on the nevadas deck echoed
up after the roar of the salvo but now
the american shells in turn struck again
on the poseidon

  he signaled it the smother of the
next salvo from the nevada shut out
the american ship

  borton bring me nearer the posei-
don sterret called to the pilot with
his wireless signals he could govern the
guns of the nevada from five miles
away as well as from one and if he
flew more nearly over the poseidon he
could more closely spot the strike of
the american shells

  he came so close that he clearly saw
the whole broadside from the nevadas
turrets crash into the sides of the po-
seidon now a salvo missed the shells
fell short they detonated only as they
ricocheted up from the sea and struck
the enemys armor

  instantly sterrets fingers com-
manded nevada up fifty and in-
stantly again came the terrible con-
cussion of the nevadas shells bursting
aboard the enemy another instant of
cool precise direction and a mighty
shock which the biplane felt high up
above the poseidon puffed the air up
and lifted the flying machine then
dropped it a dozen feet through a
vacuum and puffed it up again as the
planes caught the second blast from
the explosion below

  the forward magazine of the posei-
don reached by the last broadside of
the nevada had blown up the after
turrets firing their last shells in final
defiance clouded the stern also with
smoke now as the smoke blew off
that stern was lifting the shattered for-
ward part flooded by the inrushing sea
was sinking farther and farther up
the stern lifted till the rudder and
screws showed to the men in the aero-
plane overhead

  nevada cease firing enemy is
sinking sterret flashed mechanically
already the american fire had ceased
the water about the sinking poseidon
was spotted with figures swimming
 away from the ship more dotted it
each instant now with a rush and
great suck and draw of the water about

it the battleship slipped father and
farther down a final great gurgle a
splash a burst of bubbles a rush of
steam a seething swirling white whirl-
pool of water and the superdread-
naught poseidon was gone as sterret
stared down from far overhead while
the aeroplane bore him away he saw
only swimming specks bits of wreck-
age a last burst of bubbles

  he gazed fascinated at his little
sending key and the short string of thin
wires trailing below the fragile biplane
by him up there high in the air and
five miles from the guns he directed
that duel between the two dreadnaughts
had been won-one man a pair of
glasses and twenty feet of wire had
made the vanquished victor and over-
come an advantage of armor and guns

  he gazed about at the rest of the bat-
tle at the head of the american col-
umn the powerful pennsylvania was
continuing its duel with the enemys
equally powerful zeus down the long
columns of ships the other ten smoth-
ered themselves with the smoke of their
broadsides the only gap in the ene-
mys line below the biplane was the gap
made by the sinking of the poseidon
no gap yet appeared in the american
column-only the nevada steaming
second showed itself clearly un-
clouded to him-without masts with-
out funnels or superstructure but still
with even keel with turrets apparently
undamaged with engines speeding to
reenter the action it lacked only an ad-
versary

  the pennsylvania was at least hold-
ing its own against the zeus if any-
thing it was outfighting the enemy its
masts still stood its broadsides fired
quickly evenly at the interval for the
salvo its engines kept it abreast the
zeus it needed no help just astern
the nevada the oklahoma also fought
at least on equal terms gun for gun
it matched the xerxes but the okla-
homas masts still stood the xerxes
were tottering soon its fire control
must fail clearly the enemy had no
scheme of emergency fire control no
aeroplane hovered between the xerxes
and the oklahoma the american ship
the fight of the fire control



was in ho danger but the next ship
of the american column-the texas
opposed to the more powerful sargon-
showed signs of the greater distress

  the forward mast still stood upon the
texas it was not failure of fire con-
trol but less gun power-ten guns
against twelve at the outset of the duel
-which was beating the texas ster-
ret flying back between the fighting col-
umns could see that the shells of the
six guns which still were in action were
striking the sargon but the enemy still
was fighting twelve guns against them

  the officers of the nevada too saw
it already either from the captains
decision or orders from the flagship
the nevada was dropping back the
pennsylvania beam to beam with the
zeus steamed on and fought its duel
far ahead a gap where the nevada
had been opened in the american col-
umn to match the gap left by the po-
seidon the nevada as it dropped
back fired at ihe xerxes sterret
watching the effect of the fire signaled
his correction of the aim so that a few
broadsides struck the xerxes but the
nevada now dropped behind the okla-
homa left the xerxes to it and turned
its own guns on the sargon

 none too soon since sterret had
observed the sargon the few minutes
before the enemys ship had all but
overwhelmed the weakening texas with
its terrible salvos silencing still another
turret of the american ship so that
four guns only now fought back from
the texas and the remaining fire-con-
trol mast of the texas bent and bent
farther and farther till suddenly with
the men from the top leaping from it
into the sea the mast fell and crum-
pled into the wreckage on the deck
the sargon fired one more broadside
into the vessel then the enemy turned
their guns to the nevada which now
within range had commenced to fire

  confidently and with the assurance
of triumph it seemed to sterret the
sargon fired its first trial shot at the
nevada and then thundered out its
broadside with masts and funnels gone
the nevada must appear as a battleship
beaten already in any fight at great
ia

range if the officers of the sargon had
seen the victory of this mastless wreck
over the poseidon they had not under-
stood it they could see the first shells
from the atevada splash far ahead of
them and over into the sea at the long
range and without masts the nevada
should not except by accident aim
much better but

  down three hundred two left
sterret saw the miss and flashed the
order for the gunners high above the
battle and hardly a mile away from
the sargon-ho could spot the effect of
the fire closely certainly t-x he
flashed to the texas now after its four
guns had fired to aid the rescuing ne-
vada tt-x up one hundred one
right

  the nevada boomed its broadsides
the sargon smothered itself in its own
powder smoke the texas firing
again burst its shells aboard the sargon
as the nevadas broadsides too were
striking and it seemed to sterret now
as the sargon erupted its next salvo
that the sound of the guns was ragged
with the gunners surprise instantly
the shock of the nevadas shells again
assailed the enemy ten seconds later
the texas again hit so twelve guns
to twelve-for two of the nevadas
ten were not firing-the ships fought

  sterret watching for both american
ships and flashing to each the effect of
each salvo had no time to glance toward
the rest of the battle with need to
keep his eyes fixed constantly on the
sargon to spot the fall of the shells he
could not even look to see the effect of
the enemys fire on the nevada near-
est he understood hazily from the
shouts of borton that in general the
battle of the other ships down the col-
umn seemed equal and he knew from
the terrible precision with which the
twelve guns he was directing were
firing that the sargon could not last
much longer if these guns could keep
up their fire and he could continue to
control them

  the enemy seemed not yet to realize
what he was doing even the officers
of the poseidon did not sense it while
he hovering over them was sinking


the popular magazine

their ship the enemys aeroplanes
merely dashed back and forth on futile
bomb-dropping sallies and scouting
service they gave chase to the
american aeroplanes flying out on the
same errands but so far at least they
had neglected the biplanes which were
destroying their battleships because
sterrets machine and the others bear-
ing the other fire-control officers to aid
the ships farther down the american
column did not try to drop bombs or
attempt any direct attack of their own
the enemy had disregarded them but
now as sterrets machine hovering
over the sargon as it had hovered over
the poseidon was bringing upon it the
fire of apparently helpless ships the
enemy seemed to begin to suspect

  borton at sterrets side suddenly
yelled a warning he swung his plane
and circled up careless of whether or
not he shut the sargon from the sight
of fire-control officer sterret unable
to see the fall of the american shells
ceased to signal as borton yelled
again to him he pulled his rifle from
its holster

  a monoplane was rushing at him
the man in it beside the pilot was firing
his rifle sterret heard the bullets cut-
ting the fabric over his head he saw
one cutting a strut beside him he
raised his rifle and swiftly fired back
but the monoplane came on and be-
hind it another the rifleman in the
first was reloading sterret reached for
his clip of cartridges also to reload
below him his glance caught the sar-
gon he saw splashes all about-the
great wthite spurts of spray sent up
from the sea by a fourteen-inch shell
striking the water so the gunners of
the far-off nevada and texas no
longer able to see from his eyes their
shots strike were beginning to miss
again for every cartridge sterret
fired from his rifle a fourteen-inch shell
was being wasted by his ships below
and those ships were being laid helpless
before the sargons guns yet to save
those ships he must save himself

  the rifleman in the first monoplane
was firing at him again and the plane
had come very close the rifle shots

wtere cutting through the wing fabric
singing off the wires or the metal of
some support below him a swift
stinging pain burned in his leg and told
sterret he himself had been hit he
saw borton bleeding the red smeared
all over his cheek but the man kept
the biplane steady and sterret waiting
for the monoplane to come closer now
that the other mans rifle was empty
again fired coolly and the attacking
machine tipped as it came on sterret
saw the pilot fall forward his weight
on the levers he saw the rifleman
reaching to support the other drop his
rifle and seize the control levers from
the dead mans hands but the plane
already had tipped too far it dived on
and down toward the sea passed be-
neath the american biplane and
dropped out of sight

  sterret reloading looked for the sec-
ond monoplane wrhich had been follow-
ing btft now another american ma-
chine sent to sterrets aid was dash-
ing toward the other monoplane and
beating it back

  hastily sterret searched for the
sargon on the water below him he
found it and saw it still surrounded by
the spurts of spray sent up by american
shells wasted in the sea he saw the
sargon firing confidently again at the
nevada and beating it four guns
only now were being fought from the
nezada four from the texas and the
fire of all eight was wild useless

  t-x up one hundred two right
he called again and again for further
elevation and right deflection but now
though his fingers trembled constantly
at his signaling the american ships still
spent their shells in the sea

  can all their antennae be shot
away sterret cried aloud cant
they hear

  in that moment of his helplessness to
aid his ships below the strangeness-
the incredible quality-of his aid came
to him and made him question his use-
fulness was it possible that he in
that aeroplane five miles from the
american ships and flying far above
the battle was indeed controlling those
american guns-raising them lowering
the fight of the ftre control



them swinging them to right or left
so that their shells struck home how
could it be that upon him five miles
from the guns the battle could turn
couldnt it have been coincidence that
when he had begun sending his direc-
tions before the gunners had begun to
find their mark now he was signal-
ing again and he gained no- effect he
was sending his corrections constantly
but the guns still fired into the sea

  somethings the matter with your
spark it isnt the same borton
shouted to him

  sterret testing it worked over it
feverishly the wire to the antennae is
cut he cried he tried to reach down
to it and all but fell from the plane

  you cant fix it here  ill take you
down for it the pilot pulled him
back circling to descend

  he shut off the motor and volplaned
in the sudden silence of the soaring ma-
chine the roar of the battle boomed and
resounded with echoing thunder they
soared down to a height above the sea
at which the shells from the fighting
ships traveling on their seven-mile
trajectory were rifling past then
they had dropped below the path of the
shells the biplanes pontoons skimmed
and came to rest on the sea sterret
stepping down on them and swimming
under the machine caught the connec-
tions of the antennae and twisted them
together he scrambled back to his
seat the biplane circling up past the
shells showed sterret the ships

  one turret only now fought from the
nezrada the sargon having battered it
to all but helplessness was swinging its
guns back to the texas which still was
firing its four futile shots in return
sterret swiftly estimated the distance
of their splash and signaled he would
know in an instant now whether he
really had aimed those guns the ne-
vada had fired again he watched for
the strike of the shells and saw that
they hit the texas had fired before
the nevadas shells had struck and
now its shells also hammered on the
sargon he flashed the result of the
firing to the two ships and again and
again their shells hammered

  and the sargon could stand little
more hammering off at the head of
the column the giant pennsylvania and
the zeus seemed to have shattered each
other to helplessness without either
striking its flag each awaiting the re-
sult of the rest of the battle unable
further to influence that result but
nearer the oklahoma now had entirely
silenced the xerxes the american ship
with two turrets still able to fight was
swinging back to bear any needed aid
to the texas and the nevada farther
down the column where other amer-
ican fire-control officers had flown be-
tween the ships to govern the amer-
ican guns when needed the result of
the battle showed the same

  the ship fighting the north dakota
at the very end of the american col-
umn no longer was in sight it had
sunk two others already had struck
their colors the enemys flagship alone

-the v id can-still fought but amer-
ican ships from the rear of the column
steamed to aid the arezv york as the
oklahoma was steering to reenforce
against the sargon so hopelessly
overwhelmed at the same instant the
last of the enemys ships ceased firing
the american gun fire ceased the
commander of the zens acknowledging
the general rout showed a white flag
to the pennsylvania the enemys ad-
miral from the vulcan signaled the
surrender

  sterrets biplane slid gently to the
sea and skimmed along it dowrn the
narrowing lane between the battleships
as the victors closed to aid the beaten
ships

  the sun still glared down from al-
most directly overhead it was not an
hour later than when the first gun was
fired now of the enemys twelve great
battleships two already were on the sea
bottom two more seemed soon to fol-
low  the other eight were riddled rent
and battered hulks listing as they lay

moss morse and remorse

i eaving aside the fact that frank p morse is a marvelous press agent and
has an imagination which keeps him bumping his impressionable head against
the starry dome of heaven he is a crude performer all of which is proved thus
when henry miller and miss ruth chatterton were playing in boston mr
morse who was their press agent incurred the admiration love and affection of
one of the leading florists of the town by slipping him at judicious intervals and
in profuse quantities passes to the show as a result of this miss chatterton
received one night a box of flowers so big that it broke the back of the man who
tried to carry it into her dressing room the blossoms were done up in moss
and were of every known variety they attracted th attention of the whole
company

    where did you get the flowers asked miller

    from mr morse replied miss chatterton

    ah said miller-and that was all he said

    the following night the same thing was enacted

    on the third night a still larger box of flowers was carried into the leading
womans dressing room when it had been opened miss chatterton began to
unroll the tissue paper she did it so well that she unwound approximately a
mile and a half of it there were no flowers but at the bottom of the empty
box was a card bearing the following inscription in mr millers handwriting
just to show that he was on to morses empty homage

him mr bowles and he accepts this cognomen though it irritates her he informs her that her tales of
the far west have inspired this trip of his and that he is bound for los angeles dixie contemptuous of
this suede new yorker loada him up with wild stories of ranch life when she bids him farewell at
albuquerque the western girl is fairly choking with laughter at bowles gullibility but her gayety
changes to sudden gravity at finding him upon chula vista station it means that he has deliberately
followed her dixie may promptly gives him his conge but alias bowles is not to be dismayed after
a weeks training in chula vista he rides over to the money bug ranch and applies for a job as cowboy
the father of dixie receives him curtly and tells him that he cannot take him on under any circumstance
unabashed alias bowles insists persists until henry lee is nettled and engages him on the promise that
he will prove himself by riding a notorious man-killing horse though this agreement is not carried out
alias bowles suffers much under the hazing given him by his cowboy companions who are led by hardy atkins
chief broncho twister dixie may pointedly ignores bowles the new life is hard and unsympathetic still he

things are secondary to the discharge of hardy atkins and his cohorts through leaving their posts and get-

the deposed straw boss and hardy at-
kins shot a look at her which was both
confession and appeal

  and you john she continued se-
verely

  yes maam spoke up red john
upon whom the severity of her man-
ner was lost i was drunk all right
well you dont need to be proud
of it she said cuttingly its no dis-
tinction in this bunch brig were you
drunk too

  no maam responded brigham
promptly

  oh whats the use of talking
scoffed dixie glancing at his swollen
face and bloodshot eyes

  all the same i wasnt denied
brigham boldly i reckon youd look
kind of bug-eyed if youd been standin
guard all night

  wtell whats the matter with your
face then she demanded did the
ground rise up and hit you

  no but an old cow did over in the
shippin chute and brigham drew
himself up and grinned defiantly it
was not often that he had a chance to
assume this high moral pose and he
decided to make the most of it

  thats right interposed henry
lee who so far had let his daughter
do all the talking brig and bowles
stood guard all night and brought up
the remuda in the morning i wont
forget that brig he added significant-
ly im looking for men i can trust
well good for you brig com-
mented dixie may smiling with sudden
approval and at that the other suitors

fell into a black rage of jealousy and
distrust there was silence for a while
and then red john spoke up

  mr lee he said i know i was
drunk last night-my own fault of
course-but heres the proposition
you got to take on somebody to do
yore work whats the use of hirin
these town bums when you can git
yore old hands back thats the way
we stand and i hope youll give us a
chance

  this was a long speech for red and
he wiped the sweat from his brow as
he waited for the answer the rest of
the unemployed rumbled their acquies-
cence to the statement and watched
for some sign of weakening but henry
lee did not change his frown

  im looking for men i can trust
he said at last these boys here stayed
in camp and were on hand to help with
the shipping maybe some of them
aint quite as good cowboys as you are
but i can depend on them not to turn
my remuda loose the first night and
leave em alone and im going to make
them top hands you fellows get the
top mounts and forty-five a month he
added glancing briefly at brig and the
faithful few most of whom were nest-
ers boys and married men working
for a stake and i want some more
just like you

  but how about us inquired red
john after a silence ill take on for
a green hand mysef-forty dollars-
and ride bronks too and i know that
upper range like a book

  sure  murmured the rest and once
more they waited for henry lee

  he sat for a while studying on the
matter and then he exchanged glances
with his daughter

  if he takes you back are you going
to run it over these other hands and
make a lot of trouble she asked

shrewdly because if you are-

  a chorus of indignant denials an-
swered this unjust accusation and
dixie lees face became clear

then id take em back she said
no i wont do it rapped out
henry lee but ill tell you what i
avill do he went on as the gang lopped
alias bowles and the far west



clown despondently you boys liave
got your time checks all right you
go uptown and cash them in and if you
can pay your saloon debts and get out
of town sober ill take you on but if
an man takes a drink or brings out a
bottle hell never ride for henry lee
again ive lost enough horses through
drunken punchers brig ill leave you
in charge of the outfit

  he swung up on his horse as he
spoke and dixie rode away after him
followed by the admiring gaze of all
hands and the cook henry lee was
a good boss but the average texas
cow-puncher is not weak-kneed enough
to court the favor of any man once
he is fired he takes his money and
spends it philosophically but in this
case dixie may had intervened and
rather than lose their chance with her
the whole gang had taken lessons in
humility

  shes all right observed red john
wagging his head and smiling as he
watched her oft she wraps him
around her little finger

  wonder how she come to be down
here inquired a new hand and jack
answered him with a laugh

  ridin herd on the old man of
course he said

  sure grumbled hardy atkins
the old lady is up there too thats
the one thing i got aginst henry lee
-hes been a booze fighter and quit
thats what makes him so dog-goned
onreasonable

  they say john b gough and sam
jones was reformed drunks too com-
mented poker bill sagely but there
was one member present who did not
take even  philosophical interest in the
discussion it was brigham clark the
new straw boss through a chain of
circumstances a little hard to trace he
had refrained from his customary pe-
riodical and behold of a sudden he
was elevated above all his fellows and
placed in a position of authority

  well he broke in sharply its git-
tin dark whos goin to relieve that
horse wrangler bill buck well
ill put you on the first guard anyhow
only way to save you from yoreseves

  aw listen to the big fat stiff
commented buck buchanan who felt
the need of a nap but brig paid no
attention to his remarks

  you boys bring them into the pen
for a drink he ordered with pompous
circumstance and hold them out on
yon flat who wants to stand second
guard jim hank he craned his
neck about as hardy atkins had done
the night before and hardy who had
been thinking about other things sat
up with a sudden scowl

  whars that feller that refused a
drink this evenin  demanded brig
imitating with roguish accuracy the
broad texas accent of his predecessor
hes the boy fer second guard-good
and reliable-comes from texas too
mr atkins ill ask you and yore cot-
ton-picker friend red john to kindly
stand second guard bud and bill
third and sam and slim fourth im
boss now and i dont stand no guard

chapter xvii
brighams squirrel story

  the upper range of the money bug
was a country by itself to reach it
they rode due north from chula vista
following an old road that had been
fenced so many times that gloomy gus
became discouraged twisting and
turning driving around through new-
made lanes or jerking a world of sta-
ples and laying the wire on the ground
he toiled on in the wake of the out-
fit which was rounding up spare cor-
ners of the unfenced range behind
him came the horse wrangler and his
helper doing their best to keep the re-
muda out of the barbed wire and jerk-
ing up more fence with their ropes than
gus laid down with his nail puller
certainly in that wide windmill-dotted
valley the open range was a thing of
the past it was only thirty feet to
water and the nesters were settling
everywhere

  one more day like that observed
gloomy gus as he threw together a
late supper and i quit

  me too chimed in the wrangler
and the punchers felt much the same


the wpular magazine

  a few more years like this last
remarked henry lee gazing gloomily
out across his former estate and well
all quit but thank god they cant
farm the black mesa

  on the second day they turned east
crossing the boggy river and mounting
up on a great plateau and then bowles
saw why henry lees remark was true
the black mesa was high and level
with a wealth of coarse grass on the
flats and wooded hills behind but hills
and flats alike were covered with a
layer of loose rocks that made the land
a wilderness even the wagon road on
which they traveled was a mere rut
across the rock patch and from a dis-
tance it looked like a ruined stone wall
where the rocks had been thrown to
both sides and the rocks were black
-a scorched volcanic black with
square corners and uneroded edges that
gashed at the horses ankles deep-
cut canons wound tortuously across the
level mesa their existence unsuspected
until the rider stopped at their brink
and hidden in their sullen depths the
scant supply of water was lost to all
but the birds

  yet to the cowboys the landscape was
cheering for there was bunch grass be-
tween the rocks and not a house in
sight it is hard to please everybody
in this world but cowboys are easily
pleased all they want is a good horse
and plenty of swing room and a land-
scape gardener couldnt make it better
to bowles the lower valley had been
a wild and unsettled country but he
found that even the black mesa was
tame to these seasoned nomads

  jest wait till i take you to the white
mountains said brig as he rode by
his side this country has all been
fed off till theys nothin much left
but the rocks-no game nor nothin
but the sierra blancas are different
thats them over that far ridge

  he pointed at a filmy point of white
half lost between the blue of the pine-
clad mountains and the blue of the sky
beyond and bowles heart leaped up
at the sight at last he was in the
far west-that strange elusive coun-
try of which so many speak and which

is yet so hard to find-and the untrod
wilderness lay before him the sierra
blancas home of the deer and the bear
and the wolf and the savage apache
indians even in his age and time
there was still a wilderness to conquer
and the terrors of the old frontier to
stir the blood

  how far is it he inquired his
eyes questing out the way and when
brig told him he reached over and
clutched his hand brig he cried
i want to go there id like to go
right now

  he looked across at his partner but
brigham did not answer and bowles
knew what was in his mind

  of course now that youre made

foreman-he began but brig smiled

a cynical smile

  dont you let that worry you none
he growled the way these texicans
is takin on i dont reckon ill last
very long hardy atkins is the leader
of this bunch and hes bound to git his
job back im jest holdin on fer spite
but how can he get it back pro-
tested bowles mr lee told me you
were one the best cowmen he ever
knew and you certainly know the range

all right-

  yes but that aint it put in brig
heres the proposition  henryk lee is
gittin old he cant be his own wagon
boss forever and hes lookin round
fer a man the man that gits the job
will git more than that-hell marry
dixie lee

  oh nonsense cried bowles why
should he 

  dont know why answered brig-
ham doggedly only thats the way
it always goes-and hardy he wants
dixie

  but surely after the way he con-
ducted himself down at chula vista
it-

  oh thats nothin asserted brig-
ham

  you think she would marry him
dont know grumbled brig
shes got us all aguessin all i know
is i wont last long as straw boss ydu
wait till we git up in the mountains
where old henry cant git no more
alias bowles and the far west



hands and then watch the fur begin to
fly didnt they all eat dirt to git took
back fer green hands didnt you see
em talkin it over all they got to do
now is to git us fired and then theyll
be the top hands huh  thats easy 

  the second in command would say
 more but a few days gave token of
the coming storm as they pulled in
at the upper ranch where cowboys and
station men did duty all the year
the stray men from other outfits threw
in with them again and increased their
number to a scant twenty bar seven
was there after a return to his own
headquarters and several of the other
men but the men who dwelt in the hills
were of a different breed with hair
long and beards scrubby and overalls
greasy from lonely cooking and they
looked at bowles askande

  whos that feller they asked and
the answer was always the same if they
asked it of a texan

  oh thats a young english dude
they said hes got his eye on dixie

  strange how these men of the fron-
tier were so quick to read his heart
alias bowles had talked with dixie lee
only twice in a month but they had
read him like a book or perhaps it
was just plain jealousy since they
too had their eyes on dixie-jealousy
and a sneaking knowledge that he had t
a chance to win they cast apprais-
ing glances at his expensive saddle his 
silver-mounted spurs and eleven-dollar
stetson and hated him for his prosper-
ity  they watched him work in the cor-
ral and scoffed at him for his horse-
manship  and when he talked they lis-
tened to his broad as his soft rs
and his purling ers with wonder and
contempt not that they listened very
much for they took pains to break in
on him as grown folks do when a child
is speaking but they curled their lips
at his coming and exchanged glances
behind his back and finally as the work
progressed their hostility began to take
form

  for three days the outfit lay at head-
quarters while fresh horses were caught
and shod and here hardy atkins and
his followers suffered the humiliation

of losing their mounts as top hands
they had taken the pick of the remuda
the fleetest runners the gentlest night
horses the best-reined cutting horses
but now in the reapportionment they
found themselves reduced to skates
and bronks three davs of shoeing

o

the skates and especially the bronks
did not tend to sweeten their tempers
any and as they moved up to warm
springs and began to rake the range
the spirit of rebellion broke loose

  warm springs lies at the bottom of
a gash in the face of the mesa and
the cow trails lead to it for miles
above there is no water below it is
shut in by the rim of the canon and
the cattle file down the long trail day
and night consequently the near-by
grass is fed down to the roots and the
remuda had to be held up on the high
mesa all day the horse wrangler
grazed his charges in distant swales
bringing them in for water and the
horse changing morning and noon  and
at night the cowboys wratcned them be-
neath the cold stars-that is when they
kept awake

  on the second morning three horses
were missing the next day twro more
and on the next eight horses more were
gone and several men were practically
afoot

  who let those horses get away 
demanded henry lee as he rounded
up his night herders by the corral

  not me said the members of the
first squad

  we never stopped ridin said the
second guard

  they was gone when we come on
said the third guard

  and the fourth guard swore they
were innocent

  well somebodys been asleep-
thats all i know said henry lee
and he sent off two mountain men on
their best mounts to trail the runaways
down and bring them back then he
listened to the mutual recriminations of
the night herders and guessed shrewdly
at who was at fault for when the
night herders get to quarreling among
themselves waking each other up
ahead of time and sleeping on one


the popuur magazine

hand till it slips and wakes them up
that is a sure sign and precursor of
greater troubles to come and it calls
for an iron hand even as he was lis-
tening a row broke out in the round
corral where the cowboys were roping
their mounts

  turn that hawse loose roared
brigham suddenly mounting up on the
fence

  i will not retorted the voice of
hardy atkins from within

  he belongs to my mount protest-
ed brigham with appropriate oaths

  i dont care whose mount he be-
longs to snarled the ex-straw boss
dragging the horse out by the neck
you top hands mash your ear all night
and let my hawses drift and then ex-
pect me to walk you bet yore boots
that dont go ill take the best i can
find you cant put me afoot

  ill put you on yore back rum-
bled brigham dropping truculently
down from his perch if you try to
git gay with me you may be from
bitter crick texas but you got to
whip me before you break into my
mount

  well hes got the money bug brand
on im sulked atkins thats all i
know and as long as theys a hawse
left in the remuda--

  here here said henry lee walk-
ing inon the squabble whats all this
about  what are you doing with brigs
hawse hardy why dont you ride
your own 

  well these nester kids and mor-
mons went to sleep on guard and let
my top hawses pull now i got nothin
but bronks to ride

  well ride em then commanded
henry lee severely and another
thing mr atkins-next time youve
got a grievance come to me dont try
to correct it yourself

  he regarded his former straw boss
with narrowing eyes and atkins roped
out a bronk but in the evening he took
the first occasion to pick a quarrel with
brigham they were gathered about
the fire in the scant hour between
branding and first guard and brigham
was telling a story as was his cus-

tom henry lee had pitched his teat
on one side for he never mixed with
his men and brig had the stage to
himself

  well you fellers talk about gittin
lost he was saying you ought to be
up in that malapai country we had
a land sharp along-claimed to know

the world by sections-and he-

  aw what do you knowr about the
malapai country  broke in atkins
rudely you caint even lead a circle
on the black mesa and git back to
camp the same day my hawse give

out this mornin tryin to-

  say interposed brigham peace-
ably you know what the boss said
this mornin-if you got any grievance
tell it to him im tellin these gentle-
men a story

  a dam lie would come nearer to
it sneered hardy curling his lips
with spleen and at the word brigham
rose swiftly to his feet

  if youre lookin fer trouble mr
atkins he said taking off his hat and
laying it carefully to one side you
dont need to go no farther and if
you aint he cried suddenly advanc-
ing with blood in his eye you take
back what you said or ill slap yore
face off

  the astounding ease with which he
got a rise out of his adversary seemed
to take all the fight out of hardy at-
kins and he mumbled some vague
words of apology but brigham was
hard to mollify

  well thats all right he grumbled
it aint my fault if you go on a drunk
and lose yore job and it aint my fault
if the boss makes me straw but dont
you try to crowd me hardy atkins
or ill make you match yore words
the man never lived that can call me
a liar and git away with it and ill
thank you to let me alone

  he went back and sat down by the
fire puffing and panting with the vio-
lence of his emotions but as he gazed
thoughtfully into the fire and no one
interrupted his mood he fell into a
cynical philosophy

  mighty funny about these tee-
hannos he said glancing around at the
alias bowles and the far west



respectful company they say back in
texas when a man gits where he can
count fifty they set him to teachin
school and when he can count up to
a hundred he gits onto himsef and
leaves the cussed country ordinary
folks kin only count to twenty-ten
fingers and ten toes like an injun its
sure a fine country to emigrate from
he looked about with a superior
smile and buck buchanan took up the
cudgels for texas

  they tell me brig he said that
them mormons down on the river caint
talk no mo-jest kinder git along by
signs and a kind of sheep blat they
have

  nope answered brigham they is
sech people but they dont live along
the heely them fellers youre think-
in of is in the goat business they
dont say baaa like a sheep they go
maaa like a goat ive heard tell of
them too it seems they dont wear
no pants nothin but skirts they live
on them goat ranches back in western
texas

  he paused and looked around for
appreciation but only the nester kids
smiled

  i was drivin a bunch of strays
down through that mormon country
one time explained buck buchanan
thats where i got the idee thats
a great country aint it brig lots
of houses too i remember i stopped
one time at a street crossin and they
was houses on all four corners they
was a lot of kids playin around and
i asked one of em whose houses they
were and he says my fathers

   how comes yore father to have
so many houses i says does he
rent em 

   no sir the kid says he lives
in em dont you know him hes
the bishop 

  a roar of laughter followed this bru-
tal innuendo but brigham was not set
back his mind had become accus-
tomed to all such jests

  aw youre jealous he grunted
and let the gentiles rage until as the
talk ran on he gradually assumed the
lead

  thats one thing youll never find
around a mormon town he began
still speaking with philosophical calm
youll never find no texican of
course a mormon has to work and
that bars most of em at the start but
i dunno--seems like the first settlers
took a prejudice aginst em i remem-
ber my old man tellin how it come that
way-course they must be mistaken
but the mormons think a texan aint
got no sense

  it seems the mormons wras the first
folks to settle along the heely and
my grandpaw was one of the leaders
he killed a lot of injuns believe me
but one day when he was gittin kinder
old and feeblelike he got a notion in
his head that he wanted a squirrel skin
and so he called in my father and
said

   son you take yore rifle and go
out and git me a gray squirrel and
be careful not to shoot im in the head
because i want the brains to tan the
skin with

  so my father he went up in the
pines and hunted around but the only
squirrel he could find was stickin his
head over the limb and rather than
not git nothin he shot him anyhow
well he brought him back to the old
man and he said to im

   im mighty sorry dad the squir-
rels was awful scarce and rather than
not git any i had to shoot this one
through the head

   oh thats all right the old man
says you got a nice sin anyway
and i reckon we can fix it somehow
i tell you what you do-theys a bunch
of texans camped down by the lower
water you go down and kill one of
them and mebbe we can use his
brains 

  brigham paused and looked around
with squinched-up twinkling eyes and
at last buck buchanan broke the dra-
matic silence

 well he demanded roughly
whats the joke

  well sir ran on brig you
wouldnt hardly believe it but my old
man had to kill six of them texicans to
git brains enough to tan that squirrel

skin thats why they wont take em
into the church

chapter xviii

the rough riders

  brigham clarks squirrel-skin story
was not calculated to build up the en-
tente cordial with texas but brigham
was no trimmer the only kind of
fighting he knew was to stand up and
strike from the shoulder and a few
cracks about mormon marital customs
had not tended to lighten the blow
numerically he was outnumbered by
the texans but when it came to a con-
test of wits he did not need any hep
he went off to bed now laughing and
to all of bowles chidings he turned an
unheeding ear

  let em roar he said its no skin
off my nose them fellers has been
cavin round and givin off head long
enough-i sure capped em in on that
all right well let em rough-house me
if they want to-theys two can play at
that game i never seen the texan yet
that looked bad to me-and if they git
too gay the boss will fire the whole ca-
boodle i aint lookin fer trouble but
no bunch of ignorant texicans can run
it over me umph-umm 

  so the feud went on and when dixie
rode into camp with the mail she
smelled war in the very air the men
walked past each other with the wary
glances of fighting dogs and even her
little comedy at the delivering of the
letters failed to visibly lighten the
gloom a private interview with the
cook who carefully kept out of the ruc-
tion and gave neither side comfort nor
succor revealed the fact that the situa-
tion was serious and with the success
of the round-up at stake dixie may
was quick to act when her father re-
turned to his dog tent at supper time he
found her war bag inside and with a
mount of horses cut out for her dixie
lee took on for a cowboy

  they were up on the cedar ridges of
the mountains now driving down wild
steers from the upper pastures and a
woman was as good as a man dixie

was better than most for she had rid-
den those rough mesas before and could
drift off a ridge like a blacktail her
desperate rivalry in the chase fired thf
hearts of the most malingering and
more than one mossheaded old outlaw
found himself outgeneraled and flogged
into the herd and a steer is a steer
these days-he is worth as much as a
horse

  every morning as the punchers set
out on the long circle dixie may picked
out a man to dare and several prairie-
bred texans failed to follow her over
the rocks mounted on the best horses
in the remuda knowing the ways of
wild cattle and the lay of the land
ahead she took after the first puff of
dust she saw and followed it till she
smelled smoke if her steer turned
back she ran him down and roped him
and if her escort did not show up that
time she hog-tied her catch and went
on it was a wild free life and she
threw herself into it recklessly glorying
in the unholy joy of beating them vat
their own game she rode with brig-
ham and hardy atkins uncouth moun-
tain men and rawboned nester kids
and finally when the time was ripe she
picked on bowles

  alias bowles was mounted on his top
horse wa-ha-lote and he rode proudly
along behind brigham for in the rough
and tumble of cross-country running he
was holding his own with the best

  a bunch of wild cattle sprang up sud-
denly from their hiding place on a far
point for a moment they stood staring
their ears silhoueted against the sky
and the keen eyes of the straw boss read
their earmarks like a book

  theres two money bug steers in
that bunch he said head em off
bowles and drive em down the
canon

  then bowles leaned forward in his
saddle and raced them for the high
ground he headed them and they
doubled to beat him back once more
he headed them off while the outfit
went on with its circle and just as they
stopped to look him over again he saw
a horse coming down on his right it
was dixie mounted on her favorite
alias bowles and the far west



roan and she motioned him to swing
around on the left then the riding be-
gan all over again for the steers were
wild as bucks and they knew every trail
on the bench but the shod horses were
too fast for them on the rocks and as
their hoofs began to get hot from the
friction they turned and dashed for the
rim

  from the high ridge where the circle
was led to the bottom canon where the
hold-up herd lay the land fell away in
three benches each a little narrower
each a little steeper at the jump-off-
and bowles and dixie lee went over the
first pitch hot-foot on the heels of their
quarry they raced back and forth on
the second terrace trying to head the
cattle down a natural trail but now a
wild self-destroying panic came upon
them and they took off over the rough
ground

  ill dare you to follow me cried
dixie turning her eager roan after
them and helter-skelter over the rough
rocks swinging and ducking under trees
and jumping over bowlders and bushes
she went spurring after the cattle be-
hind her came bowles his eyes big with
excitement staring at her madcap rid-
ing with the fear of death in his heart
down over the rough jump-off they
went the dust and smoke from friction-
burned hoofs striking hot in their faces
as they rode and by the grace of god
somehow they reached the bench be-
low

  dont ride over there he entreated
as the cattle scampered on toward the
last pitch but dixie laughed at him
loud and shrill

  will you take a dare she taunted
raising her quirt to strike and before
bowles could say a word wa-ha-lote
grabbed the bit and went after her like
a rocket whatever his master thought
it was outside of wa-ha-lotes simple
code to let any horse give him his dust
wild with terror and excitement the
big steers made straight for the jump-
off which was high and steep over they
went with dixie after them and then
like a bolt from behind wa-ha-lote
leaped over the rampart and went plow-
ing down the slope twice he jumped

as he came to dikes of rock and
bowles stayed with him like a hurdler
then with a lightning scramble over the
loose stones he took the trail from the
roan and went pounding down the hill

  tree limbs reached down to brush
bowles off sharp stubs threatened mo-
mentarily to snag his legs and bowlders
to dash his brains out if he fell but the
lion-hearted wa-ha-lote had asserted
his mastery and bowles could only
hang on at the bottom of the slide
they crashed through a dead-limbed
cedar sending the bone-dry sticks flying
in every direction and when alias
bowles swung up into the saddle he
was thundering across the flat and the
steers were at his bits vague wisps
of smoke white and smelling like a
blacksmith shop leaped up as the har-
ried brutes skated over the rocks and
bowles knew that his battle was won
once in the soft sand of the creek bed
they would never turn back to the
heights for their feet were worn to the
quick but it had been a hard race-
even wa-ha-lote was slowing down
and dixie lee was nowhere in sight

  j sudden doubt assailed bowles and
he tugged sharply at the bit he pulled
down to a walk and looked behind
then as he saw no sign he stopped sorr
and let the cattle go for a tense minute-
he listened while wa-ha-lote puffed like
a steamboat then with a grave look
on his face he turned and rode back up
the hill

 oh miss  lee he shouted
dixie

  and a thin answer came from the
slope above

  catch my horse it said hes
down in the gulch

  bowles stared about and caught sight
of the red roans hide as he stood be-
hind some trees then with his rope
about its neck he went spurring up the
hill

  dixie lee was lying very awkwardly
among the rocks at the foot of a sorubby
juniper and at the first glance bowles
knew she was hurt not only was her
hat gone and her stout skirt ripped and
torn but her face was very pale and her
lips drawn tight together

ing him with a fleeting smile hurt my
knee right bad first time ive known
him to do that-say help me out of
these rocks

  very tenderly alias bowles reached
down and raised her to her feet then
with one arm about his neck she tried
to hobble away but at the second hop
she paused

  nope-hurts too bad she said
put me down

  but bowles did nothing of the kind
he took her up in his strong young
arms and carried her down the hill
he even wished it was farther but she
spied a bed of leaves under a cedar
and ordered him to put her there
then she looked up at him curiously
and for a while lay verr still

  what you got there she inquired
as he came back holding his hat and
bowles showed her a crownful of water
that he had brought from a pool in the
gulch

  ah sighed dixie and drank out of
it without scruple long and deep
say that good she said now
pour some on my hands-theyre all
scratched up he did that too and
loaned her his neck handkerchief to sop
up the last of the wet

  well its a wonder you wouldnt
ask a few questions she observed at
length bathing her grimy face with the
handkerchief  howd it happen or
howre you feeling or something like
that

  she smiled naturally at him now
fluffing out her dark hair that hung like
an indians in heavy braids and bowles
face lighted up and then flushed a
rosy red

  i see you are feeling better he said
sitting down off to one side and dec-
orously regarding his wet hat so how
did it happen

  well began dixie ruefully in-
specting her torn hands all i can re-
member is feeling myhorse going down
and jerking my feet out of the stirrups
-then i fetched up in that juniper i
scrabbled out the minute i struck-
afraid old rufus would fall on me-

and thats where i hurt my knee-i
bumped it against a rock 

  she felt the injured limb over care-
fully and shook her head

  im afraid i cant travel on that for
a while she said so get me your
coat to put under it and prop it up and
well talk about something pleasant
itll be all right i reckon after i rest
a while but that fall certainly jarred
me up

  say she observed as bowles came
back with his coat that was pretty
good wasnt it what i was telling you
the other day-about nursing you back
to health and strength looks like
youre the nurse the way it turns out
but youre going to make a good one
she went on as he tucked the coat un-
der her knee i can see that now
most people when you get a hurt or a
fall or something they come rushing
up to where youre making faces and
ask a lot of foolish questions-are you
hurt and did you fall and all that
until you want to kill em but you
havent hardly said a word

  no said bowles blushing and
looking away im awfully sorry you
fell-hope i didnt make you is there
anything more i can do 

  oh thats all right she assured
him we all take a fall once in a
while i feel kind of weak and trifling
right now-but dont go no i want
you here for company

  alias bowles had risen up on a pre-
text of looking after the horses but
dixie lee was firm

  no you stay she said as he ex-
plained that she might wish to be alone
youre out west now bowles and
you remember what hardy atkins told
you-if a lady asks you to take a let-
ter take it of course that was none
of hardys business but thats the rule
out here and i want you to come back
and sit down no not away over there
-i wtant you right up close

  bowles came back as readily as a dog
but he did not sit very close for some
reason unknown to himself he assumed
that she would be embarrassed not only
by their isolated position but by the in-
timacies which had arisen between them
alias bowles and the far west



moved by a strong and humane pur-
pose he had gathered her up in his
arms and carried her down the hill but
hardly had he felt her arm about his
neck her breath against his cheek and
her heart against his breast when the
dimensions of his world had suddenly
narrowed down and there was only
dixie lee and him and now he was
still dazed and breathless afraid of him-
self and not trusting in his strength-
and yet he would do anything to please
her

  come on over here she coaxed
patting the leaves by her side and
bowles came as near as he dared now
tell me some stories she said settling
back and closing her eyes ah this
will be fine-tell me something interest-
ing so i can forget that knee it sure
aches-when i think about it-but i
believe theres something in mind cure
go ahead and talk whered you learn
to ride so well

  oh that beamed bowles do
you think i can ride well im not so
bad over the rocks you know i used
to ride to the hounds we chased foxes
through the woods leaping stone walls
and five-bar gates and all that and
really i used to enjoy it nothing like
cow-punching of course but great
sport all the same i remember once
we were out at clarendon-

  he fell into the details of a fox hunt
-the first time he had spoken of his
past life-and dixie was careful not to
interrupt him then he told of his life
in the military school where they taught
boys the cavalrymans craft and dixie
lay quiet and listened if her knee hurt
she did not know it for she was piecing
out his career school college country
club one after the other he alluded to
them but even in his boyish enthusiasm
he was careful to mention no names
and as he wandered  with his stories
dixie lee wondered who he was cer-
tainly no inconsiderable man in his own
country and yet here he was an or-
dinary hired hand punching cows for
forty-five a month but why and if
he had followed her to the end of the
world to win her heart why did he not
talk of love to her now that they were

there together and when he had
taken her in his arms when he had car-
ried her under the tree and pulled off
her boot and tucked his coat under her
knee why had there been no caress no
look  unnecessary attentions to show
that he really cared dixie may
opened her eyes and gazed out at him
through half-closed lashes and some-
how she liked him better-he seemed to
be different from the rest

  mr bowles she said at last
youre an awfully interesting man but
there are some things i cant under-
stand theres something mysterious
about you i know you must be all
right because i met you at mrs mel-
vines but at the same time youre hid-
ing out like an ordinary horse-stealing
texican what are you up to any-
way 

  why i thought you knew all about
that explained alias bowles the old
baffling smile coming back into his eyes
dont you remember i told you about
it on the train

  yes i remember all right an-
swered dixie but yon did  tell me
very much-and then you toid me dif-
ferent at chula vista i thought i had
a line on you once but youre too deep
for me whats this i hear about a
girl

  a girl repeated bowles with
questioning gravity why what do
you mean what did you hear

  a girl back in new york con-
tinued dixie glancing at him shrewdly
as she hazarded a guess-and as she
gazed he flushed and looked away

  wtiatever you have heard he said
at last i have nothing to be ashamed
of-would you like me to get you some
water 

  aw mr bowles cried dixie re-
proachfully are you trying to side-
step me on this

  no indeed  replied bowles settling
back with masterful calm what is it
you have heard-and what would you
like to know

  he paused and regarded her ex-
pectantly and dixie saw that she was
called a shadow passed over her face
a shadow of annoyance and of suspi-


the popular magazine

cion perhaps as well but she felt the
rebuke of his frankness and pursued
her inquiry no further

  well perhaps you are right she
said as if answering an unspoken re-
proof it was nothing to your dis-
credit mr bowles and i am sure it is
none of my business i guess im kind
of spoiled out here-i get to joshing
with these cowboys until i dont know
anything else i believe i would like
that drink

  bowles leaped up promptly at the
word and came back with his new hat
full of water he held it for her to
drink and as she finished and looked
up she saw that his eyes were troubled

  oh dear she cried impulsively
have i made you any trouble youve
been so good to me here-what have i
gone and done now

  oh its not you at all he assured
her and then his voice broke and he
faltered but have you really heard
from new york

  why no mr bowles soothed
dixie laying her hand on his arm
not a word-i dont know anything
about you-i was only making it up
oh said bowles and drew his arm
away he looked out at the horses for
a moment poured the water out of his
hat and turned back his old smiling
self

  how is your knee now he asked
kindly do you think you can ride
i suppose we ought to be going pretty
soon

  dixie glanced over at him and her
heart sank-she had observed these sud-
den changes in bowles before and even
his boyish smile could not lighten the
veiled rebuke when bowles had
thoughts that were antisocial he was
always unusually kind and his way of
expressing disapproval was to tactfully
change the subject and now he wras
talking of going dixie scowled and
felt of her knee and rose stiffly to her
feet

  well if youre in such a hurry
she sulked but bowles was at her side
in an instant

  oh my dear miss lee he cried
catching her as she poised for a limp

please dont do that let me carry
you when the time comes but we will
rest as long as you please

  he passed a compelling arm about
her and lowered her gently to her
place then he sat down beside her and
breathed hard as he set her free

  really he murmured we dont
seem to understand each other very
well miss lee

  thats because neither one of us is
telling the truth observed dixie with
acertain bitterness they sat for a mo-
ment in silence and then she turned
about and looked him squarely in the
eye

  mr bowles she said in measured
tones who are you anyway 

  who-me parried bowles lapsing
into the vernacular why you know
me im bowles the gentleman you
met at mrs melvines

 there you see commented
dixie youre afraid to tell your own

name and im-

  yes questioned bowles

  well i dont know what im afraid
of she went on bluntly but ive got
something on my mind

  why surely began bowles appre-
hensively i-i hope i havent given
offense in any way you were hurt
you know-and i was a little excited-
and-

  oh thats all right said dixie
heartily youre a perfect gentleman
-i always knew that but you havent
had much to do with women have you
mr bowles

  her voice trailed off a little at the
close and bowles looked up at her
mystified he thought quickly won-
dering where she was leading him and
decided to tell the truth

  why no miss lee he stammered

i suppose not i hope i havent-

  oh no no cried dixie i dont
mean that i was just thinking-well
i -mustnt take advantage of you then
she favored him with one of her sud-
den tantalizing smiles and his brain
whirled as he looked away

no he muttered taking a deep
breath it wouldnt be fair you know
well go and cinch up my horse
nuns bowles nnd the fm west



then she said and ill make an ex-
ception of you

  he looked up at her suddenly star-
tled by the way she spoke and went to
do her will

 now he announced when the
horse was ready shall i help you while
you mount

  why yes she said if you think
its safe

  and then he gathered her into his
arms

  i ll be careful he said but the
devil tempted him-and dixie forgot
and smiled

  never mind she whispered as he
lifted her to the saddle that was to
pay you for being nurse

chapter xix

a common b r a w l

  there is a madness which comes to
certain people at certain times and
makes them forget the whole wtorld in
such a moment alias bowles had stolen
a kiss-for the first time in his life-
and dixie lee had forgiven him he
had stolen it quickly and she had for-
given him quickly and then they had
ridden on together without daring so
much as a glance that kiss had meant
a great deal to both of them and they
needed time to think so they rode
down to the hold-up herd in silence and
parted without a word

  dixie went on to camp to rest and
care for her hurts and bowles with a
sad and preoccupied smile stayed by to
help with the herd but the jealous
eyes of hate are quick to read such
smiles and as bowles rode along on
the swing he was suddenly startled out
of his dreams hard- atkins went out
of his way to rule past him and as he
spurred his horse in against his stirrup
he hissed

  you leave my girl alone you blank-
ety-blank  and went muttering on his
way

  this roused bowles from his reverie
and he began to think if hardy atkins
had noticed a change there were others
who would do the same how atkins
 a

had guessed or what the clew had been
he could not tell but having been care-
fully brought up bowles knew exactly
what he ought to do before the first
rumor had run its course it was his duty
as a gentleman to go to henry lee and
make a report of the facts then if any
exaggerated statements came to his ears
later mr lee would know that his con-
duct had been honorable and that
green-eyed envy was raising its hateful
head so without more ado he rode
up to the point of the herd and saluted
the austere boss

  mr lee he said as that gentleman
turned upon him sharply i am sorry
but miss lee had a very bad fall this
morning and she has gone ahead to
camp

  yes i saw her returned the boss
what about it

  well-i was afraid she might not
mention it to you or minimize her
hurts but as a matter of fact she fell
on a steep hill and if it hadnt been for
a juniper tree she might have been seri-
ously injured as it is her knee gave
her quite a lot of trouble and i had to
help her to mount

  oh commented henry lee and
glanced at him again well what is
it he inquired as bowles still rode at
his side

 excuse me stammered alias
bowles holding resolutely to his task
i thought perhaps you might want to
ride ahead and help her off her horse

  for a moment the boss looked him
over then he grunted and bowed quite
formally

  yes thank you mr bowles he
said will you call hardy to take my
place 

  he waited until hardy atkins had
started and then put spurs to his horse
and when the cowboys reached camp he
was busy about the tent

  the next day dixie did not ride out
on the round-up and when they came
back she was gone back to the home
ranch the cook reported and he added
that she was not very lame but the
cow-punchers glared at bowles as if he
had crippled her for life and not only


the popular magazine

that but as if he had done it on pur-
pose

  these blankety-blank tenderfeet
commented hardy atkins by the fire
they can make an outfit more trouble
than a bunch of apache indians i
caint stand em-its onlucky to have
em around

  id rather be short-handed any
time observed buck buchanan sagely

 now theres dix continued
hardy with a vindictive glance at
bowles worth any two men in the out-
fit-ride anywhere-goes out with this
hyer tenderfoot and comes within an
ace of gittin killed she raced with
me rode with red and slim and left
the straw a mile-the hinglishman
comes in behind her crowds her outer
the trail and if it hadnt been fer that
juniper shed a landed in them rocks
alias bowles looked up scornfully
from his place and said nothing but
brigham appeared for the defense

  aw what do you know about it
he growled you wasnt there who
told you he crowded her out of the
trail 

  well he says so himsef protested
atkins pointing an accusing finger at
bowles didnt he come into camp
and tell all about it i believe that he
was tryin to do it so he could git a

chance to-

  mr atkins said alias bowles ris-
ing to his feet and speaking trem-
ulously i shall have to ask-

  but that was as far as he got with
a tigerlike spring the ex-twister was
upon him and before he could raise his
hands he struck him full in the face

  you will talk about my gal will ye
he shouted as bowles went down at the
blow stand up hyer you white-liv-
ered hinglishman  ill learn you to butt
in on my game 

  here whatre you tryin to do
demanded brigham leaping up hastily
and confronting his old-time enemy
you touch that boy again and ill
slap yore dirty face off

  well hes been gittin too important
around hyer cried atkins noisily
and hes been talkin about my gal-
i wont take that from no man

  huh sneered brigham drawing
closer and clenching his hands youre
mighty quick to hit a man when he aint
lookin-why dont you take a man of
yore size now and hit me 

  i aint got no quarrel with you
raved hardy atkins thats the fel-
ler im after-hes been talkin about
my gal

  he has not replied brigham delib-
erately he never talked about no gal
and ill whip the man that says so-
are you bad hurt pardner

  he knelt by the side of the prostrate
bowles who opened his eyes and stared
then he looked about him and raised
one hand to his cheek which was
bruised and beginning to swell

  ill learn you to cut me out
taunted hardy atkins shaking his fist
and doing a war dance ill make you
hard to ketch if you try to butt in on
me

  aw shut up snarled brigham lift-
ing his partner up youre brave
when a man aint lookin aint ye 
here ketch hold of me pardner and
ill take you to yore bed 

  bowles dropped down on his blankets
still nursing his aching head but in the
morning he rose up with a purposeful
look in his eye he was a long way
from new york and the higher life
now and that one treacherous blow had
roused his fighting blood for the cour-
age which prompts a man to strike in
the dark he had little if any respect
and he went straight over to hardy at-
kins the moment he saw him alone

  mr atkins he said you hit me
when i wasnt looking last night next
time you wont find me so easy-but be
so good as to leave miss lees name out
of this

  oho taunted the cow-puncher
straightening up and regarding him
with a grin so you want some more
hey that crack oil the jaw didnt
satisfy you whats the matter with
yore face this mawnin 

  never you mind about my face
returned bowles if you are so low
as to be proud of a trick like that you
are a coward and no gentleman and-
put up your hands
a lias bowles and the far west



  he squared off as he spoke falling
back upon his right foot and presenting
a long menacing left but hardy atkins
only laughed and loosened his pistol

  aw go on away he said dye
think i want to box with you  no if
you git into a fight with me youre liable
to stop most anythin-ill hit you over
the coco with this

  he laid his hand on the heavy colts
which he always wore in his chaps and
gazed upon him insolently

  you cant run no blazer over me
mr willie-boy he went on as bowdes
put down his hands youre out west
now where everythin goes if youd
happen to whip me in a fist fight id git
my gun and shoot you so keep yore
mouth shut unless you want to go the
limit and while were talkin he
drawled i think you might as well
drift-its goin to be mighty onhealthy
around hyer if i ketch you with dixie
again

  i asked you to leave her name out
of this suggested alias bowles trying
bravely to keep his voice from getting
thin if youve got a quarrel with me
well and good but certainly no gentle-
man--

  aw go on away from me sneered
hardy atkins waving him wearily
aside you seem to think youre the
only gentleman in the outfit go chase
yoreself you make me tired

  the sight of grinning faces about the
corral recalled bowles to the presence
of an audience and choking with anger
and chagrin he went off to saddle his
horse ever since his arrival hardy
atkins had ignored him glancing at him
furtively or gazing past him with su-
percilious scorn now for the first time
they had met as man to man and in that
brief minute the ex-twister had shown
his true colors he was a man of
treachery and violence and proud of it
he did not pretend to fair play nor
subscribe to the rules of the game he
did not even claim to be a gentleman
there was the crux and alias bowles
labored in his mind to find the key
how could he compete-either in love
or war-with a man who was not a
gentleman 

  it wras brigham who gave the answer
and to iiim it was perfectly simple

  well he said as they rode back
together from the circle hes warned
you out of camp-what ye goin to do
about it 

  why what can i do faltered
bowles wrhose soul was darkened with
troubles

  fight or git out replied brigham
briefly

  but he wont fight fair cried
bowles he hits me when im not
looking-then when i offer to fight him
with my hands he threatens me with a
pistol what can a man do 

  threaten im with youm returned
brigham he wont shoot-hes one
of the worst four-flushers in arizona
hes jest runnin it over you because he
thinks youre a tenderfoot

  how do you know he wont shoot
inquired bowles to whom the whole
proposition was in the nature of an
enigma what does he carry that
pistol for then 

  jest to look ba-ad sneered brig-
ham and throw a big scare into
strangers i aint got no six-shooter
and he dont run it over me does he
hes afraid to shoot thats whats the
matter-he knows very well the
rangers would be on his neck before
he could cross the line dont you let
these texicans buffalo you boy-the
only time theyre dangerous is when
theyre on a drunk

  then you mean began alias
bowles hopefully if id struck him
this morning he wouldnt have used his
gun

  well admitted brig he mightve
drawed it-and if youd whipped him
he mightve taken a shot at you but
you got a gun too aint you

  ye-es acknowledged bowles but

i	dont want to kill a man i wouldnt
like to shoot hinr with it

  well then fer gawds sake take it
off roared brigham if hed shot
you this mornin he could a got off fer
self-defense turn it over to the boss
and tell him you dont want no trouble
-then if hardy shoots you hell swing
fer it


the pocpular magazine

  but how about me

  youre twice as likely to git shot
anyway persisted brig with a gun
on you if you got to pack a gun leave
it in yore bed where you can git it if
you want it but if the other feller sees
youre heeled and hes got a gun it
makes him nervous and if you make a
sudden move he plugs you but if you
aint armed he dont dare to-theyre
awful strict out here and these rangers
are the limit hardy wont shoot-you
aint afraid of im are you

  no-o said bowles not if hed
fight fair

  dye think you could whip im de-
manded brigham eagerly

  i can try

  thats the talk cheered brigham
leaning over to whack him on the back

  stand up to im hes nothin but a
big bluff

  i dont know about that grumbled
bowles with the affair of the morning
still fresh in mind im afraid hell hit
me with his gun

  well here well fix that said brig
hastily stripping the heavy quirt from
his wrist you turn yore pistol over
to the boss and take this loaded quirt
-then if hardy offers to club you with
his gun you knock his eye out with
this

  he made a vicious pass into the air
with the bludgeonlike handle holding
the quirt by the lash and passed it over
to bowles

  now youre heeled he said ap-
provingly thats worsen a gun any
time and you kin hit im as hard as you
please jest hang that on yore wrist
where itll be handy and turn that
cussed six-shooter in

  the matter was still a little mixed in
bowles mind and he felt that he was
treading upon new and dangerous
ground but his evil passions were still
afoot and he longed gloomily for his
revenge so when they got into camp
that evening he went over to henry
lees tent with brigham to act as his
witness

  mr lee he said speaking accord-
ing to instructions ive had a little dif-
ficulty with one of the boys and id like

  to turn in my gun i dont want to
have any trouble

all right mr bowles answered
the boss very quietly just throw it
on my bed whats the matter brig
oh nothin much replied brigham
you saw it yoresef-last night

  um assented henry lee glancing
for a moment at bowles skinned cheek
well we dont want to have any racket
now boys-not while weve got these
wild cattle on our hands-and im much
obliged hope you dont have any more
trouble mr bowles

  he bowed them out of the tent with-
out any more words and they proceeded
back to the camp a significant smile
went the rounds as bowles came back
from the tent but in the morning he
went to the corral as usual

  i thought youd got yore time ven-
tured buck buchanan as bowles be-
gan to saddle up and as the word passed
around that he had not hardy atkins
rode over to inquire

  wliats this i hear he said i
thought you was goin to quit

  then you were mistaken mr at-
kins answered bowles politely i am
not

  then what did you see the boss fer 
makin some kick about me

  your name was not mentioned mr
atkins replied bowles still politely
i simply turned over my gun to mr
lee and told him id had some trou-
ble

  well its nothin to what you will
have scowled the ex-twister hate-
fully i can tell you that and i give

you till night to pull if you dont-

  he paused with meaning emphasis
and turned his horse to go but henry
lee had been watching him from a
distance and now he came spurring in

  hardy he said ill have to ask
you to leave bowles strictly alone hes
turned his gun in to me and is tending
to his own business so dont let me
speak to you again dye understand 
yes sir mumbled the cow-
puncher fumbling sullenly with his sad-
dle strings but his mind was not turned
from his purpose as alias bowles
found out that same night
alias bowles and the far west



  they were swinging around toward
the south and west raking the last bar-
ren ridges before they started the day
herd for home and in the evening they
camped in the open and threw their
beds down anywhere after a hasty
supper by the tire alias bowles spread
out his blankets coiled up his bed rope
and rode forth to stand the first guard
for bowles was a top hand now what-
ever his enemy might say and he had
his choice of guards it was very dark
when he came in at ten-thirty and he
was too sleepy to notice the change but
after he had slipped under his tarpaulin
he felt something through the bed it
was his bed rope stretched carelessly
across the middle from side to side
and he grumbled for a moment to him-
self as he squirmed down where it
would not hurt him then he went to
sleep

  after a man has ridden hard all day
and stood his guard at night a little
thing like a rope under his bed is not
likely to disturb his dreams-the way
the pea did the soft-sleeping true
princess--but with this particular rope
it was different hardy atkins had
stretched it there with malice afore-
thought  and when later in the night
he saddled his snorting night horse and
prepared to ride out to the herd he tied
the two ends into a loop and silently
stepped away with the slack then he
took a turn around the horn put spurs
to his horse and went plunging out into
the night

 a sudden yank almost snapped
bowles in two in the middle he woke
up clutching to find himself side-swip-
ing the earth then an agonizing series
of bumps and jolts followed and he
fetched up against a juniper with a jar
that rattled his teeth there was a
strain a snap and as the rope parted
he heard a titter and a horse went gal-
loping on it was a practical joke--
bowles realized that the moment he
woke up--but the terror of that first
grim nightmare wrenched his soul to
the very depths he came to cursing
and fighting still bound by the loop
of the lariat and half buried in the
wreck of the juniper then he jerked

himself loose and sprang up staring
about in the darkness for some enemy
that he could kill the titter of the
galloping horseman gave the answer
and he knew it was hardy atkins
hardy had given him till nightfall to
quit camp or look out for trouble this
was the trouble

  bowles spread out his bed as best he
could and slept where he lay till dawn
then he went to henry lee and said
he would like his gun his hands were
bloody and torn from contact with the
brush and there was a fresh welt above
one eye that gave him a sinister leer
there was no doubt about it-alias
bowles was mad-and after a cursory
glance the boss saw he was out for
blood

  just a moment mr bowles he
said advancing to the fire boys he
continued addressing the smirking
hands who stood there i make it a rule
on my round-ups that nobody carries a
gun that includes you too mr
bowles he added meaningly mosby
get me a gunny sack

  with thegunny sack under one arm
the wagon boss went his rounds and
when he had finished his trip the sack
was full of guns

  ill just keep these till we get back
to the ranch he observed and he
added the next man that picks on
bowles will have to walk to town
hardy was you in on this

  no sir  replied atkins stoutly i
dont know a thing about it

  well be mighty careful what you
do charged henry lee severely
brig throw that herd on the trail-
we might as well hit for the ranch

  when alias bowles rode back to the
money bug ranch he was a hard-look-
ing citizen his aunt the hypothetical
mrs earl-bowles would scarcely have
recognized him mrs lee started vis
ibly at sight of his battered face and
dixie smiled knowingly as she glanced
at his half-closed eye


the votpuljltr magazine

  aha mr man she said it looks
like youd been into a juniper too

  well something like that acknowl-
edged bowles gazing loverlike into her
eyes and from that he led the conversa-
tion into other channels less intimately
associated with common brawls for
though bowles had given way to his
evil passions and had even gone so far
as to call for his gun in order to beard
his rival he did not wish it known to his
lady as he contemplated her grace in
a plain white dress and the witchery of
her faintest smile it seemed indeed a
profanation of the sacred temple of
love to so much as allude to a fight
undoubtedly in the wooings of the
stone age the males had competed with
clubs but certainly for no woman like
this love as bowdes had learned it
from the poets was above such sordid
scenes and as he had learned it from
her-when she had chastened his soul
with a kiss-ah now he could sing with
old ben jonson and the deathless
greeks

    drink to me only with thine eyes
      and i will drink with mine

    or leave a kiss within the cup
    and ill not ask for wine

  here was the shrine at which he wor-
shiped and he wished no carnal thought
to enter in so he spoke to her softly
and went his way lest some one should
read his heart and break the spell with
jeering

  the dust of a days hard driving was
on his face there was a red weal over
one eye and a bruise on his bearded
cheek but he was a lover still dixie
knew it by his eyes that glowed and
kindled by his voice whose every word
veiled a hidden caress and she greeted
the others coldly from thinking of this
one who had come then she dissem-
bled and went down among them but
her ways were changed and she only
smiled at their jests

  hey dix challenged hardy at
kins at last thrusting a grimy hand
down into his chap pocket look what i
got fer ye

  we drew out a money-order ring that
he had won in a mountain poker game
and flashed the stone in the sun

  its a genuwine eighteen-carat dia-
mond he announced come over
hyer and lets see which finger it fits
if it fits yore third finger you know

what-

  well i like your nerve observed
dixie lee smiling tolerantly with
gloomy gus come over hyer eh
its a wonder you wouldnt come over
here-but i dont want your old ring
so dont come

  why whats the matter asked
hardy atkins who loved to do his
courting in public you aint goin back
on me are you dix

  well if i went very far back on
your trail answered dixie i reckon
id find where you got that ring whats
the matter  wouldnt she have it  or
did that other girl give it back

  she turned away wtith a curl on her
lips and when he saw that she meant
it hardy atkins was filled with
chagrin from a man now that would
be a good joke but from dixie-well
somebody must have blabbed he
turned a darkly inquiring eye upon
alias bowles and looked no further
but henry lee had spoken and all that
rough work was barred still there
were ways and ways and after thinking
over all the dubious tricks of the cow
camp he called in his faithful friends
and they went into executive session

  now hyer expounded the ex-
twister as they got together over the
butchering of a beef the way to bump
that there hinglishman off is to make a
monkey of im-skeer im up and laugh
im out of camp hes so stuck on him-
sef he caint stand to be showed up-
whats the matter with a fake killin 
heres lots of blood

  he cupped up a handful of blood
from the viscera of the newly killed
beef and his side partners chuckled at
the thought

  let me do the shootin and ill
throw in with ye rumbled buck
bflchanan

  ill hold the door on im volun-
teered poker bill

  well whos goin to play dead
grinned red john me all right
git some flour to put on my face and
alias owles and the far west



watch me make the fall-i done that
once back on the pecos

  so they laid their plans very mysteri-
ously and when the big poker game be-
gan that night there was no one else
in on the plot puck had the pistol he
had killed the beef with tucked away
in the slack of his belt red john had
changed to a light shirt the better to
show the blood and hardy atkins-was
a make-up man with bottled blood and
a pinch of flour in his pocket to use
when the lights went out

  the game was straight draw poker
and the prize a private horse ten dol-
lars apiece was the price of a chance
and it was freeze-out at four bits a chip
that served to draw the whole crowd
and as the contest narrowed down to
buck buchanan and red john the ta-
ble was lined three deep

  how many asked buck picking
up the deck

  gimme one said red and when he
got it he looked brave and turned down
his hand the way all good poker players
do when they have tried to fill a flush
and failed

  i bet ye ten challenged red

  go you-and ten more came back
buck

  raise ye twenty

  what ye got demanded buck
shoving his beans to the center and
then with a sudden roar he leaped up
and seized the stakes keep yore
hands off that discyard he bellowed
hammering furiously on the table

you lie you-

 whack came red johns hand
across his face and buchanan grabbed
for his gun then as the crowd scat-
tered wildly he thrust out his pistol
and shot a great flash of powder be-
tween red johns arm and his ribs

  uh grunted red and went over
backward chair and all then hardy
atkins blew out the lamp and the riot
went on in the dark alias bowles was
only one of ten frantic punchers who
struggled to get out of the door brig-
ham clark was one of as many more
who burrowed beneath the beds and
when hardy atkins lit the lamp and
threw the dim light on red johns wan

face he was just in time to save his
audience true the older punchers had
been in fake fights before but they had
been in real ones too-where the bul-
lets flew wide of the mark-and this
had seemed mighty real in fact if one
were to criticize such a finished produc-
tion it was a little too real for the pur-
pose for the conduct of alias bowles
was in no wise different from the rest
there had been a little too much se-
crecy and not quite enough teamwork
about the play but poker bill was still
at his post and the victim was caught
in the crowd

  oh red red moaned hardy at-
kins kneeling down and tearing aside
red johns coat are you hurt bad
red 

  the red splotch on his shirt gave the
answer and the room was silent as
death then poker bill began to whis-
per and push delighted grins were
passed and stilled and moving in a
mass with alias bowles up near the
front the crowd closed in on the corpse

  hes dead rumbled buck bu-
chanan making a fierce gesture with his
pistol i dont make no mistakes
you boys saw him cheat he went on
approaching nearer to the crowd and
he slapped me first you saw that
didnt you bowles

  oh hush up cried hardy atkins
tragically shaking his fallen friend and
then as he worked up to the big scene
where red john was to come to life
and run amuck after alias bowles the
door was kicked open and gloomy gus
strode in

  whats the matter with you fellers
he demanded his voice trembling with
indignation and the thought of his
broken sleep and then at sight of red
he stopped

  hes dead said hardy atkins try-
ing hard to give gus the wink-but the
cook was staring at the corpse per-
haps being roused from a sound sleep
his senses were not quite as acute as
usual perhaps the play acting was too
good be that as it may his rage was
changed to pity and he took the center
of the stage

  ah poor red he quavered going


the popular magazine

closer and gazing down upon him
shot through the heart hes dead
boys theys no use workin on jim-
ive seen many a man like that before

  well lets try anyway urged at-
kins in a desperate endeavor to get rid
of him go git some water gus
havent you got any whisky

  oh hes dead mourned the cook
theys no use troublin him-its all
over with poor old red youll never
hear him laugh no more

  a faint twitch came over the set
features of the corpse at this and
hardy atkins leaped desperately to
shield his face

  he was a good-hearted boy con-
tinued gloomy gus still intent upon his
eulogy-and then red broke down
first he began to twitch then a snort
escaped him and he shook with inex-
tinguishable laughter a look went
around the room brigham clark
punched bowles with his elbow and
pulled him back and then gus glanced
down at the corpse his peroration
ceased right there and disgust chagrin
and anger chased themselves across his
face like winds across a lake then
with a wicked oath he snatched the gun
away from buck and struggled to get
it cocked

  you young limb he raved menac-
ing red john with the pistol and fight-
ing to break clear of buck youll play
a trick on me will ye-an old man and
punched cows before you was born
let go of that gun mr buchanan ill

show the blankety-blank- and so

he raged while the conspirators la-
bored to soothe him and brig dragged
bowles outside

chapter xxi

a call

  there is a regrettable but very well-
defined tendency in human nature which
prompts the author of a miss-fire re-
venge to take it out on the dog cer-
tainly there was no more innocent party
to the inveigling of gloomy gus than
alias bowles and yet for some reason
hardy atkins and his comrades in

crime chose to gaze upon him with a
frown after laboring far into the
night they had finally persuaded the
cook that it was all a mistake that no
insult was intended to his years and
that it would be contrary to those high
principles of southern chivalry of
which he had always been such an il-
lustrious exponent to report the fake
fight to the boss then they had busied
themselves in the early morning with
chopping wood and packing water and
similar ingratiating tasks with the re-
sult that when henry lee came down
after breakfast there was no complaint
from anybody but when he had let it
pass and started off for chula vista it
was cloudy in the south for bowles

  but your true lover with the wine
of ecstasy in his veins and haunting
feminine glimpses to catch his eye is
not likely to be scanning the horizon
for a cloud the size of a mans hand
bowles troubles began that evening
when after an arduous day in the sad-
dle he returned to his own social
sphere for two months and more
alias bowles had been a cow hand he
had slept on the ground he had eaten in
the dirt and when luck had gone against
him he had learned to swear but now
as he was riding past the gate mrs lee
in a charming house gown had waylaid
him with a smile he paused for a
friendly word and his breeding had
prompted him to linger while she
chatted then she had invited him to din-
ner-not supper-and he had forgotten
his lowly part forgotten also was the
warning of hardy atkins now so sul-
len in his defeat and everything else ex-
cept the lure of dainty living and the
memory of a smile so after a hasty
shave and a change to cleaner clothes
he stepped out boldly from the ranks
and walked up to the big white house

  the chill and gusty days of early
spring had passed and the soft warmth
of may had brought out all the flowers
along the gallery the honeysuckle and
cherokee climbers were fragrant with
the first blossoms of summer and
bowles was glad to tarry beneath them
when mrs lee met him hospitably at
the stoop in the far west the tor-
nuns bowles nnd the fnr west



tugas were passing through the daily
miracle of sunset and the hush of even-
ing had settled upon all the land

  ah mrs lee sighed alias bowles
as he contemplated with a poets eye the
beauties of nature now i understand
how you can live here for thirty years
and never go back to new york such
illumination-such color  and from
the hill here it is so much more glori-
ous  really in spite of the loneliness
i almost envy you those thirty years
yes admitted mrs lee leading
him to a rawhide chair beneath the
honeysuckle it is beautiful i like it-
in a way-but still i can never forget
new york it offers so much you
know of music and art and society-
and yet well henry needed me and so
i stayed but i have tried to give my
daughter what advantages i could i
have a sister you know living in new
york-mrs elwood tupper-perhaps
you know her

  why the name seems familiar re-
turned bowles glibly

  yes shes my sister resumed mrs
lee after glancing at him curiously
dixie was with her all last winter-i
thought perhaps you might have met
her there

  once more she gazed at him in that
same inquiring way and bowles won-
dered if she had heard anything but he
was quick to elude the point

  hmm he mused tupper no i
hardly think so when i return
though i shall be glad to look her up-
perhaps i can convey some message
from you your daughter must find it
rather close and confining in the city
after her fine free life in the open
really mrs lee i never knew what
living was until i came out here of

course im very new yet-

  yes agreed mrs lee who knew a
few social sleights herself dixie did
complain of the confinement but she

- oh dixie

  yes mother replied a dutiful
voice from within

 come out on the gallery-mr
bowles is here but she met some very
nice people there-some of the real old

families you know-and i thought
-er-

  the door opened at this point and
bowles leaped to his feet in astonish-
ment it was a different dixie that
appeared before him-the same be-
witching creature who had dazzled his
eyes at the wordsworth club and she
wore the very same gown and wbat a
wonderful transformation it seemed to
make in her-she was so quiet and
demure now and she greeted him in
quite the proper manner

  i was just telling mr bowles
dixie continued mrs lee still hold-
ing to her fixed idea that you went
out quite a little in new york-and
perhaps you might have met back
there

  for a moment the two eyed each
other shrewdly each guessing how
much the other had said and then
bowles opened up the way

  why really miss lee he ex-
claimed still gazing at her with ad-
miring eyes you do look familiar in
that dress perhaps we have met in
a crush like ships that pass in the
night may i ask at what function
you wore this charming gown

  yes indeed mr bowles returned
dixie may but rather than run over
the whole list and recall a winters
agony lets take it for granted that we
met its a fine large place to come
away from isnt it-dear old new
york wasnt the slush on those side-
walks something elegant and that
steam heat my it never gets as hot
as that out here yes indeed mother
im sure mr bowles and i have met
before but she added and here her
voice changed since hes traveling in-
cognito changing his name as a gar-
ment and not getting any letters from
home perhaps its just as well not to
dwell upon the matter

  why dixie child protested mrs
lee wrhat in the world do you
mean 

  nothing at all mother except that
he is our guest shall we go in now to
dinner 

  they went in and throughout the
rest of the evening bowles was guiltily


the popular magazine

conscious of a startled mothers eyes
which regarded him with anxious
scrutiny at first and then became very
resolute and stern mrs lee had
solved her problem whatever it was
and settled upon her duty bowles felt
a social chill creep into the air as he
rose to go and he braced himself for
some ultimatum but his hostess did not
speak her thoughts there was no
further allusion to new york or his
alias or the fact that he had acted a
lie all those things were taken for
granted and he left with a balked feel-
ing as if he had failed of some pur-
pose her very silence clutched at his
heart and her passive hand touch as
they parted dixie too seemed to
share in the general aloofness she had
said good night without any friendly
grip of the fingers looking at him very
straight as if to fathom his deceit

  bowles lay awake that night and
thought it out and he saw where he
had made his mistake from the first
his manner had been evasive almost to
medacity and both with dixie and her
mother he had made a mystery of his
past now the time for explanations
was gone and he was reaping his just
reward he should have taken dixie
into his confidence when they were
alone beneath the cedars he should
have answered that question of hers
when she asked it-but now it was too
late

  mr bowles she had said who are
you anyway 

  and when he had avoided her she
had never asked again and now
through the same damnable ineptitude
he had estranged her mother and lost
his welcome at the big house xa the
explanations in the world would not
square him now for one deceit follows
another and his second word was no
better than his first he could see with
half an eye that mrs lee distrusted
him he must seem to her candid mind
no less than a polite adventurer a
neer-do-well young profligate from the
east with intentions as dark as his
past nor could he bring himself to
blame her for the inference was logical
-if a man conceals his identity and

denies his acquaintances and friends
surely there must be something shame-
ful that he is at such pains to hide

  but the way out that was what
kept bowles awake certainly if he
was a gentleman he would stay away
from the house nor would it be
wholly honorable to waylay dixie may
and explain and besides there was
nothing to explain he had references
of course but if he gave them his aunt
would discover his whereabouts--and
then there was christabel

  the memory of those prearranged
meetings swept over him and he shud-
dered where he lay dear pretty pa-
tient christabel what if she should
sense this woman-made conspiracy and
lose that friendly smile what if she
should blush as he had blushed at each
chance tete-a-tete gazing nervously into
his eyes to guess if he would yield 
and to wonder if that was love ah
no he could never do that rather
than inflict such torture upon her he
would flee to the depths of the wilder-
ness and hide until she was married
but his safety lay only in flight for his
aunt was a resolute woman with tears
and sighs at her command if all else
failed yes he must run away-that
was the way out

  and it would solve all his problems
at once there would be no lame ex-
planations to make at the house no
cheap jealousies with hardy atkins no
breaking of his cherished dream of see-
ing the west he would move on into
the white mountains and explore their
fastnesses with brigham or lacking
brigham he would plunge into that
wilderness alone

  the harsh clangor of gloomy gus
dishpan cut short his fitful sleep and
he rolled out of bed with his mind
made up to quit at breakfast he said
nothing bolting his food with the rest
of them and followed on to the horse
corral for a private word with brig
but right there fate played him a
scurvy trick and disrupted all his
schemes for as he stepped around be-
hind the corral hardy atkins strode
in upon him and made signs to certain
of his friends
nuns bowlbs nwd the fnr west



  now lookee here mr man he
said and he said it quietly for once
you been four-flushin around hyer
long enough and we give you warnin
to git we got yore record and we
know what youre after so dont hand
us out any bull yore name aint
bowles and youre aimin at dix but
shes got too many good friends now
weve let you off easy so far but gawd
hep you if we come agin aint that
so boys 

  you bet it is answered three or
four and the rest of them looked their
disdain but an unreasoning anger
swept over bowles at the very first
word and he returned the sneer with
interest

  mr atkins he said you have
threatened me before but i am not
afraid of you you cannot frighten me
away

  oh i caint caint i jeered hardy
atkins while his friends rumbled
threats from behind well poco
pronto youre- liable to change yore
mind you come into this country on
a hinglish trot and we thought you
was a sport but now that we know
better you got to make good or git
aint that so boys 

  you bet it is roared the bunch and
atkins hitched up his chaps

  all right he said you got a job
with this outfit by claimin that you
could ride now-youre so brave-
either you ride that dunbar hawse the
way you said or we kick you out of
camp you can take yore choice
very well said bowles ill ride
the horse

  yes you will sneered the gang in
a chorus but bowles did not heed their
words

  any time you put the saddle on
him he said ill ride him

  at this they stood irresolute unable
to make him out on the morning that
he had ridden wa-ba-lote he was a ten-
derfoot not knowing one horse from
another but now he had seen the worst
and yet he would climb up on dun-
bar 

  come on-lets rope im urged
hardy atkins but he did not move out

of his tracks no the boss is cornin
back he said lets wait till were
hyer by ourseves all right mr
broncho-bustin bowles well fix you
good and plenty-the first time the
folks leave the house and meantime
if you value yore health you better stay n
down on low ground

  i will go wherever i please an-
swered alias bowles but he stayed
down on the low ground

chapter xxii

  the horse that killed dunbar

  in the homeric simplicity of the cow
camps where the primitive emotions
still rule any soul-stirring which cannot
find its expression in curses is pretty
sure to seek the level of laughter the
boys were profoundly moved by
bowles declaration of intention but
after gazing upon him for a spell in
mingled incredulity and awe their lips
began to curl

  aw-him they said him ride
dunbar umph-umm wrell wake up
some mornin and find im gone

  then as a morning or two passed
and bowles was still in his place they
began to lapse into jest

  old henry will shore be sprised
when he comes back from town ob-
served blithesome red john hell
find bowles ridin dunbar with a hack-
amore and feedin him sugar from his
hand big doins soon to come boys-
boss and family goin down to chula
vista to-morrer

  well we better hog tie hinglish
then grumbled buck buchanan hell
never last till mornin gittin right
close on to that time

  never you mind about hinglish
retorted brigham clark whose loy-
alty had been fanned to a flame if
it was you buck buchanan we couldnt
see you for dust right now they aint
a man of ye dares to say hed ride dun-
bar let alone the doin of it will you
ride him second if he throws bowles
off well keep yore face shut then
the whole bunch of ye ought to be
canned fer tryin to git im killed


the popular magazine

  well let im go on away then
burst out hardy atkins we never
told im to ride dunbar-we told im to
quit his four-flushin and either make
good or git theres the road down
there let im take to it

  he jerked an imperious hand at alias
bowles who answered him with a
scowl

  if you will kindly mind your own
business mr atkins he purled i
shall certainly be greatly obliged

  he gave each word the harvard ac-
cent and tipped it off with venom for
bowles was losing his repose in fact
he was mad mad all over and at every
remark he bristled like a dog a con-
catenation of circumstances had thrown
him into the company of these texas
brawlers but he aimed to show by every
means in his power his absolute con-
tempt for their trickery and his de-
termination to stand on his rights he
had said he would ride dunbar and
that was enough-he had given his
word as a gentleman therefore he
resented their insinuations and desired
only to be left alone certainly he had
enough on his mind to keep him occu-
pied without responding to ill-natured
remarks

  fate was piling things up on poor
alias bowles and he earnestly longed
for the end there is a cynics saying
that every time a man gets into trouble
his girl goes back on him just to carry
out the run of luck and while of
course it isnt true it seemed that way
to bowles perhaps his own manner
had had something to do with it but
the morning after his rebuff dixie
greeted him almost as a stranger and
falling back shortly afterward into her
old carefree way of talking she began
to josh with the boys then she took
a long ride with brigham a ride that
left him all lit up with enthusiasm and
made him want to talk about love as a
matter of fact dixie had sensed some-
thing big in the air and was anxiously
ferreting it out but bowles did not
know about that all he knew was that
he disapproved of her conduct and
wondered vaguely what her mother
would say not that it was any of his

business but he wondered all the same
and wondering shook his head and
sighed

  but three days of flirting and sleuth-
ing brought nothing to dixies net
from the cook down the outfit was a
solid phalanx against her-they would
talk and smile but they never showed
their hand one clew and only one
she had-there seemed to be an un-
usual interest in when she was going to
town first on one pretext and then
on another they inquired casually about
the date and if her folks were going
along too so whatever the deviltry
was it was something that called for
secrecy-and it was due on the day
they left home she looked them over
as they gathered about the evening fire
and smoothed her hair down thought-
fully-and the next morning she
started for town

  the sale of his steers was making
henry lee a lot of trouble-and the
holding of them as well not being able
to find a buyer at his price he set the
cowboys to fence mending-lest the
outlaws should breach the wires-and
went back and forth to town and this
morning his wife went with him sitting
close behind the grays writh dixie rid-
ing fast behind their dust changed
tcj haze on the horizon before any one
moved a hand and then hardy atkins
turned on bowles

  all right mr bowles he said
heres where we see yore hand ill
saddle that hawse if youll ride im but
dont make me that trouble fer nothin
because if you do-

  oh shut up snapped bowles
whose nerves were worn to a frazzle
whats the use of talking about it
put the saddle on him

  wow-wee whistled atkins lis-
ten to the boy talk will you  must
have somethin on his mind-what

  well quit yore foolin put in
brigham abruptly well all git fired
fer this and him liable to git killed to
boot so hurry up and lets have it over
with

  ill go ye laughed the ex-twister
skipping off with a sprightly step
alias bowles and the far west



come on boys itll take the bunch of
us but ill saddle old dunbar or die

o-oh hits not the unting that urts the
      orses oofs

hits the aramer amraer ammer on the ard
      ighway

  he laughed and cut another caper
as he ended this bald refrain and brig-
ham glowered at him balefully

   hits  he quoted  hits lis-
ten to the ignorant cracker i never
seen a texican yet that could talk the
straight u s but go on now you low-
flung cotton pickers and ill fix bowles
fer his ridin

  they hustled away as he spoke the
best of them to wrangle dunbar and
the rest to admire the sight here was
an event that would go down in money
bug history and only the cook stayed
away life had been stale flat and un-
profitable to gloomy gus since he de-
livered the oration over red john and
the very care with which all hands re-
frained from speaking of it showed
how poignant the joke had been faces
which had looked pleasant to him be-
fore were repulsive now and in this
last attempt on alias bowles he saw
but a recrudescence of the horseplay
which had worked such havoc with his
own pride therefore he was morose
and sullen and stayed with his pots and
pans

  i want to warn you mr bowles
he called as bowles came full-rigged
from the bunk house i want to give
you warnin-thet hawse is danger-
ous

  all right mr mosby answered
alias bowles absently as he started for
the round corral

  he done killed a man croaked
gloomy gus a right good cow-
puncher too-i knowed him well jim
dunbar-the top rider of the outfit
dont say i never warned you now-
keep off that hawse

  all right mr mosby responded
bowles but he never missed a stride

 you want to set him limber
reiterated brigham in his ear ride
im like a drunk man and whip im at
every jump-it gives you somethin to
do grab im with yore spurs every

time he lights and look out he dont bite
yore legs here take my quirt-its
heavier-and if he starts to go over
backward hit im hard between the
ears you kin ride im pardner i
know it jest keep cool and dont get
stiff

  all right brig muttered bowles
all right but his eyes were on the
corral

  a cloud of dust rose up on the still
morning air like smoke from some red-
burning fire and through the poles of
the fence he could see horses running
like mad and men with trailing ropes
then as the stampede rose to a thunder
of feet he heard a shrill yell of triumph
and scrambling men jerked the bars
from the gate the current of galloping
slackened it paused and the leaders
shot out the gap with a sea of high-
flung heads behind when the dust of
their outrush had settled there was
only one horse left inside-the horse
that killed dunbar-and he lay grunt-
ing in the dirt

  fetch me that hackamore yelled
hardy atkins from where he knelt on
the brutes straining neck now bring
me that well rope-well tie up his dad-
burned leg

  they gave him the ropes as he called
for them and he rigged them with mas-
terful hands-first the rough-twisted
hackamore to go over his head and cut
off his breath then the two-inch well
rope to hang from his neck and serve
later to noose his hind foot then all
hands tailed on to the throw rope they
swayed back as he rose to his feet and
when dunba went to the end of it the
heave they gave threw him flat he
leaped up and flew back on his
haunches and the rope halter cut off
his breath his sides heaved as he strug-
gled against it his eyes bulged big and
he shook his head then with a final
paroxysm he sank to his knees and
they slackened away on the rope a
single mighty breath and he was up on
his feet and fighting and they choked
him down again then hardy atkins
stepped in behind and picked up the
end of the shoulder rope where it
dragged between his legs and drew the


the populaji magazine

loop up to his hocks a jerk-a kick
at the burn-and dunbar was put on
three legs he fought because that
was his nature but it was in vain they
trussed his foot up high tied the ropes
end to the neck loop and clapped a
broad blind over his eyes so dunbar
was conquered and while he squealed
and cow-kicked they lashed bowles
saddle on his bowed-up back and
slipped the bit between his teeth

  there he stood at last old dunbar
a man-killer sweating and trembling
and cringing his head to the blind and
bowles jumped down off the fence

  all right he said ou can let
down his foot ill pull up the blinder
myself

  say yore prayers first mr man
gritted atkins lolling and mopping his
face if hes half as good as his
promise youll never git off alive
very likely observed alias bowles
grimly you can let his foot down
now

  hey git a move on yelled a
cow-puncher up on the fence theys
somebody cornin up the road

  aw let em come drawled atkins
carelessly theyre hurrvin up to see
the show step up and look im over
he grinned at alias bowles no rush
-you got lots of time 

  let his foot down snarled alias
bowles his nerves giving way to anger

im not-

 its dix clamored the cow-
puncher on the fence top aw rats
its dix

  there was a rush for the fence to
make certain and as dixie lee dashed
in through the horse lot hardy atkins
threw down his hat and cursed then
he stood irresolute gazing first at
bowles and then at the fence until
suddenly she slipped through the bars
and came striding across the corral

  oho hardy atkins she panted as
she tapped at her boot with a quirt
so this is what you was up to--riding
horses while dad went to town didnt
he tell you to keep off that dunbar
horse well then you just--

  she paused as she sensed the tense

silence andjthen she saw bowles walk-
ing resolutely up to the horse in a
flash it all came clear to her-the feud
the fights and now this compact to ride

  mr bowles she cried raising her
voice in a sudden command-but before
she could get out the wrords hardy at-
kins laid his hand on her arm

  you go on back to the house he
said fixing her with his horse-taming
eyes you go back where you belong
im doin this

  you let go of me stormed dixie
lee making a savage pass at him with
her quirt-and then a great shout
drowned their quarrel and made them
forget everything but bowles

  the obsession of days of brooding
had laid hold upon him and left him
with a single fixed idea-to ride dun-
bar or die and to him no less than to
hardy atkins the coming of drxie lee
was a disappointment for a minute
he too had stood irresolute then with
the simplicity of madness he went
straight to the blindfolded horse and
began to lower his foot as the quar-
rel sprang up he gathered his leins
without looking back he hooked his
stirrup and then very gently he rose to
the saddle the shout rang out and he
reached down and twitched up the
blind

  gazing out from beneath the band
which had held him in utter darkness
the deep-set rattlesnake eye of dunbar
rolled hatefully at the man on his back
he crooked his neck and twisted his
malformed head and bowles felt him
swelling like a lizard between his knees
-then with a squeal he bared his teeth
and snapped at his leg like a dog the
next moment his head went down and
he rose in a series of buck jumps whirl-
ing sideways turning halfway around
and landing with a jolt and at every
jolt alias bowles head snapped back
and his muscles grew stiff at the jar
but just as the world began to grow
black and he felt himself shaken in his
seat the trailing neck rope lapped dun-
bar about the hind legs and he paused
to kick himself free

  it was only a moments respite but it
heartened the rider mightily he caught
alias bowles and the far west



the stirrup that he had lost wiped the
mist from his eyes and settled himself
deep in the saddle

  good boy stay with im yelled
the maniacs on the fence posts and then
old dunbar broke loose the man
never lived that could ride him-bowles
realized that as he clutched for the
horn-and then his pride rose up in
him and he sat limber and swung the
quirt one two three times he felt
himself jarred to the center and the
blood burst suddenly from his mouth
and nose he had no knowledge of
what was happening now for he could
not see and then with a heartbreaking
wrench he felt himself hurled from the
saddle and sent tumbling heels over
head he struck and the corral dirt
rose in his face there was a cloud be-
fore him a mist and then as the dizzi-
ness vanished he beheld the man-killer
charging at him through the dust with
all his teeth agleam

  look out i yelled the crowd on the
fence top look out and bowles
scrambled up and fell over to one side
his knees were weak they would not
bear him and through the dust cloud
he saw dunbar slide and turn again
then of a sudden he was in a tangle
of legs and stirrups and striking feet
and somebody grabbed him by the arm
three pistol shots rang out above him
-he was snaked violently aside-and
old dunbar went down like a log
somebody had killed him that was cer-
tain but it was not brigham for he
could tell by the characteristic cussing
that it was his partner who had pulled
him out and was dragging him across
the corral he blinked and opened his
eyes as he fetched up against the fence
and there was dixie lee with a big
smoking pistol in her hand striding
after him out of the dust

  she looked down at him her eyes
blazing with anger and then snapping
the empty cartridges out of the colts
she handed it back to a puncher

  well she said i hope you boys
are satisfied now and without a sec-
ond look at brigham bowles hardy
atkins or the remains of dunbar she
turned and strode back to the house

chapter xxiii

the custom of the country

  when alias bowles rose up out of
the dirt he was shaken in body and
spirit his corporeal frame felt as if
it had been passed through a carpet
beater and he had lost some of his
most precious illusions certainly if
there was any way by which a tender-
foot might hope to achieve a little hard-
earned fame in the far west it was
not by riding bronks and now before
he could wipe the blood from his nose
they were blaming him for all their
troubles

  the blank-blanked greenhorn
cursed hardy atkins pacing to and fro
and gazing at the hulk of dunbar i
toy im to keep off that hawse never
wouldve let im rode im-not fer a
thousand dollars and then the min-
ute my backs turned-and dix right
there to copper the play-he goes and
pulls off this but i dont care-
never done nothin you boys seen im
-he done it himsef 

  and then all the anger and blood lust
that had been in bowles heart for days
went suddenly to his right hand and
putting his shoulder behind it he smote
the ex-twister on the jaw it was a
wicked blow very much like the one he
had received himself and it laid the
false cow-puncher low he came up
reaching for his gun and bowles
knocked him down again and took the
gun away then he passed it on to
brigham and offered to fight him some
more-or anybody a raging devil of
combat seemed to possess him and he
shouted for war and more war the
cowboys drew away from him as from
a man who has lost his right mind and
it was not until brigham had cajoled
him into dipping his hot head in the
horse trough that bowles left off his
raving a drink of mr mosbys strong
coffee and- a rest on his bed by the
sheds and his sanity was completely re-
stored-but his illusions were lost for-
ever 

  never again would alias bowles try
to beat the cow-puncher at his own
game never would he mount a wild


the popular magazine

horse and never would he put faith in
womankind not out west anyway
to be sure dixie lee had saved him
from the man-killer but she had done it
in such a way as to injure his pride ir-
reparably

  brig he said im going to quit
this accursed ranch-would you mind
catching my private horse 

  no ner mine neither fulminated
brig i jest been waitin fer ye to say
the word-been ready mysef fer a
week

  he hopped on his horse as he spoke
and rode out into the pasture and as he
returned with their private mounts
gloomy gus came over from the fire

  what ye goin to do brig he in-
quired quit 

  yep answered brig as he lashed
their beds on his spare horse gittin
too bad fer me next thing you know
somebodyd git killed

  thets right agreed gus gloomily
gittin pretty bad around hyer cow-
punchin aint what it used to be well
im sorry to see you go 

  he put them up a lunch and watched
them off and then turned back to his
pots and kettles grumbling and shak-
ing his head

  that was their only farewell but as
they rode out the gate dixie lee ap-
peared at the big house door and looked
after them as they passed their
mounts alone told the story of their
departure and their beds on the horse
behind but though she knew they were
quitting she stood silent and made no
sign

  want to say good-by asked brig
glancing up at her from under his hat
but bowles did not reply a deadly
apathy had succeeded his passion and
he was sullen and incapable of higher
thoughts all he wanted now was to
get away-after that he could think
what to do

  they turned their horses heads
toward chula vista where they must
go to draw their time and after they
had ridden a mile bowles suddenly
turned in his saddle-but dixie had
passed inside a deep and melancholy
sadness came over him now and he

sighed as he slumped down in his seat
but brigham did not notice his silence
at noon they ate as they rode getting a
drink at a nesters windmill and at
night they camped by a well then it
was that bowles woke up from his
brooding and saw that he was not alone
in his mood-brigham too was down-
cast and wrapped up in his thoughts
his mind ran quickly back to ascertain
the cause and he remembered the cher-
ished job

  brig he said as they sat close to
their tiny fire im sorry you had to
quit if it hadnt been for me and
hardy atkins youd be back there now
on your job it might have led to some-
thing better too mr lee often said
that-

  aw fergit it grumbled brig
morosely  didnt want the job
whats the use of bein a puncher any-
way  theys nothin in it but hard
work ive got a good mind to hike
back to the gila and go to pitchin hay

  well if im in your way at all
urged bowles dont hesitate to say so
i only proposed this white mountain
trip-

  oh thats all right broke in brig
ill be glad to git away from it all-
git where they aint no girls nor mail
nor nothin up there in them big pine
trees where a man can fergit his trou-
bles but i want to go back past the
money bug i told dix all about it last
week and i shore want to bid her
good-by theres a good girl-dix-
but she cant understand she says if
i had any nerve id go and take a chance
-marry the girl and wait and see what
happened to me-my girl down on the
river you know

  alias bowles nodded gravely and
waited for him to go on it was a
month since brigham had spoken of
his girl and he had never discussed the
affair since that first rush of con-
fidences until now suddenly he dove
into the midst of it

  no continued brig gazing mourn-
fully at his dead cigarette dix is all
right but she dont know them mor-
mons like i do she dont know what
theyre liable to do this feller thats
nuns bowles nwd the fnwest



tryin to marry my girl is the bishops
own son--hes that feller i beat up so
bad when i took to the hills a while
back-and hes bound to do me dirt
my girl wont marry me nohow-not
lessen i become a mormon-and shore
as youre settin there boy if i take that
gal from the bishops son im elected to
go on a mission

  i know it haint the old man got
it in fer me  and then whats to be-
come of my wife am i goin to leave
her fer two years and that dastard
a-hangin around not on yore life-if
they summoned me fer a mission id
either take my wife along or id kill
that bishops son-one or the other
but thats the wrorst of it-the bishops
kid is on the spot and im hidin out
like a coyote my girl keeps a-writin
like she never got no letters and beggin
me to come back and be good but i
cant do it-thats all-i been a ren-
egade too long

  it was a hard and tragic problem and
long after the fatalistic brig had gone
to sleep alias bowles lay awake and
tried to find a way out his own petty
griefs seemed sordid by the side of it
and all the way to town he turned it
jiser in his mind but now that he had
dismissed it forever brigham clark be-
came his old carefree self again

  when brigham came back from his
interview with henry lee bowles
could see that his enthusiasm had been
shaken

  say he said as lie beckoned
bowles to a corner of the corral what
dye think mrs lee sprung on me when
i went around fer my pay  and by
the way they was a deputy sheriff in-
quirin fer you when i come out by the
desk so come away from that gate-
but what dye think she said

  why im sure i cant imagine an-
swered bowles with his old-time calm
what was it 

  well she had a big yeller telegraph
in her hand that she was kinder wavin
around-i never did find out what it
was all about-but when i come in to
the hotel she flew at me like and says

   mr clark do you know who that
young man is youre travelin with 
ca

  well sir the way she said it made
me mad clean through and i says to
her

   no mrs lee i dont-and whats
more i dont care hes a good pard-
ner thats all i know-and thats all i
want to know

 and then i turned around and
walked out i dont know what them
lees have got to be so proud about the
way old henry used to cave around but
i showed her by grab they was one
puncher she couldnt run it over she
always did make me mad observed
brig as he stole quiet glances at his
friend but i knowed good an well
you wasnt no crook and-and i dont
care what you done 

  well thank you just as much i
havent done anything brig answered
alias bowies with a reassuring smile
but he added thats no reason for
not getting out of town

  they packed their horse hurriedly
and bowles rode on ahead but once on
the open prairie he gave way to a
heartv laugh

  brig he said what in the world
do you think ive done

  well i dunno mumbled brig
looking him over shrewdly of course
i knowed all along they was nothin to
that christabel talk you was givin me
-stands to reason a man wouldnt leave
home fer a little thing like that about
that aunt now that sounds a little more
likely-but ive knowed fellers that
come out here jest fer fun

  yes but this deputy sheriff-and all
that

  we-ell drawled brigham with a
sly twinkle in his eye i heeard a little
more from him than what i told you
at the first

  oh indeed and what else did you
hear 

  well- brig stopped and stuck

his tongue in his cheek roguishly he
said it was a woman that wanted you

  my aunt exclaimed bowles strik-
ing his leg but brig only spat and
grinned

  sure he said and grinned again

  i have it cried bowles mrs
lee wrote back and told her sister i


the cpotpulfltr magazine

was here-and then my aunt began tele-
graphing that telegram mrs lee had
was from her

  sure thing agreed brig and
bowles looked up to rind him smirking

  youre pretty smart arent you
brig he observed with well-simulated
admiration they dont put one over
on you very often do they 

  no indeedy swaggered brigham
and then they both laughed-to them-
selves but the jest put an effectual end
to the discussion since brigham did not
know what it was he was supposed to
have discovered and bowles took no
pains to enlighten him it was enough
that brig considered him a very gay
dog indeed and he did not deny the
soft impeachment so each with his
satisfied smile they jogged along across
the plains dragging their pack animals
behind them and heading for the
money bug

  all that day they rode on through the
mellow sunshine and the next morning
found them still on their way but just
as the well-remembered ranch came into
view there was a rattle of wheels from
behind and they swung out to give
henry lee the road he was driving
the fiery grays and they fought
gamely against the delay but he pulled
them down to a walk while he handed
bowles a note

  telegram for you mr bowles he
said brig stop at the ranch when
you go by-i want to talk with you
there was much more that might
have been said and mrs lee smiled ap-
provingly at alias bowles but the grays
were within sight of the haystack and
they cut the talk short with a bolt
then bowles glanced through the tele-
gram and thrust it into his shirt

  my aunt- he began and as the

grin on brigs face widened he stopped
short and fell into a sulk no use
telling you anything brig he said at
last you can guess by the color of
my eye

  sure said brig after a moment of
balked silence yore aunt seems to
think a whole lot of you and speak-
in about womenfolks whats this corn-
in down off the hill

  he nodded at the foothills to the
west and as bowles gazed he saw
dixie lee coming down the broad slope
like an arrow she wras riding yva-ha-
lote too and at sight of that noble
charger the heart of alias bowles be-
came sad-or perhaps it was at sight
of dixie lee however that may be
he continued on his way with melan-
choly resignation while brig seemed to
view her coming with alarm

  heres where i ketch hell fer some-
thin he muttered as she sighted him
from afar and when she rode up and
faced him he hung his head like a
truant

  you brig she said at last whip-
ping the hair from her eyes with one
hand you havent got git-up enough
in you to win an indian squaw youll
make a lovely husband for somebody
and thats a fact-the way you do your
courting who do you think is up to
the big house waiting for you 

  huh demanded brig now sud-
denly all attention

  well shes been there for more than
a day-while you were out shooting
prairie dogs what she sees in you is
more than i can say but-

  who are ye talkin about barked
brigham throwing loose his leading
rope

  im talking about your girl an-
swered dixie with spartan directness
here ill lead your pack-go ahead
and showr her your dust

  ill do that said brig leaning for-
ward as she spoke and passing over
the rope he went spurring up the road

  dixie lee gave bowles a level look
from beneath her tumbled hair and
touched wa-ha-lote with the spur her
manner seemed to be a disclaimer of
any responsibility for their being left
together and yet somehow it was very
obvious that the stage had been set for
an interview but if dixie had any in-
tentions she concealed them effectually
and her manner was one of good-
natured tolerance

  well look at that crazy fool ride
she observed as brig disappeared in his
own dust youd think from the way
he travels he was the keenest lover in
alias bowles and the far west



the world she paused here and
laughed to herself

  yes indeed responded bowles
with a certain brotherly pride old brig
thinks a lot of that girl

  well maybe he does conceded
dixie but he certainly makes me pro-
voked i declare the way some of these

men- she paused again and bit

her lip mr bowles was one of those
men too i reckon its all right she
continued resignedly but when a
woman has to ride clear over to the
iila and propose for a man and steal
his girl for him and then round him
up and send him in i guess she has
some excuse to speak her mind dont
you think so mr bowles well then
if your friend brigham had had his way
he would have hit for the summit of the
wrhite mountains and his gjrl would
have been married to a mormon it
makes me mad mr bowles i declare
it does the idea of leaving that poor
little girl over there and never going
near her when all the time she was beg-
ging him to come back and her folks
were reading her letters she couldnt
zvritc it to him-she had to tell him-
and he never showed up at all please
dont apologize for him mr bowles
im sure theres not a word to be said

  mr bowles bowed his head and felt
very humble indeed as if he too in
some inexplicable way had erred and
been rebuked

  and now said dixie at last
fatherll make mr brig his wagon
boss and theyll get married and live
at the ranch simple isnt it

  why it seems so admitted bowles
but how do you know he will

  how do i know repeated dixie
rolling her eyes on him why mr
bowles have you been around the
money bug for two months and failed
to note who was boss right after you
and brigham clark left i went down
and fired that hardy atkins-so you
dont need to be bashful about coming
back

  her voice trailed off a little as she
ended and bowles started and looked
at the ground new worlds and vistas
appeared before him and visions and

sudden dreams-and then he was back
by her side and the road was passing
by

  im sorry he said at last its my
own fault-i should have explained at
the beginning but now your mother
has written to her sister and she has
told my aunt and so ive got to move
on shes telegraphing already he
showed her the yellow message and
slipped it back into his pocket and
there was a deputy sheriff inquiring for
me he added bitterly

  oh dear pouted dixie yanking
at the reluctant pack horse i just
knew shed do it mother means well
but shes a new yorker and-well 
hope shes satisfied

  yes i hope so too added bowles
i never did have anything to be
ashamed of but-do you know who i
am

  no i dont answered dixie may
and i dont care either she added
glancing across at him with clear-seeing
eyes i always knew you were a gen-
tleman and-say whats the matter
with that pack

  she dismounted quickly as she spoke
and bowles dropped off to help then
after the ropes had been tightened they
stood silent within the circle of their
horses

  mr bowles began dixie leaning
one arm on the pack and looking
thoughtfully away being the man you
are you-you wouldnt compel a lady
to apologize to you would you 

  why no no-certainly not gasped
bowles alarmed by a mistiness in her
eyes

  because if thats what youre going

away for-

  oh my dear miss lee protested
bowles now suddenly stirred to the
depths dont think of it-not for a
moment no indeed i will confcss
that i was a little hurt by your-but
thats all right thats all right you
dont know my aunt do you miss lee
i cant explain it to you but-well shes
a very determined woman in her way
and-well she wants me to come
home

  yes


the vovulatr magazine

  yes and so id better move on im
sorry that brig cant go along with me
but-well i can go alone do you re-
member one time when we were com-
ing west i spoke about the spirit of
the country-the spirit of the west
well i have found it-it is to move
on

  and never come back inquired
dixie quickly

  well something like that admitted
bowles

  yes i do remember that re-
sponded dixie with a reminiscent smile
i remember it well we were alone on
the train and we said all kinds of things
-i didnt know you very well then i
remember you told me once if id help
you find the far west youd be my
faithful knight-and all that and i
helped you too didnt i 

  why yes said alias bowles
puzzled by her air

  well what about being my knight
demanded dixie with sudden frank-
ness youve done well out here mr
bowles but theres one thing im disap-
pointed in-you dont keep the customs
of the country

  why what do you mean miss
lee inquired bowles

  a sudden smile illuminated dixies
face-the same smile that had taken
possession of him when he had forgot-
ten and stolen a kiss-and then she
turned away and blushed

  well she said youre the first
money bug man that has gone away
without-without proposing to me 

  she glanced at him defiantly and
folded her arms-and bowles felt his
reason eclipsed and the world go dark
before him a thousand riotous
thoughts clamored suddenly for recog-
nition and his brain reeled at the shock
then he opened his eyes and she was
still smiling at him but the smile had a

twinkle of mischief in it the memory
of her legion of suitors came over him
now and her carefree jesting ways
and he became of a sudden calm they
had all proposed and she had led them
on and then she had told them no
but she should never deal that ignominy
to him if she scorned his humble suit
and desired only to add his scalp to the
rest he would escape at least with his
pride-he would never let her say he
had proposed

  ah you must excuse me miss lee
he said speaking with a formal re-
straint much as i value your happi-
ness i-i cannot observe this--custom
of the counfry

  he spat the words out bitterly and
closed his lips-as if there was more
he might say but dixie did not lose
her smile

  maybe id accept you she sug-
gested with a roguish twinkle and once
more he gazed into her eyes to read
there if she was his friend but a
womans eyes are deceptive and hers
spoke of many things-she smiled the
old dazzling smile but there was mis-
chief in the depths he sighed and
drew away

  ah no he said you cannot un-
derstand then as she waited his
heart turned to bitterness and he spoke
on as the thoughts came really miss
lee it pains me-i cannot believe it
what is one man more or less that you
should hurt me like this dixie-he
raised his downcast eyes and regarded
her reproachfully-i have dreamed
about you i have worshiped you from
afari have fought my way to be near
you you dont know how it would
pain me-after all i have hoped-to
have you-

  aw bowles chided dixie reach-
ing out her hand cant you see that i
want you 

  and then bowles dream came true

the law of the machine

  by robert j pearsall

  aiithor of comrades in hateetc

 the strange case of a young navalman who unwittingly pur-
 sued a court martial half way around the world a tale of naval
 discipline which regards a man but a cog in a great machine

most men wearing bluejackets
uniform will tell you the es-
sentials of the case against
andrew hemphill sometimes
their accounts may be a bit garbled es -
pecially if you have been indiscreet in
offering overmuch liquid persuasion
but in main the facts remain the same

  hemphill enlisted in st louis early
in the year  originally he had
come from a country town the spirit
of adventure had driven him to the city
and thcnce into the service and the
same red-blooded virtue or vice which
ever you please drove him out of it

  for he found that the life of an ap-
prentice seaman so far from being ad-
venturous was really very tame and
very monotonous scrubbing down
decks although undoubtedly essential
to the well-being of a ship and of a
ships crew was not exactly a romantic
occupation and between peeling po-
tatoes in the galley and hoeing potatoes
in his fathers garden he infinitely pre-
ferred the latter or would have pre-
ferred it had circumstances given him a
choice the setting-up exercises and
manual of arms grew tiresome too and
double-timing around the ships deck
although certainly a healthful exercise
had very little of the element of ex-
citement so when he got his first pay
day some six weeks after he had en-
listed he went ashore determined to
forget for twenty-four hours at least
that such a thing as the united states
navy existed

  andrew hit the beach with a crowd
most of them old-timers most of

them too had the same object in view
as himself and of course to men that
desire forgetfulness there is but one
goal the drinking places of brooklyn
swallowed them up and disgorged them
next day repentant and headachy and
glad to get back to their hammocks and
sea mattresses

  that is all but andrew it was a
good many days later and a good many
thousand miles away that he rejoined
his ship

  he got into a poker game early in the
evening and with the combined luck of
a beginner and a drunk made a win-
ning what happened after that was
mightily confused he woke in a hotel
in chicago just how and why he had
come there he never knew it didnt
matter much he was there and well-
nigh broke and the flaring headlines of
the first newspaper he saw informed
him that the fleet of which his ship was
a part had sailed that morning on the
first leg of the long-heralded trip
around the world

  now andrew didnt like the service
overmuch but in his sober senses he
had no intention of deserting his fa-
ther was a civil war veteran and re-
garded deserters and traitors as in the
same category and there was his own
reputation to consider he must go
back but how 

  he might have surrendered to the
chicago recruiting depot but to do
that would put the government to the
expense of transporting him to a new
station and would consequently in-
crease his punishment or so he argued


the popular magazine

no the proper thing to do was to re-
join his ship and the first home port
at which the fleet would touch was san
francisco he must work his way
west to the coast

  he started on his journey with one
dollar and twenty cents in his pocket
twice on the way across he was ar-
rested and confined for vagrancy
when he finally reached san francisco
the fleet had already arrived been en-
tertained and left for the philippines
via australia

  hemphill at that time had something
of the quality of a bulldog he had
started out to join his ship and he
would do it the transport logan was
on the point of sailing to the islands
with a human cargo of marines from
mare island and soldiers from the pre-
sidio andrew insinuated himself into
the good graces of the former and also
during the process of embarkation into
their ranks when the transport sailed
he went along with it after they had
passed the golden gate he confessed
his presence but not his purpose and
was permitted to work his way across
the plan had the sole demerit of being
too expeditious for when he reached
manila the fleet was still hobnobbing
with its newly made friends in aus-
tralia

  now a ten-thousand-mile journey
under such circumstances as these is to
say the least somewhat exhausting
and the philippine islands isnt the
easiest place in the world for a stray
white man to make a living so inside
of a week after his arrival he was
picked up by the secret-service men as
a suspicious character being without
visible means of support seeing no
other way out of it he told them his
story whereupon they turned him over
to the naval authorities he spent the
next ten days in the naval prison at
cavite and at the end of that time the
fleet having arrived was taken to his
ship and delivered to his captain

  in the military service black is con-
sidered black and desertion desertion
and theres an end of it andrew found
that he had unwittingly pursued a gen-
eral court-martial halfway around the

world still until the actual trial lie
did not worry much the fact that he
had pursued it would he believed ex-
tenuate him he looked for a light sen-
tence perhaps for an acquittal

  but the ranking officer of the court-
martial was a man who believed in the
strict enforcement of the regulations
and the others perforce agreed with
him they gave andrew three years at
hard labor then the court adjourned
to tiffin and andrew was led back to
the brig later he was transferred
from the brig to cavite and from ca-
vite to a transport and finally he landed
at mare island was hurried through
the gates of the naval prison spread-
eagled and searched clothed in a felons
uniform assigned to a cell and forgot-
ten

  but andrew himself did not forget

il

  three years later andrew hemphill
stood waiting for his release his right
hand on the outer bar of his cell door
as the iron clutch that secured the door
slid slowly back he braced himself as
he had done a thousand times before
for a quick spring into the corridor
his name shouted harshly by the ma-
rine sergeant in charge rang through
the prison he flung the door open
leaped outside closed it again and
trotted slowly in regulation double
time which was the only kind of move-
ment permitted in the prison toward
the entrance stopping before the ser-
geants desk

  the sergeant pointed at a small heap
of clothes that lay on the stone floor
the cast-off uniform of a seaman

  get into them he said brusquely
and remember this-dont hang
around vallejo you cant do no good
there get the first boat out come
shake a leg now we aint got all
morning to waste on you

  andrew himself had no desire to loi-
ter in a few moments the change was
made he took the yellow paper his
dishonorable discharge from the navy
from the hand of the sergeant and
thrust it into his pocket without glanc-
the law of the machine



ing at it the money twenty dollars
in all he paid little more attention to
although it was the first he had handled
in years he signed a paper without
reading it stepped to the door it opened
before him and he passed out still on
the double time outside he halted a
corporal fell in behind him the com-
mand forward march  was given
and he passed through the arcade and
down the stone walk that led to the
navy-yard gate

  five minutes later he had boarded
the ferry that led to vallejo the cor-
poral remained behind four bells
went the whistle sounded the chains
that supported the gangplank rattled
the ferry cast off her moorings and
moved out into the stream andrew
hemphill sitting on the upper deck
watched clear space open between him-
self and the navy yard and knew that
he was free

  that is free in a sense in a sense
too the shackles of the prison were still
on him his head still drooped for-
ward- so that he would have to glance
upward when he wished to meet an-
other persons eyes which truth to
tell was not likely to occur often his
voice had degenerated into a whine
his body was soft and flaccid his mind
also he was a wreck and he knew it

  nevertheless he exulted it would
not take a strong man to do what he
had planned really it was a job for
just such a man as he one who know-
ing himself ruined can see no further
hazard when a man has lost all and
knows it he has nothing left to fear

  late that night he boarded the navy-
yard launch and came back to mare
island

  he had discarded his uniform and
was dressed now in a cheap civilian
suit so he won his way in without rec-
ognition he walked boldly past the
guardhouse and up the walk toward
the commandants house just before
reaching it however he turned aside
into lincoln park there he concealed
himself behind a convenient shrub and
waited

  just in front of the commandants
house stood a sentry box in that box

night and day a marine orderly was
stationed partly to protect the house
mainly to run errands for the com-
mandant it was andrews problem to
get past that orderly into the house
and owing to the fact that he had spent
the last two months in the same cell
with a man who had himself recently
been orderly to the commandant he had
a pretty definite idea of how to accom-
plish it

  he waited patiently until twelve
oclock at that hour the orderlies
changed watches he watched the man
relieved walk briskly back toward the
barracks while the other settled himself
for his four-hour watch

  half an hour later andrew saw the
light of a match flare up for an instant
inside the sentry box that meant that
the man was indulging in a forbidden
smoke it also meant that for at least
ten minutes he would stay inside the
sentry box with his face turned toward
the guardhouse watching for the pos-
sible approach of the officer of the day
and consequently that any one passing
the box in the rear would be safe from
observation

  andrew sprang quickly up and still
keeping to the park made a wide de-
tour so that he came out on the street
about a hundred yards from the front
gate of the commandant as noiseless-
ly as possible but with no other at-
tempt at concealment he moved briskly
up the walk turned in through the open
gate and climbed the steps of the house

  the door was as he had expected
unlocked he turned the knob and
pushed it open with a single swift
noiseless movement then he closed it
behind him and stood for a moment in
the darkness listening

  presently he felt his way forward for
a few steps until he came to the foot
of the winding stairs these he climbed
the soft carpet muffling his footsteps
reaching the top he turned down the
hall and paused before a door the door
which he had been told opened into the
sleeping room of the commandant he
listened intently and was rewarded by
hearing the sound of heavy regular
breathing he trembled a little but it


the populatr magazine

was with exultation he had been right
in his calculations his enemy lay just
beyond that door sleeping and helpless

  he withdrew a revolver from his
pocket and holding it in his right hand
opened the door with his left but his
caution was unnecessary the room was
dark and the deep breathing of the
sleeper continued after a momentary
pause he felt along the wall until his
lingers encountered a button he
pressed upon it and the room sprang
into light

  in the farther corner of the room
stood a bed upon it lay the form of
the commandant

  for a moment he slept on while an-
drew gloated over his helplessness
then the unaccustomed light aroused
him his eyes opened blinking uncer-
tainly andrew made a little movement
toward him pistol half raised the
commandant saw him and sat suddenly
upright his pajama-clad figure sliding
to the edge of the bed then he stopped
with a trapped frightened look in his
eyes for andrews pistol was trained
full upon him

  wha-what do you want  he quav-
ered

  at that moment stripped as he was
of his gold-braided authority shivering
under the threat and fear of death like
any other mortal there was something
so intensely human about the admiral
that for a moment andrew almost re-
pented his design then he remem-
bered his wrongs and strengthened his
resolution

  stay where you are he said warn-
ingly then i have come to kill you
admiral

  in spite of himself and hating him-
self for it he spoke respectfully even
servilely with the servility of years of
enforced habit the admiral caught
the note and knew with whom he had
to deal he stiffened himself and his
voice took on a tone of arrogance al-
though he still trembled

  you are an enlisted man or an ex-
enlisted man he said are you mad
put down that gun

  i am an ex-enlisted man said an-
drew i was discharged from the

naval prison to-day dont you remem-
ber me

  i do not said the admiral and in
a moment he had regained his old hate-
ful air of contemptuous superiority
but i do know this-that you will be
back in the naval prison to-morrow

you must--

  but you interrupted andrew
you will be in your coffin

  his extended hand became rigid his
forefinger squeezing the trigger but
the admiral broke in with a sneer

  you are a brave man he said if
i have wronged you in the past you
are taking a noble revenge to shoot
me down in cold blood without giving
me a chance

  andrews hand wavered sank to his
side a chance he cried what
chance am i giving myself the shot
will arouse the servants and the sen-
tries i have no way of getting off the
island i have laid no plans of escape
i dont intend to try to escape this
means death to me i know it and you
know it im no coward besides
what chance did you give me

  you retorted the admiral quickly
enough to arrest andrews rising hand
what have i to do with you  i do
not even know you

  i suppose not said andrew after
a little pause id forgotten that i
was nothing to you of course you
lifted your hand and crushed me as you

might have crushed a fly-

 crushed you how did i crush
you  who are you 

  it doesnt matter there have been
many flies i might be any one of them
but-well yes ill tell you im an-
drew hemphill

 i dont remember-

  not even yet ill remind you
then do you remember the apprentice
seaman over whom you sat in judg-
ment on board the u s s - in

manila harbor the man who missing
his ship in new york had beaten his
way to the other side of the earth to
join it i see you do do you remem-
ber the fine speech you made urging
the usual punishment arguing that to
let him off would injure the service
the law of the machine



would destroy discipline  do you re-
member how knowing your influence
over the other members of the court
you deliberately set yourself against
himand condemned him to three years
of living death well that man was
myself now do you understand 

  the admiral shifted himself to a
more comfortable position well hard-
ly he said easily in the manner of one
who invites an argument i merely
insisted that the court do its duty
surely you cant blame me for that

  blame you cried andrew good
heavens  blame you  the memories
of long solitary days and sleepless
nights of back-breaking heart-breaking
drudgery of torturing loneliness of
abject humiliation of unprovoked abuse
and curses and even senseless blows
struck in secret by brutal guards came
to him and he almost laughed blame
you for that i could tear your heart
out

  but why asked the admiral you
were nothing to me personally you
were condemned by the regulations not
by me do you suppose i make my
own rules  i carried out my orders did
my duty thats all he was speaking
as coolly now as though he were sitting
in his office with all the instruments of
his authority around him

  your duty was it your duty to
destroy me for thats what you have
done

 i you what am i what are
you hemphill you and i simply
didnt exist in the sense you mean i
wronged you you say i reply-and
this isnt a plea for mercy-that you
personally meant nothing to me i
never gave you a thought how could
i you were only one in a thousand
you-

  thats it cried andrew thats
one of the things fve been thinking
about there are thousands of others
lying in that prison to-night and in
other prisons there are thousands of
men that are just as innocent of any
moral wrong as i was desertion inso-
lence fighting neglect of duty drunk-
enness those are the kind of offenses
men are confined f-or in the service of-

fenses that would hardly be considered
misdemeanors in civil life

  and then outside the prisons there
are a hundred thousand more that are
caught in the military trap and are be-
ing ruined too only a little less swiftly
huddled together in crowded barrack
rooms and worse-crowded ships cut off
from intercourse with their fellows de-
prived of all liberty of action forced to
wake and sleep and eat and drink and
walk and talk by rote and rule per-
forming no useful work learning no
useful lesson they are slowly rotting
away body and mind and soul you
know this is true you are not respon-
sible for it you say  well say you are
right its the system then thats to
blame i thank god that im able to
strike a blow at it through you who
stand-

  you strike a blow at it hemphill
that system has been running on for
good or evil for ten thousand years it
is the oldest of institutions and you
think that by killing me you will change
it

  it will help but there was a note
of doubt in andrews voice

  it cant im of no importance per-
sonally shoot me if you like after-
ward i would advise you to shoot your-
self but it will make no difference i
am merely a driving shaft as you were
a cog in the wheel a part of the ma-
chine thats all 

  andrew was trembling now the
admiral went on

  individually no man in the service
is important but collectively we are
the force that has made and that still
makes civilized society possible in the
final analysis we are the keeper of or-
der and the enforcer of laws and the
safeguard of civilization without us
the wisest rules of society would be but
jests for the lips of fools when we
think of this does it matter that all of
us are bent and molded and distorted-
as we are-and some of us even
crushed in order that we may fill our
particular place perform our particu-
lar function 

  you violated the law of the ma-
chine you were punished and cast


the popular magazine

out from your individual standpoint
you were punished too severely from
the same standpoint practically all mili-
tary prisoners are punished too severe 
ly and practically all enlisted men ar
wronged in one way or another we
all admit that but we are bound by
our oaths not to think of you as indi-
viduals or of ourselves as individuals
but of the service as a unit and it is
all for the good of the service

  the service is like no other man-
made institution it is founded in au-
thority absolute unquestioned unwav-
ering authority and in the exercise of
this authority there must be no quib-
bling no hesitancy you were a de-
serter in fact if not in intention i in-
sisted that you be tried and sentenced
as a deserter if i had done otherwise
if you had gone unpunished others
would have used your case as a prece-
dent and an excuse it was the only
way

  he paused a moment a close ob-
server would have said that he was lis-
tening but andrew standing with un-
steady eyes downcast gave no heed

  but vou resumed the admiral
saw nothing of this you brooded in
your cell over your wrongs night after
night for years you persuaded your-
self that i was responsible and you
plannedrevenge and you came here
to-night your first night of freedom to
kill me you fool

  the admiral leaned forward and
raised his hand in a gesture of author-
ity habitual to him it was as if he
were again the judge and andrew the
prisoner

  you fool he repeated you had
your chance your chance of freedom
and a happy life and you threw it
away you whined to yourself that
you were ruined-ruined in your early
twenties why hemphill men have
served ten times your prison term and
come out middle-aged and still lived
on and played the game and won it
but they were brave men you are a
coward the lowest kind of a coward
you are afraid to live and you are
afraid to admit your fear even to your-

self and so you come here intending
to kill me knowing that the penalty will
be death avowedly for the purpose of
obtaining revenge but really with the
object of shuffling off your worthless
life in a blaze of mock heroics

  andrew stood still with bowed
shamed head and dulled eyes he
hardly seemed to hear the admirals last
words maybe im wrong he said
slowly as if speaking to himself
maybe its all necessary but it is a
great price-

  well why dont you shoot asked
the admiral with a sneer

  andrews head suddenly came up
and his eyes for one tense moment met
the admirals and do you think i
might make good yet he cried be-
seechingly do you think i still have a
chance 

   had is the proper word said the
admiral you are still amenable to
military discipline you know yrour
discharge doesnt take effect until
twenty-four hours after its issued you
know and-listen

  some one was running rapidly up the
stairs andrew whirled toward the
sound caught himself choked down a
cry and stood waiting the admiral
smiled

  it is the sergeant of the guard said
he i rang for him perhaps you
didnt notice this button on the side of
the bed but you still have time to
kill me

  andrew said nothing and made no
move

  put away that gun said the ad-
miral sharply

  andrew hesitated for one bewildered
instant and then shoved the revolver in
his hip pocket at the same moment
the sergeant of the guard rushed into
the room

  he glanced at andrew in surprised
suspicion and then saluted the pajama-
clad figure on the bed

  you rang for me sir he said

  yes give this-gentleman safe
conduct off the island then to an-
drew in an undertone play the game
good-by
finger prints

by charles r barnes
author of  the self-starter   the sweeny stories  etc

   everybody knows that finger prints dont lie but it looked as if they
   did when the police tried to fasten an automobile robbery on an
   ingenious crook whose finger prints were on record at headquarters

cross the street from the
howell garage two men stood
near the curb engaged in ear-
nest converse both were
young their ages ranging between
twenty-two and twenty-six the one
who was doing most of the talking had
a face full of the lines which told of
world wisdom it was a thin keen
face and the eyes small and deep-set
wrere eloquent with cunning the
young fellow was under medium height
and spare of body but his quick vehe-
ment gestures bespoke a wirelike mus-
cular equipment

  his companion was of a decidedly
different type being several inches
taller and many pounds heavier and
having features wthich in their coarse-
ness suggested animalism this man
had little to say he listened and as
the conversation progressed his face
gradually lost an expression of density
and became alive with interest every
fewr minutes he followed the thin-fea-
tured mans furtive glance as it swept
across the street and took in the al-
ready very familiar situation

  the howell residence was a typical
new york corner house all windows
near the ground were protected with
iron bars the street doors were
equipped with gratings the place pre-
sented a stony inhospitable exterior
the drawn blinds giving no hint at the
cheer that might abide within

  in the rear of it facing the side

street was a garage which once had
been a stable a high brick wall ran
from it to the house there was of
course a motor-car entrance to the
garage from the street also there was
a smaller door of ordinary size to the
right of the larger one

  the thin-faced man jerked a thumb
toward this door and talked on eagerly
but patiently with the air of one who
tells a story over and over again that
no part of it be missed

  you see eddie as i was saying i
made up my mind a long time ago that
there wasnt any big money in driving
cars for folks you know yourself
that im right youve driven long
enough to know it

  the other slowly nodded assent
well then proceeded the speaker
i figured and figured like i told you
i did pete riley i says to myself
if youre ever going to know what it
feels like to hit the high spots of life
youve got to get in some line that
makes a bank roll swell faster than
being a chauffeur does thats the way
i talked to myself eddie and then
all at once it came to me that automo-
biles are worth a few thousand dollars
apiece-or a few hundred according to
the car-and it looked to me as if they
were standing round just sort of whim-
pering to be taken away you under-
stand-taken away and sold

  again the other man nodded

  he of the thin face fastened his eyes

the popular magazine

on the coarse features opposite him
noted the growing interest and avarice
there and went on 

  ive gone over that part about how
i inquired till i found out who was
buying- the stolen machines the boys
in the lifting business here run em over
to philadelphia and thats the last any-
body ever sees of em i got that part
of it learned all right then i went into
action it was easy for a while eddie
and i made money then they caught
me--or thought they did thats how
my finger prints happen to be on file at
police headquarters and eddie those
finger prints are going to make you and
me a barrel of money as soon as i
got the idea i made a list of every
driver i knew and finally after id
studied it a whole lot i says to myself
pete i says eddie cooke is the lad
for you hes a square guy i told
myself and hes a fine driver and a
good mechanic hes the party youre
looking for

  thats the way i figured it out ed-
die and im glad to see that i wasnt
mistaken in the way i felt i knew you
were wise enough to go in with me
and help me clean up there isnt a
chance of you getting blamed im the
guy to take all that now lets take a
walk till six oclock-its half past five
anyway this minute-and then well
come back here and ill show you how
everythings going to work out we
can slip in the garage while tony the
dago driver is getting his supper and
youll get a look at the inside workings
come on

  he slipped a hand to cookes arm
and the two were soon hurrying west-
ward from the spot riley still talking
volubly he stepped along with a
quick snappy tap of feet against the
sidewalk his body erect and full of
nervous energy the other man-
cooke-clumped heavily beside him
a solid hulking specimen of humanity

  now that the howell place was be-
hind him cooke no longer could vis-
ualize it together with the costly motor
cars in the garage the light went out
of his countenance he was of that
mental caliber which can appreciate a

five-dollar note tightly clutched in hand
but cannot bring the picture of one out
of mere words

  for a half hour the two wralked the
streets bringing up at six oclock near
the howell garage

  ive been watching this place for
nearly a week explained rile- and
i know every little thing about it
thats the way to handle a deal of this
sort-what 

  i guess youre right assented
cooke we ought to know what were
doing

  thats wise talk complimented
riley youve got the idea all right
now listen-at six oclock tony the
driver whos working for howell
switches out the lights downstairs in
the garage and goes to his room up-
stairs he stays there about five min-
utes combing his hair and getting ready
for his supper they feed him that in
the servants dining room its on the
basement floor you can count on him
being there for about half an hour-
some nights when the blinds arent
closed real tight you can get a squint
at him forcing solid food into himself
and looking satisfied there eddie-
look hes put out the lights down-
stairs in a minute hell be up in his
room see theres his light now
cooke gazed at the illuminated upper
story of the garage then he turned
to riley

  gee  he exclaimed i guess you
havent got the number of that place
nor nothin

  the thin-faced man laughed in a sat-
isfied manner

  its part of the job he said i
take all these precautions so i wont get
caught there are two cars in that
shed worth getting hold of eddie as
i was telling you one is the limousine
theyre using since old man howell
went south i got wise to his trip in
the newspapers that car is worth
eight thousand if its worth a cent
the other is young howells hundred-
and-twenty-horse-power racer it has a
roadster body on it now the old man
used it to go downtown in-he used it
every day we might get it but we
finger prints



dont want it what we want is that
limousine gee its some car eddie-
some car

  riley suddenly ceased speaking and
caught cooke by the arm the light in
the upper story of the garage had gone
out

  well give tony ten minutes to get
interested in his ham-and or whatever
the chefs going to hand him riley
went on then well go across the
street and start a thing or two that
little door isnt locked while tony is
round he locks it when he leaves on
a trip but he never thinks its worth
while to do it just during supper time
so theres where we get in eddie

  young mr cooke regarded his com-
panion with rapt admiration

  some system you got kid he en-
thusiastically commented you must
a been on fixed post here for a
month

  riley grinned all successful busi-
nesses run on a system he said my
business is only an idea with a system
to back it but you can make up your
mind that the system is all right you
got me when i explained it before
about the finger prints

  yes you see they took mine at
headquarters when they tried to hang
the tilbury car theft on me they al-
most got me theyd have done it if
their evidence had been stronger im
loose now because it wasnt air-tight
but a man doesnt like the idea of his
finger prints being on file with the po-
lice rileys crafty eyes seemed to
sink farther back into his head as the
lids drooped quickly over them i
want to make those finger prints a
joke he vehemently finished

  howre you goin to do it

  youll see in about three minutes
came the confident reply i guess we
better be getting across the street
dont be scared eddie tony likes his
eats too much to quit in a hurry hell
stay on that job till the last wheat cake
is a ruin come on

  both men made a rapid crossing
riley walked along the side of the
house until he came to a basement win-
dow around the edges of which shone

a narrow ribbon of light he beckoned
to cooke who silently came up

  there explained riley pointing
you can just see tonys back through
that crack see him sick himself for-
ward at his supper and then teeter
backward with a face full cant you
just picture him making a wreck of a
beautiful appetite i can

  i can see somethin movin admit-
ted cooke

  thats tony riley assured him
now hurry along well do a little
planting for to-morrow night with
me

  sure

  riley led the way to the little garage
door turned the knob and entered the
place cooke followed cautiously
when they were inside riley carefully
closed the door and produced a pocket
electric flash light this he turned for
an instant over the interior of the ga-
rage a big costly limousine car was
shown on the floor facing the auto-
mobile entrance it appeared ready for
instant use

  thats the car we want eddie
whispered riley remember where it
is so you can get to it without using a
light all you got to do is to get in
set the self-starter going and run her
out as soon as your gasoline power
takes hold be quiet and slick about it
and you can be halfway to philadelphia
before tony finds out that hes missing
something now come over here he
grasped a sleeve of his partners coat
and led the way guided by occasional
winks of the flash light to where a low
racy-lined motor car stood i get my
fine work in right here and now he
remarked the lamp went back into
his pocket and he approached closer
to the racer during the next minute
he moved busily about evidently hard
at work but making scarcely any
noise

  what you doin  hoarsely ques-
tioned cooke

  sh-h-h-h-h whispered the worker
wait till we get out

  for perhaps a half minute longer he
lingered then the flash light winked
again showing the way to the door


the cpopular magazine

both men passed hastily over the inter-
vening space and soon were out of the
garage and leisurely walking away

 what did you do in there asked

cooke

  just what i told you i meant to do
was the reply i left my finger prints
all over young howells racing car
theres nothing like a hard polished
surface for leaving finger prints on
try it yourself some time eddie on
glass

  but i dont quite get you the other
said i guess you talked too fast for
me when you was handing me the dope
before how is this thing going to
work out

  oh gosh breathed the thin-faced
man under his breath then he went
slowly and carefully into an elaboration
of his former explanation

  the racing car is all washed and
polished ready to use he said no
one uses it but the old man and hes
at palm beach with mr frick and the
rest of the nobility so the car wont
be used to-morrow get that

  yes

  all right the family will ride in
the limousine the racing car stays
where it is ive left my finger marks
all over it eddie ive made some of
em a sort of slide as if i had been
trying to move the car into position
for running it out theres sure to be
just a slight coating of dust on the pol-
ish-enough to make those finger marks
show up plain to the detective whos
sent out on the job hell get the fin-
ger-print expert to come out and photo-
graph those marks ill be arrested be-
cause the prints will be the same as
the ones they have on file down at head-
quarters-the ones they have of me
see 

  it seems plain enough admitted
eddie

  the police continued riley will
work it out that i went into the garage
to steal the racer i tried to work it
into position to get it out but got scared
at something then rather than go
away without anything i took the lim-
ousine the racers a more expensive
piece of machinery so that explanation

stacks up well say my boy ill make
such a joke out of that whole finger-
print business that the system wont
have any value

  cookes face spread in a slow grin
i see he said say thats some
idea that is 

  sure it is agreed riley modestly
and the beauty of the whole scheme
is that no one will be caught youll
go into that garage to-morrow night
while tony is at supper run the car
out and be clear away from the new
york police before the alarm can be
spread through the precincts mean-
time im spending my time up in har-
lem playing pool with some friends
thats what you call an alibi meaning
that you couldnt have done what you
did then next day ill saunter down
to the white front garage where im
known to hang out a detective will
get me before ive loafed there fifteen
minutes hell take me down to the
finger-print man who will show me
that im guilty of stealing old man
howells swell limousine ha ha
young cookes dull eyes were wide
with wondering approval

  theres class to you pete he de-
clared theres class to you

  ill give the police the laugh pete
resumed ill have twenty men able
to swear that i was playing pool when
that car was stolen and i guess that
wont make the finger-print system look
more useless than a blown-out casing
ill show it up as unreliable then it
wont make so much difference if my
prints are on file the only answer
will be that some other party has finger
tips just like mine and they say that
cant happen say eddie just watch
the papers and see me make those po-
lice look like the original prize package
of boobs 

ii

  two of the best and most brutal of
the third-degree experts in the new
york police department were question-
ing pete riley it was well along to-
ward evening of the day after the even-
ing during which the howell limousine
had been reported stolen riley had
finger prints



been picked up at the white front
garage according to his plan the
finger-print authority at headquarters
had fallen into the trap set for him
krug and fay the third-degree men
were working over riley for the sec-
ond time that day

  we just telephoned to that pool-
room party in harlem lied krug and
he says you wasnt there when you said
you was youd better come across
with a right statement riley and save
yourself trouble

  i wish i could accommodate you
smiled riley but its the truth that
i didnt steal that machine i was just
where i said i was at the time you say
it was missed youre kidding about
mac saying i wasnt in his pool room
i was there all right-and moren that
i paid him a two-case note i borrowed
of him last week remind him of it
and he wont forget folks dont for-
get it when money they have let go
of is paid back it doesnt happen
often he continued to smile the
detectives regarded him sternly

  what did you do with the ma-
chine questioned fay we know
you stole it

  i dont know anything about it
riley insisted you tell me that some
finger prints were found that are the
same as mine i cant help that i
was up in harlem playing pool when
you claim the machine was stolen and
i can prove it thats all i got to say
he relapsed into silence his face bear-
ing an injured expression the detec-
tives shot a few more questions at him
then left

  well be back they informed him
and when we leave here again well
have your confession think that over
kid well have it because we know
you stole that car them finger prints
never lied yet and we dont believe
theyre goin to begin for a cheap ama-
teur crook like you they stalked sol-
emnly away and brought up much
troubled in mind before the finger-
print expert

  we dont like to knock your game
began krug but its lost out this
time

  thats the truth affirmed fay

  wre telephoned to that pool-room
guy in harlem continued krug and
he says the young party was up there
plaring pool from five oclock to eight-
thirty he says the game the feller
was in got so loaded down with money
that nobody would quit to get supper

  they sent out for sandwiches ex-
plained fay and that guy we got
locked up wins near forty dollars he
must be a shark i guess

  the finger-print expert looked puz-
zled

  nevertheless he announced the
man we caught is the thief finger
prints dont lie and those we found
on the racing-car body were as distinct
as any i ever saw

  well said krug you may be tell-
ing the truth when you say that the
prints dont lie but i guess to-day is
an off day for them that young feller
has as clean an alibi as youd want
we-

  we didnt stop at the pool-room
party interposed fay we got a
harlem man to question a lot of the
lads that was hangin out in that pool
room they knew riley and all of
em say he was there from five to eight-
thirty mixed up in a game that was
some game accordin to the way them
kids looks at a game the car was
stole as you remember between six
and six-forty-five the driver says it
was there when he went to supper and
was gone when he went back to the
garage

  and that krug reminded the fin-
ger-print expert lets riley out ive
saw framed alibis but this aint one
of em riley never stole that car be-
cause he was somewhere else when it
was stole and what are you goin to
do about it detective krug leaned
confidently on reason and confronted
the expert with a smug grin

  youre sure riley was in harlem
came like a protest from the man who
applied science to the catching of crini
inals

  the harlem cop is called a good
one fay said his name is rafferty
and hes said to be real thorough


the vovulacr magazine

  for a moment the genius of the fin-
ger prints considered then he asked
what is the next move

  theres just one fay told him
and mr riley makes that he moves
out of here

  but-but stammered the scientific
individual hes guilty the prints
dont lie

  they did this time krug insisted
riley aint guilty hes got a couple
dozen men to swear he aint and what
you got you got a wigglv picture of
some thumb ends that wont convince
a jury against the word of a couple
dozen real citizens that seen riley play-
in pool while that machine was bein
stole we aint knockin yourf game
mister though we never did think it
was as good as the old methods but
we got to tell you that theres nothin
to do now but turn that lad loose-
unless we can beat him up sos hell
make a fake confession come along
fay lets make a try they turned
and were leaving when an officer with
a message entered

  you neednt bother any more about
hangin that auto business on riley with
the finger prints he told the expert
why came the quick question
because he didnt take the car was
the reply detectives krug and fay
cast joyous though somewhat pitying
glances at the expert whose face im-
mediately became an illustration of the
word gloom

 we told you so-began the

sleuths

  but- expostulated the much

harassed finger-tip man

  the officer with the message calmly
went on

  a party by the name of eddie

cooke stole that car he explained
he was out joy ridin with a couple of
jersey city girls this afternoon and
bing everything goes over an embank-
ment and the cooke lad is cruel hurt
hes in the hospital and he confessed
to stealin the car after a doctor had
told him he was goin to die he wont
be out for a couple of weeks lies so
bad hurt

  but riley- stammered the ex-
pert hes guilty

  youre speakin the truth said the
officer the jersey police got the doc
to tell cooke he was dyin just as soon
as they found out that the car was -
stolen then the lad was told he was
under arrest he gets mad and accuses
riley of double crossin him riley put
him up to stealin the car and said no-
body could get caught this young
cooke says riley made them finger
marks on the racin car the night be-
fore to draw attention to him then
he fixed up a alibi cooke thinks riley
will get off after standin for a pinch
with a sure-thing alibi behind him for
a chance at splittin fifty-fifty with
cooke on the sale of the car cooke
figgered he was made a goat of and
squealed he was so sure he couldnt
get caught on account of riley tellin
him so that he stopped to take some
lady frens joy ridin last night and
liked it so well he called round for em
to-day thats all there is to it i
guess you got riley right with them fin-
ger prints i guess you have 

  the experts face grew thoughtful
as he watched the man depart krug
and fay stared sheepishly at each other
then the finger-print mans features
became wreathed in a happy smile

  they never lie he dreamily mur-
mured they never lie

plain and painful talk

touring a senatorial investigation in the last session of congress senator
clapp experienced great difficulty in getting some information from a nerv-
ous witness

    now said the senator somewhat sharply out with it my man out
with it

    if the committee will excuse me said the lawyer representing the witness
i do not like the term out with it this is not the office of a dentist


rom time to time vc receive letters
from those who think they have a
grievance we are taken to task because
a character in one story talks like an
anarchist and tries to promote class
hatred another complains because an-
other character in another story smokes
too many cigarettes or speaks disparag-
ingly of the italian race one under-
taker wrote to us being in a very bitter
frame of mind because a personage in
one of our stories referred contemptu-
ously to a member of his honorable
craft

a a

 k cant answer anonymous letters

      but we do answer every one who
signs his name to his letter and is good
enough to give his address the an-
swer must be much the same in all such
cases we are not responsible for what
the characters depicted in the stories in
till- popilar say or do the greatest
and indeed the only qualification neces-
sary to make a good character in action
is that he or she must act and think and
talk like a human being and if you
reflect for a few moments you will real-
ize that  human being of your ac-
quaintance is infallible nor does wisdom
continually flow from the lips of any
one we all are certain to talk a good
deal of nonsense sooner or later we
are all likely to make statements that
cannot be verified to voice opinions that
afterward seem ridiculous to give ex-
pression to prejudices altogether un-
worthy of us probably most people in
the world talk a little too much and we
hope that the imaginary folk you find be-
tween the covers of the magazine act like

the people you and in the world out-
side if they are true to life that is the
most you can ask from them from the
authors who write the stories or from
us we are not responsible for their
politics their religion their tastes or
habits any more than we are responsible
for the personal appearance of the man
next door

a a

tixk for a moment and you will
recollect that there are villains who
give bad counsel in the pages of the
iible was shakespeare a poor drama-
tist because i ago recommended the use
of strong drink when we all know that
it is a very bad thing are you inclined
to censure dickens because uriah hecp
is a hypocrite and a rascal and squeers
the master of dothebovs hall gives ex-
pression to the most improper and in-
human views as to the best method of
bringing up young children a story
ought to express life itself in some fash-
ion and you must know that life is a
somewhat confused and disorganized af-
fair for most of us if everybody
agreed with everybody else in a story
there wouldnt be much of a story to
tell so remember that while we are
responsible and willing to stand behind
everything we ourselves say editorially
we are not responsible for the opinions
of the characters just remember that
they are human and liable to error also
remember that the only thing that makes
a story had from a moral point of view
is untruth to the facts of life and in-
sincerity on the part of the author even
if the villain is not punished or the hero
is not rewarded a story may neverthe-
   a chat with you continued

less carry the message of high idealism
and moral uplift

vou will be glad to hear we hope
that the complete novel opening the
next issue of the magazine is by ber-
trand w sinclair author of north of
 this new story is not a sequel to
it it is just as good a story in its own
way it is called the laying of the
ghost and is the account of a man who
had urgent need for fifty thousand dol-
lars and who was suspected of holding
up a train to get the money it is a
western story and a mystery story as
well the combination of the breezy
outdoor atmosphere with the qualities
of suspense and bafflement is a good one
you knew long ago that sinclair under-
stood how to paint real human and lov-
able men you have begun to learn re-
cently that his women are perhaps even
more engaging than his men certainly
they have more than their share of
feminine charm we think you will find
the heroine in the laying of the
ghost one of the most alluring and at-
tractive girls you have met in a long
time and in passing we want to an-
nounce to you the fact that sinclair is
now at work on a sequel to north of
 and that you will have it soon

a a

in the next issue of the popular also
are several short stories worthy of
special mention and contrasting strongly
in style and atmosphere there is sauce
for the gander by henry c rowland
you have read many of his longer sto-
ries but this is the first of his shorter
tales we have ever printed it is a
comedy of new york life the story of
an elderly man who for a definite pur-
pose of his own starts out to play the
part of a rake he has been most re-
spectable a pillar of society the very

epitome of solid worth and wisdom
suddenly he changes he associates with
chorus girls he indulges in wine suppers
and late hours the effect on his daugh-
ter who has a will of her own is alarm-
ing it is a charming jolly sort of
story when you learn the reason for
the old gentlemans excursion down the
primrose path of dalliance you like him
all the better but you wrould be sure
to like him anyway

a a

in vivid relief to this story is james
hoppers tale of army life in the
philippines in the same issue of the
magazine it is called the smoke
and is a grim vigorous almost brutal
narrative as powerful and vital in mo-
tive and telling as anything we remem-
ber it was with stories of the philip-
pines that hopper first won a deserved
fame as a writer we have no hesitation
in saying that this new story is a little
better a little stronger and more vivid
than any of the earlier stories we
think you will agree with us when you
come to read it

a a

then once more in a lighter vein
although not without its-strong ele-
ment of suspense and excitement is
courtney ryley coopers story of a
poker game the burnt card and as
another example of thrilling and vigor-
ous narrative this time with its scene
laid in the west dane coolidges won-
derful story of a rattlesnake elder
brother and last but not least a
story which has perhaps in a greater
degree than any of them the compelling
power of a wholesome and hearty hu-
man interest blacklisted one of the
best baseball stories yet by charles e
van loan and these please to re-
member are only a few of the things
that go to make up a really notable is-

ctasiiiox takes its ease in midsum-
 mer relaxing the hard-and-fast
rules that usually govern and allowing
us to wear pretty much what we please
within the bounds of reason and season
the softness and naturalness which
rule present-day dress are even more
marked during the grilling days
lounge coats are devoid of stiffening
and lining waistcoats are put aside
trousers swing clear of the instep soft
collars soft shirts and abbreviated un-
dersuits are worn 
scarfs are of filmy
silks like foulard and
crape hats are of
feather-light straw 
hose are fine sheer
lisle  the circle of com-
fort is complete

  in hot-weather fab-
rics flannels are per-
haps the most fashion-
able these are cut
with plain or patch
pockets in the conven-
tional sack or the
newer norfolk style

the xorfolk while
primarily meant for
sports and the country
has become a sort of
all-round jacket
which is worn in town
and out on account of
its easy breezy idle-
hour air which is in
tune with the current
code of style

  some norfolks have

loose belts and some have strapped
others are cut with a conventional
sack front and a norfolk back all
norfolks should have patch pockets to
accentuate their confessedly loungy
look

  a notable feature of this summers
styles in norfolks and in all coats for
that matter is the placing of the waist-
line very high so as to make the wearer
seem tallish and long-limbed even the
short man can thus be lengthened out
to accord with the
vogue for slim-and-
trim figures as dis-
tinguished from the
old-fashioned ath-
letic figure with its
hulking shoulders and
sailor-broad back

  soft collars are an-
other quirk of fashion
a much favored type
is illustrated here it
is made of pique silk
or silk and cotton with
the deep curling points
to which young men
are very indulgent just
now the four-in-
hand broader than
hitherto is loosely
knotted and drawn up
between the tips these
deep-point collars are
also made in flexible
linen and may be worn
inside or outside the
waistcoat indeed this
deep-point shape is the

of diseased eyes successfully treated
without cutting or drugging

   that the eyes can be strengthened so that eyeglasses
                     can be dispensed with in many cases has been proven be-

                     publicly claim that their eyesight
