chapter i

a dead one laughs

captain fox elton sat
listening with polite interest to
the amazing conversation be-
tween the chiefs of the ameri-
can and french espionage services if the
black picture drawn by the frenchman
stirred him with uneasy foreboding there
was no hint of any such emotion in his
clear bjjft eyes and serenelfcm features

with
jrds
nsieur

le colonel ourq the american g- colo-
nel broke in sharply

  he shifted uncomfortably in his new
swivel chair and his ponderous red face
registered an irritated perplexity as one
whose credence is being imposed upon

  one moment you tell me that the
baron erich wolf von strindheim has
been put to the guillotine and in the next
breath you say it must be he who is oper-
ating the spy nest at paris

  but yes my colonel exclaimed the
frenchman earnestly i will risk my
name that it is none other than the baron
erich wolf von strindheim himself
  you mean the guillotine wasnt sharp
-or just how do you get him back on
earth after chopping off his head
colonel rands voice was peremptory

  the frenchman shrugged his shoulders
and spread his hands in a gesture of help-
lessness

  how can i say my colonel he re-
plied we kill von strindheim identi-
fication is perfect-the evidence most
complete one week maybe two and
voila-the baron is back again

  then i take it you killed the wrong
man is that the idea monsieur

  that my colonel is the deep mys-

tery said colonel ourq desperately

  the evidence of the barons death is
not to be disputed we have investi-
gated every possible ruse every trick-
and always we come back to the same
conclusion von strindheim is dead
for years the baron was under the surveil-
lance of our secret police in paris-yes for
seven years before the war i myself
knew him as i know you not until six
weeks ago were we able to trap him for
what he was the most dangerous man in
all the german spy system in f-tance i
myself with my own eyes saw his head
drop under the guillotine my colonel


ared white

and yet will i vow that baron erich wolf
von strindheim lives at this moment

  colonel rand got up to pace the floor
of the spacious intelligence office at
american headquarters iis face was
deeply lined mingled perplexity and
irritation at the end of several moments
of strained silence he halted directly in
front of the french officer and shot
another query at him

  but couldnt the baron with all his
gifts have trained some one else to his
methods some one to carry on his work
here in paris after he had become a-a
casualty so to speak

  colonel ourq responded with the in-
evitable shrug of negation

 but no never he exclaimed
adding fervently is it not so of all the
great geniuses-that they trained many
and yet no one who could approach their
own power the baron is a genius my
colonel an evil genius with the mind of
the devil and the sly cunning of a thou-
sand devils in some strange way von
strindheim has survived his own death
yes my colonel i see what is in your
mind my most brilliant operatives
touch a finger to their brows-thus-and
smile insinuatingly at me when my back
is turned yet it does not weaken my
certainty that the baron works in paris
today

  no doubt said colonel rand un-
convinced no doubt you have your
reasons but it does stump me to know
just where to begin cooperating with you
in view of the unusual french official
attitude that the man is dead and your
own insistence that he is alive certainly
it would help us if you would reconcile
the conflict of opinion by giving us your
theories in detail

  there are many theories one might
arrive at responded the french officer
but-mon dieu-how am i to reconcile
them on one hand as i have told you
i saw baron erich executed on the
other his evil genius continues to mock
us things happen that reveal to me
the barons incomparable technique the
devilish power of intrigue and evasion

that no other man could possess so fully-
no more than the matchless napoleon
could have had an understudy of power
equal to his own

  have you any concrete evidence of
the barons existence monsieur colonel
rand persisted in his unwillingness to
countenance so grotesque a theory even
from as clever a man as colonel ourq

  the french officer hesitated a mo-
ment then drew from the inner pocket
of his tunic a thin leather folder from
the folder he took a small green tinted
envelope and handed it with reluctance
to the american

  there is this which i will permit you
to see although it is as you will be able
to appreciate very embarrassing to me
said the frenchman

  colonel rand opened the envelope and
drew forth a sheet of fine linen paper upon
which was written the name-m le
colonel ourq-in french letters whose
shaping disclosed a german hand under
the address was an endless array of
figures of which rand was able to make
nothing

  code he inquired

  yes cipher von strindheims old
favorite cipher the one he used until we
broke it down finally since when to
the best of our knowledge he has used
none

  here elton said rand turning to
his assistant you are the code expert
of our official family what do you make
of this

captain elton took the
missive and scrutinized it care-
fully comparing the groupings
and arrangement of numerals
with german cipher messages he had
broken down in the past he con-
centrated upon the first grouping which
read

 - -------
- --

  it required only a few moments of
study to convince the young officer that
while undoubtedly it was a form of
the spy trap



alphabetical cipher hours even days of
patient labor would be required before
he could reduce the message to french
he handed the sheet of paper back to
colonel rand with a terse statement to
that effect

  but it reduces into english said the
frenchman that was von strind-
heims favorite prank one that foiled our
best experts for months here my colo-
nel i will give you the key and you shall
read it for yourself

  colonel ourq seated himself at rands
desk and quickly but painstakingly wrote
out the key handing it to the american
it read

      

	abcdefg

	hi j klmn

	opq rs tu

     	v w x y z

  you see messieurs colonel ourq
explained baron erich wolf von strind-
heim used a sort of plotting or map co-
ordinating system take the first figure
in his message- the first numeral
identifies the column from top to bottom
in the alphabet thus the numeral 
indicates that the letter is in the second
row the second numeral refers to the
position of the letter from left to right
thus the second  would place the letter
intended definitely as i it is the same
as plotting with map coordinates and
equally simple at the point in the table
where the numbers meet there is your
letter it took us many weary weeks of
effort to break the cipher down-largely
because it reduces into english but with
the key i have given you my colonel
any one may read it in a moment

  colonel rand instead of turning the
cipher over to his expert operative tried his
own skill upon it with the key before him
the mystic symbols yielded promptly
to intelligible words he took a pencil
and wrote-it out slowly at first then with
easy rapidity

   i - am

------- laughing

  - at -- you

  when he had completed the whole mes-
sage there lay before him this taunting
message

    i am laughing at you the german hauss-
  man you sent has met his just reward soon
  our imperial aftny shall invest paris and i ex-
  pect the honor of your presence at dinner at the
  hotel crillon with assurances of my pro-
  found amusement i beg to remain

                      -von strindheim

  my associates in the second bureau-
the frenchman hastened to explain the
color suffusing his cheeks as he observed
colonel rand had read the message-
all of them insist that it is nothing more
than a very clever forgery by a german
operative who has taken the barons place
very naturally they ask as you have
asked how could von strindheim write
this when he is dead but even they were
at a loss for words my colonel when the
most celebrated of our experts in hand-
writing pronounced the figures and the
signature in the handwriting of the baron
himself you see we had many estab-
lished specimens of his craft for purposes
of comparison

 colonel rand rubbed his wrinkled
brow vigorously

  you know how fond these prussians
are of grotesque tricks he protested
stoutly so if it is really von strind-
heims hand and not a forgery isnt it
more rational colonel to conclude that
the baron wrote it for use in event he
became a casualty so to speak an ante-
mortem trick-to muddy the water in
favor of his fellow operatives after his
own death

  ah but that very point was brought
up my colonel and as quickly settled
for a dozen experts testified that the ink
was not more than a few hours upon the
paper when it reached me through the
mails and that was a fortnight ago-a
full ten days after the barons supposed
demise of which i was an official witness
what is the reference to the german
haussman in the message inquired
rand does that have any-special
significance

  mon dieu my colonel that is the


ared white

terrible part of itall for months we
plan it haussman the german opera-
tive-a clever rogue to whom we made
the first quarter of a payment of one mil-
lion francs-one million francs to deliver to
us the information that would uncover the
prussian spy nest in paris fifty lives-
fifty of our own best operatives gone-
dead-no one knows how or where my
colonel they disappear forever once
they take up this deadly scent on the
trail of von strindheim in paris a
million francs was little enough to pay
the traitor haussman if he could reveal
their stronghold but in spite of our
own careful training our thorough
secrecy and haussmans own well
known cleverness you have read your-
self what happened to him even with-
out the evidence of von strindheims
signature i should have recognized this
as his work for there is none other en-
dowed with the devilish power to look
into mens minds and read their innermost
souls as he must have read haussmans

  the american colonel resumed his rest-
less pacing of the floor the while he rubbed
his forehead as if to induce a greater in-
tensity of thought while he sought to re-
duce the frenchmans remarkable state-
ments to some logical and coherent basis
one thing was certain-a baffling german
spy center operated in paris in defiance
of the best french efforts another thing
was equally certain-the german oper-
atives were furnishing the german im-
perial general staff with detailed informa-
tion of everything of military value that
occurred in france that was disclosed
by the messages which the astute elton
had deciphered a few days before when
he unearthed a german message center
within the american fighting lines in the
vosges mountains

  on the basis of eltons achievements
the idea of having him work with the
french in paris had been evolved-and
eagerly seized upon by the french espi-
onage bureau if elton had ferreted out
the transmission station in the red vosges
it was not incredible that he might be able
to pit his mind against the master spies

in the french capital but the french
espionage chieftains insistence that von
strindheim was the man to be sought did
not as colonel rand saw it put his star
assistant upon a tangible or hopeful trail
better that elton bend his efforts in other
directions than chase a will-o-the-wisp
of french imagination imagination possi-
bly warped by the stress of years of war

  colonel rand finally turned to elton

  what do you make of it all he in-
quired so far youve had a listening
role but since you are the one chiefly
concerned after all id like to have the
benefit of your opinion if you have any

  my experience as a government oper-
ative at home has taught me that any-
thing is possible elton said thoughtfully
even though a man has been executed it
is conceivable that in some miraculous
way he escaped death or another was
executed in his place but assuming
that baron erich wolf von strindheim is
alive by some miracle i cant fathom
why he would want to advertise his pres-
ence on earth cant you see how tre-
mendously it would be to his advantage
to have the allies think him dead

  thats something to explain said
colonel rand turning sharply to the
french officer the man youve pic-
tured to us colonel certainly would have
brains enough to make very good use of
such an advantage as being thought
dead

  colonel ourq forgot his politeness long
enough to laugh derisively

  ah but you do not reckon with the ar-
rogant vanity of von strindheim he
cried the barons vanity is his great
weakness his boastfulness is without
limit once he wrote to me boasting that
he had dined the night before in my own
home and-diable-i found the stub of
his monogrammed cigaret in my ash tray
another time he warned me that he would
visit the opera comique on a certain
evening still another time-i-but he is
forever boasting von strindheim my
colonel would rather die than be thought
dead the chase would lose its zest for
him he seems to like to think of himself
the spy trap



as a master craftsman giving what you
call the handicap to us who try to trap
him i have even messieurs found the
cigaret stub of von strindheim on the
floor of my own office a cigaret with a
coronet of gold over the initials vs

the american espionage
colonel studied his watch with-
out replying it was well past
midnight since early fore-
noon they had been closeted with colonel
ourq going over the baffling enigma of
the prussian spy center in paris pal-
pably they were at an impasse on the
subject of von strindheim and colonel
rand felt himself at the end of his pa-
tience as well as his endurance for the
time being he cleared his face of its
skeptical scowl and spoke with studied
politeness the politeness demanded by
official relations

  we are indebted to you monsieur le
colonel ourq he announced the
hour is very late and i fear we have
drawn upon your energies quite enough
for one day permit us to think upon
what you have said to examine the facts
you have been kind enough to give us-
and tomorrow we will meet with you
again to give you our answer-say at the
hour of noon

  as you will messieurs replied colo-
nel ourq he rose and bowed gravely
my services are at your disposal tomor-
row or for so long as you may desire un-
til twelve of the clock tomorrow adieu
when the french officer had bowed
himself out colonel rand turned to elton
and shook his head

  putting aside our friends slightly
shell shocked notions about von strind-
heim it is clear enough that the boche
spy nest in paris is pretty solidly en-
trenched he said gloomily whoever
it is thats running the thing he must be
pretty well equipped with brains dont
you say

  decidedly elton responded but
frankly i am not so skeptical of von
strindheims existence as you appear to
be sir	i

  you mean you accept that story of
the barons coming back to life elton
colonel rand said

  i wouldnt go so far as that but
theres some doubt after hearing the
whole story about who it was the french
executed yes even in the face of their
official witnesses who saw the execution
there may have been a mistake

  but elton its fatal to start into this
thing on a false assumption sticking
your head into a spy nest looking for a
man who according to all rational ac-
counts is dead-it doesnt sound very
promising to me

  that would be safer than ignoring a
clever rascal as dead when he was really
alive besides that isnt the most vital
part of it for that matter weve got to
consider every angle but theres one
thing sir that must not be lost sight of
at any time its no ordinary mortal we
have to deal with in any event

  colonel rand shook himself and sup-
pressed a yawn

  well lets sleep on it he said with
finality you go over the case in detail
in the morning and let me know what you
think after a nights sleep if fifty french
operatives have disappeared to date im
not in any hurry to have our own most
valuable operative gobbled up in the
black void of underground paris al-
though-if we thought there was a chance
of getting anywhere-its worth any risk
to stop those boche espions from tip-
ping everything to the german army in
advance

  very good sir said elton noncha-
lantly ill go over everything ourq told
us and see what the situation looks like
after a detailed analysis good night
sir

chapter ii

the first steps

instead of going to his quarters for
sleep upon leaving the american
espionage chief captain elton walked
down the long dark corridor of the stone
headquarters building and entered his


ared white

own cheerless cubbyhole of an office the
room once the quarters of an important
french sous-officier when the place was
part of a french regimental garrison
grudgingly yielded room for eltons broad
desk and the jumbled piles f books which
he used in his specialty of reducing ger-
man cipher and code messages into plain
english

  there was no thought of sleep never
in his career as a department of justice
operative before he was loaned to the
army for use in the war had elton faced
a case that presented so many difficult
aspects at the outset such danger cer-
tainly ordinary methods would not apply
in a case where more than two-score french
operatives had vanished if he could
hope to succeed where they had failed
it would mean the most painstaking prep-
aration of his work and the cleverest use
of his resources and wits once he had
taken up the trail even then it might
be little better than an impudent gamble
with death

  elton turned first to the two photo-
graphs which the french colonel had
furnished him of the elusive and mysteri-
ous baron erich wolf von strindheim it
was this amazing personality who quick-
ened his interest the man who had
baffled the whole of the french secret
service who had played hide-and-seek
with his life with a recklessness that had
astounded his pursuers first of all must
be settled the question of whether von
strindheim really lived or was repre-
sented by an exceptionally gifted disciple
of von strindheims own training

 the first of the two photographs
showed the baron as a young officer in the
uniform of a prussian grenadier regiment
it dated back no less than a dozen years
long before von strindheim came to
france perhaps even before he had em-
barked upon his career in the secret ser-
vice elton sat looking at it intently for
many minutes not without a certain ad-
miration for the cold arrogant features
that revealed something of the agile re-
sourceful mind of the man

 the von strindheim eyes and mouth

were the two outstanding features in the
fellows remarkable face elton could
see even from an uncolored photograph
of ancient vintage that the eyes were a
peculiar translucent gray that laughed in
a cold mocking sort of way the lips
were thin and straight except at the ends
where they curled sharply downward into
the hint of a sneer his face was full
without being fat finely molded with
an aquiline nose that just escaped being
hawk-like his brow and hair were
covered by his military cap set at a
rakish angle so that the vizor dipped
close above his left eye and concealed
his hair such of the physique as was
shown by the picture was that of a rather
slight well knit man square- shouldered
and stiffly erect

  an older man was revealed by the
second photograph it was a french
official photograph taken at le bourget
just before the victims head fell under
the blade of a military guillotine elton
reckoned that von strindheim must have
been twenty-five when he posed for the
first camera the later french photo
was that of a man in his middle thirties
these years had only slightly changed the
von strindheim features the eyes were
colder and harder and had lost the in-
sulting amusement with which they once
had looked out upon the world natural
enough in view of the fact that the man
awaited the guillotine the line of the
mouth was thinner and firmer and the
curve at the ends drawn more sharply
under a powerful glass elton noted too
that the second von strindheim picture
lacked the fire and mental elan of the
first there was something about it that
suggested a lesser personage than that
revealed by the first years of peril and
imminence of death might fully account
for that

  when at last he had completed his
scrutiny of the two photographs of von
strindheim elton settled back in his chair
and fixed his mind intentjv upon the de-
tailed disclosures made by the french
colonel hours of thoughtful comparison
and analysis of every pertinent fact and
the spy trap



theory that colonel ourq had advanced
during the day shed no new light upon
the grim facts of german spy operations
in paris nor was there anything to be
found in the frenchmans grim outline of
the situation that offered encouragement
to the boldest and most resourceful
american operative

there was really no length
to which the french military
authorities had not gone at
five successive places they had
located the secret lair in paris-and each
time had seized the place with an armed
poilu platoon after disguised operatives
failed to return each time the french
moved in with force it was to find them-
selves holding the empty bag the ger-
mans had simply moved on leaving an
empty trail behind them it was clear
that in the years before the war they had
planned with infinite pains for just such
contingencies when smoked out it was
simply a matter of moving on to another
prepared position much as a front line
battalion retires into successive lines of
trenches and strongholds in the face of
irresistible battle pressure

  only by the sheerest good fortune had
colonel ourqs operatives picked up the
trail again following the arrest and execu-
tion of von strindheim and the smashing
of a rendezvous in the rue pigalle two
french operatives had trailed a suspect
to a medieval stone building on the rue
chambron a week before one of them
had followed the fellow into the dilapi-
dated cafe on the ground floor of the build-
ing when three hours later he had not
emerged his associate sounded the alarm
the french espionage chief himself pre-
vented an armed rush upon the building
each time that he had smothered a nest
with force it had taken weeks months of
effort to get track of the new rendezvous
so he decided to approach the problem
more circumspectly in order to allay
possible suspicion he caused a desul-
tory search to be made of the entire
neighborhood and then left the sus-
pected nest in peace intent upon devis-

ing some more subtle means of approach

  first m le colonel spent a week in dis-
creet investigation of the past and present
history of the building under suspicion
this yielded nothing the place was the
undisputed ancestral property of an
officer of the french army now with his
regiment at the front the upper floors
were used as a cheap lodging for river
workers along the nearby river seine
the ground floor was occupied by a small
french cafe of the cheapest and shabbiest
class the frenchman who conducted
these humble enterprises was of unques-
tioned loyalty except for the undisputed
fact that another of his operatives had
disappeared mysteriously upon entering
the place-a fact having the von strind-
heim earmarks-colonel ourq might have
been satisfied to drop the place from ob-
servation as it was he finally used the
traitor haussman only to receive the
mocking letter of a few days later signed
von strindheim

by sunrise captain elton
had reached one very definite
conclusion one master con-
tinued to direct the destiny of
the german spy center in paris no mere
successor to the brilliant operative who
conducted the work in the early stages
of the war could have carried on with
such unerring certainty more particu-
larly a successor would not have de-
veloped the arrogant confidence in him-
self to flaunt his victories in the french
official face so soon after von strindheims
demise perhaps he concluded the
french had executed von strindheim at
le bourget but they had not put to
sleep the sinister mind that moved the
pawns in the game of military espionage
inside the french lines

  shortly before noon when he reported
for the conference with the espionage
chiefs colonel rand greeted him im-
patiently

  well elton what do you make of it
all after a nights sleep the colonel in-
quired

  i havent had a nights sleep sir


ared white

elton smiled in fact i havent had
my uniform off or closed my eyes

  you certainly look like a man whos
slept exclaimed colonel rand not
even red around the eyes however
thats not the point sleep or no sleep
whats the situation ourq will be here
in a moment to know whether youre go-
ing to try your hand at his fox hunt
whats the answer

  tell him no-most emphatically
said elton

  it doesnt look good to you eh

  not very inviting sir-and please
leave no uncertainty in his mind that i
if i have any choice in the matter wash
my hands of the whole mess

  colonel rand scowled at the floor
briefly

  i think youre using your head
elton he replied what chance would
we have mixing in with this ancient spy
game which theyve been playing so many
centuries theyve got it down to a fine art
weve got need enough of you here
colonel ourq entered in a minute ex-
pectant but not unmindful of the courte-
sies demanded by french military cus-
tom he bowed and saluted made ele-
gant inquiry after the health of both
officers as to whether they had rested
well and waited patiently for the ameri-
can colonel to broach the subject of official
business

  we have decided monsieur le colonel
that we can not spare captain elton to
assist you at this time colonel rand
announced this decision bluntly when
the amenities finally had been disposed
of you see elton is the one really
expert cipher man weve got to depend
on-

  ah but it is only the officer who can
break down cipher who could hope for
success put in the frenchman his long
thin face registering disappointment at
the americans words i had hoped
perhaps messieurs you would see your
way clear to help us in this most impor-
tant of all cases

  im sorry monsieur le colonel
colonel rand said with finality but i

left the decision to the captain and i
take it he does not feel his experience or
his knowledge of paris would justify such
presumption as to conclude he might win
where you have failed

  i am sorry said ourq gloomily bow-
ing his acceptance of the verdict in his
disappointment he betrayed the shame
less reason for wishing to inveigle the
american operatives into the chase i
had thought perhaps that if the ameri-
cans also failed those of my own superiors
who now criticize me might become more
indulgent of my efforts adieu mes-
sieurs

  may i ask monsieur le colonel one
question captain elton said did
i understand you correctly as saying yes-
terday that you have a german spy under
observation at the american aviation
center at orly

  ay yes captain colonel ourq
looked searchingly at the american cap-
tain for a moment as if to divine the rea-
son for the question then added but
may i most respectfully request my
comrades that you do not molest the
wretch an ordinary espion of no great
consequence i assure you but perhaps
one of von strindheims army he serves
as an american ground corporal and our
hope is that his trail may lead us one day
to his master if we but have patience
thank you said elton nonchalantly
i was merely a bit curious-and i assure
you that i will in no way molest your
spy or spoil your plan of watching his
trail

  certainly not when the french re-
quest it colonel rand spoke up we
want to cooperate in every way possible
with the french secret service

  colonel ourq bowed his acknowledg-
ment of the colonels assurance clicked
his heels saluted perfectly and departed

thank heaven thats over
said colonel rand now we
can get back to our own busi-
ness again

  but sir im afraid it isnt over
said captain elton politely and be-
the spy trap



sides isnt that paris nest our business
our most important business

  the colonel turned sharply upon his
junior officer

  what do you mean by that amazing
statement please tell me he demanded

  i mean sir said elton that ive
decided to try my hand and wits at
hound and fox to go to the bottom of this
thing and smoke out the kaisers pet
espion in paris

  you mean- colonel rand broke off
into speechlessness and stood staring at
elton for several moments didnt you
just tell me ten minutes ago that youd
decided to do nothing of the sort

  no sir i recall making no such state-
ment to the colonel

  see here elton if this is some sort
of silly jest youre carrying it too far
my hearing is perfect my senses normal
now just what is it you would have me
believe that my ears heard

  but if the colonel will recall my
words i requested you to tell the french-
man i had refused to tackle the job
quite the same thing just what are
you driving at

  simply this sir i didnt want colo-
nel ourq to know what im about its
a mighty ticklish game im up against
at best-and i didnt want a lot of french
intelligence officers to know about it in
advance im even sorry its necessary for
you to know whats up and i must have
your word that no one else will be let in
on it-not even the general

  colonel rand was left staring again
youve sized this game up and appre-
ciate just what youre up against

  perfectly its a long shot but i
worked out my preliminary plans and im
going to put them into execution

  what are they

  captain elton pursed his lips and
smiled enigmatically

  if the colonel will excuse me he
replied ill keep that to myself

  my experience and advice in this work
might be very helpful to you elton i
might point out something you have over-
looked

  i appreciate that fact sir but i fear
we might not agree-especially on the
subject of von strindheim besides if i
keep my own counsel ill not have to
worry about the danger of official compli-
cations-such as the general asking you
and then letting a word drop to the
french of what i was about

  von strindheim colonel rand bit
the word out youre not accepting any
of that nonsense from ourq i hope as a
basis for starting your work if you are
youd better stay where you are that
paris spy nest is not any branch of the
home for feeble minded

  im not accepting it and im not re-
jecting it im going in with an open
mind on that subject but with my mind
made up on one point the man i must
deal with is just as clever as von strind-
heim is described as being at least you
will agree to that much

  the colonel indulged in his favorite
thought provoking habit of rubbing his
forehead vigorously

  well i admire your spine elton if
not your judgment but then you sur-
prised me when you landed that boche
nest outin the vosges last week which
reminds me that you have a promotion to
major coming whenever youre ready to
take the oath of office

  i think that can wait sir i want to
do nothing that will attract attention of
any sort my way right now as a matter
of fact im about to take a reduction to
the ranks and change my name

  going to work under a cover-up eh
well what is it to be this time-a second
lieutenant or something of that sort

  a sergeant sir sergeant strothers
replacement casual i knew of such a
man in the cavalry on the border-a de-
serter he was killed a year ago in the
foothills near chihuahua mexico under
circumstances that i alone know in detail
therefore i am willing to risk that name
and now sir i request that as sergeant
strothers i be assigned immediately to
the aviation service at orly-along with
say a dozen other replacements

  see here elton colonel rand ex-


ared white

claimed as he divined the captains ap-
parent purpose we promised not to
bother that spy down there as ourq
told us the french are working on him
and its bad business to break faith

  i had no such idea as that said
elton one other request if i get into
trouble with the american commander
down there i want no help of any kind
from headquarters no matter what the
trouble is im on my own even if i
get into a court-martial jam and am sent
up for ten years also transfer sergeant
walters from here to headquarters at
paris with secret instructions to report at
the prison la roquette or m p head-
quarters at any time any one sends for
him

  colonel rand shook his head dubiously

  i hope you know what youre about
elton this is no picnic youre embarking
upon

  after all replied elton calmly its
no more dangerous than the job held by
a few million men who are fighting at the
front and as old sergeant walters
would say-its all a part of the war game
anyhow

chapter iii

the deserter

he journey from american
headquarters to the aviation assem-
bly center at orly might have been
made in five hours by military automo-
bile or in two hours by plane either
kind of transportation was immediately
available to an officer on a secret mission
of the gravest importance to the whole
allied cause but elton chose the more
leisurely method of proceeding south to
st aignan where he lost two precious
days-one day in travel and one in taking
his place as an enlisted casual in a re-
placement battalion another three days
elapsed before he arrived at the aviation
center but his presence there as one of
twelve replacement casuals who had been
duly requisitioned weeks before was
natural and logical a mere matter of
military routine

  on the left sleeve of eltons blouse
when he reported at orly was the tell-
tale markings of faded military glory-
an unbleached area that betrayed recently
removed chevrons the pseudo ex-ser-
geant had brought this reduction upon
himself with deliberation while at st
aignan by the simple expedient of ad-
dressing a haughty second lieutenant
without proper respect and deference
as he had expected the evidence of re-
duced grade was seized upon promptly at
orly with mingled sympathy and suspi-
cion-sympathy from the privates in the
squadrons ground force suspicion from
officers and non-coms who reasoned logi-
cally that a busted sergeant was a person
to be kept under observation

  from among the most voluble and un-
couth of the privates in the squadron
elton carefully selected one as a confi-
dant a soldier with a large mouth a
noisy tongue and a ready sympathy for
those who had felt the iron hand of dis-
cipline on the second day at his new
station elton functioning under the
nom de guerre of private strothers took
his new buddy into his confidence and
poured his troubles into the others sym-
pathetic ear he had been reduced to the
ranks because of a miraculous run of hard
luck some one had recognized him as
a deserter from mexican border days
only a miracle of friendship on his cap-
tains part had saved him from being
tried but it had not saved him from
being stripped of his chevrons and fed out
as a replacement

  exactly as elton had expected his
confidence was betrayed by his gossiping
comrade before reveille the next morning
by the end of the next day every man in
the squadron knew that the new casual
private strothers was a fellow with a hard
record a deserter from the army on the
mexican border by the third day the
report had traveled the military grape-
vine to the first sergeants ear shortly
after mess on that day elton received a
summons from the squadron adjutant
a bumptious youngster bustling with
authority whose peculiarities elton had
the spy trap



estimated carefully in advance of the in-
evitable interview

who gave you the fine no-
tion that we wanted deserters
in this outfit the lieutenant
demanded by way of introduc-
ing the reason for the summons

  maybe you know what youre talk-
ing about i dont replied the bogus
strothers bluntly

  you dont eh gasped the young
officer the affront to his dignity en-
raged him youve had some military
service havent you he roared

  a year or so the private admitted
casually

  ever been taught how to address an
officer

  yes an officer who acts like one was
the pointed reply

  damn your impudent hide what do
you mean by that the lieutenant was
purple with rage by this time

  the privates mood was inflexible

  exactly what i said he replied
you act more like a petulant baby than
an officer of the united states army

  id-id put you under arrest for
that roared the lieutenant thats
disrespect to your superior officer-thats
worse-thats- he broke off into im-
potent stuttering

  well dont get all fussed up what
you want to see me about was the
privates unruffled inquiry

  youre a deserter thats what i want
to see you about barked the officer
pointing a tense finger of accusation
straight at the soldier

  how can i be a deserter lieutenant
when im standing right here in quarters
listening to your guff this very minute
sneer that off if you know how

  if you address me like that again-ill
-ill have you chucked in the hoosegow
i got it straight youre a deserter
skipped the army on the border and
came sneaking back in thought we
wouldnt get wise to you

  whoever says i deserted is an infernal
liar the private shot back

  i say it we got the record on you
we got your own confession to one of the
squadron here now lets hear you call
me a liar

  with pleasure lieutenant youre
a dyed-in-the-wool triple fanged oily
tongued liar of the deepest dye now
swallow that and blow up until you bust
for all i care

  orderly call out the guard put
this yellow cur under arrest the
lieutenant bellowed at the top of his
voice

  you cant talk to me like that and
get away with it roared the chev-
ronless soldier suddenly stirring into
action

  youll get twenty years in leaven-
worth-or thirty-for this   

  how many years the officer might have
added to his prediction of the soldiers
probable sentence was not disclosed he
was interrupted by a hand of steel at the
collar of his uniform elton dragged the
lieutenant out of headquarters with a few
lusty jerks of his arm before the head-
quarters clerks and orderlies could inter-
fere they saw the adjutant out in the
open alternately jerked and slapped as
helpless as a child on the horns of a bull
though his assailant was a somewhat
smaller man

  as half a dozen soldiers headed by a
first sergeant came rushing down upon
this astounding exhibition of insubordi-
nation elton discreetly released his hold
and stepped back

  arrest that man screamed the ad-
jutant throw him in the hoosegow-
and shoot him down if he tries to make a
getaway

  the first sergeant himself seized elton
roughly and remembered to salute the
adjutant with his free hand

  hell not get away sir said the ser-
geant grimly we all saw it sir

  the mans a lunatic or a dangerous
criminal i tell you the breathless
officer gasped assaulted me without
provocation-most unheard of outrage in
my whole service

  he tried to call me a desertergrowled


ared white

the prisoner im not taking that kind
of talk from any one

  youll take a lot of things you aint
never thought of before sneered the
first sergeant jerking the soldier back
again and shoving him into the custody
of half a dozen soldiers take that bird
to the cooler shoot him if he tries to
bolt

  two-thirds of the squadron had ap-
peared magically at the scene by this
time gaping speechlessly at the man who
had dared strike his superior officer in
time of war it was a firing squad offense
if a court martial chose to go the limit
of military law certainly a matter of
ten years imprisonment even before a
tender hearted military tribunal the
prisoner yielded without show of resis-
tance and went off placidly with the
escort

  thats a fine mornings work youve
pulled for yourself the corporal in
charge of the guard detail greeted him
what kind of hop you filled up on any-
how

  im not having any ex-bank clerk in
a sam browne bawling me out like i was
a mangy setter said the prisoner he
started it

  yes-and he finished it didnt he
said the corporal dont you know you
cant get away with that kind of rough
stuff against an officer

  would you let some shavetail abuse
you and call you a deserter the un-
humbled offender asked sharply

  sure i would affirmed the non-com
unblushingly id let em call me any-
thing its their privilege not saying
i aint got a temper and a right smart
memory but im waiting until were
back in civvies after the war so i can do
a first class job or two of it without having
to spend the rest of my natural life in
jail

  well the jig was up anyhow the
other smiled stoically he had enough
on me to cinch me for some old offense i
thought theyd forgotten so i reckon my
fun didnt cost me much

  bad head work again said the cor-

poral if you meant that old desertion
charge thats been rumored around here-
why youd got out of that easy longside
what youre going to get now next to
murder hitting an officer is the unsafest
stunt in the army fact is i dont
think theyd done anything to you on
that desertion charge seeing as how
you come back to do your stuff in the
war

  well let it go at that the recalci-
trant private ended the exchange he
smiled vaguely anyhow its my own
funeral

if elton had any remaining
uncertainties as to the serious
course that was to follow they
were removed swiftly charges
and specifications were read to him in an
irate voice by the squadron major before
the end of the day they charged major
violation of the article of war a case for
a general court martial the hands of
justice moved swiftly thereafter since
the prisoner refused to make an official
statement in his own behalf and took
refuge in what passed for a sullen silence
he was whisked away the following morn-
ing to face the military tribunal at paris
headquarters

  his trial was brief and ominous a
dozen somber faced officers comprising
the court sat in flinty silence through a
recital of the facts by the outraged lieu-
tenant the first sergeant and several eye-
witnesses who corroborated everything
the lieutenant charged elton in turn
gloomily admitted the offense and pleaded
merely that he had lost his temper the
court went into closed session and re-
convened with findings determined upon
almost as quickly as the prisoner could be
escorted from the room and led back
again a stony faced lieutenant-colonel
possessed of a deep funereal voice arose to
announce the findings of the court and
pronounce the sentence

  of the charges-guilty he said of
all the specifications-guilty the sen-
tence is dishonorable discharge from the
service forfeiture of all pay and allow-
the spy trap



ances and confinement to a military
prison at hard labor for a period of twenty-
five years

  thats an outrage gentlemen the
prisoner advanced a step toward the
court pointing a menacing finger at the
members i demand-

  his sentence was cut off by a rough
hand at his arm the sergeant in charge
of the guard of three armed military
policemen the sergeant hustled him out
of the room

  any more wisecracks out of you and
ill drill you the non-com stormed
me i think youre a loco case but you
better not start anything while i got you
on my hands

  at military police headquarters on rue
st anne to which the prisoner was taken
for transportation to prison la roquette
elton finally prevailed upon the officer in
charge to grant him a last request-that
of notifying sergeant walters at paris
headquarters of his predicament

  if its giving you any comfort to ad-
vertise your crimes to your friends ill
tell him you want to see him the m p
officer said but if i was in for the kind
of a crime you pulled i wouldnt want
decent friends to know anything about
it

  thank you sir said the prisoner
humbly itll cheer me a lot if i
can have a few words with my old
buddy

  an hour later the veteran sergeant
walters military intelligence operator
and ally of elton in his recent desperate
invasion of the belfort spy nest appeared
at the prison he eyed the m p officer in
a puzzled way when informed that private
strothers convicted of striking an officer
wanted to see him before being transferred
to la roquette

  i dont remember the name off hand
said walters but then ive known a lot
of hard eggs in my service

  this is a tough one said the officer
better keep your eyes on him he may
have some fast trick up his sleeve the
corporal here will take you up to the
fifth floor

not even his long experi-
ence in facing strange and un-
expected situations prevented
an exclamation from sergeant
walters when he saw through the bars
of a small cell the familiar features of
captain elton in privates uniform and
secured to an iron bunk by a heavy chain
manacle

  why sir- walters bit off his words
in sudden recollection that there must be
some good reason for the others dire
predicament so they got you in here
have they strothers he inquired
didnt recognize the name at first
what you want to see me about

  its something personal sergeant
said the prisoner word i want sent to
my folks without anybody else knowing
who they are

  fair enough said walters he
motioned the sentry aside out of hearing
whats the meaning of all this sir he
inquired eagerly i knew there was
something in the air when they sent me
down to paris but i didnt-

  im in a peck of real trouble said
elton beyond that i tell nothing at
present im to be transferred to the
prison la roquette this afternoon i
want you to arrange the escort and have
charge of it yourself ill tell you what
else i want you to do later

  ill jump back to headquarters and
fix that up easy enough said walters
only too glad to have a part in what-
ever youre doing but i cant see-
a ticklish job in which im playing a
lone game walters youll even tell the
commander of paris that im a prisoner
in whom higher authority is taking no
chance of a getaway thatll be the
reason you are taking over the job of
landing me at la roquette can you
put that across

  they got their orders to let me do as i
please so itll be easy walters smiled
but dont i get in on the racket some-
where

  youll be in lots of trouble before
night-and ill be out elton said
now please act as fast as you know


ared white

how and be sure to tell this paris crew
nothing

chapter iv

the kaisers wineshop

  an hour later the forlorn private
was duly surrendered by the
american military police of the
district of paris into the custody of an
armed detachment dispatched by the
american commander of troops in paris
to deliver him to the ancient french
prison that had been turned over for
american military use the order was
that every precaution be taken against
escape the escort of twelve men was
armed with rifles bayonets fixed maga-
zines filled with ball ammunition which
meant that the prisoner must arrive at
la roquette at the other side of paris
dead or alive

  sergeant walters automatic pistol in
his belt flap unfastened marched beside
the convicted man the escort under his
command followed in columns of threes
ten paces in rear they moved in silence
through the narrow traffic congested
rue st anne the french civil populace
yielding the sidewalk to them and gaping
from the gutters at the strange cavalcade
fragments of excited comment reached
the escort as it moved along the streets
imaginative frenchmen quickly solved
the riddle to their own satisfaction

  the soldiers were a firing squad the
american walking beside the sous-officier
the disheveled one with a stubbly face and
wretched eyes was a spy they were
taking him to the seine to shoot him and
cast his body into the muddy water
that was the american way groups
began following on the flanks and rear
men boys and old women as the escort
and its victim moved into the less fre-
quented streets to the east a motley
rabble was trailing closely drawn by the
wartime blood lust the grim fascination
of seeing a firing squad perform

  the prisoners anxiety became real at
this unexpected development he ad-
dressed sergeant walters sotto voce with-

out turning his head from the front

  so far that mob has played into my
hands he said but weve got to shake
them now-at least force them back to a
safe distance theyre dangerous enough
to spoil everything and ive got chances
enough to take in the next half hour
ill get rid of them sir whispered
walters

  he halted the escort and gave terse
orders to one of his corporals who spoke
french fluently the corporal harangued
the crowd back but it retreated only a
few paces again and again he shouted
to no avail until sergeant walters or-
dered the rear set of fours upon them
with the threat of fixed bayonets where-
upon they withdrew into the next square
and followed at a discreet distance

  at the next intersection said elton
at the end of an interminable period of
marching im going to leave you and
take your pistol with me

  sergeant walters looked sharply at
elton fear in his face

  my men know nothing he whispered
hoarsely theyll fire with ball ammu-
nition if you make a play like that

  its up to you to hold their fire while
im keeping you covered elton replied
in a low tense voice as soon as im
clear around the first corner you can
turn them loose after that hunt me like
you meant business in fact itll be your
business to hunt me down in earnest-if
you can but after a day or two if you
dont get my trail drop it is that per-
fectly clear to you

  the sergeant did not reply for a mo-
ment or two his eyes were on the cobble-
stones under his feet he ran his fingers
unconsciously across the row of service
ribbons on his left breast his hand paus-
ing a moment upon the blue ribbon
with tiny white stars-the congressional
medal of honor for distinguished bravery
in action

  its the toughest thing ive ever been
asked to do sir he replied presently
no armed prisoner this side of hell could
bluff me-and its a painful thing to
show the white feather right here before
the spy trap



an armed escort with a couple of hundred
frogs looking on from the background
im sorry walters i know what
theyll think but theres no way around
it this is one case where it takes more
guts to show yellow than to take a ma-
chine gun nest

  aint there some other way sir
walters persisted plaintively the revolt
in his soul against such a coup was
clearly revealed by his voice cant i
turn this escort back and then you and
me bolt it together

  see here walters elton spoke so
sharply that the sergeant raised his hand
in warning lest their exchange be over-
heard by the men in rear ive spent
days of misery and preparation leading
up to this moment everything depends
upon my next move ive told you al-
ready more than i wanted any one to
know this is the most important game
either of us ever sat in on-and every-
thing depends upon the next fifteen
minutes are you going to lend a hand
walters groaned

  go ahead sir when youre ready
he said ill take the gaff if theres no
way out of it

  they approached the intersection
streets lined with stone houses that stood
in a solid wall flush upon the sidewalk
eltons pulse was pounding in spite of his
effort at calm not only his life but the
possibility of success for his military
mission must depend upon the eventual-
ities of the next few minutes if fortune
frowned upon him his own men might
shoot him down if he succeeded in this
desperate move it might only be to dis-
appear into the black fastness that had
swallowed up the flower of the french
secret service

  now

he shot the warning at
walters as they came within a
stone throw of the rue des-
manse at the same moment
he whipped his hand across to the ser-
geants unfastened pistol holster whipped
out the army automatic and thrust its

ominous muzzle close to walters head
the alert soldiers of the escort swung
their rifles from their shoulders ready for
action in a twinkling a dozen muzzles
loomed hungrily forward safety locks re-
leased fingers on triggers only the
presence of sergeant walters directly in
the line of fire saved elton from instant
death

  order them to hold their fire the
prisoner shouted

  sergeant walters faced his command
dumbly and lifted his hand his face
had his men observed closely was filled
with disgust rather than fear as he halted
them and called to them to order arms
elton backed slowly toward the corner
walters trailing closely as a shield even
in the stress of this critical moment he
read the black despair in walters ashen
face walters shuffled along in silence
sick at heart twelve soldiers and two
hundred french civilians witnesses of this
humiliation an american non-com-
missioned officer weakening at the threat
of a pistol for no better apparent reason
than to preserve his own cowardly carcass
an outrage against all decent traditions
of the service

  im sorry elton consoled him

  its the toughest thing i ever tried
said walters grimly but take care of
yourself sir and good luck to you

  thanks walters ill need your good
wishes

  he broke around the corner without
another word by running at top speed
he had estimated that he would be able
to reach a turn in the tortuous thorough-
fare that would shield him from gunfire
and enable him to reach a second turn and
a third that would take him unto the rue
chambron he had barely reached the
first turn before the first scattering fire
was at his heels the bullets spattering
harmlessly against the buildings as the
soldiers fired at him with unsteady aim
from the run he made the second turn
ahead of their fire and rounded the third
barely in time to escape a shower of steel
jacketed lead which spattered the walls
behind him


ared white

  upon rounding the ancient stone
structure that marked his entrance into
rue chambron elton halted and peered
cautiously back the escort was racing
madly toward him and would have him
in the open in a few moments and while
elton knew the lay of paris he needed a
few extra moments just now in which to
orient himself against his final move
he swung his pistol around the corner of
the sheltering house and fired deliber-
ately upon the patrol taking care to aim
well over the heads of the men the in-
fantrymen scattered to the gutters cast-
ing themselves on their bellies in order to
escape bullets and steady their aim
elton used the precious respite in which
to catch the lay of the rue chambron
although he had seen it only in the
french intelligence photographs fur-
nished by colonel ourq he instantly
identified the age worn old stone rookery
that was his destination it stood not
thirty paces away bleak and forbidding
with no sign of life even in the grimy cafe
that occupied a section of the ground
floor

  with a final cautioning shot to check
his pursuers he bolted for the place
fortune seemed to favor him the
street was deserted before the first of
the infantrymen could come into sight
elton shot into the open door and rushed
wildly through the empty room only to
collide violently with a perspiring fat man
in a caterers apron and cap the fat
man instead of showing fear at the ap-
parition of an armed invader broke into
strident french epithets

  hide me out and be quick about it
the fugitive gasped flourishing his pistol
without leveling it

  to eltons surprise the fellows anger
cooled instantly he looked back at the
american collectedly without surprise or
other emotion

  je ne comprends pas anglais he said
with an indifferent shrug of his porcine
shoulders

  quick-tout de suite elton com-
manded

  he pointed to the floor and raised his

pistol again in a desperate gesture at
the same moment a fusillade of shots
rang out in the rue chambron the
frenchman as if in sudden understand-
ing of the situation led elton into the
dingy kitchen of the place lifted a worn
timber door from the floor and motioned
elton down the stone steps into the
musty cellar

  if you tip me off to the american
soldiers itll be finis for you the fugitive
shouted back with a significant toss of
his pistol

  the frenchman let the door fall into
place with a noisy bang the closing of
the hole left the cellar as black as hades
so black that elton could only grope his
way blindly until he came against a wall
and stood there in helplessness to await
developments a clatter of hobnails on
the wooden floor of the cafe overhead
heralded the arrival of the pursuit de-
tachment in a few moments he caught
the hum of excited voices and vaguely
made out that they were demanding his
hiding place

  open up your basement-or into the
american hoosegow you go

elton heard the stentorian
demand clearly and caught the
scraping of hobs toward the
kitchen in desperation he
struck a match and looked about him for
a way of escape from this menace the
light only brought a groan the cellar
was a small affair securely walled in-a
mere hole for the storage of a few barrels
of cheap wine he had brought up at the
end of a blind trail after all his effort at
making a plausible approach in a few
moments the infantrymen would search
him out and escort him back in failure to
face the humiliation of appealing after all
to headquarters for release

  the soldiers were lifting the heavy trap
door overhead when a soft voice spoke
close behind him

  enter monsieur it bade him

  elton started at the intervention sur-
prised in spite of his preparations for any
developments once he had entered the
the spy trap



cafe on the rue chambron he turned
to see a rift in the solid wall a rift that
was revealed by a broad shaft of mellow
light in which stood a man into this
refuge he darted not a moment too soon
light from overhead was penetrating the
hole and he caught the rasp of hobnails
on the stone steps leading from the
kitchen as the wall behind him closed as
suddenly and as noiselessly as it had
opened the light flashed out and he
found himself again standing in inky
blackness

  indistinctly he could make out the
scurrying about of the searchers in the
wine cellar a few feet away shortly the
sounds died out the escort evidently
having satisfied itself and turned its quest
elsewhere there was no sound now but
the pounding of his own heart eltons
veins ran hot with conflicting emotions
there was a sense of triumph that he had
succeeded in the first vital step of his
mission there was the tingling of taut
nerves at the realization that he now
faced the most desperate spy nest in all
europe slowly but surely while the
black room favored him he imposed his
iron will upon himself and collected his
faculties against the inevitable develop-
ments of the immediate future

  the light snapped on presently and re-
vealed another small stone lined wall
dark and almost as dismal and uninviting
as the wine cellar behind it was devoid
of fixtures except for a table and a
single chair at which sat an elderly
man his attire covered by a loose black
smock

  que voulez vous monsieur the fellow
inquired in the same easy voice that had
invited elton into the room

  no compree french elton replied
glumly got anybody here that can talk
american

  the other did not reply at once he
sat with his eyes fixed upon elton im-
personal little eyes over which the lids
drooped in a way that suggested a man
of small alertness elton looked back
studying the fellow intently without ap-
pearing to do so a man approaching

fifty spare angular with lined face of
little character probably a mere outer
sentinel a doorkeeper in the under-
ground network beyond elton thought
certainly not one to arouse suspicion by
his manner and appearance

  what brings you here the fellow
asked in good english at the end of a long
interval

  dodging twenty-five years in the
hoosegow said elton bluntly im sure
much obliged to you for helping me slip
that american wolf pack

  the interrogators face underwent not
the slightest change evidently he was a
man who felt no emotion

  tell me your whole story in detail
he prompted elton laconically

  theres not much of it my friend
elton said they were sending me to do
a quarter of a century for striking an
officer i saw a chance to try a getaway-
and here i am

  the other picked up a pencil and very
deliberately moved a pad of paper in front
of him

  i want all the details he persisted
everything thats happened from the
time you joined the service right on down
to this moment

  elton with a show of reluctance
sketched in the life of strothers in
this he was not forced to improvise
he had studied and rehearsed the role
of strothers

  furthermore he now clung to what
he esteemed to be the mental attitude of
strothers for the time being he was not
elton of the american military intelli-
gence service but the hounded private
victim of iron fisted and unreasoning in-
justice chafing with resentment burning
with his wrongs

  in that selfsame spirit he poured out
the tale he had fabricated when he
had finished his story his questioner arose
without a word walked to a wall pressed
an unseen spring or button and dis-
appeared through a second sliding door in
the wall that closed behind him without
leaving the slightest trace of its ex-
istence

chapter v

a bargain is struck

for the better part of an hour
elton was left standing alone in the
dark room not a sound reached
his ears and in time the heavy silence the
gloomy uncertainty began to tug at his
nerves he remembered suddenly that
he had been allowed to keep his pistol
in his pocket he had two extra clips of 
caliber ammunition with which he filled
the half empty magazine of the weapon
the loaded gun gave him a sense of
security he took advantage of the
empty room to secrete the weapon in his
blouse handy to his reach no matter
what happened he would not be wholly
defenseless he assured himself

  his eyes fixed themselves in time on the
top of the deserted table he noted with
a flicker of interest that it was littered
with maps and papers across one
comer lay a canvas dispatch case bulging
with documents another dispatch case
was hung across the back of the chair
his interest quickened a glance at
those papers while the room was empty
of observers might yield invaluable in-
formation it might orient him against
his future course warn him of future
dangers but he discreetly put aside any
thought of crossing the room that slid-
ing door might admit some one at any
instant this was not a time for hasty
action he must play the game slowly
cautiously with every atom of his intelli-
gence keyed up to the highest pitch with
an iron hand at the control of his feelings
at every instant suiting action to
thought he lighted a cigaret seated him-
self on the stone floor with his hands rest-
ing between his knees and waited

  when the sliding door finally parted it
was to admit a different mn a man of
the same height as the one who had ad-
mitted elton though he was much
younger and seemed more alert the eyes
he fixed upon elton were those of dead
carp and his voice when he spoke was
low cold and expressionless

so you are an american officer the

man inquired no hint in his tone of the
startling import carried by his words

  elton had refuge in the role of private
strothers

i was a non-com he replied evenly
they busted me for no reason at all
thats what started my run of hard luck
there was an almost imperceptible glint
in the dead eyes

  so you americans are taking up where
the french secret police left off he
leered at elton did you fancy you
would fool any one

  you mean- eltons eyes distended
at the thrust and a gleam of fear flashed
momentarily he covered instantly
you mean youre going to turn me over
to the police he demanded

  his hand rose to his unbuttoned blouse
the tips of his fingers caressing the butt of
his army automatic

  a clever rogue on my word com-
mented the other or else a very valu-
able acquisition my intuitions warn me
against you-but im going to make
sure

  elton glowered back

  i cant see where anybody ought to
cut in he said if youre so afraid i
might get you in bad with the americans
just let me stay here till night and ill
make my getaway i got my months
pay left-and ill turn it over if thatll
help any

  either you are or you arent what you
seem to be commented the other coldly
if you are-excellent for all concerned
if you arent- the veriest flicker of a
smile passed over the lean face in any
event ill establish the facts for myself
you need say nothing more bon jour
my friend and in the meantime you will
not want for necessary comforts

  he turned on his heel without haste and
strolled from the room the unseen door
sliding aside for him as if by magic as
he approached the door closed then
opened at once to admit a fat dumpy man
with an egg shaped bald head who carried
an ordinary army cot and several olive
drab american blankets folded under one
arm while with his other hand he held
the spy trap



a steaming tray of food these things he
placed in the center of the room and left
without so much as a glance at elton

  thereafter the minutes lengthened into
hours unendurable hours of tormenting
silence elton maintained his wakeful-
ness until his wrist watch told the hour of
midnight when he turned in for sleep
when he awakened from a fitful doze it
was seven oclock of the next morning
while he slept his breakfast had been
brought in to him together with a pack-
age of cigarets when he had finished his
tepid coffee he took one of his strange
hosts cigarets

the length and elegance
of it attracted his attention
together with a vague and
pleasing perfume it was no
ordinary french cigaret nor was it of
american manufacture he struck a
match to light it and under the flame his
eye caught a small figure in gold on the
side of the cylinder he took it from his
mouth in curiosity and as he did so he
started the figure was a coronet and
under it in graceful gold script the
letter v superimposed upon the letter
s-von strindheim

  there was a slight tremor in eltons
hand as he struck another match the
hand was steady again as he raised the
light to his cigaret and puffed at it with
seeming tranquillity his face was a mask
as he lay down on the army cot and
smoked luxuriously but inwardly his
pulse was racing feverishly von strind-
hcims monogrammed cigaret what
whim of vanity what secret import lay
behind the germans action in sending in
his own private stock

  who unless it was von strindheim in
the flesh would resort to such subtlety
he remembered colonel ourqs insistence
that the baron lived-even though he had
been a witness at the prussian espions
execution and the incident of the
monogrammed cigaret was more eloquent
of the barons existence than ourqs stout
if slightly apologetic insistence cer-
tainly elton reasoned a mere masquer-

ader would not indulge in such vanities
in so subtle a warning to a mere suspect
that it was the baron with whom he must
deal

  hours of the suffocating silence ticked
by hours in which elton was assailed by
gnawing uncertainties the fear that he
might have been sealed in the room to die
for want of air dissolved when he found
that the little chamber was ventilated by
hidden vents

  there was no doubt then that he was
being held while his story was investi-
gated and he found a grain of comfort
in the thought that he had made his ap-
proach with painstaking thoroughness
his striking of the lieutenant his trial by
court-he alone knew the truth behind
these incidents they would stand the
test of investigation only the incident
of taking refuge in this place would arouse
suspicion but would not that suspicion
he asked himself be erased when the
steps by which he became a prisoner were
investigated

  certainly the spy at orly would give
him a clearance for it was impossible
that the german operative there masquer-
ading in american uniform had failed
to learn all the details of his rumpus
doubtless he was an eyewitness of the
drubbing administered to the squadron
adjutant

  the long hours of wracking inaction and
silence turned his mind again to the table
with its piles of papers as he set to
pacing the floor the lure of those papers
became almost irresistible once he
hesitated-all but stopped before the
table but then he remembered that
his role was that of private strothers
and private strothers hounded fugitive
would have small interest in a mere pile
of documents

  promptly at noon with true german
punctiliousness the dumpy old menial
came through the wall with luncheon
hard on the heels of the flunkey appeared
another figure-a slight erect faultlessly
groomed man of early middle age in
french civilian dress

  you have fared in some comfort i


ared white

trust the fellow greeted elton in a polite
formal voice

  thanks said elton its been great
to have a safe place to hide out in away
from those wolves im obliged to you
gentlemen

the newcomer had a
chair brought in seated himself
and bade elton proceed with
his luncheon he sat observing
the american in a casual sort of way
from his moments survey of the man
elton concluded that he must be a per-
sonage of secondary importance although
without doubt one of the kaisers trained
operatives his face was that of an upper
officer-caste frenchman strong clear fea-
tures shrewd gray eyes small waxed
black mustache that heightened the pallor
of his pale skin as of one who has been
little in the open with troops one
characteristic caught eltons attention
later the fellows heavy arched eye-
brows occasionally moved up and down
in a way suggestive of a tic or nervous
ailment

  your story checks out fairly well my
friend the visitor announced presently

  elton looked up anxiously

  will you tell me whats in the air what
chance i got of a getaway-just where i
stand he demanded

  certainly said the operative we
can afford to be very frank with you
first may i ask if you have regretted your
rash action in any way has it occurred
to you that perhaps you would fare a great
deal better by surrendering yourself to
the american military police

  never elton spat the word id
rather die than put in a quarter of a
century behind the bars a rotten deal
i got

  you are very optimisti my friend
said the other in your assumption that
the americans would hold you in jail i
presume you realize that the new charge
against you is one that is dealt with
summarily

  what do you mean

  i mean that you are wanted for

murder-and you know the penalty for
that offense

  murder elton was genuinely star-
tled by this play i beat up on a lieu-
tenant but i didnt murder him

  but you shot two of the soldiers who
tried to capture you-killed one outright
and a second died later of a pistol wound
elton jumped up and paced the floor in
simulated agitation his mind had pene-
trated the subterfuge instantly that he
had fired well over the heads of his pur-
suers he was certain therefore the fel-
lows purpose in charging him with
murder was all too clear

  well what are you going to do about
it he demanded returning to his seat
and staring resolutely at the espion

  that depends on how well you are
willing to pay us for our pains the other
said

  you can have all i got pleaded
elton it isnt much but ill turn it
over

  i wasnt talking in terms of money
the fellow smiled insinuatingly i
meant in service

  if theres anything i can do- tell
me what you want

  the german operativ e lighted a cigaret
an ordinary french cigaret and subjected
elton to a further contemplative study

  first kindly turn over to me your
weapon he directed

  why-why is that necessary eltons
reluctance in disarming himself was real
the presence of the pistol under his coat
was a grim comfort which he hesitated to
relinquish

  if we do not help you of what value
is a pistol or a hundred pistols against
the vengeance of the american military
police the spy reasoned shrewdly

  i reckon thats right too elton re-
sponded glumly he drew forth the
automatic and gave it over

  as i said the prussian agent pro-
ceeded promptly slipping the pistol into
his coat pocket we can afford to be
very frank with you-under the circum-
stances we are not conducting either
a charitable institution or a refuge for
the spy trap



fugitive americans every one here
works and works hard your job will be
that of a motorcycle courier running be-
tween paris and beifort-a work of the
greatest importance if you elect to under-
take it

  but how am i going to run around out
in the open with them after me for
murder elton demanded

  that has been thought of my friend
the americans thanks to our efforts be-
lieve you were drowned the other day
while trying to swim down the seine no
one looks for a dead man with very
slight disguise and with an american uni-
form and m p brassard on your arm the
dumb americans would not stop you in a
hundred years i might add that you will
be richly paid for your services you will
have the cooperation and aid of an ex-
tensive organization and a future after
the war which is going to end some time
during july following our capture of
paris

  you mean for me to-to carry spy
messages is that what youre driving
at elton was on his feet again and
staring wildly at his host

in the service of his im-
perial majesty the king of
prussia said the other in an
even collected voice he arose
and turned away pausing at the secret
door as it opened for him a much
safer occupation than dodging murder
charges he added you may think it
over and give me your answer at your
convenience unless you wish to enter
upon your work in the proper spirit we
have no desire to force you its entirely
up to you

  eltons voice halted him as he was pass-
ing out of the room

  ill tell you now he said in a low
vibrant voice im wise enough to see
theres nothing else i can do i got myself
to think about and-while i never
thought much of the kaisers gang-i
cant see where i got any more call to love
a gang that hasnt got anything better
for me than a-a rope

  i had counted upon your intelligence
smiled the espion he consulted his watch
and his eyebrows twitched nervously
it is nearly one oclock we will discuss
the further details of your work a bit
later for the present i am occupied with
another matter-of small importance it
is possible that i will let you observe the
details as your first lesson it may
establish your faith in the exceptional in-
tellect under whose guidance you will
operate hereafter

  you mean-the kaiser elton asked
i mean his excellency the haupt-
mann baron erich wolf von strind-
heim responded the other he turned
to the wall and a moment later the mas-
sive sliding door closed upon him

chapter vi

the apache failure

while the visitor had taken away
the comfort afforded by an auto-
matic pistol he left elton the
solace of a morning paper with which to
relieve the monotony of the wait elton
turned to the newspaper eagerly not that
he was in any humor for reading but be-
cause it gave him an appearance of occu-
pation while he analyzed the develop-
ments of the day and reckoned his
future course a courier to the swiss
border a remarkable stroke of luck he
thought it would give him the routes of
the important german intelligence re-
ports it would give him a chance at
their ciphers and codes it might give
him his opportunity to trap the great spy
nest of which he was now about to be-
come a part

  when he had made his conclusions he
turned his mind to the printed columns
although he read french with difficulty
he was able tr glean the news of the day
battle news a resume of the economic
situation in france lists of officer
casualties a not too cheerful estimate of
american strength and participation that
could be depended upon during 
hints of an impending german drive


ared white

described as the most powerful the
central powers had yet launched near
the bottom of a column devoted to edi-
torial comment he came upon an article
by the editor which he read with a grow-
ing amazement he read it a second and
third time in the thought that perhaps his
translation had been faulty

  under the startling caption shall
we let the world bleed to death the
editor demanded whether the slaughter
must go on until civilization had de-
stroyed itself was there not some way
out some honorable way in which the
french leaders could initiate negotia-
tions or must the red orgy go on and on
until there was black crape dangling from
every door in france

  he turned to the front page again and
glanced at the heading le journal a
powerful newspaper of paris often spoken
of as the mouthpiece of the french masses
what could it mean elton remembered
that french morale had been low for
months but did this mean that it was
breaking a daring editorial of far
reaching consequences and if it reflected
an existing weakness in france or crys-
tallized such a weakness in the popular
mind would france be able to survive a
smashing german drive on paris such as
had been hovering in the north like an
ominous black specter

his reflections were
interrupted by a voice he
looked up to see still another
man a slightly older man than
the preceding visitor but of like build
with the exception of the shoulders which
sloped almost to the point of deformity
the face struck him with the force of a
blow a sinister face warped in feature
cold merciless cruel its lines were sharp
lines-a black bristling brow that covered
eyes which glinted through mere slits
the nose was long sharp and twisted at
the bridge the mouth an abrupt blue
lipped line that broke sharply downward
at the corners

  i am directed monsieur to request
your presence in another room he an-

nounced in avoice that was as hard and
metallic as his face we are preparing
to receive a distinguished visitor in this
chamber

  elton followed him without reply
through the secret door and found him
self in a narrow stone hallway as barren
and bleak as the chamber in which he had
been held on probation they proceeded
a short distance along the hallway until
its wall opened to admit them through
another secret door into a small room
as he entered elton saw that it was more
than an underground hole the floor was
carpeted there were several comfortable
chairs a large writing desk of circassian
walnut and the place seemed well venti-
lated although no vents were visible
from the ceiling was suspended a long
cylindrical tube the size of a stovepipe
which broke four feet above the floor into
a square projection and which elton
immediately recognized as a periscope or
trench-scope of special construction

  we are about to receive a distin-
guished visitor the german said speak-
ing the same excellent english as his
predecessors

  one of our own workers you mean
elton inquired

  no a french person the other
answered he arrived some hours be-
fore in the excellent cafe of monsier du
puy above us which you have such good
cause to remember even now he is in
monsieurs unpleasant wine cellar his
heart filled with vengeance against the
french secret police ready to join forces
with us

  are you sure you-we-can trust
him elton demanded he registered
dire alarm mighnt he be somebody the
americans are sending down here on my
trail

  he is pierre dubonnet a french
apache who has escaped the conscription
and has a price on his head for a series of
villainous murders my friend his story
is most plausible-and we can trust him
implicitly the fellow smiled cynically
we can always trust french stupidity in
matters of this kind especially when we
the spy trap



know the mans real name and mission
days before he comes to us

  youre talking over my head elton
persisted you mean he isnt pierre an
apache with a knife out for his own
people

  i mean that he is really the lieutenant
paul marie destainnez agent no 
of the french department of military
intelligence sent here by colonel ourq to
outwit the imperial german military in-
telligence service you shall observe
presently how well he succeeds clever
and painstaking rogue though he is

  a faint buzzing barely audible
sounded in the room the german agent
drew his chair close to the periscope and
fixed his eyes to the mirrored aperture at
its base for some moments he gazed in
silence then sat back and motioned elton
to move his chair up and observe

  our frenchman is arriving this mo-
ment he said make haste if you wish
to see the spectacle in its entirety

       the chamber from which
he had so recently departed
was as clear to elton through
the scope as if he had been
looking in through a clear window the
frenchman was inside now the secret
door closing behind him the pudgy little
german attendant motioning him to a
chair the german menial whose func-
tions elton now guessed to be that of
manipulator of the secret doors and
flunkey of all work retired from the
room at once reappeared a moment later
with a bottle of wine and withdrew a
second time leaving the frenchman
alone

  the french operative was effectively
disguised as an apache he too must
have resorted to time and pains in prepa-
ration for the desperate adventure on
his face was a stubbly weeks growth of
hair his face was grimy his eyes
dissipated and bloodshot his clothes little
better than filthy rags his black hair
was tangled and matted under a greasy
cap elton saw that the courageous
french agent had not depended upon

paint or makeup but must have lived
among the apaches as a background for
his invasion of the secret german haunts

  there followed a long period in which
the frenchman merely sat in the room
alone he carried out his role as an
apache with the skill of an actor looking
about him with furtive ratlike glances
scratching himself frequently and vigor-
ously in the manner of one who is vermin
infested and smoking one black french
cigaret after another elton felt pity for
the man as he sat looking at him be-
trayed before his arrival    without
the slightest chance of escape from that
stone hole doomed to certain death
the mysterious death that already had
claimed one by one those fifty of his
comrades who had preceded him in the
mad venture

  again elton thanked his own prudence
in having left colonel ourq in darkness
of his plans for there could be no doubt
now of one thing the germans had
representation in the french secret ser-
vice small wonder the flower of the
french military operatives had failed to
return from the chase

  you need not wear out your eyes use-
lessly the german interrupted him
after a time other eyes will warn us
when there is anything of interest for us
to observe

  you are going to kill him elton
asked bluntly his voice was hollow and
sprained in spite of his effort at sang-
froid

  on the contrary said the other
his excellency would not permit such a
thing as that it would be so-so un-
necessary

  but didnt you say he was a french
secret service spy-come here to get us
do you let that kind go when you catch
them

  the germans thin blue lips curled
over stained teeth

  it is much simpler he said to give
them the rope and let them hang them-
selves in their own way it is a more
fitting reward for treachery as you shall
see very clearly in so short a time


ared white

  they sat in silence a long time the
german nonchalantly lighted a large
elaborately carved briar pipe and buried
himself in a book leaving elton to his
own devices and thoughts there were
other books on the table but elton re-
frained from taking one interest in a
book at such a time would not fit in with
the role of private strothers he sat
slumped in his chair his heart depressed
and heavy at the tragic fate he was
certain awaited his helpless ally in the
other room a fate that might have been
his except for his prudence in guarding
against betrayal as he waited he
smoked one cigaret after another not as
a gesture but to relieve the tension of his
nerves

  the buzzer rang again a faint burring
sound but now having the venomous
malignance of a coiled rattlers warning
elton started the german operative
laid his book aside with an indolent
movement moved his chair back to the
periscope and motioned elton up again

the frenchman elton
saw was now pacing the floor
restlessly his gait no longer
was the slinking movement of
an apache renegade but the stride of a
soldier his head was up and his eyes
were fixed upon the table as he walked
the table whose top was littered with
papers and dispatch cases each time he
approached the table he paused to look
about the chamber with alert searching
eyes to convince himself that he was not
observed

  a guttural exclamation came from the
german an inarticulate sound of abiding
satisfaction as the frenchman stood
furtively over the table

  the dunce he said in another mo-
ment he shall usher himself into hell by
his own treacherous hands

  as the frenchman reached down to the
papers on the table elton was swept by
an impulse to cry out in warning he
felt that the frenchmans move would
prove the signal for whatever dire re-
prisal the kaisers agents intended for the

doomed operative but as the officer
ran deftly through the papers nothing
happened he paused at a large sheet of
paper and read it with eyes that became
distended whatever information he got
from the document encouraged him to
continue his search avidly and yet with a
trained operatives care

  when he had finished his examination
of the papers on the table the frenchman
gingerly took up the dispatch cases one
by one and with his eye alternating be-
tween the secret door and the papers
began going over them one at a time

  it is over my friend the german
announced laconically there is noth-
ing more of interest

  elton saw with astonishment that the
german had moved back from the scope
and was buried in his book the fellow
glanced up as he felt eltons eyes upon
him and spoke casually without emotion

  i would not turn away my friend
he said perhaps what is yet to come
might amuse you-though to me such
sights have become commonplace and
distasteful he suppressed a yawn as he
returned to his book

  his eyes glued back to the periscope
elton saw that the strange scene was
unchanged except that the frenchman
had drawn his revolver and held it under
the crook of his left arm ready for the
grip of his right hand in event of surprise
he continued to explore the dispatch
cases document by document with a
quickening of interest a relaxation of his
alertness evidently convinced that the
information he gleaned was worth the
risk of his life was more urgently valuable
than the spy nest itself

  why was he permitted to continue his
exploration elton asked himself were
the germans merely toying with him as a
cat plays with a helpless mouse would
an unseen hand finally send a bullet
crashing into the frenchmans heart or
spring a hidden trap to plunge him into
an underground cavern

  even as elton asked himself these
questions his nerves on edge sickened by
his own utter helplessness to intervene
the spy trap



the answer began to unfold itself the
frenchman paused a sheet of paper in his
hand and looked about the room in the
startled way of a wild animal that has
sensed danger in another instant he
had cast the document aside and retreated
across the room a look of terror mounting
to his face

  whatever omen had reached his mind
confirmed itself swiftly he began mov-
ing around the chamber frantically ex-
amining the walls for a rift in the trap
but unlike a trapped animal when he
found there was no hope of escape he
pulled himself together and calmly re-
turned to the table there to seat himself
and resume the reading of the german
papers

  the labored heaving of the french
officers chest the greenish pallor that
spread over his features in the passage of
a minute betrayed to elton the tragedy
that was being enacted before his eyes
it was gas in a now airtight chamber that
was sapping the victims life gas from
unseen jets that the frenchman himself
had opened by the very act of lifting a
dispatch case his own official curiosity
had been the means of his wretched end

with magnificent courage
the frenchman awaited death
now that the trap was dis-
closed to him he must have
sensed that relentless enemy eyes ob-
served his cruel ordeal his face became
placid undisturbed unafraid the face
of a brave man meeting a firing squad
in the line of duty his head nodded

  the gas was robbing him slowly of
consciousness very shortly he would
pass into the sleep from which there
would be no awakening as he nodded a
second time and a third he shook himself
fought off the icy fingers of death that
were clutching his throat and got to
his feet painfully he forced his swaying
body into the stiff erectness of a soldier
at attention and raised his hand to the
vizor of his grimy apache cap in salute

  vive la france

  elton choked back a sob and closed his

eyes not daring at the moment to expose
his face lest his emotion betray him to the
german agents gaze when he could
trust himself he moved back his chair

   it is over he said his voice low and
 unnatural a word of tribute to the
 gallant frenchman rose to his lips he
 died like a man-magnificently

  they usually do responded the
espion placidly he laid his book aside
and sat up in his chair but no more
magnificently than our own von strind-
heim died under the blade of their guillo-
tine

  but i thought- even the tragedy
was swept aside for the moment by this
amazing statement-i thought you said
it was the baron-von strindheim-who
is-is the one we look to for orders
elton stammered

   quite right my friend responded
the german enigmatically his excel-
lencys one difficulty is to convince the
french that he lives today and quite a
load it is upon their credence since they
saw his head fall into their basket

   but you said he died magnificently
 indeed yes it was sublime incom-
 parable the end of a true prussian ex-
 cept of course that the heads of really
 capable gentlemen do not really fall into
 any ones basket and now that the ruse
 has served its purpose his excellency finds
 it stupid to be thought dead a game too
 one sided for his liking he feels that
 such security might dull the edges of his
 intellect if permitted to continue you
 will understand these things the more
 clearly when you have observed the
 hauptmann baron with your own eyes
 then the baron really is here-and
 i am to see him for myself

   frequently no doubt since you are
entering our service the baron will want
to observe you in many ways of his own
choosing it will remain for you to iden-
tify him for yourself when he is present
but in the meantime i am instructed to
present you to the lieutenant von hint-
zen the chief of staff to his excellency
who is to set you about your duties at
once

chapter vii	

to the frontier   

  at the end of a network of dark
walled-in hallways elton was left
standing alone while his escort
disappeared through another sliding door
his wait was very brief this time the
wall opened a voice bade him enter and
he found himself facing still another oper-
ative alone in a large room of stone but
luxuriously furnished

   the man sat at a large desk of elabo-
rately carved teak in an immense oriental
chair of the same material he motioned
elton to a chair and sat without speaking
until the fat man-of-all-work appeared
from nowhere bearing a silver champagne
bucket with a bottle of select wine packed
in ice elton saw that he now dealt with
a personage a quite different sort from
the ones who had previously engaged him
although oddly enough he was of the
same slight build and his physique was
that of the others except for square well
set shoulders his face was keen aqui-
line and with an unmistakable arrogance
in the set of the finely molded mouth and
the half closed indolent eyes

  you have been told of me he said
his voice mellow friendly but self-
contained von hintzen the one who
looks after details here for his excellency
the hauptmann baron erich wolf von
strindheim you are the american who
is willing to serve us as courier between
paris and belfort on reflection do you
find your situation to your liking

  why not responded elton vith a
shrug of hopelessness i am not in very
good shape to pick my work this is the
only thing that gives me anything to look
to except a few feet of american hemp
with a scaffold on one end and me on the
other

  neatly said exclaimed von hint-
zen a whimsical smile flitting across his
passive face there was an indefinable
insinuation in his voice as he added
you may be assured that his excellency
will see to it that you are appropriately
rewarded for your efforts regardless of

what reward your operations shall merit

  he opened the champagne with his own
hand and filled two glasses passing one
to elton

  a bit of wine after your observations
this afternoon which must have been
rather unpleasant he proposed and
since we drink-a toast to his imperial
majesty wilhelm king of prussia
von hintzen stood at this and drank
snapping the shank of his glass as he
drained it

  elton followed his example von hint-
zen puzzled him the succeeding line of
interrogators puzzled him each with his
exact knowledge of what had transpired
before the enigma of von hintzen was
heightened by the magnificence of the
room in which he was quartered the full
richness of its appointments catching
eltons eye as he looked boldly about
him

  it must have been thirty feet in length
and perhaps twenty-four feet across on
the stone floor was a rich persian rug of
the finest weave tapestries worth a
small fortune hung from the walls while
the chairs and trappings were suitable
for an imperial lounge there was in the
air instead of the damp smell of stone a
faint pleasing odor of a rare incense that
burned from unseen lamps

  one curious detail that attracted him
was the array of flowers flowers of vari-
ous species literally flooded the room
there were beautiful glass and silver
vases of them on the desk on small tables
over the room flowers festooned along the
walls arranged on the floor strangely
they were not of the choicest a few
bunches of roses were outnumbered by
large arrays of ordinary daisies common
dog fennel poppies-flowers of the french
fields

even as elton was wondering
at von hintzens queer pen-
chant the menial came through
the door bearing a pasteboard
box which he delivered to the prussian
von hintzen opened the parcel-a large
bouquet of fennel-upon which his eyes
the spy trap



beamed with satisfaction as he arranged
it carefully in a silver bowl on his desk
except for the flowers a gold inkwell
pen pencils and a small pad of paper the
top of the desk was bare no papers no
documents no maps appeared

  you were impressed my friend
von hintzen proceeded with the-ah-
most unfortunate death of the gallant
frenchman a few moments ago in fact
i might say your sympathies were deeply
stirred

  i never saw a man die quite like that
elton parried it upset me a bit for
sure i didnt think the french were
quite-quite like that

  you might have felt differently said
von hintzen had you seen the french
blade descend upon the head of a gallant
german soldier not so long ago there
was both pride and bitterness in the
germans voice think of the sublime
courage of an ordinary fellow a mere com-
mon under officer of the prussian guards
who laughs at the french kiss of death
as they call their wretched guillotine who
dies like a rat to fill a nameless grave-in
the service of the fatherland

  i was just told it was the baron him-
self who was sentenced to the knife
elton ventured intent on learning at last
the evasive details of von strindheims
mysterious escape

  von hintzen sneered

  the stupid french intelligence was
certain of it they lacked the imagina-
tion the thoroughness to suspect the
truth nor are they capable of believing
it now with the evidence before their
eyes in reality the man whose life they
took was feldwebel hans schwarz a man
of his excellencys former regiment a
man devotedly attached to the haupt-
mann baron erich wolf von strindheim
and who bore only a passing resemblance
to the baron yet how they prated and
strutted over their feat of trapping his
excellency

  the lieutenant lighted a brown pana-
tella cigar and puffed reflectively his
eyes half closed but elton saw that the
eyes under the drooping lids burned with

a covert alertness that observed every
movement of his american hostages eyes
and face

  i do not hesitate to tell you all the
officer went on german thoroughness
foresees events by many years a gentle-
man of his excellencys talent leaves little
to chance since he foresaw that one day
the french intelligence service would
want the baron in their clutches he es-
tablished the feldwebel in that role
while he worked on unknown you can
see my friend what happened they
merely arrested the man they knew as
his excellency tried him executed him
and congratulated themselves upon their
cleverness yet the fine part of it all as
i have said was the magnificence in which
the feldwebel sacrificed himself but his
grave shall not be nameless afready his
imperial majesty has conferred upon
feldwebel schwarz the order of the iron
cross-and at the proper time a bronze
memorial shall be placed in koln to the
brave fellows memory i cite these facts
merely that you may realize the clever-
ness and the courage of the prussian
arms-the immutable fact that we are
destined to triumph

  as he heard the mystery of von strind-
heims reappearance on earth thus ex-
plained elton controlled his surprise
clinging to the thought of his role to the
mental attitude of private strothers lest
those boring eyes penetrate his sham
he offered no comment and the prussian
did not invite his opinion

  but i have a mission for you- the
lieutenant changed the subject i am
sending you immediately to belfort on a
journey one of sentiment which involves
no risk are you prepared to assume
your duties immediately

  is there not the risk that i will be
picked up by the american military po-
lice the minute i show myself elton
asked shifting nervously in his chair

  a risk to be certain said von hint-
zen abruptly he added with a disagree-
able emphasis but hardly any such risk
as that taken by the gallant frenchman
whom you admired so deeply-nor by


ared white

our own feldwebel schwarz in fact
you will face little risk at all although it
is not possible my friend to have a part
in a great war without taking some
chances well furnish you with a most
effective disguise and you will have the
support of his excellency at every turn
well im not afraid of a little risk
retorted elton but i never tried a
disguise it always seemed to me like a
disguise was sure to attract more people
than it would fool

  a clumsy disguise yes but we will
send you in the uniform of a military
police lieutenant of the american army
the m p brassard will take you past the
american apd french barriers without
the least question-thanks to their stupid
inefficiency

  im ready then elton asserted
but i do wish there was something i
could do besides spy work

  von hintzens thin mouth stiffened

  i do not like that term he snapped
you are working for an important and
highly honorable branch of the military
service as a part of the most useful body
in france spy is a poor word one i
detest besides on your first trip i am
requiring you to do nothing more than
deliver some flowers to a lady in belfort
who is ill-a very dear friend of his
excellency

  well you got my word that ill go
through-and that stands elton af-
firmed

  one last word the officer leaned
across the table and spoke through com-
pressed lips if you attempt treachery-
well you have seen what happens
his excellency has the resources to fol-
low you to the ends of the earth treach-
ery will never be forgiven any man this
side of hell i do not mind telling you
that his excellency is suspicious of you
his intuitions warn him to have nothing
to do with you but-a misfortune in the
vosges mountains closed our communica-
tions there a short time since-and we
need the services of an american courier
to belfort

  the fellow sat back in his chair and

relaxed he regarded elton for a time
with a hint of ironical amusement

  if you will pardon my frankness he
said his excellency insists that you are
an exceptionally clever rogue here for no
good purpose there are two reasons
why we are discounting the hauptmann
baron erichs thought first we run no
risk since you are the one who will suffer
in event of treachery second his excel-
lency admits he may be mistaken since
you are an-an american-and there-
fore not one to cause us much concern in
event of treachery americans under-
stand me are not stupid folks-merely
primitive and rather simple

  im going to do my best to make good
on the job elton averred the others
subtle affront to his nationality seeming
to be lost upon him

  in event you win his excellencys
favor said von hintzen you will be an
exceedingly fortunate and favored man
but come-it is time that you must be
on your way to belfort

       von hintzen himself su-
pervised eltons departure on
his initial mission in the em-
perors service first he fitted
him with an olive drab uniform of ap-
proved weave and cut the coat of fine
serge the breeches of bedford cord
cordovan puttees and sam browne belt
cap of latest american design collar orna-
ments an m p arm brassard every de-
tail complete the prussian with a few
deft touches of razor and pencil changed
the shape of eltons eyebrows and with
clippers he close cropped his shock of
blond hair

  odd as it may seem the german
commented as he surveyed his handiwork
you could pass through your own com-
pany without being recognized the
secret of a disguise is to use skill in the
details and make it very simple a
change of posture serves much better
than four feet of false hair you must
remember to stand very straight and
keep your shoulders well back which is
not your natural way of standing
the spy trap



  disguise completed von hintzen ini-
tiated his new secret courier into the
mystery of entering and leaving the un-
derground rendezvous eltons amaze-
ment grew as he saw the intricate under-
ground devices that hemmed in german
espionage years of guarded work by
trusted workmen before the war storm
broke must have gone into the develop-
ment of this spy nest from which the re-
sourceful baron directed his minions an
impregnable fortress of steel would have
been far less secure against french assault
although he was admitted for the present
into the secrets of but one means of
egress elton saw clearly the impossibility
of taking the trap by force-at least with-
out allowing its denizens ample time in
which to escape to another prepared
rendezvous

  after traversing a network of walled-in
corridors with innumerable twists and
sharp turns von hintzen led the way
through a sliding trap in the floor to a
second underground labyrinth set some
twenty feet below the first a tangled
network of halls ended in a gloomy bare
chamber some twenty feet square in
which there was no indication of door or
window

  this the prussian tersely explained
was the point of departure and entrance
which elton would use on leaving the
room he would find himself in a subway
station he would board the train for
avenue de la montrez get off at that
stop make his presence known to a taxi
driver whose vehicle would be waiting for
him in the street and proceed to the point
where a sidecar motorcycle would be
waiting von hintzen gave him minute
instructions on the route to be followed
in traveling to belfort his movements
upon arrival there the secret means of
regaining admittance to the rendezvous
when he returned

  and now my friend you will deliver
these flowers to mile dupre at number
 of the rue aignan said von
hintzen he handed elton a large bou-
quet of ordinary dog fennel the stems
bound together with wire his excel-

lency sends no dispatches merely this
token of his solicitation for mademoiselles
good health you will carry them in your
musette bag

  it is only fair for me to know said
elton if they carry hidden papers in
event i am stopped-

  have no uneasiness on account of the
flowers my friend von hintzen re-
assured him it would not matter in the
least to us if they fell into the hands of the
french secret service nor will you be
called upon to carry secret documents
back with you when you return from bel-
fort although if mademoiselle should
send some token to his excellency deliver
it into my hands and no other and now
adieu herr strothers and bon voyage

  without further ado the prussian es-
corted elton to a corner of the chamber
placed him close against the wall and
then disappeared back into the secret
labyrinth a small opening appeared in
the wall its mechanism controlled from
overhead by a lookout who saw when the
coast was clear elton found himself de-
livered into an obscure corner of a parisian
subway station a gendarme stood near-
by but paid no attention to the american
upon whose arm appeared the unques-
tioned passport of an m p brassard
something about the gendarme stirred
elton but he put it down to nervousness
and hurried into the crowd to await his
train

  it was a tedious ride in the stuffy slow
moving french subway to avenue de la
montrez where he got out he caught
his breath at sight of the identical gen-
darme leaving the car immediately ahead
of him but the officer disappeared in the
crowd without a glance in eltons direc-
tion and while he put the circumstance
down to coincidence nevertheless elton
proceeded by a circuitous route to the
awaiting taxicab the driver acknowl-
edged the secret sign of recognition-a
covert movement of the hands-admitted
elton to the cab and drove off at high
speed turning and weaving in and out
among obscure narrow streets for more
than an hour before he brought up in an


ared white

alleyway in the outskirts of the city
where an army motorcycle with sidecar
awaited

chapter viii

fennel and photos

the sun was low in the west as
elton sped through the suburbs of
paris and flashed into the smooth
country road that led through provins
and on in the direction of belfort the
rush of the balmy june air in his face
stimulated his jaded mind after the long
confinement in the stuffy underworld of
paris when he was well past provins
he slowed down the better to reflect upon
the developments upon the hidden pur-
pose that was behind his present mis-
sion to the french border city

  even though he had penetrated the
prussian spy nest in paris had even been
accepted as a secret courier what hope
offered itself that he would be able to
capture von strindheim and his spy clan
a feeling akin to despair gripped him as
he reflected upon the difficulty that beset
his course the mystery of the spy chief-
tains underground citadel and of von
strindheims escape from the guillotine
had dissolved into simple explanation
but he had seen piled up the evidence
of von strindheims resourcefulness the
devilish ingenuity in which the prussian
entrenched himself in the very heart of
paris even if he brought a whole french
sapper regiment to bear on the place
surrounding it with armed men and tun-
neling into its underground network his
coup would avail him nothing better than
an empty trap and as for ensnaring the
brains of the crew von strindheim him-
self-elton remembered that he had not
been permitted so much as a fleeting
glimpse at the rascal nor the slightest
clew to his habits of coming and going

  if he had hope that the flowers which
he carried to belfort might yield some
light elton found himself baffled again
when he halted in a deserted hedge along
the highway and examined the bouquet

much to his surprise he found there was
no secret message concealed in flowers or
stems why he demanded of himself at
this disclosure was he rushing across the
face of france carrying a bunch of stale
dog fennel had the baron sent roses
it might have hinted at amour surely dog
fennel was an odd medium by which to
express tender sentiments to a lady it
must be he concluded finally that this
journey was a test a part of his proba-
tion perhaps a stall for time while his
antecedents were more closely investi-
gated by the baron for the present
then there was nothing to do but follow
his instructions faithfully and await the
budding of future developments

  belfort and his brief visit to the
chateau of mile dupre in the environs of
the border city merely added depth to the
enigma of his present journey it was
shortly after midnight when he ferreted
out the chateau an elegant country es-
tate two kilometers from the city in the
direction of the swiss frontier there
were no lights showing in the place but
his arrival must have been expected since
a cow faced domestic responded promptly
to his knock and after acknowledging the
von strindheim pass-sign escorted him
into a bed chamber on the floor above and
to the rear of the imposing residence
there he found a gray haired woman
pale wasted and seemingly very ill who
might have been of either french or ger-
man lineage though he guessed she came
from that racial blend common to the
region of alsace-lorraine

  i am instructed said elton without
formality to deliver to mile dupre
these flowers sent from paris by a devoted
friend

  i am mile dupre said the woman in
a low weak voice taking the flowers her
eyes lighting upon them as if they had
been orchids i am very grateful for
them she looked at them caressingly
for a moment and laid them beside her
pillow and when does monsieur return
to paris she inquired

  immediately mademoiselle said el-
ton such are my instructions-to re-
the spy trap



port back by sixteen of the clock which
means i have little time to lose

  will you be so generous as to deliver
this photograph she asked from
under her pillow she drew a large mounted
picture of a group of soldiers i am very
grateful to you she added may the
lord protect you and deliver you safely
back in paris this poor token may
prove a great solace to his excellency
bon voyage monsieur

out on the highway again
elton rode like the wind the
photograph stung him with
impatience impatience to ex-
amine its details yet caution prompted
him to put belfort far behind him before
pausing to look at the picture that it
held the secret of his journey to belfort
seemed next to certain-a message of
some sort from imperial headquarters
to the baron at paris sent through the
medium of the invalids chateau which
probably was nothing more than a relay
station in the chain of spy communica-
tions

  he risked passing the french barrier
some ten kilometers out of belfort and
the american barrier at vesoul with the
photograph lying face downward in the
bottom of his sidecar attachment that
was safer he reasoned than secreting it
about his person if it was found he
could claim that he picked it up along the
roadside but neither the french nor
american sentinels detained him for
more than a moment passing him at
sight of the magical m p insignia at his
sleeve in a narrow hedge lined country
lane he turned off to park his motorcycle
in a thicket and thrust the photo under
the powerful rays of his headlight

  the picture disclosed no more than
had the pungent bouquet of dog fennel
study it as he might it revealed nothing
it was a group of british soldiers ar-
ranged in double rank and standing
at ease in lax military formation an
arrow penned at the top of the picture
pointed downward to one of the soldiers
a scrawny fellow who looked directly into

the lens of the camera a circle of ink
framed the soldiers head and underneath
was scrawled in english the legend our
beloved nephew on the reverse side
there were no markings no slightest hint
of pen dipped in invisible ink at the
end of a puzzled examination of every
detail of the photo elton could only con-
clude that the picture was as meaningless
or as inscrutable as the flowers he had
carried to mile dupre

  but lieutenant von hintzens eyes
quickened into a glow of satisfaction
when he received the photograph from
eltons hand that afternoon at the hour
of four the precise time set for eltons
readmittance to the underground laby-
rinth of von strindheim the lieutenant
himself was at the entrance chamber to
receive the american courier the lieu-
tenant neglected formality of any sort
as his eye fell upon the picture under
eltons arm and he fairly snatched it
away his eyes dancing hungrily as he
drank in its detail elton saw now that
it was no innocent photograph he had
brought from the chateau of mile dupre

  you have done very well the prus-
sian commented i trust you encoun-
tered no difficulty with the military bar-
riers along the highway he added
with a slightly disagreeable smile ameri-
cans are judged so primitive no one
suspects them and as for suspicion of their
own kind they are too simple what a
shame they have been lured into this
war on the side of the stupid allies
they shall learn their horrible error only
when it is too late to turn back

  the lieutenant paused to take a cigaret
from his jeweled gold case light it and
proffer one to   ton

  i might say  he added his eyes upon
the courier through a cloud of gray smoke
that his excellency is pleased with your
trip to belfort although i warn you that
he has not put aside his suspicion of you
tomorrow you go again to the frontier
and in the meantime you are free to rest
i will escort you to your quarters where
your wants will be amply cared for

  eltons quarters proved to be a com-


ajeted white

fortable chamber although without visi-
ble door or window when the secret
door closed upon him he found himself
as hopelessly imprisoned as if he had been
confined to the money vaylt of a great
bank the room was lighted with a single
incandescent and fresh air was pumped in
through hidden vents a bed an easy
lounging chair french newspapers and
several novels in english offered him their
comforts

  while he pretended to relax in the
pages of a newspaper his mind was active
with the incident of the photograph
von hintzens reaction to the picture
the prussians loss of his customary sang-
froid at sight of the photo revealed with
certainty that it was a document of im-
portance even though any hint of its
import had escaped eltons keen eyes
another circumstance had caught his
eye-the behavior of von hintzens
eyebrows when he received elton his
brows had moved rapidly up and down
a recurrence of the nervous twitch that
had afflicted the german agent who had
staged the french officers tragic death
inconsequential as that might seem he
listed it carefully in his mind for future
reference and observation a third cir-
cumstance had escaped him until this
moment as he lighted the cigaret von
hintzen had given him his eyes caught a
familiar mark on its wrapping was
stamped a coronet and underneath the
significant script letters vs another
cigaret from the private stock of von
strindheim

it was not until the prussian
was ready for elton to leave
for belfort the next afternoon
that he was permitted to leave
the sealed chamber to which his meals had
been brought him as usual by the dumpy
guardian of the secret doors he had used
the weary hours of confinement for a
minute analysis of every incident and
circumstance of his underworld adven-
ture that process cheered him little
for it gave him small hope of an early
success to his intricate mission at pres-

ent his est deductions were little more
than suspicions he admitted to himself
and out of it there loomed the gloomy
shadow of possible failure of being effec-
tually outwitted by the wily von strind-
heim of being used as a courier the while
his quarry laughed at him from cover
ready to spring the death trap at the very
first suspicion of treachery

  von hintzen again escorted him to the
outer chamber the prussian appeared in
high spirits he inquired solicitously
after eltons comfort and though elton
listened acutely for the slightest hint of
mockery in the others voice he could only
conclude that the prussians politeness
was genuine he seized the opportunity
for which he had been waiting to ask
the return of his pistol

  ah my friend said von hintzen
but a pistol is such a feeble weapon it
is so much more secure to depend upon
ones wits and besides his excellency
is opposed to violence of any kind it
is so-ah-messy and needless

  a good automatic might spell the
difference between reaching belfort or
not reaching it elton persisted stoutly
or i might conceivably be trailed to this
very place by the secret service

  the prussian laughed

  a pistol can not cope with an army
he replied if you shoot while on the
highway you are lost as for a weapon
here-it is so unnecessary i will show
you

  he stepped to a corner of the room and
pressed a hidden spring in the wall which
precipitated a section of the floor violently
downward

  even if the secret service should batter
their way inside he explained they
would merely find themselves plunged
into the great sewer under paris to make
their way to the seine as best they might
or if they escaped that what then
there are ample chambers in which they
would find themselves secured from
which they would never reappear

  but if they kept out of the secret
rooms elton said

  again the lieutenant laughed
the spy trap



  there is no chamber nor space in his
excellencys establishment that is not
a death chamber if need be for treach-
erous hands and they would die without
his excellencys intervention for as you
have seen his excellency is a gentleman
of great heart as well as great mind who
requires that those who must die do so
by their own hand but precious time
passes herr strothers we have im-
portant duties to occupy our time

  if he had expected to receive secret
documents on his second trip to belford
elton was deeply puzzled when the lieu-
tenant handed him nothing more than a
second cluster of dog fennel

  as i have explained said von hint-
zen noting the couriers surprise his
excellency is a kindly man and so long
as mademoiselle is ill at belfort he will
have her always in his thoughts the
instructions are precisely the same as
those you received before-and pray do
not risk yourself needlessly in delivering
them bon jour herr strothers do not
risk yourself to no purpose

  the same heavy jowled french taxi
driver awaited him when elton left the
subway train at avenue de la montrez
half an hour later he was whirling like
mad out of paris through provins driven
by a consuming impatience to find a safe
place in w hich to reckon with the mystery
that he was now certain lurked in that
knot of dog fennel there was no longer
any doubt that the flowers conveyed some
secret information into germany that
secret he must discover without further
delay

he cursed his stupidity of
the day before when he put
the barons bouquet to a second
search almost immediately
he detected a token that was unmistak-
able in its significance-a very slight
clipping of the ends of the petals with
this discovery he took up a study of each
flower taking pains not to disturb the
arrangement of the cluster nor to detach
a single petal

  this search yielded a further illuminat-

ing discovery the petals had been pared
in different lengths ranging from the
minutest fractions of an inch to perhaps
half an inch occasionally a petal or a
group of petils had been plucked out al-
together 

  an alphabet cipher message he told
himself a smile of satisfaction wreathed
his face even though von strindheim
was suspicious of him at least he would
hardly suspect that he might be dealing
with an expert in the breaking down of
secret ciphers

  a glance at his watch told elton that
he could spare two hours and yet reach
belfort in time to return to paris by four
oclock of the next afternoon with pen-
cil and paper he set himself to the task
of extracting the symbols from the dog
fennel an hour of labor netted him
definite progress toward the key to un-
locking the mystery there were five
lengths cut in the petals adding the
missing petals suggested six columns or a
division of the alphabet into six columns

  the most frequent column of letters
was that symbolized by very slight cuts
the clipping of the veriest fragment from
the tip of a petal he deduced from the
arrangement that the length of the cut
indicated the particular letter column
intended the number of successive cuts
of a particular length the exact position
of the letter in that column he laid
out the alphabet in the six columns and
began experimenting with the headings
the high frequency of the very short cuts
suggested the letter e which appears
most frequently in ordinary usage in the
english language from that beginning
he worked out his headings for con-
venience in manipulating his worksheet
he numbered the columns each number
indicating a cut-length another hour
of effort and the secret key clicked in the
lock his worksheet read

      
a  f  k  p  u   z 
b  e    q  v     
c  h  m  r  w     
d  i  n  s  x

  with the number and kind of petal-
cuts on each flower of the bouquet laid
out on paper it was the work of only a
few minutes to transcribe the secret mes-
sage from his worksheet now that he had
the key thus each petal that was cut
very slightly at the tip referred to the
first column of letters if a single petal
was cut it meant the first letter in that
column-a if five successive petals
were cut it referred to the fifth letter in
the column or e a missing petal re-
ferred in the same way to the fifth col-
umn two missing petals in succession
leading directly to the letter v the
symbols dissolved into letters the letters
grouped themselves into words the words
into sentences the full message read

    french people reacting to editorial pressure
  for peace parley paper influence so valuable
  i am personally directing editorial propaganda
  passing as french journalist this in addition
  to my six other rdles which makes it urgent that
  funds for completion of purchase of le journal
  be sent from new york immediately to relieve
  me of financial details political and military
  situation unchanged

                      -von strindheim

  the meaning of the message disclosed
itself to elton as he rode he remem-
bered the french editorial comment that
had disturbed his peace of mind when the
paper was delivered to him along with von
strindheims first monogrammed cigaret
he remembered german propaganda
operations in the united states before
america declared war propaganda the
weapon which was to help the german
armies conquer the world one sentence
stood out in his mind danced alluringly
before his eyes i am personally direct-
ing editorial propaganda passing as
french journalist and a second line
this in addition to my six other roles  

  by good fortune he got past the mili-
tary barriers along the highway without
being delayed for examination and his
machine working perfectly pulled into
belfort on schedule his stay there was
nothing more than a reenactment of his
previous visit mile dupre weakly hand-
ing him a second photograph from her
sick bed

  it is a much clearer picture than the
poor one i sent before she explained
my dear friend will be so glad to receive
it from your hand monsieur

  elton bowed himself out of her presence
at once without attempting to engage her
in conversation time he felt was now
more precious than anything this woman
might unwittingly disclose besides she
had confirmed one fact by her simple
statement the fact that elton was not
wholly trusted they were depending on
his simplicity rather than his loyalty for
the security of their messages

  racing on paris at a dangerous speed
he gained what he estimated as thirty
minutes by high noon and halted in
another obscure lane to study the photo-
graph it was identical with the first
picture in every superficial detail the
same men stood in the same postures in
the same loose military formation to
all appearances it was simply a second
print a slightly clearer one than the first
the english nephew was not singled out
in ink this time but at the bottom of the
picture was written the line-

this is a clearer print of our dear nephew

 he examined the words for code
meaning they yielded no trace of hid-
den meaning the message must be in
the photograph itself he told himself
but where and how the last of his
precious time was close at hand when
his eye caught a curious detail few of
the men were looking at the camera
when the picture was taken in a posed
picture men invariably look straight at
the camera lens or in that direction
with this clew he searched the picture
again its secret suddenly leaped up
from the print he saw that some of the
men looked slightly to the right others
slightly to the left a few straight ahead
others up others down the purpose was
clear an alphabet cipher message its
words conveyed by the eyes of the sol-
diers allied prisoners forced to pose as
they were told

  on the theory that the germans had
used the same cipher system used in the
the spy trap



flowers he set to work breaking it down
it yielded promptly to this test direc-
tion of gaze indicated one of six columns
of the divided alphabet the number of
men looking in unison in that direction
located the particular letter intended
slowly but surely he wrote down the let-
ters divided them into words and read
the result

    lieut von schiller who should have reported
  yesterday is dependable and able for use at
  american headquarters he will remain at
  your disposal for the time being-

                         -clausswitz

 when he had read the two messages
again and again memorizing every word
he burned the sheet of paper upon which
he had written them stamped the ashes
into the ground and proceeded to paris
the hidden entrance in the subway sta-
tion moved aside to admit him the mo-
ment he presented himself exactly at the
designated hour for his return but in-
side von hintzen had not emerged from
his inner lair to receive the message from
belfort the chamber was empty

chapter ix

elton acts

half an hour elapsed half an hour
in which elton felt the stirrings
of anxiety could it be possible
that he had been shadowed his long
halts along the countryside detected
or had the time of passing given points
en route been checked by resident german
agents german thoroughness would
leave nothing to chance but he found
reassurance in the contempt with which
american intelligence was regarded by
the prussian army they would hardly
be concerned with a fear that their cun-
ning cipher would be unraveled

 sounds of footsteps roused him von
hintzen was coming at last and elton
seated on the floor in a corner of the room
rested his head upon his knees in the
natural pose of a wearied courier he
heard the other enter the chamber and
approach

  i am sent by his excellency to receive
from you a certain photograph an-
nounced an unfamiliar voice

  elton stood up before him was a
young man in civilian clothes a man
of perhaps twenty-four whose straight
shoulders and stiff posture told of military
service the fellow might have been an
american with his clear cut features his
frank open expression and his accent
when he spoke elton in a swift sum-
mary of the man judged him an austrian
of the better class-or perhaps even an
alsatian german or a german-american

  mein gott in himmell

  the man gave a sharp exclamation one
in which fear and rage were mingled at
the moment he was receiving the photo-
graph from eltons hands he let it drop
from his hands

 whats gone wrong now elton de-
manded blankly searching the others
face in vain for some explanation of the
outcry

  so it is you again the fellow had
recovered from the shock of his first
glimpse of the americans face his eyes
blazed in fury as he added through
clenched teeth this time it shall be a
different story mein gott it is a voice
from heaven that brought me here-be-
fore it was too late

  eltons mind grasped the peril in a
flash the german had identified him-a
positive recognition in which there was
no uncertainty a spy nest east of
belfort which he had uncovered on
the american front two weeks before
swept through his mind one espion had
escaped the net there this must be that
man come to paris to serve von strind-
heim

  the german was backing slowly out of
the chamber his face twisted into a malig-
nant grin of triumph when elton sprang
toward him the fellow stepped to one
side to avoid the impact elton missed
and crashed against the wall in a flash
he had recovered himself and rushed a
second time to grapple with the man be-
fore he could sound an alarm or withdraw
from the chamber the german whipped


ared white

out a long bladed knife and raised the
weapon in defense

  i have no wish to kill you the ger-
man said regaining something of his self-
control he held the knifeready to strike
but if you rush again i shall be forced to
let you impale yourself upon my blade
as elton hesitated before the threat
of the glittering blade the german re-
sumed his movement out of the chamber
elton gathered himself for a final plunge
at the fellows throat he knew full
well the fate that awaited him once his
antagonist was clear of the hole then
he would be without even a fighting
chance a rat in a trap left to die of
suffocation besides there was some-
thing more than his life at stake-his
mission-perhaps the lives of thousands

elton precipitated himself
forward with the sudden fury
of a trained boxer and whipped
a swift devastating hook from
short range at the others jaw the blow
landed fairly the german with a cry
of rage and pain lunged viciously with his
knife but a split fraction of a second too
late to reach eltons hand or arm and
before the fellow could orient his groggy
senses elton was upon him one hand
choking off his breath against outcry
the other twisting his knife wrist with
the power of a tourniquet

  there was a primitive barbaric fury
in the struggle that followed both
fought with the desperation of men who
know they fight to the death their pas-
sions fired by war lust and fanned to white
heat by the instinct of self-preservation
it was one mans life or the others
there could be no truce no backing down
elton fought aggressively seeking to
strangle to gain possession of the knife to
end the conflict quickly in the knowledge
that time was allied against him the
german fought defensively struggling
to loosen the clutch upon his windpipe
to retain his grip of the knife to delay
the combat until other denizens of the
spy nest would be attracted to his rescue
the grip at the germans throat began

to tell he grasped spasmodically at the
hand that was crushing the life out of him
in doing so he released momentarily the
iron tension of his knife arm elton his
fighting instinct keyed up to the highest
pitch of alertness instantly seized the
advantage he threw all of his strength
against the knife and plunged the ger-
mans wrist sharply inward

  a stifled gasp escaped the germans
tortured throat at the thrust of the blade
his body sagged his strength snapped and
he went to the stone floor elton seized
the knife in his own hand but he lacked
the cold heartlessness to strike a fatal
blow upon a man who already was dying
instead he moved the german to the cen-
ter of the floor and searched the wall for
the secret spring in a moment the trap
door sprung open and there was a heavy
splash in the foul water below

  his own strength vanished as the crisis
passed his legs buckled under him and
he sank in weakness to the floor elton
sat there without effort to rise his body
convulsed by the ague of sudden exhaus-
tion until he was goaded into animation
by the sound of a sharp voice he recog-
nized the voice of von hintzen and got to
his feet with an effort

  what is the meaning of this lieu-
tenant von hintzen exclaimed sharply
his eyes were searching the chamber
they came to rest upon elton

  with an effort elton rallied his flagging
senses and turned to face this new crisis

  i was attacked viciously-while try-
ing to carry out your orders sir he
said

 attacked-by whom-carrying out
what orders there was a rising passion
in von hintzens voice

  your orders that the photograph from
mile dupre should be surrendered only
to your hands said elton i presume
by the fellows vigor in trying to over-
power me and take the picture he must
have been of the secret police but the
lord was on our side and i delivered you
the picture as you directed

  von hintzen took the photograph
from eltons outstretched hand without
the spy trap



looking at it his eyes were burrowing
into the american

  a smooth one eh he said half
aloud and to what extent did you in-
jure him before you dropped him below
i turned his own knife upon him held
in his own hand as his excellency would
have done it said elton he will not
be back

  fool snarled von hintzen the
man was lieutenant von schiller of our
own service you will pay- he broke
off abruptly and his mood changed his
voice became sympathetic but how
could you know my friend he asked
with a wry smile you were right in
refusing to disobey your orders from his
excellency it was von schillers un-
happy mistake but how sad that he
should find such an end-the gallant
von schiller him with the iron cross
of the second class for extraordinary
heroism in battle to find a grave in the
sewer of paris

  the officer lighted a cigaret and handed
one to elton a cigaret bearing the coro-
net of von strindheim

  so it must go in war he added with
a shrug of the shoulders that closed the
incident of von schiller now we must
take up the duty of the moment you
are very weary my friend

  ill be all right in a few minutes more
said elton

  excellent rejoined von hintzen
it is important that you leave almost
at once for belfort with these flowers for
mile dupre

  elton noted for the first time that the
officer carried a thick bunch of fennel
eloquent assurance that a forced trip
to the frontier had not been devised
suddenly by von hintzen for purposes
growing out of the killing of von schiller

  it is a hard trip but i can make it if
such are my orders he said

  the spirit of a true soldier said von
hintzen his voice became soft and
flattering his excellency is delighted
with your work and if you succeed again
tonight i am empowered to assure you
that you will receive a most fitting reward

for what you have done one moment
please and i will see you safely on your
way

  von hintzen disappeared into the laby-
rinth briefly reappearing in a long coat
that reached almost to his heels on his
head was a linen civilian driving cap and
in his hand he carried a lawyers leather
brief case as in an afterthought he took
a sheet of blank paper from the brief case
extracted a pencil and rapidly jotted down
a message which he sealed in an envelope
and delivered to elton

  please hand this personal note to
mile dupre he smiled graciously it
is nothing more than a list of certain
securities in which she will be greatly in-
terested-and yet it is important that
you deliver it into her hands at the earli-
est moment again bon voyage herr
strothers

gjjjjpj the prussian turned to the
pgh exit bidding elton to follow
pwwx him into the subway station
as soon as the lookout gave him
the door and though elton was out in
the station almost on von hintzens heels
the prussian had vanished miraculously
close at hand stood a french officer of
artillery faultlessly uniformed immacu-
lately groomed elton saw with a start
that the french officers eyes were fast
upon him as he started to move past
the frenchman halted him politely but
firmly

  pardon monsieur the french officer
challenged in a high pitched official voice
but from where does monsieur ze lieu-
tenant come at zis moment one mo-
ment you are not-ze next moment you
are

  i am an american m p officer on im-
portant business said elton with annoy-
ance by what authority do you ques-
tion me

  ze authority militaire shot back the
officer i am of ze intelligence service of
ze armee frangaise please to permit zat
i examine ze carte identite

  with pleasure monsieur said elton
he exhibited the excellent forgery that


ared white

had been provided him against just such
an emergency by the painstaking von
hintzen

  bon exclaimed the frenchman pass-
ing back the identification card now
ze orders of travel

  now see here elton protested fixing
the frenchman with a bellicose glare
youre interfering with an american
officer in the performance-

  elton broke off in mid sentence he
blanketed a sudden upheaval of emotion
within by looking quickly at the ground
and fumbling in his pocket it had swept
his mind when the frenchmans eyebrow
moved very slightly up and down an
involuntary twitching a keen intuition
had bridged the gulf he had recognized
in the pseudo-frenchman the elusive
von hintzen a thousand bits of infor-
mation raced through eltons mind and
pieced together now coherent fitted into
a definite mold von strindheims report
of his half dozen roles von hintzen
then was many men a consummate
actor whose art in controlling posture
expression voice makeup enabled him to
be chief of staff minor assistant french
lieutenant of artillery editor of a great
paris newspaper and when he was not
von hintzen or one of von hintzens
handy men he was von strindheim him-
self

  monsieur does not find ze order of
travel the other prompted elton zen
perhaps monsieur will come wiz me to ze
bureau militaire for interrogation

  dont try to pull that on me elton
glared back now in control of himself
again im on important business-
looking after an american deserter-and
im not going to be delayed by you or
any one else you got my name report
it to headquarters if you want

  he caught a glint of amusement in the
fellows eyes as he forced his way past
and boarded his train the other did
not follow him or raise any further pro-
test what he demanded of himself was
the prussians game in halting him was
it merely another clever test or was there
some deeper design behind the incident

  as the train moved out of the subway
station eltons iron control relaxed his
body shook from head to foot under the
emotion that had wracked him within the
past few minutes he did not question
his intuition or analyze the chain of cir-
cumstance that had flashed through his
mind in the moment of recognition he
accepted it as fact that von strindheim
was a man of many roles a lone wolf
who trusted no man too far-and one of
those roles was that of von hintzen
there remained then but the trick of
springing a trap about that cunning
neck as to how quickly and how effec
tively the esjnon could change his role-
he had just seen the miracle for himself

  thanks for the long days of mid june
elton was well out of paris before sunset
he followed the route to belfort passing
provins and turning off beyond that vil-
lage at the point where the highway forks
to the south and east there was no
thought in his mind of abandoning his
mission as a courier of the prussian
crown it might be necessary to carry
on indefinitely-for weeks perhaps risk-
ing his neck until an effective trap could
be devised with the aid of opportunity
a forcing of the issue now might only
spoil all that he had done and end in his
own certain death

  he halted while the light of day was
yet bright in another secluded spot far
back from the main highway first of
all he must decipher the barons message
of dog fennel now that he had the key
the cipher yielded promptly he wrote
it down letter by letter and studied the
amazing product it read

    request you transfer lt joubert from bel-
  fort to germany and hold him in close confine-
  ment at all times entire propaganda would be
  ruined should he escape and return to his paper

   i am using editorial office to good advantage as
   joubert is last man to be suspected because
   of his war service hasten money from new
   york for second payment shortly due owners
   so they can not object to editorial methods

                      -von strindheim

  the message cleared up the mystery
of another von strindheim role forged
the spy trap



another link in the manacles that threat-
ened the dreaded prussian espion so
von strindheim had caused the french
editors disappearance in order to engage
himself in the frenchmans role prus-
sian gold secretly applied was to silence
the possible protests of patriotic owners
the kaiser then still kept faith in the
insidious weapon of propaganda a wea-
pon with which he sought to weaken the
will of the civilian populace the while his
armies hammered the morale of fighting
armies on the front lines

elton was mounting his
motorcycle when he remem-
bered the note handed him at
the last minute by the prussian
officer it had been crowded from his
mind for the moment by the first mes-
sage since the missive was sealed he
debated upon the discretion of forcing the
flap it could not have been of great im-
portance he argued else von strindheim
hardly would have treated it with so lit-
tle precaution he ended by forcing the
flap of the envelope with scrupulous care
in an effort to leave no evidence of his
prying

  his judgment in opening the letter was
confirmed when he noted that the mes-
sage was in cipher oddly enough as he
saw at a glance it was the discarded
german cipher that von strindheim had
used in his letter to colonel ourq the
brtevity of the message caught his interest
caused him to delay until he had deci-
phered its meaning the cipher message
read

see to it this man never returns to paris

  elton looked at the message only long
enough to check his work for accuracy
then he set his motorcycle in motion
vaulted into the saddle and turned at
high speed into the road that led toward
belfort

  but he knew now that he was not going
to belfort that message forced the
issue with von strindheim elton smiled
grimly at the prussians wily prank send-
ing him with the order for his own execu-

tion it did not surprise him that von
strindheim had taken such a step even
if the messenger fell into enemy hands
the note would be harmless enough and
the message of flowers as inscrutable as
the cable code of nauen so von strind-
heim must have reckoned even as the
prussian leaders laid their dependence in
german infallibility and allied stupidity

an hour at high speed took
him to the first american mili-
tary barrier he removed the
flaming m p brassard from his
arm slowed down to a gradual stop and
told an incoherent story to the sergeant
in charge the sergeant called his lieu-
tenant whose suspicions were aroused by
the officers garbled story of his travels
elton was held for investigation and taken
to the captain in command of the barrier

  i am wanted by g h q he confessed
to the captain a very serious charge
and since ive decided to surrender im
only asking the privilege of talking per-
sonally to my friend colonel rand i
wrote him of my desire to surrender and
he asked me to come here and telephone
him

  the captain registered suspicion but
finally succumbed to the prisoners in-
sistence that g h q must know imme-
diately and from his own lips head-
quarters finally got colonel rand on the
telephone and elton had him dismiss the
local captain from the room during the
conversation

  please phone paris headquarters at
once said elton have sergeant
walters and his men take me in it will
clear his record since it was from him i
made my getaway at-

  see here what are you talking about
elton the colonel demanded

  you misunderstand sir elton re-
joined this is private strothers
wanted for desertion and escape and
heaven knows what else they nipped
me here at the american barrier-and
im asking that my old friend sergeant
walters have a chance to take me in i
gave him a rough deal escaping from him


ared white

in paris last week since im done for
anyhow thinks i its only right to give
him the breaks will you please do this
for an old-timer sir

  i see said colonel rand in sudden
understanding itll go hard with you
strothers wed have gotten you any-
way-but im glad you surrendered
im feeling pretty low sir itd cheer
me a lot if my old c o could say a word
for me at paris before its too late

  ill think it over strothers i was
just leaving for paris headquarters for
conference and may look in on you
thank you sir-if the colonel would
only hurry

as nearly as he could esti-
mate sergeant walters would
arrive by military automobile
from paris in two and a half
hours in five hours he would be back in
paris a prisoner colonel rand by fast
driving could reach paris from headquar-
ters in five hours elton already had
mapped out his plan of attack ample
time remained in which to lay out the
details before midnight he would be
ready to move in upon his excellency
the baron erich wolf von strindheim

  sergeant walters when he arrived to
receive the prisoner met the situation
magnificently his only sign of recog-
nition was a snarl followed by a profane
dressing down of the glum and repentant
captive

  give yourself up did you raged
walters well if they dont hang you
for the stuff youve pulled ill tear off my
chevrons a disgrace to the army you
are and to the whole two legged race of
man my only regret is that i didnt get
sight of you on the highway-within
shooting distance

  when i gave up sergeant i asked to
have you get me muttered the prisoner
i tried to give you a square break
after-

  shut up roared walters get out
there and into that car-and one false
move means well take your worthless
carcass in dead

  during the long run into paris the old
sergeant found an opportunity to whisper
to his chief without risk of being over-
heard by the escort above the roar of the
car

  i hope i didnt lay it on too strong
sir he apologized but i thought that
was the situation

  you did nobly as usual elton said

  i feel something big in the air sir-
any chance for me to give a hand
there was a note of pleading on the non-
coms words

  its very likely walters said elton
but im in executive session at present
if youll excuse me

chapter x

the showdown

a few minutes before midnight
a french rifle battalion war
strength and marching with full
field equipment passed through the heart
of paris the troops had been hurriedly
roused from their quarters and set in
motion the only knowledge they had of
their destination was from the grapevine
that pervades all armies and fills the
ranks with rumor it told them that they
were entraining for the front to meet an
emergency

  at a street intersection the two rear
companies were ordered into a side street
the gait of the others was quickened to
double time in less than a minute the
battalion was in position surrounding a
large four story building while orders
were barked at them to let no one pass in
or out hung from the second floor of the
building was a sign proclaiming to the
world that here was the office of publica-
tion of le journal

  two men in the garb of printers their
sleeves rolled to the elbows and their
faces grimy with printers ink walked
down the editorial corridor at the same
moment they entered the editors office
without knocking there was but one
man in the room at the moment-the
editor-of which fact they had informed
the spy trap



themselves before going in the editor
was half way across the room attracted
by the beating of hobnailed shoes on the
paved street below he stopped at sight
of the two printers and surveyed them
sharply

  you sent for us monsieur inquired
one of the two intruders in perfect
french bowing humbly

  what impudence is this snapped the
editor he walked back to his desk and
was passing behind it when another voice
stopped him with the force of a blow

  not the slightest move

  it was an american voice and it
crackled with intensity behind the
order loomed a  caliber army auto-
matic

  the editor smiled a genuine smile in
which there was an arrogant disdain of
the danger he faced

  perhaps when the guillotine looms
over your necks you will not feel quite
so bold over this intrusion he cut at
them he moved slowly back toward the
wall which stood three feet behind him

  stop move another inch and ill bore
you the man with the pistol threatened
his voice and manner left no slightest
question of his intent

  the first man moved to a window and
crashed his foot through a large pane
the splintering of glass awakened an echo
of sharp french commands below in a
moment there was the rumble of many
feet coming into the building

  who are you and what is the meaning
of this outrage the editor inquired his
iron nerve unshaken

  i am sergeant walters united states
army said the soldier and my trigger
finger is a lot quicker than any trick you
or any of your kind can pull on me

  ah a fool american the editor
drawled sarcastically well i have no
intention of inviting your fire i pre-
sume your attendants will be here in due
time to return you to your padded cell-
and your government will apologize in
proper form

  i said stand tight

  walterss voice was at the end of its

patience his prisoner had edged a foot
nearer the wall

  if i must stand here with my hands
in the air sneered the editor at least i
can have the comfort of the wall to lean
against

  he made another move a slow move
that carried him close to the wall his
hand moved very slowly backward al-
most imperceptibly it touched the wall
a secret panel moved aside then the
room filled with sound the roar of
walterss automatic the sergeant was
hard in the wake of the bullet his arm
clutching the other as he was falling a
bullet through his wrist into the secret
cavity

  walters dragged him back into the
room jerked him to his feet and secured
him by handcuff to his own wrist the
room filled with french soldiers their
bayonets hemming captor and captive in
with a bristling wall of steel

i demand to know the
prisoner cut at the french com-
mandant who had appeared
with his men why this out-
rage is visited upon me i am lieutenant
joubert invalided from the french
army editor of le journal-and it is your
duty to protect me you shall pay dearly
for this my commandant

  not even the gaping wound in his wrist
unstrung the man he remained the most
collected person in the room his thin
cold face was pale and drawn but his eyes
burned with outraged passion the
french major turned deathly pale at the
threat he stammered an apology that
he was following orders that it was not he
who should pay if his superiors had erred

  you can do the rest of your talking at
headquarters sergeant walters spoke
up his voice was even almost respect-
ful tempered by the regard of one brave
man for another please remember that
your only chance to get away is by
dragging me with you he added im
sorry you made me shoot you but if i
have to do it again itll not be in the
wrist


ared white

  at the headquarters of american forces
in paris the outraged editor was met with
an odd edict terse instructions were
given by a colonel that he be stripped of
the french uniform he wore and given a
warm bath a thorough scrubbing even
sergeant walters accustomed to endless
unintelligible orders was nettled by the
instructions the prisoner was immacu-
late spotless clean shaved-the last man
in the world who had any appearance of
needing a bath the sergeant however
insisted upon having the bath adminis-
tered without release of the handcuff even
though his own sleeve got wringing wet in
consequence

  well of all the-

  sergeant walterss surprise was too
deep for mere words he broke off into
speechless gaping at the transformation
wrought by the water the french
editor lost his florid color patches of
dark hair dropped from his head and
changed its contour the lines of the
fellows mouth changed the whole set of
his face though this came from a relaxa-
tion of muscles as well as loss of the skill-
fully applied touch of artifice

  say mister you look to me like you
might be a boche the sergeant com-
mented when he could regain his voice
i was getting worried to tell you the
truth afraid a friend of mine had pulled
a prize bonehead but im feeling easier
since we had our little bath now come
right this way if you please

  good evening my friend im glad
to have this opportunity of explaining to
you why i was unable to reach belfort
with your kind message

the prisoner started at
the sound of eltons voice as
he was brought face to face
with the american in a small
brightly lighted room on the second floor
of the headquarters building a look of
fear flitted across his face then his
matchless self-possession reclaimed him
his blue eyes lighted with a cynical
smile

  do not flatter yourself too far my

friend he said with cool composure i
pay the price of my present slight in-
convenience merely because i disregarded
my own intuitions and judgment he
added hastily as well as those of his
excellency whose judgment i should
have accepted as infallible

  excellent your excellency elton
mocked

  my gratitude for the station to which
you advance me the prisoner bowed

  but why not when you have done so
yourself as a daily practise my dear
baron erich wolf von strindheim
now you flatter me the prussian
smiled complacently without wincing at
sound of the name would that i had
the gifts of his excellency-i would at
this moment be in far more comfortable
circumstances

  eltons face hardened he dropped the
exchange of badinage

  now see here von strindheim he
shot out lets throw off the masks it
isnt becoming to a man of your gifts to
equivocate when theres nothing to be
gained by it youre clever enough to
know that you wouldnt be here if we
didnt know who you are and before
morning well have the rest of your crew
in hand even if we have to dynamite the
walls down on them

  the prussians insolent assurance did
not waver

  i am lieutenant hans von hintzen
he replied i make no denial of my
identity under the circumstances

  very true likewise you are von
strindheim and several other persons-
all one and the same ma

   saying a thing and pi ving it even in
an abominable french c rt martial are
two different things t o proud name
of his excellency will not be drawn
again into your war propaganda as it
was before when they took the wrong
head

  there is the proof of ycir photo-
graph-

  i have had no photograph in many
many years the prussian interrupted
a minor thing but you have a slight
the spy trap



affliction of the eyebrows it was that
my dear baron that first let me see
through your disguises

 mannerisms are contagious my
friend as you must well know

  then perhaps you can laugh off this
little link in the chain my own death
warrant which you handed me to carry to
belfort

  elton took from his pocket the fatal
message to mile dupre and held it under
the prussians eyes the prisoner studied
it impassively from another pocket the
american drew a second cipher mes-
sage yon strindheims favorite cipher
the original of his insulting message to
colonel ourq

  now is the case clear to you von
strindheim he demanded the two
messages were written by the same hand
since the french have identified and
verified your handwriting in the note you
sent colonel ourq-it was a very simple
matter for me to verify the little billet-
doux you handed me for delivery to my
executioner i might add too that i
deciphered your dog fennel cipher in
fact it took little time and effort

  to eltons surprise von strindheim
was looking at him now with smiling eyes

the mask was gone without words he
was communicating to elton the useless-
ness of further evasion no shadow of
fear crept into his face or voice as he
accepted defeat

  my friend he confessed you ap-
pear to hold the advantage of me at the
present moment the smile passed into
a superior cynical glint i will pay you
the compliment of saying i am grateful
that it is not you who is charged with the
further details of my case

  thank you von strindheim you
mean-

  that it remains for french military
law and custody to proceed with my trial
and-execution

  i should not think you would find
much comfort in that thought my dear
baron

  von strindheim shrugged his shoulders
and half turned to indicate that he was
ready to be received by the french mili-
tary escort his tantalizing assurance
possessed him fully again he bowed
stiffly from the waist

  bon nuit monsieur he said per-
haps one day we shall meet again
who can say and in the meantime
bon voyage

fight in ten years he was a camp boss
with the wildest life behind him of any
logger on the northwest coast

  up by muscle and a heart of white hot
steel that was the story of anton
novak the bohunk the men who de-
spised his race he battered out of the way
and here he was thirty and at the top

  at the top so the loggers said a
camp boss for the big brainerd outfit
how much higher than that could a
bohunk look the loggers wanted to
know

  anton novak himself wanted to know
the question had become a torment
during the last year it stared him in the
eyes now as he hesitated in front of the
top loaders bunkhouse a year ago
there would have been no question
then a wrathful telephone message from
the logging superintendent telling him
that the log loads on three trucks of the
camp  train had given way on the main
line would have sent him for his top
loader without a stop for breath

  one huge paw would have gripped the
man by the throat the other would have
been clenched into a threatening fist and
the negligent loader would have been
told what was what in the hottest terms
of logging camp speech with hardly a
trace of the old country growl if the
man had wanted to fight-well anton
novak had become more than an ameri-
can he had become an american logger
of the hardest old-time school

  but the old times were done men in
the northwest woods could no longer be
ruled by fists and calk boots novak had
begun to realize that the two newest
bulls of the woods on the brainerd line
called themselves camp superintendents
and were graduates of forestry schools
novak growled with contempt when he
thought of them he had no fear for his
own job but a chief was soon to be
picked for the headquarters camp the
logging superintendent darby quinn
was already talking of retiring   

  anton novak thought of all this
seriously now as he had thought of it so
often during the past year he wondered

whether he could go any way but his own
would going soft and easy ruin him he
was only a fighter he decided somberly
with the day of the fighter gone he too
would go from the woods-from the
timber country    forgetting his pres-
ent purpose he stared out through the
winter rain

  the timber country it seemed as
grand to him now as it had when he first
saw it a kid with a gang of immigrant
logging railroad builders he had be-
come its man from the first never had
his heart turned back to the old country
once he remembered the land had
touched hisjieart as though he were a
girl

  the end of a day much like this one
himself hanging behind the gang dragging
down the grade to the bunk cars stand-
ing by a douglas fir hundreds of years old
looking out over five ridges of timber
dark green slopes and ridges under low
gray clouds dim in a soft mist and the
first shadows of twilight never had the
rousing smells from the wet mold of the
forest floor so delighted him there were
smells from the great green boughs above
him too and the breeze blowing from
the harbor had a salty tang how he
loved the land just then he had
pressed his fuzzy cheek against the
shaggy bark of the douglas fir and for a
time it seemed that the tree was talking
to him uniting him to its life then sud-
denly he had felt ashamed he had been
acting like a girl but he was flushed with
the strength of manhood for the first
time in that hour the anton novak the
brainerd men knew had been bom he
had seized the vital spirit of the timber
country for his own

  he would not yield this place in the
life of this land of his anton novak told
himself he would use his head he
would speak kindly to the top loader it
would be hard to change his ways but he
could see the necessity speak kindly he
sternly admonished himself as his big
knuckled hand once more reached out to
open the bunkhouse door light flowed
over him as he stepped inside there was

a sudden hush around the bunkhouse
heater

        the hush had fallen in the
midst of a loud declaration
rly from the shadows beyond the
heater-

   and if that highball bohunk of a boss-
man tries to tell me anything   
novak knew that voice it belonged
to the man he was after-spade brackett
for three weeks a top loader in camp 
novak halted in the doorway the rain
drove in behind him before him the
light of the swinging lamps glowed over
faces turned toward him be saw the
gleam of excitement in every eye he
felt the blood leap to his face the old
ache for battle throbbed in his knuckles
the bunkhouse gang knew he had over-
heard the top loaders contemptuous
speech they were waiting for the camp
boss to show himself in his bully style
for ten years he had met trouble with
fist and boot the urge was powerful in
him now

   but this new resolve was also powerful
in him novak was still determined to
use his head to prove to the brainerds
that he could be as gentle and kind and
tactful in handling loggers as these new
men fron the colleges the slur on his
foreign birth he could afford to ignore
long ago he had learned the futility of
fighting against that but he had come
here to settle a matter of work with his
top loader and he had found the man
expressing contempt for him before the
other loggers that made the business
harder to carry through but he would
try so he worked what he thought was
a kind smile on to his heavy dark face
as he swung toward the heater

   brackett here he said in his rum-
bling voice

  you bet im here

  the top loader stepped out from be-
hind the heater and faced the camp boss
belligerently

  what you want with me huh

  he was certain that novak had heard
him and he did not intend to back

   down not before this bully gang spade
bracket was mighty sure of himself he
was no older than novak he was as husky
and he had got his name in a fighting way
a seattle policeman was responsible he
had pinched brackett after the man had
cleaned out a skidroad saloon

   fightin like this is what i call diggin
your grave with your fists said the
policeman come along spade

  he stood now before novak his feet
spread wide his legs stiff his fists on his
hips and his chin jutting forward over
his barrel of a chest his heavy black
brows were drawn together in a fighting
scowl his small eyes glittered savagely
before novaks steady gaze

  the sleeves of his red wool shirt were
rolled up and the light of the savinging
lamps shone on bulging forearm muscles
he was lean bellied and solid in his legs
a true fighting man of the woods made
by years of labor in the tall timber
feeling fit to battle any man alive
particularly anton novak boss of camp

	in line for the headquarters camp

  spade brackett had his own reasons for
being interested in that but to anton
novak he was only a tough top loader
who needed to be handled gently and
kindly after the new fashion of bossing in
the woods

  what you want with me huh
growled spade brackett get er off
your chest

  every man in the bunkhouse knew that
this was a challenge and not a question
the camp boss knew that they knew
for an instant the habit of years asserted
itself his wide shoulders heaved the
muscles of his legs tensed for a fighting
leap and hard ridges stood under the dark
skin of his jaws the old urge blazed up
knock the man down give him the
boots kick him out of camp kind and
gentle palaver hell not for him-but he
remembered in time the approaching
vacancy at headquarters the new way
in the woods-darby quinn would hear
of it if he battled the top loader now
even john and jesse brainerd might
hear of it too much to lose   
fist and boot



  brackett he said steadily i want
to see you in the camp office

  he felt a thrill of triumph as he turned
on his heel no college logger could have
done better than that he told himself
then he heard a gasp of surprise from all
the loggers in the bunkhouse that
troubled him had to show that he was
still a man of authority he looked back
the top loader had not moved-was
staring at him stupidly

  brackett he spoke harshly now
ive got business to talk with you in
the camp office at once understand
yeah

  novak tramped out leaving the door
open behind him he did not look back
again but the hum of excited talk
followed him certain words reached
him

  goin soft ill say    yeah
whod a believed   first time i
ever saw novak   

  then the voice of joe harkins the bull-
bucker boomed above the rest

  never fails ever bully of the timber
goes the same way goes along with the
hard stuff so far then turns soft fightin
fire dies out finished you ask me
thats highball novak

  the camp bosss boots thudded to a
stop in the muddy trail to the camp office
the darkness was rapidly closing down in
the timber about the camp the wind
roared through the boughs in a sudden
hard blast and novaks spirit rose to meet
it

  now was the time go back-declare
himself-fight it out show them all in
the only way he knew-by fist and boot

  but this new resolve had been strongly
taken he could play the new game of
the boss-men of the woods play it as well
as any he would hang on as he had
stayed with that runaway logging train
years ago the bohunk kid was still
going to the top

  yeah hed show em-but in the new
style gentle and kind   

  there was brackett coming out of the
bunkhouse the camp boss strode on for
his office

  back in the bunkhouse a young logger
a lowly whistle punk listened to the old-
timers recite the saga of anton novak
the bohunk kid the champion high-
rigger of the harbor camps the hardest
bitten bull of the woods the brainerd line
had ever known

  finished now said joe harkins
yeah the others agreed-excepting the
husky young logger the whistle punk the
lad down in the time-book as p parker

  p parker had had two years of college
he was trying logging instead upon the
advice of an old fashioned uncle he had
expected a glorious rowdy life in anton
novaks camp he still hoped for a
terrific battle between the camp boss and
the top loader so he followed brackett
to the camp office he was pleased to see
that the timekeeper was not behind the
commissary counter so young p parker
waited there breathlessly for the roar of
battle to sound from beyond the par-
tition that divided the commissary from
the camp foremans quarters he heard
nearly all that passed between the two men

anton novak slowly
lowered his muscular bulk into
the swivel chair before his
desk impressively he turned
around as brackett stepped inside his
office the chair squeaked under his
weight the sound jarred on novak he
swore under his breath a swivel chair
in a logging camp that was the new
damned style shiny desks swivel chair
files paperwork- well he had mastered
all the new stuff by ferocious study and
he would master the new way of man-
handling he would not pass out with
the oldtimers he would have the head-
quarters camp he would follow darby
quinn he would go on rise high

  keep your grip on that he ad-
monished himself sternly hang on like
you did as a bohunk kid

  well whats on your chest said the
top loader with careless insolence

  sit down said the camp boss calmly
motioning toward a chair a matter of
business


james stevens

  spade brackett was taken aback
despite himself he was overawed he
tried to tell himself that this was only
highball anton the bohunk boss sitting
there in the fancy swivel chairtwith a
mackinawed elbow resting on the shiny
oak desk but somehow the files the
desk light the books and the cold aloof-
ness of novak created the atmosphere of
the brainerd offices in the tidewater
lumber town down there brackett al-
ways felt like as timber savage in a cage
cold blooded business system that
same atmosphere made him uncomfort-
able now he was on the defensive he
sat down and fumbled his hands awk-
wardly over his knees

  brackett i hired you with the under-
standing that you were the best top
loader on the brainerd line said novak
in a cool impersonal tone which jesse
brainerd himself might have envied
thats your reputation in headquarters
for three weeks youve failed to make it
good tonight darby quinn telephoned
me that three trucks fell to pieces on the
main line he knows your reputation
the blame falls on me im supposed to
handle my men in the way to get the best
out of em usually i drive-you know
that

  novaks words sounded like licks from
an ax out in the commissary young p
parker held his breath but the camp
boss caught himself

  highball anton they call me he
said lowering his voice but im not
trying to drive you brackett if youve
got a grudge against me for any reason
tell me and ill clear it up you stick
with me and you wont regret it i
promise you that fair and square theres
all my cards a wide open hand i want
you to do your best top loading for me
if youve got a grudge just tell it and well
fix it up

  there novak stopped it was the first
time in his life he had ever reasoned in a
nice gentlemanly style with another man
it left him feeling ashamed of himself
but he remembered the stakes he was
playing for and he bucked up he fixed

a cold but kindly gaze on spade brackett
and waited

  the top loader was still overwhelmed
with astonishment he had never
dreamed that highball anton would
knuckle down in this style for that was
all that the cold modern business talk had
seemed to brackett-knuckling down he
had a glimmering of what novak was
after for he too knew all about the
promotions that were to come on the
brainerd line but he had no conception
of the thought and labor with which the
man who had fought his way up under the
old conditions of logging camp life was
concentrating on adapting himself to the
new ways and methods brackett would
have sneered at the notion that highball
anton was attempting a new style of
man-handling to him the camp boss
was only showing yellow at last

  a bohunk at heart showin up he
said to himself me ill just tease him
along

  spade brackett had his own stake in
the game he had no desire to be fired
just now unless it was by means that
would make trouble for the camp boss
so he said aloud

  why i aint got a grudge mr
novak i thought you had the grudge
account of me bein a friend of shag
hawley you know worried me some
bein blamed for my friends  

  brackett stopped there as a low fierce
growl escaped novak the big hands of
the camp boss gripped the arms of his
chair shag hawley bull of the woods
at camp  was also in line for the head-
quarters job a whisperer a back stabber
a slick tongued blarneyer but a logger
and a fighter a dangerous man in a
way novak feared him but he hated and
despised the man still more he glowered
suspiciously at brackett but controlled
himself

  never mind hawley he said keep-
ing his voice level and cold you might
explain the bad loading on those three
trucks today

  it was my loyalty done it said spade
brackett
fist and boot



  he was now entirely at ease he was
sure that he could soft-soap any bohunk
alive

  small logs mr novak didnt want
em to pile up behind the loadin engine
rushed the loadin wanted to get out
a full train that was all just my
loyalty mr novak my damn fool
loyalty said spade brackett grandly
rolling out the words as though he loved
the sound of them

  novak scowled it might be true
there was no answer to such talk as that
anyway

  well he said heavily ill let er go
this trip but dont be so damn loyal
tomorrow load your cars like you know
how

  ill load em perfect youll never see
better loadin mr novak promised
brackett enthusiastically loyalty
thats me

  all right

  novak turned back to his desk some-
how he felt badly licked he turned
sharply as brackett went out he was
certain that the man had laughed there
was a flash of red before novaks eyes
one lunge took him out of the chair and
to the door the wind blew rain out of
the night and against his face he felt
the powerful pungent breath of the tim-
ber country he heard the roaring
whispers of great green boughs

  the timber country his own to
keep his place in its life-that was the
greatest battle the desire for that held
him back let brackett go he would
handle him yet-new style novak re-
turned to the chair it squeaked again as
he sat down he did not notice that now
seemed like he was licked somehow he
had to win-had to hang on like the
bohunk kid   

  the young whistle punk p parker
slipped back into the bunkhouse un-
noticed and no one paid him any mind
as he sat by the roaring heater and
listened to joe harkins tell mighty
stories about the heroic battles of high-
ball anton novak who once belonged to
that old-time company of bulls of the

woods gone soft now old joe lamented
yeah the old-timers were no more the
old days were over

  p parker the young college logger
mournfully and silently agreed he
glared at spade brackett and wished that
he himself had five more years of growth
and muscle he knew what handling the
man needed spade brackett was boast-
ing that highball anton had backed down
before him in the office declaring that the
camp boss had entirely lost his grip and
boasting that his friend shag hawley
would be the next boss of headquarters
camp

for ten days the boss of
camp  held grimly to the new
style of man-handling and
for ten days log production in
camp  dropped two thousand feet by
two thousand feet choker-setters loafed
with the rigging fallers and buckers
grew careless and trees were brought
down in crisscross fashion and were
bucked into logs of odd lengths the
donkey-punchers on the yarding and
roader engines no longer jumped at their
levers and ran the drums at top speed
the loaders sent out beautiful loads but
not so many of them every man in camp
agreed with spade brackett about high-
ball anton no  was a highball camp
no more the bull of the woods had gone
soft take er easy was the word

  at the end of the tenth day anton
novak felt like a whipped man he stood
on a bank above the loading track and
mournfully observed the logging scene
it was a stormy day the distant ridges
of the timbered hills merged dimly into
the low rain clouds a gray mist was over
the fallers and buckers muffling the ring
of axes and the drone of saws the prone
columns of the felled timber lay on wet
black earth the skyline rigging reach-
ing from head spar to tail spar a distance
of twenty-five hundred feet made faint
black lines against the gray sky rolls of
gray wood smoke and puffs of white steam
drifted up from the donkey engines

  huge logs in the grips of chokers on the


james stevens

main lines plunged up the slopes swayed
dipped into the black earth crashed over
stumps battered brush and small trees
into slivers leaped high and boomed on
for the storage pile from thee other
logs were lifted by the loading engine
swung over to the trucks on the loading
track eased into place and bound with
chains by the top loader and his second
man

  at the end of many and many a day
anton novak had felt his heart swell with
pride when beholding this scene of labor
in the big timber he was the ruler of it
all he anton novak once a bohunk
kid swinging a pick on a logging railroad
grade had fought his way up to command
over the bully men of a brainerd camp
a man had to fight his way up in those
days it was different now he thought
grimly

  different yeah the old days of
sawing chopping and ground-lead skid-
ding were gone six donkey engines were
under his command now miles of wire
rope head-blocks weighing a ton each
logging trains section crews and even a
camp laundry which washed the bunk-
house sheets and pillow cases

  sheets for loggers well that was what
it had come to loggers were skilled
mechanics these days highly paid men
had to handle them like they were white
collar lads in offices had to if you were
going to hold on to all for which you had
lived and fought

  the quitting whistle shrilled through
the woods the men were already
stringing in from their labor novak
scowled at that how was a man to stop
that unless he threatened to knock their
ears down how did the college bosses
do it it was still all a mystery to novak
well he would hang on until he learned
he would not turn back he swore to
himself

  novak sighed heavily and started down
the bank his purpose was to catch
spade brackett on the way to camp and
demand a showdown one of the whistle
punks had put a bug in his ear about
brackett the top loader had been

agitating-knocking the props from under
the authority of the camp boss novak
was determined to settle this affair with
brackett once and for all time there
would be no battle he vowed he would
use his head-settle the business in the
new soft and easy style of handling men

  but as he waited for brackett novak
saw the logging locomotive come to a
stop with its string of empties and
darby quinn the superintendent of all
the camps swung down from the cab
novak felt a chill race up and down his
spine instinctively he knew that at last
the place in headquarters camp was open
here and now darby quinn would either
tell the boss of camp  that he was
stepping up or briefly remark that he was
going on to spend the night at shag
hawleys camp novak knew darby
quinn

  the old logging superintendents face
was like granite when novak tramped up
to meet him

  hello novak he said shortly
whats the trouble

  trouble said the camp boss me-
chanically already feeling the sinking
sensation of defeat

  yep trouble your productions
dropped to the bottom of the six camps
what the hell

  novak resolved to take his licking like
a man

  its me he said steadily meeting the
steely gaze got no excuse to make
mr quinn equipments ok sos the
timber i quit highballin the men
tried to talk to em like one of your col-
lege supers i aint swore at a logger for
two weeks not even that well ive
fell down but im sticking to it ill
learn if youll give me the chance

  thats the new policy admitted
darby quinn but we want logs

  youve always had em from camp 
before declared novak

  yes

  quinn looked away he belonged to
the old school himself he too had
risen by fist and boot his sympathies
were all with anton novak but the new
fist and boot



brainerd policy was an iron law if
novak could not survive-well he would
have to go

youll get your chance he said
finally youll get it-here at camp 
im passed over for the headquarters
job the red was creeping into novaks
face and the question was a growl

  yes said darby quinn we de-
cided on hawley this morning

  with a great effort novak choked back
the violent words that surged into his
throat he would take it he told himself
take it and hang on he would hold his
own in his timber country show em yet
that he could grow into the new ways
he attempted a great show of unconcern
as he said to darby quinn-

  whos takin hawleys place at
no 

  for answer quinn lifted his hand
motioned toward the gang of camp
bound loggers who were approaching
down the track and called-

  brackett come over here

  novak stared in stupefaction as the
grinning top loader swaggered over from
the gang the other loggers stopped and
watched curiously among them p
parker whistle punk watched with wide
eyes novak came out of his astonish-
ment with blazes of red flashing over him
the old tide of battle so long damned
up would no longer be denied it leaped
through his veins in a burning flood he
had an instants clear picture of all that
had happened to him brackett had
come here to play hawleys game with
the promise that he was to have hawleys
place when the boss of camp  stepped
up to headquarters now he knew the
meaning of what that whistle punk had
told him about bracketts talk in the
bunkhouse the loggers thought he had
turned yellow

  yellow hed show them even though
the showing would mean the loss of all
he had fought and labored for in the
brainerd camps as brackett still grin-
ning approached novaks white teeth
gleamed in a savage snarl cords of
muscle stood out from his throat he

clenched his hands until his fists were as
solid as mauls his great body weaved
from side to side he hunched his
shoulders his chin jutted over his chest
his knees bent for a spring and just as
spade brackett opened his mouth to
speak the mighty right fist of novak
once more the highball bully of the tall
timber smashed over it with a sound like
that of an ax bit sinking into dead wood

  from the young throat of p parker
whistle punk shrilled a wild whoop of joy
an old-time logger battle was on

spade bracketts fame
as a fighter rested on his exploit
in licking seven men in a
seattle skidroad saloon with-
out being knocked off his feet in his
bunkhouse boasts at camp  he had de-
clared that no man had ever brought him
down but now the loggers saw him
lurch backward like a log when the main
line yanks it in tow his shoulders hit the
wet earth first his legs waving wildly in
the air feet wide apart his right fist still
out novak stood over him for an instant
then his calk booted foot swung as brack-
ett rolled swiftly scrambling back to his
feet the boot thudded into the small
of the top loaders back

  it was the old-time way of battle in
the woods the loggers recognized no
namby-pamby rules-as they called them
-of standing up and poking prettily at
one anothers noses and lips and then
waiting kindly for an opponent to get up
when he was knocked down fist and
boot that was the old fight you knew
you would get and could give the whole
works when you tangled with a man from
the tall and uncut

  no one in the gang of loggers looked
shocked or voiced a protest when novak
booted the man he had knocked down
instead

  walk on him joe harkins yelled
give him the calks leave yer mark on
him highball

  but brackett was as yet unhurt he had
only been goaded into a fighting rage his
brawny left arm whipped around novaks


james stevens

leg as he rolled to his knees and as the
camp boss staggered and tugged to free
himself bracketts right fist smashed him
in the groin novak sagged when the
black fog of pain cleared from his eyes
he was underneath and bracketts pitch
hardened fist was hammering on his jaw

  with a mighty heave novak freed
himself rolled to his hands and knees and
leaped to his feet brackett blood
smeared wild eyed faced him poised for
a charge novak shook his head the
scene quickly cleared before him

  beyond brackett were the loggers be-
yond them the timber the rain clouds
there was his life all that he had fought
for-lost now with darby quinn coldly
watching from behind lost he had
loosened his grip on it just for this just
to give battle to a man who had injured
him novak felt the fire die out of him
and in its place leaped the cold light of
deadly hate all he had left was the
opportunity of breaking an enemy he
would be sure cautious he watched
catlike at an instant when bracketts
guard slacked ever so little novak
leaped again

  but this time brackett only staggered
he did not go down he did not even re-
treat more than a step he slugged
novak solidly on the chin for fifteen
minutes then neither man yielded
ground they stood toe to toe and ex-
changed blow for blow they clinched and
tugged yanked heaved shoved swaying
around and around in a circle then
breaking they stood toe to toe again and
swung hard on each others jaws

  they stared from bruised eyes both
gasped through cut and swollen lips for
half an hour it was an even fight then
in the last stages of exhaustion they
went down together in a clinch novak
was on top grabbing wildly with his
hands he seized bracketts left wrist
as the top loader heaved up against him
novak forced his arm back of his shoul-
ders he pried up on it and brackett
groaned with pain

  quit huh panted novak got
enough

   for answer a hand that was still power-
 ful suddenly clutched his throat his
 breath was shut off but novak could not
 free himself without releasing the top
 loaders arm he threw all of his re-
 maining strength into forcing it up to the
 breaking point but the tensed muscles
 still resisted him and the choking hand
 only gripped his throat the tighter waves
 of darkness swept over his eyes then a
 horrible weakness smote him in the pit of
 the stomachj

   he was going    going  his own
 grip slipping    licked    licked   
 he wanted to say it    then the shrill
 cry of p parker pierced the thickening
 shadows

   dont quit youve got him dont
 quit dont quit

  yellow he thought vaguely they
 would say he was yellow-a bohunk a
 last surge of strength swept into his arms
 he yanked savagely desperately a yell
 of pain sounded from the bulk under
 him the hot iron binding his throat was
 gone and he was on his feet swaying
 voices sounded through the roar in his
 head   that damn whistle punk  

   i knew you could lick him oh gosh
 what a fight

  and darby quinn growled-

   finishes you novak

   then he was weaving through the trees
 for camp-alone

finished he thought
numbly as he sat at the fancy
oak desk slumped in the swivel
chair his battered face resting
in his hands the grip of the bohunk kid
had slipped at last could not hang on to
the new life he had shown them that he
had not gone yellow that was his only
consolation it amounted to nothing
actually when he thought of all he had
lost-his place in the life of the timber
country finished every man would be
against him now

   the door of his office slowly opened
 darby quinn thought novak dully
 coming to tell him to get out of camp and

	off the brainerd line
the deserted gold camp



  it was darby quinn he spoke but in
the voice of a chastened man

  young brainerd insists im wrong
he said i admit it since ive heard his
account of bracketts agitation and i
agree with the lad that you should go to
headquarters

 agree with who said novak his

head whirling again who are you talk-
ing about

  jesse brainerds nephew and sole heir
who came out here to learn logging on his
own hook said darby quinn his rock-
like countenance breaking in a wide grin
hes down in the timebook i think as

        by courtney mccurdy

              the thunder-throated stamps are still

                  the rock-shelves rifled of their store

                          and fortune challenges no more
                the miners pick the gamblers skill

                  stark silence holds the grass grown street

                      the dust claims its eternal debt

                    where men from earths far places met

                the unhinged doors show mirrored bars
                in cerements of spider-shroud
                below prone head-boards hide the proud

     e

the germans of the ships
crew awaited der tag-
and then on the high seas
came the news of war

the last

it was a very slow passage that the
big bark lyderhorn was making in
the latter part of  on the
long road from puget sound to
falmouth her lower hold was three
parts full of lumber from the forests of
washington state above the lumber
was barley and her betwecn-decks hold
loaded with lumber in the forward part
and with barley from the mainmast aft
was no more than three parts full she
was light in the water and being light
should by rights have made a fast pas-
sage but after three weeks with barely
any breeze she ran into two long calms
one after the other and when she picked
up a breeze again it was from dead ahead

  old george gwilliam her skipper was

nigh to going crazy wally brown her
mate cursed himself for a fool for having
stayed so long in windjammers when
first he went to sea wally had hoped
some day to be the skipper of a flyer such
as were silberhorn and goldenhorn but
they and matterhorn and englehorn too
were gone from the face of the waters
of all the fine horn ships only bluff
lumbering lyderhorn was left alone in
the darkness wally often shook his head
and spat in a heartless fashion to the sea

  gilbert cutting the second mate who
spent his dog watches in poring over
navigation books endeavoring to prepare
himself for one more try at getting a
mates certificate at the end of the voyage
did not much care how long the voyage
of the horns

might be the longer it was the more
time hed have for figuring

  and the eight apprentices quarreled and
laughed and swapped the pictures of
their girls around and talked of getting
into the naval reserve bye and bye all but
tomkins the eldest who was in the re-
serve already and a scotch boy who said
that a man who went to sea was a fool
he was going to quit the sea and find a
job ashore something easy and with
some money in it and a belgian boy
who was going into the congo steamers

  lyderhorns foremast crew were a
mixed lot that voyage it was a hard
matter to find an english speaking crew
for a sailing ship in 

  there were half a dozen spaniards in

the crew or perhaps they were chilenos
they were dusky anyway and had lithe
limbs and very black eyes it was wally
brown who took their knives and broke
the points off them on the first day at
sea wally though a very easy going
mate never trusted a dago

  there was a frenchman in the focsle
with the dagoes in the starboard focsle
gilbert cuttings watch gilbert cutting
swore at him only a little less than he
swore at the dagoes but because he was
far and away the best seaman in the
watch picked him out for all the fancy
jobs of splicing and so forth and
johnnie crapeau muttered mon dieu
and in as far as possible kept out of the
way of eight germans who comprised the




bill adams

port watch under wally brown the
germans were most of them big men
with a taste for teasing a quick tempered
and very temperamental little french-
man

  the remaining member of the second
mates watch was joseph a young
jamaica negro perhaps he has scarcely
any place in this story but there he
was black as your hat sloe eyed flat
footed a very passable seaman and ex-
ceedingly proud of being a fellow citizen
to seven of the eight gay apprentices
and he was the apprentices special
delight

  on a dark night the irish lad would
cover himself with an old piece of white
canvas and stalk up to the focsle head
where joseph would be keeping lookout

  the first time he did so joseph leapt
down to the main deck yelling that there
were hants on the sea the second
time he ran to the poop and tried to tell
gilbert cutting about the hants
and gilbert cutting took a belaying pin
from the rail and chased him back for-
ward the third time joseph made for
the poop again and old george gwilliam
who chanced to be up and taking a mid-
night stroll in his pajamas ordered the
negro put in irons

  delirium tremens said old george
gwilliam

  for the twenty-four hours that joseph
was kept locked up the eight boys
laughed up their sleeves and gilbert
cutting whod once been an apprentice
himself kept his own counsel

  it was the grin on tomkins face that
at last made the skipper suspicious he
ordered the negro released and the ap-
prentices sent aft and since he had no
evidence he gave his boys a piece of his
mind in general

  next time any of you get caught
stealing from the cook ill give every one
of you a bad reference said he but
when they were gone he said to himself
every one o them lads o minell make
a cracking fine officer theyve the stuff
in them too bad it is that they will have
to go into those dirty streamers

  had it not been for the eight sturdy
germans it would have been a hard
matter to handle the big barque the
dagoes were light johnnie crapeau and
joseph were light but those eight were
beef and they never hung back when a
good pull was needed and as they
hauled they laughed at the second mates
light watch and at the young apprentice
lads had it not been that they did not
want their own faces busted by wally
brown the eight boys would have taken a
try at busting the faces of the eight
squareheads wallys motto was a
peaceful ship

  roll and go you blasted old cargo
tank said the apprentices

  if i dont work these problems to five
places of decimals the examinerll fire me
for sure grumbled gilbert cutting

  and me like a fool thinking id ever
be skipper of a clipper muttered wally
brown oh well more days more
dollars

  yes thought old george gwilliam
who had made up his mind to retire at the
end of the voyage i will buy the little
farm a mile out of monmouth i will
have alderney cows some black pigs and
a flock of speckled chickens

  yah laughed the biggest of the ger-
mans his round blue eyes on the flushed
face of johnnie crapeau vee eat oop der
french

  the other germans chuckled so
johnnie crapeau went to the deck and
sat on a bollard while the six dago
sailors slapped their thighs and pre-
tended to be very much amused

  having quite made up his mind to re-
tire at the end of the voyage old george
gwilliam had gotten over his impatience 
by the time that he sighted pitcairn he
hove his ship to for an hour or so off
pitcairn and what with pineapples green
coconuts mummy apples oranges and
bananas brought off by the natives she
looked like and she smelt like a floating
fruit store when they headed her away
toward cape horn again

  and though of late theyd been rather
more quarrelsome than usual the ap-
the last of the horns



prentices were at peace when pitcairn
dipped under the sea their bellies were
full and a full belly always did mean a
contented apprentice the mates were
contented too germans dagoes french-
man negro all were content theyd
both seen and scented land again and no
voyage lasts for ever one of these days
theyd come to port draw their pay and
in the sailors fashion own the earth
awhile

         it was a week after leaving
the island that lyderhorn
sighted a black hulled cargo
ran tramp coming up astern dense
smoke pouring from her funnel she
panted through the sea as coming to heel
at the call of her master an old bitch
pants through dew sodden grasses

  tomkins hoist the ensign ordered
wally brown well speak yon dirty
old tramp shes some blasted furriner

  up fluttered lyderhorns ensign on
came the panting freighter and till she
was close abeam of the windjammer took
no notice at all of her flag then as her
colors ran aloft there came over the
tumbling blue waters a loud burst of
cheering from lyderhorns bows eight
german sailors raised a long deep
throated shout another moment and a
gold braided officer upon the steamers
bridge was bawling something to the
eight bawling in a lingo that none but
they aboard the lyderhorn could make
head or tail of bawling in such a tone
that you might have supposed that he
and not old george gwilliam at all was
their commander and as he bawled the
eight looked from one to another with
astonished unbelieving questioning faces
and when he was done the biggest of the
eight shouted something back to him
and by then the freighter was out of
hearing

  so it was that tidings of war came to
the homewardbound lyderhorn and came
to her eight german sailors only for at
the order of their big one the other seven
kept their counsel

  vot ve going to do asked one

  ve vait ve see replied the big fel-
low some vay ve gots to obey der
orders

  toward sundown the breeze freshened
wally brown blew his whistle and called
out all hands to trim the sails last in-
stead of first as had hitherto been their
custom came the eight german sailors

  step along here you squareheads
bellowed wally whats come over
you

  youll get your faces busted yet said
tomkins to a german pulling beside him
whyn hell dont you use your weight 

  ve use der veight all right dont
you mind dot answered the german
solemn eyes on the apprentices sneering
faces

  when johnnie crapeau went to the
wheel that night it was too dark for
gilbert cutting to see that his lip was cut
and swollen but looking by the binnacle
light into the little frenchmans eyes he
wondered at their fiery sparkle

  tough on you john frog aint it he
asked having to live wi all them
squareheads

  squareheads the frenchman recog-
nized that word hed heard it so often
on the lips of the apprentices

  zose peoples said he zose peoples
zey is all ze time speak vot zey call zee
tag but gilbert cutting was gone out
of his hearing

  damme if i think ill ever pass for
mate grumbled gilbert cutting as he
paced to and fro in the darkness

whats come over those
men in your watch mister
asked old george gwilliam of
wally brown next day
theyre loafing on the job

  it must be them blasted apprentices
sir answered the mate theyre all the
time threatening to bust the square-
heads faces

  send them to me said the skipper
and aft came the eight apprentices

  you will understand i will have no
fighting on my ship boys said the skip-
per we must get her along we cant


bill adams

make a good passage if there is bad blood
aboard her

  the trouble with those lads mister
said the skipper when the apprentices
were gone is that there isnt enough
work

  lyderhorns decks had been holystoned
on her slow way down the pacific they
were spotless her paint work had been
scoured it was spotless because her
tophamper was all in first class shape
there was little that even wally brown
could think of whereby to keep the
watches busy

  put the young blackguards to chipping
in the lazarette mister said the skipper
importantly

  down to the gloomy ill smelling
lazarette went the apprentices and there
wally set them to work at chipping
ancient rust from plates and beams

  chip-chip-tap-tap went the chipping
hammers for a minute or two after the
mate was gone and presently hearing
no sound in the lazarette beneath the
saloon in which he sat skipper gwilliam
rose passed quietly into the stewards
pantry and looked down the lazarette
hatch in the deck thereof

  a fellow that goes to sea is seven
sorts of a silly fool came the voice of the
scotch boy specially with a welsh
skipper welsh skippers are mean as
satan

  they arent half as mean as the
scotch retorted tomkins heatedly
whereat a spirited fight started in the
lantern lit lazarette

  george gwilliam descended un-
observed

  who started this he asked

   i did sir said the scotch boy

   i did sir said tomkins

   any more of this sort of thing and ill
give every one of you a bad reference
warned the old skipper and ordered the
two up from below

  you two are the oldest hands in the
half deck said he when they stood be-
fore him in the saloon you should
know better

  he had to say something and did not

know just what to say hed been raised
in a clipper himself back in the grand old
palmy days before the steamers came to
spoil the sea and he felt half sorry for
the apprentices of his slow bark

  yes sir said tomkins very respect-
fully and yes sir said the scotch boy
equally respectfully

  any one of old george gwilliams boys
would cheerfully have followed him to
hell and back

  old george gwilliam led the way to a
store room adjoining his cabin because
lyderhorn had once made a voyage to the
china seas there was in that store room a
rack containing a dozen martini rifles
there were also a couple of cases of
cartridges

fetch the carpenter said the skipper
chips show these boys how to clean
those rifles said he when the car-
penter came thatll keep em quiet
said he to himself

  chips said tomkins when the old
man was gone were you ever in the
china seas

  chips had been much in the china seas
he was an old man even for a ships car-
penter many ship carpenters were very
old men hed seen the borneo pirates
come off to board a yankee clipper bound
for boston with tea he was from boston
himself he talked of borneo china and
boston

  its rotten we werent born sooner
said tomkins theres no scrapping
nowadays

  them boys sir they thinks they
owns the earth said chips to the skip-
per as he passed through the saloon on
his way back to his shop

  i am retiring when she gets in
chips said the skipper who chanced to
be feeling conversational i am going to
have a farm

  i retired two or three times myself
sir answered chips it dont never
work a man comes back

  i shall not come back chips an-
nounced old george gwilliam

  maybe not sir replied the car-
penter she aint in yet anyway
the last of the horns



if one knows the art of loaf-
ing on a job it can take a long
time to clean an old martini
it took tomkins and the
scotch boy a full week to clean the dozen
rifles wally brown didnt interfere with
them neither did gilbert cutting
neither did the skipper though once or
twice he did put his head into the store
room to growl

 no smoking in there youll be
getting bad references yet

  meantime the other apprentices chip-
ped rust in the gloom of the lazarette and
talked of their girls and the sydney
larrikins and called one another liars
and stole an occasional smoke and an
occasional snooze and the foremast
sailors wiped and polished and wiped and
polished again the dagoes chattering
contentedly the germans strangely
silent strangely solemn almost morose
they seemed to have become and so the
big bark came at last to the dreary waters
westward of cape horn and there at
last she found wind instead of mere
breezes

  there was no more wiping or polishing
no more chipping rust tomkins and his
comrades took their places on the deck in
battle with the roaring westerlies day
after day the wind howled and lucky it
was for the big slow bark that it did
howl for von spees cruisers having
vanquished admiral craddocks fleet off
coronel were in hiding amidst the islands
to the northward in readiness to slip out
and scour the seas for allied commerce
at the first lull in the gales

  while lyderliorn rolled on into the
atlantic wally brown and gilbert cut-
ting raved day after day at the eight
german sailors for they it seemed had
lost all interest in their labors had be-
come afflicted with some mysterious dis-
ease that quite precluded hurry for all
the raving of the mates for all the gibes
of the apprentices they were never the
first aloft moreover it often happened
that when they had furled a sail it
shortly afterward worked loose so that
dagoes or boys had to go aloft to restow

it one might have supposed that they
had a grudge against the bark

  aware that the best men of his crew
were become slackers george gwilliam
ordered their allowances of grub cut
down that did not cure did not even
improve them for them to rob the
dagoes johnnie crapeau and the negro
was a simple matter and the robbed and
not they went hungry

  on a shrieking wind blasted evening
when the germans food allowance had
been cut to a bare minimum the dagoes
johnnie crapeau and joseph at last went
aft to seek justice they were half
starved shivering sea soaked blood
and bone were chill

  monsieur mate monsieur mate
cried the little frenchman from the sea
swept quarterdeck to wally brown on
the more or less dry poop above zosc
peegs-zose peegs-

  wind drowned his voice hissing
sprays whipped over him

  zose peegs- he began again and a
grayback rolled over the bulwarks
knocked him down bowled him into the
rushing scuppers and half drowned him
wally shook with merriment as dagoes
and negro followed the furious little
frenchman back toward the focsle

  in the shelter of the midship deck house
johnnie crapeau turned hating every
one on earth and everything he leaped
for the nearest dago and clawing at one
another they rolled together into the
bubbling scuppers five of his comrades
at his heels tomkins ran out to see the
fun

  their big one cheering to the dago the
germans came streaming from the focsle

  cowed by a sudden blackness of the
windward sky dagoes frenchman and
negro clung in the rigging while with
lyderliorn surging through a roaring sea
fists and belaying pins flew

  as wally brown and gilbert cutting
came forward on the run a fierce squall
beat the wallowing bark there was
no time for discussion of any sort

  get the fore topsail off her ordered
wally brown


bill adams

  all hands fore topsail down-haul
shouted gilbert cutting

  the second mates men the eight ap-
prentices made for the rigging but the
eight germans went as one man to the
focsle

  you here get out bellowed wally
at the focsle door

  the big blue eyed blond man looked
steadily at wally and slowly shook his
head the seven shook their heads

  refusing duty are ye asked wally
and none of the eight made any move or
answer

 the mate hurried to old george
gwilliam on his poop pistols in their
hands skipper and mate went forward
together

  whats the meaning of this de-
manded the skipper knee deep in swirling
water without the focsle door and had for
answer only gloomy stares

  pistol in hand the skipper waited
while wally brown went aft for hand-
cuffs while gilbert cutting saw to the
furling of the topsail wally ironed the
wrists of the germans as they went to
the sail locker hatch beneath which they
were to be imprisoned he took the knives
from their belts and as wally shut the
hatch upon them those eight german
sailors broke into song it was all
dutch to wally

  the squall eased the windward sky
opened clear gilbert cutting followed
old george gwilliam and wally to the
poop and in their focsle the dagoes
muttered together they were hungry
and now with the mates men locked up
would be harder work than ever very
well they would not work the ship
might rot for all of them they had been
made to work on every saints day now
they would not work at all joseph
shuddered as he heard them but
johnnie crapeau sat on the sail room
hatch and called down insults to his
tormentors

  that work would be far harder than
ever did not trouble the apprentices at
all they hoped the dagoes would refuse
duty too then it would be up to them

to bring the old hooker to port they
could do it they never for a moment
doubted that they could do it good old
skipper good old wally brown good
old cutting

  have ye had fightin enough boys
laughed chips looking in on them

  but the wind was lulling and before
a boy could answer the shouting of
the mates brought them all to the deck
again somehow with only frenchman
and negro to help them they shook out
the fore topsail and hoisted it again
not till the heavy sail was stretched did
wally brown report to his skipper that
the dagoes too were refusing duty

  lock em up ordered the skipper

  alone belaying pin in hand wally
herded the dagoes below into the sail
room with the germans but he did not
iron them for one thing there were no
more irons and for another he did not
consider them worth the trouble of
ironing

  during the night the wind fell the
apprentices sang and shouted as they
piled full sail upon the bark by dawn
the weather was hazy the breeze very
light lydcrhorn to the southwest of the
falklands and scarcely moving now
and again from beneath the sail room
hatch there came the noisy chorus of a
german song

history records that while
the battle of the falkland
islands was at its height while
von spees cruisers were run-
ning from admiral sturdcos great ships
there emerged far away under full sail
from the haze a lofty bark she ap-
peared suddenly as though arisen from
the sea then as she had come she
vanished mists engulfed her

  its not thunder what the devil is
it  exclaimed tomkins as he stepped to
the deck just after breakfast on a misty
morning

  while skipper and mates gazed from
the poop while apprentices frenchman
and negro gazed from the main deck all
mystified and none of them dreaming of
the last of the horns



war there swept from the haze a long
gray hull with tall smoke belching fun-
nels a wild cheer rose from the ap-
prentices as swift on her flying heels there
raced another thundering shape

  old george gwilliam turned to wally
brown

  mister said he its the day

  tomkins darted into the half deck
when in a moment he returned his old
dungarees were gone and in their place
he wore the uniform of a midshipman of
the reserve

  who dye think youre goin to eat
laughed the old carpenter

  ignoring chips the eldest apprentice
went to the poop and to his skipper
the fighting ships were lost in the east-
ward haze

  what is it boy asked old george
gwilliam

  the day sir answered tomkins

  were but an old merchantman lad
said the skipper weve no part in it

  may i get those rifles up sir asked
tomkins

  his brows screwed up half in amuse-
ment half in serious thought the old man
looked at his apprentices eager face

  aye get em up said he and when
the boy was gone turned to his mates
dye mind the day we saw yon german
steamer south of pitcairn thats whats
been the matter with your watch brown
theyve known it all along yed best go
see theyre safely ironed

  as wally came to the sail room hatch
there rose a spintering of wood the
germans swarmed to the deck at their
heels came the dagoes shoved aside
wally stumbled and fell the germans
ran on the dagoes stayed to kick him
bruised and bloody he rose and grasped
a belaying pin from the rail as rabbits
drop into their burrows they vanished
down the hatch again

  beside the midship house the mate
paused to help gilbert cutting to his feet
chips stepped from his shop and looked
along the deck the germans were at the
foot of the poop ladder alone upon his
poop was old george gwilliam there

was no apprentice to be seen all were in
the saloon where tomkins was passing
rifles out at the moment that he heard
wally brownrshouting to him he heard
the tramp of heavy feet the sound of ex-
cited guttural voices on the poop ladder

  by the time that the mates and car-
penter arrived on the poop eight germans
were lined up their hands above their
heads

  a little man with flashing eyes sprang
up the ladder after the carpenter in each
hand a belaying pin he was singing at
the top of his voice-

  aux armes citoyens

  his eyes bulging from his head joseph
let go the wheel spokes and without wait-
ing to go down the ladder made the dis-
tance in one jump running forward to
find a safe hiding place he came face to
face with the dagoes stopped in his
tracks and uttered a wail of terror a
peal of laughter rang from the apprentices

  while the apprentices watched the
germans the mates and carpenter dis-
armed the dagoes and herded them for-
ward when they presently reappeared
they carried a heavy mooring chain
they carried it to the poop where the
carpenter shackled eight pairs of german
wrists to it

  back to the sail locker with em
ordered the skipper and turned to the
dagoes

  seeing that the game was up the dagoes
promptly decided that they had all and
more than they wanted of hard bread and
water of being imprisoned in the dark-
ness below decks theyd work cer-
tainly theyd work si si signor
capitan

  there was no more of wiping or polish-
ing for the apprentices now left to
themselves except when if became neces-
sary to handle sails they walked the deck
contentedly or each armed with a
martini were drilled by tomkins while
skipper mates and carpenter looked
amusedly on the dagoes wiped and
polished as though the bark had ever
been their pride and tucking a splice
here and there johnnie crapeau sang to


bill adams

himself and joseph shuddering won-
dered what was to be the end of it all

  in the middle of a dark squally night
an apprentice paused by the sail room
hatch in a few moments he was running
to the poop and having listened to what
he had to say wally brown called the
skipper on deck

  when skipper mates and carpenter
arrived in the sail room there was com-
plete silence there silence that is to any
ears but ears well used to the usual
sounds of a ship outstretched on the
spare sails eight german sailors lay
seemingly fast asleep

  seeking the meaning of a sound of fast
trickling water chips held his lantern
high

  the blasted weasels ejaculated
wally brown

  through a small jagged hole in one of
the plates a steady stream of water was
flowing into the sail room and on to the
hold below while chips prepared to plug
the hole wally brown kicked the nearest
german he woke with a start sat up
and stared blinking at the light one by
one as wally kicked them they sat up
and blinked at the light

  innocent as blasted babies grunted
the mate and sought the tool whereby
theyd made that jagged hole

  up the leg of the big mans dungarees
he found an old iron rust chisel

  for the rest of that night an ap-
prentice was left to keep watch in the sail
room when day came the skipper
ordered the prisoners released from their
chain and locked in their focsle

  thoughtfully sitting in his cabin or
pacing his poop old skipper gwilliam
pondered on the behavior of the men of
the mates watch perhaps if in a ger-
man ship his own countrymen might
have behaved in much the same fashion

  those fellows are all right said he to
himself theyll be asking to be
allowed to turn to pretty soon

  for he was quite sure that the war was
long ago over victoriously over the
fight off the flaklands had without any
doubt at all been the end of it

  skipper gwilliam ordered the prisoners
food increased to the usual allowance
and handing his mate a package of
tobacco he said-

 see that those men have some
smoking mister

 when wally put his arm in at a
focsle port and dropped the tobacco on
their table the germans looked from one
to another with solemn eyes

  ve got to obey der orders muttered
the big man ve got to obey der
orders

mister brown said the skipper
have the boys bring those rifles aft
theres been enough monkey business
very regretfully the apprentices re-
turned the rifles to their rack

  the sea was empty lyderliorn alone
a long slow passage with continual light
winds ah well shed be home after a
while and waiting on the road by
momouth was a little farm alderney
cows black pigs speckled hens

mister mate called the
big man to wally one fine
morning

  well what is it boys
  ve likes to turn to now sir

  now well maybe be able to get the old
hooker along for home said wally but
when no mate and no apprentice was in
sight the big man whispered to his com-
rades

  once more lyderliorn was a peaceful
ship if now and then a dago grumbled
at having to work on a saints day no one
paid any attention the germans worked
as they had worked ere ever pitcairn
was sighted and warned by wally
no apprentice longer dared to seek a
quarrel with them no apprentice very
much cared to do so anyway for war
being victoriously over they felt half
sorry for the squareheads only once in
a while the belgian boy ventured a sneer
gilbert cutting put a stop to that
you damn little dutchie you aint
but a furriner yourself cut it out

  how was a man to give his mind to
longitude by chronometer problems if
the last of the horns



there was to be any more monkey busi-
ness so muttering to himself zese
peoples forget too queek the belgian boy
subsided

  and so by and by the big bark came
up out of the trade wind seas into the
regions of sargasso weed and with a
southwest wind filling her great sails
sailed with the warm gulf stream
waters all about her and long amber
garlands of the weed parting at her bluff
bow and so she came to the north-
westward of the azores and sighted one
somber cloudy evening one of those
islands that evening the southwest
wind died and old george gwilliam
watched his barometer

  and soon a hard northwest squall burst
on the bark and all hands were called
out to shorten sail in a hurry before
four bells at ten oclock the mountains
of the western ocean were flinging tons of
water all across her decks and all the
time that sail was being taken in the
german sailors led the way so that
though caught of a sudden by a furious
squall not a rope was lost and not a cloth
of canvas

  those fellows are a fine lot said old
george gwilliam

  wally brown agreed and so did gil-
bert cutting even tomkins himself
admitted that if only they were not
squareheads theyd be dandy fine sailors
and if the big blond man went from one
to another of his comrades as they
labored in the darkness on the racking
spars and told his plan none but they saw
or heard him sea upon sea thundered
over the bulwarks spray on spray
threshed the topsail leeches

  it was a little after midnight when the
big man beckoned to his fellows and
stepped from the focsle to the water
swamped deck the wind was an unin-
termittent roar

  having bidden his fellows await his re-
turn the big man proceeded cautiously
aft to reconnoiter peering through the
misty closed ports of the half deck he
saw the mates apprentices their tired
arms on the table their drowsy heads on

their arms seeking the whereabouts of
the mate he crept up the poop ladder
the mate was at the helmsmans side
he could just discern wallys dim form
at the outer edge of the compass light
that shone upon the face of tomkins
steering since there was no light in the
chart room the skipper must be below

  enveloped in a blackness impenetrable
the big man returned to his comrades
though the sea tore at his legs swirled
to his waist and at times sucked almost
to his shoulders he proceeded easily
hands on the lifeline feet firm on the
steep pitch of the deck

  once again the big man went aft and
this time his comrades accompanied him
once more he peered through a half deck
port making sure that the apprentices
yet slept a few moments and he had
passed half deck carpenters shop and
cooks galley and stood with a hand on
the door of the lamp locker at the after
end of the midship house there he
turned and his lips to the ear of the man
next him shouted the man next to him
turned and shouted to another water
swirling about them the seven gathered
close about the lamp room door

  the big man was in the lamp room a
marlinespike in one hand a lighted
match taken from a waterproof box in the
other the light of the one match gave
him all the knowledge he needed anchor
lanterns swaying from hooks about his
head interested him not at all wooden
cases chocked in cleats upon the deck in-
terested him much to pry one open
take out two five gallon cans of kerosene
and pass them out to the man at the door
was the work of a moment that done
he waited waited for long enough to
enable his fellows to convey those two
cans to the top of the forward deck
house when the door of the lamp room
opened and a hand reached in he passed
out two more five gallon cans and
thus in the space of perhaps half an
hour ten cans of kerosene were carried
from the lamp room to the top of the
deck house having passed out the last
can the big man nailed down the lids of


bill adams

the emptied cases returned to the
deck and made his way to the top of
the house where his fellows bided his
coming	

  there was a skylight on the top of the
fore deck house beneath the skylight
was a ventilator shaft for the big man
to cast off the canvas cover of the sky-
light to open the skylight and to lower
himself into the shaft was the work of a
moment and with the help of an iron
belaying pin and a marlinespike to force
the grating at the bottom of the shaft was
quite simple it was pitch dark in the
shaft darker if possible than on the top of
the deck house but all sailors are used
to working in the dark

  the big man stood upon the lumber in
the between decks hold to his upreach-
ing hands there came one by one ten
five gallon cans of oil

  the big man worked very swiftly for
at any minute the mate might come for-
ward on a round of inspection in a few
minutes fifty gallons of oil were spread over
lumber and barley in a few minutes ten
empty cans were tossed to the sea in a
few minutes eight blue eyed sailors water
dripping from their shiny oilskins sat
innocently playing a game of cards in the
focsle

         lord what a blow growled
         wally brown upon the poop

  leaning against the wind leav-
ing the comparative security of
the poop for the floods of the main deck
he descended to make a round of in-
spection

  he was but starting on his forward way
when something it might he thought
have been a piece of planking struck him
so heavily that he was winded knocked
from his feet and swept into the rushing
scuppers somehow he regained his feet
and wind and somehow contrived to
grasp a swaying rope and swing himself
to the safety of the boat skids above in
another moment he was back on the poop
speaking down the tube to the skippers
cabin

  blowing very hard sir reported

wally and added the port lifeboats
been carried away

  well a boat more or less did not matter
so very much there were two more like
her one on the skids of the opposite side
of the quarterdeck and one on the top of
the forward deck house but just the
same it might be well to pass some extra
lashings about that other quarter boat
wally brown made his way to the half
deck

  tumble out here you get some
extra lashing round that starboard quart-
erboat the port boats gone and look
out you hold on good damn you and
what dye mean sleeping in your watch
on deck anyway

  wonder if them squareheads is all
asleep too thought wally antt made his
way to the focsle and looked in at a port

  no the germans were all wide awake
and playing cards and he could tell by
the looks of their oilskins that they had
not very long ago been out on deck the
squareheads were all right let them
blasted apprentices get out and lash
down the boat no sense in bothering
good men

  when wally came back to the poop the
apprentices were there waiting for him

  the starboard boats gone too
thunder what a blow both gone with-
out his having heard a sound well the
loss of the quarterboats did not matter so
very much the old hooker would soon
be home now and anyway the big boat
on top of the forward house could hold all
hands if need be

  you blasted boys see that you keep
awake ordered wally

  so the apprentices went back to their
half deck put their arms on the table
their heads on their arms and took
another snooze just as wally had known
that they would

  a few minutes before four of the
morning when by rights wally and his
watch should have gone off duty the
fury of the gale increased gilbert cut-
ting stepped from his room to a quarter-
deck waist deep and as he scrambled
along a lifeline there came to him a
the last of the horns



thought that he would like to have the
board of trade examiners there on that
wind blasted deck perhaps then they
would realize that it took more than
mere figures to fit a man for a mates
ticket

  fresh from snug bunks the dagoes
came sleepy from the focsle and in-
stantly blown very wide awake turned
and crowded back into it for just at that
instant the fore topsail blew clean out of
its bolt ropes with a report like the report
of a cannon and then as a cold white
disc of a moon swung up from the wind
ragged clouds germans apprentices
frenchman and negro were fighting their
way up the rigging to save what was
left of the sail and wally brown was
yelling 

  wheres them blasted dagoes all
hands aloft

 then he was dragging them out
kicking them out fisting them out and
they were feeling for their knives of
course but hed chucked their knives
over the side long ago and after all
the dagoes might as well have been left
below for all they did now was to cling to
the lifelines and prate to their saints
and as now to their knees to their
waists now shoulder deep in rushing
water beaten by yelling squalls and
hissing spray the rest of the crew toiled
till daylight wally brown and gilbert
cutting working with them swore that
they were all of them cracking fine sailors
it was full daylight when a new topsail
was set at last the wind was lulling by
then and setting it they sang the big
blond german leading their singing

  and after the way with many sea
chanteys the big mans singing had a slow
mournful swing to it somehow that
great blue eyed sailor made his singing
seem a dirge in that cold dawning so
much like a dirge that tomkins cried
hey big dutchie cant you be
cheerfuler shes homeward bound
squarehead and wally brown turn-
ing to gilbert cutting asked-

  whose funeral is it gil

  after the sail was set and the germans

were back in the focsle the big man
looked from one to another of his com-
rades

  after der blow coom der fine vedder
said he ve obey der orders

  all looked solemnly at one another and
were silent for all had seen that both the
quarterboats were gone and all that
day they seemed so doleful were so oddly
silent that the apprentices dog weary
themselves but pretending that no such
thing as weariness existed laughed at the
squareheads supposing that these strong
men were tired from the gale

  by midafternoon the wind had blown
out the last of its fury and by the dog
watch the bark was under full sail once
more by nightfall she was slipping along
upon her course with scarce wind enough
to keep her sails full the weather very
misty all about her and after dark the
weather thickened more and more so
that first all the little and later all the
larger stars were hid

  wally brown walked contentedly up
and down the poop a very few weeks
now and the old hooker would be home
and after figuring on a problem or two
gilbert cutting turned in and went to
sleep and old george gwilliam turned
in and went to sleep too and dozed off
with a vision of sleek little alderneys
belly deep in green welsh grasses

  the second mates apprentices and men
were asleep as soon as their heads touched
their pillows of course and the four
boys of wallys watch drowsed their
arms on the table and their heads on their
arms all but tomkins whose wheel it was
from eight to ten but the men of the
mates watch stayed very wide awake
seven of them in their focsle and the
other on the lookout in the bow

 half past eight oclock of a

	pitch dark foggy night

  the big man stepped from
the focsle because he would
be able to hear rather better so he was
bareheaded fog dripped on his curly
yellow head he had counted on utter
darkness but fog was a boon that he had


bill adams

not counted on it would help to deaden
sound

  as very slowly very cautiously lest he
chance to meet the mate or some wakeful
prowling apprentice the big maft walked
aft to reconnoiter he peeped through a
closed and mist blurred half deck port and
saw three apprentices asleep their heads
on the table a few steps more and he
listened at the door at the keyhole of the
carpenters shop long snores from
chips in his bunk just within he pro-
ceeded to the foot of the poop ladder
where he wondered was the mate
the wash of the sea he could hear and
the slow drip of fog that fell from spar
and yard but he could hear no foot-
steps so the mate he knew was not
walking the poop

  slowly cautiously he ascended the
poop ladder and very slowly very
cautiously he stole a little way along
the poop good the mate was at the
wheel talking to tomkins none but a
very easy going mate would be talking to
the man at the wheel but then tomkins
was eldest apprentice and even a mate
can want some one to speak to when dark
sea nights are long and days in sail will
soon be over

  reassured the big man returned to
those who bided his coming

 a few moments more and seven
germans were on the top of the fore deck
house

she was a big a heavy boat
that boat on the top of the fore
deck house dagoes french-
man and negro could have
pulled their arms out and never have
budged her but she began to lift to
sway a little and in a few moments she
hung clear of the barks side and swung
above the water and in just another
moment six germans and the man from
the lookout with them were in her and
ready to lower the instant the word came

 not a sound not a creak or a
groan

  and now the big man was down the
ventilator shaft again and this time he

closed the skylight behind him be-
tween his teeth were matches

  in less than thirty seconds the big man
was out of the ventilator shaft and the
skylight was shut again and its canvas
cover drawn over it

  the bell clanged from the poop three
bells half past nine oclock another
half hour and it would be the big mans
turn to take the wheel and now he
jumped to the lookout mans deserted
station and struck the forward bell in
customary reply

  a-l-l-l-s well sir shouted the big
man and from the poop there came the
deep voice of wally brown all right

  total darkness dense fog and never
a sound not so much as splash or ripple
as the boat took the water 

the bell clanging from the
poop again four bells ten
oclock and tomkins due to be
relieved at the wheel and
this time no bell replying from the focsle
head just drip of fog and sough of sea

  did ye hear that forward bell from
wally brown

  no sir from tomkins

  whats the matter with that square-
head muttered wally and after waiting
a few moments longer went forward

  you young blackguards said wally
brown looking in on his three appren-
tices what dye mean by sleeping in
your watch on deck anyway and why
the blazes dont ye trim your lamp eh
the blasted things stinking none
but a very easy going mate would ever
have allowed his boys to have a lamp
alight during their watch on deck any-
way after this added wally youll
douse your glim in your watch on deck

  so an apprentice blew the lamp out and
the three of them came to the deck

  sniff sniff sniff from an ap-
prentice ill say the lamp was stink-
ing

  thats not our lamp from another
its some dirty old trampsteaming
close we wouldnt see her lights in this
cursed fog and by that time wally
the last of the horns



brown was passing the forward deck
house

  a rope brushed wallys face a rope
had no business there swaying loose in
that fashion he grasped and gave it a
pull to see what rope it was a davit
fall it must have worked loose in the
big blow one of those fools of men ought
to have coiled it up

  wally brown was on the focsle head
where the lookout man who had failed
to strike the forward bell should be
there was no one there in all his years
at sea wally had never before found a
focsle head without a lookout man on it
by night hed find that squarehead and
hed give him a booting

  no one in the focsle

  ostendorf furst meyer muller
lyderhorms mate calling his watch by
name where the blazes was the watch
and what the devil was this stink of kero-
sene smoke

  wally brown on the top of the for-
ward deck house the boat gone

  wally brown stumbling against the
skylight the skylight hot

  all hands on deck roared wally
brown and sprang from the deck house
and dashing aft knocked over two won-
dering apprentices as he ran

  all hands all hands he roared
and awakened by the bellow of their
chief mates voice the second mates ap-
prentices were out of their bunks and on
deck ere ever one of the mates boys was
in the half deck to call them

  johnnie crapeau was out of his bunk
shaking the dagoes and joseph and
chips was out barefooted in under-
shirt and drawers sniffing oil smoke

  lamp room must be afire

  and when an instant later gilbert
cutting was on deck and dagoes french-
man and negro were out and all the ap-
prentices were wondering what in the
world was up chips was in his lamp
room and had seen that some one had
been tampering with his oil supply one
nail pushed not quite home in the lid of
one of the cases told him all he needed
telling

  next moment chips was on the poop
where wally brown was calling down the
speaking tube to the skipper

  shes afire sir the germans have
taken the boat and gone

  and in a flash chips knew all about it
and in a low clear terrible voice was
saying

  theyve set her afire sir there aint
a drop of kerosene left in the lamp
room

  three parts loaded plenty of room
for drafts shed - burn like tinder of
course already a tiny tongue of flame
was licking round the edge of the fore-
ward deck house ventilator skylight
and the dagoes were dashing madly this
way and that from davit to davit
screaming cursing calling on their saints
and tomkins at the wheel was saying to
himself by god the old hookers
afire and the other apprentices were
asking one another where were the
squareheads and the light had dawned
on johnnie crapeau at whose side stood
joseph his eyes bulging from his head

  old george gwilliam stood at the
break of his poop one of his mates to
either side of him the little farm on the
monmouth road was suddenly become
very very far away and wally brown
had altogether forgotten his old dream-
ings and in as far as gilbert cutting
was concerned such things as mates
certificates might never have been in-
vented

  back the main yard and clew the
courses up ordered old george gwilliam
to his mate and to chips he said some-
thing about building a raft to the
second mate he said take the cook and
steward and that boy from the wheel and
get some stores up mister

  and then wally was bellowing orders
the dagoes were far and away too terrified
to even hear any orders so while they
ran hither and thither and got into every-
ones way and were kicked fisted and
cursed whenever they came within reach
of wally the seven boys and johnnie
crapeau and joseph hauled up the
foresail and mainsail and crojick and


bill adams

swung the great main yard aback so that
the bark came to rest and lay motion-
less with a red tongue of flame leaping
hungrily from the forward ventilator
shaft and another from the ventilator
shaft on the top of the midship house
and wisps of smoke creeping out and
round her hatches

  then chips lantern in hand was lead-
ing seven apprentices and the frenchman
and negro below down the after hold for
the sole wood available for the making of
a raft was that of the wooden stringers
fastened to the between deck beams
and time was very short for the hold was
thick with smoke and the heat already
well nigh unendurable only the belgian
boy did not go below to help wrench away
stringers he was just going below at the
heels of the others when the skipper called
him back and thrust a loaded martini
into his hands the decks were alight
now lit with a ruddy flickering glow and
old george gwilliam had seen the frantic
dagoes

  lend the mate a hand said old
george gwilliam and to the mate he
shouted keep them men away from the
quarterdeck mister

  while chips and his hurrying company
dragged stringers from the after hatch to
the quarterdeck and commenced the
building of a raft and while the second
mate eldest apprentice and cook and
steward brought stores from the smoky
lazarette wally with his pistol and the
belgian boy with a martini held the
screaming dagoes back and as the raft
began to take shape gilbert cutting and
tomkins driven from below by the heat
and the smoke lent a hand while cook
and steward stood helplessly by two
skinny little chinamen who could not be
of any use just then

  and bye and bye just as the outer dark
and the fog were a little dispelled by a
rising moon the raft was finished

  old george gwilliam looked down to
his quarterdeck sweat streaked soot
upon their faces apprentices carpenter
and second mate looked up to him it
was a very inadequate affair that raft

 for what with the flame and the smoke
 down below there hadnt been time to
 save a great many stringers

  and back back back warned
 wally brown his pistol levelled and
 go vay back cochons warned the bel-
 gian boy

   get the apprentices and cook and
 steward and carpenter away sir ordered
 old george gwilliam

   there was room for no more on the
 raft even those few would be almost
 too many what with the little store of
 food and the beaker of fresh water

   the deck was very hot by now but not
 too hot for tomkins to dart past wally
 brown through the dagoes and into the
 half deck and when in a moment he was
 back his old dungarees were gone and he
 was garbed in the uniform ofamidship-
 man of the reserve and while he was
 gone his comrades and the second mate
 and carpenter contrived to get the raft
 over the side but no apprentice made
 any move to get upon it neither did
 chips only the cook and steward slid
 down and took the little store of food and
 water

   apprentices and carpenter ordered
 wally brown look alive now

   but chips ascended the poop ladder
 and said something in an undertone to old
 george gwilliam who looked into his
 grizzled face and nodded understandingly

   over with you boys ordered old
 george gwilliam

   over you go lads ordered wally
 brown

   ovaire viz ze garcons cried johnnie
 crapeau ze sheep burn vaire queek
 now

   joseph stood stock still hed go when
 the word came and hed not go till then

   it was tomkins who stepped to the side
 of wally brown

   let the dagoes go sir they dont
 belong with the old hooker we do said

 	the eldest apprentice

   flame was leaping from the sail room
 hatch flame was leaping from fore and
 midship ventilator shafts hungrily reach-
 ing toward flapping folds of foresail and
the last of the horns



mainsail and the deck was almost too
hot to stand upon barefoot as the second
mates apprentices who had been so sud-
denly wakened were standing and in a
cowering group the dagoes faced pistol
and martini

  wally brown handed his pistol to
tomkins and ascended to his skippers
side and as his mate repeated the eldest
apprenticess words old george gwilliam
nodded understandingly

  mr cutting get the men of your
watch away sir ordered the skipper

  over the side helter skelter shoving
and crowding went the dago sailors but
johnnie crapeau shook his head in gilbert
cuttings face

  meestaire cutting said he sil
vous plait eeef you please sir and
gilbert cutting nodded and no one at
that moment remembered joseph so he
stayed where he was and the raft was
gone- 	s

the moon shone bright
upon the western ocean shone
bright upon a boat in which
were eight sturdy blue-eyed
sailors a boat with her tiny sail spread to
the little breeze the sea bubbling about
her bow and sucking round her counter

  tiller in hand a great blond sailor
stood erect his gaze upon the lowering
horizon upon a long low line of utter
darkness swiftly rising from the moaning
sea rim one winter gale just done and
now another coming and only a ships
old fragile boat to face it in

  vot ve do now called the solemn
voice of a sailor in the boats bow

  aye vot ve do now whispered one
and another eyes now upon that fast
oncoming line of blackness now on the
giant steersman

  and the big blond sailor answered-

  ve have obey der orders

  and as the steersman spoke the moon
went out darkness enfolded the waves

of the western ocean enfolded the fragile
boat silence fell silence broken but by
the slow flap of a tiny sail

  silence lasted but a moment a deep
voice broke it a ringing voice that
breaking from the heart of darkness
seemed as high challenge to the growing
wind moan mourning from the throat of
swift awakening storm

  lieb vaterlandl magst ruhig sein

  lieb vaterland magst ruhig sein

  fest steht und treu die wacht-

  drowning the steersmans song the
gale arose wild moaning seething scream-
ing thundering wind out of northwest

the moon shone bright
upon a burning ship upon a
company of men and boys who
gathered on her poop close to
her wheel where smoke was thinnest
eight young apprentice lads an old
welsh skipper a mate and second
mate a grizzle browed ship carpenter a
slight black eyed man and a jamaica
negro

  it was tomkins who stepped to old
george gwilliams side and spoke a low
word or two and old george gwilliam
nodded

  and tomkins went to the chart room
and came forth in a moment with a small
red roll of bunting in his hand and
two other apprentices took the roll of
bunting from his hand and bore it to the
signal halyards and hoisted it and
gilbert cutting reached above their

his jerk the roll of bunting broke wide
open

  and the moon shone bright upon the
ensign of the lyderhorn

  and presently the moon went out and
soon after that the wind rose wild moan-

out of the northwest and the lyderhorn

stephen payne

tells a story of a

most efficient cowboy

not bein eddicated much i
aint got no highfalutin word
for what ails our boss here at
the muleshoe but i here and
now opines that young harry badgley
same bein high man o the muleshoe is
plum goofy in the cranium

  why cause when our old time fore-
man up an quits harry nounces as how
the waddy what proves hisself the most
efficient at all cowboy work-in other
words the most expert cowboy-gets the
job now aint that one lully-coola of a
scheme for to make a plum happy con-
tented family of chap and spur wearin
humans the grouchiest sorest headed
bunch o orrie eyed haters you ever
seen it positively is-take it from
me-an elongated lantern jawed ol-timer

whats commonly known as salty bush

  young harry inherited this ranch and
larnt most of what he thinks he knows
bout cows and the fellers what herds em
a-settin in a desk or chair at an agricul-
tural knowledge box and listenin to some
white collared jazbo spielin bout how
alfalfy and spinnach had orter be growed

  ye-ah and by readin books bout cow-
boys and seein movin pictures of em
jus imagine the mornin harry makes
that nouncement he says

  now whos the best rider whos the
best shot whos the best roper whos the
best bulldogger whos the most efficient
man at rescuing a maiden in distress to
such champion all round top hand cow-
boy goes the position of foreman

  beautiful proposition aint it he


most efficient cowboy



dont want no cow foreman what he
wants is a movin pitcher actor because
im the oldest rannie on the job and knows
that job had order be mine i ventures to
voice my opinion

  harry says i them qualerfications
is jake so far as they goes but they dont
cut much ice you clean forgot to men-
tion as how a cow foreman had orter
savvy cattle and hosses know all about
how to brand said critters an read brands
on em ye-ah know how to run a

roundup and handle a trail herd an-

  aw dry up salty a bull necked
rannie name o sorrel top cuts in

  hes wide enough atween the eyes but
he aint very tall above em hes one o
these ridin fools sorrel top is the kind
o a bronc fighter what can put a half dol-
lar in the bottom o each stirrup and hold
it there with his boot all the time a bronc
is a-bronckin his bronckiest

  heres where i gets to be foreman
says sorrel top for they aint a waddy
on the muleshoes payroll can pack sad-
dles for me-not a buckin hoss

  thats the spirit shouts high man
harry salty he continues to me i
dont care to hear any more of your opin-
ions of course i realize that as you fel-
lows say you are kind of stove up and i
havent seen you riding any bad horses
lately nevertheless youth must have
its fling if an old-timer can not qualify
he must take a back seat

  he pauses and hook bronson rumbles
sorrel top you may be able to ride
but kinda remember youve got to make a
showin at somethin besides scratchin
hair and hide offen a sunfishin cayuse
afore you wins this yere foreman job
now they aint many folks as knows jus
how good i am at shootin at ropin and
at bulldoggin harry that j obs wrapped
up in a package branded with my name
hooks a big raw boned hook nosed
geezer just about as pretty as a crocodile
and every bit as puny as a full growed
plum healthy mountain lion and
gents take it from me that hombre aint
blowin off steam when he announces
what he can do

howsoever relay dick
whos one of these trim flaxen
haired lads with a skin smoother
and softer n that of a two
months old calf rolls him a smoke with a
steady hand and says real scornful

  im in on this too sorrel hook you
two buzzards had just as well go way back
and sit down

  uh-huh and that goes for you too
opines boots mondell a-chewin his to-
bacco thin and dribbling some of it down
his gray beard me he continues i
aint one to brag but i sure am one of
them expert cowboys why i come up
the trail from texas when i was just a
yearlin

  i says nothin but i glares at my four
side pards theres just five of us punchers
and we was a right amiable bunch but
now i notices that is got no monopoly
on the glarin business strikes me right
off as how the waddy what does get to be
foreman of the muleshoe aint goin to
be loved much by the bunch hell be fore-
man of but harrys tickled as a well fed
skim milk colt

  gather up some bucking horses and
the wildest steers you can find says he
well stage this competition properly
get all set to pull off the contests to-
morrow boys i have some friends and
relatives coming from the east im
going to town now and get them and
ill spread the word there so well have
a big and appreciative audience id like
to open this contest to all comers he
adds but that wouldnt be fair to you
boys

  suits me more the merrier says
sorrel top

  and me booms hook bronson

  no returns harry man that wins
will have plenty of chances to defend his
title as the most expert cowboy

  i wont says i plenty grouchy
 cause i aint competin

  what gasps harry

  good reason why snickers hook

  aint there though drawls sorrel
sarcastic

  hey you wallopers snorts relay


stephen payne

dick cut that line out no rubbin
it in on an old range vet my bones
aint brittle and my muscles is limber
ill give you geezers a run for your
money

  but salty says harry gazin at
me scornful boots is most as old as you
and hes going to compete are you going
to lie down

  not prezactly i returns some-
bodys got to boss this monkeydoodle
shindig ill stay with you long enough
for to see as its pulled off proper

  harry dont seem to appreciate that
but as he dont know how to manage a
rodeo-which is about what his contest is
shapin up to be-he turns the reins over
to me merely suggestin as hed like to
put on a few new stunts one in particu-
lar the rescue of a beautiful lady from
somethin or other his cousin arabelle
whos cornin shell be the lady

  every one of them four expert cow-
boys has got to have a stab at rescuin
her says i be kinder tough on her
wont it

  oh shell glory in it says harry and
slips me the lowdown as to why seems
one of the guests is goin to be the straw
boss or somethin of a movin pitcher lay-
out and arabelle wants to show that gent
how she can act

  come nearer to catchin him if she
showed how she can cook i opines
harry sighs

  salty romance and you are complete
strangers

  correct says i i never met the
gent he cornin too

  harry dont answer hes busy watch-
ing hook bronson and boots mondell
havin the gosh awfullest scrap you ever
seen while at the same time relay dick
and sorrel top is also goin at each other
like proddy roosters id told hook and
boots to go bring in a bunch of longhorn
steers and told the other two expert cow-
boys to round up some broncs theyd
always necked their ponies alongside each
other afore this with plenty of cheerful
banter but no flyin fists or bloodshed
but this contest business   

i rambles down and pulls
sorrel top offen relay

cut this and get them
broncs i bellers

  i aint ridin with that purtty jack-
anapes snorts sorrel

  nor me with that two legged bull
growls relay boundin to his feet and
cornin at sorrel head down sorrel tries
to bust loose from me and i gives him
my right paw right behind his ear thus
bustin him proper

   tend to business an do as i told
you i tells relay or ill slap you silly

  he sizes me up belligerent for about a
minute and then goes to his hoss sorrel
gets up holdin his head and does like-
wise harry has been hoppin round and
round the two other expert cowboys
whats all tangled up on the ground
hook has got a death grip on old boots
beard and boots is yellin bloody mur-
der

  salty squeals harry whatll we
do

  for answer i snatches hooks quirt off
his saddle horn and wades into them two
fightin gents in about one second they
doubles up on me things looks doubtful
for a minute but that quirt has a most
awful useful butt end some two min-
utes later them two cowpokes gets very
respectful to salty bush and says yes
sir as they forks their horses and rides
off

  harry looked at me kinda curious a
look i cant fathom as he hooks up to the
three seated spring wagon and pulls for
town im powerful busy the rest of the
day a-gettin some unefficient help
rounded up for to pull off this efficiency
contest at this efficiency ranch

bout sundown the cowboys
what all hankers to be foremen
brings in the broncs and the
steers they dont look like
theyd resumed fistic hostilities but they
aint speakin to one another i has never
seed so much silence round our supper
table we dont eat with the dudes what
harry has brought home though we sees
most efficient cowboy



em prognosticatin about and investi-
gatin things

  harry hunts me up to give me a knock-
down to arabelle we cant find her for
the reason as we later discovers that
relay dick has took her out ridin fast
worker that younker but havin lamped
arabelle i dont blame him none shes
a trim nifty hoofed little lady with curly
yellow hair and them kinda come
hither gosh awful pretty blue eyes

  doggone your hide harry i says
you goin to let that girl get in danger
she wont be in danger he returns
colorin up like a colorado sunset but
he continues ive changed my plans
therell be only one rescue and ill per-
form that

 uh gasps i that fair to your
efficient cowboys

 why not snaps harry ill not
compete against them in anything else
id not do this except that with mr
bemar nicol here it means so much to
arabelle confound that relay dick
anyhow

  gosh i chuckles thinkin young
relays chances o becomin foreman is
mighty slim now then i meets a pom-
pous little feller what appears to have ate
too much all his life and worked too little
who is mr bemar nicol

  he aint so awful old either and hes
huntin for miz arabelle too which
wayd she go hes thinkin of walkin
out to see if he can find her when a lady
what weighs about a hundred and sixty-
nine on the hoof makes her appearance
and suggests its time hubby was helpin
unpack her luggage

  strikes me as arabelles chances o
gettin into the pictures is most awful
good so far as bernar is concerned but
yet most awful remote uh-huh i am-
bles to the bunkhouse and there observes
boots mondell and hook bronson sepa-
ratin their beddin and the stuff in their
mutual warbag they aint sayin a word
to each other but seems to have agreed to
quit bunkin together sorrel top is
sortin out his plunder from amongst that
of relay dick it sure is one happy fam-

ily im glad i didnt enter that contest
even through i wont never get to be
foreman andll have to leave the mule-
shoe for ill be danged if ill take orders
from any one of them three grouchy
rannies relay dick now he might not
be so bad

  i smokes a while but the tobacco dont
taste good and i finally moseys to the
barn for to bed down-my bed bein up
in the haymow i aint much moren got
settled when relay and arabelle rides
in and i hears em talkin

  miz arabelle says relay kinda
husky i dont cotton much to this idea
youve got of joinin the movies

  and why not asks she

   cause stammers relay

  a womans answer says arabelle

  mebbe stutters relay mebbe you

goin to be along with you- he hesi-
tates

  it means everything to me she comes

wonderful rescue tomorrow you will

melts any calf eyed young fools heart

  i can hear relay expel his breath

meanest bucker in the muleshoes herd

act gets a big hand from the audience

   pat hurley says

up beside relays hoss

  folks he yowls theres a misun-
derstanding here im going to perform

  arabelle on her horse right beside me
says in a tense whisper-

  youre a nasty mean old man
most efficient cowboy



  i makes her a little bow

  just oblige me by keepin back out
this arena says i and to relay skee-
daddle

  lopin after him to the corrals i
booms

  all set for the muleshoes ropin con-
test for to determine which is the most
efficient cowboy sorreltop is the first
roper

  whoop says the crowd

  there aint no fence between em and
our arena if a steer takes a notion to
he can run right into em but theys
lined up on the north side of the yard and
the steers is supposed to run east bein
headed that way east and south theys
plenty of space-a thousand acre pasture

  well some punchers whoops outa the
corral a red horned doggie what can run
like an antelope and sorrel top takes
after the critter that steer is so blamed
fast hes pretty near outa sight o the
crowd afore sorrels bronc snakes up be-
side him pat hurley with the flag a
waddy with the watch and me to be the
judge is a-foggin along in the dust

  sorrel makes a good catch all right
snarin that critter by both front feet and
bustin it wide open tyins short work
for that human bull of a fella

  sixty-five seconds yells the time-
keeper

  youre a liar yowls sorrel

  hold this watch boilers the time-
keeper thrustin it at hurley and startin
to climb off his bronc they aint no
man-

  keep your shirt on i interrupts
sorrels disqualified cause he front
footed his steer

  hey you never laid down no rules
sorrel top snorts

  hes correct all the same says hur-
ley id think an expert cowboyd know
the rules

  that silences sorrel top we turns the
steer loose and he disappears over the
steep hill to the east

  relay dick is our next roper an-
nounces i as we lopes back to the corral

  blamed if arabelle aint rode to the

corral and joined relay there they is
settin side by each a-chattin away

  relay gets a little antelope horned roan
dogie what runs straight for a little bit
then dives right for the crowd relay
puts his rope around the little dogies
horns picks him right outa the peoples
faces and lays him flat steer dont weigh
much and relays hoss gets scared at the
way the crowd is a-whoopin and cheerin
relay so at the same moment when
relay reaches the throwed critter that
bronc hightails it with the dogie at the
end of the rope of all the foot racin you
ever seen that cowboy does it and by
jingo he catches up to that skiddin steer
hops aboard its carcass and hogties it

  time i yammers at our timekeeper
for the people has gone mad and is
throwin their hats in the air and whoop-
in

  the gent with the watch has plum
forgot to notice the time a-tall and tells
me so

  dont tell em that say somethin
i orders

  sixty seconds blats the numbskull
as though i wasnt havin troubles enough
at this contest rodeo

  relay stares at the feller for a moment

  i wasnt a second over forty he says
in a cold hard voice

  forty tis bellows hurley glancin
at the watch and relay dick smiles and
waves his hat at the crowd which comes
to meet him and delays proceedings for
five minutes by their congratulations
but harry badgley dont congratulate
him no sir that young mans jaw is
kinda slack and though he tries to get
up beside miz arabelle he cant make it

hook bronson is scowlin
like an old pirate as he takes
his place to rope he looks like
a first class cutthroat moren
ever and he always did resemble one i
noticed the movie picture man bernar
nicol a-sizin hook up kinda speculative
and sayin somethin to the beefy female
what wont let him get away from her
side


stephen payne

  hook has a double rig hull and hes
cinched it so tight his hoss is kickin up
and switchin his tail real provoked-like
he gets a sizable black bullock with red
eyes and one busted horn tother horn
busts as the steer hits the ground at the
end of hooks rope and as the critters
caught by the horns that sets him free
he bounces on to all four feet just as
hook reaches him and away he goes for
the tall uncut hook lopes back to his
bronc which has started rollin to get
shed of the saddle that bronc sure ob-
jects to tight cinchin

  the crowd is jus a-roarin this is the
bestest fun them people has ever seen

  hooks roar is a different kind of a roar
though and the way he straightens that
bronc out and fuzzes after his dehorned
black steer is a caution to see sure as
shootin these muleshoe cowboys is
efficient the black steer and hook both
goes over the steep hill out east me and
hurley and the timekeeper follows em
hook ropes that steer round the neck and
runs on him this way and that but get
the critter down he can not

  hook bronson no time says i as we
rides back to the corral

  harry comes a-trottin to my side

  salty he whispers miserable that
relay dick-i jus cant have him win

  you made your own bed lie in it
says i boots mondell is our next
roper

  boots as i said is a short gent with
a grey beard he looks like a hardy hairy
old pioneer and comes pretty near bein
one takin his place behind the startin
line he says hell be dad blamed if hell
fumble like hook done

  he dont for he makes as pretty a
catch as ever i seen but he stops his
hoss head-on toward the roped dogie and
over said hosss head peels boots saddle
with boots in it as that dogie hits the
end of the rope boots and the saddle
parts company a second later and boots
sets on the ground a-watchin his hull sky-
hootin across the prairie at the end of a
rope fast to the horns of a rapidly travel-
in bovine

  i has to catch that steer to rescue
boots saddle

  ladies and gentlemen booms hur-
ley in that awful big voice of hisn its
unnecessary to tell you that relay dick
has won this roping contest

  that suits the people but it dont suit
the other three buckaroos the ropin
is all relayll win they opines speakin
to each other for the first time in twenty-
four hours dont seem to please harry
badgley much for whats relay doin
but talkin to arabelle some more

  these top notch cowboys is goin to
ride some broncs now i announces
relay dick on pinwheel

  that good lookin kid can ride just like
he can rope watchin him set old pin-
wheel clean and scratch him to a finish
i decides hell make harry a tolerable
good foreman-that is if all a foremans
supposed to know is how to rope and ride
and bulldog steers

  that relay boy says old pat hur-
ley to me while the assisting cowboys is
saddlin black heart for sorrel top to
fork would be a kinda drawin card in
my show business dyou know it
hookd be better i opines you
could advertise him as the only hoss thief
left unhung in colorado

sorrel top gets set on
black heart and that eleven
hundred pound black hoss goes
up among the clouds changes
ends up there and punches a hole in the
earth when he comes back to it all that
does is shake sorrel tops hat off his sorrel
noodle that buckaroo kicks away his
stirrups and scratches that volcanic bronc
from shoulders to saddle skirts his old
quirt comes up and he pours it into black
heart ye-ah he rides just like a wolf-
savage rejoicin and goin high landin
hard that black hoss bucks savage and
silent

  our audience gets up and takes notice
so does pat hurley

salty that hombres a-ridin son-of-a-
gun hes there jus like a sheep tick
black heart quits after awhile we
most efficient cowboy



 dont stop him nor pick him up these
 efficient muleshoe cowboys rides buckers
 to a finish sorrel top breathin just a
 little hard grins at relay and harry
  badgley looks a sight less worried

   hook bronson gets a snake bellied
 little roan cayuse what wiggles shakes
 crawls squirms and bucks all in a spot
 six feet square he never gets over two
 feet off the ground but darned if the
 critter dont wiggle plum out from un-
 der the saddle and hook both after five
 minutes or so hooks so doggoned mad
 he cant spit as he climbs up on the corral
 fence

   and then what does the curly coated
 old hammerhead named uncurried do to
 boots mondell but pitch right to the
 edge of the crowd and send that gentle-
 man over his head right in amongst em
 four men carries old boots out and lays
 him down and one of em says hes an
 undertaker and hell measure boots for
 his coffin boots a-cussin and kickin
 all the time

   arabelle says to relay-

   these people have a most peculiar
 sense of humor

   bronc bustin contest is a tie says
 i sorrel and relay can ride it off later
 if theyre still alive after the bulldoggin
 relay bulldogs first i has to assist
 each one of them buckaroos for they aint
 one of em asll help the others boots
 and hook knows theyre beat but do you
 think theyll help relay or sorrel not
 much

   relays a good cowboy all right you
 got to hand it to the lad the best thing
 he does and how he got his name he
 aint doin today-thats ridin relay
 races he aint never bulldogged much
 but he downs a piebald wide horned
 dogie in twenty-four seconds

   sorrel top sneers

   that jobs in my vest pocket

   he hoolihans a red steer in fifteen flat
 hurley and me faults the fall and makes
 him do it over again uh but sorrels
 mad and bein forced to stop his steer
 afore he throws it the job takes him
 twenty-five seconds harry had yowled

at me to let the hoolihan stand now hes
maddern sorrel is he seems to be a little
sorry that he put on this contest but a
whole lot sorrier he brought arabelle to
it none of the spectators is sorry though
and im kinda havin a good time myself

  hook gets a bull-horned brindle critter
and he leaps from his saddle and catches
the critter fair by both horns but that
heavy animal drags old hook over four
acres afore he finally gets its nose pointin
up at the sky

  yuh done noble yells the crowd and
then cheers the old-timer boots as he
gets ready i aint never seen boots bull-
dog even a yearlin but hes sure game to
try it however hes a mite stiff and
whats he do when he jumps for the
runnin yellow steers head but land
astraddle of the critters neck

  next thing i know hes ridin the
buckin bovine backwards while the
spectators whoops boots falls off and
settin up hauls out his gun and shoots
at the fleein yellow steer that tickles
the people like nothin else has

  hurley and me rides to the old codger
and hurley says-

  boots ill give you a hundred a month
if youll join my show

  huh you mean it say youre on
but what you want me to do

  all you got to is burlesque the acts of
the star performers-be a clown

ley and relay dick lines up side by each
on their broncs and when i gives the
word as the runaway team gets goin

blinders and one of ems sure bound to
rescue you

  that meets with the approval of every-
body even of harry him and relay
gazes at each other like a couple of strange
dogs as they lines up on their ponies
some hands fetches out the team and the
buckboard arabelle sets in it holdin
the lines like they was somethin hot and
dangerous a cowpuncher touches off the
team and away it goes runnin too is

most efficient cowboy

hear a cigaret paper fall

the girl a-clingin to it for dear life

efficient cowboy of them all
the tao

by c a freeman

casual visitors to the philippines
usually form a wrong impression
of the tao or peasant of the islands
they motor past his bamboo baliay at

	a m and find him sprawled on the
floor fast asleep

  hes lazy they decide immediately
but they do not know that the bar e-
foot brown man was toiling with his
long horned water buffalo in the rice
fields an hour before dawn in order that
the animal might enjoy its period of
soaking during the heat of the day

  american soldiers of the insurrection
period found the tao a gallant clever
enemy who if he had but little idea of
civilized warfare could and did fight like
a demon when aroused and who did not
always run when the avenging bayonets
came close

  those of the th army corps who took
part in the great northern advances in
luzon can tell of taos who in small
groups opposed american progress re-
maining hidden in bamboo clumps and
defied with their rifles the bursting
shells of field guns pitiful groups of dead
these misguided peasants formed half
clad boys with a few cartridges and a
scanty meal of rice and fish wrapped in a
banana leaf lying by their sides

  today the tao is but little changed
despite the inroads of civilization credu-
lous easily aroused and easily placated
he is often the victim of scheming
politicians if he does not toil constantly
who can blame him his wants are few
with his bolo he can construct a house of
bamboo rattan and palm leaves and
twenty-seven days work a year in the
rice fields will support him and his
family

  he is intensely superstitious witch-
craft and its practises are part and parcel

of his being often in a frenzy of rage or
fear he butchers a neighbor suspected of
being a mankukulam or witch and falls
foul of the alert constabulary for so doing
but he loves his children and will sacrifice
much to give them an education

  no man can be more hospitable than
the filipino tao he will open his house
to the stranger who taps on the bamboo
pinto at midnight cook him a meal of
rice and offer him his best sleeping mat
he will accept no payment

  his ideas as to independencia are hazy
so he shouts for an immediate separation
from the united states the politicos
have told him that independence will
bring him a white collar and a govern-
ment job and he believes it naturally
any man likes to see his country free but
the tao will naively tell you that uncle
sam will lend the philippines enough
money to run the government after the
islands are freed the matter of payment
never enters his mind

  lovable to a great degree is the filipino
tao and if handled with the right sort of
firmness by americans he becomes an
efficient workman to those he has
known for years he is a loyal friend

  juan de la cruz as the tao is known
and ailine maria his wife do not thrive
in the atmosphere of cities their habitat
is the country-the rice fields the forests
the rivers and the mountains city
dwellers jeer at them the taga-bundok or
ignorant peasants but they are the
veritable backbone of the philippines
they produce and are not parasitical
in remote districts their children still kiss
their elders hands before retiring for the
night after having squatted for an hour
on the floor listening to tales of the
tikbalang the asuang the tjanuk and other
malignant fairies
when the biggest story in a decade

  a novelette
 of the
 newspapermen

deadline

by

henry lacossitt

it was the biggest story to break in
the town for a decade even the
oldest members of the press ad-
mitted it not that murder in itself
was big news particularly you usually
put a twenty-four point head on ordinary
murder plastered art somewhere near
numbered the art as the such and suchth
victim of the year and sent it to bed com-
fortably beneath the banner-but this
story was hot for several reasons

  first it was committed within three
blocks of central police headquarters
second it was committed on the high
level bridge the busiest thoroughfare in
town and the main artery of traffic be-
tween the east and west sides of the
town third the victims were two of the
most prominent-socially and financially
-men in the city fourth the men who
did arnold fly and joseph stanner to
death were members of tony garottas
gang and it was rumored that tony him-
self had been present this last however
had not been confirmed

  here is how it happened

 arnold fly and joseph stanner ate
dinner at the cuyahoga club on euclid
avenue at eight oclock they called for
stanners car in which they had driven
from their offices to the club the car a
sedan arrived they left the cuyahoga
and with stanner at the wheel drove over
superior avenue to the public -square
where a traffic policeman waving the


breaks-with the

at dawn

traffic east-west spoke to them that
was at fifteen minutes after eight

  proceeding up superior they came to
the high level bridge traffic was nor-
mal to heavy midway across the bridge
they were crowded by a big packard
limousine this crowding continued until
stanner was forced to stop his car or
crash into the braces and cables that
flank the bridge he and fly prepared
for such an emergency drew revolvers
and got out of the car

  the occupants of the other car num-
bered six-three in the front three in the
back the man on the extreme right in
the front seat apologized saying that his
car had been crowded and that its driver
in turn had been forced to crowd stan-
ners machine or be sideswiped itself

  fly and stanner undecided stood by
their machine guns ready trying to ap-
praise the occupants of the other car
the traffic on the bridge meanwhile
jammed and a bedlam of horns broke
loose fly and stanner became bewildered
they wavered mumbled their apologies
pocketed their guns and started to re-
enter their sedan

  immediately their backs were turned
the six in the other car drew automatics
and blazed away fly and stanner dead
as they stood fell in their own blood

  the six then leaped from the limousine
one of them tore open a rear door of
stanners car reached in and seized
several sacks another reached in and
gathered up the remainder of these sacks
 in currency the payroll of the
fly-stanner manufacturing company
which was to have been used the next day
the other four covered the cars on the
bridge

  with a bedlam of screeching horns
shouting men and screaming women
around them the six plunged through
the braces and cables to the pedestrians
path along the side of the bridge and ran
to the west end of the structure where a
car awaited them they made their
getaway west on detroit avenue the
whole affair did not take two minutes   

  these things happened on the evening


henry lacossitt

of tuesday the th of november they
startled the town as nothing had
startled it for years-set it to talking
and they made the sweetest copy the
newspapers had run across in a decade

  wednesday a little earlier in the eve-
ning than the time these events had oc-
curred the night before two men engaged
in a conversation   

  you got the breaks thats all
yeah but we had a swell story too
there wasnt anything wrong with
ours

  no i guess not what you got for to-
morrow

  nothin much

  they stopped talking and listened
while a young man across the room called
a string of monotonous numbers over a
scarred telephone the young man was
not very enthusiastic about it

  hel-lo coast guard    globe   
anything doin capn no   
thanks

  the young man hung up the phone
yawned and turned to talk to three other
young men who sat at the table whereon
the telephone rested the two men re-
sumed their conversation the one who
had answered last asked a question-
what you got

  a swell story

  oh yeh

  sure

  what about

  i guess i can tell ya now bob-its
past deadline why about tony garotta
its exclusive too

  like hell you aint gettin exclusive
stories that i dont know about

  no

  no there aint but one thing you
ever did that i couldnt do joe rooker
an thats swim an you aint swimmin
now

  i always could swim pretty well
couldnt i bob

  yeh but thats a long time ago an
thats another story

  this story aint about a long time
ago its about last night i got it last
night

  why didnt you spring it last night

  then i wouldnt have no story to-
night there was enough story this
morning and this wont do any harm
bein a day old

 no well what about tony ga-
rotta

  he was on the bridge by stanners car
when stanner and fly got killed he
helped too

  the four young men at the table looked
up the man addressed as bob looked
blank then incredulous then amused
he laughed

  how the hell do you know the
man addressed as bob was contemptuous

  well i got a damned good reason

     the man who had a
damned good reason sat in
a rickety chair the front legs
of which were dangerously
high above the floor leaning back against
a wall which was decorated with roto-
gravure pictures of actresses prizefighters
debutantes and popular thugs he was
sitting in the reporters room in central
police headquarters

  his was not an arresting presence he
might have been a shoe clerk a bond
salesman or a cook but he was none
of these he was a police reporter for the
globe leading morning daily of the
town

  he was short of stature and broad of
girth his hands were small and pudgy
and his legs and belly as well as his arms
seemed constantly on the verge of burst-
ing his suit the coat and pants of which
never matched

  his head was small and almost the
shape of a fat cantaloup his nose was
large and hooked his mouth was little
and full lipped a dark patch of whiskers
meandered from ear to ear leisurely and
usually were in evidence his hair was
thin and rarely cut and completely sur-
rounded a barren expanse of pasty skin
that overlay his peculiar skull most of
the time he was unwashed-and chewing
a cigar the greater part of which was
hidden the cops all said that joe had
deadline at dawn



had his tonsils out to make more room
for the cigar

  his eyes were dull and black-you
could make nothing of them

  he lounged now against the picture
plastered wall and eyed the man who
demanded to know how he knew that
tony garotta had been one of those six
who had done murder and highway
robbery the night before while ten
thousand looked on

  yeah i got a reason

  better have a good one said bob
his tone was sarcastic tony aint a
gentle guy ya know he might object
an you aint swimmin with him now
either

  he never could swim very well could

he

  no but thats a long time ago too
and you aint swimmin to this story
joe did not answer

  well said bob-he was still sar-
castic-whats the reason

  that said joe aint much o your
business bob oleary but ill tell ya
now that deadlines gone you can run
around to the inspector and verify-
aw-

  -it see you can put it in the
press then but i dont mind doin you
a favor bob ill tell ya how i know
tony garotta was one o them six guys
on the high level last night

  well how do ya know it

  this was not the voice of bob oleary
it came from the door

joe and bob and the four
young men turned sharply to
stare at a tall and brawny man
who stood in the doorway
looking into the dingy littered room at
the six men who sat in the dim glow of
dirt incrusted wall lights five of those
men started violently at sight of the
newcomer the sixth dropped his eyes
and swallowed a little more cigar

  the newcomer surveyed each man
the four young men he passed up quickly
they were only the usual up and coming
cubs but he came to a brief halt as

he looked into the gray eyes of bob
oleary he knew bob oleary then
he turned his attention to the little man
in the rickety chair joe appeared to
be dozing the tall and brawny man
whose eyes reminded you of opaque
glass fixed him with a hard look

  there was utter silence in that re-
porters room then it came down like
a quick fog there was a complete
absence of motion the silence main-
tained as the glassy eyes skewered joes
slumped figure a fire bell a second
alarm rang out a location sharply but
nobody moved a patrol drove up out-
side with a creak and clatter but the
tableau was unchanged the four cubs
looked as if they were about to scream

  well how do ya know it

  there was no answer

  the tall and brawny man took two
steps grabbed joe by the shoulder and
shook him

  i said how do ya know it

  it had been said that joe rooker had
no scruples no mercy no religion the
last indictment did not belong he had
or at least he once had had a religion-his
uncle had been a rabbi but it also
had been said in envy or admiration that
joe rooker was a damned good news-
paper man and that took in a lot

  he looked up now leisurely his dull
black eyes met the opaque ones he
yawned erupted a mass of so iden tobacco
shreds one of the cubs squirmed

  hello tony

  i said how do ya know it 

 know what

  know i was on the high level

 when

  tony garottas glassy eyes blazed
the nostrils of his thin nose quivered
his wiry cruel hands clenched

  you know when you lousy jew

  strong language tony

  i got stronger- tony patted a bulge
just below his armpit

  oh yeh

 ya damn right tony grinned
maliciously then

  somebody sighed a long painful expul-


henry lacossitt

sion of breath it was bob oleary tony
chuckled one of the cubs squirmed
again and crossed his legs joe looked
around tony and smiled at bob

  take it easy bob

  you better take it easier joe said
tony how do ya know it

  know wha-whatd you come down
here for tony anyway

  oh just wanted to see how you boys
was gettin along come on sherlock
give us the lowdown

  well ill tell ya tony and you too
bob and you boys too joe included
the four gaping cubs one of whom was
acting strangely with a sweep of his fat
hand

  he leaned back in his chair again and
folded his hands over his tight vest
there were ashes on the vest he flicked
some of the ashes off with a stubby
middle finger

  its in type- joe flicked another ash
whats in type demanded tony
the story of how i know you was on
the high level last night

  tony grinned bob oleary grinned
the four cubs did not know whether
to grin or not tony laughed outright
bob oleary laughed outright three
of the cubs snickered but thought better
of it the fourth writhed as if in pain
joe brushed his vest

  yeah its in type

  i spose said tony ya got an inside
story o the crucifixion too

  thats too old said joe but i
would have had-my folks was there
anyway the story of how i know you
was on the high level last nights in
type you can read it in a little while
aw come off joe-

  bob oleary might have had more to
say had he not caught sight of tony
garottas face tony was puzzled and
when a killer does not know whether to
be furious or fearful the result is terrible
but he recovered himself

  i spose he sneered the cops know
about it too huh

  yes they do tony howd you
come down here

  right down hamilton to east third
up east third to superior over to
steins on the square for a beer down
champlain to the sta- say he snarled
if ya know so damn much tell me how
ya know it

  he stepped back and eyed joe sus-
piciously bob oleary leaned forward
the cubs their mouths open leaned
forward one of them was still wiggling
peculiarly

  them dumbbells said joe looking
at the end of a new cigar that was growing
shorter they would be out lookin all
over- why yes tony ill tell ya

  remember when we was kids re-
member when ya broke your leg well
tony that right leg o yours nevers been
the same since you always leaned
on your right heel a lot moren ya did
on your left you walk on the side of
your right foot

  every man in the room looked at
tony garottas right foot

  well tony one o the guys that took
that dough out o stanners car walked
on the side of his right foot like you do
the four cubs swallowed hurriedly
bob oleary stared at joe tony ga-
rotta glared down at joes fat head his
glassy eyes unwinking

  yeah- tony garottas voice was
hoarse-and how do ya know that
because said joe he was standin
in stanners own blood i took a flash-
light picture of the print

there was silence again in
the room silence save for
tony garottas sibilant gasp
and the weak sound of bob
oleary clearing his throat joe looked
at the end of his shortening cigar three
of the cubs still sat gaping the fourth
after writhing violently rose from his
chair and started softly for the door

  tony garotta suddenly acted he
whirled pulled an automatic from its
shoulder holster and confronted the cub
where ya goin what

  he pushed the cub in the face there
aint a man leavin this room
deadline at dawn



  he turned and looked at joe tonys
eyes were terrible to see

  you damn kike jerk that story
why tony were runnin the pho-
tograph too

  little flecks of saliva appeared on tony
garottas lips he slowly pulled the
automatic up and pointed it at joe he
stepped forward and pressed the muzzle
against joes temple the cub who had
squirmed looked very scared and very
foolish just then bob oleary stiffened
the other three cubs breathed raspingly

  thatll make an awful racket tony
said joe

  yeah but you wont hear it

  no but the cops will and then whatll
you do

  to hell with the cops

  and youll have to stop and pot these
five guys or theyd make swell witnesses
these five men grew if possible paler
tonys gun lowered a trifle another
patrol clattered up outside he lowered
the gun entirely and stood tense from
the hall came sounds of conversation
men-and they were bluecoated men-
were nearing the reporters room tony
darted to the window he threw a leg
over the sill and looked back

  damn you tony was talking to
joe you wont live till morning

  he was gone

  joe brought his chair down with a
bang he heaved a tremendous sigh and
threw sweat from his forehead bob
oleary turned and rushed out of the
room

  thats right verify it bob

  aw go to hell

  joe suddenly shot out of his chair and
to a telephone

city desk    joe rooker   
joe told to a rewrite man the latest
episode in the fly-stanner murder story

the city stumbled on along
the way to dawn and the
presses thundered through mid-
night beneath cold nitrogen
lamps the clicking mechanisms of com-
posing rooms made murder more articu-

late and then from beneath great
concrete shelters trucks rumbled forth
carrying the story of how joe rooker
knew that tony garotta had been on
the high level when arnold fly and
joseph stanner had fallen in their own
blood while ten thousand looked on and
the city roared around them

  and then the city read

  old men in dented derbies and drooping
clothes sitting in the half light of the
public square like mooning crows mut-
tered sucked their teeth and read their
murder up in playhouse square young
men and women going from theater to
night club paused a moment scanned the
headlines clucked and chattered and
went on over in newburgh the steel-
workers eating their lunch read by the
crashing light of the blast furnaces and
chewed stolidly mysterious huddled
figures hurrying along the thinning
streets read by the light of furiously
winking street signs and went their
ways down along the lake in side
streets in deserted outskirts those who
lingered in the greasy holes of all night
restaurants and the sour holes of speak-
easies read how joe rooker knew that
tony garotta hadbeen on the high level
the night before and out somewhere
in the residence district the wives and
families of arnold fly and joseph stanner
read and wondered   

  and all of these joe rooker saw or
if he did not actually see all of them he
knew for joe would have been a
splendid artist if he had had less com-
prehension

  all of those who read saw the street
edition of the globe in the state edition
of the globe the city read of how tony
garotta had come to central police
headquarters while the laws forces were
combing the city for him and of his
interview with joe rooker and of how
he had threatened joe rooker and of
his escape through the window of the
reporters room

  the press because bob oleary had
verified joes work went extra as did
the news butthe globe had been there


henry lacossitt

first the press and the news challenged
the globe as did the other two papers of
the town and were beaten their copies
lay in stagnant bales on the newsstands
and in the hands of the newsboys for
the globe was serving its own field the
others were invaders during the night
in fact from seven oclock on the globe
was supreme seven oclock was its first
deadline five oclock in the morning was
its final deadline after that final deadline
its vigilance relaxed occasionally if the
story warranted it the plates were made
over on the final but this was seldom to
do this the story had to be exceptionally
big for the press came on the streets
at nine oclock and the globe lost its
supremacy it was the morning and
night paper the press was the evening
and day paper neither could combat
the other successfully out of its own
chronological precinct so established
were these precincts that an agreement
a journalistic treaty existed between
the two which prevented either save
for the occasional extras from entering
the others field the other papers of
the town did not matter the press and
the globe led them all bob oleary
was with the press and joe rooker
would rather have beaten him in a story
than to have sat on the right hand

  so the press and news and the others
who went extra on that rainy november
night failed joe rooker had scooped
the town

  he walked now across the public
square past the old men who muttered
over the murder past the mysterious
huddled figures that slunk along the
thinning streets in the winking light of
electric signs he walked in plain view
and defiantly in the most public place in
the town and he walked confidently
and safely joe rooker knew a thing or
two about men and methods

  but suddenly he started he hurried
into a corner drug store a marked man
and a very successful man in his ill fitting
clothes with his whiskered face and his
half swallowed cigar he changed a dime
at the counter and entered a phone booth

he dropped a coin pushed his hat back
on his peculiar head called his number
sighed spat on the floor and waited
the receiver buzzed faintly and joe
shifted   

hello

hello honey

mrs rooker was a tall mag-
nificently formed and beautiful
woman she loved joe fiercely he
could imagine her now her long black
hair pouring down her back her tall
figure in pajamas and negligee at the
phone she would be a bit sleepy her
great black eyes heavy lidded and
brilliant in the glow of a sidelight she
would yawn a bit and smile a bit as she
heard his voice over the wire and she
would look vacantly at her wrist watch
while he talked perhaps she would be
a little annoyed or would seem so but
joe knew she was used to such things
she had married the best newspaper man
in the town

  hello joe where are you

  joe hung up and stared at the phone
for a moment then he dropped another
coin and worked the hook furiously he
called another number again he waited
the receiver buzzed dully

  hel-lo

  yeah

  thanks a lot chief

  again joe hung up he went out of
the booth and procured more change
then he called another number it was
the globe a squad of police hurried
for protection a long grayhound of an
automobile sped for escape

  joe came out of the drug store and
bought a state edition of the globe
he read the story of his talk with tony
garotta he looked up at the clock in
the terminal tower midnight five
hours until final deadline five hours and
the biggest story the town had known
in years was breaking fast five hours
and joe rooker a marked man-and joe
rookers wife on the way to escape
five hours until deadline   

again joe walked across the
public square past the old
men with dented derbies--old
men sleeping now with their
derbies pulled over their brows and their
drooping clothes wrapped close to their
withered bodies their stories of murder
cluttered about them like dead leaves

  he walked past the post office and up

superior toward the globe he began
to hurry a little he came to a side
street and suddenly stepped back from
the path of a speeding car that turned
into superior and headed east

  joe stood rooted in his tracks he
had seen in that speeding car although
the man had hidden his face hurriedly
bob oleary

  joe ran that is to say he hurried
bob oleary in a speeding car meant
something it was three blocks to the
globe and joe made it more rapidly than
he ever had made three blocks in his
life he came to the gloomy rear en-
trance to the globe building he rang
the elevator bell in a frenzy slowly
the ponderous freight elevator descended
and slowly the old man on it opened the
door joe bounced in

  hello dad said joe to the old
man who slowly closed the door

  hello joe the old mans voice
was very feeble

the ponderous elevator rose to the
sixth floor to the city room a large
barren expanse of desks and typewriters
joe bounced in he hurried to a phone
hel-lo

  chief

  yeah

  joe rooker chief whats hap-
pened chief the wife-

police headquarters on the wire

henry lacossitt

the press is hot after it you watch
every brick in that police station or i

damn brains out

  hey

  the city room jumped it already
was excited it never had seen joe
rooker so excited before

whats this all about

joe looked up it was the city editor
oh-why they got tony garotta
cornered this side o willow beach
they got him cut off every way an are
forcin him to the lake

why the hell didnt you tell me
why the hell didnt you find out
joe was gone he did not wait for
the freight elevator this time he almost
slid down the rail of the six flights of
stairs and reached the bottom

  he could see the car through the door-
way waiting for him at the curb but
he stopped he thought of his wife
his fat little body heaved tremendously
he stood for a moment he wondered
whether he should go back and call his
wife but he dismissed that she prob-
ably would be gone he wondered
whether he should go back and call the
chief again

  suddenly he became conscious of the
old elevator operator watching him he
passed one of his pudgy hands over his
perspiring forehead squared his shoulders
and stepped through the door to the
sidewalk

  he started to get into the car again
he stopped abruptly his hand on the
open door of the car for across the
street he had seen a roadster its curtains
drawn its engine running and the door
of the roadster suddenly had opened

from it a small dark man an automatic
in his hand stepped to its running board
he aimed the automatic at joe

  git goin yelled joe

at the first shot joe fell
forward into the automobile
the second shot close after
passed over him as the car
started the car hurtled around the
corner its door flopping joe lying half
in and half out his feet resting on the
running board and the driver pale and
rigid at the wheel the roadster with
a parting shot sped in the opposite
direction

  and just after the second shot and
just before either car moved the old
elevator operator clutched his throat
frantically strove to cry out could not
as his blood strangled him and he fell
back into his car among littered stories
of murder	

  they had cornered tony garotta but
they had not cornered his men and
tony had put joe on the spot but
they were gaining on tony garotta and
his men for the assassins car did not
go far a policeman standing down
the street in the shadow of a building
watched as joe fell and as the two cars
started he waited calmly he wasted
no words calling to the roadster to halt
just before it came abreast of him he
shot the roadster swerved its driver
slumped over the wheel the car crashed
into a steel lamp post the gunmans
head smashed through the windshield
and the doctor did not arrive in time to
save him for trial

  but tony had other men

  the city stumbled into dawn and the
globes presses crashed through deadline
the old men in dented derbies and
drooping clothes awoke and stretched
and bought a final globe they read
more about murder but they did not
read of the capture of tony garotta
they read something else though

  but the old men in derbies the men
and women over their breakfasts the
steelworkers on their way from nightshift
deadline at dawn



to dayshift the drowsy proprietors of
early restaurants the charwomen who
read as they scrubbed the porters who
read as they loafed the motormen and
conductors as they came on and off at
the car barns and the hundreds of
thousands riding walking to daily toil
who read of murder in the final globe-
they did not know the half of it they
could not know they never would
know   

  it began thirty years before when
the town was not one half its present
size it was then that there came to
the town three families one from
latvia one from ireland and one from
italy

 the latvian went into the junk
business the irishman went into the
saloon business the italian went into
the fruit business the three businesses
were next door to one another and their
owners lived upstairs the three families
became friends then one august dur-
ing the nineties the latvians wife gave
birth to a son in september the irish-
mans wife presented him with a boy and
in october the italian rushed out of his
fruit store and sputtered excitedly to the
sidewalk that he had produced a man-
child

  later when those three boys went to
school the latvian boy liked it pretty
well the irish boy liked it better
but the italian boy liked it not at all
they went to school together for a while
and then enmity grew among them the
italian boy developing rapidly bullied
his erstwhile playmates and they came
to hate him-the irish boy openly the
latvian boy with shrewd and terrible
but prudent passion between the lat-
vian boy and the irish boy there came
to be a rivalry in many things in
athletics the irish boy always won except
at swimming-the irish boy could not
swim at all in matters of cleverness
the latvian boy usually came off first
the italian boy bested them both in
athletics except swimming-he could
swim very little-but they were able to
outwit him

  they left school early and sold news-
papers

  and so they grew up two of them
hating the third the third hating and
contemptuous of the other two and two
of them friendly enemies until well
into their twenties all three lived with
their families the latvian boy grew
fat and all out of shape the irish boy
grew long and gaunt and the italian
boy grew tall and broad and powerful
the latvian boy and the irish boy
stayed in the newspaper business and
became good newspaper men the italian
boy followed many pursuits and became
the leader of a powerful gang he ran
rum across the lake from canada and
he specialized in payrolls

  the name of the latvian boy was
joseph rooker the name of the irish
boy was robert oleary the name of
the italian boy was anthony garotta

  therefore the old men with dented
derbies and drooping clothes and all the
others of the host who dwelt in the
town and read of murder that rainy
november morning could not know the
half of it

the three of them joe
rooker bob oleary and tony
garotta were now engaged in
the absorbing game of fighting
one another as they always had done-
joe and bob friendly enemies and tony
garotta the deadly enemy

  for joe had not been hit by that first
shot

  when the car its door flopping against
his back had lurched around the corner
its driver pale and rigid at the wheel
joe pulled himself into the tonneau
closed the door and rolled over the
back of the front seat to sit down beside
the dazed driver the driver turned his
head slowly and jerked the wheel vio-
lently

  stop a minute said joe

  the driver pulled up at the curb and
stared at joe he wiped his brow

  yeah said joe thats right

  aint you hit


henry lacossitt

   hell no

  but you keeled

   sure before he shot

  oh

  feel like you can go now

   yeah i think so

   then get to the th precinct station
the gears ground and the car leaped
forward the driver appeared to be
exhilarated by joes miraculous escape
he sped through the deserted city morn-
ing and joe looked at his watch it was
two hours and a half now until deadline
two hours and a half until the globe
began to yield to the press joe had
kittle interest in the other papers his
eye traveled around the little dial of
his watch to deadline time he mused
as the automobile like a furtive creature
of a forest night hurtled through the
streets for him there were several
deadlines

  hey

  joes revery vanished and the driver
applied the brakes from either side of
the street appeared men guns drawn
they were bluecoated men

   who-oh hello joe said one of the
bluecoated men thought it was some-
body

  joe spoke and the car started again
a few minutes later it rolled up in front
of the th precinct station joe shot
out of the front seat and hurried up the
walk to the steps he took these with
rank disregard for his tight shiny pants
two at a time he popped into the
room where a sergeant sat behind a desk
and several men lounged about in chairs
these were the members of the press

   joe noticed them all but he saw only
two one of these was bob oleary
the other was the man joe had sent
from the globe

   hello joe said the sergeant

   hello    hello bob

  hi

  joe theres hell to pay that was
benny the man joe had sent to cover
the th

   there sure is said the sergeant

  bob oleary grinned maliciously the

others grunted and shifted in their chairs

 what- began joe

 he got away said benny

joe looked at bob oleary the
grin on bobs face was growing wider

 your deadline- said bob and quit
 that was enough

 joe looked at the sergeant
 the sergeant nodded as if he
 were delivering an opinion and
 wrote something on his report
 joe wondered idly whether he were
 entering the fact that tony garotta had
 baffled the police

 yeah said benny he slipped
 through they got the gang with him
 the five guys mixed up in the murder
 and they got him cornered again hes
 somewhere between hundred-and-thir-
 tieth one sixty-second st clair and
 the lake theyre stopping all cars-
 werent you stopped

 yeh said joe and leaned against
 the desk he stuck a cigar in his mouth

 hes hidden somewhere around here
 the only way he can lam is to get to the
 lake and swim

he cant swim much said joe
absently and looked at bob

 how do you know said the sergeant

 joe looked up

 his mother told me

 the sergeant looked puzzled thought
 it was a wisecrack and went on writing
 joe walked to a pay phone and called
 the office

 city desk

 joe rooker im at the th tony
 got away hes hid out here somewhere
 theyre combin the place ill stick
 around

 all right joe benny called before

 and say    joe told the story
 of his escape the members of the press
 and the sergeant listened intently

 yeah we got most of it from the cop
 on the corner joe they got old dad
 with that second shot though   

 old dad    yeah ill stick
 around for a while and see what breaks
 they might git him in time for makeover
deadline at dawn



anyway say- joes fat body shivered
-heard from that car yet

  what car joe

  the car you sent out to my house
n-no not yet joe you live pretty
far out you know

  you-you aint heard anything else
  no

  all right lemme know will ya
joe hung up he turned to the sergeant
and tried to be casual

  you aint heard anything about my
house have you sarge

  the sergeant looked up sharply he
had caught something in joes tone

  no joe why

  oh nothin i guess

  joe called his house

  no answer said the operator

 joe looked at bob oleary bob
dropped his eyes

  the members of the press at the th
precinct waiting for the capture of a
murderer or something pertaining there-
to settled themselves again it was a
long vigil but a familiar one they had
been on others they dozed fitfully as
the night waned and the western union
clock clicked stealthily

 about them the town moaned and
slept

  joe rooker slid down to the floor
leaned against the sergeants desk and
pulled his hat over his eyes he did not
doze immediately he thought of a num-
ber of things the least of which was not
his own safety but the greatest of which
was the safety of his wife and baby
and he thought of old dad then he
too dozed he had not been to bed
for forty-eight hours

       the sergeant nodded and
n also dozed in the silence of the
ggei murky room there in the head-
trz i quarters of the th he was
roused now and then by the phone but
the members of the press after the first
call or two paid no attention he an-
swered the phone once more

 what the sergeants voice was
a hoarse whisper when    god

  he hung up the receiver his eyes
staring slowly he forced them to look
at joe he gazed at the fat ball of a
man sleeping there beside his desk and
put out his hand then he drew back
trembling twice he did that but each
time as he almost made contact he
shivered once he started to speak but
he neither touched joe nor spoke to him
finally the sergeant his face drawn and
pale sat immobile staring at the opposite
wall

  the city stumbled into dawn it was
a dawn ashen and cold a november
dawn with a fine rain falling

  the globes presses thundered through
deadline and still there was no capture
of tony garotta and still the members
of the press dozed there in the murky
room of the th and the sergeant still
stared at the opposite wall

  then from beneath great concrete
shelters trucks rumbled forth carrying
new stories of murder of how joe rooker
knew that tony garotta had been on the
high level when arnold fly and joseph
stanner had fallen in their own blood
and of how tony garotta had threatened
joe rooker and had sent one of his men
to kill joe rooker of the failure of that
attempt and the success of tony in
escaping the police net also there was
another story   

  a truck rumbled up before the head-
quarters of the th and a bundle of
globes thudded dully on the wet sidewalk
inside the members of the press-in-
cluding joe rooker-with that uneasiness
that comes to the fitful sleeper as dawn
approaches awoke stretched and rose to
move cramped muscles the sergeant
still stared at the opposite wall

  joe rooker laboriously got off the floor
wheezed mightily and swore as he looked
at the clock because deadline was gone
and only by a long chance would he be
able to make a makeover after that
there was no long chance the press
held the field

  joe heard the thudding bundle and
started to the door he stopped a
moment and looked at the telephone


henry lacossitt

half turned to go to it and then went
outside there lay the compact pile of
globes the carrier would be by in a
little while joe walked to the sidewalk
took out his pocketknife and cut the
string that bound the bundle he pro-
cured several papers and went back into
the station he handed one to the
sergeant who took it looking at joe with
an expression of pain and fear in his eyes
joe stared curiously at the officer and
then threw all but one paper in the
direction of the members of the press all
of whom had sat down again bob
oleary caught one

  joe looked at the globe to read the
story he had made

  the banner was good the headlines
were good he noted that the makeup
was striking without being too sensational
the globe did not print diagrams with
large white xs tooled in the plates the
captions declaring the exact spot of dead
bodies he noted that the leads were
vivid and clear he noted all this at first
without actually reading the contents
and then because he was the best news-
paper man in town he noted everything

  he started he staggered as if he had
been struck in the face his fat body
swayed like a toy balloon in the wind
his pudgy hands crumpled the paper
where he gripped it and tore it slowly
something like a gurgle a sob of his
souls agony escaped him

  he wheeled suddenly his dull eyes
were dead no longer they were like
brilliant black onyx he drilled the
sergeant with them and the sergeant
looked away

  you knew

  the sergeant nodded slowly with his
drawn face still averted

  why didnt you tell me

  i couldnt joe i just couldnt

  joe turned to bob oleary bobs
eyes looked out the door into the ashen
chilly dawn

  did you know

  bob oleary shook his head

  joe stood then rocking on his heels
staring at the front page of the globe

suddenly he crumpled it thrust it into
his coat pocket and rushed to the phone
city desk

 you knew you knew

  silence

  you knew damn you screamed joe
why didnt you tell me

  i couldnt joe i couldnt
  yeah-i know

  were not sure joe-

  but joe had hung up his eyes were
like black onyx no longer he gazed
dully at the floor slowly like a bewil-
dered duck he waddled toward the door
pulling the crumpled globe from his
pocket by the murky light in the head-
quarters of the th he read once more

and the old men with dent-
ed derbies and drooping clothes
would read too and suck their
teeth the people over their
breakfasts would read too and cluck
the whole city would read and mutter

  the deadline was past and there was
now no makeover

  for joe read as the people would read
of how his home was bombed and burned
and of how there was no trace to be
found of his wife and child and the maid
no trace perhaps except some charred
things   

  joe wandered out into the ashen chilly
dawn to the sidewalk the rain soaked
his hat and ran down his face where tears
could not run and wet his lips the cold
wind from the lake fluttered little wisps
of his sparse hair that protruded from
beneath his hat and again there came
from his small mouth that inarticulate
sob that was like a gurgle

 he walked a few paces and became
aware of the globe car standing at the
curb the driver had earlier gone out
of the station to look at something he
had not returned he sat now behind
the wheel staring straight ahead of him
joe approached mechanically opened the
door and got in beside the driver he
had sat there only a moment when some-
thing pressed the back of his head and
he heard a voice it was a familiar voice-
deadline at dawn



  i been waitin for you to do that you
dirty kike

  the voice was low and throaty joe
did not turn he did not even start
it did not matter much now if tony
garotta crouched in the back seat of
the globes car and held an automatic at
his head he sat there in the chilly
november dawn staring straight ahead
of him he was conscious that tony
was there but it left him unperturbed
where rain had run before tears now
trickled their way down his fat cheeks
but he brushed them away wearily
have you tony

  yeah for an hour or so

  howd you get here tony

  that dont matter none to you but
ill tell ya i gypped that mob o bulls
at one fifty-third and run between a
couple o houses then i beat it over
here they followed the car the nearer
ya come the less they look so i sneaked
back o the station there then i seen
your car when this bozo here -
tony indicated the driver-come out
i covered him and got in thats all
now you listen-

  joe

  some one called from the door of the
th both joe and tony looked in
the gloom they could not see but they
knew who it was

  answer him

  tony added pressure on the automatic
against joes skull

  yeah bob

  bob oleary descended the steps

  let him come over

  joe said nothing

  joe said bob as he drew nearer
i just saw the globe joe there aint
much to say but-

  dont say nothin

  that was tony garotta he rose a
little in his crouch and waved his gun at
bob bob stopped in his tracks a few
paces from the machine and stood his
jaw sagging

  git in here

  bob still stood staring at the black
automatic

  tony wants you to get in the car
bob said joe

  git in here damn you- tonys
voice was a cold whisper-or ill blow
you in two

  bob got into the car

  now you said tony to joe git
in back here with me too

  joe got out of the front seat he
opened the rear door and started to get
in and for the first time since the night
before in the reporters room at central
headquarters he saw tony garotta he
paused a moment on the running board
and looked at tony garotta and once
more his eyes lost their dullness and
became as brilliant black onyx they
glowed in the chilly dawn but tony
did not notice

  hurry were goin places an ill
sit in the middle

  the self-starter whirred the engine
spat

  you guys said tony are drivin
me out o this mess i got a launch out
near euclid beach i cant get to it
alone but with you two gennelmen i
can make it the car was moving
ill just slide down between an pull my
hat over my eyes im just a drunk gen-
nelman o the press-see an if any bull
or any dick stops this wagon you boysll
tell him just that if you dont ill git
arrested but- tony waved the au-
tomatic briskly-you gennelmen wont
scoop nobody with the story

  tony slumped down between joe and
bob he pulled his hat low over his
eyes but he could see well enough
and his powerful hands were ready so
was his gun

  he told the driver where to go the
car gathered speed turned east and
started along the street that lined the
lake shore

the dawn was slowly very
slowly breaking into a sullen
morning along the street that
lined the lake shore the houses
stood like silent soldiers in the rainy
gloom and on the porches of these houses


henry lacossitt

were editions of the morning globe the
globes car rolled smoothly past them on
the glistening street tony garotta was
taking joe rooker and bob oleary for
a ride

  ya see said tony theys some
rummies due from the other side today
theyre my boys well git the launch
an you gennelmenll be glad to come with

  the car slowed the spotlights of two
motorcycles caught it held it and two
policemen rode up on either side

  they rode on the globe car rolled
on bob oleary heaved a great sigh
joe rooker gazed stolidly at the road
ahead tony garotta raised himself and
straightened his hat

  that was nice of you gennelmen said
tony got a paper

  bob produced his

  hold it for me said tony

  bob held it as tony slumped down
again tony read the front page of the
globe

  well well said tony so they

joe you treat me right joe dont ya

swell story about how you knew i was
on the high level joe-flashlight pic-
ture-walk on the right side o my foot-
tony laughed

  joe turned his head slowly and looked

  down at tony garotta tony saw the
movement out of the corner of his eye
and chuckled joes eyes were deadly
black and they glowed again in the
slowly growing morning bob oleary
saw them qnd started

  take it easy bob said tony
dont try nothin

  he suddenly looked up they were in
the outskirts of the town now the
houses were few and far back from the
street which had become a road

  it wont be long now gennelmen
said tony turn left next street
driver

  the driver turned left at the next
street and drove toward the lake tony
garotta raised himself to a full sitting
posture and pushed his hat back on his
head he looked at the men on either
side of him and laughed bob oleary
looked at him fearfully joe stared ahead

  the car entered a stretch of road not
far from the lake on either side the
uncut trees of a new subdivision grew
profusely

  about a hundred yards farther
driver said tony an then we can
git out

  the driver followed directions

  right here said tony

  the driver stopped

  now said tony you gennelmen
can git out an you too driver

they all got out of the car
then and stood in the fine rain
waiting it was full morning
now but gray and gloomy
tony garotta looked back in the direction
of the main road and then waved them
toward the lake they began to walk
tony behind his automatic in his hand
herding them

  joe waddled along beside the gaunt
form of bob oleary his eyes staring
straight before him

  they reached the top of a low rise
that declined sharply down to the beach
fresh water spray from a drumming surf
blew over them borne on the morning
wind fresh water spray rolled down
deadline at dawn



joe rookers cheeks and became salty

  why joe said tony as he came
abreast the three you got the weeps
joe said nothing

  up the beach a few yards was a shack
built out over the water tony waved
them on they plodded through the
wet gravelly sand inclining their heads
against the wind from the lake they
came to the shack and stopped tony
reached in his pocket and pulled out a
key

  here he said to the driver unlock
that thing

  the driver went to the door of the
shack and unlocked a rusty padlock
he waited

  open it up said tony

  the driver tugged open the doors
they creaked in the lake wind within
was a long sleek speedboat of brown
wood restless on the surging surf that
sloshed and slapped around the enclo-
sure

  now that said tony is some scow
and thats whats goin to take me an
you two gennelmen out to them rummies
and then tony continued borrowing
his wit from a comic strip current at the
time the fun begins

  he waved his automatic at joe and
bob bob watched him fascinated but
joe only stared out at the sullen lake
which writhed under the ashen sky
wrinkled with the fine rain the rain
came in gusts according to the wind
all of the men were soaked

  and you said tony indicating the
driver i dont know what im goin to
do with you i guess-

  he raised his automatic and pointed
it at the man the driver put up his
hands as if to ward off the bullet he
probably meant to scream but he only
moaned and shrank as he backed away
i wouldnt do that tony joe said
the hell ya wouldnt

  tony snarled and whirled his move-
ment was threatening as was his voice
but joe neither started nor flinched
no said joe i wouldnt

  and why tony was sarcastic

  because he aint done nothin to
you

  oh yeh well hemight do somethin
i aint leavin him here to run an squeal
soons we put out

  he turned back to the driver the
driver still stood with his hands up
foolish puzzled terror twisted his face

  you might tie him up

  tony dropped the gun a little

  you got lots o murders already
tony

  tony wheeled again he stepped for-
ward and smashed joe across the mouth
with his fist joe staggered back bob
oleary trembled the driver dropped
his hand and began to sob the rain
coming in gusts according to the wind
diluted the blood that oozed from joes
lips and trickled through the whiskers on
his chin

  the blood excited tony

  you fat kike when you get potted
youll bleed like a stuck hog shut up
he screamed at the sobbing driver

  the driver choked on his sobs and
coughed they were all silent for a
moment joe wiped his mouth with
a dirty handkerchief

  well whatd i tie him with

  one o those lines joe pointed at
the moorings of the boat

  tony considered

  well he said finally lets git goin
he waved them into the shack

  just to make sure he wont holler
said tony

  he swung the driver dropped with a
sigh-it might have been of relief-as
the barrel of tonys automatic struck
his skull

  you guys tie him up

 joe and bob went to work tony
watched them suspiciously when they
were finished with the driver he ordered
them to untie the boat they did
the driver was thrown on the beach
within the shack the other mooring line
was dropped into the boat

  bob said tony git up front and
ill sit with you joes gonna drive for
his own ride


henry lacossitt

they all got in tony and
bob sat forward facing joe
joe sat behind the wheel he
turned the engine over it
was cold but he primed it and it spat
finally it caught and the boat thrashed
from side to side in its slot then it
moved slowly out gathered speed and
nosed toward canada

  out across the sullen wrinkled lake
under the ashen sky through the fine
gusty rain it flew white wings of spume
attending it

  and even now the old men in dented
derbies and drooping clothes the people
in their homes and offices the hundreds
of thousands walking the streets of the
town were reading of how joe rooker
knew that tony garotta had been on
the high level when arnold fly and
joseph stanner had been done to death
and of how tony garotta was on the run
and of how a mans home had been
snuffed out with a bomb

  flashlight picture of my feet eh
joe hot aint it bob the wife
joe the kid move over bob

  but joe only went about his business
of driving the speedboat now and
then he wiped the oozing blood from his
mouth and flung the rain from his eyes
he stared past tony garotta at the
sullen lake

  hold her straight joe until i tell
you an dont try no tricks-god its
wet

  tony pulled a bottle from his hip
drank and shuddered

  have a drink joe joe shook his
head

  you bob

  bob oleary turned away

  might sting your mug eh joe

  tony laughed boisterously

  the boat leaped across the swells of
the wrinkled lake like a joyous dolphin
they were pretty far out now away
to the left they could see the buildings
of the town great piles of illumination
shining faintly in the gloom out ahead
of them a freighter plied west probably
on its last trip before winter began to

creep down from superior and strangle
shipping

  tony took another drink he looked
at joe and then at bob oleary bob
stared back at the dreary wooded shore
directly behind them tony pushed him
in the face

  show a little life you aint got
long you too kike he swung the
open bottle at joe drops of its fiery
contents hit joe in the face

  joe wiped them away he said nothing
he held the boat straight for canada
but now and then he turned his eyes
on tony garotta and each time they
glowed with a black brilliancy tony
swung his gun idly

  how far out are they tony said
joe

  not far now joe my boy not far

  tony turned his head and looked
joe watched him

  bear a little to the left joe

  joe bore a little to the left far out
in the wet gloom beyond the freighter he
could see a dark smudge on the horizon
he looked at tony again

  that it tony

  tony turned his head and looked at
the dark smudge he tensed a little
he half rose from his seat the boat
was flying at forty miles an hour

  tony was on his feet now he rested
the barrel of the automatic on the rail
and raised his hand to shelter his eyes
from the driving rain he stepped up
on the seat bob oleary happened to
look at joe and gasped

joe with all the strength of his
fat arms wrenched the wheel
sharply to the right as far
around as it would go a
second later his round body bounced out
of the seat straight at tony garotta

  the boat swerved abruptly like a
frightened dolphin and dipped sharply
to the left as it turned tony garotta
waved his arms frantically in an effort to
keep his balance just as joes body hit
him he screamed a curse lost his gun as
he threw his arms wildly and floundered
deadline at dawn



overboard joe fell across the gunwale
bob grabbed him by the coat and pulled
him to safety

  thanks bob

  joe scurried to the wheel and turned
back toward tony

  tony paddled feebly in the icy water
the swells lifted him shook him and
flooded over him he gasped and coughed
he shuddered as the waters chill bit
him he strangled as a breaker hit
him in the face he thrashed as his
clothes grew heavy he tried to scream
but he only gurgled his broad face
was now a mask of terror

  and around him like a shark now
the speedboat moved in a slow circle

  joe had throttled the motor down
he steered the boat carefully and each
circle was smaller than the last dis-
passionately only with that terrible glow
in his eyes he watched tony garotta
struggle and bob oleary sitting
stunned looked from the floundering
figure in the water to the fat figure at
the wheel and wondered

  nearer and nearer came the boat and
more frantic grew the struggles of tony
garotta his lips were blue and his face
livid with fear and exhaustion his
glassy eyes appealed to joe as the boat
came closer joe reached in the tool
box and brought out a large wrench
he glided up to tony garotta as the
boat came by him tony threw his hands
over the gunwale but joe did not
stop he moved on slowly and smiled
at tonys fruitless efforts to climb in

  he left the wheel and kneeled to look
down into the face of tony garotta
he drew from his pocket the crumpled
sodden copy of the globe smoothed it
and held it before the terror shot eyes
beneath him he pointed to the story
that told of how a mans home had been
bombed of how the lives of a mans
wife and child had been snuffed out and
of how there were no traces-only charred
things

  his battered lips smiled a little he
suddenly wadded the sodden paper into
a ball and with a sobbing curse flung

it into the face beneath him then he
lifted the wrench and with two terrible
blows smashed the fingers that clutched
the gunwale

  tony let loose with a moaning cry
and again he thrashed and again-
although much smaller now-the speed-
boat circled but tony could not last
much longer the efforts of his arms
and broken hands began to subside

  joe brought the boat up again and
drew alongside the struggling figure
tony threw his hands over the gunwale
and clung with his palms and once
more joe left the wheel and knelt above
him for a moment he glared down
at the man beneath him

  it had been said that joe rooker had
no scruples no mercy no religion he
had little mercy but he did have scruples

  he hit tony garotta over the head
with the wrench and grabbed him by the
hair as he started to sink

  gimme a lift bob

  for the first time since joe had sent
tony overboard bob oleary moved
they dragged tony garotta aboard his
own boat

  well truss him up said joe

they took a line and tied
tonys hands and feet he
lay in the bottom of the boat
like a sack bob went forward
and sat down joe went back to the
wheel they both gazed at the man who
lay between them joes head drooped a
little he sighed wearily

  the boat rose gently on the cold swells
of the wrinkled lake the motor was
dead across the leaden reaches came
the bray of a freighter and from away
to the left came the faint shriek of
whistles the citys hymn of noon

  bob oleary looked up suddenly
he started and looked at his watch

  chees said bob what a story
an its already noon

  joe looked up then his eyes met
those of bob oleary across the inert
form of tony garotta he lifted his
round shoulders a little and looked at his


henry lacossitt

own watch then he reached into his
pocket and pulled out a damp cigar
he bit the end off absently and put the
cigar into his mouth his eyes made
little nervous twinkles

  so it is bob

  well start this thing and lets get
back to town

  high noon no deadlines for bob
oleary now and tony garotta cap-
tured captured moreover in a manner
that would make the most sensational
story in america seven hours until the
first globe deadline and the end of the day
for the press seven long beautiful hours

  joe started the engine he turned the
boat toward town he did not however
set as rapid a pace as before the boat
slid along at a fair rate parallel to the
shore about two miles out bob oleary
lost his lethargy he beat his fist against
his palm he looked up and grinned

  thisll make a swell yarn for the
final just at the rush hour his grin
became gloating how about deadline
now joe

  looks like you got the breaks bob
said joe

  thisll whip that story of yours that
you got last night wont it joe

  guess it will

  they lapsed again into silence joe
steered on a straight line they rode
for an hour a fog came down and
blanketed the dull lake it cut off the
city the boat went on blindly tony
garotta showed no signs of returning
consciousness

  better head for the coast guard
joe i can phone from there

  yeah

  ahead now a whistle blared in the mist
and a lean cloudy stream of light suffused
the gloom that was the coast guard light-
house bob o leary grew very restless

about a quarter of a mile
from the lighthouse a stone
tower which reared itself at
the end of a long breakwater-
the towns artificial harbor-the engine
of the boat suddenly raced roared vio-

lently then faded out altogether bob
looked up apprehensively joe got up
and opened the horizontal doors above
the engine the boat glided to a stop
what the hell said bob

  dont know wait a minute

  joe began to tinker with the engine
ill have it fixed in a minute bob
joe had a wrench he worked with
it a few minutes then he threw some-
thing over the side there was a tiny
splash joe threw his wrench into the
water and walked to the back of the boat
he took off his overcoat and his jacket
and vest

  what the hell you doin said bob
  gettin ready

  for what

  to go swimmin

  joe lifted the anchor weight and threw
it over then he took of his shoes

  are ya plumb nuts said bob
  no

  then what the hell are ya goin to
do

  swim to the coast guard

  what why-whats wrong with this
boat

  it wont run bob i just opened the
distributor and threw the brush into
the lake this is one time when ya
swim to a story

  joe dived bob olearys curse wa
drowned as joe went under he came
up shivering

  ill s-s-s-send s-s-s-somebody for ya
around s-s-s-seven oclock thats dead-
line

  joe made it

  he dragged his fat body up the iron
ladder of the coast guards tower and
sank a pudgy shivering mass on the
stone platform he rested a moment
then he crawled to leeward and looked
out he could see nothing of the speed-
boat through the thickening fog

  he got up and wobbled around to the
door

  there were five men in the tower they
were playing cards they resembled wax
figures when joe half fell in the door
he staggered toward a chair and might
deadline at dawn



have collapsed but they snapped out of
it and caught him

  almighty joe rooker

  hello capn said joe anything
doin

  joe- say joe ive got-

  gimme a drink first capn

  they gave him a drink of whisky taken
from a canadian rum runner joe took
two great gulps it warmed him some
one brought him steaming coffee they
tore his dripping clothes from him and
wrapped him in blankets they placed
him before an open fireplace and brought
a pan of hot water for his feet and
they gave him a cigar

  was on this tony garotta thing
capn-

  joe i read about your- say ive
got-

  an i had a boat i thought maybe
tony was tryin to lam by the lake the
boat went dead i was wettern hell any-
way and i might have been out all night
i can swim ya know

  yeah i know say joe ive got a
message for you the police reporter for
the globe told us about it when he was
callin the rounds this mornin we wrote
it down they didnt know where you
were when you left the th and theyve
been phonin all over hell for ya they
even thought of us

  joe looked at the captain quizzically
and took the message it was folded
once he opened it and read it his
tired bewhiskered face quivered as he
read and he turned away his face re-
laxed for the first time since all this
business of murder and those who com-
mitted it had claimed him and as his
face relaxed tears unrestrained rolled
down his fat cheeks he sobbed silently

  the men of the coast guard stood for
a moment and said nothing

  want to phone joe asked the
captain

  not now thanks said joe i want
to rest dont tell any reporter im here
will ya

  they let him rest he sat by the fire
he might have dozed as the afternoon

declined and the gloom outside became
thicker and the lean stream of light
circled slowly and monotonously above
he might have dozed    mrs em-
mer called tonight shes going to have a
baby

  the coast guards whistle moaned in
the mist other whistles came groaning
across the lake the rain still fine and
still gusty beat fitfully against the small
panes in the tower and not far away
blanketed by the fog bob oleary under
joes overcoat shivered and cursed and
waited while tony garotta still lay inert
and unconscious   

  youll do it wont ya honey

srtakt across the harbor the city
groped in the gloom and won-
pggb dered the press came out
i irst ancj eld jay he ther
afternoons watching it followed its lead
the cold nitrogen lamps of composing
rooms revealed clicking mechanisms set-
ting speculations and the town read
and muttered in the fine gusty rain the
day went down and the city stumbled
into dusk   

  they thought joe dozed they let
him alone as he sat huddled through the
long afternoon they let him alone and
perhaps he did doze a little but most of
the time he looked through nearly closed
eyes at the licking flames of the fire and
thought of many many deadlines
what time is it capn

  oh are you awake joe why its


  joe got up and waddled in his blankets
to the nearest phone

  city desk

  joe rooker-

 where-

  coast guard lighthouse gimme a
rewrite i got the story of tony garottas
capture

  wha- all right joe    say
joe your wife-

  ive already heard gimme the re-
write

  alrea- all right joe

  joe told his story the men of the


henry lacossitt

coast guardi sat silent and listened
joes story implied that they had a duty
to do but they stayed and listened any-
way and grinned a little joe finished
and hung up

  tonyll sure get a hot seat joe they
got his mob too you know

  yeah i know i forgot to tell ya
when i come in capn that bob oleary
and tony garotta are out there about
five hundred yards from here youd
better go get em now bobs pretty wet
and ill bet hes sore as hell- joe
laughed and it was ra little hysterical
can i go to bed

  sure joe theres cots upstairs well
give bob one too

  an youd better let the cops know
about tony now said joe

  he smiled as he waddled off in his
blankets up the circular stairway of the
tower

  the globe passed its deadline

  under the cold nitrogen lamps the
machines set not speculations but an
amazing train of facts and the globes
presses thundered triumphantly and
then from beneath great concrete shelters
trucks rumbled forth carrying the story
of tony garottas capture carrying also

the preceding events including the ac-
count of how a mans home had been
bombed and burned

  but also the globe carried the story of
how joe rookers wife and baby and
maid had left the house before it had been
bombed and burned and of how the
driver of the globes car wise in the ways
of men and methods had taken them out
of the town to the little city of elyria
some miles distant and had told no one of
where he had taken them fearing to do
so because tonys mob had been at
large but after the capture of tonys
mob and the flight of its leader according
to the globe this canny driver had in-
formed the world and the whole of the
interested world had known-all except
joe and his two companions in the speed-
boat and the two companions in the 
speedboat did not matter much in this
but joe had read all that in the newspaper
codmessage handed to him by the coast
guard his family was now on its way
safe from elyria joe could afford to
waddle off up the steps and to bed

  and the city read after its tedious and
gloomy day and marveled-and slept

  joe rooker once more had scooped the
town
pursuit

by andrew a

caffrey

a tale of the american balloon strajers

when
head-
quarters
s e p a -
rated jack langdon
from his pursuit
group and sent him
to fly two-seaters
headquarters came
very close to break-
ing a stout flying
heart for langdon
there was nothing to
do but pack and go
anything in the way
of protest would
have netted him
nothing besides
being very bad taste
nevertheless be-
tween high dudgeon
and low spirits the
boy hovered and
suffered for days

  flying chasse-
pursuit-was the
holding of all that
war could give but
piloting a two-
seater-any two-
seater was just plain
hell you would not
ask an oldfield or a
de palma to drive a
ten ton truck and
expect him to like it
would you nor
would you detail
sande to ride a me-
chanical nag well
langdon was to air
what these others

 are or were to track
 and turf and that
 thoughtless head-
 quarters should have
 known but this
 same headquarters-
 air service sos
 tours-was no re-
 specter of individu-
 als if the observa-
 tion outfits were
 short of men there
 was only one place
 to get them-from
 pursuit

  langdon when
the ax fell was at
issouduns last in-
struction field-the
combat school-
field no  an-
other day or two
and he would have
been safe

   now look here
 langdon the officer
 in charge of flying at
 no  had said when
 the boy was called
 upon the carpet and
 assigned to report at
 romorantin for de
 haviland training
 we dont want you
 to go out of this field
 tonight feeling rocky
 against us were
 not discriminating
 tours called for five
 there were only five
 of you ready to shove
 off its tough its




andrew a caffrey

rough its rotten youve put every-
thing on the ball youre an a-l chasse
flyer and the best hand with a machine
gun weve ever turned out the game
was made for you and nobody hates
worse than we do to see you leaving
pursuit

  thats all right captain langdon
had said youve been white to me
here at no  shes a bon school but-
and pin this in your hat-im not quitting
pursuit they can send me to the two-
place hacks but they cant make me do
two-place missions

  im a pursuit man and no matter
where they sink me ill still be a pursuit
flyer they can anchor me to an obser-
vation balloons cable or put me on the
business end of a shovel but as long as i
have life in me ill fight this war a la
chasse-right on the other guys tail

  late that night langdon and his four
fellow travelers detrained at romorantin
romo along with its many other things
of air was the first european home of the
american made de haviland plane
langdon had only seen one of these big
ships before-big to scout flyers that
was when lieutenant rube williamson
had flown the first dh from romo to
field 

  oh these big crates are all right i
guess rube had told the gang but a
dii is a dh and can never be a chasse
machine you know no matter how you
figure bunch a ten ton truck is a ten ton
truck and if the truth must be known
thats how these dh babies handle-like
heavy duty trucks on old rubber theyve
got lotsa power but little pep and less of
that old maneuverabitity stuff than an
otis elevator but let me tell you
cadets when the nose of this hack gets
away from you itd shame an elevator
with the cables cut whew theyre
planting them every day at romo

        at romo langdon and his
gma-tes reported for dh in-
struction

            are these dhs bad

  the instructor was fast on retort

  boy ill say theyre bad these here
culls just aint got no conscience a-tall
nohow for my own part im going to
quit air for the tank corps as a rule
when these crocks hit the sod nothings
above ground but the rudder waving like
a flag over a hole in the ice i came here
with ten friends four of them are up
there on the hill-boxed

  ten friends langdon mused as
though this had something to do with the
business at hand nobody in the
world has ten friends

  thats how it looks to you the in-
structor answered any guys that are
sent up here to fly dhs sure have no
friends and thats why you wont mind
being bumped off    anyway lets see
what you boys can do with these arks
whos who here lets get a look at your
monickers when i call your name step
stiffly to the front stand at rigid at-
tention and answer-here kind sir
lieutenant john j langdon

  on the job kind sir the new arrival
answered and im a guy as aint got
no friends

  langdon the instructor repeated
ive heard of you lieutenant-never
mind the salute werent you the bird
who flew major greene from mitchel
field clean to hazelhurst upside down
and told him that you were trying to get
a look at your landing gear-that you
thought you had blown a tire on the take-
off

  the same dizzy guy langdon said
and wasnt it strange i couldnt get a
look at those wheels and that was why i
flew the major all the way back to mitchel
in the same way upside down till id
tried it you couldnt tell me that a pilot
wouldnt see the bottom of his plane by
turning the bottom up is it not all
strange kind sir

  it sure is the instructor agreed
but lend an ear lieutenant we have a
commanding officer here who likes to ride
in dhs one of these days ill manage
to get you and him in the air in the same
ship do you begin to see light 

  thats one of my worst troubles kind
pursuit



sir my eyes take in too much light
the docs have a fancy name for it but
anyway it causes me to see-or think i
see-fun in things that strike others as
being drab for instance after that flight
at mitchel major greene said that it was
his first trip in the air

  and the records the instructor
smiled prove that it was his last now
ten years later the record still stands
after one turn of the field with langdon
on the controls the instructor gave him
an ok he simply said as he stepped
from the plane

  youre jake lieutenant but if i were
you i wouldnt land these dhs out of a
loop like that hell langdon lifes
sweet even at an observation school
come on now go on living maybe youll
get a shipment back to chasse others
have done it and the war is young you
know your air and thats no small item
but the good ones langdon are the
ones we pack in large boxes and the
other kind damn em we cant get rid of
you know there are observers here
langdon who just wont qualify
theyre afraid of the front and wont
leave romo and just so long as their
observation work is below grade we
cant ship them out whats the use
they wouldnt be worth a damn to any
squadron   

 now just a minute a mighty
thought strikes me langdon im going
to put some of these dumb johns behind
you maybe you can show them their
objective if youll fly em the way you
just flew me the front will look like an
old ladies home to the most timid of
these goldbricks oh just one more
word before you take off dont fly as
close to other planes as you flew to that
one a little while ago that was colonel
kingsley hes from tours man you
were too near

  that was all right langdon assured
the instructor i wasnt trying to pull
anything fast i just wanted to learn
something you see im accustomed to
flying rotary motors with propellers
turning at about  revs well this

liberty was doing about  revs per
minute and i just wanted to get a peek
at that other birds instrument board
it was all right his was turning the
same but  rpm seemed mighty
fast

  hell the instructor said i hope
your clock never stops or you might try
to get a peek at some other pilots wrist
watch but go ahead take off see you
later   were going to like each other
langdon

with a full tank good for
four hours flight the new dh
pilot went back into the sky
off toward vierzon at sunset
he spotted something that made his heart
glad there with about twenty thousand
feet under them was a nieuport 
patrol from field  he knew that they
were from no  because coming in close
all five nieuports revealed ship numbers
with which he was familiar all of them
were students not an instructors ship was
among the lot

  langdon felt fine he climbed on the
front mans tail broke the formation and
tried to induce the bird to go round and
round the lead man was not looking
for combat with a dh he went into a
dive and waved langdon away but the
merry one followed then with his
power running wild the retreating nieu-
port flyer burned out his rotary engine
langdon saw the propeller stop then he
leveled off and started to climb back to
the rest of the flight a man with a dead
engine is no man at all

  one of the remaining four when
langdon closed down on their rear again
deliberately killed his motor and went into
a spin the other three somewhat be-
wildered remained to mill a bit but
when langdons propeller came near to
biting chips out of one of their rudders
that nieuport also called it a day
enough is enough langdon saw the ma-
chine start down for a landing

  jack langdon had discovered some-
thing what had started as fun took on
the magnitude of worthwhile research


andrew a caffrey

he had learned that a dh rightly flown
could combat-could go round and
round-with a chasse plane

  the remaining two field no  ships
had followed their disabled mates to
earth jack langdon hung around to
make sure that five safe landings had been
made then he laughed sang a bit and
looked about for new worlds to conquer

  west of bourges he found a farman
pusher from the french school at
chateauroux it was drifting along at
eight thousand feet langdon came up
from the rear and had his left wingtip
nestled in close to the frenchmans out-
riggers before the chateauroux flyer
noticed that he was not alone then a
badly frightened face under a large crash
helmet stared wild eyed across that
short space langdons heart skipped a
beat with the shock the face under the
helmet was a boys

  you damn bully jack langdon said
to himself get thell gone from here
before you scare this game little frog to
death

  he throttled his power dropped his
right wing and slipped away from the
farman then he turned back headed
into the last rays of the sun and cut for
romo there was joy in his heart and
he was making himself all kinds of fine
promises

  these dhs he decided were not the
poorest things in the air and if a young
fellow were to apply his best talents-
well chances were he could manage to
make himself felt

  yes sir he said talking aloud
ill talk with the riggers see what they
think about washing some of the incidence
out of these wings bet with the outer
wing bays washed flat thered be no drag
and the old crate would swing around on
a dollar and that will speed her up a
lot too no question at all if we
flatten these surfaces out well add eight
to ten miles per hour what can be done
is going to be done or im a wet bird in
the meantime unless they put the screws
on me ill combat everything that flies
in this neck of the tall timber

  early the next day though they did
climb langdons frame they climbed
him twice once on account of the com-
plaint that field no  sent through from
issoudun again because of a wail that
came up from chateauroux

  i dont blame the french kid in the
hayrack farman langdon told the
officer in charge of flying upon whose
carpet he was arraigned but those
dudes from no  should hang their
heads in shame the idea of refusing
combat with a dh those five birds
should be forced to stand a court-martial
sir why not make this an issue sir

  by hell lieutenant theres food for
thought there but look here langdon-
be careful not to climb any of these two-
place sopwiths that you see fluttering
around here any sops avros or cau-
drons theyre always full of fat majors
and lean colonels to say nothing of a few
supernumerary generals of sundry ranks
and if you ride any of them the war ends
for you we have one cadet in the guard
house now he dared to come in with
a dead stick when a major was trying to
take off

  well what the hell should he have
done langdon asked stay up there
with a dead motor till the major decided
to take off

  that was the cadets problem the
officer in charge of flying stated and he
didnt get the right answer the major
gave his own ship the gun and crashed
into the cadets plane dont you work
up any problems here langdon unless
you can see the solution beforehand a
pilot in the guardhouse is no flyer at
all

 im immune sir you know how
blacksmiths and guardhouse keepers
laugh at love or something like that
well ive fallen in love with dhs thats
strange i know but its a fact me and
the dhs are getting together and were
going some place

  ill give you a push toward the front
langdon as soon as i see a chance now
get into the air and pile up as many
hours as you can thats what counts
pursuit



these forty and fifty hour pilots are not
lasting long on the front

  ive had two hundred hours sir and
im ripe for the bow all my old bunch
are fighting the battle of paris right now
and here am i poling dhs for the ever-
lasting glory of the sos the thing
aint right sir no matter how you
figure

during the day he flew dif-
ferent missions with two of the
instructors worst goldbricking
observers each time langdon
arrived over the practise objective-
neung orleans chinon blois-he would
yell back-

  do you get it

  too high the student observer
would invariably sing out and as a
rule the approach altitude would be
above fifteen thousand feet too high
lieutenant

  hold everything well fix that all
right langdon would assure the victim
then he would put the rambling dh into
a tight power spin and cut down the
altitude so fast that no rear seat ob-
server would care to be present a second
time or if he did not spin he would
execute a vertical sideslip that by rights
belonged to much smaller and trimmer
craft at any rate each man he took up
finished his observation class in one
quick lesson the unfortunate goldbrick
would come back to romo pea green
and dead eyed

  can he fly these boys who had liked
romo so well would say can he
oh hell give me air

  but no more air with langdon within
the week he had every goldbrick off the
instructors hands

  but i dont want you to get too good
langdon the instructor would warn
theyll keep you right here for dura-
tion if you do then youll have to pull
something raw to get moved for in-
stance stop rolling your wheels across the
shop roofs you think they dont see it
but the headquarters gang have been
watching you you know how they like

to be entertained dont show em any-
thing but heres good news

  ive got you lined up for a mission to
paris youre going to lead a ferrying
group close to the big town and deliver
ten dhs for front line squadrons no
you dont get a smell of the front
your mission ends when you deliver the
ferry at orly but youre going to get a
chance to oo-la-la kid

  strange but that leaves me cold
langdon replied i dont want to fight
that guerre de paree till after ive won
the right to spread my line on the
boulevards then ill strut and dont
think that i dont want to boy im
saving up for the biggest pair of chest
wings thats ever been worn on a yank
blouse and thats some big and ive
got me a swagger stick too it has a
spark plug in the end of it and a machine
gun cartridge on the tip you see im a
regulation yank all set and a-rarin to
go-when the right time comes yes sir
paris is going to sit up and rub a pair of
bleary eyes yankee doodles going to
ride right into town and on the make
too

  but how about giving me a final
lache and kicking one bon pilote toward
the promised land

  no can do right now langdon but
ill tell you what might be done if a
call for dh men comes down the line while
youre up orly way ill get a wire to you
there and have your orders sent along
if youre traveling light take your per-
sonal junk by air on the ferry trip

  ill do that langdon said the
other pair of socks wont be any kind of a
load for a dhs observation pit when
do i head this ferry

  tomorrow that is if the new planes
are all assembled by that time theyre
all on the floor in final assembly now in
the meantime be a good guy langdon
watch your step and if you run across
any issoudun nieuports spads or
morane saulniers-well snub the whole
gang whats a bunch of chasse pilots to
a guy who can do his chasse in a dh
stick to your class kid


andrew a caffrey

  damn tootin langdon said and
went out to fly-and snub everything on
wings

  at  pm the next day langdon stood
in the cockpit of the point dh of a
grounded v of ten such planes the nine
who were to follow him were to a man
of langdons type eager for anything
and anxious to get under way on this
cross country hop cross country flying
at that time rated high among the
glories that went to make the romance of
air it was all adventure impatiently
the waiting nine goosed their motors and
watched for the second when langdons
hand should fall at  the leader slid
into his seat cracked his throttle lifted
his tail and took off two by two
in an ever mounting cloud of dust
the others took up the slack filled in
on langdons rear and roared into
flight a turn of the field and the
shabby v formation went into the north
all ten did not get to orly that day
langdon watched three of the boys
make safe landings with dead or dying
motors at neuville etampes and
juvisy

  guess thats all right by me he
mused after he and the others had
circled about the unfortunate each time
those boys either had motor trouble or
they know chickens in these towns if
its motor trouble its common and un-
avoidable and if its chicken its class
and pour dhonneur dair service dame-
rique and either way or both im for
em just three little jobs for field ser-
vice and field service must have some-
thing to do

  through benefit of field service they
were all at orly next noon

  im going to hold you boys here for
a few days the commanding officer
said when they reported for return rail-
road transportation we expect to have
a flock of ships going back to romo for
repair and youre the men to ferry them
enjoy yourselves

  howre you boys fixed for francs
and the commanding officer who was
young himself once smiled

on the second day of their
lay-over orders for the front
came through for langdon and
two of his ferry mates a
roman holiday was held and the three
borrowed scout planes to celebrate
langdon flew his through the arche de
triomphe at high noon wearing a high
hat he got away with it and nothing
much was said

  but the orly flying officer reminded
him youd have rotted in prison camp
no  had things been messed up in the
place de varche de triomphe

  aint it the truth sir langdon had
agreed nowadays failure doesnt pay
yes sir a guys crazy to slip up

  tomorrow lieutenant langdon the
orly official went on you three transfers
with you in charge will ferry three of
these new dhs up to the trente-neuf
squadrons drome youll get their loca-
tion last thing before taking off its an
american group in an american sector-a
sector all bought and paid for major
john macks in charge up there boy
youre in luck-drawing a co like mack
hes one of the gang and actually flies
pilots from the front seat too and without
a second lieutenant hidden away on the
rear controls give the major a hello for
me lieutenant get the numbers on
those three ships and look em over if
you want anything around here ask for
it-and see if you get it or if you want
anything take it-and see if we care
the next day was fine it was lifes
rosiest for three willing yanks birds
were singing poppies blowing and the
skies were high and clear

  follow me langdon said

  the ferry up was without event and
the trente-neufs drome was where a
blind man could find it later langdon
and his mates were to learn that german
airmen also located the place without
much trouble

  you boys major mack said can
see the highway commissioner and take
out registration papers on those machines
you ferried up weve lost a few men in
the past week-flu you know-and it
pursuit



wont be many hours before youre out
on your own the trente-neuf welcomes
you it isnt much of a name but the
outfits top-notch also remember its
your home and a homes what you make
it-between drinks and right now and
here-no drinking boys except at mess
and between meals

  look around now get to know the
mechanics treat em right-the me-
chanics-and theyll treat you right
dont ever forget to remember that air
battles are won on the ground you
know they say a celebrity is only a dub
to his valet thats the way up here a
cocky pilot finishes fast and quick on
these strange airways i know because
ive lost several pilots in battle who were
never game enough to get out of the
weeds why to get them an enemy pilot
would have to use telepathy

  dont do anything i wouldnt do
boys and report for mess in clothes
thats all the orders we have here if
you salute me ill credit you with a gold
star if you dont salute me ill never
hold it against you this old uniform of
mine is a disgraceful affair and by all
rights does not rate a salaam go come
when youre in trouble

  the three saluted us though it were a
pleasure and went out

  if the trente-neuf is like its co
langdon said to his flying mates this
dumps going to be a home guess we
can work here

  for anybody looking for work the
place could supply the limit having
heard that the air branch was the eyes
of the army the artillery infantry-and
even the medical corps through force of
bad habit-were incessantly asking for
observations they did not care much
what was observed but they liked to
keep the air service in hot water these
old line branches know how easy it is to
loaf when it rains or the fog gets too
heavy so they figure that being the
highest branch of the service aviation
should do its stuff while others sleep
and the young branch extending itself to
the limit made those observations flew

when flying was out of the question and
sacrificed men when men were scarce

that evening by low candles
in the trente-neufs mess
langdon and his two mates
met the outfit except for one
it was easy to know that one lieu-
tenant charles mudd ffv as
u s r was hard for langdon to meet
because he had met him before

  ffv mudd and langdon had both
been assigned to the th aero squadron
for shipment overseas together at
mitchel field they had reported in to the
ths old top-kick sergeant benton
and upon reporting when the loths co
was absent the old man had had them
sign the register langdon had signed
first and in a self-conscious way

  put down your rank lieutenant
sergeant dad benton had said theres
no misters in this mans army put down
your lieutenant first and your as
usr 

  next lieutenant mudd signed but
first he found a resting place for his
swagger stick and deposited his gold
tipped cigaret on the edge of dads
blotter and when that baby signed he
signed-and how

  first lieutenant charles surrv mudd
ffv as usr

  what the hells all this ffv
stuff the old sergeant quizzed

  that suh is first families of
virginia lieutenant charles surry
mudd answered

  of course his tone of voice was the
tone that should be used when a lieu-
tenant speaks to an enlisted man and
it went just about as far as the talk of a
lieutenant usually goes with an enlisted
man the old sergeant with a stroke of
the broad pen struck out the ffv

  there are no ffvs in this mans
army lieutenant mudd

 lieutenant charles surry mudd
stepped back his pale face grew even
paler the sensitive lips and chin
quivered and the flesh above his knees
prickled within their well tailored con-


andrew a caffrey

fines his breath came hard his eyes
flooded then the proud youth fell to
chewing his lower lip the army un-
couth thing that it is had taken him for
another ride

  finally deciding against mixing with
a lowly sergeant lieutenant mudd re-
trieved his swagger stick and cigaret and
strode to the door he hesitated upon
the threshold long enough to say-

   ill report this sawgent

  report and be damned the old top-
kick mused and closed the register

  more than a quarter of a century in the
service of uncle sam had placed sergeant
dad benton in a position where lieu-
tenants and even higher rankers were
of no more importance than the most
lowly th aero buck with the ever ex-
panding bubble that was the war of 
wise heads of dads caliber were only too
few newly made captains suddenly
advanced majors and dizzy colonels came
hurriedly into the old mans council to
ascertain just what gentlemen of their
rank should do under this that and the
other condition and they got their
answers

  youll find the answer to that
sir the old man would say after twist-
ing his long mustaches for maybe as much
as ten seconds on page so and so
paragraph this or that in your blue
book

  and how any man even in twenty-
seven years could memorize-page and
paragraph-as large a volume as army
regulations is beyond the understanding
of one who could never remember which
of two was the right foot

  so you can see first lieutenant
charles surry mudds report if made
caused no ripple on the already troubled
waters of mitchel field and mudds
report very likely was turned in be-
cause in the several weeks of his stay
with the th the lieutenant was hard
to get along with he wanted salutes
from the enlisted men enlisted men
though seldom salute those who fail to
command their spontaneous respect and
mudd was out of luck

   shortly after the loths arrival upon an
active field in france a plane crew sent
mudd into the air with an almost empty
gasoline tank two flying-wire tum-
buckles unsafetied and a landing gear
wheel loosed and ready to fall off when
the motor died at five thousand feet
mudd came down for a landing when he
hit the ground the right wheel bounced
through his lower off-side wing and went
places the small pursuit plane a
nieuport  with one wheel missing
somersaulted three times by the count
and mudd came up from the wreckage
like an angry hen from a messed up nest
shades of southern hospitality and
gentility what a yell went up

  however the th aero was a good
outfit it was also a mighty useful outfit
and had an important top sergeant in its
orderly room

  the whole damn affair must have
been just an accident dad benton con-
vinced the benzine board appointed to
smell into mudds rotten charges why
these th boys are worked to death
sixty-odd pursuit planes in the air for
five periods a day of course now
and then something is going to go
wrong

  the benzine board made its report
headquarters made a move mudd was
the pawn and because the th gang
ran with every other gang at issouduns
many fields headquarters made the
move big enough to put mudd out of
danger for all time he first lieuten-
ant charles surry mudd ffv was sent
to observation away from issoudun

now with the trente-neuf
langdon and mudd were in the
same outfit once again

  how are they breaking
ffv langdon asked 

  mudd gazed through langdon and
went to his place at table a quiver of
anticipation went through the room
and that told langdon that lieutenant
mudd had not changed one whit

  youll remember lieutenant lang-
don mudd said when he was seated my
pursuit



army salutation is lieutenant mudd
the hell you tell langdon smiled
where at is your ffv charles
mudd gave his attention to the meal
the table tried hard to smother its
mirth and langdon explained-

  lieutenant mudd and i made our
transport with the same outfit attached
to the th aero-

  the swine mudd snarled

  the best damn air unit in france
langdon said that is with the ex-
ception of the trente-neuf

  thats the spirit lieutenant lang-
don major mack cheered from his end
of the long table the old outfit is al-
ways good but the new outfit to be an
outfit must always be the outfit   
stand devils- to the trente-neuf
this trente-neuf a man at lang-
dons right said after the toast is a jake
outfit langdon theres only one thing
wrong with it

  he stopped talking and stared at mudd
there was only one thing wrong with
the th langdon told the man and
it was the same thing an outfits mis-
takes are its own and the unpardonable
mistake is the mistake made when an
outfit makes the mistake of not rectifying
its mistakes am i right

  no mistake the other agreed

  next morning langdon went out on his
first mission behind mudd that is be-
cause of seniority ffv was in the front
plane of a three ship flight now this
thing of following ffv mudd was not
the worst medicine on earth and langdon
had no kick coming mudd was a flying
man and that seems strange none
no matter what his idea of manhood
could ever deny mudd his place in air
and for more than two months now he
had been taking missions out and what
was more important he was bringing
them back maybe that was why the
trente-neuf had not taken steps to
clean up this one mistake

  mudd was one of those conscientious
flight leaders who gave flying orders like
a pedagogue and then expected every
man to do his duty there was no fun

to be found behind him the objective
was the objective and not fun his unit
took no long chances if enemy planes
were above mudd toured all france on
their four hour dh tanks then came
back came back got the pictures or
observations and went hell bent for
home a pilot might just as well have
been touring france with the y and
on more than one occasion he had been
told so but not by major mack no
matter what the major might have
thought personally he stood firmly be-
hind mudd because of results shown
the business of an observation squadron
is observation let the pursuit groups do
the combat stuff

  this first front line flight of langdons
was the quietest thing imaginable not
an enemy craft crossed their skies he
wondered where these comebacks from
the front got all their stuff about dog
fights painted circuses and german
infested ceilings and as he followed
mudd above territory that should have
been bad he recalled what rube william-
son had told them back at issoudun

  hun planes never saw a single hun
plane in two weeks flying maybe
theyre there for some but they were not
there for me and now they were not
there for langdon

  at the end of the eastward mission
mudd with the observations on the cuff
signaled for a turn and back home push
then for about ten minutes langdon
kept the other two planes close in where
they belonged and began to look about
to see what he could see they came
above a road that was jammed with the
properties of germanys late summer try
without a great deal of thought langdon
parted company dropped down from
mudds six thousand feet elevation and
went to strafing the enemy activities

it was fun it was war it
was more like it he turned
to his observer-a lieutenant
akeley-and winked akeley
stood up on his stool bent over lang-
dons shoulder and yelled


andrew a caffrey

  go back and give em hell when
you come in above that little burg where
they were eating-where all the smoke
was-sideslip and let me get a crack at
em with my gun hop to it

  langdon looked for his two com-
panion planes mudd and the other had
gone ahead for a moment he might have
hesitated this thing of pulling a private
strafe while detailed on a mission would
not be considered exactly good but
being a strong youth langdon weakened
he flew a turn and went back along the
german supply road

  where he found the field kitchens
smoking langdon climbed to about five
hundred feet from that altitude with
the nose of his plane high he slipped right
and gave akeley his chance with the rear
gun at the same time watching his
slip he also watched akeley and cheered
the gunner above the roar of slipping
struts and wires at a hundred feet or
less he kicked out of the slip redressed
his ship whaled full motor to the craft
and flew across the concentration of
troops-and through a hail of rifle fire
   akeley went back to the trente-
neuf a corpse in langdons rear pit

  at sunset jack langdon sat upon his
heels before a hangar smoked and tried
to figure out the whole thing within the
hangar at his back under a tarpaulin was
the quiet akeley a short distance away
where the suns light was yet available
trente-neuf mechanics worked at patch-
ing thirty-seven holes in langdons dh
the mechanics talked and wondered why
that new bird langdon did not get
bumped too

  within his quarters till the evenings
dusk gave way to dark lieutenant mudd
martinet at heart worked assidously
upon his report he missed supper in its
completion then with the several pages
in hand the conscientious one straight-
ened his blouse put a rag to his boots
strapped on his sam browne and went
toward major macks room on the
way lieutenant charles surry mudd
detoured only once and this detour sent
him past the enlisted mens quarters

where the longers were forced to snap into
it and deliver the salute

  too bad lieutenant mudd mack
said as he received the report hell i
liked akeley well miss him the
whole trente-neuf will miss his mandolin
of evenings

 it was murder mudd snarled
this man langdon- it was murder
sir

  but sergeant rictor- the armorer
of the trente-neuf-reported that bob
had fired several hundred rounds his
gun was still warm when lieutenant
langdon returned major mack pro-
tested and you know bob akeley
lieutenant if he had a chance to go out
like that in action why the boy was at a
feast with a fork in each hand

  this glorification of personal thrill was
not for mudd wordless white and
a-tremble he weaved on the threshold and
tried again and again for words in the
end he said

  you have my full report sir a flight
leader must have unbending discipline
sir

 major mack walked toward the
window then because there was noth-
ing else he could do he walked back

  lieutenant mudd he said send
lieutenant langdon to me

  major mack was still pacing when
langdon knocked came in and reported
the major eyed the pilot and paced once
more to the east window then he paced
back and eyed langdon once more

  what have you got to say lieu-
tenant the superior finally asked

  not a word sir langdon fought
hard to swallow his grief i know ive
pulled a star boner guess ive had my
war-been hired fed and fired all in a
day sir

  whose idea was it langdon

  mine sir as yet i cant always re-
member that i have another man behind
me observers werent in my first
schooling sir

  even if the thing were excusable
lieutenant you should have asked akeley
what he thought of the plan
pursuit



  yes sir

  maybe you did

  no sir i just got the idea that i
could do damage on that road so i
shoved down the nose and went then
we got together akeley and i he said-
 go back and give em hell and we
went

  i thought that was it major mack
smiled langdon ever since bob akeley
came to this squadron at least twice a
day hes been in here trying to talk me
into turning the squadron to pursuit
of course we cant sanction such doings
langdon and for my own part i
wouldnt pull such a strafe no im a
little too old and slow on the controls
you see i like to have a little more
space between my wheels and the ground
but im not so old as to be unable to ap-
preciate the finesse of the thing and
lieutenant if we could roll back time
and circumstance would place langdon
in macks place and mack in lang-
dons- well that road would have
been strafed today maybe not as good
but after a fashion at least

now lieutenant im
neither going to call out a
firing squad nor mark you on
the ground between you and
me aviation as the eyes of artillery
doesnt carry even the weight of a good
joke im an old artillerist myself
langdon and i know so if we can wage
any kind of a war of our own im not go-
ing to stand in the way of progress you
understand langdon i am not author-
izing sanctioning or legalizing future side
trips but in your own right you are in
command of one ship while off the ground
orders the best orders ever made were
only made to be broken and so long as
they are broken without going into the
red when its all over theres no kick
coming in other and fewer words-be
sure youre right then go ahead and
dont slip up the quick are always
right in war langdon but it is far
better that the quick be dead than be
wrong

  now theres one observer in the
trente-neuf with whom i want you to
become well acquainted it is lieutenant
samter samter during such times as
bob akeley wasnt pestering me has
spent much wind trying to show me where
and how this outfit might run up a big
record in combat victories hes of the
opinion that an observer should only ob-
serve when theres no fighting to be done
and he can do things with that rear
machine gun langdon sergeant rictor
tells me that samter has shown him more
trick stuff than hes ever seen before
and sergeant rictor has been an armorer
for upward of fifteen years if you and
samter find that you have much in com-
mon come to me and well talk it over
no reason at all why he shouldnt hold
down your rear stool on all flights   
english fags they are take a couple
with you lieutenant

  late into that night langdon and
samter talked and they discovered that
they had just about everything in com-
mon including a rotten opinion of one
charles surry mudd ffy lieutenant
samter had been riding behind mudd a
great deal of late and the war had lost
its flavor

  id rather hold on to the rear saddle
of a motorbike with an enlisted stiff
chewing hard on the handlebars he told
langdon all of the white haired boys
good flying is wasted and ill say old
ffv can pilot but whats the use of
being behind him-just going the route
delivering the milk and coming home
theres more thrill working at kitchen
police where you have the ever present
danger of cutting your finger while paring
spuds eh

  sure langdon agreed the co
gave me these cigs theyre english
aint they rotten what

  i wouldnt walk a mile samter
answered unless it was to get away from
such smokes

  the next day it rained and the new
team worked ship langdon and the
trente-neufs head rigger washed out
the outer bays of all four wings also


andrew a caffrey

they took out one of each pair of outside
flying wires

  they dont need all these wires the
rigger agreed each one of these cables
has a breaking strength of more than two
thousand pounds when would you ever
get such a load on a wing same way
with the landing gear you know how to
set these babies down lieutenant i
watched you when you brought akeley
in yesterday you wouldnt have broken
an egg so well pull out all the extras
and that will help to speed the crate
up too

  well do some streamlining on her
too im glad to get a chance to see
what can be done about pepping up a
dh i always argued that something
could be done they aint such dead
culls theyll maneuver if youll help
em

  samter and rictor put hour after
hour on the two guns that dh had
surely fallen into good hands toward
the end of day they flushed the water
radiator drained the old and refilled
with new motor oil cleaned ignition
heads and the ship was set then
they prayed for a morrow full of flying
weather

  next morning september the twenty-
third langdon and samter mooched
their way into a real melee above the
road from la harazee where the th
division was convoying guns through to
the bois des hautes batis that fight by
rights belonged to the pursuit gang it
was no place for a dh but when
langdon and samter pulled out they had
done damage enough to justify a bid for
confirmation on two enemy planes their
ship had been hit seven times and
samter once but his was just a minor
rap only a little job for the squadron
doctor

on the day following the
two wild men accounted for
three of eight german observ a-
tion balloons that had hung
above the main road through the vesle
and langdon and samter were beginning

 their traditional climb toward lasting air
 fame

   on october the thirteenth divisional
 headquarters called for a rock bound veri-
 fication on all observations covering that
 tough stretch of road between grand pre
 and st juvin it had been a hard line to
 bend-that german stronghold along
 the northern bank of the aire but now
 one way or the other it was not only
 going to be bent but broken-and com-
 pletely

   mudd with four following ships and
 covered from above by twelve pursuit
 planes went out to do the job they
 were nearly above grand pre before
 hell broke loose and they were past
 st juvin and making a turnabout before
 the first hun ship broke the high de-
 fense and took a dh off the trente-
 neufs rear

   with his remaining three stiff lipped
 and obstinate mudd flew his turn and
 went down the st juvin-grand pre line
 for a return whirl then a second dh
 fell and langdon broke out with combat
 quit formation and won another boche
 ship from the milling group

   lieutenant charles surry mudd
 worked long and late upon another re-
 port then major mack paced late and
 long into the night and tried hard to be a
 good fellow and at the same time a good
 soldier which is a thing well nigh im-
 possible in the end he called all six
 who had returned all of mudds five
 companions including mudds own ob-
 server swore by all that might have been
 holy that langdon in quitting forma-
 tion and taking on combat had only done
 so to cover the successful retreat of the
 camera planes and charles surry
 ffv went into the night talking to
 himself and kicking stones that war
 was a war for him

   langdon and samter listening to the
 guns that were pouring it into grand pre
 and the road to the east waited im-
 patiently for the morrow

   this damn swagger stick dude of a
 muddy mudd samter said from his
 shakedown if the simple minded simp-
pursuit



 ering juvenile does anything more to tear
 down our meat house jack ill work
 him over with a prop wrench on my own

 make one more report to the old man
 and ill land on him so hard that his
 brains if any will detonate and blow
 some he-man color into his insipid
 map

 ffv-far from vodka finest
fish vender faint falsetto voice-ill
ffv the white haired white livered
rat

 check - a madman langdon
laughed roll over samter and tear
off some sleep charles ffv is the
least of our many worries and hes a
good enough gun one wing the only
thing is you and i are fighting a different
war on the level mudds scrap is
gamer than ours his is an impersonal
guerre and he doesnt even keep a
diary

  a good drunk is what mudd needs
samter decided a trip to town a big
town a good drunk and-

  thats a two or three motored ship
and shes mighty close langdon said
as they caught the throb and pump of a
night flyer wish we were doing night
missions too

  ambitious guy samter said to his
inflated pillow when would mudd
find time to write lengthy reports

  it really doesnt make much differ-
ence langdon said to his blanket
because nobody ever reads them any-
way

  during the following days as the line
pushed up through champigneulle st
georges alliepont and on to verpel the
two wild men for the greater part went
it alone major mack heard mudds
bleat often but the major was too busy to
bother himself with such minor dis-
tractions this war was what men like
mack had lived a life for mudd could
not be expected to see this and mack
made no effort toward proselyting ffvs
conversion to the cause of langdon
samter-and if the truth must be
known mack

the major was on the wing
a great deal during those busy
days with his own eyes he
saw langdon knock an enemy
craft out of the skies behind buzancy
and follow a second out of sight toward
stonne and the meuse

  yes sir major mack told mudd
upon his return to the drome that
heller of a langdon went down on a
fokker and when the hun fell into a
spin after langdons first burst the kid
sideslipped right with him and samter
poured his load from the rear gun they
had the poor devil burning through the
last two thousand feet the second
plane they picked on was doing obser-
vations near harricourt

  but its not consistent sir lieu-
tenant mudd insisted

  but hell lieutenant mack said
it is strictly american you know and
when we take this out of the yank
youth were eternally lost

  so major mack continued to make
allowances for one of his planes which had
no more right in an observation outfit
than has a free balloon in a pursuit
squadron

  on the third of november langdon
got a german ship which was busily
strafing roads near authe and on the
fourth he accounted for a like worker
near oches

  the damn gorillas-strafing our
troops he said to samter as they re-
gassed their ship at ten oclock that
morning

  then reserviced the two went di-
rectly into the air and strafed roads as far
back as la neuville and raucourt

  in his own way mudd was making
history through the long hours of those
crowded days time and again even
with his overhead defense shot to pieces
he made requested observations along the
meuse he located ambushes near
la bessage and le vivier and dropped
warning notes to the infantry on a hill
above a graveyard in raucourt there was
a machine gun and anti-aircraft nest
mudd wiped it out twice in four days


andrew a caffrey

he brought dead observers home in his
rear pit and on one of those trips he
had landed his burning plane on the long
hillside slope before champigneulle

  but why the hell doesnt he stay and
fight samter argued every slug hole
in his linen is frayed to the front dead
observers are of no use to anybody
theyre not worth a dollar a thousand
   langdon if i ever see a slug coming
into the rear of your crate ill spray you
with my own gun just to teach you a
lesson

   and ill pile you up surern hell if you
do langdon promised

   there was no freebooting on the seventh
artillery and infantry wanted to learn
all there was to be known of the bridges
on and the terrain adjacent the meuse
headquarters told the trente-neuf to
go get it and behind mudd langdon
and four other pilots-three of them
green-took off

  at villers devant mouzon a detach-
ment of engineers were doing their best
to throw a path across the meuse the
german machine gun nests and snipers
were making of the job a nasty detail
till mudds flight put an end to those
ambushes

  at remilly a like detachment was
having a still harder time and the
covering aerial defense was no enviable
task before the first four hour patrol
had ended two of mudds new men had
limped back to the drome with motor
trouble and one had been driven down a
few kilometers east of the river by an
enemy pursuit plane mudd and lang-
don close at hand had seen that trente-
neuf pilot burn his ship before he was
taken prisoner by ground troops then
still behind the lines the two had turned
back toward the river

  there was a heavy sky that day
november  and anything in the way of
altitude had been out of the question
but now here and there the blue was
breaking through and showing a higher
ceiling suddenly out of this clearer sky
a bi-motored enemy craft crossed their line
of flight langdon jumped it after a

few seconds of thought outclassed by the
faster yank the enemy ship turned east
and the eager langdon hung on mudd
after a moment followed samter as
langdon came down on the big ships
tail again thumped langdon on the
back and pointed to mudd

  old ffv himself samter yelled
hes going to pile on with us now
there will be a war

  but war and a personal battle were not
mudds concerns coming east from the
meuse he had spotted two hun pursuit
planes that had seen langdon and the
bomber

  mudd was pretty well off to the
south and the pair of single-seater
germans came down on langdon before
he could work into position with the
first burst of lead samter crumpled shot
through both legs he fought to stay
clinging tenaciously to his machine gun
mount he pulled a belt from his flying
suit passed it through and around the gun
scarf and worked his way to a standing
position langdon had dived and slipped
now he zoomed and flew a wing-over
they came back under the pursuing
planes-and samter got one as they went

by-

  in a moment langdon was crowding
down on the bomber and single pursuit
ship again and just when he came into
position his gun jammed the german
seemed to realize his predicament they
passed the laugh from ship to ship that
was a mistake on their part it made
langdon angry

the speed of the chase was
the speed of the big ship out
front the combat plane easily
maintained a position between
the pursuing dh and the huge german
thus further increasing langdons rage

  for a few minutes as they flew in line
the american thought hard then he
gained a little altitude and with it under
him he threw full power to his motor
went into a long dive and closed the
distance between him and the pursuit
plane before the german knew what
pursuit



was up langdon had hooked his left
lower wingtip into the right side of the
lighter craft the latters single inter-
wing n-strut came out and half his
lower wing went with it that pilot was
finished with the war

  but langdons ship could not go
through such a high speed collision with-
out damage he had counted on losing a
few feet of wingtip if only that much
were wiped off a pilot could carry the
difference of lateral stability by using full
rudder on the opposite side from the
wing so damaged also the use of aileron
would help offset the loss of wing lift
but he had lost more than was good for
the wing balance of any plane he was
in a bad situation

  they had crashed at five thousand feet
fighting to hold up the clipped lower left
wing he flew a flat turn to the right
covered a great deal of space and started
back for the meuse but even with full
right rudder and his control stick clear
to the side he was losing altitude he
had to lose altitude in order to remain
at all level two or three times in the
following five minutes he came very
close to falling into a spin each time
he dived gained high speed and fought
the craft out of its wing drag

  here and there along the chiers river
the anti-aircraft outfits were sending up
feelers for langdon even the machine-
gun crews were putting steel through his
ship as he crossed the highest spots

  finally he had mairy just ahead and
off to the right it looked as though he
would come to earth and pile up some
place between the town and the meuse
and as yet the east bank of the river was
in enemy hands the war was just about
over for two willing young men and   

  langdon had been watching mairy to
his right all of a sudden the weight
came off his weak left side he stared
full of bewilderment for mudds right
wings were tucked under his damaged
panels and carrying the load that for
langdon and samter was the grandest
moment of life

  both motors now roared full on they

lost no more altitude and the river be-
came more than just a possibility

  samter still hanging on his belt shook
his head and fainted langdon made
sure that it was lieutenant charles
ffv shook his head and tended
strictly to his flying the meuse came
closer and archie came up oftener the
war was as good as over for the enemy
but they still had a goodly amount of
ammunition on hand and they were
throwing most of it toward langdon and
mudd but that did not worry langdon
now the river was only a matter of
short kilometers soon ffv would be
working on his report

  and hes got me with my suspenders
cut langdon found time to reflect
hell who ever heard of such a dumb
thing as an intentional collision on the
wing collisions are strictly for high
rankers and to be made only upon takeoff
and landing

  theyll ground me for this sure i
might even draw a bobtail and old kid
charlie mudd   

  as suddenly as he had arrived mudd
left a rifle shot from the east bank of
the meuse had found him his plane
with dead hands and feet on the controls
spun into the river

ofrm the dressing station
where langdon sat richly
swathed in iodine soaked wrap-
pings he could watch the en-
gineers fishing for a pilot and observer
where the rudder of a plane waved above
the surface of the meuse on a cot where
a few medical men had been busy for an
hour samter was showing the first signs
of returning consciousness now and then
the observer had said in delirium
ffv old ffv himself

  we used to have one of them in this
corps a medical private said he was
from norfolk i think that ffv stuff
stands for first families of virginia
right you are langdon mused
from where he sat

  wrong as hell samter mused it
stands for fell flying valiantly

           by harry g huse

     dry land dawson hitches his
     wagon to a star-in hollywood

we spoke of furrow drills
and two man combines of
ed hyatts new pure bred
milking shorthorn bull and
of limpy bucklins boy-the lazy left
handed one that was back from the east
from st joe it was or perhaps omaha
with pointed sideburns and a chiroprac-
tors license

  jest wrastles your backbone said
dry land and cures whatevers the
matter of you from long standing salt
rheum to fresh carbuncles and bone
felons

  in time we came by way of a recent
wedding-orange blossoms growed from

a slip according to the old homesteader
whose native delicacy shrank from the
current explanation of the affair-to the
neighborhoods lighter social activities
and that topic of perennial interest-the
past years quota of new school teachers
their labors and their triumphs in these
fallow montana fields

  generally on the occasion of your
visits said dry land casting a handful
of sal soda into the dishwater i have
been able to mingle a little high toned
romance with my accounts of life as now
lived on these here western plains

  he paused to test the steaming water
with a gnarled and knowing index finger


the four horsemen



then reached for the tin dipper in the
bucket beside him

  in times past as i say he continued
mildly i have generally been able to en-
liven our conversation by supplying a
ringside blow by blow account of the
major engagements from the time the
party-line subscribers hear the new school-
maam has just been drove into the yard
and is gitting down out of the county
superintendents ford coup and has got
a shingle bob and is wearing a mulberry
sport ensembley with shorter skirts and
more rouge than last years down to the
closing exercises in the spring and the
fancy towel and kitchen tinware showers
that precedes the june nooptials

  he broke off to sigh profoundly and
point out the dishtowels on an ingenious
rack behind the kitchen range

  this year however i am able to pro-
vide only the bare statistics that five
out of a possible eight was success-
ful and that four former single men
and one sod widower are now having
to scrape their feet at the kitchen door
and keep their shoes on evenings and
are otherwise being domestically looked
after

  had he i asked strangely lost his
flair for the social contacts of the wheat
benches or been crippled with rheuma-
tism or something

  absent he explained simply roam-
ing far afield as the feller says observ-
ing human nature and its didoes in other
climes cutting a few capers my own
self for the amusement and edification of
the masses

  helena and the state legislature i
suggested

  worse he replied california the
land of everlasting sunshine cafeterias
ford seedans glass bottomed boats horse-
shoe pitching matches and state picnics
hollywood california-and the moving
pitchers

  he fell silent engrossed with his shame
and a blackened skillet

  a wasted winter he mused or at
any rate almost wasted a sacrifice laid
on the altar of old time friendship a

dreary round as the feller says of sophis-
ticated pleasures

  he shook his head lugubriously above
the clashing kitchen ware only the lift
of his shoulders and the mellow gleam in
his faded blue eyes belied his air of melan-
choly

  i have always held strong sentiments
began the old homesteader when we were
tilted back against the whitewashed
cottonwood logs outside watching night
deepen in the distant highwoods agin
the tendency of tired agerculturists to end
their days dry rotting in what is termed
the golden state

it has been my pride since
them doleful days of  when
the open range went the way of
the buffalo and injun and
roundups begun to be held in ball parks
to have been able to stand out agin the
lure of sun kissed bungalows bathing
beauties and new real estate subdivisions
and to have kept mind and body soople
trying to raise wheat where it still aint
any too certain that the almighty in-
tended wheat should be raised

  in them sad days to which i have
referred when the dry landers was coming
in by trainloads and you couldnt ride a
mile in any direction without hitting a
new barb wire fence it become necessary
for me to bid farewell to a roan cow horse
and a low fork rim fire saddle that hadnt
their equal north of the missouri and
also to one of the homeliest hardest
riding unluckiest poker playing human
friends a man ever had

  his name was gentry-orville o
gentry-and he had sandy red hair and a
snub nose and would have stood about
five foot three in his stocking feet if it
hadnt been agin one of his principles to
wear socks during the days of his free-
dom when he was riding range and pass-
ing his earnings freely to one and all
across a pegged out blanket he was
knowed familiarly as bobtail-from his
small size and the brand of flushes he gen-
erally held then one spring he got
dyspeptic and lonely and sentimental


harry g huse

and married the widow bannister that
lie was working for as foreman after
that he was orville to the widow and
double o to the half dozen other suitors
that had their eyes on her badger butte
ranch

  with the coming of so many dry
landers anybody that used his head for
anything besides plumping out the sweat-
band of a stetson could see the end of the
cattle business the widow whod
always had horse sense sold out while
there was still a market for her place and
set to work gentling orville up to the idea
of pulling out for california theyd got
enough now and more too she pointed
out to keep them comfortable if they
didnt go into high society which wasnt
likely orville being too fond of chewing
tobacco and having them prejudices agin
white collars and socks

  orville put up a good fight and held
out agin the proposition as long as he
was able hell he said hed ruther stay
here and herd sheep he wouldnt even
be able to do that the widow showed him
from now on there wasnt going to be
nothing herded around here but jack-
rabbit breaking plows and that kind of
work was going to be hard on a little
sawed off feller with high heeled boots
and bowlegs

  he put up a good battle all things
considered when it become evident the
widowd had her mind made up all along
and was jest giving him rope to make
him feel manly and independent he weak-
ened and said hed go if id go too the
widow suggested that being to home with
livestock the two of us might like to go
into the white leghorn chicken business

  bobtail pleaded with me something
desperate i admit i was tempted spite
of his having got married him and me
was still thickern a pair of cattle rustlers
and we didnt see how we was going to
git along without each other but id
got my dander up listening to all the
croakers saying the ruination of the coun-
try was in sight and that a cattleman
couldnt make a go of it wheat farming
id already filed on the best half section in

the county and was reading dry farming
bulletins and taking practise lessons git-
ting around on my own two feet instead
of a horses four it was a sad situation
there was days of indecision and nights
of anguish as the song feller says but in
the end i stuck to montana and bobtail
and me said a sad farewell and our des-
tinies was parted

  we corresponded regular during all
the time of our separation writing on the
average of once a year like a couple of
fellers will we lied to each other purty
heavy bobtails gone into the real
estate and insurance business in a small
way to keep hisself busy he makes out
like hes having a big time sashaying
around amongst the orange groves and
oil wells in a automobile the widows
bought and going to theaters nights
and looking at the purty girls and drink-
ing tony liquor i do considerable brag-
ging about the forty bushel crops im
raising and about having become a leader
in the gay social life that springs up
among the new settlers

  he keeps threatening to visit me and
i threaten to visit him but we dont
neither of us ever git around to it the
widows keeping a firm rein on him i
guess and fars im concerned what with
drouth and being hailed out and having
my wheat winter-kill i got all i can do to
keep one jump ahead of my mortgages

it runs on like that until
late last summer then i git a
letter from bobtail that sounds
real low and unhappy hes
had about all he can stand he says him
and the widow have made more money
than theyll ever need in real estate with-
out hardly lifting a finger and lifes got
to be nothing but sleeping on a coil spring
bed and riding around at twenty miles
an hour on concrete roads where you
couldnt find a bump in a hunderd miles
and bragging about the weather and git-
ting dragged to moving pitcher shows
where the stars appear in person and tell
how good they are in voices that sound like
they got their mouths full of hot mush
the four horsemen



  hed like to git away and come see
me but being a married man he cant
leave the widow anyway he says he
guesses it would make him feel lower and
more despondent to see the old range
messed up with farmers and all the land-
marks covered up with growing wheat
he hints in his letter hes so gloomy he
may decide to end all if i dont value
our old-time friendship enough to come
down and spend the winter with him

  his letter strikes me during a moment
of weakness im harvesting a good crop
and feeling a little jaundiced from eating
too much of my own cooking and facing
the job of rebanking my house and gitting
new winter underwear if im going to
stay here during the cold weather i give
the matter as careful thought as im able
being warmed up and made sentimental
by the low feeling plea in bobtails letter
and first thing i know ive wrote him
ill come and am gitting my old ford
tinkered up for the long trip

  i will pass over lightly the hardships
of my journey theres a lot of moun-
tains between here and hollywood for a
man thats driving a  ford and aint
never felt to home in it like he would back
of a team of horses i must have bailed
half the cricks this side of the mountains
dry keeping water in my radiator climb-
ing up over the continental divide and
i et heavily into the visible supply of
brake bands on the other side going down
id got me a camping outfit and the nights
was cold enough to make a man feel lone-
some and homesick the season was
late and there wasnt hardly nobody in
the tourist camps to visit with

  it wasnt until i got over into utah
that i run into what you might call a
congenial human being his name was
fillow-alonzo b fillow-but right away
he asked me to call him lon which was
what hed gone by back in idaho before
they cut the sagebrush and ruined the
country

  he was a long thin feller kind of bent
in the middle like it was from stooping
down to be able to hear what average size
people was saying hed been born and

raised on a snake river ranch and was a
saddle maker by trade hed knowed
lean days when irrigation come in and
for a while had had to turn his hand he
said to bartending that went back on
him too when prohibition come in and
hed have been on the county sure he
reckoned if the movies and the rodeos
and the dude ranches hadnt opened up a
big new market for his handiwork as it
was hed gone back to his trade and made
big money making saddles and chaps and
leather cuffs for the growing army of
part time cowboys

  hes done so well hes retired and is
now on his way agin his better judgment
to spend the winter with his daughter in
los angeles

  lons camping along same as me with
an outfit hes got out of a mail order cata-
log and he complains likewise about the
cold nights so we team up and bunk
together

  its a one sided arrangement there
not being much warmth in one of these
thin fellers and that bend in his middle
taking up a lot of room in bed no matter
which way its pointed but hes been
mellowed by lifes trials and tribulations
as the feller says and he sure knows how
to visit we hold the same views on
important subjects like horse liniment for
rheumatism and sleeping in your under-
wear and a chew of tobacco in bed before
gitting up in the morning and time were
across the desert and down through cali-
fornia seems like weve knowed each
other for the last twenty years

  we exchange addresses our last night
together and promise to look each other
up after we git settled and say goodby
the next morning with many a parting
pang of genuine regret

  well i found bobtail a changed and
almost ruined man if i hadnt arrived
at his place in an overhet condition from
trying to figger out red and green lights
and watch street signs and being spoke to
rough by other drivers and policemen i
sure would have been took right off my
feet by the deterioration thats took place
in orville it aint so much the things


harry g huse

that are visible to the naked eye though
they are plenty like his being bald all
but a ring of red hair that looks like a
halo busted in half and pushed down
on to his ears and a little pussy stomach
swelling out his vest and wearing baggy
boys pants with fancy colored checkered
stockings its other things like a nerv-
ous way hes got of fussing about trifles
and a useless kind of a look in his eyes

we aint no more than
shook hands before he starts
worrying about gitting my
ford in off the street and hid
away in his garage you couldnt blame
him much because the ford was party
dusty and i had most of the camping
outfit tied on it here and there and a
couple of fenders fastened up with baling
wire setting out there on the tidy con-
crete street in front of the widows big
house alongside the green grass and the
palm trees it does look considerable like
a feller in overalls at a high toned society
party but i can remember the time
when bobtail would have stepped up in
his red undershirt to shake hands with
the president of the united states if
hed have felt like it

  we aint no more than got the ford
tucked away until he starts fidgeting
about my bath id be dirty after my
ride he says and probably the first thing
id like to do would be to git under the
shower itll refresh me he says

  i aint worrying about a bath and as
for refreshment the ideas me and bobtail
once held in common on that subject
hadnt got nothing to do with water
but it seemed like i had to take it to
please him and i near drowned myself
when i lost my footing on the shiny white
floor and cast myself where i caught the
full force of the faucet

  we got around after all to a drink for
old times sake but it took bobtail a
half hour to make it a man brought up
to tilt his head and dump in his liquor
before it got a chance to raise blisters on
his lips would have been drunk and
sobered up agin by the time hed poured

and measured and squeezed lemons and
oranges into a silver contraption and 
shook it and poured out small sized sam-
ples in long stemmed glasses offering
such a mixture to a traveler thatd come
across a desert to git there seemed noth-
ing short of cruel and i suggests to bob-
tail that we go down to the nearest drug
store and git the boy to throw us together
a big wicked sarsapriller for the next one

  it aint until weve had a half dozen
samples out of that shaker and it begins
to appear the clear stuff bobtail poured
into it out of a bottle must of been some-
thing besides mineral water that things
begin to seem natural and old time like

  bobtail looks at me and i look at him
and he smiles a kind of a sad smile and
waves the hand that aint holding his
drink around him in a hopeless heart-
broke manner

   you see me as i have become he
says me that was once hell on horse-
back and poison to outlaw cayuses golf
pants and a clean shave every morning
oriental rugs on the floor he says still
gesturing and lace curtains at all the
windows a bird in a gilded cage-none
the less sorrerful because it happens to
be a oldish he-bird here i am he says
me that was once a man plumb ruined
nothing but a perfect ladys home com-
panion

   hell i says trying to make believe
what hes said aint the horrid truth
hell i says you old coyote you
aint ruined you may be a little pussy
and a little bald and your clothes and
manners aint no longer very vy-rile but
theres still some fire in your eye youre
still a long ways i says from being
ruined

  he shakes his head and we have an-
other drink

   you dont know he goes on the
sum total of my ruination here i spent
the last fifteen years gitting refined and
living up to the widows ideas of what a
man ought to be shes gentled me down
from what i was when i courted and won
her to what you see me now-a man
that dont cuss dont spit drinks his
the four horsemen



liquor out of a silver can and even wears
pajamas by ways only a woman knows
shes got me down little by little to where
im fussy as a old maid and tame as a
church and got no more vices than a
canary then what does she do  he says

  i aint able to guess the widow as i
remember her being a woman thats
equal to almost anything so we have
another drink

   ill tell you what she does says
bobtail waving the silver shaker which
is now empty who says theres any
reason in women ill tell you what she
does she turns agin me she gits tired
of her own handiwork and goes plumb
nutty about a big manly noble acting
he-man moving pitcher actor

  before bobtail can eloocidate any
further on his sorrow or i can offer him
my sympathy the front door slams and
in comes the widow she looks much the
same as id remembered only she dont
seem to have so rhuch boozom and her
hair is bobbed and shes got on short
kirts and these here stockings that look
like you aint wearing any shes jest
come from some feller with a fancy sound-
ing name that means hes a corn doctor
and she walks tender footed like a horse
thats jest been brought in off the grass
but she gives me a hearty welcome and
says im like a breath of invigorating air
blowed in off the old range and seems
real glad ive come to tone up bobtail
stead of jumping on us for having con-
sorted with liquor she mixes up a fresh
batch sos she can hist one with us it
comes as a surprise to me cause i can
remember her having took the jug away
from us manys the time back there to
badger butte and shut us down in the
cyclone cellar i set it down to stylish-
ness and the more liberal attitude toward
liquor that come in with prohibition

the widow aint been in
the house a half hour before
were setting down to a big
meal of first class vittles i
think its one of these triumphs of the
modern housewife in the modern kitchen

 that youll read about in the ladies
 magazines and make some gallant re-
 marks to the widow about her speed in
 setting out such toney chuck on such
 short notice but it turns out she cant
 take none of the credit except for hustling
 the stuff home while it was still hot from
 a delicatessen store around the corner

   all during the supper the widow shes
 telling us about the pitcher shes been to
 see before she went to the corn doctors
 and about the big masculine hero in it
 who lives right there in hollywood and
 whose name is desmond carruthers
 when she mentions his name and tells
 how strong and manly and vy-rile he is
 bobtail lets out a kind of hollow groan
 but he sets there and takes it like a calf
 being branded

   after supper me and bobtail kind of
 circulate around the premises while the
 widows stacking up the dishes for a girl
 to come in the next morning and do
 this bungalow of the gentrys has got a
 real nice front porch looking out on a
 little patch of green grass and palm trees
 and the houses across the street im
 feeling full and comfortable and desirous
 sof fitting settled down with our feet up
 on the porch rail and gitting started on
 the visiting we got to do to take up the
 slack in fifteen years and having bobtail
 tell me all about the neighbors that are
 watering their lawns with garden hoses and
 setting on their porches and gitting in and
 out of cars thats drawed up along thecurb

   but we aint got time for that now
 theyre going to take me riding and show
 me some sights for a treat i been riding
 for the last couple of weeks and looking
 at nothing but sights on both sides of a
 couple of mountain ranges but there
 aint nothing to do but watch bobtail
 herd his car out of the garage and wipe
 the spots of dust off it with a piece of
 chamois leather its a new seedan and
 is bright and shiny and got little fancy
 curtains to the windows bobtail dont
 talk to it nor cuss it none while hes
 backing out the way youll expect from
 a man thats been brought up with horses

   once we git off the street where the


harry g huse

gentrys live and out on a high toned
street called a boulevard were in a string
of cars like a funeral procession we
move along slow breathing burnt gaso-
line with the widow asking me to pay
attention to the swell homes of the mov-
ing pitcher actors were passing and
pointing out with special pride the elegant
home of this here feller shes already men-
tioned-this desmond carruthers bob-
tail hell try to change the subject now
and then by pointing out civic improve-
ments and acting like hes proud of the
way hollywood is gitting bigger and
better but he cant hold up agin the
widow whos relating everything there is
to know about the movie stars from all
the films they ever played in down to
their personal tastes in rouge dogs under-
wear and lovers

  well i dont take no pleasure in that
evening nor for that matter in the three
four weeks that followed bobtail as i
say was a changed and almost ruined
man i have a hard time figgering it all
out hed let out such a yelp for com-
pany in that letter he wrote me that i
thought all along he was counting on me
bringing him the breath of the great
plains and jarring him out of his tiresome
tracks hed spoke up so free his own
self about whats wrong with him that
time when we had our first drink to-
gether that i got the idea he was all
ready to cut loose and stir up some new
excitement but shucks hes so set in
his ways he dont really want to change
all he wants is company in his misery

  take the matter of clothes he points
out real tactful that the mail order suit i
arrived in aint hardly suitable for all
occasions and leads me down to a place
called a toggery and tries to git me into a
pair of them little boys pants he not
only dont no longer carry and use chew-
ing tobacco but kind of flinches every
time he sees me looking around for a place
to spit which is purty often cuspidors
not having had a place in the gentry
home for a dozen years and the glass
vases in the seedan being intended for
flowers he even tries to git me to lay

abed until seven or eight oclock in the
mornings

  the hardest thing of all is the ever-
lasting sightseeing him and the widow
feel they got to do to keep me entertained
the sights is all right but everywhere we
go it gits on my nerves seeing so many
other people jest like us doing nothing in
such a fussy important manner

when we stay to home it
aint no better bobtails
plumb forgot how to visit
him and the widow have long
ago give up poker playing for this game
called bridge and they dont drink no
liquor only before meals theyre so
took up with the system they got worked
out for killing time that it dont seem
possible to squeeze in nothing else the
widow she keeps busy going to hair
dressers and the corn doctors and reading
moving pitcher magazines bobtail he
tinkers with that seedan and keeps it
shined up and frets about its scratches
and mows and waters his little patch of
lawn and takes baths and changes his
clothes evenings maybe well go to a
christian science lecture or to the t heatres
where well see actors and actrcsses per-
form like people was never knowed to
perform in real life

  it aint until ive stood a month or so
of this and its past new years and i got
used to being dressed up in store clothes
every day all day long and have see so
many sights they dont no longer mean
nothing to me that i rebel agin the life
were leading and feel called upon to talk
to bobtail real serious and earnest

  hell i tell him its a great state of
affairs when men like us that once knowed
how to stir up our own adventures have
come to the point where they got to take
their excitement from looking at new
tall buildings and watching steam shovels
work and reading in the newspapers about
divorce cases and murders and the love
affairs of a lady preacher

  from being a man i tell him hes got
to the point where all he thinks about is
his insides and the things he owns and
the four horsemen



 danged if he aint gitting me to feeling
 the same way too even if it bothers
 him to git dust on his car and miss a bath
 and not water his lawn regular he owes
 it to hisself to keep his hand in here and
 there and be able to take some pride in
 his own deeds instead of them of archi-
 tects and street contractors lurking
 v around amongst the department stores
 and bungalows and delicatessens and
 churches and moving pitcher palaces
 therle must still be some chance in these
 parts for fellers thats proved theirselves
 equal in times past to holding their own
 in lifes rough and tumble my camping
 pardner lon i suggests is likely a man
 thats ready for most anything after hav-
 ing spent several weeks with his daughter
 why dont we look him up which i been
 intending to do all along and see if there
 aint some man size entertainment the
 three of us can stir up together

   bobtail seems enthusiastic about it
 for a few minutes and something like his
 old fire comes back danged if i aint
 right he says and danged if he aint
 ready for anything he sneaks a bottle
 of that pale colored liquor out of the side-
 board and we git in the car and start for
 the address lon gave me its over in
 another part of town but the streets look
 jest like all the others-all neat and clean
 and nice tidy houses

   we find lon out on the front porch
 with his feet set rebellious on the railing
 trying to kill the bugs on a fancy rose-
 bush by shooting tobacco juice at them
 theres a desperate look in his eye and
 from the stains on the porch rail he must
 have spent most of the time since i last
 saw him at the same occupation

   his eyes light up when i tell him
 were setting out for an old time taste of
 excitement and adventure with the sky
 the limit but the spark dies out right
 away we wont find it he says hes
 tried already he says and the only real
 excitement hes had all the time hes
 been here was to fall down with a tray of
 dishes in a cafeteria he didnt even git
 no kick he says out of the idaho state
 picnic there wasnt no broncho busting

and there wasnt no faro layout nor no
liquor all the people done was eat like
horses and then set around the rest of the
afternoon and talk about how hard they
used to work before they retired and come
here and how they earned the right to
this pleasant easy life and then started
complaining about the things that ailed
them

  still and all lons willing to go in the
house and git his hat and come along
with us we sneak around into his
daughters garage and all have a pull out
of bobtails bottle taken in its natural
state like that without no cracked ice or
fruit juices its got some body to it and
we all feel better after tilting two three
good swallers into our systems the
horizon seems to be gitting wider and the
distances mysterious the way they used
to back in montana when bobtail and
me was young fellers in off the range with
three months pay in our pockets

im feeling real good
when we come out of that
garage and start for the street
but that shiny seedan with
them fancy curtains at the windows and a
bunch of cloth flowers in the vase inside
and a green vizor over the windshield like
barbers wear-only bigger to keep the
sun out of your eyes-and them tidy
houses and lawns and smooth concrete
streets dont let it last long

  well we started cruising around look-
ing for something exciting to do and the
only thing that happens all morning is
that we git cussed out by a woman that
scraped our fender and that we took to
be a lady until she opened her mouth
noon finds us waiting on ourselves in a
cafeteria with the liquor gone and all
three of us sober

  after dinner we start out agin hope-
ful we go by a vacant lot where theres
been a big tabernacle built and some
revivalist is holding services theres
shouting and singing coming out of the
building it sounds livelier than any-
thing weve saw so far so we git down
and go in


harry g huse 

  the revivalist is preaching about sin
and to hear him tell it the town is full of
it were living he claims in a dissolute
age with wine women and song rampant
and the devil laying in wait jest around
the corner it cheers us up considerable
to hear him and we put a dollar in the
collection plate when its passed and
start out agin more hopeful

  lon and me are for having bobtail
hunt up the bootlegger where he gits that
liquor of his but bobtail dont know his
address because the feller just comes to
the house regular like the milkman and
takes orders and then comes back and
delivers

  the preachers reference to the parts
of town where the pleasures of the flesh
hes referred to are the most rampant
have been kind of vague and general and
we dont have no luck locating them
we remember hes talked considerable
about the actors and actresses being dis-
solute and has hinted at high jinks around
the movie lots so after a while we circu-
late out in that direction there aint
nothing exciting that we can see maybe
something is going on inside the fences
but we dont git no further than a little
house by a gate with a sour faced feller in
it keeping folks from going inside unless
they got some business

  were all set to come away when lon
happens to read something thats wrote in
chalk on a big blackboard they got there
by the gate its a list of what they call
extras that theyre needing for some of
their pitchers and down among them
theres a note that theyre going to want
a lot of fellers that are able to ride horse-
back they specially want about a
dozen middle aged or oldish fellers that
are willing to grow whiskers

  well all three of us can ride horse-
back that is we once could ride a horse
or a steer or any critter that was haired
over were middle aged to oldish all
right and can raise whiskers if we try
fact lons already got the beginning of
his it being near the end of the week and
him one of these fellers that objects to
shaving any other time except sunday

before we know it weve got by that
feller in the little house and are marching
inside the gate to a second feller that
looks us over and sizes us up like this was
a county fair and we was fat beef stock
seems like hes satisfied with us though
his face dont show it and were engaged
to come back in three weeks for our first
taste of being movie actors

  were to leave town the feller says
the pitchers to be took out in the coun-
try where theres plenty of natural
scenery were to bring our nightshirts
if any and a change of socks and sleep in
tents while practising and gitting the
pitcher shot

  on the way home bobtail starts
worrying about being able to git away for
that long he aint stayed out so much
as a night for so long hes all out of the
habit the widow he says is scared to
stay alone every day you read about
the burglaries in the papers i can re-
member the time when the widow run a
drunk halfbreed that was waving a knife
right off her place with no other weapon
but a butter paddle lon and me are
lucky bobtail says me not having any
women folks to git weak and timid on
me and lons daughter having a husband
to look after her

  bobtail shakes his head real doleful
all the way home and its plain to be seen
hes kind of expecting and hoping the
widowll set her foot down hard on the
idea of his going out in the hills and riding
a horse around amongst the sagebrush

  but hes misjudged the widow shes
been reading in the movie magazines
about this pitcher thats going to be took
and already knows something about it
it aint jest a western cowboy pitcher
like we thought on account of their want-
ing horsemen its to be a big a-rab
pitcher of the desert and strong men with
oriental ideas about their women and
fighting and love making and races across
the hot desert sands and its to be called
the passion flower the star in it is
to be this desmond carruthers that the
widows so crazy about and the heroine
is vivienne lamonte
the four horsemen



  the widows all excited and proud
about our having been took for the
pitcher and gitting a chance to associate
with a big star bobtails lost what little
enthusiasm he had when he hears about
this carruthers and hes more than ever
for backing out on the job but the
widow wont listen to it shes already
planning on coming out to visit us while
the pitcher is being took

  we jest sit around the next three
weeks killing time and reading up in the
moving pitcher magazines about our
fellow actors lonll come over most
every day to git away from his daughter
who aint sympathetic about his project
like the widow and objects steady to his
starting out to grow a face crop of hair
at his time of life

we already know from
the widow that this desmond
carruthers is a big handsome
manly man thats jest full of
cool heroism and vy-rility and personal
charm its claimed that in this new
pitcher hell rise to heights of nobility
even greater than any hes ever reached
before a lot of the stuff we read is about
the heroine from her pitchers shes a
humdinger and the write-ups all claim
shes jest a sweet old fashioned girl thats
been left simple and unspoiled by the
popularity that has made her one of the
foremost stars shes got a innocent
happy outlook on life and her one big
ambition is to become even bigger and
better for her public and to make a com-
fortable home for her dear old mother
and a pure bred roosian wolfhound
thats always with her in her photographs

  here and there we find some reference
to her first and second husbands neither
one of who is now current it seems like
quite a few helpmates for a simple old
fashioned girl thats only going on twenty-
four but bobtail argues that having a
disposition like it says and being loving
and trusting they probably took advan-
tage of her and she got rid of them and
went back to being simple and old fash-
ioned as soon as she was able the widow

dont put much faith in what the maga-
zines say about the girl but she believes
every word about desmond carruthers

  well the morning comes around when
were to report at the studio the widow
takes us all down and leaves us at the
gate with much regret inside theyre
gathering people up and loading them in
busses theyre a funny looking crowd
of folks-about fifty other assorted fellers
and a bunch of girls and women the big
actors aint to be seen they dont herd
with the common run of folks but will
come out later when the pitchers ready
to be took

  it aint until were settled in the
busses that i git a chance to size up the
others lon and bobtail are sharing a
seat together and alongside mes a big
young feller that must scale six foot two
when hes standing up and is wearing
elegant clothes and has got blue eyes set
wide apart and one of these big sober
honest faces

  him and me set right to work gitting
acquainted his names horace ebbets
and he was born in the pendleton coun-
try where his father was a big old time
cattleman the old man give up cattle
when horace was a boy and moved up
into the palouse country where he got to
be a big wheat rancher horace jest
stayed around home and helped his father
who was old fashioned and didnt believe
in too much education

  the old man kept horace in close and
worked him hard and horace aint never
been around much or been able to do
nothing but help run the big ranch here
a year back the old man died and horace
that aint never had no spending money
but what little the old man dealt out to
him finds himself the owner of land worth
two three hunderd thousand dollars with
a good steady income that makes him feel
like a millionaire he come down to cali-
fornia for the winter and while he was
loafing around killing time he come on
this chance to see something of the inside
of moving pitchers and took it

  thats about all i git out of him at the
first setting i make horace acquainted


harry g huse

with lon and bobtail and the four of us
team up together horace fits in fine
being one of these slow thinking honest
good hearted fellers thats short on humor
but steady as a team of workhorses

  the place where they dump us out
after a long ride is a big sandy desert
the sands all bare and blowed into hills
like big snow drifts theres a bunch of
palm trees stuck up in one place to look
like an oasis and off in another place a
big structure that looks like the front
side of a fort a feller in army pants and
riding boots starts yelling at us through
a megaphone the minute we set foot on
the ground we could have heard him if
hed whispered but hes so used to talking
into the thing out of the corner of his
mouth i guess hed have been dumb
without it

  hes telling us whats expected of us
part of us including me and lon and
horace and bobtail are supposed to be
a-rabs the others is french soldiers
the horses are picketed to a long cable
stretched between posts theres also
some donkeys and a half dozen camels
bobtail whos been worrying about what
kind of beds were going to have to sleep
on cheers up right away when he sees the
horses seems like hes a new man when
he gits among them cayuses and works
down along the line looking over their
points and coming across some old well
knowed brands the four of us pick us
out the best of the lot and start looking
around for saddles but at this point
the feller with the megaphone takes a
hand

  he looks us over sharper even than
the feller that hired us and right away he
picks lon out and sizes him up alongside
one of the camels he seems real happy
to see how lon and the brute kind of go
together and picks him out on the spot
to ride that ship of the desert lon puts
up a big holler he aint never rode one
of the critters he says and they smell
bad and are apt to bring back his hay
fever and anyway hes got a big general
objection to them having once been a
bartender but the feller with the mega-

phone gits around him by making him
think anybody can ride a horse but it
takes a extra good man to ride a camel

all this time bobtails
been fidgeting around a big
high withered roan with a wall
eye and a lot of spirit i can
see the little fellers shucked off fifteen
years and is jest itching to fork that
cayuse and rake him a little and see what
hes got in him but the feller with the
megaphones got other ideas he sizes up
bobtail most as close as he done lon
and danged if he dont pick him out to
be a old patriarch a-riding one of the
donkeys horace he gits the roan and i
draw a hammer headed sorrel

  maybe you seen this picture-the
passion flower-and know the story
its high toned and full of action and ele-
gant sentiments it starts with a tribe of
a-rabs ruled by a big mysterious chief
thats come from god knows where and
climbed up to be boss by force of char-
acter during its spare time this tribe
is fighting the french

 one day the chief kidnaps a high class
white girl thats been visiting friends in
one of the french forts and got restless
and wandered out in the desert to pick
passion flowers that shed heard growed
in a certain oasis she finds the flowers
all right but before she can pick them
the big chief comes along and jerks her
up on the horse behind him and carries
her off to another oasis where the tribe
is camped

  hes going to treat her jest like any
other good looking woman he found out
loose in the desert hunting passion flowers
down underneath its kind of hinted she
hopes he will but when he gits her back
to his tent among the oriental rugs and
soft pillows this girlish innocence and
purity shes noted for makes him hold up
it stirs up a lot of forgotten things in him
that makes him think bitterly of his
present life and look back to the time
when he was worthy to face so much
maidenly purity

  even though he is passing for an
the four horsemen



a-rab chief hes really a white man down
underneath his a-rab clothes and his sun-
burn-a french soldier of high birth that
deserted from the army and turned agin
his country personally it seems to me
that a purty woman thats been hunting
passion flowers is most as safe in the
hands of an a-rab as she is in the hands
of a frenchman or any other kind of ex-
soldier but it aint that way in the film

  theres what starts out to be a big
love scene but ends up by his throwing
the girl back down on the couch in a
panting heap and rushing out of the tent
to gallop all night over the desert biting
his nails and clenching his fists and other-
wise going through the agonies of a man
thats trying to git back his lost soul

  this experience with the girl raises
the devil with the chief its been pre-
viously planned how the tribe is going to
sweep down on the fort next morning and
wipe the french off the map with a sur-
prise attack but overnight the chief
finds out he is a frenchman and a white
man and a gentleman after all theres
a scene back at his tent jest before dawn
with all the hot lust hes felt the night
before turned into a great self-sacrificing
love he tells the girl hes white as she is
and feels called upon to expose his chest
and thump it for her to see

  this sets her panting agin but she
holds herself in something noble is
growing up in her too the french garri-
son must be saved the only thing to
do is for her to take his swiftest a-rab
stallion and ride back to the fort with
news of the attack while he delays the
tribesmen as much as he can theres
strong feelings here shes riding out of
his life jest when their great love has
dawned going back to her kind while he
must remain the self-sacrificing renegade

  it looks tough for the two of them
right here and the breaks keep going
agin them right up almost to the end of
the pitcher the heroines horse falls
and busts a leg she keeps going on foot
the attacking party with the big chief
at the head comes up in sight of her when
shes most to the fort the chief thinks

all is lost and spurs ahead he grabs up
the girl and heads for the fort shooting
back at the rest of the a-rabs thats in
pursuit their horse is shot and they
stand off the others from behind it until
the french can come out from the fort
and take a hand and run the a-rabs off
theres a happy ending with the hero
gitting the girl and a pardon from the
french for being so noble

  thats the story part of its been
already took in the studio back in holly-
wood and the rest is what we start re-
hearsing first off were a caravan going
peaceful over the desert then were
lounging around the oasis and after that
we stage a big fight with shooting and wild
riding we go over and over it and git
all messed up and what with the hot
sun and sand and our not having rode
much lately horace and mere ready to
call it a day when it gits six oclock and
the feller with the megaphone is through
yelling at us

after supper me and hor-
ace go for a little walk to take
the stiffness out of our legs
its gitting dark and the deserts
cool and quiet and after awhile horace
opens up like a boy thats in trouble and
tells me some more about himself

  seems like he aint never had much
to do with girls nor none of the other
pleasures of life hes worked hard like
he was a hired hand and aint had no
chance to circulate around and git ac-
quainted with people about his only
recreation was slipping into the moving
pitchers now and agin when he was in
town on business for his old man

  during one of these debauches hes
seen this heroine this vivienne lamonte
in a film called all for love and has
right away fell in love with her hes
gone plumb nutty and dreamed about her
nights and read everything he could find
out about her

  naturally his feelings toward the lady
are kind of general and hazy like a man
feels towards the queens hell read about
in history but when the old man dies


harry g huse

horace suddenly realizes hes free and
got property and a steady income and all
the bars that held him in are down hes
like a boy let out of school

  there aint nothing to hold him back
now from following up his great love and
coming down to hollywood and gitting
himself swell clothes and moving in high
toned circles and actually meeting the
lady of his dreams

  so after the fall works finished hes
left things in charge of a foreman and
drawed himself plenty of money and
come to hollywood and put up at one of
the swell hotels its a couple of weeks
before hes outfitted and barbered and
cultured up enough to be willing to make
a start at meeting the object of his adora-
tion first off he writes her letters that
he makes up with the help of a book hes
bought on the subject but they dont
git no answer he supposes shes both-
ered to death with fellers writing her
letters and aint got no way to tell which
ones is sincere and which is rascals

  he takes to hanging around her house
hoping that something will happen that
he can take advantage of and accidentally
meet her but he only gits glimpses of
her passing in or out of her car

  he has other ideas like gitting a job
as her chauffeur and suddenly revealing
himself as her admirer after she has
learned to trust him he even considers
the plan of gitting a job cutting the grass
on her lawn or being her butler but this
dont come to nothing finally he gits to
hanging around the studio and he sees
this notice of horsemen wanted for the
big pitcher shes going to star in thats
his big chance to meet her out of doors in
the environment hes used to and so
here he is

  well we spend the next day jest doing
some more practising vivienne lamonte
nor desmond carruthers nor none of the
real actors are in sight we go over the
same riding and fighting and shooting
with the feller yelling at us through the
megaphone and all us riders that was once
horsemen but have got kind of out of
condition gitting stiffer and crosser and

more saddle-galled bobtail aint taking
no physical punishment being a patriarch
and not supposed to move around much
but hes suffering plenty in the spirit
having to sit around on that long eared
steed of his and watch the rest of us ride
and thinking how hes going to look in
the eyes of the widow straddling that
donkey while her big hero desmond
carruthers cavorts around on the pure
bred arabian horse they got for him

  im having frequent recourse to my
bottle of spavin cure and even horace
whos been in better condition is a little
stiff in the joints from staying on that
big roan lon hes worse off than any
that camel of his has got a gait that
aint like no other living critter and its
hard to git used to lon dont have no
trouble staying on the feller that owns
and looks after the camels has told him
how to avoid the shocks by keeping his
body loose and letting it sway with the
motion of the critter lon leaves them
lanky two three yards of his so loose
his head looks like a corn tassel in a high
wind it eases up the strain on his back-
bone but it makes him seasick and hes
gitting gaunted up from not being able to
hold no food on his stomach

  its while we been doing all the prac-
tising that we first notice one of the girls
thats among the extras they got about
a dozen women supposed to be setting
around the oasis most of them is purty
silly acting and stage struck theyre
always gitting theirselves into attitudes
and doing things to attract the attention
of the feller with the megaphone but
this girl shes sensible and good looking
and quiet shes purtier in her own right
than the other ones thats got theirselves
all tricked up some with wavy tresses
that hang down on their shoulders and
some with their hair made into little spit
curls on their foreheads and some with
sweet winning expressions and others with
haughty dignity

  among all these posing females this
girl stands out like a sore thumb and the
second evening me and bobtail and lon
we git acquainted with her were setting
the four horsemen



in front of our tent when she passes by
and hears us talking about lons boy-
hood home-the snake river country
she stops and smiles at us like we was old
friends and asks if she can sit down and
visit with us

seems like shes from up in
that part of the country herself
and shes lonesome to hear
about it her fathers been a
storekeeper in one of the small idaho
towns his health failed after her mother
died and shes brought him down to cali-
fornia i gather they aint any too well
off and between times of taking care of
her old man she looks up anything she
can to earn a little extra money

  she aint never had nothing to do with
the moving pitchers before and aint got
no silly notions about them shes jest
come out here to earn a few extra dollars
shes used to ranch life and has been
around outdoor men a lot and knows how
to git along with them we have a real
pleasant visit im wishing horace might
be with us too itd do him good to see
and talk to a real girl but hes in the
eating tent sweating over a letter hes
hoping to be able to slip to vivienne
lamonte when she shows up the next
day and he dont git back in time to be
interduced to this girl whose name is
plain smith alice smith both of them
spelled with an i the way they was
intended shes the kind of a girl thatd
have kept me from being a bachelor if
id have met her at horaces age but
hes so full of this vivienne lamonte that
even if he had met alice she might jest
as well have been bowlegged like bobtail
or lean and hungry and bent in the middle
like good old lon or haired over with
brindle whiskers like yours truly

  well the actors come the next morn-
ing horace hes found out when theyre
going to git here and hes right in the
middle of the crowd of stage struck girls
thats giggling and watching desmond
carruthers git down out of his car
viviennes in the seat beside him laying
back languid agin the cushions paying

no attention to common folks she acts
more like she was cleopatra than the
simple sweet little girl thats making her
life work the care of her dear old mother
and the roosian wolfhound but horace
is so excited jest seeing her close that way
that i guess he dont pay no notice

  i dont git more than a glimpse of her
because i been busy gitting into my
a-rab costume but i hear her a plenty
five ten minutes later her and des-
mond carruthers have gone into the tent
of the feller with the megaphone and the
choicest line of cuss words i ever listen
to in my life is coming out through the
canvas viviennes damning the di-
rectors eyes and everything else she can
think of because hes drug her out here
today when she had an appointment with
her hairdresser from the conversation
it seems like her and carruthers are en-
gaged and when he puts in an oar she
cuts loose and damns him too

  i run to git lon and bobtail not
being willing for them to miss a elegant
treat the like of which i aint never heard
even in the palmiest days of the roundup
im going to git horace too and git some
of them fool worshiping ideas of his out
of his head but hes killed so much
time standing there waiting for vivienne
and watching her git down out of the car
that he aint dressed yet and hes all in a
sweat gitting into his baggy a-rab pants
and smearing on his sunburned com-
plexion

  before were ready to start with the
pitcher theres a complication comes up
vivienne it seems wont go near a horse
let alone ride one theyve brought out
a girl that looks some like her to do the
riding but this girls been took sick on
the way out and now she aint able to
hold up her head

  the director feller hes had his eye
on this friend of ours this alice smith i
mentioned she can ride like she was
born in a saddle and though she dont
look none like vivienne in the face shes
got the same figger and the same color
hair the director fixes it up with her
to do viviennes riding viviennes agin


harry g huse

it she claims no common extra girl that
dont know nothing about how her tem-
perament reacts to emotions can double
for her even in the riding and kidnaping
parts where there aint no need to show
her face theres the beginning of an-
other cussing match and vivienned had
her way and gone back to town if car-
ruthers whos been eying alice hadnt
sided with the director and helped to
smooth her down carruthers hes been
taking riding lessons in a park back in
hollywood and dont need no double the
kind of clothes he wears in the pitcher
being long and flowing and hiding the
half foot of blue sky and white desert
youd ordinarily see between him and the
saddle every time the horse sets down a
couple of feet

   well after a lot of false starts we git
under way horace hes missed all the
fussing when he conies out of the dress-
ing tent everythings been fixed up and
he dont know nothing about the arrange-
ment of somebody else doing viviennes
riding we go at the thing hindside fore-
most and first we stage the stand-off in
front of the fort everything goes along
purty well except for lon gitting seasick
on his camel right in front of the camera
and that part having to be took over
again horace and me most rides our-
selves to death and when we git through
that part horaces lost his turban and
got his head all full of sand and i got a
hole in my pants where a french soldiers
shot me with a blank bobtail hes jest
been patriarching around on his donkey
amongst the women and girls and aint
had no hand in the fight

we been expecting the
widow to show up almost any
time like she threatened but
we worry along through two
three other parts and she aint nowhere
to be seen

  we git around finally to the scene
where the chief first captures the heroine
lon and me were riding guard at the far
side of the oasis horace hes one of the
a-rabs lounging in front of the tent

bobtail hes setting his donkey in among
the girls and women the big hero
carruthers and alice smith are standing
alone a little ways off alongside his horse
waiting for the camera to come and take
the pitcher of the abduction poor old
horace is all eyes for alice smith who he
thinks at that distance is vivienne la-
monte i can see him fumbling with the
letter hes got wrote to give her

  theres a hitch somewheres while
were waiting i see the noble feller car-
ruthers commencing to git fresh with
alice hes so used to women falling for
him i guess he thinks alice has fell too
hes kind of pawing at her in a sneaking
way shes disgusted and pulling away
from him he keeps it up and lon and
me were gitting restless when we see
alice slap him he goes plumb mad at
that and grabs her lon lets out a
whoop and larrups his camel i throw
the spurs into my cayuse but while
were gitting under way we hear a roar
like a bull and see horace charging
right behind him lickety split with the
sand flying comes bobtail on his little
donkey hes been a-smoldering and
a-smoldering there all day and has finally
took fire

  carruthers hears all the ruckus coming
and lets go alice he swings round with
the scared nasty look of the natural bom
coward on his face hes got a revolver
but there aint nothing but blanks in it
but hes wearing a long curved scabbard
at his belt that holds a real sword he
takes one look at all us a-rabs thundering
down on him and pulls out the sword and
swings it awkward up- into the air like a
boy thats playing soldier with a stick
horace dont even appear to see it he
jest charges right under it and before
carruthers can do moren take a nick
out of his ear horace lays the big chief
out flattern if hed been kicked by a mule

  there wouldnt have been nothing for
lon and bobtail and me to do cept lift
up the fallen hero if it hadnt been for
vivienne lamonte shes seen the fracas
from back in the directors tent and here
she comes like a spitting wildcat to take a
the four horsemen



hand horace is standing there batting
his eyes at alice and trying to figger out
how she comes to look so different when
the sweet simple vivienne who hes
thought he was rescuing sails into him
from behind she fetches him a claw
down the side of the face that leaves four
red tracks in the meantime blistering
him with the worst language i ever heard
theres gitting to be a lot of confusion as
folks have started running up over my
shoulder i see the man with the mega-
phone coming and behind him a shiny
seedan with its front wheels wobbling in
the sand

  carruthers has got to his feet by now
with so many folks around him i guess he
feels like he ought to be brave viviennes
keeping horace good and busy so car-
ruthers picks on the smallest feller he can
find which is bobtail agin he makes a
big mistake bobtail lets out a old joyous
whoop i aint heard in fifteen years and
jest swarms all over the big hero hes
got the noble feller down and is kind of
marching back and forth on him when
vivienne quits horace sudden and takes a
hand she makes a pass with them claws
of hers and bobtails bald head suffers
shes starting a second pass when a
capable figger steps out of the crowd
its the widow thats got there too late
for the pitcher but in time to see her
husband clean up on her moving pitcher
idol and now being raked by vivienne
lamonte before we know whats up
the widows grabbed the heroine and is
setting down strong and determined in
the sand with vivienne bent handy and
receptive across her lap

  well that simple sweet old fashioned
spanking the widow delivers busts up the
fracas desmond and vivienne are
bruised and temperamental wrecks the
director who dont seem as much put out
as you might expect ships them off home
in their automobile being an ingenious

feller he makes up horace as carruthers
and takes the big kidnaping scene with
him snatching up alice and galloping off
on his horse with her behind him they
look real elegant together

  lon and me we ride back lonesome in
the bus that night the widow and bob-
tail they take horace and alice smith
they make out theres plenty of room for
us too but what with horace all excited
to find out alice squares up jest about
perfect with the pitcher of vivienne
lamonte hes had in his mind and the
widow commencing to look agin at bob-
tail with the admiration she used to feel
when he was performing back on the
range it aint the proper atmosphere for
a couple of old coyotes thats put the
thoughts of domestic joys behind them
and are jest kind of killing time until
they can git back to open country where
they belong

  the old homesteader paused to sigh
profoundly

  lon and me he resumed had a nice
time camping together on our way home
soon as it come spring he wasnt overly
choice as a bedfellow as i already ex-
plained but he liked to visit we had
horace and alices wedding to talk over
and bobtails smashing up the shiny
seedan agin a telephone post and fight-
ing a policeman and busting up a chris-
tian science meeting and gitting throwed
out of the first performance of the pas-
sion flower for horse laughing at all the
noble parts and finally gitting so free
spirited lon and me didnt no longer dast
go out with him and the widow deciding
theyd better move up on a wheat
ranch alongside horace and alice in the
palouse

  he sighed again and tilting forward in
his chair fumbled for fine-cut

  largely as i said in the beginning
he said a wasted winter or at any
rate almost wasted
  cyl story of morocco by george e holt

al lateef the clever one

the mourners came the son for whom he
had let his heart be cut in twain but
though the one heart was painless now
the other throbbed with agony the fatal
knife now twisted its bitter edge in the
sons own bosom

  la illaha ilia allah chanted al
lateef there is no god but allah and
in the name of this only god would he
punish his fathers murderers two must
pay the price of that knife thrust in the
dark-in the darkness where the elder
man had waited to warn his son against
the very fate that had come upon him-
self the blow struck they had gone
happily away certain of the identity of
their victim for had not they themselves
lured him there sooner or later both
must pay



jl l lateef the clever one chant-
  ing la illaha ilia allah
j  walked with heavy feet and
- bowed head behind the board
upon which lay his father his heart
gashed open

  la illaha ilia allah chanted the
mourners ahead of the bier la illaha
ilia allah chanted those behind like a
prolonged echo

  there is no god but allah they pro-
claimed to the dead and to the living
the living answered likewise the dead
was silent with secret wisdom

  upon the rough wooden bier carried on
the robed shoulders of four men the
father of sid hassan sanhajji the clever
one rode to burial as an ancient baron
upon his shield behind him last among
al lateef the clever one



  la illaha there was no god but
allah-but that which allah permitted
was sometimes bitter on the souls lips
to find him lying there-price of his sons
safety aiwa they should pay for every
drop of that brave blood which had
flowed gladly that a son might live

  chanting he marched on detection
a lateef was unafraid no one would
look for his face beneath the grime of the
charcoal seller shuffling along at the rear
of the mourners-as though a hired chan-
ter he had had time to disguise himself
very well indeed rheumy eyelids in a
carbon smudged face ashy hair instead
of the glossy black a nose distorted by a
wad thrust up one nostril but there was
yet a better reason to be unafraid all
tangier knew that a lateef the clever
one had been outwitted at last had met
summary death-and that this was his
funeral and so all tangier watched it go
by a few with satisfaction but most with
regret for sidi hassan sanhajji the
clever one

  no more than three people knew that
he who rode the wood was indeed san-
hajji but sanhajji the father not the son
and those two who had done the vicious
deed rejoiced in their ignorance that
vengeance in a ragged brown robe
walked behind the bier avowing that
there was no god but allah

  not only rejoiced-watched that very
vengeance stride past before the noses of
their horses as they sat saddle in the
great sok their handiwork and it was
orange water in their nostrils

  two striking figures these assassins
elegantly portly figures swathed in the
dignity of cream tinted ksas their horses
decked with embroidered saddles and
head gear his excellency the khalifa
of tetwan kaid wazzani aide to the
vizier of war two notables from whom
the crowded democracy of the market-
place kept respectful distance a lateef
observed them briefly from beneath the
hood of his wretched djellaba truly those
who supposed they strode in broad paths
of safety actually walked that narrow
bridge which spans the flames of hell to-

morrow    the next day    father
sanhajjis heart would be healed with the
balm of vengeance la illaha ilia la   

  the city gate was passed the burying
ground reached the child returned to its
mother earth and then a lateef
turned from the grave and strode swiftly
away towards those events which in the
name of allah the just he had vowed
should come to pass

weakness against strength
cunning against power mind
against force for a lateef
was a hunted man a price upon
his dark head not for a crime that he
had done but as he now perceived for a
crime he had not done when he had
risen to power he should have turned
upon his foes and slain them thus se-
curing safety for himself but he had
aided them let them live and plot and at
last overthrow him yes his crime was
one of omission a dead enemy makes
three friends and having overthrown
him deprived him of office of home of a
safe stone whereon to lay his head they
now hunted him had hunted him as one
hunts the wild boar in the green mesas
back of tetwan the bitter thought
came to him that had he not committed
the crime of omission the hands that had
struck down his father might have been
impotent for harm too late for that
but not too late to mete out punishment

  nor was vengeance the only motive
which now impelled a lateef true in
comparison it was infinitely weaker
yet it added if that were possible to the
deadly rage which made his heart throb
as though he had been running he must
deal out that justice upon which revenge
is based but he must also regain his own
-property which had been stolen from
him by his fathers murderer and that
property was a woman

  a lateefs secondary motive must in
no wise be confused with that milk-and-
water abstraction of the occident-love
a woman had been stolen from him but
he had no thought as the west would
have for her personal safety her own


george e holt

emotions either of fear or grief or pain
she was only a woman nevertheless
she was a lateefs property and al-
though he would not have gone across the
street because of an impulse of affection for
any female he would walk through flames
to regain that which had been stolen from
him besides he had never seen her

  a lateef did not fail to perceive that
the death of his father had been one of the
results of a plot of which another result
had been intended

  marnia she was called daughter of old
sid abdeslam of tangier to whom a
lateef had paid the purchase money just
before he had been forced to fly for his
life the bargain had been closed prop-
erty purchased the fact that his flight
had prevented the marriage ceremony
whereby she would have been brought to
the door of his house in a silken covered
box on a donkey did not invalidate the
purchase in the least nevertheless sid
abdeslam had resold la mamia to the
basha for his hareem and thereafter
supposedly had killed her rightful owner

  now a lateef knew many things
about this entire matter included in his
knowledge was the fact that la marnia
had not yet journeyed donkeyback into
the bashas hareem that the night of the
present day she was to make the journey
he saw the procession even as he shuffled
along behind the corpse of his father
there would be first a score of musicians
lantern bearers and friends to lead the
march the musicians would produce a
ceaseless shrieking of monotonous sounds
upon the ghaitahs which were much like
the american clarinet upon which he
sometimes played-only much louder and
of more limited range there would be
three or four drummers tum-tumming
with their fingers upon the skin stretched
across the openings of earthen jugs per-
haps two or three gimbris of gourd or
turtle shell like diminutive banjos with
three strings the lantern bearers would
swing backward and forward in unison
with the music the tin lanterns with
colored glass panels in which burned
candles

  the making of lanterns reflected a
lateef accounted for the quantity of
standard oil used in the country the five
gallon cans were used by the tinsmiths
he wondered what became of the oil
and the guests would chant highly sug-
gestive or positively indecent interpre-
tations of the thousand nights and a
night

  after them would ride the bride in a
box on the back of a donkey a box the
size of a packing case with a peaked top
and covered with silken hangings not
only for decorative effect but to conceal
the bride-to-be within it would roll as
a ship in a heavy sea upon the little
donkeys back would be kept from slip-
ping by a man walking on either side
and after the bride would follow more
musicians more lantern bearers more
friends singing or shouting or just walk-
ing along for the sake of being there the
procession would pass through the narrow
streets perhaps no more than five or six
feet wide in places like a whirlpool of
light and noise the candles in the lan-
terns would be extinguished by sudden
movement confusion whenever any other
pedestrians or riders were encountered
all alike processions whether the march-
ers chanted before and behind the wood
or before and behind the bridal box   
the procession of life and death   

  funeral procession to the chant of la
illaha wedding procession to the notes
of the blithe ghaitah

  there had been the first yes there
should still be the second so resolved a
lateef grimly and sought discreet but
astonished friends in the marketplace
and later in more secluded precincts

al lateefs vision of a
wedding procession came
doubly true for even as la
marnia in the box upon the
donkeys back set forth with true femi-
nine placidity and submission to the will
of allah for the house of her lord the
basha the bats flying over the house-
tops could have seen another wedding
party noisily advancing along a street
al lateef the clever one



which ran parallel to that followed by the
other almost parallel that is for the
two canon-like thoroughfares came to-
gether in a certain point blended into
one dark and dismal precisely at the
same moment the two processions en-
countered each other crashed into each
other became inextricably confused the
two donkeys bearing the wedding boxes
snorted and jumped as though struck
by the devils horns the boxes upon their
backs rolled dangerously and new hands
supported them lights were dropped or
knocked out of fingers and darkness en-
gulfed the melee

  lights came on again the tumult died
down order came out of chaos the pro-
cession destined for the bashas house
proceeded on its way the other turned
off very shortly into a side street two
men injured in the conflict were left be-
hind these two had held upright one of
the bridal boxes

  the basha stood in the doorway of his
house-or more precisely at the outer
door of a certain room in his house where
he had decided to receive the latest ad-
dition to his hareem he heard the music
approach and rubbed his fat hands
greasily the procession entered the
grounds with a blast of sound which was
an outrage to the ear swept up to the
open door two men lifted the wooden
box from the donkeys back set it down
upon the ground at the bashas feet then
the entire party passed on bringing their
backs to bear upon the bashas private
business sought entrance to that portion
of the house where food and drink were
offered to one and all

  enter la marnia grunted the
basha stepping back a little

  he was an impressive figure in his
house clothing of crimson velvet heavily
embroidered with silken designs-baggy
velvet breeches stockings of whitest
wool new golden slippers and three-
quarter length coat which was almost a
kimono encircled by a glowing silken
belt of many colors

  the curtains of the box bulged spread
and a white figure lunged forth-passed

through the doorway the basha re-
treated another step he swung the door
closed with a hasty hand and reached
for the woolen haik which was wrapped
about the figure which stood before him
covering all except the eyes

  but as he made the motion the haik
was thrown aside the man whom he had
killed stood revealed the menace of
eternity in his cold eyes

  the fat hand which the basha extended
as though to disprove the existence of the
ghasty vision trembled with sudden
palsy it drew back afraid to stifle the
groan upon his parted lip-a groan which
bore the name of al lateef like the
scraping of slipper sole upon gravel

  but as swiftly as it had enwrapped him
in its paralyzing ice the mantle of fear
fell at his feet his sight flashed from
the face of al lateef to the closed door
back to the knife handle in the belt of al
lateef unreal impossible al lateef
was dead al lateef had ridden the wood
to the chant of la illaha ilia allah this
very day

  those of the faith who die in protecting
the faith-against either false prophets
or emissaries of shaitan the evil one-
gain paradise and the smiles of the one
prophet

  allah rasped the basha i have
killed al lateef once now i must kill his
apparition back his hand fled to the
knife at his silken belt back to el
hotama whence   

  but ere the knife was clear of its sheath
al lateefs hand moved with all the speed
which anger can give to human muscles-
a speed far greater than fear can generate
his hand seemed for a moment to press
against the bashas crimson velveted
breast and then to press him downward
-slowly-slowly to the tiled floor

  al lateef left the knife in its new
sheath threw the haik about himself
and stepped into the wedding box which
was immediately lifted to the donkeys
back by two men and the party then set
off singing at a swift pace

  and this swift pace took them very
shortly to the bab-el-fahs the gate in


arthur woodward

the city wall which gives on the road to
fez all gates are closed at sundown
and so was the bab-el-fahs now guards
were on duty to see that it remained
closed to those whose business in coming
or going could not be satisfactorily ex-
plained even as a lateef in the bridal
box rode up to the gate another wed-
ding party descended upon it from an-
other direction

no body of united states troops
ever had so strange a name as did
the mormon battalion which was
recruited from the immigrant camps of
the latter day saints for service in
california during the mexican war
-

  in those days the mormons were hav-
ing a turbulent time among their neigh-
bors in missouri and illinois they had
appealed to the united states govern-
ment for aid but the washington poli-
ticians had turned a deaf ear to them

  then came the mexican war

  the mormons were already on the
move by the time the war started they
were seeking a haven of security in the
promised land of the far west preferably
california

  when the war broke out the mormon
leaders proffered men to aid in the sub-
jugation of california in return for certain
concessions of rights of settlement

  eventually the offer was accepted and
captain james allen of the regular army
went into the mormon camps scattered

is all tangier getting married then
but he was a good soul and had just
taken his own second woman so he
was inclined to be indulgent at his word
his subordinates threw open the gate

  go with allah he called waving the
two parties forward

  thus la marnia in one bridal box
passed through the city gate into the
security of the anjera while a lateef
her rightful owner followed in another

the thicket

woodward

all the way from nauvoo illinois to
council bluffs on the missouri to recruit
soldiers

  somehow the word was spread about
that the united states was going to re-
cruit the finest of the mormon men and
these men were to be sacrificed on the
battlefield to cut down the strength of the
saints

  hence the mormon battalion of five
hundred men that was eventually as-
sembled at council bluffs was looked
upon by many of the embittered mor-
mons as a ram in the thicket like
the sacrifice in the ancient biblical story

  however strictly speaking the story
was not true and brigham young and
the other mormon leaders looked upon
the opportunity to serve the united
states and at the same time establish
the vanguard of mormon immigrants in
california then the promised land as an
intervention of providence

  on july th  the battalion took
up the march from council bluffs to fort
leavenworth to save money they
a ram in the thicket



agreed to turn back to their families the
years clothing allowance advanced them
this amounted to  each per year
this fund was used to purchase supplies
for the families left behind who were
allowed to take up quarters on grand
island in the platte river hence the
battalion marched off on its two thousand
mile hike clad in civilian garments by
the time the detachment reached cali-
fornia many were wearing breech cloths
their shoes were gone and they wore
sandals or wrapped tattered rags about
their feet

  from leavenworth the outfit marched
to santa fe via the cimmeron route at
santa fe colonel philip st george
cooke assumed command of the bat-
talion he was a crusty regular army
officer who had graduated from west
point in  and had seen service in the
black hawk war and on the plains

  it must have galled his regular army
heart to handle his battalion of undis-
ciplined undrilled poorly equipped and
ill clad mormons the majority of whom
were smarting under the hardships en-
dured for their faith in illinois and
missouri

  yet both men and colonel came to
understand each other before that gruel-
ling hike was done

  the men unused to army discipline
were prone to talk back to the colonel

  it is related that one infantryman
ordered to swim a river on a mule to seek
a ford for the remainder of the outfit
tested the strength of the current and
finding it too deep and swift told the
colonel hed see him in hell before hed
drown himself and the mule apparently
all the rebuke he received was a comment
on the colonels part that the infantryman
was a saucy fellow

  the only battle the battalion had en-
roll te was with a herd of wild bulls which
occurred near the san pedro river in
december there were many wild cattle
ranging that portion of the country and
a herd of bulls either from curiosity or
natural ferocity charged the column
goring pack animals and the mounts of

the officers the soldiers opened fire and
killed between sixty and eighty of the
brutes before the animals would leave
them alone

  the country through which the bat-
talion marched was dry desert land the
wagons often became stuck in the sand
and at such times twenty men tailed
on to the ropes to drag the vehicles
through the soft places their clothes
began to fall from them sickness at-
tacked them and all the medicine they
received was calomel and arsenic

  yet in spite of the hardships they
pressed on california the promised
land was ahead of them

  they crossed the colorado and for five
days struggled with the hellish desert
wastes of what is now the imperial valley
this was the hardest portion of the entire
journey finally after many had dropped
exhausted by the wayside the command
reached the alkaline waters of carrizo
creek the worst of the desert trip was
over

  thence by easy stages they marched
by way of the san felipe valley hewing
a wagon route through solid rock to
warners ranch and finally out upon the
pacific by way of the san luis rey
valley

  the horrible march was done

  the battalion never fought in any of
the engagements of the war they did
garrison duty at san diego at mission
san luis rey and at los angeles when
the men were mustered out of service
many went to salt lake others settled
in california mormon picks and shovels
dug the mill race in which james marshall
discovered the lumps of gold that set the
world on fire incidentally it is the entry
in the diary of henry w bigler a mem-
ber of the battalion who was working
at sutters mill that gives the true date
of the discovery january  

  at the present time it is believed that
there is not a single member of the
battalion alive but the memory of a ram
in the thicket is very dear to the hearts
of the mormon people for they were the
pioneers
an unusually poignant
story of men in war

a valor ruined man

by norman reilly raine

stretched out on his chicken
wire bunk with a haversack under
his head starling commander
of c company looked up sharply
from his reading as a mud plastered run-
ner from battalion headquarters pushed
aside the gas curtain and entered the
dugout he handed starling a message
and stood rigidly at attention blinking
in the candle light after the gloom of the
trench starling flipped open the enve-
lope read the message initialed his
acknowledgement and when the runner
had departed warmed with rum he read
it again-slowly then his eyes dropped

to a passage in his book a tattered copy
of moby dick a breath of the free
open sea that somehow had found its
way into the winter trenches

  that immaculate manliness we feel within our-
  selves so far within us that it remains intact
  though all the outer character seems gone
  bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped
  spectacle of a valor ruined man nor can
  piety itself at such a shameful sight com-
  pletely stifle her upbraidings against the per-
  mitting stars

starlings fine eyes puckered lost them-
selves in the damp shadows of his cave
after a space he summoned his orderly
my compliments to mr blake of the


a valor ruined man



th platoon ask him to report here
at once

   blake came his pinched faced red with
cold stamping and slapping the fresh
-snow from his boots and trench coat he
straightened in the candle light and
essayed a smile but his heart thumped
with trepidation starling spoke with
calculated matter of fact cheeriness

  battalion has given c company a
job-daybreak patrol to go out this
morning youre next on the slate
blake so youll take it jerrys got a
machine gun in that ruined red house at
c-ll-a-- take eight men and a
lewis gun and shift him youll go with
them of course

  the younger mans head was bent
he did not look up but the blood rushed
to his face then ebbed swiftly leaving it
pasty white his stomach trembled with
dread he lied miserably knowing that
starling knew he was lying yet powerless
to control himself his shaking fingers
plucked at his lips

  i- could you-could you detail
some one else sir im not feeling just-
a touch of trench fever shame over-
came him

  god starling i cant dont you
see its not fair to the men

   men of starlings caste do not recog-
nize cowardice as such-they acknowl-
edge only degrees of courage blake had
been a good soldier in the early days at
loos and after and he was only
twenty-two starlings gaze buoyed him
up returned to him a shred of his self
respect he said casually

  ill have to send johns then he
likes patrols sorry youre not feeling fit
blake this is the second time and i
dont want the company talking keep
your heart in it lad send the sergeant-
major down when you go up

   blake returned to his platoon

  at dawn the patrol under johns went
out shadowy figures crouching through
the mist an hour later they tumbled
back in the fire trench jubilant with two
casualties and five prisoners their job
well done

  at the end of its tour the battalion
was withdrawn and billeted near poper-
inghe and starling did what he could in
his quiet unobtrusive way to buttress
blakes courage the others cracking
nerves found strength and comfort in his
company commanders steadfastness and
understanding his spirit revived in the
safety of the present and starling began
to have hope

        c company officers messed
together in the kitchen of an
abandoned farmhouse and
after the drab monotony of the
trenches they made their brief holiday a
merry one on the last day out of the
line they sat about the dinner table
starling at the head lean and bronzed
his deep kindly eyes reflecting the smile
under his thin mustache beside him was
blake his mind at peace in spite of the
fact that they were moving up into the
trenches the following night the others
were smith and patterson subalterns of
the th and th platoons hyde-bennett
who was a guest from a company and
no  platoon commander johns johns
was a hearty red faced bulk of a man
whom a bullet through the vocal cords
had endowed with a feminine voice he
was a formidable and ruthless fighter and
was worshiped by his men who called him
bloody mary

  hyde-bennetta genial irishman spilled
whisky into his glass

  nice bag of prisoners you fellows got
in your raid the other morning he said
i was on leave last time in but i heard
about it

  bloody mary chuckled

  it wasnt a raid major it was a
blasted patrol sorry we didnt get their
officer too let me tell you its rather
funny we went out at daybreak and
down the sunken road that runs through
our wire to the railway embankment
we hadnt gone a hundred yards when
my sergeant heard something we
flopped and lay still then i crawled up
the bank and had a dekko on the other
side there was an enemy patrol by gad

resting they were cramming them-
selves with wurst or some such muck
before working up to have a peep at us

i	sent the lewis gun up the bank then the
rest of us skulked through the culvert and
said good morning youd have laughed
they put up a scrap of course and it was
rather sordid for a minute or two then
their officer-only a kid he was-gave a
squawk and legged it off up the road
left his men flat by cripes youre a hell
of an officer thought i and up the road
after him well i caught him

  starling who happened to glance at
blake cut in swiftly

  shut your trap mary and pass the
whisky

  johns waived the interruption with a
grin

  i caught him-right in the angle of the
red house his liiger might have been
cheese for all the use he tried to make of
it he backed into the wall his eyes
bugged out with fright and when he saw
me so close he shrieked like a bloody
guinea pig they heard him clear back
at the culvert i let him squeak for a
second or two then my bullet got
him- bloody mary indicated a point
under his left jaw-just there it blew
a hole in his coconut you could-

  starlings voice rapped out again un-
mistakable in its sharp command

  shut up johns

  bloody marys eyes opened wide

  what for he demanded aggrieved
the little stinker deserved it didnt he
letting his men down god how i hate a
quitter

  blake jumped to his feet his face chalk
white he murmured something and his
chair tumbled backward as he made for
the door

 hullo whats wrong with old
blake patterson asked

  hes been under the weather a bit
lately starling said never mind him
hell be all right presently

  bit of red flannel next his bellys what
he needs johns sympathized fine
thing red flannel i remember one time
near mons  

  starling found blake in his bunk weak
with nausea

  its no good sir he moaned im
done in this trip in the line will finish
me

  he buried his face in his hands
starling sat with him until dawn but
blake had spoken truth

the next day blew in on

the wings of an icy gale snow
laden an hour after a hot
midday dinner the battalion
moved up it was dusky and shrapnel
crashed over the grand place as the long
column wound through the pitted streets
past the stark uplifted finger of the cloth
hall and out along the menin road to
the death haunted bog of the ypres
salient the wind had dropped but
snow fell steadily in large wet flakes
each plodding infantryman moved under
a little blurred canopy of white the
savage thunder of gunfire was softened
the trend of the heavily burdened fighting
men cushioned by the fall the delicate
beauty of ruined eaves vignetted in the
half light drew comments in voices
husky with false cynicism

  starling fell out by the side of the pave
and watched his beloved troglodytes
stumble past laden with fighting equip-
ment firewood water wire and odds and
ends of comforts and necessities for the
winter trenches he passed an encourag-
ing word or two then fell in with blake
as his platoon came past

  how is it going don he asked
casually

  blake turned a white face in the gloom
shook his head said nothing

  starling wrapped his fingers with sane
even pressure around the others arm and
squeezed

  hang on boy he said gently
take hold of yourself we go on
divisional rest after this trip in and that
means three weeks out of the line

  there was an undercurrent of thrill in
his voice

  a hidden battery slammed from a
nearby copse and blake jumped
a valor ruined man



  steady man starling warned
its our own guns keep your teeth into
it dont let your men down youll be
all right

  with a last friendly grip the company
commander regained his place in the
column

  the battalion turned off to the right
some distance beyond the ramparts
through a portal of twisted iron and shell
riven poplars and out over the white open
fields toward the railway dugouts and
zillebeke lake men strung out into
indistinct heaving files

  shell hole on the left    wire under-
foot    wire overhead    shell hole

  the litany of guarded warning traveled
continuously back along the column
ghostly flares wavered skyward from the
front line at hill  and santuary wood
and hooge

  scattered shells began to drop in the
fields behind and just ahead where the
communication trench began the shell-
ing grew heavier casualties occurred in
the leading company an orderly came
back to take cover in the nearby dugouts
until the hostile fire slackened starling
made his way along his company passing
the word when he came to no 
platoon a question jumped to his lips
only to be stifled blake was not with
his platoon

  starling summoned his second in com-
mand

  take over and get the company under
cover he directed i have a little job
to do ill be back presently

  he watched them get under way his
mind casting about for a line of action
panic tugged but he stamped it down
then as by inspiration he remembered
that a half mile back along their track
was an abandoned gun emplacement
swiftly he calculated the time it would
take to reach it it was not likely that
the battalion would move for another
half hour and in any case it could be over-
taken in the communication trench
starling plunged back along the battalion
track

  it was quite dark but the falling snow

seemed to shed a soft aura of its own he
had a feeling of intense isolation the
waves of gunfire receded to a sonorous
murmur rimming the silent fields and old
trenches and straggling wire seemed to
creep toward him reaching with ghostly
fingers as though in search of the re-
assuring presence of life

  from somewhere close by a battery of
heavy howitzers coughed and immedi-
ately upon the reports came the quick
scream and burst of an enemy shell
starling flung himself down and dirt
showered over him it hardly had settled
when another landed and another-wide
this time searching for the battery
starling hurried past the danger spot
again the rush of displaced air warned
him and he dropped

  in the act of getting to his feet he
checked himself suddenly regardless of
another warning scream the concussion
knocked him headlong but he scrambled
upright and raced toward a faint glimmer
of light that he had seen issuing from
beneath the ground a light in these old
gun pits deserted by all but scavenging
rats meant one thing only

  he fell heavily into the remnant of
trench and ran along it looking for an en-
try he found it by tumbling down a short
flight of broken steps into a low vaulted
cellar with part of the roof blown away

blake was sitting on an am-
munition box in the flickering
light of a candle stump his
equipment strewn on the
ground about him his eyes black pools
of utter defeat stared with grim and
awful purpose down the barrel of his
service pistol

  wordlessly starling hurled himself for-
ward and clapped his left hand over the
muzzle the weapon roared a thin
curtain of acrid smoke arose between them
and starling raised his red shattered
hand blake swayed stupidly to his feet
reeled backward then jerked upright his
face a mask of horror in the candle light

  oh god what have i done he
gasped


norman reilly raine

  starling set his jaws against the agony
and fumbled for his field dressing he
managed words

  dont waste time get your equip-
ment on and get back to your platoon
its at the railway dugouts move man

  frantically inadequately he pulled at
his tunic where was that damned
bandage

  blake stumbled toward him half
crying

  here-let me do it he mumbled
half-way he stopped and his head
jerked up

  get down starling he screamed and
bore him to the floor

  dimly starling was aware of his
weight the gun pit dissolved in a moil
of stone dust and flame

the president of the
court had read the charge

  the accused captain john
anthony starling second bat-
talion the royal murkshires is charged
with misbehavior before the enemy in
such manner as to show cowardice in that
he at ypres when his battalion was pro-
ceeding for duty in the trenches did
absent himself without leave

  two that he did subsequent upon
the above occurrence commit upon him-
self a self-inflicted wound with intent to
evade duty with his battalion

  the room was still a hard driving
rain freezing as it fell assailed the tall
windows of the chateau the poplars in
the courtyard creaked and swayed before
the late winter gale like surf against
iron cliffs the sullen diapason of gunfire
penetrated the room punctuated by
nearer thuddings the embers in the
grate settled with a little rustle the flame
leaping rosily over the heavy furniture
then it subsided

  starling wrenched his mind from
futilities from the throbbing flesh under
his bandage from the utter impossibility
of defense against this monstrous charge
his eyes rested in turn upon the president
of the court an impassive face not un-
kind the j udge-advocate toying with a

  ruler small and dark conveying despite
his atmosphere of inns of court a certain
pawky humor members of the court all
of a type-service worn khaki incisive
lips clear health flushed skins their eyes
crowfooted from days and nights of
bloody vigil in the trenches men of
starlings own kind

   his eyes came to rest on the prosecutor

  captain neylan was an oldish man-a
combatant officer lately promoted to
staff the war had interrupted his bril-
liant career as a prosecuting lawyer whose
fetish was facts and when he had piled
up sufficient facts of the right sort the
culprit inevitably was imprisoned or
hanged in neylans life sentiment did
not exist one was guilty or one was not
-facts do not lie besides separating
him from his career the war had told
upon his temper there was a trace of
acid in his thin infrequent smile and as
he definitely disapproved of a certain
laxity permissible in court-martials favor-
ing the prisoner he made his tolerance of
such well meant blunderings obvious
but this fellow starling was so patently
guilty that even he the accused had re-
fused to accept any palliation of the facts
and had resisted every effort of the court
to help him thus thought the man upon
whom starlings eyes were fixed

  the presidents voice dropped like a
pebble into the pool of silence

   guilty or not guilty

   not guilty sir

   even as he said it starling realized its
uselessness if only he could meet these
men in the easy atmosphere of a regi-
mental mess how quickly he could make
them see here they were emotionally
suspended gripped in the impersonal
functioning of a military-legal machine
he had to admit facts and facts were
damning the prosecutor was elaborat-
ing the charge

  while under fire on the way to the
trenches the accused disappeared he
reappeared later at the regimental aid
post with a pistol bullet through his left
hand mark that gentlemen a pistol
bullet far behind the front line prisoner
a valor ruined man



  states that it was not self - inflicted
medical evidence says that the wound was
received when the hand was less than one
inch from the muzzle of the weapon we
have the evidence of captain starlings
subalterns and second in command as to
his absence it was reluctantly given but
it is there one alone did not testify-an
unfortunate young officer named blake
who is presumed to have been totally de-
stroyed by a shell while the regiment was
moving up we must not ignore the
character evidence by the prisoners
battalion commander-captain starling
was a competent and courageous officer-
even though the witness displayed rather
more warmth in rendering his evidence
than was justified by later facts un-
doubtedly captain starling was a keen
soldier still there are the facts which the
prisoner himself does not deny there
were no actual witnesses of the deed of
course but when circumstantial evidence
is so strong guilt must be presumed
the president leaned forward

  have you anything to say captain
starling

  starling thought deeply he thought
of his battalion and somewhat of himself
but mostly he thought of blake who not
too late had redeemed himself

  i can only say sir that i did not try
to evade duty with my battalion and i
did not shoot myself

  that is all of the defense you offer
  that is all

  the prosecutor sensed the feeling of the
court starlings manner had told he
shot forward his jaw

 why were you absent from your
battalion at such a time

  i was on a self-imposed mission in-
volving the honor of my battalion

  the prosecutor permitted himself a
smile in the direction of the president
but that old connoisseur of men was in-
tent upon the prisoner

  the prosecutor continued-

  what was that mission

  i decline to answer

  i insist

  the president of the court turned from

  his contemplation of starlings pale firm
lips

  captain starling has told us that it
involves a question of honor he said
very quietly

 the prosecutor flushed deeply he
returned to the attack

  your wound was not self-inflicted

 no

  was it accidental

  yes

  was it done by human agency

  yes

  who did it

  i decline to say

 you mean although knowing your
very life may depend upon giving the
court that information you still decline

  starling breathed deeply his knuckles
whitened

  yes i decline

 the windows shook in their frames
under the distant drumfire somewhere
a tiny clock tinkled the hour

  that will do captain neylan the
president said

sentence for cowardice in
wartime is not always death
much is left to the discretion of
the court and much is taken
into account and a recommendation for
mercy invariably brings results men
have escaped with imprisonment for life
or for shorter terms and upon occasion
have been set free to return to the con-
tempt of their fellows

  starling was cashiered and being the
type of man he was he immediately en-
listed as a private in a line regiment
under his own name when he returned
to france he was a corporal among the
slag heaps and shell craters of loos
sergeant starling led the remnant of his
platoon in bloody assault against a strong
point carried it and held it against cruel
counter attacks for sixteen rather heroic
hours then promotions bony finger
moved and john anthony starling was
again an officer and-quaint thought-a
gentleman

  it was shortly after that he once more


norman reilly raine

met the prosecutor who was then staff
major of a neighboring brigade there
was nothing much to the meeting really
neylan was a visitor to starlings bat-
talion mess and was discussing a point of
training with his host when starling
entered the room

  to my mind the host was saying
over a glass of whisky and soda the
lewis gun has been of great value in
teaching the men-hello heres star-
ling come here john i want you to
meet-

  yes interrupted neylan thought-
fully gazing through starling into in-
finity the lewis gun is a useful weapon
so for that matter is the service pistol-
in the proper hands you cant get away
from that fact

  that is all there was to it but starling
being the dull obstinate fellow he was
applied for and was granted a transfer to
a battalion in neylans brigade just in
time to take punishment in the epic fight
for passchenstrafel ridge

  ponderous howitzers squatted in the
mud and roared endlessly one lone
planked road stretched over the morass
bracketed by bursting shells shell holes
filled to the brim with stinking water the
only homes the weary fighters knew were
churned by high explosives into a revolt-
ing bog that stretched into the dusk as far
as eye could see the ridge gray and
brooding in the rain and the murk stood
a grim barrier against further progress
at its feet glistened the viscid pools where
men had died in thousands in a fruitless
morning attack enemy wire cunningly
laid under mud and water in a swamp at
the foot of the slope had entangled the
infantrymen as they rushed forward to
the assault small hope for human life
under the murderous fire from the crest
and the rolling barrage that immedi-
ately dropped on them and smashed
them in their helplessness until hope was
not and terror was numb those of the
attackers who were not shot to bits had
drowned in the mud and now it was
night and brigade headquarters was
frantic	

  the situation at the front was obscure
enemy shellfire methodically destroying
communication lines and roads as fast as
they were laid and until definite infor-
mation was forthcoming it was im-
possible to plan another attack there
were rumors that part of a battalion had
got through the swamp and was cut off
fighting desperately on the ridge all day
and until long after nightfall neylan
who had gone forward to glean what in-
formation he could found himself at two
oclock in the morning in an improvised
dugout of the signal corps-a reeking hole
in the mud-with a battalion commander
of the aberdeens the place was being
pounded by high explosives the tele-
phone buzzed madly and the signaler ap-
peared to be in difficulty

  what the devils the matter neylan
snapped whos trying to get through
the man turned a perplexed face
youd better take it sir i cant make
out what theyre driving at

 neylan snatched the headpiece
listened questioned briefly then he
jumped up and turned to the infantry
commander

  its a forward observation post re-
porting signals from the face of the ridge
with an electric torch sir some lunatic
is defending a pillbox he captured this
morning against continual attacks how
he got his men through that ghastly
swamp god knows lets go up and see
what its all about

in a lull between bursts
they got to the top there was
rain and icy darkness but the
road gave them direction and
twenty minutes brought them to the front
line-a series of sheilholes-thinly held
by machine gunners huddled soaked and
shivering but alert under inadequate
tarpaulins one of their officers a young
man who seemed to see like a cat in the
dark pointed into the gloom ahead

  it was from directly in front and near
the top of the ridge i judge that the
signal came he told them as they
splashed about in the uncertain foothold
a valor ruined man



  i think- there it is again

  out of the dark and the rain from the
sinister loom of the great ridge came a
series of flashes-pinpoint dashes and
dots of light

             

 its morse-sos the machine
gunner said

  desperately the little garrison in the
beleaguered pillbox sent their message
into the night

  holding pillbox near chest  yds west
  op road stop thirteen all ranks stop
  ammunition low stop believe enemy
  strength light stop can guide supports
  under cover darkness through swamp for
  dawn attack and smash his defense stop
  i will meet supports crater pillbox your
  edge of swamp at five oclock a m stop
  god sake come stop

  the light flashed once or twice again
evidently the beginning of a signature
but faded to a tiny indecipherable glow
then died

  battery gone the aberdeen colonel
grunted by god hes a soldier who-
ever he is i heard that nearly a company
had got cut off up there only thirteen
left what can we do

  representing brigade the decision was
neylans he thought rapidly

  well use your battalion sir he said
theyre fresh comparatively and they
ere close at hand it may be only a trick
of course but well have to chance that
if we can get a battalion through that
swamp and into a jumping off place on the
slope we should take the ridge an hour
after dawn lord what a chance after
that awful mess of yesterday

  youll find us ready the highlander
replied curtly

  ill have brigade take steps to follow
us up then the aberdeens had better
move into position on the left of the plank
road about five hundred yards in rear of
crater pillbox then you and i will
move up and meet this fellow and make
sure of things before we commit our-
selves

  an hour and a half later the kilted

aberdeens heads bent beneath the pelt-
ing downpour plodded through mud and
darkness toward the ridge no talking
no smoking was the order and the
hardened dour fighting men moved in
purposeful silence at their head neylan
and their battalion commander stumbled
and splashed keeping direction with
utmost difficulty incessant flashes of
gunfire played like sheet lightning through
the dripping night and occasionally the
column was halted by bursts of heavy but
sporadic shellfire ahead they arrived in
position and company by company the
battalion disposed itself in shellholes

  if you are ready sir neylan said
well take a couple of runners svith as and
carry on to crater pillbox this brush
track runs right past it there will be
plenty of time to send word back to the
battalion if it is to move up

  two battalion scouts were detailed to
accompany them and the little party
plowed on after a time one of the
scouts reported a deeper smudge in the
blackness-crater pillbox and as they
swung slightly to the right and made for
it they saw it suddenly ringed by dull
glowing spots of bursting flame

an express train hurtled
overhead and dropped a
shower of mud and debris
pelted them three more a
full salvo in all up to their necks in
waterlogged shellholes they took cover
crump crump crump crump a
barrage fell on them the tortured earth
spouted fountains of mud and steel and
flame the din was colossal between
the bursts neylan heard the deep groans
of some one badly hit he shouted and
his mouth was stopped by flying mud
desperately he floundered out of his shell-
hole reckless of the whistling death all
about and groped blindly through the
uproar searching for his companions
they were gone he alone was left he
staggered blindly forward in the direction
of the concrete pillbox felt the cobbles of
a road beneath his floundering boots
with red fury destruction rained from the

sky and by a hundred miracles he escaped
it where was that cursed pillbox it
was cover he had to find cover his
whole instinct of self-preservation was
bent upon it yet it could not drive com-
pletely from his mind a thought of that
desperate leader of a forlorn hope waiting
for his support

   out of the screaming blackness a shell
 burst showed him a glimpse of a dugout
 entrance in a pulverized trench he
 dived headlong into it and scrambled
 down the rubbish littered shaft he knew
 it for one of the jumping off places of
 yesterdays attack here for a time he
 would find safe harbor if a direct hit did
 not land on the exit and bury him alive
 when the storm had cleared he would
 carry on bruised and terribly shaken he
 scooped the streaming muck from his
 eyes and face the earth above and
 around him trembled and rocked under
 the impact of huge projectiles he
 fumbled for a match to see his watch and
 unheeding cut his finger on the broken
 crystal and twisted metal guard well he
 could guess the time and that fellow
 would have to wait nothing could live
 in the hurricane of steel above he
 crouched with thumping heart as part of
 the wail fell in and the stout roof timbers
 cracked under the burst of a shell god
 that was close so was that another of
 those and hed be done for beneath thirty
 feet of earth

   he listened and presently his trained
 ears told him of the gradual slackening
 of the barrage it was just a routine
 strafe probably put down on the chance
 of catching troops moving up to attack
 how narrowly the aberdeens had missed
 it and their colonel   

   better get out of this and on with his
 job it must be after five he wondered
 if the other man had lived through it in
 the sound shelter of the pillbox probably
 he had outside was comparatively
 quiet now painfully he clawed his way
 up over the loose rubbish and more
 noisome waste of the battered shaft he
 had almost gained the top when the con-
 cussion of a shell burst in the trench out-

 side blew him back and cracked his skull
 against a beam he rolled over and lay
 motionless half way down the shaft

the watery light of early
morning was pouring through
the narrow entrance when
neylans swimming brain
fought its way back to consciousness
he staggered to his feet and crept by
agonized degrees toward the open one
thought only dinning through his con-
fused mind-a thought that somehow
took him in the pit of the stomach like a
blow it was full day almost and what
of the attack

  outside he straightened with difficulty
and looked about him behind was a vast
churned sea of earth thousands of shell
holes reflecting the steel gray sky dazed
incredulous he saw horses and ammuni-
tion limbers guns and infantrymen mov-
ing forward a host of them crawling
across the mud he turned to the ridge
its crest was a feather of spouting flame
but on the near slope tiny khaki blobs
worked upward in battle formation
stunned he watched them as they dis-
appeared in small groups into the smoke
of the crest supported by the thundering
fire of a thousand guns and as his hag-
gard unbelieving eyes swept the fore-
ground to the grim bulk of crater pillbox
he saw coming toward him over the
pitted road five scarecrow figures moving
with the shambling limp armed gait of
utter weariness

  they were caked in blood and slime
and their blackened faces were those of
men who had dwelled long in the valley
of the shadow at their head marched
one helmetless taller and more ragged
than the rest whose uncertain feet were
kept to the road only by force of an in-
domitable will and whose eyes red holes
in a mask of clay burned with un-
quenchable light neylan did not need to
be told they were the lone survivors of
the ridge and their leader was starling

  the former prosecutor sickened with
the terrible realization of his own position
his duty had been to keep the rendezvous
t

a valor ruined man



at all cost he had failed while these
men and their mates had been fighting
and dying like gods depending on him for
rescue he had been safe under cover
and starling whom he had once nailed to
the cross with facts had caught him
creeping out of a dugout hours after the
danger had passed

  when starling halted his men dropped
their rifles and sprawled on the muddy
road to rest their commander stood
upright swaying gently on widely planted
legs neylan felt his eyes upon him and
the hot color surged to his face and neck
what could he say how could he
plead urgently he felt the need of
pleading

  but when he raised his head starlings
look was not upon him it was turned to
the battle torn heights beyond and
when their gaze did meet the ragged
soldiers eyes were washed clean of all but
a transcendental happiness

 look neylan god man look
weve taken the ridge

  a gusty sight that came from his inner-
most heart blew through the cracked lips

  its a miracle last night that bar-
rage- i knew you couldnt get through
it but my chaps were waiting for me

back on the ridge so i dodged through
and by amazing luck stumbled over the
colonel of the aberdeens he was badly
cracked up and thought you were killed
but he told me where his battalion was
i found em and after the fire lifted we
moved up i had blasted a way through
the swamp with bombs and it served
the aberdeens got into position with the
rest of the brigade to back em-thanks
to your work im told and after wed
seen the attack get under way- well
here we are weve dwindled a bit but
were all more or less sound what hap-
pened to you though knocked out i
thought you had been damned tough
missing the fun eh by the way-do
you happen to have a tot of rum in your
bottle my fellows here   

  the staff man cried out

  good god you dont understand
man while you were doing my job and
your own too i was deep in a bloody
dugout safe never mind the reason
you caught me coming out ive got to
face facts especially after the way i
hounded you

  facts to hell with facts said star-
ling wearily i asked you if you had
any rum

the price of the racket

the even roar of the hundred
and eighty horsepower motor
was broken briefly by a sort of
cough george groody leaned
forward tensely his eyes darted from
gage to gage on the instrument board
ahead of him his heart seemed to jump
and then it started pumping away like
mad

  the next instant the even rhythm of
the eight cylinders had been resumed
the flyer leaned back a sense of great
relief swept over him

  just a bump messing up the carbu-
reter he told himself i might figure
that over a city

  suddenly he was reviling himself sav-
agely why was it that lately it seemed

that every hour in the air was an ordeal
his nerves were shot but he hated to
admit it even to himself when cincin-
nati had come in sight sprawling hugely
in the ohio sunshine he had been con-
scious of a feeling of relaxation it meant
that his objective was very near the
trip had been but an hour and a half
there was no reason for him to feel as if
he had been put through a wringer no
reason that is except the one for which
he hated himself

  as if to escape from his thoughts he
thrust his helmeted head over the side of
the cockpit and surveyed the scene below
he was over the ohio river now coving-
ton like a continuation of cincinnati ran
southward from the bank of the river its
fringe touched the latonia racetrack all
green and white in the sun

  sure is a pretty track groody

 
thought to himself and for the moment
he forgot the burdens mental and physi-
cal which had been oppressing him

  it was sunday morning but the big
racing plant showed many signs of life
dozens of men were walking around the
barns and others were at work on the
track which gleamed whitely the in-
field was a checkered oval hedges
ponds tiny hills and valleys-it was
like an enlarged edition of a glorious
garden

  groodys reckless face relaxed into a
lopsided grin he looked around and met
the eyes of bob corrigan also an ex-army
flyer what was more also a former mem-
ber of the border patrol groody mo-
tioned in the direction of the track cor-
rigan nodded and his rugged handsome
face lighted amazingly as he smiled

  maybe if i take a few afternoons at



the races ill feel better groody re-
flected and if slim evans is right about
that pal of his maybe we can make
enough dough on the ponies to lay oil
flying awhile

  his lean hawk-like face became taut
again unconsciously he had admitted
that he did not feel so well and he hated
that feeling he despised himself for it
nine months of aerial fighting in france
two years in the mexican border patrol
of the army air service assorted flying
of all kinds before and since-and never
before had he been jumpy and nervous
and sleepless

  im worse than an old woman with
indigestion lumbago and the pip he
jeered at himself snap out of it boy
snap out of it

  he found himself gazing around for
emergency landing fields that was right


thomson burtis

and proper but why be so wrought up
about it

  he peered ahead toward the low rolling
hills which finally melted into the higher
slopes of the far famed kentucky moun-
tains somewhere back there was the
field he was to use tom service had
wired him that it was ten miles or so
south of the track   

  there it was and the second ship of
the groody flying circus was dis-
cernible gleaming in the sunshine they
had the small canvas hangar set up
too

  i forgot to look for the fair grounds
groody soliloquized i dont suppose
they can be far away though sure is
better for us to have our field away from
em there wont be ten thousand fool
onlookers and seven million sappy ques-
tions a day

  he throttled the motor to a thousand
revolutions and started a gradual dive
the green and gold ship-a trim little
two-seater with a low landing speed and
a two mile a minute air speed when the
motor was wide open-hummed its way
earthward after years of flying behind
bellowing liberties the roar of the eight
cylinder wright motor was almost a
lullaby painted on the lower wings and
on the sides of the fuselage were the
words-groody flyers

  when the ship was down to a thousand
feet groody could see a dozen people and
two or three cars on the large level
pasture lot

  if an airplane landed in the middle of
the sahara desert a village would spring
up around it overnight he thought to
himself

he felt a hand gripping his
arm and turned around his
eyes followed corrigans point-
ing finger three miles or so
southward on a field alongside the muddy
ohio river were three airplanes drawn
up before a big canvas hangar groody
nodded from his side pocket he took a
very long and very thin cigar and in-
serted it between his teeth unlighted

then he paid attention to the business of
landing

  it was not complicated but he felt
relieved when it was over he landed
with one bounce cursed his awkwardness
and taxied up alongside the other plane
an exact duplicate of his own tom
service who in addition to being manager
of the groody flyers was groodys oldest
and closest friend came out to meet him
there was a letter in his hand the pilot
noticed

  well hows everything groody in-
quired as he alighted from the cockpit
pretty nice field eh these hills make
it a little tough and theyll be tougher if
a motor conks but shes sure smooth
service nodded he was short and very
stocky his round face was adorned by
a huge pair of horn rimmed glasses and
his round blue eyes peered through them
with an effect of unintelligent innocence
his blond hair was cut in a short brush
pompadour which emphasized the fleshy
emptiness of his face

  but tom service was a very deceiving
young man he looked fat actually his
body was as hard as a rock he looked
stupid and boyish both of which appear-
ances were very far from the truth

  everything s-set he said mildly
f-first morning flight tomorrow and
first night exhibition tomorrow n-night
no afternoon flying

  that helps corrigan remarked we
can take in the races then whos the
letter for

  george came by special messenger
the three men looked curiously at one
another as groody took it corrigan
big and wide shouldered took off his
helmet slowly his shock of coarse black
hair sprang upright he was a shaggy
bear of a man but his square jawed face
lighted by turbulent looking brown eyes
was not only forceful but most attractive

  may be another little anonymous love
letter eh barked groody lets see
a short slim dark man with a thin
keen looking face emerged from the small
canvas shelter and sparrow cantoni
pilot of the groody flying circus hastened
handicaps



to join the group as his chief opened the
letter

 there was a moment of silence as
groodys eyes swept over the note he
was standing with slightly bent knees his
lanky body at ease as was customary with
him the unlighted cigar was clamped in
one corner of his slightly twisted mouth
his eyes were narrow and sloped down-
ward from his thin high bridged nose
framed in the close fitting helmet there
was something mocking almost mephisto-
phelian about his aquiline countenance

  little sparrow cantoni said not a word
he merely watched groodys face

  no luck groody said with a relieved
grin that is as far as our unknown
friend with the poison pen is concerned
listen

  dear lieutenant groody

    our mutual friend lieutenant slim evans
  wrote me that he had written to you and that
  we must get together i presume you know
  that slim and i own a racehorse between us

    in addition something has come up since i
  last wrote to slim which makes it very important
  that i see you it will be a pleasure anyhow-
  slim used to talk a lot about you and the old
  border patrol days of course you know hes
  back at mcmullen now and im handling our
  colt as per usual

    we arent quartered at the track im point-
  ing prince regent for one race-the special

  i am at the bluegrass farm less than ten miles
  south of your field could you come over this
  afternoon if you want to fly theres space
  enough inside the practise track here for you
  to land this is a big breeding farm-you
  might enjoy seeing it

                        very truly yours

                      -buddy redfield

 now what could that mean queried
groody looks like they needed help
some way

  what the hell could we do to help em
push a nag in first under the wire
inquired sparrow cantoni

 he spoke in the argot of the
slum streets which had been
the background of his boyhood
his eyes were black as night
in his bony face and there was a world
of sophistication and intelligence glinting
in them his nose was straight and sharp

and he usually talked out of the right
corner of his thin mouth in puttees
boots and oil grimed shirt he looked more
like a jockey than a flyer his black hair
highly polished was parted neatly and
slicked back from his olive face it was
easy to visualize him in different clothes
a sheik of little italy

  groody removed his helmet and lighted
his cigar leisurely he felt better some
way he realized now that he had been
afraid of what that letter might contain
corrigan and service had drawn sighs of
relief too groody however felt almost
as if he had secured a reprieve from some
menacing fate

  he sat down on the grass the dozen
or so people started to get into their cars
group by group

  what we could do to help em out i
dont know groody said smoothing his
close cropped brown hair but it must
be something

  who is this slim evans sparrow
demanded

  he had joined the groody flyers but
recently and was not a full fledged mem-
ber of the circle formed by service corri-
gan and groody he and reilly the
mechanic were still outsiders

  slims still in the army air service
on the border groody informed him
hes an old friend of bobs and mine
and tom here knows him slightly too
all i know is that when he was stationed
up here at cook field he met an old
friend of his-this redfield an ex-jockey
together they bought a race horse named
prince regent turned out a great horse
too seems this redfields a wizard as a
trainer in spite of a bunch of tough
luck they won some big races with him
looks as though this prince regent was
poison to any owner they got him cheap
for some reason and then went through
hell as near as i can understand it to
get the colt a fair break in races seems as
though the world ganged up on em may-
be theyre in the same fix now and i
pinch hit for slim-

  hello-looks like were having com-
pany corrigan interrupted


thomson burtis

   one of those ships we saw i imagine
groody remarked

  a mangy looking jenny-low powered
wartime training ship-had scudded into
view flying low over the rolling hills which
hemmed in the field it landed easily and
taxied up to the circus flyers a burly
figure in breeches puttees and flannel
shirt got out of the cockpit he was
flying without a helmet and had his
goggles pushed up against his mouse
colored spike-like pompadour

   groodys eyes narrowed until they were
mere lines f light below his quizzically
arched eyebrows

	for some reason he opined that
bozo looks familiar to me

   the approaching pilot was a giant of a
man-as tall as groody and almost as
big bodied as corrigan his shirt was
open at the neck disclosing a bull-like
neck which supported a square somewhat
battered face his nose looked almost
like a prizefighters and his jaw was
square and prominent two deep wrin-
kles between his brows lent an air of
sullenness to the ensemble but it was
dissipated by an engaging smile

   hello george groody he said while
he was still fifteen feet away ill bet
you dont remember me from adam he
had a high tenor voice which seemed
almost ludicrous as it issued from his
bulldog face

groody uncoiled and got to
his feet his long legged body
seemed as lean and tough as
rawhide he was as lithe and
as strong as an uncoiling whip

   youre familiar to me some way he
admitted but ill be damned if i know
from where or why

   well you put me through final combat
training at issoudun then i was with
your squadron at the front for two
days before i got mine names de-
laney  

  oh sure glad to see you again
meet the bunch

   delaneys hazel eyes smiled as did his
wide thick lipped mouth as he shook

hands all around tom service expert in
appraising human nature set him down as
a rough diamond his clothing and face
were grimed with oil and his hands none
too clean but he had a nice smile he
and his ship both had a certain run-down-
at-the-heel look

  delaney unexpectedly got rid of a chew
of tobacco which he had hidden in one
capacious cheek

  in case you boys dont know it he
remarked largely this boy groody
besides getting thirteen germans officially
was chief combat instructor at issoudun
for a while used to go up in a little
nieuport for dog fights with us poor birds
with a cigar just like hes got now in his
mouth in about two seconds hed be on
our tails and five minutes later after
wed looped and dived and spun and
turned until we were so dizzy we were
popping our cakes wed look around and
thered be groody squatting on our tail
like some grinning devil

  i heard he was pretty good service
grinned

  as he looked at his friend his eyes were
suddenly very soft behind the shielding
glasses

  im not in the business of spreading
soft soap delaney declared as he
lighted a cigaret but it was the general
opinion in france that there wasnt any
better in the world

  groody grunted sardonically

  thats taking in a hell of a lot of
territory he said if true it wouldnt
mean anything all the combat expe-
rience i had ought to have shown for
something i noticed i got mine from
some german in the end  

 after youd knocked down two
of his friends delaney reminded him
and then went on what the hell are
you doing in the flying circus business
groody

  what are you doing galloping around
in a civilian jenny countered groody

  im with a three ship passenger carry-
ing outfit-thompsons just gypsy fly-
ing for a while to pass the time away
were here for the racing crowds i saw
handicaps



you billed all over town as booked for the
anniversary exposition and i nearly
dropped dead some classy outfit
hawks huh great ships wish we
had em

  he gazed at the planes for a moment
the spectators had all left reilly a
squat bowlegged round faced irishman
was emerging from the tent struggling
under a load of rope and cable and
a pair of parachutes he threw them
on the ground preparatory to inspec-
tion

  mechanic too huh inquired de-
laney and four flyers and only two
ships   

  tom service here isnt a flyer
groody informed him hes manager
he goes on ahead most of the time
sparrow cantoni we took on recently
he flies and if necessary can double for
most of the circus stunts

delaney flopped to the
ground and every one but
service followed his example
that chunky gentleman was
arrayed as the lilies of the field from wing
collar and bow tie tc polished oxfords
he did not care to risk staining his blue
serge

  you havent told me yet how you
happened to be in this circus business
delaney reminded groody that is if
i aint too curious wish id known it-
id struck you for a job

  its a long story when i got out of
the army a couple of years ago tom
service and i joined up again hes an
old friend he was a major in the army
intelligence service during the war and
then a federal secret agent after it when
i got out of the army he had sort of a
private job on getting the dope on some
crooks with a big carnival he planted
me with it as a flying attraction then
we went down to texas to see if we
couldnt get into oil and met bob cor-
rigan down there knew him in the
army too and he joined up with us
well we made a lot of dough by accident
but we put it all into new acreage that

looked and is still looking great but it
needed a hell of a lot of capital to develop
it see

  we came north to get it and found
out that the only money available was at
such high interest that we might as well
give the skinflints the acreage and let it
go at that then tom and i dug up a
flying circus job with a big ground circus
combination of talents they needed
some detective work done and a business
stimulator besides and they paid us
money enough to keep the works greased
in texas i dont mind the wing walking
stuff and all that so we fell for it and got
bob here to come up from texas to help
out

  after we got through with the show
we couldnt figure any other way to raise
enough money that is without paying
about thirty per cent interest and that
stuff well all be rich out of that tract
we didnt want to sell acreage either
wanted to prove it all up then sell out
to a big company lock stock and barrel
and this circus racket is worth fifteen
hundred a day so we got a booking here
and if our stuff is satisfactory we get a
string of state fairs and what have you-
and can send the required thousand or so
a day down south to keep the wheels
turning

  so there you are a secret service man
managing a flying circus two army flyers
and a civilian pilot working in it and the
whole bunch of us except sparrow damn
near millionaires on paper if we can hold
out great racket eh

  those last words were savagely humor-
ous sometimes the strain of swinging
that proposition in texas seemed unbear-
able   

  so thats the lay said delaney
doing pretty well for yourself i should
say wish i was in your boots-

  say interrupted groody harshly
when i can paint those five foot letters
off the side of those ships and throw that
tackle into the river and burn the last
damn poster that talks about me as
though i was some fat headed actor and
stay out of the air forever-


thomson burtis

    he stopped abruptly corrigans great
 brown eyes were probing into his and
 tom services had become so keen that
 they seemed to be stabbing him groody
 threw away his cigar with a wide sweep of
 his arm

   dont mind my raving he grinned
 i get a lot of fun out of it i-

   lieutenant

    it was reilly he never failed to call
 corrigan and groody by their army
 titles

   yeah what

   groody glanced up at the mechanic
 he felt taut

   the roly-poly irishman seemed to be
 controlling himself with a mighty effort
 his blue eyes were blazing and he was
 shaking his voice choked slightly as he
 said-

    cmon an look at that ladder

    the circus flyers looked at one another
 wordlessly even delaney said nothing
 as they walked the few steps to the spot
 where the ladder was strung out along the
 ground groody walking with his cus-
 tomary bent kneed stride felt that his
 mind was not registering he had no

	thoughts-for the moment-only a numb
 expectancy

    look here sor

   the ladder was a narrow one made of
 heavy wire cable its rungs were also
 of cable but covered with one inch
 pipe

   reilly knelt down and grasped the
 length of pipe which covered the bottom
 rung he pushed it to the left as far as it
 would go groody leaned over to see
 better

    half an inch from the right end of the
 cross cable just far enough in to be
 covered by the shielding pipe when it was
 in normal position the heavy cable had
 been all but filed through a lesser strain
 than a mans weight would snap it

   why-why what the hell de-
 laney stammered whats the mean-
 ing   

    it means groody found himself say-
 ing slowly that those letter writers
 meant what they said

chapter ii

something to think about

for a moment no one but sparrow
cantoni said anything he was
cursing steadily and terribly de-
laney his mouth open was looking from
face to face trying to make sure that it
was all really happening groody cigar
in hand was looking down at the ladder
but he scarcely saw it instead he saw
himself crouched on the upper wing of a
ship leaning against the airstream that
ladder trailing from another plane was
coming toward him he saw himself
grasp that bottom rung with both hands
and then swing free from his precarious
perch

  he shook his head as he felt his heart
bound queerly it was the feeling a
person had at the climax of a bad dream
and it was an unaccustomed one for him

  we might as well have a council of
war he found himself saying

  with one accord the men dropped to
the ground delaney found his tongue

  what do you mean-letter writers is
this stuff an old story lord groody
youd have been dead as a doornail   

  or deader agreed groody tom
hows the old secret service working

  service removed his glasses and polished
them absently his round eyes were like
twin lights now and when he spoke there
was a crisp finality about each word which
was entirely foreign to his ordinary almost
lisping speech groody always felt a
curious sense of confidence when tom was
around in an emergency the chunky
adventurer now looked and acted like the
person he was a brilliant man who could
speak five languages fluently and had a
mind like a well oiled machine his body
itself seemed larger-capable of the things
groody knew it could perform service
was the most efficient rough and tumble
fighter the airman had ever seen and he
had seen a few

  by letter writing service said crisply
we mean that in the last two weeks
weve had two anonymous letters one
mailed from chicago and the other from
handicaps



new york warning groody that it
wouldnt be good for him to keep on this
circus stuff threatened him if he con-
tinued it was the consensus of opinion
that they were the work of an unbalanced
mind and meant little some crazy chap
who resented groody for some reason it
upset us a little but not importantly now
its a cinch that somebody whos keen and
clever and a murderer is at work

  reilly did you leave this tent last
night

  no sor

  was anybody hanging around at all
no sor sparrow was out here until
around midnight but thot wuz all and
i shlept inside the tent on me cot

  when was the last time you inspected
this ladder groody asked

  not since the last toim we used it
sor-a week ago 

  service nodded

  weve guarded things pretty closely
but theres no use kidding ourselves it
might have been done sometime in the
past week-that is there probably have
been short spaces of time when a man
could have slipped in and done it well
check back on that in a minute the
question is-who would want to do such
a thing and why

  that was what groody was wondering
with his lean length stretched out on the
ground and his long eyes mere slits in his
mahogany face he looked like a brooding
eagle he was conscious of jumping
nerves strange bright sunshine a great
city only a few miles away-and he was
feeling like a condemned man nerves   

  say george delaney put in excit-
edly you arent hep to any other flying
outfit thats got a grudge against you or
that was after this fifteen hundred a day
contract are you somebody that might
think if they put you out of the way their
own outfit would get it-

  no service said crisply not a one
of us is acquainted with any other circus
flying outfit and so far as we know theres
none in this section ill check up with
the exposition committee though and
find out whether anybodys been after them

to get our job either before or after we got
on the scene the police can tend to that
if it aint that what could it be said
sparrow cantoni

  might be any one of two things
service said incisively groody was just
listening he did not want to talk some-
how in the first place groody and i
over the past twelve years have individu-
ally and collectively been in places had
experiences and been in businesses which
have made us a lot of enemies some
of em-

  would be capable of anything cor-
rigan nodded

  exactly in the second place it might
be just a nut but that doesnt seem
probable

  bringing it down to the work of an
enemy-some criminal or other-getting
revenge if his object was to murder
groody why would he have written warn-
ing letters giving groody a chance to
quit before he was killed

  keep him from makin the jack sug-
gested cantoni

  the little flyers fingers were twisting
together and his foot was tapping cease-
lessly

  the only reason i could think of too
however groody doesnt quit so the
unknown goes to murder-which doesnt
hang together before trying murder
why wouldnt the man do something mild
like set fire to the ships if keeping groody
from working was his only motive

  or taking the rival flying circus
theory corrigan pointed out why
wouldnt they do the same thing before
going to murder you dont have to kill
an acrobat to keep the act from going on
groody sat up he must snap out of it
suddenly the old jeering smile was on his
face and his eyes were gleaming with
something of the old fire

        tom just what the hell do
you think is the most logical
explanation he demanded
something thatll account for
those letters and this thing here

  the flyer felt as though he could see


thomson burtis

services mind racing along underneath
his blond pompadour

  i believe that there is behind it a dis-
arranged mind of the same type as most
poison pen writers kidnappers and the
like i believe that he would undoubtedly
murder if it became necessary whether
he is an enemy of yours or not from the
past we cant say but im inclined to
think that a tenable theory i believe
that the letters can be explained by the
very premise i mentioned-a disarranged
or unbalanced mind thereve been a
million cases of a similar type of intellect
which writes letters leaves a certain mark
after each crime takes a high sounding
name for himself    you know

  well wed better see the police cor-
rigan stated and pronto this stuff has
got to be guarded to a fare-thee-well of
course

  the big fellow glanced over at groody
groody felt his gaze and met it fairly he
found tom looking at him too why
the whole bunch were staring at him

  whats the matter am i raising a
wart he demanded

  listen george service said crisply
why dont the whole bunch of us take
a layoff and throw up this damn con-
tract

  what do you mean groody asked
him taking out another cigar

  we mean corrigan said bluntly
hows your nerve

  i guess its in good health

  the hell it is youd be inhuman if it
was and you know it

  that was bob corrigan groody re-
flected never had he known a man with
such hatred for hypocrisy or lying the
shaggy headed giant stripped any proposi-
tion or problem to its bare essentials
showed it naked to the world and then
drove home the truth no consideration
of politeness civility or soft heartedness
ever kept corrigan from laying his cards
on the table

  listen here corrigan went on
whats the use of kidding ourselves
tom george here for the past six
months has been doing this damn aerial

daredevil stuff its getting him and it
ought to get him george youre as
nervous as a witch and its a wonder to
me youre not cuckoo

  youre doing it for that oil acreage in
texas tom and i arent doing a damn
thing i was worried about it before all
this happened now by god i say to
hell with the damn oil and take a rest
why kid yourself george you were just
one jump ahead of having no nerves at all
even before that wreck came along and-

  have a bad crash delaney inter-
rupted quickly

  ill say he did corrigan replied

  circus stuff

  no-that was the hell of it groody
said slowly how he wished he could
forget it   

  he was taking a friend of his-an
ex-flyer named harwell in columbus-
for a joyride a couple of weeks ago cor-
rigan explained forced landing rough
field ship did a somersault and squashed
down upside down when we pulled em
out groody was knocked out and harwell
was dead

  and his bride had been watching the
flight put in groody quietly

  lord delaney breathed and there
was honest sympathy in his eyes as they
rested on groody

  youll be stark staring mad if you
dont lay off this stunt flying for a while
corrigan said flatly give yourself a
chance george

  groody chewed on his cigar his mouth
stretched into a bleak grin

  bobs right old-timer service said
gently

  the hell he is groody stated if i
was losing my nerve the only way to get
it back would be to carry on anyhow-

  thats the bunk corrigan inter-
rupted harshly

  sure it is delaney put in he had
been listening with absorbed attention
youve got to be yourself when youre
playing around on wings and ladders
george

  listen boys and girls groody said
slowly
handicaps



  he had been formulating his thoughts
he would like to lay off he dreaded the
next day formerly there had been in his
hazardous tasks a temporary satisfaction
of some ferocious hunger in him which he
could not quite label accurately himself
something like the savage delight a man
took in a good knockdown fight sure of
himself his nerve and his physical
strength and coordination any fear he
might have had had been half pleasant
excitement

  this seems to be an experience meet-
ing he went on mockingly and we
might as well lay our cards on the table
i am fed up but im no cripple in
another two months we make or break in
texas we need dough bad and i for
one am going to have some for the first
time in my life a few nut letters and
this sabotage stuff arent going to turn
me back either we can inspect before
we go up cant we have police protec-
tion and all cant we

  listen tom you too corrigan
the three of us have been batting around
all over the known world for years tom
and i have never had a dime since we
started im getting to the point where i
want a few nickels in my sock in case i
feel like joining another revolution or
something plenty of nickels and by
harry a little old woman stuff inside me
and the rest of it isnt going to turn me
back

from reilly to delaney they
argued with him he remained
adamant in the back of his
head he was thinking and won-
dering all his life he had sought for
some elusive thing which he had never
been able to find it was always just
around the corner what he wanted now
was bound up some way with his present
condition money power in the oilfields
adventure   

  listen the three of you he said
finally dont you get the point here
we are over thirty the bunch of us in
the past we may have all been big now
were gypsy flyers-taking a shot at the

moon and its time the bunch of us got
hold of some of the cheese too hell
tom well never have another such
chance we make or break in a big way
in the next two months forty thousand
more and were set and you think ill
lay off

  ok big boy service said crisply
the entire group relaxed and the
strain was over

  sparrow hike for covington tell the
police the yarn and tell em that well
be here when they send cops out inquire
about having at least one cop on guard
all the time ill tend to the cincinnati
police myself

  right i dont know what good them
flat feetll be anyhow remarked spar-
row whose contempt for all police was
sublime

  he hopped into the hired flivver which
was a feature of the camp equipment and
departed

  delaney would you mind strolling a
little distance away for a second
service asked him theres a little matter
which it wouldnt be fair to mention in
front of you

  sure i hope its something thatll
persuade george here to lay off though
i aint seen you for a long time george
but ill be damned if id enjoy meeting
you dead

  he strode over to the ships well out
of earshot and started to inspect them

  seems like a good egg reilly re-
marked them passenger carryin ships
are sure a fleabitten outfit though no
wonder they aint doin much

  listen reilly service said his eyes
boring into the mechanics in the light
of this ladder here have you ever noticed
anything suspicious about the actions of
sparrow cantoni

  huh gaped the startled irishman
he removed his battered cap and gazed
at service in stunned surprise he
scratched his bald head and his pug nose
wrinkled with emotion groodys eyes
were on service toms eyes were gleam-
ing through his horn rimmed spectacles
jike an owls at night when tom was


thomson burtis

on a trail every fiber of him became
vitalized always his mind would not
leave the problem for so much as a waking
minute until it was solved

  ever seen him fooling with the rigging
or anything was he spending much
time in the tent alone last night service
went on

  ill be damned groody breathed to
himself

  why-why yes sor reilly stam-
mered finally come t think of it oi
did see him foolin with the ladder and he
was inside whistlin away fur some toime
but honest sor sparrow wouldnt-

  never mind i dont think he would
either three quarters of the criminals in
the world except the habitual ones you
wouldnt figure to have the possibilities
they do

  whats on your mind demanded
corrigan

  just this it seems to me that this
might more logically be an inside job-
this ladder business you and i and
groody are out of it so is reilly lucky
it was you who found the break in the
ladder reilly or wed be following your
trail that leaves sparrow

 what do we know about him a
mechanic with a good record in the air
service in spite of a few court martials
a whale of a good flyer he came up to
us for a job we needed a pilot tried him
out gave it to him and hes been a good
and faithful pilot

  what else do we know that he was
born in the little italy of new york that
he is familiar with every gangster racket
and dive in the city and that hes as tough
and hardboiled a little wop as ever roamed
the streets of a big city

  but listen sor pleaded reilly
anguish in his blue eyes i been around
a lot with sparrow-you know that
w eve got to be pals honest sor he
worships the ground lieutenant groody
walks on hes told me a thousand
stories about what he heard about the
lieutenant in france and he aggers him
as the best flyer and best guy in the world
honest sor-

  sparrow cantoni worshipping any-
body least of all me is applesauce
groody said

  it isnt corrigan said flatly ive
noticed the same thing myself when
you kid the little egg in that hardboiled
way of yours he gets a look like a petted
dog

  thats a comedy knockout in itself
that little sucker has a piece of rock for
a heart

  maybe so corrigan said doggedly
but a guy like him has his heroes
whether theyre the heavyweight champ
or the best gunman or mussolini and i
believe reillys right when he says that
the little rat looks up to you maybe his
admiration isnt great enough to stand in
the way of his making a piece of change-

  exactly service cut in crisply in
any event we would be fools to overlook
the possibility and there are two possible
motives

he was driving ahead with
the effect of inevitability which
groody always felt in him it
seemed to him that no barrier
of deception could withstand the ceaseless
battering of services mind

  the first is that some enemies of
groodys or mine are willing to pay big
money to have a job done to us and hired
sparrow for the purpose better to bump
us off flying than take the slightest chance
on a bullet sparrow may be a pro-
fessional gunman for all we know as far
as enemies go between my government
work groodys work on the border
patrol and our combined services with
that circus mess and other things weve
accounted for enough powerful criminals
to make it far from an impossibility that
big money might be spent to get rid of us
a man stews in jail for a while and hes
pretty apt to come out with murder in
his heart thats item one

  he took off his glasses polishing them
absently

  the second one would be him as an
individual hes crazy to do the same
stuff that groodys doing
handicaps



  exactly snapped groody
he sat up tensely he was feeling
better as a vague menace changed
slowly to a very possible reality before his
eyes a part of the shadow over his spirit
lightened a definite thing to fight made
life more attractive

  i hate to be steaming in a fog he
went on maybe were doing sparrow
an injustice-i like the little geezer as a
matter of fact-but then again maybe
were not

  what do you mean about his wanting
to do the stuff groody does corrigan
asked

  just that you know it he wants
to wingwalk and all that stuff groody
replied always beggingto

  and we cant let him because we
guarantee to show em a man with thirteen
german planes to his credit service put
in if something should happen to
groody sparrow would be the man-at
commensurate pay he knows were
gambling for fortunes in texas is there
anything to keep him from sitting down
and figuring a way to cut in on our gold
mine

  corrigan shook his head reilly was
staring miserably at the ground

  and far be it from anybody here to
say that sparrows absolutely incapable of
going to the length of framing groody-
but fur murder sor reilly inter-
rupted heatedly maybe fur injury or
somethin but the man thot done this
was up t murder

  i know lets not get off our base
tom said tersely this is a fact we
must suspect sparrow innocent or guilty
and act accordingly he very possibly
is in the pay of the enemy or shooting
for a fortune on his own

  there was a moment of silence reillys
face reflected resentful sorrow as he stared
at the ground groody slowly removed
the cigar from his lips one corner of his
mouth drooped

  for a minute i felt as though i had
my teeth in something and i felt better
he remarked but i just thought of
something a detail as it were

  if sparrow was out to get me for his
own or other peoples purposes he doesnt
need to do much sneaking around on the
ground

  meaning snapped tom

   a little accident in the air   
groodys voice trailed off as his eyes
met the three pairs which were staring at
him corrigan got to his feet as though
he had made a decision

  that settles it he said harshly of
course youre right youre making a
ship to ship change by a ladder well say
just a little dip of the plane a supposed
bump-anything-and youre sunk boys
we call off everything or else we get
another pilot

  wait a minute big boy groody
advised him he too got to his feet and
stalked up and down

  listen he said finally weve got
to go through this one way or another
for the dough and the future contracts
in the second place if sparrows our man
the only way to catch him is to lay a trap
and watch itll be a little inconvenient
for me but it can be done

  if im on guard he cant hurt me
take that ship-to-ship change instead
of me being on the wing of sparrows
ship and you flying the ladder bob wo
just reverse see let him fly the ladder
then i dont leave your ship until i have
a damn good hold on that ladder he
cant hurt me then unless he started
stunting or something and committed
murder in front of forty thousand peoples
eyes

  hell groody corrigan exploded
hotly i wont let you do it under-
stand why damn it   

  sure you will groody told him
tight lipped it wont be so pleasant
maybe but there shouldnt be too much
danger and thats the way to get the
dope i tell you

  corrigan gazed at the ground sullenly
services eyes were boring into groodys
george felt as though tom knew exactly
the way he felt he was nervous and
jumpy stale and next door to being
yellow if it was not for something funda-


thomson burtis

mental-a prize which seemed infinitely
desirable at the end of the road-he would
be so happy to quit for a while that right
then the mere thought seemed like a vista
of paradise

  figure youre up to it george tom
asked quietly

  sure

  then its the best known method to
catch sparrow if he can be caught
service said hell fly right into the net
one way or another if we leave him free
enough so i vote if george is ok to
let things go along taking every pre-
caution

   it may be a tough strain for a flight or
two-but it may save us weeks of worry
a mans got to go to a dentist if he wants
to save himself weeks of pain i wish to
heaven i was the nerve that was going
to be bored at and so do you bob but
groodys got the job

  suddenly the stocky adventurers round
face became bleak and cruel his mouth
was like a cut across his face and he bit
off his words as he said

  but if and when we catch the man
sparrow or no sparrow he may not have
a chance to be a free boarder at some jail
not if i get ten minutes alone with him

chapter iii

thoroughbreds

en minutes later delaney came
wandering back

  i didnt notice that before he
remarked gesturing toward the ships
you got those ships all wired for little
electric lights around the edges of the
wings aint you

  uh huh groody nodded thats
for night exhibitions takes reilly here
a couple of hours to get em fixed

   well boys and girls were all set eh
tom youre going to town i guess id
better go over and see this redfield guy
gosh itd be hard to take if we cleaned
up enough on a horserace to throw this
damn circus business into the ash can
wouldnt it want to go along bob

   id better stay here

  certainly agreed service ill see
the police talk to the fair people and see
what can be found out and what can be
done about it all the exposition birds
wont want anything to happen to us-i
guess well be able to get cooperation all
right

  where you going delaney asked in
his high voice

   over to see the owner of a horse thats
going to race saturday groody ex-
plained friend of mine owns half the
colt and this bird redfield his trainer
the other half

  figuring on a killing delaney asked
eagerly

  dont know yet

   say george let me go along will you
id love to get in on a good thing

  those last words were said so sincerely
that the lanky flyer had trouble repressing
a grin for a second delaney stared at
the ground his bulldog face dark and
brooding

  probably he and his outfit are dead
broke groody thought

  for a moment he hesitated delaney
was certainly moving in he reflected he
was already calling groody george and
the fact that he took a good deal of satis-
faction in being intimate with the circus
flyers particularly groody himself was as
evident as the fact that he was shabby
and probably penniless

  sure groody said finally come
along crank up no  reilly and warm
her will you

  five minutes later groody another
unlighted cigar in his mouth was easing
the hawk off the ground he was tense
and uncomfortable until the hills had been
cleared and he had turned back into a
position to land on the field if the motor
cut out flying of any kind was an
ordeal for him and there was not one
iota of pleasure in it

  he hurtled along above the low rolling
slopes which merged into real mountains
a few miles southward the eight cylinder
wright roared along smoothly and at
fifteen hundred revolutions it carried the
handicaps



sturdy hawk through the air at close to a
hundred and thirty miles an hour it was
a good ship groody reflected landing
speed scarcely more than forty-eight miles
an hour and built so sturdily that no
amount of stunting could hurt it

  he was sweeping the half wooded half
cleared terrain with narrowed eyes how
would he know the breeding farm if there
was more than one they should be
close to it now

  there it was as they swept across
the ridge of sizable hills it lay beneath
them-snowy barns a half mile oval
track and a dozen pastures in which mares
with their foals were grazing peacefully
around the barns negroes were moving
languidly and here and there a horse was
being worked on

  as the ship motor cut circled down-
ward a good many of the high strung
horses used it as an excuse to kick up their
heels and get a bit of exercise as groody
dropped the hawk across the low white
fence around the track he saw a con-
certed movement of galvanized negroes
from the stables they poured over the
fence in a black wave and by the time the
ship had come to a stop they were sur-
rounding it like flies

  groody cut off the gas and vaulted to
the ground a short man so stocky that
he might be called portly pushed his way
through the chuckling somewhat awed
darkies

  george groody he asked in a slow
drawl im buddy redfield

  as groody shook hands and introduced
delaney he was appraising the former
jockey who slim had said could be
trusted to the limit redfields face was
as round as a full moon and almost
lineless he was very brown and when
he smiled he looked positively cherubic
warm brown eyes smiled with his mouth

  maybe he was little once but he out-
weighs me now groody reflected those
jockey shoulders and arms though tell
the tale

  and they did redfields shoulders
were thick and strong and his forearms
were positively huge he was dressed in

riding breeches a white shirt with rolled
sleeves and collar open at the neck and a
leghorn hat with the brim turned down
all the way around shading his curiously
boyish face if the exigencies of making
weight had ever weazened his face and
stunted his body back in the old riding
days there were no signs of them now

  im sure glad to see you redfield
was saying smilingly slim and ive had
a lot of correspondence about you its
cost more for telegrams in the last three
days than it has to feed prince regent
well whats the lay groody de-
manded wait a minute get one of
these boys thats reliable to guard this
ship will you i dont want these babies
to swarm all over her

  two spot if you let one of these boys
touch the plant im sure going to tan you
till youre white

  har har har came a hilarious
chuckle and a bandylegged little negro
waddled out of the mass

  thats our stable jockey grinned
redfield the only rider on earth that
can make prince regent run all two
spots done in spite of the white boys is
win the international match race the
belleview handicap the latonia special
last year and a few other odd stakes

        he must be king of the
kentucky colored kingdom
kgjjllfig groody remarked and red-
field chuckled his assent

  and how he loves it

  as they drifted away from the ship it was
easy to see that two spot was a diminu-
tive black monarch as befitted a jockey
whose name had adorned the headlines
of the sporting world on three separate
occasions

  your letter was received and contents
noted said groody my ears are waving
in the breeze to catch what you say
redfield grinned his eyes flickering
toward delaney with an unasked ques-
tion in them groody turned to the burly
pilot

  dont get sore but redfield and i
have some private business i wont hold


thomson burtis

out on you if theres dough to be
made  

  sure i understand ill sit on the
fence down here a piece

  he was so eager to please that it was
almost pitiful he took a seat on the
fence rail out of earshot of groody and
redfield

  well redfield began in his soft
drawl how much do you know about
slim and me as owners of a one horse
stable

  nothing wait till i set fire to this
cigar and shoot the works

  its like this redfield resumed push-
ing his hat down over his eyes three
years ago i ran into our horse he was
then an outlaw-nobody could handle
him hed been ill treated i guess until
he was scared of men that was prince
regent not worth a dime on a racetrack
just coming three years old and he was
by rex out of the dowager by re-
demption

  as he gave that pedigree it seemed that
he was speaking in respectful awe of
royalty

  what am i supposed to do-stand in
silent prayer demanded groody with a
grin

  redfield chuckled

  no but anyhow thats bred to the
purple of horseflesh bred for speed and
stamina and heart anyway i found out
that prince regent trusted me i could
buy him for a song so i hunted for boys
that the prince wouldnt rear back at
snorting and sweating and try to kill out
of sheer fear and i found little two spot
jackson just a stable boy

  i had a little money slim and i were
friends he had some we bought the
prince on a gamble to make a long story
short in the next two years we won three
of the greatest stakes on the american
track with me training him and little
two spot bringing him home we had
to fight crooked gamblers twice and there
were a lot of heartbreaks but we came
through first year it was my wifes
uncle by marriage-a crooked horseman
named kin beaseley who hated me from

my jockey days when i refused to puli
a horse for him another was a big new
york ring we were meat for em be-
cause prince regent was a horse to be got
rid of when hes right there isnt and
hasnt been since man  war a colt that
could beat him at any distance from six
furlongs to two miles

  thats taking in plenty of territory
groody grunted

  its the simple truth redfield said
quietly but there was unutterable pride
in his voice

  slim and i he resumed had around
seventy-five thousand apiece net at the
end of last season then we put prince
regent in the young handicap at empire
city for a last race he was odds on
favorite we bet a large and luscious
chunk on him all over the country

  he went bad in the race finished third
on three legs we went almost broke and
nobody figured that hed ever be able to
race again weve had him here a year
me putting in full time on him had him
at stud a little which brought in some
dough

  anyhow as far as i can see or any-
body else hes ok again and training
soundly but you never can tell when a
horses legs go bad i believe hes sound
as a dollar his gallops look great every
morning but slim and i between us
havent got five thousand dollars to our
names ive got a house in lexington
but slim-

  hell he probably hasnt got an extra
uniform groody stated

  redfield grinned

  if he has its an accident he ad-
mitted his spending makes a broad-
way butter and egg man look like a
miser from kankakee anyway thats
the situation today follow racing at
all

  i used to be a nut on it but lately
i havent had a chance to follow it at all
i know horses but i dont know the names
of the stake winners since three or four
years ago why

  read anything about the latonia
special next saturday
handicaps



  seems to me ive seen some newspaper
headlines or something

  you probably have from now until
next saturday youll see plenty on the
sporting pages and on saturday youll
see it all over the front pages anyhow
colonel winfield head of the jockey
club is staging another one of his spe-
cials-bringing the leading horses from
all over the country together for a 
purse champs of the east the winter
tracks and tia juana are here or will be
for that race and thats the race im
figuring on for prince regents come-
back

  and the general idea is for me to put
up a lot of dough to bet eh

  redfield nodded for a moment his
candid brown eyes searched the narrow
gray ones which were glinting down at
him groody again was appraising
buddy redfield with attempted cynicism
which somehow would not come off

slim and i figured if you
were making a lot of money we
might make an arrangement
buddy said quietly ill know
the day of the race whether prince regent
is right or not right the bet is a lead
pipe cinch unless his leg goes bad again
if theres the slightest doubt we dont bet
hell be at good odds in spite of the fact
that hes been national champion two
years everybody knows he hasnt raced
for a year which is bad for a horses form
on the first few races everybody knows
his leg went wrong once and may very
possibly go wrong again in the third
place seventy-five per cent of the horses
in the race will have backers anyhow
theyre champs kentuckyll go down
hook line and sinker on the braden
horses those eastern bettersll pile in
so much coin on the whitney entry and
go way the saratoga cup winner that
itll be a shame and the dope i get is
that a bunch of california sports-motion
picture stars and that bunch-are sending
two hundred thousand east to bet on
juniper june barney hutchinsons filly
othersll have backers because theyre all

good i cant see less than four to one on
prince regent in the mutuals

  for a moment groody was silent that
would be forty thousand dollars on a ten
thousand dollar bet-and he could kiss
the flying circus business goodby

  what was your idea of the sharing
terms he enquired

  it isnt just that redfield told him
i figured it would be better if you bought
an interest in prince regent we use
that money to bet with if the horse
wins you and i and slim divide equally
purse and winnings that is if youve
got the money to buy one third interest
how much do you figure hes worth
before he went bad we turned down
a hundred thousand dollars figured him
worth a hundred and fifty if he never
wins another race his breeding and record
make him good for a stud fee of fifteen
hundred at the very least man o war
gets two and a half grand

  but it would take years to get the
money back groody ruminated on
the other hand if he wins its seventeen
thousand from the purse and enough to
take an overnight profit on the whole deal
from bets if he wins  

  on that proposition redfield said
quietly theres something else to figure
any horseman-in fact every newspaper
you read from now to the day of the race-
will admit that prince regent was the
best horse in the world the question is
what is he now

  which is a large inquiry groody said
ill know when he comes to the pad-
dock what he is ive decided this
morning that he needs a tightener for the
big race so im sticking him in an over-
night handicap at the track on wednes-
day therell be several candidates for
the special getting a prep for the big race
prince regent wont win probably be-
cause im not going to have two spot
ride him and he never would run for
another rider gets scared and nervous
and mean

  why not two spot

  because i wont take a chance on
anything happening to him white boys


thomson burtis

gang up on a darkie anything might
happen and if two spot shouldnt be
able to ride special we might just as well
be without prince regent

  anyhow between that race and the
end of the week ill know if the princes
legs stand up in that race hes ok
probably his form i cant be fooled on
because hes honest and no morning
glory

  i buy the share in the horse the day
of the race if you say the word is that
it

  right

  was that what-the only thing i
mean-that you referred to in your letter
to me

  no this whole scheme was figured
out by slim and myself as a means for us
all to make a lot of money before you got
here the letter was about that same
kin beaseley that i mentioned before
huh grunted the surprised groody
hell where do i come in

  i dont know admitted redfield i
guess i just want moral support or some-
thing im scared of him slim and i
beat him once-and had him ruled off the
track for life he cant get into a race
track even to say nothing of running
horses hes my wifes uncle by marriage
as i said

  funny situation groody remarked
hell what can he do to you if he cant
get into a track

  nothing probably redfield said
but two or three days ago i got a letter
from mary my wife saying shed seen
the old crook that he was pitifully down
and out and asking me to forgive him and
help him make a little dough hes com-
ing here to see me some day this week

  he raced horses just to make crooked
money he used batteries framed races
doped em sponged the other horses
bribed jocks-everything a crooked gam-
bler could think of

  the point is this he gives this sob
story to my wife he wants to see me
and i get a rumor-just a rumor-from a
friend of mine that hes secretly interested
in two little stables racing around-one

called the wildflower and the other the
string trained by one eyed farbell

  its just a rumor you say

        uh huh but i got curious
about old kin i hate him
ti but still and all i wouldnt want
even marys uncle by marriage
to starve to death if i could help him
along a little kin used to own a gambling
house in louisville when slim and i
spoiled a crooked racetrack coup in
louisville a couple of years ago we just
about cleaned him for his wad i knew
it was said then that hed sold the house
because he didnt have and couldnt get
capital enough for the house bankroll it
was one of those lay-em-or-take-em crap
layouts anyhow i got a letter yesterday
from a friend of mine in louisville saying
that it was no cinch that kin didnt still
own that house although he might have
taken in partners

  all of which groody ruminated
means that youre not sure that bease-
leys sob story isnt just a lot of apple-
sauce

  exactly nodded the little horseman
quietly then in this mornings paper
i see an item which has got me all haired
up

  such as

  that the wildflower stable with slim
casey trainer and one eyed farbell
have each entered a horse in the special
oho grunted groody but still
what of it even if beaseley does own
a share   

  well one thing about it that might
strike your eye redfield drawled with a
sudden sunny smile is that the horses
theyve entered are two of the worst
pieces of crowbait that were ever fed
heroin to get a stable feed money in a dog
race

  and theyre entered against the class
of the country

  at a fee of a hundred to enter and
four hundred more to start

  groody drew in on his cigar

  neither horse has a chance

  not a chance except for a miracle
handicaps



the wildflower stable entered peggy b
a little sprinting filly that folds up after
six furlongs and couldnt beat  if she
was chased by a lion one eyes got
champ in there champ was one of the
best two year olds that ever ran but then
he went bad proved to be a quitter at the
long distances and for the last two years
has won about two selling plater races a
year when they can get him off in front
and whip him all the way around if
another horse looks him in the eye hes
beat if champ was in his best form up
to his two year old promise he might
have a chance to finish third if all the
other horses in the special fell down or
jumped the fence

   youre figuring on just which
 buddy smiled as though half ashamed
 of himself

  knowing kin as i do and likewise
those two stables i got to thinking some-
thing like this suppose kin did have
some money and owned a share in those
stables suppose he figured on putting
something over in the special his own
horses havent got a chance but they
might do him some good in knocking the
favorite out of the purse by bumping or
something what hed have in his mind
though i couldnt say for sure anyway
though he knows prince regent he
knows if the prince is right hell win so
kin pulls his sob stuff to get in my good
graces get information about the
prince 

   well that seems not so unusual i
cant blame him

  sure but i know kin of course
hates me like hell i feel hes up to some-
thing and that something isnt just a
bet on prince regent if i tell him the
prince is right its a crooked manipula-
tion that hell make a lot of dough on   

   speak of the devil    theres the
 old buzzard now

   down near the barns a stocky figure
had emerged through the gate to the
track groodys eyes dwelt on it with a
lot of interest

  beaseley walked with slow short
strides he was short and so bulky that

his body seemed square groody noticed

his clothes first

  he dont look very prosperous he
remarked

  hed wear overalls if he was a mil-
lionaire redfield told him

  beaseley was arrayed in baggy spotted
blue pants a shabby vest of a different
color from his suit and a dirty standup
collar a size too large for him his
battered felt hat was pushed back from
a square face which might have been
hewn out of granite and then damaged
by the elements

  as he came closer groodys dislike for
him grew the mans light gray eyes
shielded partially by heavily drooping
lids were basilisk-like they protruded
from his face with no more expression in
them than the eyes of an idol the face
was like a harsh mask

   lo buddy beaseley said calmly i
dont suppose youre glad t see me

  no im not kin

  groody gazed at redfield curiously
the serene little horseman who had
fairly radiated warmth and geniality now
seemed to have chilled that round
boyish face showed lines as the mouth
thinned and the jaw came forward and
the brown eyes were not glowing and
twinkling but turbulent

  heard from mary beaseley asked

  his eyes turned slowly toward groody
under their drooping lids

  this is lieutenant groody redfield
told him hes bought a share in prince
regent

  groody realizing that redfield had a
purpose in this announcement said
nothing

  yeah beaseley said in his deep bass
the prince must be lookin good then
eh

  he leaned against the fence as groody
thought swiftly

  redfield made a mistake there if he
wants to keep the horses condition a
secret that is-

  hell no redfield said casually we
dont even know yet ourselves slim
evans and i were broke so groody put


thomson burtis

up some money make it up in the stud
anyway

  groodys mouth drooped sardonically
redfield was an artistic liar at that

  if wed figure the prince to win the
special wed have hung on without selling
a share the ex-jockey continued

  beaseley whittled a stick with slow
heavy motions

  you say you heard from mary he
said

  uh-huh she said you were in tough
luck

  i am buddy you sure put me on
the chutes that time in louisville not
that i blame you i done wrong

  what do you want from me kin a
loan

  no i aint broke i got a few hun-
dred left-and nothin else id like a
chance to bet what i got where itd do the
most good buddy there aint nothin
in that race that kin beat the prince if
hes right and hell be big odds you
know i know the hoss about as well as
you do on account o all them days when
you was breakin him in

  i see buddy said well kin ill
tell you dont get me wrong but ive
got no use for you and you know it im
no angel and i dont say that there
arent a lot of thieves and crooked
gamblers in this world that i couldnt
like and maybe they are better men than
i am but ill be damned if id spit on a
man that would stick a sponge up a
horses nose and let the poor brute be
whipped around a racetrack with his
breath cut off like you did if he was
afire

beaseleys heavy lids raised
slowly like curtains his
snake eyes reflected no emo-
tion but as they rested on
buddys taut face groody somehow felt
chill

 however buddy went on on
account of mary ill tell you what ill

  that aint it exactly beaseley mum-
bled his head bent over his whittling
suddenly he looked up friend o
yours he enquired

  delaney was rejoining the party in a
tentative questioning way the burly
flyer approached like an uncertain dog
wagging his tail in the hope that he was
welcome

  this is mr delaney groody told
him its all right

  thought it might not be a private
party any more delaney grinned

  its like this buddy beaseley went

  it was redfields voice a peculiar
tremor in it that suddenly made groodys
spine tingle slowly the trainers big head
raised and those basilisk eyes were staring
into buddys

  pretty smart kin pretty smart

fied to let me bet for you know why you
want to hang around you wouldnt bet
a dime on the prince if you think hell

of your own
handicaps



  so far as groody could see beaseley
had not even winked his stare was
almost hypnotic buddy somehow was
like a nervous dove in front of a snake

  redfields sure scared of him groody
was thinking there must have been
some dirty pool played in the past
furthermore redfield rushed on
youd rather see me lose this race than
win money for yourself

  his words fairly crackled

  dont try to kid me kin beaseley
ive known you too long and too well
youve hated me ever since i wouldnt
fall for your crooked stuff when i was
a jockey remember your tortured bat-
tery horses remember your crooked
jockey coming up the stretch beating
prince regent and little two spot with
his whip remember the prince stag-
gering around the track with a sponge up
his nose and you expect me to kiss you
and let you hang around my horse
groodys eyes were so narrow they were
mere slits in his face he found himself
leaning tautly forward dead cigar in his
fingers redfields placid shell had cracked
wide open and there was abysmal hatred
and hot contempt in every line of his
face and every word that he spoke

  beaseleys pose leaning against the
fence did not change his eyes never
left redfields unwinking and cold they
merely stared

  but as redfield concluded they did
change it seemed to groody that blood
fairly rushed into them they seemed to
roll momentarily like those of a mad-
dened horse

  beaseley made one swift motion he
threw the stick he had been whittling to
the ground his knife unheeded went
with it for just a second the harsh
faced horseman was the epitome of fury

  then as quickly as the storm had
risen it seemed to calm his lids dropped
over his eyes like a frogs he bent to
pick up his knife

  all right if thats the way you feel
he said slowly

i furthermore youre not to come
within a mile of prince regent under-

stand and no other stranger will
either buddy warned him he had
better hold of himself now im moving
into the track tomorrow kin ill be
living at ma fosters you know the
address and the phone number my offer
still stands you can shoot your four
hundred on prince regent and youll
know all i know about the horse but if
you come anywhere near him ill chase
you out with a horsewhip

chapter iv

thats what i call working under
a handicap

they watched the horseman wander
down the track no one said a
word redfield breathing hard
was trying to calm himself finally de-
laney said-

  i dont know what it was all about
but its plain you and him aint brothers
not exactly grinned groody well
you called his hand redfield and im
damned if i dont believe you had the boy
right your offer of giving him full
information was all a man could ask and
that other stuff didnt hold water for me
sure i had him right buddy nodded
dont ever forget three items with kin
hes a natural born confidence man for
one thing hed rather make a crooked
smart dollar than a straight one second
thing is that im sure now hes got some
scheme to make more dough than he could
betting on the prince third is that for
ten years hes hated me-and hed pay
money to get even for all ive done to
him if he can combine all three-what
could be sweeter

  practically nothing admitted
groody you and i apparently are in
the same fix eh buddy

  youre sure a persecuted pair de-
laney chuckled

  it was infectious being a high pitched
giggle that issued from his stalwart body
like a mouses squeak from a lion

  what do you mean redfield en-
quired


thomson burtis

  ill tell you later say how about
getting a look at this horse

  sure come along delaney

  say old top not that i want to be
curious groody said as he stalked along
but isnt there any control over ken-
tucky racing the way you bandy
around crooked races and figure beaseley
can get away with anything-

  sure there is redfield returned
promptly a damn sight better control
than in new york or maryland or the
winter tracks either but all they can
do is weed out crooks as fast as they find
em and its tough there are too many
ways to pull a horse that cant be found
out horsesll run just for the exercise
when theyre not ready and if one horse
and jock deliberately bump another and
knock him out of winning all they can do
is disqualify and maybe suspend the jock
and the horse-and that dont get the
race for the bumped horse if he came in
third does it

  its a lot better than it used to be
but its foolish to say that a smart bunch
cant get away with a crooked race or
two in spite of all the veterinaries
stewards patrol judges and starters in the
world

  they were approaching the bams
which impelled groody to ask-

  why have you stayed out here with
him so long

  better for him for one thing werent
sure he was right for another in the
third place keeps everybody from know-
ing just what condition hes in

  thereby knocking down the odds
when he runs eh

  sure if slim and i spent twenty
thousand bucks in a year and work and
labor over the horse night and day we
got a right to cash in a little on our invest-
ment havent we

  ill say piped delaney say
george youre gonna let me in on this
aint you

sure when and if ripe groody told
him hell you know most of it now
he laughed at himself inwardly de-
laney had certainly succeeded in casually

becoming a party to a number of personal
problems and activities of one george
groody

   ill go in and get him redfield said
as they walked down the wide space
between two rows of barns royal equine
heads protruded from the open top doors
of many of the box stalls

  brood mares studs some two year
olds and horses needing a little vacation
and fixing up buddy explained stay
here and dont come very close

  he walked toward a stall the top door
of which swung open as he approached
he started talking low and soothingly

  when he had practically reached the
door a regal black head appeared and
prince regent whinnied his pleasure a
moment later buddy was leading him out
into the flooding autumn sunshine

   the tall flyer stood motionless one leg
partially bent he did not speak nor
draw in his breath as delaney did but
something seemed to turn over inside
him and he felt that he was doomed
financially from that moment

  neck arched over as the short redfield
held him close under his lower jaw prince
regent pranced forth as black as a
cloudy midnight and as sleek as condition
and care could make him he was as royal
as his name

  delaney moved

  good lord what a horse he ex-
ploded

prince regents head
snapped up almost swinging
redfield from his feet the
thoroughbred half reared his
great black eyes rolling slightly as he
snorted his fear and mistrust of the
strangers

  it was one of those momentary visions
which curiously enough are destined
never to be forgotten in that high flung
head and tense black body gleaming in
the sunshine there was as beautiful a
picture as groody had ever seen some-
thing in the majestic black held a sirens
line and to own even a share of that horse
meant much to him then
handicaps



  for a second he could scarcely fathom
his feeling in just an instant the horse
became a combination of ail things desir-
able now he could understand the feel-
ings of buddy and slim what men
thought of their home their dog their
favorite car and prize rifle plus something
deeper and more personal were the emo-
tions he felt as his eyes caressed the
perfect thoroughbred dancing before him

  well ill be damned he remarked
trying to laugh himself out of it down
in texas and out through the west
theyve got a thousand yarns about old-
timers going cuckoo chasing wonderful
wild stallions that theyve got a worse
yen to own than they ever got over a
woman i used to sit and laugh at the
stories about the pacing white stallion
but damned if i dont understand them
now

  the prince was restless but buddy had
been crooning softly to him the horse-
man smiled

 wonder why we valued him at a
hundred and fifty thousand he inquired
and then didnt sell him

  hell no

  and wait till you see him run he-

  tearing around the corner of the barns
yelping ecstatically came the most dis-
reputable dog groody had ever seen the
prince whinnied

  this is hooch his stable companion
grinned buddy hooch and two spot-
theyre the princes sidekicks everybody
else but me hes scared of

  the flop eared scraggly tailed non-
descript pup made a flying leap at prince
regents nose the stallion belted him
playfully and knocked him sprawling
hooch got up tongue out and they
grinned at each other

  groody knew something about horses
now that the first shock of the princes
appearance was over he could look him
over without being affected too much by
an equine personality

  long barreled trim legged mighty
chested he was all that a horse should be
plus sturdy haunches which seemed formed
for the special purpose of hurling that

body through the air in bounds a bit
longer than any other horse could cover

  hes just a shade high in flesh red-
field told him but if he trains soundly
this week has a race under his belt on
wednesday he ought to go to the post
saturday in the pink

  in which case groody said hell
be a cinch to win you think

  i do redfield replied unhesitatingly
listen groody tomorrow morning early
were going to run him a mile over a dirt
road a little ways from here its a
straightaway and we can get a line on his
speed why dont you come over to-
morrow morning at dawn and watch him
work if he does that mile the way two
spot will handle him in  or under and
doesnt pull up lame itll mean some-
thing

  ok groody nodded now let me
see if ive got this straight we can buy
a third share in prince regent for thirty-
three thousand dollars

  uh-huh

  that share goes for everything
groody went on that is i get one
third of the purse if he wins and one
third of the winnings on a thirty-three
thousand dollar bet which the stable will
make with my money

  exactly have you got that much
money groody

  no groody told him we have
about ten thousand in the bank to handle
the circus with but we send most of the
heavy dough that weve been making
down to texas to keep an oil proposition
that were in on going without borrowing
money we could get twenty thousand
or so from texas for a few days but this
gamble would be an awfully big one for
us if we lost it wed have to borrow
money at a terrifically high rate of inter-
est or else sell out a share in what we
think is a sure thing for much less than
its worth

  youre in about the same situation
redfield smiled as slim and i are on the
horse

just about groody admitted well
as far as im concerned if prince regents


thomson burtis

in good shape saturday i believe id take
a chance of course ill have to talk it
over with the other boys its their
money as much as mine ill see them
about it tonight and ill see you in the
morning eh

  right said redfield

  gosh delaney broke in talk about
shooting at the moon

  sounds like it doesnt it groody
remarked but if it should go through
dont forget that i wouldnt have to be
climbing around airplanes any more
you were going to tell me something
redfield reminded him something
about being persecuted

  oh yes groody replied were
having a little tough luck of our own

  he went on to describe briefly the
menace which was hanging over the
groody flyers redfield listened without
a word his round face very serious and
his level eyes never leaving groodys for
a moment when the lanky flyer had
finished the little horseman drew in his
breath

  thats what i call working under a
handicap he said slowly of course
you can take every precaution to guard
your equipment from now on-

  yes groody interrupted but its a
hell of a feeling to wonder whats going to
happen to you at any given moment in
fact its such a hell of a feeling that the
more i think of shooting a wad on prince
regent the more it appeals to me ill be
here in the morning and dont be sur-
prised if the deal is on

chapter iv

joe painterfield

it had not been light more than
fifteen minutes the next morning when
groody and redfield were standing
beside a narrow soft dirt road which ran
past the boundary fence of the stock farm
it was as straight as an arrow and three
quarters of a mile away prince regent
with two spot on his back was plainly
visible the rider was cantering his horse

down toward the starting line of the
measured mile the road cut through a
wooded area and redfield pointed out
dont forget that this clay will make
it at least four or five seconds slower to
the mile than a regular track two spot
is going to let him out and if he does it in
 under wraps and pulls up sound
itll mean plenty

  well groody remarked this little
gallops quite a gamble in itself then
now that the boys have made up their
minds to shoot the wad on your say-so
im damned if im not all worried for the
colt myself

  redfield glanced down the road and put
his field glasses to his eyes

  theyre about there he said is
your stop watch ready

  all set returned groody just give
me the word

  they were entirely alone redfield had
forbidden any of the farm laborers to
come anywhere near he did not want
any news of prince regents racing condi-
tion to reach the outside world he held
the field glasses to his eyes steadily
focused on a groom who held a white
handkerchief in his hand at the starting
point prince regent was cavorting
about fairly crying to run

  hes got the handkerchief in the air
buddy said get ready-hes off

  both men clicked their stop watches
that second groody strained his eyes
toward the small moving speck which was
hurtling down the road toward him as
it grew larger redfield the glasses to his
eyes started talking evenly

  hes running like a dream he said
his voice curiously vibrant his stride
is just as free as it ever was as far as i can
see hes not favoring that leg at all
two spots holding him in too

  looks good does he groody asked
him

  as good as he ever did so help me
look at him come hes running like a
house afire good lord

  what happened barked groody
fell off didnt he

  a quarter of a mile down the track the
handicaps



figure of the jockey leaning close over his
horses neck had suddenly disappeared
as groody strained his eyes to see he
thought that the jockeys body had again
become visible

  no he didnt fall off buddy told
him tensely but he came damn near
it looked as though he was knocked
right off the horses back threw the
prince off his stride too

  they were silent for a few seconds as
the great black thundered toward the
finishing line redfield had the glasses
trained on two spot-it seemed that he
had forgotten about the horse two
hundred yards from the finishing line an
oath dropped from his lips

  two spots shirt is covered with
blood he exclaimed and suddenly his
boyish face was haggard

  hells bells groody cried what-
as sure as god made little apples
redfield interrupted they were shot at
from those woods

  the next second the stallion rushed
past the finishing line the grave faced
little darkey on his back tried to pull him
up but it was plain that there was little
strength in those powerful arms and
shoulders of his the left side of his blue
shirt was wet with blood

  if thats what happened groody
said slowly ill chase whoever did it with
the plane

  both men were running at top speed
after prince regent jackson finally suc-
ceeded in bringing him to a halt but
before they had reached him the boy had
almost fallen off the horses back

  what happened redfield gasped
breathing hard

  dont know suh stammered the
little jockey but i think i was shot
groody was removing the blouse in
a moment what had happened was plain
to them a bullet had plowed its way
across two spots right shoulder making
a deep flesh wound

  for just an instant his eyes and red-
fields met it was redfield who spoke
first and his words were very slow

  there was somebody out in those

woods and i dont know who they were
after but it was probably the horse he
said its somebody that doesnt want
prince regent to run and they tried to
kill him

  kin beaseley

  ten to one its him or one of his men
the little horsemans eyes were full of
the same demoniacal rage which groody
had seen in him the day before

  well that means that i get into
action groody said swiftly ill get
into the air right now and if theres any-
thing stirring in this vicinity ill follow
it you get the police under way and tell
them to follow my plane when they get
here i can stay in the air for three hours
on the gas ive got if i find anything and
they can bet their bottom dollar that
therell be something to chase underneath
my plane

  he ran toward the fence with long
strides that ate up the distance vaulted
it and a minute later was starting the
engine redfield had remained behind to
cool off the stallion

groody warmed up the eight
cylinder wright briefly

  theres no wild rush at
that he soliloquized who-
ever it was cant get far from here before
i get into the air

  suddenly he remembered his stop
watch he had clicked it automatically
when prince regent had crossed the line
he took it out of his pocket and stared at
the figures

   he reflected and the horse was
thrown off his stride had a wounded
jockey and was running on that road
he is a horse

  he put away the watch and read the
instrument board quickly oil pressure
air pressure temperature the charging
rate of the battery-all were satisfactory
he shoved at the throttle and sent the
sturdy plane flashing across the level
infield he circled the field but once
climbing as steeply as the motor would
allow flying automatically his mind
was centered on two things one was the


thomson burtis

picture of prince regent eating up the
distance with gigantic strides as he bore
down upon the finishing line the feeling
which he had had the day before when he
had first seen the black stallion had been
deepened and strengthened by the sight
of the horse in action the thought of
some thug in the woods seeking to
destroy that beautiful animal was for the
moment almost as revolting as the
attempted murder of a human being
would have been it was a tight lipped
hard eyed pilot who sent his ship skim-
ming over the trees in search of its prey

  groody had his head over the side of
the cockpit searching the ground with his
eyes when he got over the section of
woods alongside the spot where two spot
had reeled from the saddle he brought the
hawk down until its under carriage was
almost sweeping the trees the bullet
had come from two spots left and the
woods extended for about five hundred
yards from the road at the edge of the
trees there was another road which led
back into the mountains

  ten to one he had an automobile
planted here groody thought to himself
he isnt in those woods i think and he
couldnt have figured on an airplane chase 

  he sent his plane higher to get a view
of as much of the road as possible it
curved around the foothills and as he
reached a thousand feet he could see that
it wove its tortuous way straight back
into the mountains groody could not
decide whether the chances were that the
fugitive would have made for the moun-
tains or for town there was no traffic at
this early hour for him to lose himself in
until he reached the outlying districts of
covington

  depends on who he is i suppose
groody reflected if hes a mountaineer
hired for the job hed make back for the
mountains if hes some racetrack crook
probably for the city

  the altimeter read twenty-five hundred
feet when a section of the road which
curved around the sides of a sizable hill
came into view for the first time it was
at least ten miles away and an automo-

bile crawling around the edge of the
mountain like a bug was raising clouds
of dust behind it

  ten to one thats the bird im after
groody thought exultantly and opened
the wright wide

  he sent the ship into a power dive and
held it there until the air speed meter
needle quivered wildly at two hundred
and twenty-five miles an hour he was
above the car in less than five minutes

  he spiraled down above it with the
motor half throttled his eyes left the
car for a moment to search the ground for
a possible emergency landing field not
even at a moment like this could he keep
his mind from the possibility of the
motors going wrong he felt a curious
tingle which was caused largely he real-
ized by fear of what might lie before him
two months ago he would have looked
forward to the emergency ahead with a
sort of fierce enjoyment he hated him-
self for the foreboding within him and he
put his plane into a steeper dive as though
to prove to himself that he was not afraid
every nerve was jumping as he realized
that in addition to any peril which might
lurk in the car below him there was not a
possible landing place within five miles
should the motor fail it would mean send-
ing his ship hurtling into the trees at sixty
miles an hour

  he tried to forget these things as he
concentrated his attention on the auto-
mobile it was now only four hundred
feet below him and he could see that it
was a battered ford it had but one
occupant the driver and the man did not
seem to be paying any attention to the
ship above him

  hes making that lizzy do all she can
do groody thought if hes my meat
the farther back into the mountains he
gets the better from his point of view

the flyer circled widely
back of the car getting so low
that his right wing tip was
almost brushing the trees on
the slope with motor full on he sent the
plane darting along above the road as
handicaps



he overtook the car he tried to discern a
gun of some kind in it the unknown
marksman would have used a rifle he had
decided-a revolver would have necessi-
tated his being too close to the road

  the driver glanced up at him as he
swept by and waved his hand

  if thats the boy im after hes a
nervy cuss groody reflected

  he banked his plane steeply and a
moment later was sweeping back toward
the car the ship was not more than
fifteen feet high and groody angled
slightly to the right to get an unimpeded
view of the vehicle suddenly his eyes
became narrower behind their goggles
and he felt himself tense he could not
be sure but he had thought that he could
see through the open windshield the
barrel of a rifle leaning against the rear
seat

  it was useless he decided to attempt
to learn anything from the air that
rifle barrel might have been his imagina-
tion but he did not think so his brain
was working swiftly in an endeavor to
formulate a plan it was useless he
realized now to put any faith in the
arrival of officers before they could
possibly arrive his gas would be prac-
tically gone and he would have to fly
very high also to enable them to see him
suddenly he realized that there was but
one thing to do-and that he had been
subconsciously trying to avoid it

  trying to sneak out on the proposi-
tion he flayed himself savagely be-
cause im a jump nerved old woman

  in a second his mind was made up if
that man down there was the stranger
who had shot from the woods his capture
was of infinite importance it might mean
the difference between a fortune and
poverty groody had never loathed him-
self more than he did then when he real-
ized that possibly the whole fate of the
texas oil venture depended on the un-
covering of any plot against prince
regent

  it was an unhappy bewildered pilot
who sent his ship skimming across the
crests of the hills toward a stretch of road

which he had spotted from the air two
minutes before there was a valley about
five hundred yards wide which the road
crossed there were clearings on each
side of it and what seemed to be an
abandoned cabin it had evidently been
a small farm groodys lean face was
drawn half because of the task before
him and half because of the misery
within

  he crossed the valley banked around
and jammed on full top rudder as
though to assuage the self-contempt with-
in him he sideslipped down the wooded
slope with such speed as almost to blow
his goggles from his eyes he brought
the ship level its nose pointed up the
road in the direction from which the car
was coming there was barely room
between the crumbling fences on each side
of it to allow clearance for the wings but
he landed safely on the rutted dirt road
it seemed that now that the die was cast
he was momentarily the groody of old
he forgot his premonitions of disaster as
his mind worked swiftly on a plan of
campaign

  he taxied the ship to the point where
the level valley merged with a hill the
hillside was thickly wooded he cursed
the fact that he was not carrying a gun
it left but one thing for him to do

  he cut off the ignition leaped out of
the plane and in a moment was hidden in
the thick undergrowth alongside the road
at a point about fifteen feet up the hill
from the ship

  scarcely a moment had passed before
he heard the throbbing engine of the
laboring ford it clattered over the crest
of the hill and he heard the brakes squeal
as the surprised driver applied them
groody was on one knee in the bushes
as the ford coasted slowly down the
slope he saw the driver as it came to a
stop almost opposite him the man
reached over into the back seat and
picked up a rifle his eyes finally left the
airplane and swept the valley quickly as
he climbed out of the car rifle in hand

  for a moment the lanky flyer studied
the stranger who he was now sure was


thomson burtis

his prey he was greatly surprised at
what he saw

  the alert driver who was standing
beside the car was no crude mountaineer
that was certain he was dressed neatly
even fashionably in riding breeches and
boots a trim coat and a soft white shirt
his necktie was vivid and the panama hat
which he wore looked like an expensive
one

  a minute which was an eternity for
groody passed he was sure that he was
invisible to the stranger for he felt that
if he was visible by any chance the
episode would end before it started-as
far as he was concerned if the man
waited much longer he would be certain
of an ambush it had been groodys
hope that he would start for the plane
before having a chance to think

the plane blocked the road
and there was no way in which
a car could be driven around it
suddenly the strangers eyes
focused on the thicket which screened
groody it was the first time the flyer
had had a good look at his opponents
face

  it was young and hard although the
regular features were well cut perhaps
it was the eyes which made his whole
countenance look as though it had been
chiseled from gray rock they were cold
and bright and blue set a little too closely
together

  for a few seconds groody thought that
he had been discovered then as though
the man had comprehended the situation
he turned toward the car and started to
climb back into it there could be but
one reason for this-he was going to turn
around and try to flee the scene

  that instant groody made his move
it was but fifteen feet from him to the
car

  the bushes crackled as he launched his
towering form toward the car the
stranger whirled like a flash but before he
could raise the rifle groody had his right
hand on the barrel and his left fist had
crashed against the mans jaw he stag-

gered back against the car and in a second
groody had wrested the rifle from him
easily

  sorry old man the flyer said sar-
donically and i might be wrong

  the mans hat had fallen off revealing
curly blond hair which added to the
youthfulness of his appearance groody
had the rifle in his hands loosely covering
his opponent for a moment the two
men studied each other the strangers
blue eyes were ablaze and his thin mouth
was twisted in a contemptuous sneer

  i know damn well youre wrong he
said coolly he had a strong southern
accent now big boy just tell me what
the hell you mean by all this stuff
before i tell you that groody coun-
tered you might tell me what you mean
by taking a pot shot at a racehorse and
a jockey a few minutes ago

  whatre you talkin about de-
manded the stranger i dare you to
throw away that gun and give me just
one crack at you

  groodys mouth drooped quizzically
the man was three or four inches shorter
than he and slender as well

  feeling a little sore are you groody
inquired well if im wrong i dont
blame you where were you going what
are you doing with this rifle in your car
and-

  none of yore damn business
well groody agreed mockingly
maybe it isnt lets take a look at this
baby

  he inspected the rifle quickly one
cartridge had been fired

  looks pretty bad for you young
fellow groody informed him in fact
i dont think the law would consider me
a damn fool if i carried you back to
covington and let them find out what
makes you tick a horse is shot at
theres nobody in the woods when we
get there theres just one car in sight and
its driven by a man whos got a rifle which
has shot one cartridge very recently got
anything to say

  he studied the mans face with mount-
ing interest as he waited for the reply
handicaps



there were lines there which expressed
experience and its good looks were of the
sort which cannot camouflage the hard-
ness beneath the young fellows face
was like a mask from which the eyes of a
cunning merciless soul looked forth
there was not a trace of warmth or
humaneness discernible in his makeup

  i dont even know what youre talking
about he said finally whats all this
business of shooting a horse and the rest
of it

  groody told him briefly

  and so he finished youre going
back with me now theres just one
chance for you to help yourself young
fellow if you come clean with me and
tell me who you work for and what the
idea behind all this is we might come to
terms who are you 

  wouldnt you like to know sneered
the stranger he was apparently un-
afraid

  thats the reason i asked you
groody told him affably how much did
you get from kin beaseley for this little
job

for a moment the mans eyes
blazed into groodys with hate
and contempt in them and
groody was aware of a feeling
of admiration at the indomitable quality
which he sensed in his captive

  youll have to watch him as long as
theres a kick left in him he thought to
himself

  suddenly a remarkable change came
over the strangers face that thin
mouth widened in a smile which exposed
even white teeth and he threw up his
hand in a gesture of half humorous resig-
nation as he spoke groody thought he
could detect a trace of mountain dialect
in his words there was a suspicion of
hyar when he said here and the
flyer thought to himself-

  ill bet he sprang from these moun-
tains at that

  i guess youve got me the man said
smilingly theres no use of joe painter-
fields taking a rap for the boys higher up

if he can get out of it maybe we can
make a trade

  thats a sensible way to talk groody
approved but get this straight the
most ill do for you is to see to it that all
of us who would have reason to appear
against you will pull our punches in
court the more you tell us thats
straight the easier youre going to get off
dont kid yourself into thinking that
theres any chance of your bounding off
in that aged flivver of yours

  painterfield was almost jaunty it was
as though the affair were purely an annoy-
ing incident as he said lightly

  that would be too good a break to be
true i thought maybe i could get away
with it

  well groody reminded him being
that you cant well get started its kin
beaseley of course but what im crazy
to know before i load you in that airplane
and give you a free ride is whats behind
it does he just hate redfield that much
or has he got some idea of winning the
special saturday

  youre off on the wrong foot pardner
painterfield said gaily

  his neatly trimmed blond hair was
tossing in the breeze and when he smiled
he looked more like an attractive young
collegian than what he was his words
were marked with the argot of the sport-
ing world-the track particularly

  yes returned groody

  a couple of yesses nodded painter-
field i dont know who this kin bease-
ley is that you talk about unless you
mean the bozo that was ruled off the
track a year or two ago but he wouldnt
know me from adam

  you dont say well who do you
work for

  youll be surprised painterfield told
him but dont think that im going to
shoot off my mouth up here in the tall
timber with you im going to get credit
for what ive got in the dope sheet right
at headquarters you could doublecross
me too easy you know i could give you
the works up here and then when i got
to the jail house find out that you were


thomson burtis

going to put me over the road for the
limit regardless i get my promises from
the bulls and the district attorney before
i wiggle the jaw see and what ive got
to tell em is going to make the past mem-
bers of the kentucky jockey club turn
over in their graves and grunt

  you interest me strangely groody
told him his mouth widening in a lopsided
grin i can hardly wait so i guess ill
just tie up your hands and load you aboard
the ship something big in the wind eh
you dont think id be pulling a racket
like this for chicken feed do you
painterfield inquired all right tie
em up

groody watching painter-
field narrowly went over to the
ship and got a length of rope
from the tool kit then he
directed his captive to stand at one side of
the fuselage and rest his wrists upon it
groody from the other side bound them
firmly while painterfield mocked him with
light hearted badinage

  youre not exactly downhearted
groody remarked

  hell no grinned painterfield
theres going to be many a backer for me
before this race is over say pardner
theres men that would hate to have me
talk who could own a stable of judges if
they wanted to

  think you may get off without doing
any talking eh groody suggested
well i dont wish you any more hard
luck than you deserve because thats
plenty but if you do get away with this
youll have to go some give me a hand
and well pick up the tail here and turn
her around for the takeoff you can lift
even if your hands are tied

  oh i aint figuring on getting off
altogether painterfield admitted but

i aint figuring on having it socked to me
either

  the two men picked up the tail of the
ship and carried it around until the plane
was pointing down the valley

  im going to put you in the front seat
groody told the racetrack man so that
i can keep an eye on you having had
my own hands tied behind my back at
various times i know how it feels so i
gave you a break the first false move you
make though youre going to have your
head caressed with a monkey wrench so
dont try any

  he helped painterfield into the front
cockpit and then started the motor it
idled along gently while groody stood
watching the instrument board the ship
had controls in each seat but there was
no instrument board in the rear

  by the way painterfield shouted in
his ear youd better get that ford out
of the road drive it to one side will you 
i dont want any one to run into it before
i get a chance to send for it

  sure groody returned and walked
toward the ford it had no self-starter
and the cranking shaft was within five
feet of the tail of the plane groody tried
repeatedly to start it but the motor
would not catch

  im going to push this damn thing
he decided instead of working myself to
death on this crank

  just as he put his weight against the
radiator the gentle clatter of the idling
airplane motor rose to a frenzied roar in
a split second the startled groody had
whirled around

  painterfields elbow must have hit the
throttle he thought then- by
harry he can fly he saw the tail of
the ship go up and realized that painter-
field was pushing the stick forward

  the plane was under way

 cfhe camp-fire

                 a free-to-all meeting
                 place for readers
                 writers and adventurers

anyway he knew our lingo

from all parts of the country re-
sponses such as this keep coming
every single one seems to state the same
fact-that his royal highness was a
regular chap one who made friends and
admirers wherever he journeyed

  you had just orter be ashamed of yourself ruinin
that fellers pertater crop down aripeka way
which means that ive just read the february th
camp-fire and if you can send me the original of that
frenzied letter and if it dont bear the ear-marks
of one of your clever editorial cubs-why the vol-
steads are on me thats all either that or you
ought to proposition mr e a oneal to correspond
with you reglar

  however what i really started to tell you was that
i can possibly add a bit of further corroboration to
edgar youngs theory that his old tramping pal was
albert of belgium might easily have been assum-
ing of course that the belgic archives dont alibi
albert too convincingly

  a bit after the war you may remember albert
and the queen and the prince his son toured amer-
ica including the far-famed yosemite valley near
which i happen to have a country home what i
saw happened on the royal partys trip out from
yosemite and if you dont mind the digression
something that happened before they left is a good

joke on our west where men are men when they
dont get mixed up at birth

  a couple of professional yosemite guides took the
prince in tow when he insisted on climbing around
glacier point which happens to be about three
thousand upright feet above the floor of yosemite 
it was off season and off the trails and it all wasnt
done but seeing that the imperious young gentleman
insisted on the jaunt these picked guides were sent
with him for protection i dont know but there are
earmarks in the incident pointing to a certain
amount of familiarity on the part of the young gen-
tlemen with alpine climbing matterhorn stuff
anyhow all unconsciously he got himself in a hor-
rible pickle on a cliff to wit the two guides
scrambling after the prince got themselves wedged
somewhere between the blue vault and the nether
eternity and the young prince was obliged to yank
them up to save their lives such a bore what

  albert was of course a hero acclaimed everywhere
by the population of his latest ally america
naturally he had to step out on the observation
platform at important places receive the plaudits of
the inhabitants and bend his tall form in a courteous
bow

  merced was the junction city where the little
yosemite railroad joins the southern pacific
californias main iron rail artery so albert had it
in his head that when merced was called out he was
to do his stuff on the back platform it was late in
the evening the queen was eh-retired and when
albert heard that word merced he walked back




adventure

it happened however to be merced falls a small
station of a saw mill some brawny dont-give-a-
damn lumberjacks and mill hands were standing
about the trains end hands in their jeans that
was all and there was the king in his immaculate
clothes looking down upon them amiably it was a
most embarrassing situation-for the lumberjacks
particularly who of course knew it was the special
of the belgian royal party finally a  pound log
roller spoke up

  by the way king did you get that sack of flour
we sent you

  sure did says the king chuckling exactly that
way and thanks a lot

ghost ship

no one really knows the fate of the
old lyderhorn used by bill adams in
his story of this issue mr adams has
given us his own dramatic interpretation
and we thought it an inspiring tribute to
the heroic breed of men who officered the
old windjammers

  glad you liked the last of the horns i dont
know just what did happen to the old lyderhorn
she was posted missing in  and had been bound
east round the horn for some european port one
of her old apprentices has written me a time or
two since i first appeared in adventure with names
of the companys ship i knew the matterhorn well
and if id a dollar for every time ive stowed the
silberhoms royals id have a nice little wad of jack
lyderhorn was a big clumsy brute of  tons regis-
ter but silberkorn could whip along at better than
fifteen miles an hour i often think that if those
big later ships had been manned as the clippers were
manned with large crews and had carried all the
sail they might have carried theyd have made some
very fine passages but theyd just enough men
and usually barely enough to handle them as they
were-minus stunsls and with no fore and afters
above topmast staysails as it was ive seen them
pass the horn in  days from antwerp and ham-
burg etc suberhorn s skipper told me that only
one ship ever passed him in the sixteen years he had
her-muskoka and i steered her past many and
many a fine ship myself when i was a nipper

  i dont know for sure what that four mast barque
was that appeared in the haze while von spee was
making his last fight it was her first sign that war
was on no doubt and i can picture the excitement
aboard her

  i sailed a few days after the spanish war started
and all i ever knew of it was what we got from the
ship belvedere which we met somewhere off the
river plate she was almost too far away for signal-
ling to our question as to whether the war was
still on she replied with one word war when we
came in it was all over but the shouting we did

sight a steamer one dark squally night and she
altered her course to take a look at us we doused
our lights piled on sail and hid ourselves in a heavy
squall thinking that she might be a cruiser never
saw her again the squall sent us along at our best
clip which was very possibly more than she
could do with her engines it was always good
fun to come up on and sail by a steamer in
those days but the worst cussing ever i heard
was when wed sight some infernal kettle and signal
her asking to be reported after maybe  days at
sea without seeing anything at all in the way of a
ship and shed pompously ignore the signals of the
old windjammer some stuck-up brass buttoned
bridge ornament whod never laid hand on a brace
in his life on her bridge i suppose-bill adams

health record when you consider the conditions
under which the soldier derives his recreation this
record is one to be proud of he is greeted at every
turn by local cafes and dives few if any respectable

this record made by this company is due to their
own personal interest in the company and not due
to my efforts one of the principal features of the
company is the clubroom in this clubroom we
have one of the most complete collections of auto-
graphed photographs of prominent people in the
service it is in connection with this feature i am
writing you to assist us

  your magazine reaches places on the globe that no
other magazine reaches this is indicated by the in-
teresting letters appearing in the camp-fire and
elsewhere pictures of isolated unknown spots are
most interesting and also very rare could you
make a request of your readers that if they could
to send to the company photographs of chiefs of
tribes natives etc in distant parts of the world
with their autographs in native writing this
autograph to read to the men of co k th
u s inf with the signature we are most de-
sirous of securing foreign countries as they will mean
a lot in the collection as these photographs are all
framed individually if possible a size about  x

  i can assure you your cooperation in assisting us
in this connection will be appreciated we have
been subscribers to advrntnre for several years and

checking error

comrade jessup questions a point
made in a recent story by captain
frederick moore it seems to us that
the author defends himself and his story
competently

   a frog-pond sailor from the outer edge of the fire-
light arises questing information

captain frederick moore in the lagoon of the
secret pearls march st number page  says
prouse slanted his sextant horizontally at
the after bulkhead checking the error of the
instrument   

   please tell us what error he is checking and the
manner and method thereof

   old prouse musta been a bear for chasing loga-
rithms round the cabin to chase noon sights on a
sixty mile rim between islands with high peaks
that on lumbucanan musta been at least  feet
high and we are told of suragos high peaks so
one of the islands would have been in sight all the
way from aloft except for current and perhaps
even then

   but it was a good story at that

                              -w d jessup

follows captain moores reply

mr jessups question about how captain prowse

checked the error of his sextant in the cabin prob-
ably arises from the fact that mr jessup was misled
into the belief that it was index error the story
did not say that prowse might have been assuring
himself of an error known to exist at times or he
may have made repairs to his sextant and by marks
on the bulkhead wall made sure the instrument was
in adjustment such as homemade cross wires in the
sextant telescope or that the line of sight was para-
llel to the plane of the instrument or some other
deviation from normal in certain adjusting screws
the incident indicated in some degree the fact that
prowse was rather rough in his navigation just as
the fact that he counted seconds when he went down
the companionway after an observation gave some
insight into the type of navigator he was not all
old-school skippers do things that are good practice
some have whims some do things not heard of in
navigation schools and such things in a story per-
tain to the character and are not intended as a
treatise on navigation i did not draw prowse as a
navigator who would be using bygraves slide rule
to solve astronomical triangles with the tables of
aquino many times navigators find fault with
what a skipper does in a story forgetting the fact
that the man depicted has peculiarities or defects
which are brought out for the very purpose of mak-
ing a point and to make the skipper different from
the normal run of persons

  mr jessups objection to the fact that prowse had
to chase noon sights to find his position is probably
due to the fact that mr jessup believed the schooner
to be on a line of position joining the islands of
surago and lumbucanan with visibility of peaks
from aloft the story did not put the schooner in
such a position and in any event a sailing vessel
cannot always run down a straight course if the
wind does not serve or the chart shows shoals or
other dangers on that line joining a pair of islands
also the skipper was not certain at first that he
wanted to pick up marson and sears but was doubt-
ful about what to do besides the story shows the
vessel in a dead calm and drifting with a current
with her wake abeam and chapter x at the be-
ginning says the schooner for days had been beating
up to the island after days of calm and again
headed by winds he was far from lumbucanan
and baffled by winds didnt he swear about being
unable to get back to lumbucanan when he de-
cided to go he was not between the two islands
and could not possibly have them in sight from
aloft it would be advisable for a skipper to chase
noon sights when he does not know his position in
such waters and i should want to know course and
distance to the landfall i wanted and about the
best way to get a fix is to take noon sights even with
a sextant that might make a good rattle to scare
crows out of a cornfield prowse was not reporting
the noon position of a battle cruiser to the fleet com-
mander or he would have better instruments and be
a different type of navigator he would hardly
waste time with noon sights if he could find island
peaks from the cross-trees-frederick moorjd

sounds reasonable

here is a comrade equipped with
everything but a companion i
suspect that by april twentieth he will be
provided for in that manner as well   

  i have never taken advantage of your columns
but would like to do so at this time i wish to take
a three weeks fishing trip this july and do not
seem to be able to find any companions i have
been considering the west but the distance in com-
parison with the time is too great i have a car
and for those near me it would be a pleasure to take
week end trips near new york for the balance of
the summer i am not particular whether i camp
live at a farm house or otherwise there must be
several people near me in the same boat and perhaps
through your magazine connections can be made
which will mean an everlasting friendship per-
haps some fellows have a sister who likes the out-
doors and the ladies always break the monotony

ships

steering devices old and new deck
plan and passengers quarters of an
old-timer

  request-will you please answer the following
questions

   when were vessels first steered with a wheel
how were they steered before wheels were used

  h	can you give me a general idea of the deck ar-
rangement and the quarters for the passengers and
crew of vessels sailing between port glasgow scot-
land and the colonies of virginia north and south
carolina about the year  was the cabin full
flush deck that is did it take the whole afterdeck
from rail to rail was it the height of the cabin
above the main deck what deck houses were
there-john andebson baltimore md

  reply by captain dingle-i am sorry your letter
was unanswered for so long but i lost my vessel
in the recent hurricane in the bahamas and all my
affairs have been like the midshipmans sea-chest-
everything on top and nothing handy

  answering your queries-

  i	wheels were used to steer ships almost as soon as
the size of vessels made tiller steering too heavy for
direct man strength at no time did all vessels dis-
card the tiller the tiller is still used on small
coasters in many instances before the wheel was
devised the steering gear was simply a tiller with
tackles the relieving tackle of today is a survival of
them before the tiller a steer-oar was used

   as for deck plan and passengers quarters of the
vessels you mention they varied greatly with the
vessels size in general the passengers cabin was
in a sort of half-poop like a big trunk cabin of today
half of its height above the quarterdeck and leav-
ing a narrow alleyway between the side and the rail
quarters for servants emigrants indentured per-
sons etc were mostly in the tweendecks but some-
times in a house on deck besides this large house

there were sometimes a forward house and a galley
but often the galley was part of either one or other
of the larger houses

  in smaller ships there might be no deck house ex-
cept the galley with an open forecastle-head under
which was the forge the carpenters bench and the
bosuns stores in large vessels with full poops as
some of the finer west indiamen the passengers
quarters extended the full width of the stern and
sometimes were two decks deep but in none of
these vessels was there full headroom for a tall man
except under a skylight i think however that even
with a full poop decked from rail to rail there were
still bulwarks all around the stern and not open
rails as one sees today

horses

jphe storied mustang and others

  request-is there such a thing in the west as a
full-blooded mustang that is a full-blooded de-
scendant of the horses the spaniards brought over

  many people think that the mongrel scrubs run-
ning wild in the west at present are mustangs

  i have read articles by major general carter and
several other writers in praise of the excellent qual-
ities of the mustang his superior endurance and
even speed to the thoroughbred and other horses of
the american pioneers if the mustang was so good
why was he allowed to die out or nearly so one
writer claims the mustang disappeared from the
plains about 

  does any one attempt to propagate the breed
i should think that he is at least as deserving as the
longhorn which they are trying to save he played
a much greater part in the history of the west

is it true that the mustang was tricky and vicious

  could an indian pony run all day what is a
palomino what does the word palomino mean

  what do you consider the best breed or combi-
nation for a cow pony


ask adventure



  what do you consider the best breed for just
plain riding in hilly and plain country

  which do you prefer for riding-stallion mare or
gelding

  do you know if black gold was part mustang

  can you give me the names of any books written
on the subject of the mustang not fiction

-hamilton s hufpman buffalo n y

 reply by mr thomas w dameron-general
carter is an eminent authority on horses his and
other writings on the mustangs qualities are true in
every sense of the word but apply only to the few
developed from many worked on it was a case of
the survival of the fittest and only those of strength
and alertness survived the onslaught of their many
natural enemies again they were descendants of
noble strain some of the best spanish strains such
as those bred by the jennet family

  interbreeding soon caused throw-backs to appear
giving us the pintos etc the infusion of thorough-
bred blood by all the stockmen of the seventies and
eighties has caused them to change completely
rather than disappear i know of no genuine mus-
tangs now but it is probable that a few may be
found in the most out-of-the-way places where it
would be impossible to round them up for the soap
factories

  i have heard of no one trying to propagate the
breed but agree with you they are far more de-
serving than the longhorn think of what the
feral horse did for the american indian and the
early western settlers and stockmen

  it is true that the mustang was tricky and vicious
which traits were instincts bred in him through gen-
erations of self-preservation properly broken and
kindly handled he was as faithful as our kentucky
thoroughbreds

  yes i believe an indian pony or any good western
horse could lope all day with the few breathing
spells that would naturally come at creeks etc of
course no animal could run at highest speed all day
without stopping to catch a breath

  palomino is generally used to describe an animal
with flaxen mane and tail or generally a cream
colored horse it comes from the spanish word
palomilla pronounced pal-o-meel-lyah meaning
backbone of a horse peak of a pack saddle or a
horse of milk white color

  as a matter of personal preference i would and
have always used crossed standard bred-thorough-
bred horses for cow-horses polo ponies and just
hard plain or hilly riding my argument being that
the standard bred is bred to go a fast mile come
back in a few minutes and do three or four more
heats he has a level head and generally good
manners the thoroughbred has the life high head-
edness and light feet we like but is bred to run his
mile or fraction and wait a day or two for his next
one am i right

  i have no preference as to sex most stockmen
will ride nothing but a gelding a properly broken
stallion is just as trustworthy as a gelding i will

admit that most of my favorites have been mares
my favorite now is a sorrel mare from a standard
bred dam and thoroughbred sire i played her a
season of polo at broadmoor she is ten years and
has never been beaten an eighth to a quarter she
has won many ribbons in lightweight hunter classes
she will show in any three gaited class and will
carry any cowpuncher through his days work she
now has a fine yearling by her side could a man
ask any more from one animal

  to enter the kentucky derby a horse must be
thoroughbred and registered hence if any mustang
is in black gold it is many generations back

  as far as i know there are no books on mustangs
general carter gave a chapter to them in his book
story of the horse

sho-sho

famous but apparently found want-
ing in action

  request-in your capacity as firearms expert for
the adventure magazine will you please let me have
some information on the following matters

  	what was the sho-sho gun of which one oc-
casionally reads in leonard h nasons war stories

  	what are the general specifications of the mon-
dragon automatic rifle is it still procurable if so
from whom

  with reference to  i have read in messrs
francis bannerman  sons catalogue that the
french are experimenting with this rifle in a short
form with a view to arming their forces with it can
you inform me whether this short form is procurable
commercially-w h blyth hamilton new
zealand

  reply mr donegan wiggins-the sho-sho
referred to by comrade nason was nothing
more nor less than that french chauchat semi-
automatic rifle the light machine gun used by in-
fantry as was our lewis and yours just ask any
returned anzac what he thought of the chauchat
and youll learn why the boys swore at them

  they seem to have been the least reliable arm
used by any of the combatants of either party dur-
ing the war and ive never yet heard a good word
spoken of them by any one

  i have never heard of the mondragon being made
commercially and doubt very much if such will ever
be the case in fact i only know of one arm being
made for commercial uses today in any portable
model that being the thompson sub-machine gun
so favored of our bandits and hootch runners it
is made in  caliber taking the automatic pistol
ammunition at present but i believe can be fur-
nished also on special demand for the luger am-
munition in  and   and  mm respectively
and up to the  winchester self-loading cartridge
in power

  personally i am not taken to any degree with the
mondragon rifle and believe our own browning-
colt or your lewis to be far superior as a weapon
goes to anything yet seen


adventure

  as to the makers of the mondragon i can not say
but suspect that it is being made for the french
army if at all by the government arsenal at st
etienne france a letter to them might produce
the information as to manufacture but i dont be-
lieve they would state anything as to intent to arm
the troops with the rifle

tungsten

on the distribution marketing and
uses of this metal

  request-i am very much interested in the metal
known as tungsten and would appreciate very much
information as indicated in the following question-
naire

  is it a fact that the only tungsten produced in the
u s is mined at boulder colo

  are the mines there substantial and likely to pro-
duce in any quantities for a considerable period

  is there an active market for this metal

  what are the main uses to which this metal is
put

  is tungsten production likely to be of major im-
portance in the near future-thos j given
houston tex

  replyby mr victor shaw-your first query-is
the only tungsten producing mine at boulder colo
is answered no but the wolf tongue co at boulder
produces the only tungsten ferberite the nevada-
massachusetts outfit near mill city nevada pro-
duces tungsten from scheelite it also comes from
round valley near bishop cal the homestake co
of south dakota mines wolframite and tungsten
from wolframite comes also from tip top arizona
and from near silvermine missouri there is also
a tungsten property mining scheelite at atolia
cal the u s a formerly imported close to 
tons

  the need for this metal to toughen steel stimu-
lated mining and prospecting during the late war
there was a big slump from - lack of
war demand caused the slump and left large stocks
of tungsten ore on hand then a high protective
tariff on this metal went into effect on sept 
which stopped imports and had a stimulating effect
on internal affairs the stocks on hand were ab-
sorbed slowly mining was resumed very gradually
and in  the tungsten products co operating
the pine creek tungsten mine near bishop cal
produced an average of  tons of ore per month
with  tons per day coming out of the mine when
all was moving properly see tungsten deposits

  i was at the boulder tungsten district in

automotive

various problems of interest to the
man who drives a car

  request-i wish to ask information in regard to
cold weather starting in the first place i wish to
say that i drive a  model  cleveland  i
have had this car in various garages and electric
service stations and the starting motor is in as good
condition as it is possible to be made this car is
equipped with the bosch system of starting lighting
and ignition nevertheless it seems that this car
is hard to start in cold weather i had just had the
battery tested a few days before and it registered
fully charged i had the ignition system checked
over and in the crankcase was an oil that was
supposed to flow at ten degrees below zero i say
supposed because that is what the company
making this oil told me

   i generally use what is termed as high test gasoline
because i understand that high test vaporizes
quicker recently i have been using sinclair air-
craft are these high test gasolines or aviation
gasolines the same that aviators use i have an
alemite gasolator on the gas line does this filter
out any water which may be in the gasoline and
cause it to freeze is there any gasoline which will
vaporize in below zero temperatures

  is there any oil on the market which will remain
fluid in below zero temperatures any that will
allow the starter to turn over freely another
thing about crankcase heaters i know of the
coleman crankcase heater co which heats the oil
when the motor is started but these heaters heat
the oil after the motor is started are there any
crankcase heaters which will heat the oil before the
motor is started i mean so a motorist could step
in his car and push a button pull a lever or some-
thing of that sort and the oil in the crankcase be-
comes heated for an easy start
ask adventure



  now about the starter i have had the starter
checked over by experts and they proclaim it o k
at present i have a good u s l thirteen plate
battery in the car i understand that a thirteen
plate battery is more powerful than an eleven plate
battery i have heard that the new oakland is
equipped with a fifteen plate battery would that
be more powerful than a thirteen plate battery if
two batteries were hooked up would that make the
starter twice as powerful i hope that i have made
this letter clear and explained all that i wish to
know by the way i always throw out the clutch
before stepping on the starter in cold weather

-elmer halker rockford 

  reply by mr edmund b neil-it would appear
from the nature of your trouble relative to hard
starting of the engine in your car that basically
the trouble is due to the battery although a
thirteen plate battery has a greater capacity than
an eleven plate it is often the case that the amount
of current required by the starting motor is so large
that the voltage is reduced below that which will
properly operate the ignition system ignition sys-
tems as a rule are designed to give a firing spark at
voltages well below the nominal  volts constituting
the open circuit voltage of the battery itself but
even though this is the case cold weather so reduces
the efficiency of the battery that it sometimes is not
able to maintain a sufficiently high voltage to deliver
a spark through the ignition coil the remedy for
this condition is the use of a larger battery of fifteen
plates as you suggest or even larger if you have room
enough to install one of seventeen or more plates
i have found personally that the larger batteries not
only last much longer in service thus being worth
the difference in price but often overcome the
trouble of difficult starting

  with reference to gasoline it can be said that the
aircraft fuels vaporize much more rapidly than those
originally used in motor cars and if the aircraft
gasoline you are now using conforms to or is better
than government specifications for aviation gaso-
line it should be easier to start with this grade than
with the ordinary kinds provided that the battery
is delivering sufficient voltage to cause a spark to
jump at the plugs for obviously no matter what
type of fuel is used it is impossible to start unless
the plugs are firing fuel strainers of the type you
mention do remove water from the gasoline and if
this is permitted to accumulate in the strainer may
cause stoppage of flow if frozen however it re-
quires the presence of quite a little water to block
the flow of fuel with most gasoline strainers

  while some of the special gasolines vaporize to
some extent at low temperatures the amount of
vaporization is comparatively small at below zero
temperatures on the other hand inability to
vaporize at such low temperatures is greatly offset
by the fact that the engine compression raises the
temperature prior to the time the mixture is fired
however i would suggest that you try a mixture of
one-third ethyl ether sometimes called sulphuric

ether and two-thirds gasoline injected directly into
the cylinders through the petcocks if installed on
your engine or through a petcock mounted on the
inlet manifold if a start is not secured with this
mixture you may conclude that the plugs are not
firing for i know from personal experience that this
ether mixture can be fired at temperatures well below
zero or in fact under any low temperature con-
ditions

  with reference to oils those with low cold test
are much better than those which solidify at fairly
high temperatures in this connection you might
try using a winter grade of aviation oil although
oils of this kind are much more expensive than
ordinary ones sometimes costing more than twice
as much

  while it is possible to hook up two batteries they
should be arranged in parallel in accordance with the
following sketch

and not in series for if hooked up in series  volts
would be delivered which in turn would probably
injure the starting motor and possibly the ignition
coil particularly if  volts were permitted to flow
after the engine was warmed up and to arrange a
series circuit of this kind to eliminate such a difficulty
would result in complication and at the same time
but little would be gained the parallel mounting
although delivering no greater theoretical voltage
would permit of maintaining a higher actual voltage
since you would have the equivalent of twice the
number of plates in the battery which in turn are
responsible for establishing the minimum voltage
drop caused by the heavy discharge required when
operating the starting motor

  while crankcase heaters are of value in thinning
the oil they would not assist you unless you had
one of the electrical type which could be turned on
prior to the time the engine is started these heaters
have an electrical resistance unit which heats the
oil before the engine is started however i do not
believe such elaborate equipment is necessary if you
use a good grade of oil and install a larger battery
or two batteries as arranged in the above sketch
your method of releasing the clutch when starting
is of value since it eliminates the drag of the trans-
mission gears

  in addition to the above suggestions to use two
batteries and to try the other gasoline mixture it is
possible to install an electric choke coil in the igni-
tion system which will slightly boost the voltage at


adventure

the coil when starting the use of such a coil is
however extremely dangerous and it must be
thrown out of the circuit immediately after starting
as it will burn out the ignition coil except at ex-
tremely high engine speeds at the same time it
can be used only with a very large battery so that
until you try this and the other suggestions i would
rather not give you details about such a device as
they are not used nor ordinarily recommcndcd by
electrical engineers due to the danger of destroying
the coil unit and burning of contact points etc

fish

   ait for small-mouth bass

  request-i would like to know the different
kinds of bait to use for small-mouth bass also the
time of season each should be used we have fresh
water fishing here last season i used live minnows
but at times they are hard to get

-x y z york pa

  reply by mr john b thompson-i presume
you refer to artificial baits for small-mouth bass
since at times you have no success with live min-
nows bait casting for them with bassorenos and
kindred wooden plugs brings results most times
during the fishing season particularly if you watch
when the fish go to the pockets and shallows to feed
which in the warm weather is generally very late
in the evening or early in the morning

  spinners with pork rind and feathered flies at-
tached are also successfully used in using a fly
rod i have great luck casting the cork bodied bass
bugs and using the standard underwater bass flies
and keeping out of sight of the fish as much as pos-
sible you know small-mouth bass like to be near
the rocks moss and weeds many times they will
not strike if there is no ripple on the water let
a breeze come up and immediately they become ac-
tive i think the reason of this is that they are look-
ing for prey under those conditions and feel both
that they are invisible for some distance to their
prey and also the ospreys that often attack them

hide

h ow to cure a green one

  request-i would like any information you
could give me on the subject of the removal of the
hair of a green hide before tanning

  i have inquired at several book stores for this
information but the best they can do is to refer me
to you-b e heitzman san diego calif

  reply by mr seth bullock-clean hide of all fat
and flesh and dry with salt when thoroughly dry
soak it in clear water for a few days until soft and
pliable inspect frequently to see that it is soaking
up the water evenly using your knife to shave down
thick or hard spots the skin must be of the same

pliability all over when completely saturated and
the hard spots shaved down mix a solution of water
and slaked lime be sure the lime is slaked or it will
burn and ruin the skin as follows

  one pint slaked lime to one gallon water mix
enough to cover the skin completely when you im-
merse it

  place the hide in this solution and work it around
in it until you are sure that the lime has reached all
parts of the skin keep the hide in this solution until
the hair is very loose when the hair pulls from the
hide almost at a touch the skin should be removed
and not before then take the hide from the lime
tack it up flat with the hair side up and with your
knife or other instrument as a scraper scrape away
all the hair and the grain of the skin it should come
away with the hair and can be recognized by the
fact that the grain is slightly darker than the skin
underneath

  how is the hunting in those states

  is there an open season on wild ducks and geese

  is shark-fishing a paying proposition and what are
the best markets

  is the use of a seine permitted and practical or axe
only gillnets used

  is there any possibility of coastwise trading
meaning only legal articles--caul c haas san
francisco cal

  reply by mr hapsburg liebe-commercial
fishing is not strictly in my line but i do know a
little about it nearly all the commercial fishermen
i know are poor men those who have made good
most of them established fish-houses and had their
own outfits it is a pretty difficult game ordi-
narily

  i am not aware that there is a closed season on
red snapper this fish is taken on hook and line
hand-lines you know and usually brings a good
price to catch them one ordinarily goes far out
taking ice and stays anywhere from three to ten
days there are plenty of marketing places i e
fish-houses

  yes you would need a license for commercial
fishing but it shouldnt cost very much salted
fish there must be a market for salted mackerel
and salted mullet since they are sold at retail in
the markets as for shrimp i know only that there
are shrimping outfits working out of apalachicola
pensacola and fernandina florida

  with regard to hunting in the states you name

there is always more or less of quail with more or
less of bigger game in the farther back sections
game is not as plentiful by any means as it was
only a few years ago there has been so much
hunting open seasons are tightening up now and
hunters licenses are costing more especially for
non-residents and perhaps this will increase the
game supply somewhat

  there is an open season on wild duck dont
know about geese for the present winter inci-
dentally i have seen very few geese in the south
game laws differ not only in states but in counties
in the same state so much that it is hard to keep
track of them write the state game warden at
the capital city of any state you wish to hunt in and
ask for free pamphlet copy of game laws to be safe

  shark-fishing there was a company down at
ft myers that tried to make a success of it com-
mercially but i understand they petered out i
guess it would be a hard thing to make go

  i am told that seines are permitted in salt water
on open shores but not in passes not for stop-
netting and that they may not be used above
certain points in narrow bays and bayous the
seine is practical if it is long enough for fish that
come inshore a power-boat is necessary to lay
the spread of course

  as for coastwise trading i dont know it might
work i am enclosing a newspaper article having
to do with this perhaps you will find it of interest

done on a schooner a sea worthy vessel skipper
