 captivating girl reared with

        the expectation of luxury finds her-
   self hounded by creditors owing to her
   fathers failure to make good her am-
   bition turns toward achieving a husband
   but for some subtle reason quarry after
   quarry eludes her at length she finds
   a willing prey but scorns his inferior past
   the disentangling of this love affair
   creates an absorbing novelette
 the tin star

         by inez thompson

author of herself this queer life calla etc

the gardener had decorated the
small platform with a bank of
tubbed white chrysanthemums
wonderful in themselves but-
open to criticism as a background
when maura wayne whose song
opened the program moved up the three
steps and turned outlined blackly
against the mammoth pallid blooms
there was an instant vibrant silence as
though the school saw her for the first
time she smiled vaguely down as she
waited through the prelude then
straightened and clasped her hands be-
hind her as she took breath for her first
note

  a very black cross went down against
her name in miss riggsons notes on
deportment miss kittrick directress
of physical culture made a like mark
and miss hollaway across the hall from
them underlined the one she made
while madame laroche sitting apart in
solitary state kept her lorgnon centered
for a full half-minute on this particular
pupil

  misses riggson kittrick and holla-
way observing the lorgnon exchanged
carefully blank glances and felt embold-
ened to make concerted attack when they
were gathered for tea and conference in
madames sitting-room

  with the standard of the school in
mind miss riggson began i wish to
ask-

 you mean to ask about maura
wayne interrupted miss hollaway
unpardonably and you are about to
make the usual excuses for her but i
am exasperated to the point of asking if
we havent laid too much stress on her
good qualities may we not this once
discuss her without sentiment i would
like to know what the matter is with
maura wayne

 madame laroche said nothing but

her smile was encouraging and an un-
mistakably eager expression about the
mouths of the tea-taking teachers told
miss hollaway who was half scared at
her own unprecedented speech that her
proposal was welcome

  take her smile she added what
is there so irritating about her smile
miss kittrick put down her empty cup
with a click

  her smile expresses what her body
expresses she declared did you
notice her standing attitude and the
very school noticed her-her abandon of
body-against those flowers i have
drilled her privately on position-have
criticised her in class-

  and her voice broke in miss hol-
laway again i have come to the con-
clusion that i cannot get her to speak
with a proper inflection ever she uses
the same inexpressibly intimate caress-
ing coaxing tone to all of us and to jane
who polishes the hall floors i was
obliged to admonish her on that point
this morning and she was impudent be-
yond words she said that she could
not and would not think eternally of her
voice or her words or her manner that
she had decided that our definition of
lady was a polite evasion of liar and
that she wouldnt be proper or good be-
cause it was correct to be so but because
she wanted to be and if she wanted to
be improper and the other thing she
would be that-but that whatever she
was she would be honest and she end-
ed by informing me that we all-all of
us-made her tired f 

  i defy anyone said miss kittrick
solemnly to look at that girl without
thinking of the body under her clothes
it is a superbly healthy and graceful
body i grant but i find a sad signifi-
cance in the fact that her poses are so
instinctively - inescapably - suggestive

the tin star

in spite of her youth and innocence in
the last six months it has become notice-
able she can no more restrain her
movements than a-a panther there
is some powerful natural tendency there

i	fear-inherited no doubt-

  there was an inquiring pause they
all looked at madame laroche that
personage with her inimitable manner of
gracious condescension passed her cup
to miss riggson and by a downward
glance conveyed to miss hollaway that
she desired the footstool placed more
comfortably under her beautifully shod
feet then in her cool soft distant
voice she enlightened them as to maura
wayne

  it goes without saying that i in-
formed myself as to the antecedents of
this pupil as is my invariable custom
her father was of distinguished ances-
try-the untitled branch of the middle-
sex digbys the mother well i fancy
it was a case of infatuation and hasty
marriage sir maury digby who seems
to have had a fondness for his misguided
kinsman wrote in reply to my inquiries
assuring me of the correctness of the
information that had been given me but
making it very clear that neither he nor
any of the family would acknowledge
the relationship beyond admitting it
the girl is named for him-maura-
and he made a handsome settlement on
the father i believe both father and
mother died in the childs infancy and
she was placed here by her aunt i think
that the aunt may explain what we find
-er-difficult in our young charge i
recall her as an amazingly handsome
young woman of sufficiently good ap-
pearance but hopelessly american of
course she seemed to have a fitting ap-
preciation of what was due her nieces
superior blood and agreed to my rather
humiliating conditions very readily i
stipulated that she was to see her niece
on the christmas holidays only and that
the childs summers were to be spent in
quiet places of my choosing where the
aunt might visit her weekly if she so de-
sired i doubled my tuition fee for the
first five years it has been paid regu-
larly the standard of our school is a
costly simplicity in dress-and my extras

have never been questioned but i agree
with you that there seems an ineradica-
ble something in short i mean to try
what a change in dress and an earnest
talk will do toward subduing the unfor-
tunate tendencies we have remarked
the christmas holidays are approaching
and the change to her aunts mode of
life may serve to shock miss wayne into
an appreciation of our code if all fails

of course- she gestured daintily

and maura wayne was consigned to ob-
livion with that two-inch movement of
the aristocratic hand

  she is tall-perhaps to lengthen her
skirts would be wise agreed miss kit-
trick with the magic of sir maury dig-
bys name hampering her tongue and
a remonstrance from you madame-

  and madame inclined her slightly gray
coiffure with the marquise-of-the-old-re-
gime air that was not her least valuable
asset and when the door was shut be-
tween the clever under-teachers and her
clever self she held her slim arms up in
the air as though appealing for some
burden to be lifted from her at times
the orthodoxy and inch-wide convention-
ality of her assistants drove madame
into a gallic fury but they never knew
it

  they never knew and wouldnt have
understood if they had known the man-
ner of her straightforward talk with the
subject of their complaints maura an-
swered the summons to madames sit-
ting-room without fear and without sus-
picion she had an enormous admiration
for that delicately cold lady and an un-
quenchable belief in the kindliness of
fate that the pin-prick attacks of the as-
sistants had not even slightly disturbed
moreover she expected to be asked-as
indeed she was-into madames dress-
ing-room with the subtle exquisite
wraiths of scent in the air and the rose
shades  the lights and the delightful
cleanliness and order and restrained lux-
ury suggesting as near an approach to
intimacy as madame would ever allow
there were perhaps a half dozen girls
who were able to boast that they had
been interviewed in madames dress-
ing-room while that gentle autocrat re-
clined in a cushioned chair and took her
the tin star



chocolate and the privilege puzzled them
even while they boasted but madame
unerringly knew in what surroundings
she could accomplish certain results

  lili the swarthy fat provengal maid
who was as silent and discreet and at-
tentive as madames shadow was attend-
ing to the superlatively perfect nails as
maura tapped her confident way in past
study and sitting-room the gray light
of the sleety december afternoon wav-
ered back from the muslin and rose silk-
hung panes a merry little fire snapped on
the bright hearth the lights shimmered
soft and warm through their rose shades
and a vase of scarlet carnations added
spice to the faint scent and a high note
of gay color to the cozy room maura
made her too brief too friendly curtsey
and then beamed about the four walls
with a frank approval that would have
driven miss riggson to chill speechless-
ness madame on the contrary nodded
appreciation of the unspoken delight

  ones living-place like ones body
should have its heart she said cordially
come then into this heart of my home
and-lili put the tabouret with the
sweets over to that chair now then
we may talk you welcome the christ-
mas season that takes you to your aunt

  maura looked up in candid surprise
from the silver-papered box over which
she was bending save for an occasional
perfunctory inquiry madame had never
recognized the existence of that aunt
who even to maura seemed to belong to
a separate life

  why thank you-yes she said a
trifle uncertainly and then as her recol-
lection of her only home came to her
more warmly she smiled in the way miss
riggson found so objectionable and her
lithe body relaxed to a comfortable
slouch in the easy chair yes she said
again it is so jolly with aunt claudia
she might have been speaking to a class-
mate but madame coolly observant of
the smile and the relaxing and the man-
ner overlooked the lapse

   when you leave us finally she asked
what are you intending-to make your
home with your aunt

  the relaxed young body tensed itself
quickly and the black-pupiled hazel eyes

darkened to brown the up-curving
very red mouth straightened and a quiver
of intensity trembled the lower lip with
two such features it had been sheer prod-
igality in nature to add silver-yellow
hair with a loose wave brightening its
saxon fairness a skin as white as milk
and wonderfully regular features re-
deemed from a suggestion of heaviness
by the quickening and abbreviating of
the american mothers blood and con-
tours just where a hint of coarseness
came in it was impossible to say perhaps
because it was so deeply within but the
mouth-beautiful as it was-had never
pleased madame and there was a
trace of sharpness in her voice as she
answered the appeal of its tender un-
steadiness

  is it that you are sorry because your
future is so uncertain or sorry that
you have been so heedless as to have
given it no thought

  quick pink stained the oval face not
the scarlet of anger nor the flush of
shame but the lesser color of a transient
emotion

  i had not thought she said that i
need question as to my future there is
enough aunt claudia has told me so
we shall go abroad probably where liv-
ing is more easily managed on a small
income but i had supposed-i had in-
tended-to stay here for as long as might
be i have three more-

  madame laroche withdrew her fin-
gers from under lilis buffer as noise-
lessly as a ballooning cloud that observ-
ant attendant rose and went out

  come closer child here madame
gestured to the cushioned stool that lili
had vacated give me your hand and
look at me and search me so that you
may know i speak from my heart to you
and open yours to me child you will
not come back to us and it is you who
tell me so every look every smile of
yours for six months past has told me
so you are innocent still but no longer
ignorant vaguely you know that you
are asking questions of life though you
do not put those questions into words
what will be answered what life is to
give you neither i nor any other can tell
but what you are to pay-the easily paid


the tin star

and yet never paid price that will be
asked of you few can foresee more
clearly than i attend to me

  she put her other hand over the slim
white ones she held and briefly kindly
mercilessly she destroyed the last gauzy
veil between the questioning eyes and
t ruth

  maura wayne has reached the weep-
ing stage observed miss kittrick a few
days later with the cynicism of one
familiar with the psychology of the ma-
turing girl

  but tears are becoming to her miss
hollaway retorted cattishly else she
wouldnt indulge in them

  it was perfectly true with the dis-
secting curiosity of her age and sex
maura had studied herself in grief and
had found that her great eyes looked
like amber and jet glimmering up through
crystal pools when she cried that her
small nose was pathetic when daintily
pink at the tip and that the droop of her
scarlet lips was so pathetic that she al-
most wished to kiss and console their
mirrored appeal but when she looked
at her pleasing sorrow long enough it
seemed to dissolve and to leave her face
to face with a consciousness unknown
yet hatefully familiar mysterious yet
sickeningly real it was the self that
madame had revealed to her in such
fashion that never again could its exis-
tence be forgotten or ignored  and maura
wayne wept more or less continuously
for two weeks not because the visage of
truth was so terrible but because she
could no longer deceive herself as to what
lay under her own exquisite color and
form and seeming candor and to know
ones self is to become aware of a sleep-
less foe within the citadel who must be
endlessly circumvented because he can
never be expelled

  you have subdued miss wayne so
amazingly ventured miss riggson to
madame that one is forced to wonder
whether a change so decided can be per
manent the very fact that she never
lapses makes her perfect conduct seem a
pose she is engrossed with being plain-
tive and reproachful

  as yet said madame she has en-
countered no one so interesting to her as

she is to herself her egotism is a thing
that time will correct

  to be sure miss riggson concili-
ated she is but a child and in pay-
ment for that hypocrisy fate elected that
it should be miss riggson who encoun-
tered a distinguished feminine figure in
the dusk of the corridor outside ma-
dame s room and who genuflected to it
in the belief that the elder sister or suc-
cessfully young mother of some pupil had
come for a conference with the head un-
der pretext of chaperoning on the holiday
journey home

  can i be of service do you wish to
find madame laroche the inquiry
was in the manner of tonal simplicity and
instinctive dignity that miss riggson
strove to impart to her young ladies

  yes i-thank you so much miss
riggson-but if you would ask madame
if she will spare me a moment faltered
the unknown and miss riggson gasped
in wrath

  maura wayne

  yes miss riggson these are my
new things that madame has been super-
intending-theyve just come and i
thought shed wish to see them on me
do you think i might knock

  indignation strove with curiosity in the
woman heart of miss riggson and curi-
osity won she turned back and tapped
the knocker against its metal plate

  may i bring in maura wayne for a
moment she asked stepping inside at
madames summons the lorgnon lifted
to assist in madames brief penetrating
look and miss riggson felt that her in-
dignation her curiosity and her subter-
fuge were as apparent as though her body
were glass

  but certainly said madame with the
faintest of smiles as she closed her book
pink and prickly miss riggson stood
aside and waved the transformed girl
through the doorway with what she
hoped was a condescending gesture and
turned with avid eyes to see what arti-
fice had so deceived her critical senses

  but there was no artifice there was
but the revelation of the maura wayne
who had been extinguished under the
one-piece blue serge frock and turn-over
white collar that was the compulsory
the tin star



dress of the school miss riggson saw
all at once that the simplicity of it had
been more artificial than the modish at-
tire madame had selected diana made
mortal could be made ridiculous by com-
monsense shoes and a windsor tie and
the long lines and graceful contours that
had defied the restraint of the character-
less costume subsided in their individual
setting most decorously madames un-
erring taste was evidenced in every de-
tail one got but an impression of rich-
ness of cosily restraint of perfection in
every hidden accessory all subordinated
to the culminating point of the face under
the quaintly simple hat miss riggson
found herself against her will recalling
sir maury digby of the middlesex dig-
bys as she marked the carriage of head
and slim shoulders accented by the skilled
cut of broadcloth but her captious scru-
tiny seized on the flaw she felt rather
than saw in the flower-like face in its
setting of piquantly tilted brim and
gleaming furs the digby blood should
have tightened those scarlet lips lifted
the perfect lids a hairs breadth cooled
the too eager shine of the extraordinary
eyes and steadied the softly rounded
chin beauty-even loveliness of an un-
usual sort she acknowledged  but with an
intuition that amounted to confidence she
felt that the flaw concealed in that ex-
quisite mechanism would one day mar the
whole and she was sorry that she could
not feel sorrier for the prophecy even
while her never-appeased heart contrac-
ted with bitterness that one face should
be so dowered and another so denied

  it is very well done said madame
lowering her lorgnon her deliberate scru-
tiny finished is it not quite perfect
miss riggson

  affecting to study the ensemble she
had already noted in each detail miss
riggson had a curiously detached sense
of the contrast her own face made seen
opposite that rare loveliness her own
sallowness her spectacles her thin brown
hair and pallid mouth stung her in sepa-
rate and combined memory and she
ceased to be sorry for the flaw in maura
wayne

   it is quite perfect she agreed stiffly
of course it alters miss waynes ap-

pearance materially and its effect on the
discipline of the school-

  these things are for traveling and
are not to be worn until the day of depar-
ture for the vacation madame inter-
rupted taking up her book they are
not to be shown my dear nor discussed

  two gracious nods sent them both out
instantly miss riggson made pretense
of turning to the right but stepped back
into the corridor to watch the tall regally
moving figure going its incongruous way
to dormitory and discipline she was
puzzled at such a departure from custom
as she would have called impossible
madames restrictions in the matter of
dress extended even to the home life of
her pupils and her attitude on the psy-
chology of attire had earned for her the
respectful attention of educators neither
miss kittrick nor miss hollaway was
able to advance any satisfactory explana-
tion of her departure but then neither
of them knew mauras aunt claudia

ii

  maura was pleasantly conscious of her
heart beats as she followed her porters
red cap toward the train gate through a
jostling noisy crowd with the exciting
unwonted noise of the great clamorous
terminal in her ears and her cheeks still
tingling from the experiences of her just-
finished journey

  at the junction where she had left the
special car from the school the chaperon-
ing teacher had put her in her scat of the
pullman informed the conductor that she
was one of madames young ladies
tipped the porter to insure attention seen
to her every want provided her with an
approved novel and then left her with
polite farewells and the usual formula of
seasons wishes

  novels sparingly allowed throughout
the year were permitted by madame on
journeys as a counter-attraction to the
excitement of traveling put maura had
been awakened to the degree of self-
knowledge and expectation that makes
the most romantic fiction a pallid thing
beside the vivid actuality that any hour
may bring

instead of plunging at once between


the tin star

the alluring red covers she had swung her
chair about and looked up and down the
opposite aisle a thing expressly warned
against by the chaperoning teacher and
it had been as enlivening as watching a
spark travel along a sprinkled trail of
gunpowder men and women meeting
her eyes had stared but with a differ-
ence  the women had looked at her as
miss riggson so often looked but there
had been a young man with ardent brown
eyes and another with very bright blue
eyes and a middle-aged interesting iron-
jawed man who had hardly taken their
gaze from her for the rest of the way
one after another they made errands for-
ward in the car to speak to the conductor
or to go for a very brief stay in the smok-
ing compartment and then they would
walk back the aisle toward her very
slowly staring shamelessly and so in-
tently that her head seemed dragged
about for a fleeting answering glance
once she had dropped her book and the
two young men had leaped for it and had
struck their heads together as they bent
in spite of her flutter that had set her
school-bred nerves to tingling she had
giggled outright and they had bowed
haughtily and had kept in their seats for
fully five minutes afterward

  the middle-aged man hadnt made her
feel so fluttery but had given her a not
unpleasant sensation of fear he nar-
rowed his eyes and set his jaw most
thrillingly when he met her look just as
the most intense matinee hero would
have done had matinee heroes happened
in real life and once she had thought
that he meant to stop and speak but the
conductor had come up to ask if she
wished anything from the buffet and
then had stayed talking of his little
grandchildren and afterward had come
back to point out interesting bits of scen-
ery and the pastime of the three admir-
ers was at an end the blue-eyed young
man had crowded very close to her on
the way out of the car but the conductor
had appeared again had put her specially
in charge of a station porter and had
stopped the blue-eyed young man to ask
if he hadnt made a mistake in the bag
he had taken from the pile the train por-
ter gave out

maura found herself palpitating all at
once with a lealization of what a fear-
some thing it would have been had the
young man actually spoken to her it
was nice to be looked at in such fashion
-so pleasant that it certainly could not
be among the myriad forbidden things
that madame had rehearsed to her but
to think of speech with one of the un-
knowns was like hesitating with the key
in the lock of bluebeards forbidden
chamber it was precisely because she
did not know to what it might open that
she was afraid

  she dodged through a knot of people
and half ran through a cloud of escaping
steam from the panting engine purely
from instinct of concealment but it was
as much evasion of the new self that
threatened her as of an outer alarm

  through the mass congealed beyond
the high gates she saw a tall figure in
black noticeable even at that distance
aunt claudia always wore black and her
hats always seemed to have an upstand-
ing trig spirited effect however closely
after the mode they were maura felt a
contraction in her throat a rush of feel-
ing that swept away her past weeks un-
happiness her present sophistication and
every fluttering recollection of her first
adventure she remembered all at once
that it was christmas week that there
would be wonderful things to eat and
pretty house things to wear and some-
thing too wonderful for words at her
plate christmas morning and ignoring
her lengthened skirt and her quite
grown-up effect she began to run 
tiptoe toward the stately black figure
standing back a little from the center of
the crowd

  the trig hat turned toward her as the
people between made way and her eyes
met aunt claudias full and so near that
she saw how startling the bright pink
and white of her aunts face seemed un-
der the wide very black meshes of a
tight-drawn veil and then with  sign
of recognition the hat turned front
away to the stream of arrivals still lag-
ging through the gate

  maura felt a constriction  her throat
that was half hurt and half self-accusa-
tion somehow although she had al-
the tin star



ways meant to ask to see aunt claudia
between the holiday visits the full year
continued to pass and there was always
the oddly constrained business of getting
acquainted but not to be recognized was
new she stumbled forward

  oh aunt claudia im inside these
grown-up things and im so glad to
see you-so glad wet-eyed she flung
herself against the persian lamb coat
burying her face in the scented softness
and so missed her aunts look but her
arms were gripped by hands that hurt

  maura the tone rather than the
hold brought her head up she hadnt re-
membered such a rasp in aunt claudias
voice through the broad meshes of the
veil the handsome bright brown eyes
were staring down at her exactly as miss
kittrick had stared and the scarlet
mouth was set precisely as miss rigg-
sons colorless one used to set

  who got those things for you

  why-madame did ive grown so
tall you see dont you like them aunt
claudia the queer tightness of the
questioning mouth did not soften

  what did madame say when she got
them for you didnt she send any
message to me anything at all

  no nothing it was just that i was
so tall-and theyre only to be worn
when i travel i didnt dream youd
dislike them-

  red flushed all over the plump firm
cheeks and the tense mouth forced itself
up in a sickly smile

  oh i dont you took me by sur-
prise-and it changes you so for pitys
sake dont look as though i meant to eat
you child  give me your checks-come
along

  she turned and walked very fast to-
ward the baggage-checking window
for a quarter of a second maura stared
after her with a curious tingling sensa-
tion in her face not at all like the warm
confusion she felt when madame la-
roche corrected her she was actually
angry and it didnt seem to be anger
at aunt claudia but at an unknown
woman whose voice was disagreeable
and who hadnt been sufficiently well-
bred to greet her as one should greet a
guest with immense dignity she threw

her fur neck-piece across her shoulder
muffling her unsteady chin and walked
slowly after the brisk figure in black

  someone brushed her elbow in passing
-brushed it again so lengthily that the
contact could not have been accidental
she looked up into the face of the mid-
dle-aged interesting man who had looked
at her so closely in the pullman he
looked down so reassuringly that she
was instantly conscience-stricken that she
should have thought his touch rudely in-
tentional  and at the pleasant almost pa-
ternal smile he gave her she smiled back
shyly

  rather a crowd isnt it he com-
mented  and then casually have you
been met your people your friends
can i be of any assistance

  thank you no-my aunt is seeing to
my baggage- her voice took on in-
voluntarily the shyness that character-
ized madames young ladies so charm-
ingly in their early association with the
unknown masculine the man looked at
her again sharply and then ahead in
search of the aunt the tall black figure
faced about at that instant and saw him
it seemed to maura that a smoke-
shrouded flame streamed down on her
and she felt her wrist grasped almost
viciously by the capable black-gloved
hand

  i told you to come with me aunt
claudia snapped how did he come to
speak to you was he on the train
did he speak to you before

  speechless burning with mortification
maura dragged her apologetic eyes
around to the inoffensive middle-aged
man on her right he had disappeared
a pink-nosed worried woman with small
children beyond counting was jostling
her on that side but far ahead she saw
a tall impressive-looking figure that she
recognized walking fast

  she faced about to her aunt feeling
that odd tingling in her face again and
instinctively resorted to an imitation of
madames own cold tone of displeasure

  no he did not speak to me on the
train and he merely offered his services
now in case my people had not met me
you are hurting my wrist

  in her throat a throb of fear at her


the tin star

own daring pulsated painfully but she
fought that it should not show in her
face the meshes of aunt claudias
veil showed blackly against a turgid red
and she released the wrist she held

  im so nervous im most ready to
jump out of my skin she said vehe-
mently i got up with the worst sick
headache this morning-minnie tell
you so lets get home as soon as we
can youve got to be careful who you
let speak to you-a girl cant take any
chances nowadays keep right with
me

   and she was to stay with this woman
three weeks shocked at her disdainful
phrase maura looked sidewise at the
effective figure in black to correct her
mental revulsion and instead of correct-
ing deepened it she found herself re-
calling a phrase that leila hilford the
most worldly-wise of her class had used
in criticising a famous beauty of society

   nobody is really afraid of her leila
 had said loftily because she wont last
 in a very few years shell be the washer-
 woman type-i heard aunt say so to
 mother theres a plebeian strain in her
 and shes too much everything too big
 eyes too red mouth too much laugh and
 tears and all that and even now no
 matter what she wears one is conscious
 of her corset

   it fitted aunt claudia there was too
 much chin as she bent through the win-
 dow giving her address too much bright
 color in face and lips too unmistakable
 evidence of powder too noticeable veil
 too obviously trim figure in negligee
 one knew that those released curves
 would sag to unpleasant flaccidity
 maura looked down her own slim length
 from waist to ankle as the modish blue
 broadcloth suggested it comparison
 would not have suggested itself to her
 six months before even now it was a
 hardly comprehended result of her re-
 sentment but as she lifted her eyes
 they met the bright brown eyes turned
 on her with an expression that drove the
 last shred of complacence from her mind
 and left her very young and very much
 afraid of something she didnt under-
 stand yet on that very breath the look
 altered aunt claudias round white

 chin quivered and the bright eyes filled
 with tears she put out her black
 gloved hand

 come home-come home with your
cross old aunt dearie she said unstead-
ily and put on your little dress with the
turnover collar and be her little girl
again maura felt her throat contract

  oh youre not cross youre dear
only im a selfish horrid little beast and
i-im sorry im so grown-up aunt
claudia i want-i want to be your lit-
tle girl-more than ever at christmas

  cuddled close to the scented fur shoul-
der she lay back happily in the taxicab
and chattered with no intent to de-
ceive she told of the simple side of school
life how hateful miss hollaway was
and how leila hilford had snubbed miss
riggson in class and how they had the
spread in cora morris room after it
had been discovered and forbidden in
another girls and how perfectly stun-
ning madame had looked that morning
as she stood in the library against the
tapestry of fontainebleau and said good-
by and how lazy irma williston had
actually finished dressing after they were
in the special pullman such things
seemed to please aunt claudia and she
found herself dwelling on them avidly
because they made that terrible interview
with madame seem unreal by keeping
it unreal long enough and by keeping
her mind persistently on the silly inno-
cent things of everyday she hoped to
forget it and anyway she was sure
that madame had exaggerated the pic-
ture she drew in order to impress it
upon her mind

 plave you got minnie yes of
course you spoke of her and pom-
pon and did you have the dining-
room done over in fumed oak and dui
you ever get that black lace over apple-
green that i wanted you to have

  aunt claudias chin quivered again
even as she smiled

  so you remember those things do
you i told minnie you had forgotten
all about the things you did with us be-
cause you never spoke of them after one
or two letters maura flushed

  there were so many things happen-
ing she apologized and my letters
the tin star

ii

seemed to fill up so but i always re-
membered to send my love to minnie

  minnie her aunts black maid who
seemed always to have been with them
came suddenly to her mind as another
she hadnt meant to neglect or forget
and yet once away from aunt claudia
and all that pertained to her it was as
though she stepped into a new world
from which the other was not even re-
motely visible

  dont the girls ever ask where i live
or how or anything asked aunt clau-
dia with an almost childish intonation of
hurt maura sat away from the fur
sleeve with a wince of distaste

  oh they used to ask-but at school
its taken for granted that one is from
the right sort of place and ive been
there so long when they made sure
my underwear was hand-made that
seemed the principal thing and most of
the girls are from new york or from
the far west so they dont know much
about this city and-i told them once
that you were an invalid and couldnt
have the care of an establishment and
never saw people and anyway they
think were english leila hilford
kept at me until she found that i was
named for sir maury digby and after
that-

  her half-defiant confession trailed off
in apologetic silence but instead of
showing pique at being denied aunt
claudia nodded proudly

  well thats true enough you are
named for him and some day when
your educations finished well go to
england and look him up he was
awfully fond of your father and you
look like your father-except the eyes
she studied the girls face with new
keenness her own animated maura
felt herself stirred by an entirely new
excitement the alluring hodge-podge
that comprised her knowledge of eng-
land began to ferment in her optimistic
brain

  oh aunt claudia wouldnt it be sim-
ply great she sighed ecstatically to
see those ducky thatched-roofed cot-
tages-and the hedges blossoming-and
to live in a castle with old plate and fam-
ily servants and tea on the lawn and

titles as thick as blackberries on your

visiting-list-

aunt claudia made a queer joyous
sound swooped forward and kissed her

  will you do it maura she asked
excitedly her chin quivering again her
eyes too big and bright will you plan
for it with me and stick to it because
you could auntys handsome baby could
if shed just make up her mind to it and

ill save and get enough ahead-

  the taxi jerked and stopped they
were in front of an ornate apartment-
house with granite-pillared entrance a
silver-buttoned black boy running down
the steps to them a gleam of marble tiles
and bronze elevator grille and the tropi-
cal note of potted palms inviting through
the plate glass of the massive doors
from the girls mind slipped the last
faint homesickness for the stately school
set on its hill acres with the chaste snow
drawn to its sills the regularly grouped
trees like sentinels set about and the
evergreen hedges lying dark and straight
like a fur trimming on the white gar-
ment this gay exterior filled her fancy
with suggestions of entrancing forbidden
things to eat and forbidden things to do
and lazy happy days of holiday-making

  she ducked her cheek against the per-
sian lamb shoulder as they went up in
the sumptuous elevator

  oh-to be here she sighed ecstati-
cally youre so good to me

  youll pay it all back and more then
murmured her aunt with an affection-
ate pat she was still thinking of eng-
land maura concluded after a puzzled
second

  as they stepped off at the third floor
the door of the front apartment was
opened by a thin good-looking yellow
woman white-capped and aproned who
stood craning out and beaming

 minnie-you dear maura reached
both hands as she went forward she
saw the broad smile vanish a scared look
take its place then a sickly grin that was
a mere showing of white teeth this
time she understood and found herself
not displeased

 minnie-you too i thought youd
know me if no other did the jet eyes
darted a glance over her shoulder to the


the tin star

taller figure then traveled swiftly from
her hat-top to shoe-tips the lean face re-
laxing to its first whole-hearted grin

  well-well i certnly am taken by
sprise she patted the small hands she
held lovingly a grown-up young lady
sure enough-but jes as welcome as the
lil girl i was expectin come right
along into yo own room an lemmc ten
you miss dearie miss claudia maam
theys a-a lady waitin to see you on
important business she says

  a delicious blending of fragrance
wafted out as maura whirled around to
link her arm with aunt claudias before
they entered

  incense-the same as you used to
burn  she cried happily eyes squeezed
shut and small nose wrinkled sniffing
and the leastest smell of that awfully
expensive perfume and-and a heap of
carnations somewhere-and-oh  you
blessed old minnie youve made spice
cake and new little rolls for tea im
home im home im home

  she dropped her aunts hand pirouet-
ted dizzily across the polished iloor and
bokhara rug of the small entrance-hall
and whirled in through the portieres of
the dining-room before minnie saw her
intent and uttered a sharp remonstrance
that went unheeded or unheard

  fumed oak she shrilled and
stopped short around the high back of
the handsome chair that she had thought
unoccupied and had grasped to turn
about for inspection came a slow-mov-
ing magenta rose followed by a purple
rose a glitter of jet a fuzz of pongee-
colored hair and a globular pink mass
that she knew to be a face even as she
made startled search for the slits of eyes
the dab of nose and the odd red pucker
that was the mouth

  i-beg-a thousand pardons she
gasped staring fascinated at the curious
glimmering eyes behind those unbeliev-
able lids but i didnt know-

  maura said her aunt almost an-
grily go to your room with minnie
please

  just a minute-how ddo claudia
you dont mind my making myself at
home i hope just a minute my sweet
little lady- 

  the extraordinary caller had been
surging in her chair as she spoke and
succeeded in grinding it about on the
heavy rug till she sat half facing them
she was magnificently dressed maura
saw that even as she felt a qualm of nau-
sea at such corpulence as she had never
beheld the short bloated body was en-
cased in rich purple cloth and the skirt
hitched up by the massive knees in sit-
ting showed a wonderful embroidered
magenta silk petticoat diamonds glin-
ted in the gold-threaded chiffon about
the crease that was the creatures neck
and her shapeless stubby hands were
congested by the dozen conspicuous rings
she wore a decanter of wine was be-
fore her on the table a half-emptied
glass beside it

  now i wonder if this is the little girl
ive heard about she went on in her
indescribable voice a voice that sug-
gested a worn-out mechanism oiled to
dripping but still wheezing and skip-
ping because if it is shes the luckiest
little sweetheart-

  this is my niece my niece aunt
claudia swept forward and put her arm
about the surprised girl she is just
with me for the holidays and then goes
back to school theres some mistake
minnie take the child to her room and
make her bath ready and take off these
ridiculous grown-up things and put 
one of her school dresses now
maura-

  the strange rasp that maura had
heard for the first time an hour previous
was in her voice again and she had lost
her brilliant color unmistakably she
didnt like this caller who made free with
her wine and whose manner was so of-
fensively familiar maura made a stiff
little bow and whisked out after minnie
with no attempt at concealing her aver-
sion with the door that separated the
bedroom corridor from the hall hardly
shut between them she ejaculated her
disgust

  that dreadful sickening mountain
how dare she make herself so at home

  miss claudll sen her about her busi-
ness assured minnie evasively yo
shet yo eyes honey miss an dont open
em tell i say so
the tin star



 oh goody-what minnie say-
quick with her eyes wrinkled shut
again and her insatiable little heart flut-
tering she instantly forgot the gross
creature she had left she heard minnie
open a door-her bedroom door felt
the strong yellow hand guide her across
the threshold and face her about and
with a childish gasp of expectancy she
opened her eyes going off at once in a
rapturous tiny squeal her severe white
bud of a room had been transformed to
a splendor of deep-toned ivory and lemon
that seemed to have taken its note from
the gorgeous mass of great chrysanthe-
mums in a jar on a squat tabouret be-
tween the windows the effect was that
of cool-filtered sunshine and curiously
like the warmest light in the mass of fair
hair that minnie patted admiringly as
she removed the hat of madames selec-
tion

  its ab-so-lutely perfect breathed
the girl i used to think that madame
-at the school you know had the most
perfectly wonderful rooms anyone could
imagine but hers are not one whit love-
lier than this but how can i ever leave
it and go back to that dormitory isnt
it perfect minnie

  an electric light spurted on as minnie
opened the closet door it illumined a
wonderful silken thing hung in solitary
glory  one silk-padded hanger of the
metal cross-bar after a gape and a
gasp maura rushed to it and took it rev-
erently down

  it was a kimono of the palest lemon
lined with blue of spring-morning sky
color that rolled back to form the huge
loose cuffs and revers and scattered
over both lustrous silken surfaces were
sprays of cherry blossoms delicately
hued wonderfully wrought with a few
great butterflies poised amid the blos-
soms and miraculously done in every
shading of their spread wings-lemon
orange white scarlet splotched black-
streaked shimmering green

  mauras shoulders lifted with her
intaken breath

  hands never did it she declared
fairies made it and by some accident
dropped it here oh-i must get at
aunt claudia-

  minnie moved before her and stretched
a lean arm across the door

  no-no missy lamb please don
bother miss claudya jes now she got
some business with that fat ooman an
she jes nachrully couldnt put it off to
talk honey yo jes let me fill the barth
tub an put in some of this nice smellin
stuff an give yo a rub-down like i do
yo aunty an then well put on this yer
hansome dud an let her see how yo
does look

 well then-but hurry minnie-i
want to see the rest of the flat and
minnie im going to let my nails grow
long and awfully pointed like aunts and
shine them glittery like hers they look
so wickedy and oriental they never
let us do anything were dying to do at
school and im just going to revel here
she chattered incessantly while min-
nie worked her magic of elaborate clean-
liness it was so natural to be bubbling
and childish with good old adoring min-
nie that the corroding memory of
madames revelation was forgotten save
for one instant when she found herself
smiling vaguely at her own gleaming
white golden-haired reflection like a
gruesome shadow there flashed through
her mind the warnings against infatua-
tion with her own beauty and she turned
from the cheval glass with an impatient
frown but when she was fragrant and
frosty in lingerie with minnie standing
behind her chair and brushing out the
long strands of shining hair she talked
to the reflection of that beaming yellow
face as she saw it in the dressing-table
mirror and ignored her own allurement
below it the crashing of a door with-
out cut her short

  that woman has gone she twisted
in her chair open the door minnie
give me the kimono quick so i can

show-

  the door was opened-torn open-by
aunt claudia such a changed aunt
claudia her hat was askew the veil
pushed up over it as though she had
thrust it so hastily and she fumbled at
the high collar of her irish lace waist
tearing the mesh again and again as she
tugged her face was scarlet congested
furious


the tin star

  minnie-take this damned thing oft
me im choking get me-get me some-
thing quick-im being torn to pieces by
this cursed heart of mine feel it thump 
good business if it would burst and done
with it and i-minnie minnie the
word came out like the scream of a
frightened child

  instantly minnie had the fumbling
hands in one of her own and had loos-
ened the torn collar and put a steadying
arm about the tall figure as it wavered

  don yo be scared miss honey
she said fast over her shoulder yo
aunty she jes got a lil flutteration
cause she been goin too fas an shes
worrited yo jes look eround an ill be
right out-taint nothin yo can do
don be scairt

  maura sat transfixed the door of
her aunts room closed on the two but
it did not shut out the terrible burst of
weeping nor the crooning of minnies
voice and its occasional peremptory
sharpness as though she were command-
ing when soothing failed

  with a shiver of nervous chill maura
pulled on the gorgeous kimono giving
not a glance to the effect and ran out
from her room and from the corridor to
get where that distressing noise would
not torture her ears her mind was a
muddle of distaste real concern and in-
comprehensible fright

  she wandered to the dining-room but
drew back at the suddenly vivid recollec-
tion of the dreadful woman who had
confronted her there her aunts fur
coat was flung across a chair her gold
mesh bag dropped to the floor and there
was the heavy sweetness of port wine in
the air there seemed all at once too
much heat and perfume and incense
also she still glowed from her bath and
massage and her lungs accustomed to
the carefully ventilated air of the school
and constricted by her nervousness
craved ozone

  she crossed the hall to the drawing-
room and thrust aside the double hang-
ings-sage green brocade without deli-
cate rose within the changed aspect of
the room diverted her transiently for it
was quite as perfect as her changed bed-
room a silken persian rug the color

of dried roselcaves covered the shining
floor the handsome mahogany pieces
were upholstered in the same shade the
daylight entered tinged with the rose-
hued silk that hung over the costly lace
at the windows and there were masses
of roses all about-blush and pink and
scarlct a crystal bowl of killarneys on
a stand near the screened radiator
stirred a trifle as a gust of heat swept
out and a handful of petals dropped
noiselessly it suggested stifling oppres-
sion and she hurried across to the win-
dow nearest unfastened and opened it
wide

  for a second there was an out-surge
of silk and lace and perfumed heat then
the icy northwest wind swooped in
against the draught it was as though
a swift invisible sword cut through the
atmosphere but her lungs welcomed it
and drawing the wadded silk close she
stepped into the freezing swirl the
fierce sharpness of the assault made her
gasp and shut her eyes but her opened
lips caught at and inhaled it eagerly
her soft hair was caught up from about
her hips and whipped out behind her in a
tangle the noise of the street came up
to her the honking and sirens of motors
the pad-pad of hoofs on the asphalt and
the co-mingled rumble that was the citys
undertone

  i beg pardon said a voice behind
her-a mans voice and she wheeled as
though the wind had blown her about
it took her a second to put aside the
blinding mass of her hair and in that
second he had moved to the window and
closed it it was like the shutting out of
a clean wild spirit that had been kin to
something in her blood

  thats a rcckless thing to do said
the man but not as though he meant it
and coming back from the window he
stood beside her a very tall very broad
figure in his fur-lined coat of which the
broad collar of persian lamb oddly
matched his black tightly curled hair
his dark smooth-shaven face was deeply
lined but his rather fine black eyes were
contradictorily young and bright and his
full lips smooth and smiling at the con-
sternation in her face he smiled with un-
mistakable relish
the tin star



  am i to believe that you are the niece
miss claudia is so fond of

  maura found her voice

  yes i-miss herford is my aunt i
am sorry that i-i fancied myself alone
with the window up i did not hear your
ring

  his eyes had not left her face as she
spoke and he deliberately moistened his
lips with his tongue it was as horrible
as the flicker from a snakes fangs al-
though for her life she could not have
told why

  i did not ring the door was un-
fastened so i ventured-is miss herford
out 

 no-oh no she made answer so
hurriedly that she stammered they
are both-my aunt and minnie-here
but my aunt is not well you wished to
see her

 er-not necessarily to be quite
plain i came to see-you my curiosity
was aroused-i have heard so much of
you and he licked his lips again still
staring into her face his eyelids crink-
ling with his broadening smile i
am your aunts-er-man of affairs you
see he added and laughed softly un-
der his breath his broad shoulders shak-
ing that mirth could be menacing
maura had not known till she watched
this mans silent contented enjoyment
so absolutely did her intuition convince
her that she resented the matter-of-fact
acceptance of him that her reason urged

  lie shrugged the great coat off one
shoulder pulled his arm free and lazily
pushed off the other sleeve tossing the
coat to a chair it brushed a mass of
roses as it fell and sent a shower of
petals to the rug it was afternoon there
were people all about and minnie was
within call yet she was afraid he
was her aunts man of affairs-a fre-
quent caller yet she was afraid he
was an eccentric person amused at her
plight and her gaucherie and confusion
yet she was afraid without his coat he
was still tall and broad but lean and
slightly stooped but he moved easily
though slowly and anything about him
that hinted at age was set at naught by
as many evidences of surviving youth
and she had not imagined that a man

in mans restricted attire could convey
such an impression of sybaritic grooming

  suppose that we-er-talk he sug-
gested lapsing to his first moderate smile
once more tell me what you have
done and why i havent chanced on you
before and what you mean to do for
youve finished school of course and
i want to hear what you like and dis-
like-and all about you generally

  he let himself not ungracefully down
on a small sofa before the window and
gestured for her to take the other end
gestured and seated himself while she
was standing a quick mounting anger
swept away the curious lethargy of in-
explicable dread with which she watched
him

  you are very good to feel interest
in me-theres nothing to justify it
really and i must dress i will let my
aunt know that you are here

  dont go he said when she had
taken three steps he spoke quietly but
she stopped and looked over her shoulder
at him quickly she half expected to
find him crouched to spring after her
there had been such velvet menace and
intensity under his quiet but he sat as
she had left him-only he was not smil-
ing inexplicably she began to tremble
he smiled again and moistened his lips
with his tongue it was assured in-
solence that flicked alive her resentful
anger again she turned

  i tell you not to go from the tone
his smile had disappeared again but she
did not look to make sure she caught
the loose silk folds of her kimono close
and ran from the room hearing as she
brushed through the portieres the little
creak of the sofa as he got up from it
at that she fled literally toward the
door that shut off the sleeping room cor-
ridor stumbling against it as minnie
opened from the other side

 why-missy lamb baby- min-
nie began wonderingly-and then stiff-
ened as she looked involuntarily over
the girls shoulder and saw the man who
had come out in the hall

  wait till i splain to this genleman
that miss claudya aint seein anybody
ill be right in go long dearie miss
her hand on mauras shoulder gave a
i

the tin star

caressing pat but maura saw that the
brownish red lips were drawn tight and
that the jet eyes glittered so minnie
didnt like this man of affairs feeling
all at once protected she let herself be
thrust through the door and then grew
nervous again ran through her own door
closed and locked it

  she amazed herself by flinging off the
wonderful kimono as though it had been
contaminated by that interview-or
rather responsible for it and with trem-
bling fingers she braided the rebellious
hair tightly and wound it close about
her head

  what a silly you are she scolded
herself in the mirror as she fumbled for
hairpins you were not to blame for any-
thing-and that man understood that you
were just a little ignoramus-a simple-
ton-a schoolgirl and he only meant
to tease you a bit he didnt mean to
be rude really-he felt that his age ex-
cused-

  someone rapped and she cried out
faintly in terror that gave the lie to her
specious reasoning her hands flying to
a chair back with some wild notion of
self-defense but defense against what

  its only me honey one minnie
said softly come erlong out an get
yo tea taint nobuddy but jes yo an
me goin ter have it

  to her own disgust and mystification
maura began to cry as she got the door
open minnies strong arms reached out
and gathered her close

  don get all nervoused honey pet
dat man he-he come erbout money trou-
ble an i sent him on he way aflukin
minnies place was done over also in
buff and white enamel with shining alu-
minum utensils and a new much-nickeled
gas range and scarlet geraniums and
parsley and chives flourishing in pots on
a shelf before the window and the tiniest
of wicker rocking chairs in the tiniest of
spaces alongside maura dried her eyes
sniffled a little contentedly and looked
about

  i think this kitchen is the duckiest
place i was ever in she declared in a
fervor of enthusiasm id perfectly
adore standing on that weeny little mat
and reaching to the four walls for every-

thing i wanted-and its so spicy
scrubbed and shining clean i wish i
could cook cant i help now minnie
went off into rapturous chuckles as she
conjured a tea tray and doilies and sil-
ver and egg-shell china from nowhere in
particular she brought forth a starchy
white bib apron from somewhere and put
it over the dressing jacket the very
rustle of it made one feel domestic and
brisk then together they boiled wa-
ter after mastering the lighting of a gas
range and scalded the teapot and meas-
ured the costly leaves and set them to
making under the elaborate cozy and
for the first time the small white hands
made themselves useful in the practical
side of tray arranging shook out the
cress placed the butter balls upon it
artistically separated the crusty little tea
rolls that had been kept hot all the while
and sliced cake with every movement
the incident of the man of affairs and of
aunt claudias alarming seizure receded
into the background of her mind after
all nothing had happened and tea get-
ting was fun when she found herself
laughing naturally she was so overjoyed
that she kept  laughing at everything
that could serve as pretext in a hysterical
giggle that her years made tolerable
she was sitting sideways on the small
serving shelf the tea tray conveniently
near her foot swinging tomboy fash-
ion while she ate and drank and jabbered
and laughed when aunt claudia ap-
peared noiselessly in the doorway and
for the third time it was a different
aunt claudia

  she was becomingly pale her hand-
some eyes misty with slightly dilated pu-
pils her plumpness concealed by quite the
most wonderful hand-wrought muslin
negligee that maura had ever seen and
her dark hair hidden by a delectable
boudoir cap of muslin and lace and pink
rosebuds she was as unlike the domi-
neering aunt claudia of the station and
the profane aunt claudia of a few hours
back as one could imagine precisely the
sort of aunt to fly upon and kiss and
mumble over and serve with tea and
chatter to and be thankful for

  and youre not going to have what-
ever it was the matter with you again
the tin star

n

are yon-yotl handsomest thing maura
demanded finally a little hush came
into aunt claudias pale cheek

  no-dont worry i havent had an
attack before for ever so long im quite
all right now were going to the theatre
to-night-and please childy humor your
old aunt and wear a school frock so
many young people are home for holi-
days that it wont seem out of place-and
i detest those grown-up things

  as if i minded clothes maura
swooped forward to hug her again all
i care for is to go-and to go through
the giddy shops another day and to have
luncheon at one of those wonderful tea
places and to pick out pounds of candy
in a swagger place and to have hot choc-
olate at carlottas-and oh am i to go
to the opera

  you really are-and to-morrow and
all the rest of it aunt claudias eyes
had lost their mistiness as she looked up
at minnie she is our little girl min-
nie just as she was last christmas and
all the other years

  yassm agreed minnie fervently
she am dat and so for three days
she was

  there was all the old thrill about the
christmas city she throve on the child-
ish stimulants of crowded humming
stores and packed jostling tea rooms
and the snail-inoving crowds in the nar-
row streets grew giddy with the riches
of the jewelers where she chose for
herself a twisted triple string of seed
pearls almost identical with the one
madame permitted leila hilford to wear
at the school parties pinched herself to
make sure that it was she who dawdled
luxuriously through the revelations of a
turkish bath that outdid for costliness
all she had read of the romans indul-
gences  shivered deliciously in her chair
when the stage curtain rose showing the
feet of a fairyland chorus or the beyond-
date settings of a sentimental first act
and went quite off her head at the be-
wilderment of opera with aunt claudia
in black and gold and herself in school-
girl cobwebby white with ranks of bare
white be jeweled shoulders and tiers of
coruscating shirt fronts vying with the
magic of the performance and to crown

  jan-

all there was christmas coming every
day nearer until she woke late one gray
morning to find holly wreaths in botu
her windows the very snowstorm that
she had hoped for feathering the world
without and minnie smiling down  her
across the silver breakfast tray

  bes hang up yo two stockins ter-
night an no mistake know what day
dis is

  its the most exciting day of this
perfectly crazy week she smiled back
exultantly its the day before christ-
mas  and to-morrow-well it will be
simply the most wonderful christmas i
ever knew

  but it was a long time before she un-
derstood that her prophecy had been
true

ill

  from the janitors tiny parlor one
looked up to the sidewalk through an
ornate iron grille and judged the passers
by their foot gear and gaits and skirt bot-
toms to correct or to verify these im-
pressions it was necessary to scrouge
ones self close up to the high sill and
peer at as much of their profiles as luck
afforded

  the janitors wife was a tidy brisk
little person sandy rather pink nosed
but white skinned and the possessor of
unusual honest gray eyes and while her
tongue clacked busily to set her unex-
pected christmas guest at ease those can-
did eyes revealed pity and bewilderment
and admiration and disapproval and
whole-hearted unqualified womanly ten-
derness

  from the wreck of her sheltered lux-
urious little world maura stared dully
and felt that tenderness creep close and
warm to the very center of the sluggish
aching thing that was her heart

  just before midnight-on christmas
eve-after a childs day of hurry and
flurry and happiness and frivoling min-
nie had shaken her awake-roughly even
fiercely-and had clapped a stifling hand
over her mouth when she had murmured
drowsy protest fear never slow to re-
spond to fear had waked in her as she
blinked sufficiently awake to see min-
the tin star

nies rolling eyes and bared teeth and to
hear the hissing breaths she drew shiv-
ering with chill and fright she had lifted
herself clutching the brown wrists her
lips trying to form a noiseless whisper
and then she had heard the paralyzing
snarl half animal half human from the
hall beyond the short corridor that was
as unmistakable as the ravenous whine
of a charging tiger she had tried to
spring from bed but sheer terror numbed
her and minnie had dragged her up
bodily held her on her feet and pulled
her forward inches before she roused
herself to the necessity for walking
then supporting her with one hand
minnie had begun to undress herself
with incredible swiftness with the other

  the chill of the bathroom floor tiles
under her bare feet made her wince
bodily minnie had caught her under
the arms lifted her and swung her with
a stifled grunt of strain over the edge
of the half-sunken tub and had thrust
her behind the pushed-back curtain of
the shower had crushed her back cruelly
against the pipe and twitched the rubber
curtain before her flattening it so that
it seemed to swing slightly and naturally
out from the wall and all the time she
had hissed still fo gawds sake-
still still still

  instinctively maura had reached back
and grasped the cold nickel pipe against
which she was pressed and as that did
not afford support twisted her supple
arm tendril-fashion about it and gripped
the wrist with her free hand straining
herself upright and hard back that
painful linking seemed all that had kept
her from slipping down in a nerveless
huddle when her ordeal had but com-
menced it seemed the working of a pro-
tective impulse apart from her intelli-
gence

  minnie had slid across the floor the
light had snapped off and all the nerves

	her body had begun to come alive
someone was moving heavily through
the hall-scuffling she had made out
next instant-as though one body
dragged against another and with such
suddenness that she jerked violently
through every tense muscle her aunts
voice hoarse rasping stifled like the

ineffectual agony of one striving to speak
through a nightmare had burst through
the shuffling and dragging

 i cant-maura maura wake up
-get something fight-fight i cant
hold him maura- and then loud-
er and more vicious the snarl ripped
through the rasping cry there had come
the slide and thud of a weighty body
hurled aside and striking with sickening
force against a wall and then a quick
soft step through the corridor without
and a throaty soft devilish little chuckle
pretty-pretty little sweet wake up
and she had grown rigid with deathly
apprehension as she recognized the voice
of her aunts man of affairs

  he had paused on the threshold of her
room and must have gathered himself
animal-like for a leap because there
came a sleepy yawn-broken huh
from minnie and the chuckling snarl
and the soft sliding of a rug under the
blow of feet leaving the floor altogether
then a yelp from minnie her angry but
still sleepy voice in a babble of scolding
and the smack of a slap that had brought
the snarl again murderously

  dis yer aint miss claudyas room
snapped minnie what yo doin goin
round so tipsy yo don know wheah yo
at glong outn lieah now fore i lose
mail temper an bat yo goodn plenty
minnie-minnie a husky wail
from the hall implored take care of
her-get maura out-call the police oh
god let me die

  miss claudya a thud of bare feet
and minnie had raced out to the feeble
voice dat man hurt yo ef he have

he aint goin ter live-

  and all the while had sounded the low
sickening snarl breaking into dreadful
cursing and blasphemy and subsiding
again to its sound like the deadly worry-
ing of a dog while doors opened lights
snapped on chairs were pushed aside
and the soft tread of the man circled
nearer as he hunted ceaselessly he had
not been loud and destructive it would
have been easier to bear had he been in
that stage but he seemed fiendishly
cautious careful and stealthy as he
moved his maniacal rage seething in him
like the boiling of oily water too deep
the tin star



and thick to foam over and splutter off
in relieving steam

  he had gone to aunt claudias room
lighted that and searched in closets
moving couches opening a carved chest
and then to the bathroom

  maura-maura-oh where is she
where is she minnie at the rasping
croak from the hall he had turned and
sped out maura had felt her heart
surge check and surge again as it caught
at its half-stilled labor

  what yo want o dat child minnie
yapped she cornin back all right in er
mawnin she gone with a passel o
young ladies fum school what come in a
ottermobile dis evenin an taken her to
a party out er town-i got the place
wrote down some wheah-dat madame
whatever was with em dats why
i slep in her baid sos to tell yo when
you got in miss claudya-don yo be
worrited-

  at that aunt claudia had cried out
gaspingly had caught her breath in an
hysterical sob and had begun to cry
and the man had begun to curse epi-
thets that carried their own meaning
although she had never heard them be-
fore maura heard heaped on aunt clau-
dia on minnie on the place on the
money that clothed and fed them on the
very air they breathed and on the fate
that had made them stumbling blocks to
his will it had been such a blighting
torrent as it seemed should have with-
ered the brain that conceived and palsied
the tongue that uttered it

  if youre lying you yellow devil ill
cut you in inch pieces he rumbled at
minnie ill find her if theres length
to my life and money for the making
so you may as well out with the truth
now-ill have her sooner or later-you
hear he had seemed to move sud-
denly but minnie had grunted in menace
as animal-like as his own

  his snarl had sounded again but he
had felt the defiance to be earnest and
he moved off on his unsatisfied quest
there had been a clish of rings on por-
tiere poles as he stumbled into the draw-
ing-room and a faint bass hum from the
piano as he brushed its keys probably in
groping under it then he had entered

the dining-room then minnies kitchen
and the door from the kitchen shut be-
hind him as he padded through the back
halls maura heard minnies sharp com-
mand to her aunt and then they two
came slowly through the corridor and
into the bathroom without a whisper
or movement toward the curtain of the
shower minnie set the water running in
the bowl and began to take off her mis-
tresss waist

  hoi yo haid over she ordered
yo got a bad bump on yo forehaid
stop cryin-yo gotter be well on
chrismus when miss lambie gets
home at which aunt claudia had
burst out anew in thankfulness and min-
nie had scolded and splashed in the wa-
ter there had come the shutting of
the kitchen door again and a muffled
step on the rug without

  don yo go off in any tantrum now
-stop that shiverin minnie had bade
disgustedly and there had come a gush
from the faucets into the great tub

  maura felt a warm swirl about her
feet and it had seemed to send a warm
sick ripple up to her heart as she felt
the bottom of the curtain move slightly
before the next tortured heartbeat the
lead-weighted hem had settled again and
the thin nightdress she wore had be-
gun to soak up water she set her teeth
as the fabric weighted and clung to her
the clammy wetness rising bit by bit the
folds of the rubber curtain hugging
closer as they touched the soggy cloth 
but there had been some glimmer of
gratitude in her stupefied brain that her
locked arms held behind her that her
body was so slender and that-if it came
to the worst-minnie had a little knife
hung around her neck

  look at me the mans voice had
come so close and so dreadful that her
senses slipped a little further from her
mental grasp in their involuntary with-
drawal you cant make your eyes lie
to me claudia-if you know where she
is i can see it look at me there
had been the cruel strike of his palms
on bare shoulders and aunt claudias
gasp of pain and then a silence

  damnation then if she isnt here
ill stay till she comes he had flung


the tin star

himself across the floor to the window
the fire-escapes are the only places you
could have gotten her to-you hells nig-
ger you-

  window by window he had made sure
but had come back again snarling had
he been a trifle less master of himself he
would have laid hands on minnie to hurt
the truth from her but the memory of
her little knife seemed to stay with him
now and then he had chuckled and it
was almost worse than his snarl

  his horrible voice had begun a
rhapsody on mauras charms and broken
with snarls and chuckles it had gone on
and on like the utterance of some con-
niving demon her eyes shut a cold
sweat trickling under the saturated filmi-
ness of her nightdress her leaden body
locked to the pipe that held her upright
maura had heard her fate foretold as
though it were irrevocable heard every
hideous detail gloated over by the mad-
man who could have stretched out his
hand and grasped her through the smoth-
ering folds before he had finished
aunt claudia was huddled on the floor
moaning and crying and minnie was
breathing heavily as she labored to get
her mistress undressed and into the warm
bath when human endurance was
strained to its uttermost he stopped with
his indescribable chuckle

  dyou know what brought me here
to see her it was you claudia you
said too much to mislead me you said
too often that she was a plain poor
thing and gawky and young and pitiful
it didnt go with your anxiety to have
her think you a decent woman it didnt
go with the room you fitted up for her
nor with the money you got out of me to
fix the place over youve got yourself
to thank for anything that happens to
your lovely little niece my dear tell
your nigger to get me a drink bring it
to me here

  minnie had gone out instantly and the
man had turned his sardonic attention
wholly to the groveling woman on the
floor

  such a stupid claudia he sneered
to think she could outwit me havent
you waked to the fact that it was i who
sent old nancy to be here when you got

home with the girl the first day there
isnt a keener eye for beauty in the
trade to-day than nancys and when she
reported to me that the girl was worth
any money i had to pay i knew i guessed
right and you poor fool-swallowed
the yarn that old hag fed you about being
commissioned to get the girl by some un-
known man who had seen her some un-
known place i used to think you were
clever claudia but you are losing your
quickness as you are losing your looks
you are fat and a fool your niece is
probably a fool too-but she is young
divinely deliciously young and slim and
sweet and i want her wheres that
nigger if shes tip to any trick-

  he had come back from his stealthy
rush out to the kitchen chuckling and
snarling

  such a clever pair then he had
cursed them both your yellow devil
had a nice hot brew for you claudia
dear in a separate glass so that you
shouldnt drink from the decanter she
meant for me so i have taken your
glass and you are at liberty to drink
from the decanter it would serve you
right if i made you do it youd prob-
ably go very sound asleep immediately
and sleep so long that youd miss grcet-
ing your niece when she arrives but i
shall riot permit myself to be cheated out
of such pleasure as i anticipate to
your health my dear minnie-i drink
to your confusion

  and he had laughed at them had
drained his glass and let it break on the
tiled floor with a sullen grunt minnie
had dragged her mistress up and forced
her from the room suspiciously the
man had followed had thrust himself
into the bathroom again when minnie at
last succeeded in getting the hysterical
woman into the hot bath  and then on
another impulse had searched the other
rooms again as though some dulled sixth
sense had warned him that he was being
deceived yet not by touch nor murmur
had minnie reassured the cause of it
all

  feeling had left the girls limbs grad-
ually aunt claudia had stepped into
the water obediently and out again as
minnie bade and the tub was drained
the tin star



the light turned off the cramped arm
twisted about the pipe had seemed like
a dead limb that still could feel gnawed
by innumerable tiny blunt-toothed crawl-
ing things the evaporation of her thin
gown chilled her aching tensed body so
that uncontrollable little shivers shook
her in spite of all her desperate endeavor
at control from fear lest she could not
stay upright she had found herself drift-
ing to a leaden despondency that made
it of small consequence whether she
stayed hidden or dropped and let the
man have his way because all her pretty
world of illusion had been shattered in
her hearing and she dreaded the foul
chaos she must face when she stepped
from concealment but even dread had
came dully-mind and heart shared the
queer numb stolidity of her body
vaguely she had recalled that it was
christmas eve only christmas eve and
lot many years since her delicious wak-
ing of that morning she recalled later
that she had heard bells and a far-away
music at some time while she listened
so acutely and that must have been the
dawn of christmas morning-christmas
morning her wonderful christmas
she had tried to feel the tragedy of it
but her eyes had stayed dry she had
wondered weakly how it would be pos-
sible to live the rest of her life without
feeling anything-ever again and then
she had heard the mans stealthy step
just outside the bathroom door

  he was muttering about her drunkenly
and vengefully and sick fear had seized
her again to give the lie to her hope that
feeling had left her the man had
stopped muttering and seemed to listen
and that was when her terror reached
its climax her heart thudded in what
seemed to her a thunderous beat and a
nervous shiver beset her so that the
wet inner surface of the curtain rubbed
slightly with a sound as of friction on
silk against her bare arms he had
stepped forward and she opened her lips
to scream and he had yawned-a re-
assuring unmistakable yawning aloud
that seemed to come from a man fairly
drugged with sleep he tried to speak
but another yawn seized him

  cl-claud-ia- he had said stu-

pidly and crossed to the door dragging
his feet-and stopped to yawn gigan-
tically then he had seemed to lean
against the wall as he moved on making
the excessively wearied noises at inter-
vals till he crossed the threshold of her
room she had heard the scraping of a
chair that he struck against-then silence

   minnie had slipped into the bathroom
noiseless as a shadow and pulled away
the rubber curtain she had ungripped
the right hand from the wrist it held
and had untwisted the paralyzed arm
that was twisted about the pipe she
had not spoken but in a dazed shamed
sidelong look maura had seen that the
lean face was wet with tears

  silently minnie had sponged her off
with hot water and alcohol had brought
dry things moving carefully but not
fearfully from the ivory and yellow
room had sounded the rattling snoring
of a man fatigued nearly to death or
very drunk-or drugged in her fresh
nightdress and warm bathrobe with
ileecy slippers on the feet that minnie
had rubbed to life maura had stolen
past her own door guided by the faith-
ful hand and out to the tiny kitchen
where the kettle sang cheerily on the
bright nickeled range she had dropped
into the small chair and stared at the
blue flame and the funnel of steam
and had wanted to cry at the homelike
scene and the peace of such things after
-after what had been but she could
not cry silently minnie had prepared
a cup of malted milk and some crisp
toasted crackers and had brought them
to her on a shining tray she had turned
away her head

  drink it minnie had whispered
drink it honey lamb yo-got to
so she had swallowed the hot tastily
seasoned beverage and then had stood
obediently as minnie slipped a hand un-
der her elbow she had admonished her-
self that she should do-something but
in all her life she had never acted for
herself and the double hopelessness
crushed everything-even resentment
they had traveled downstairs and down-
stairs and downstairs till they had come
to the huge pillars of the buildings base-
ment past black funnels and huge boil-


the tin star

ers that hissed faintly minnie had led
her along a floor littered with packing
boxes and empty long pasteboard boxes
with the names of florists stamped huge
on the corners and so in the dim light
to a plain door set in a board wall with
an electric bell to the right of the knob
minnie had rung long and presently the
door had opened and a tall sleepy
brusque-voiced man had thrust his head
out

  now wot he had demanded aint
there a bell hin yer apartmint but you

must be a-comin- there he had

blinked awake sufficiently to make out
maura standing back and staring at him
and he had stopped short and grown
apologetic

  wots up anythink the trouble
and then at a murmur from minnie
the missis wye hi aint wishin to

call er unless- then he had glanced

toward the girl again and with a curt
vurry well had disappeared in a re-
markably short time his wife had ap-
peared her hair in curling papers and
a comfortable red bathrobe held about
her person and minnie had beckoned
her one side and spoken fast and low

  dear heart the woman had said
thrice over amazingly contented maura
had waited watching her their ac-
cent-man and womans-reminded her
so strongly of the gardener at school and
his wife the assistant housekeeper that
the four fused ridiculously in her
thought she had thought she should
never sleep again and yet with every in-
stant she had felt sleep like a weight
pressing down upon her and all at once
her jaws had stretched in a prodigious
yawn she had heard sickness and
danger and then sir maury digby
in the murmur of words and then a
whispered bit from minnie that made
the woman cross to her and take her
hand she had smiled faintly and drow-
sily and the woman had ejaculated dear
heart again and had patted her and
then there was an extraordinary bed that
dropped down from the wall and showed
itself made up atop of what had been a
wardrobe front with a large mirror it
hadnt mattered that it was queer  noth-
ing had mattered save that she should

be permitted to sleep-to sleep all that
she wanted and her last recollection
had been of minnies face bending over
her and minnies hand patting the

covers

  and when she had opened her eyes it
was christmas morning in the janitors
parlor with the sun edging in between
the great iron grilles and feet jumbling
along the sidewalk above as she could
see through the mesh of the coarse lace
curtains at first she had thought it
merely interesting then it had grown
mystifying and then a sluggish trickle
of recollection had begun to seep into
her mind  and as though she had felt
the wakening need of reassurance min-
nie had come into the room with fresh
linen over her arm and one of the
school dresses and she had said-in
spite of everything-huskily mey
crismus dear lil missy love mey
chrismtts

  after all the tears hadnt come they
had surged mightily within but had
seemed to break against an impassable
barrier and to sink back bitterly to their
source she had flung herself back on
the pillow her arm across her eyes her
teeth in her lower lip

 missy-missy lamb- she had

felt minnies pat on the coverlet over her
feet don yo go a-breakin yo lil
heart honey pretty taint no time t
talk now but jes yo keep yo courage
up an yoll be took care of some place
ilowd yo like goin t englant see yo
pas folks ony jes fo tday yo stay
heah with these kin folks an try ter fer-
get things of minniell watch out
dearie lamb an now yo got to write
a paper fo me honey

  from some unexplained source she had
secured paper and envelopes of the citys
best hotel and because she was willing
to be directed by this one creature who
had proved honest maura wrote a few
lines to her aunt

  tell her yo been told all about what
sorter woman she been minnie had
prompted tell her yo got it fm that
madame which runs the school yo been
to an tell her madames goin to start
yo fo englan some time soon an how
yo ain never cornin back nohow un-
the tin star



der the circumstances it had been easy
to write and she wished wretchedly that
it were true as to the use that would
be made of it or the consequences to
herself she had asked nothing only
when minnie reappeared with a break-
fast tray did she think of a thing that
had puzzled her

 you gave me something in that
malted milk to make me sleep didnt
you 

 yes honey lamb minnie had an-
swered without apology

 and that-you gave him something
too

 yes missy dear i reckoned hed
jes nachully take the contrary one fm
what i tried to give him and minnies
face set savagely yo dinnerll be sent
down-a reglar chrismas dinner fo all
o yo an-lambie-jes yo try an
make these folks glad they took yo in
don yo go a-spoilin chris mus day fo
nobuddy else an mebbe the lord hell
credit yo fo it sometime

  it had been good advice maura recog-
nized vaguely it reminded her of miss
riggsons pray do not fancy that others
are interested in your grievances pre-
serve a decent reticence in such matters
and so although she brooded over the
misery the last hours had brought her
she kept the surface of herself calm
that this strange haven wherein chance
had tossed her should not be disquieted
by her presence

  the janitors wife had appeared in the
doorway as minnie went out with the
tray and wished her merry christmas
with such sincerity as to be almost con-
vincing and had appeared again very
soon to put the red plush album and a
complete manual of etiquette at her
disposal along with a pile of ragged
magazines

 they send em down in the wyste
barskets she enlightened her guest an
you carnt think wot a treat it is to get
good readin for nothink

  at intervals from without there would
come the rattle of coal the scrape and
thud of running feet  the concrete
passage and occasionally a tremendous
dull bumping as though several weighty
persons had fallen down many flights of

stairs it occurred to the janitors wife
to enlighten her

  all that coalin is wilkes boomin up
the boilers miss she gave her informa-
tion from the doorway an that run-
nin is the delivery boys from the shops
with one thing an another-bein oli-
day theyre rushed somethink terrible
an that bumpin as you may ave heard
thats the garbidge cans a-bein drugged
down the back stairs from the upper
floors it mykes a good bit o noise but
when youre well used to it its nothink

  thank you-i dont mind its good
of you to explain maura made herself
answer civilly and mrs wilkes unusu-
ally fine eyes narrowed a little in a keen
look of interest as she bobbed smiling
and withdrew carefully closing a door
that shut out the sound of her domestic
activities it was no time at all before
she opened the door again and came to
the threshold with a little rush of de-
termination

  beggin your pardon miss but it do
seem so sort of agen the spirit of this
blessed dye to ave you sittin in ere
all alone an worrited an the sun is
leavin these winders anll be round to the
back in no time an im makin bold to
say that id be proud an pleased to ave
you make use of my kitchen if you feel
so to do at any time which there is a
chair for you out o the way of spat-
terin an willyum can go out with his
farther

 thanks-youre very kind- as

she half turned in the creaking plush
chair maura saw herself in the mirror
she had tried to avoid that reflection
because she knew that once she looked at
it full there would come such an acute
realization of her position as she had
not yet suffered to her still numbed
senses hazed as they were by the linger-
ing opiate there seemed a separation be-
tween the maura wayne who had lived
through a century of horror and herself
sitting stupidly in an underground par-
lor and conjecturing as to the passers by
whose feet obstructed her daylight but
once she looked close and long into the
eyes of the girl in the looking-glass
she felt that their humiliation would be
hers unbearably she stood abruptly to


the tin star

get away from the possibility that would
become a compelling fascination once she
had contemplated it ill come now if
i may please she almost besought

  maura stood at the kitchen door and
drew a long breath it was a kitchen
twice the size of minnies and every whit
as clean there was no enamel no flash-
ing silver or aluminum to be sure but
on one side close by the black shining
range were rich gleaming coppers and
mellow brown jugs and speckless stew-
pans that had unmistakably crossed the
water with mrs wilkes the wooden
chairs were set in primly under the stiffly
ironed linen tablecloth that in all prob-
ability had been one of the linen pieces
in her dower chest and the chest itself
-fine shimmering worn brown oak-
stood in the place of honor under a high-
silled window where red geraniums blos-
somed bravely in the slanting sun that
was just feeling its way in across them
the curtains were of crisp muslin fresh-
ly laundered the three cheap splint
armchairs were gay with clean chintz
cushions and head rests and between
them signifying the separation of living
and cooking sections was laid a strip
of gay green carpet on the white
scrubbed floor

  if youll suit yourself with a chair
miss-an i ave a cup o beef tea ready
because im knowin to it that you ate
nex to nothin this mornin but first if
youll excuse me ill just be gettin will-
yum off to is farther so as youll not
ave im worritin round miss willyum
come ere

  there was silence for the space of a
half minute then as though he chose the
lesser evil william scuffed softly from
his shelter behind a chair on the further
side of the table and stood before them
both pudgy pink hands outspread to
cover his eyes and as much of his face
as might be

  cupid in the smallest possible blue
overalls and white cotton flannel shirt
with over large rubbers on his stubby
feet would look very like william wilkes
at the moment of his appearing before
the young lady he dreaded his loose
rings of hair were fairer than her own
and the radiant cleanliness of him from

pink cheeks to square toes was irre-
sistible

 maura made an overture toward
friendliness but the child backed off and
crawled under the table

   ell come right in no time his
mother assured her apologetically

  i know maura smiled youre
very comfortable here

  her glance about the room was un-
mistakably admiring mrs wilkes
beamed

  we are that miss an grateful ac-
cordin

  involuntarily maura looked at the
square kitchen table that was so whim-
sically enriched with hand-woven linen
and daily thanksgiving mrs wilkes
misunderstood

  your dinners to be served to you in
the parlor miss she gave hasty correc-
tion with everythink sent down as you
was to ave it-

  impulsively maura opened her lips to
protest remembered the baby under the
table and closed them again on an inex-
plicable pain there came a queer muf-
fled knocking at the door

  bless us if i dont believe the words
ave been taken out o my mouth mrs
wilkes exclaimed bustling to open
they had with his arms clasping as
much of a huge packing box as they
could compass wilkes edged his way
through the door rolled his eyes wildly
at the young lady before whom circum-
stances constrained him to pass covered
tottered halfway into the room and eased
his burden to the floor then straightened
and snatched off the offending cap duck-
ing repeatedly

  not knowin as you was ere miss
he apologized with an indignant glance
at his wife not bein told as you were
in this room-

  lawks  the young leddy saw as ow
you ad ver ands full cut in mrs
wilkes with the permissible excitement
of a housewife in the presence of food
that called for attention lend  and
wilkes an look alive

  wilkes was totally unable to look
alive his countenance beinf- of the one-
expression sort much chin pugnacious
nose eyes as changeless as discs of blue
the tin star



china and a tight mouth his few emo-
tions he expressed by variation in tint
of his ruddy complexion and the faintest
up or down quirk to his lips but he put
at his wifes service two wonderfully ca-
pable and dexterous hands that relieved
her of everything save directing in the
unpacking of his weighty box

  the kitchen filled slowly with the
blended fragrance of roasting and bak-
ing and spices and fruit wilkes dived
fast producing prodigious green and
purple grapes huge oranges and ruddy
apples gold-sealed bottles a gold-corded
box of candies a basket of nuts and
raisins a pineapple two tins that opened
to show hot crusty rolls and a quart
thermos bottle which he had been advised
contained black coffee then a layer of
cardboard and more packages oh
theres enough for all of us cried
maura

  mrs wilkes stood back a pucker be-
tween her fine eyes the tip of her nose
very pink

  its vurry fine she said in a voice
not quite steady an ill do my best to
finish it orf proper for the young leddy
likewise serve it hup but as for keepin
anythink for ourselves-when we were
glad an proud to take in the young
leddy- she shook her head deter-
minedly

  wilkes opened his mouth in blank dis-
may stared at her fishily a second passed
an arm across his damp forehead shut
his mouth and turned miserable eyes on
the abundance that he was to be denied
from under his brows he shot a hesitat-
ing glance at the young lady herself
and was cast down to observe that she
was not paying them the slightest atten-
tion her gaze was fixed under the table
as though she saw something there that
interested her

  the soles of two small rubbers had
worked their way into sight under the
hem of the linen cloth and third way
up a shining fold was pushed out in a
tiny peak that could be accounted for
only by supposing an ardently sniffing
nose to have approached as closely as it
dared to the excitement and alluring
smell

  rising swiftly maura seized an orange

an apple and twisted a spray of luscious
purple grapes from a mammoth bunch
then knelt and lifted the cloth just enough
to allow her laden right hand to pass in
beside the absorbed occupant of the space
under the table the rubbers became
agitated and hitched back from sight
breathless she stayed still while mrs
wilkes and her husband craned across to
stare down at her silence under the
table then a feathers weight touch on
her finger-a lightening of the treasure
in her hand and she knew that the
grapes had been taken a tiny hand
brushed hers and the orange was accept-
cd the apple offered difficulties to his
laden small fists so he calmly knocked
it off her palm and fell over upon it to
prevent its escape

  maura sat back in a graceful huddle
 the white floor and looked up into the
attentive parent faces she was wholly
unaware that the sun made an aureole
about her fair braids lighted her clear
skin to an almost translucent marvel and
glittered in the tears that clung to her
thick lashes enhancing the black and
amber wonder of her eyes

  he-your baby-took fruit from
me she told them in an ecstatic voice
he wouldnt mind then-if you were
willing-i know one doesnt like a
stranger in ones family on an intimate
day like this-but if you would let
me-

  mrs wilkes turned pale then pink
wilkes straightened deep red and deeply
moved

  elizer he said solemnly do you
ear wot you are bein arst ave you
forgot the day it is an your christan
dooty 

  i aint thinkin of my christan
dooty mrs wilkes broke out with most
amazing energy im thinkin wot a
beastly ungrateful one i am arfter my
fine talk o chrismas an all i ad a
proud heart about acceptin all this grand
feast instead of knowin that our eave-
enly father would like me to take it as
a part o is lovin kindness  is dear
sons birthday

  with a scramble and a rush maura
was up and had her arms about the plump
gray calico shoulders


the tin star

  oh thank you she cried eagerly

  by the time wilkes returned shaven
and scrubbed and awkward in his sun-
day best the table was laid for four the
roasted goose proclaimed itself by a per-
vading savoriness the shining stove was
filled thick with busy cooking utensils
and on a side table the gold-topped bot-
tles flanked the colorful mounds of fruit
the smug abundance of nuts and the un-
wonted spectacle of three sorts of cheese
wilkes grew congested above his glitter-
ing collar

  weres buster he demanded as
one whose surfeit must be shared the
splint rocking-chair swayed a signal
wilkes made sure his son was the source
of the motion and cast a dubious eye
on his active wife

  when at last they were all gathered
about the heavily laden table and grace
had been said mrs wilkes spoke gently
to maura to break her deep absorption

  the old countryll be new to you i
take it miss she asked hesitatingly
maura seized on the opportunity to avow
her separation from the clarss to
which wilkes had referred during the
day-a clarss unmistakable

  ive been at school all my life-all
that i can remember and my father died
before i was old enough to hear of his
home it will-yes it will be new to
me

  with her face still suffused with shame
she felt the lifting of the old optimism in
her heart things always had been ar-
ranged somehow since england had
been spoken of why not expect to go
there and why not hope for the favor
of sir maury digby and forgetfulness
of this christmas eve that would in time
fade to the forgotten horror of all night-
mares she looked up with a brightness
that made mrs wilkes stare in amazed
relief

  tell me about it your home that was
and mine that is to be

  during the rest of the meal the im-
promptu hostess babbled happily of her
girlhoods surrey

  after dinner wilkes combined his
proper christmas punch while mrs
wilkes got the main burden of the dishes
off her mind and then they sat in a semi-

circle about the clean and newly-shining
stove and had their nuts and raisins and
sipped the punch while william lan-
guidly cuffed his ball about the floor and
gazed at the plethora of goodies he had
not been able to eat

  get your accordion father do
urged mrs wilkes

   oo wants to ear that ol growler
he objected visibly flattered

  we all do maura assured him and
thereupon mrs wilkes brought it from
the inexhaustible chest

  he thrust his fingers through the end
straps grumbling about his lack of prac-
tise and the blighted contrariness of cer-
tain keys and his inability to play after
dinner anyway but with the first wail of
sound from the reeds he forgot his pre-
tense and employed himself in express-
ing his carefully hidden soul through his
marvelously deft fingers and the an-
tiquated instrument reels and hymns
and jigs and folk songs scraps of operas
he had heard somehow somewhere pop-
ular songs and heart-breaking old ballads
he contrived to coax into sound and
enliven with feeling william drifted up
to observe the miracle of his fathers
fingers making music and abstractedly
leaned against the young ladys chair
when he had shifted from one foot to
the other four times and his intent blue
eyes had winked slowly thrice she dared
put out her arm stealthily and draw him
toward her he looked around at her
quickly but she kept her eyes on the
accordion and he looked that way to see
what he might be missing between his
absorption and his growing drowsiness
she managed to lift him to her lap and
after a stiff moment he relaxed and lay
back against her shoulder lulled by the
music and the swaying of the rocker
and so at last she held him the enticing
flanneled cupid felt the adorable soft-
ness of his little body in her arms had
the round fragrant soft-curled head
against her shoulder and the hunger that
had seized her on her first sight of him
was appeased

   eell be too eavy murmured mrs
wilkes touched beyond words maura
shook her head impatiently wilkes
after a sighing chord let his tired fingers
the tin star

 

relax and as the music ceased the
drowsy baby eyes opened wide purely
from desire to keep him soothed and in
her arms maura took up the whispering
note of the air and began very softly
to weave it into a lullaby wilkes looked
up sharply and his wifes mouth opened
just as the musicianly fingers had
strayed so she sang quiet songs strains
the accordion had taught her quaint bal-
lads that her music master had drilled
her in-all subdued to the sleepy time
but there came to her as she ob-
served the breathless attention of the
elders a recollection of her last song at
school when the girls had accorded her
such unusual attention if they could
see her now-or if these people could
have seen her then she drew a deeper
breath and started the song she had sung
on that occasion but the heavy little
head on her breast stirred with the first
piquant run and she broke off in a tune-
less crooning it seemed more impor-
tant than all else that william wilkes
should stay with her very slowly in
a mere sweet whisper she droned
the old lullaby from erminie through
and half through again the nestling
head dropped against her throat the
chubby little hands relaxed the long
lashes lay sealed in a dusky semicircle
on the flushed cheeks and the siege was
won

  for a long time they sat silently look-
ing at the little bright rim of fire that
showed under the waqed cover of the
stove basking in full-fed music-lulled
unthinking fire-gazing calm then
wilkes sighed contentedly got up and
tiptoed to the chest with his accordion
tiptoed back and halted with his hand
on his wifes shoulder

  suddenly the door opened behind
mauras chair and someone came in

  for a second the girl stayed rigid her
foot outthrust to check the swing of the
chair and the baby clutched to her so
lightly that he squirmed in muscular re-
sentment  then she turned slowly as
she rose

 it was minnie even as she had
guessed minnie smiling and bowing
and congratulatory freshly starched and
reassuring enough in view of her loy-

alty but the sight of her served to re-
call sharply that this peaceful day
had been but hiding after all that
yesterday had been illusion and to-mor-
row-

  well i cernly am glad to see yo
makin the bes o things missy honey
she purred yo aunty is better some
an she wish to see yo upstairs direckly
jes say good-by to these folks an thank
em an les not waste no time i dunno
but mebbe yo goin start fo new yawk
on a late train sos to be all ready to take
the ship soons yo aunty can git up an
pack

  maura stayed as she was sullen sus-
picious resentful she believed not a
word of that smiling assurance and her
throat felt tight and hot with the repres-
sion of tears that even christmas day
should be broken in upon by some neces-
sity for evasion the grotesque folding-
lied in the parlor seemed infinitely de-
sirable the placid hearty tea seemed the
chief feast of the day now that it was
to be denied and william-

  william began to whimper and then
to cry and flounder in her arms wilkes
took him and mrs wilkes the tea-
caddy in her hands bade him hush

  not leavin without tea that hos-
pitable soul demanded and of all things
to be started a-journeyin on a chris-
mas she spoke to minnie and her
tone held the veiled asperity of a proper
married woman speaking to the servant
of one of the clarss to which wilkes
had blunderingly referred

  yes maam minnie evaded bland-
ly its too bad but we aint got no time
to waste missy lamb

  vivid remembrance of the good rea-
son minnie had for haste when she had
urged it not so many hours back start-
ed maura from her illogical stubborn-
ness

  i-im quite ready she said hastily
putting out both hands to mrs wilkes
youve been very kind to me-i shant
forget it-and please dont forget me

promise you wont-both of you-

she swung to wilkes who embarrassed
at her proffered hands motioned william
clumsily toward the arms of his mother
william rudely wakened and irritated


the tin star

resented the proposed exchange with
lusty screaming

  oh please maura exclaimed
willy billy boy dont spoil the picture
i take away of you  stop it stop it-
please and say good-by to me

  with an adoring babble maura kissed
him all over his moist face and gave him
to his mother

  good-by-good-by you dear people
-good-by somehow she and mrs
wilkes came together and kissed
wilkes crushed her fingers and she
swooped down on william for a fare-
well embrace and then she and minnie
were going up the dimly-lighted back
stairs and the wilkes were becoming
with every step a dear desirable im-
possible background for the interview
with aunt claudia outside their own
kitchen door minnie stopped her

  yo aunty she been mighty upset
mighty so she blieve that lil note
bout yo goin away she jes nachally
had to blieve it cause ef she knew
wheah yo was she couldnt keep fm
showin it an she had a time when
she foun out yo was heah now don
yo talk none missy lamb yo don
wanter ferget she taken mighty good
care o yo all this long while yo jes
mind that

  aunt claudia was upset when the
noisy breathless half hour was ended
abruptly by minnie who declared that
the time for talking was over and that
the taxi would be at the door in fifteen
minutes maura found herself relaxing
from that storm of words as from a phy-
sical buffeting but she had remem-
bered minnies admonition

  the yellow hand rested on her shoul-
der tenderly a second as the invaluable
one whipped the traveling suit into place
with miraculous deftness

   sll right missy baby-its goin ter
be all right she whispered yo chirk
up an keep yo courage gimme yo han
heah tell i put yo glove on

  maura put out her right hand almost
stupidly things happened so fast that
it was numbing minnie had to tell her
again to open her fingers with a curi-
ous little shock of homesickness she
went down to the waiting car

iv

  mrs corey thriftily lived in the back
parlor of her lodging-house but it
was such a comfortable even luxurious
back parlor that it did not occur to one
to think of her as cramped or self-deny-
ing until she enlarged cheerfully on
how very comfortable it was

  that if anybody had thought of it
marked mrs corey as a character worth
analyzing

  she could tell you delightedly what
she had treated herself to for her soli-
tary dinner and you would decide to
stop in at the provision store next day
and send her a porterhouse steak or a
guinea-hen so that she would know
what a real treat was she would joy-
ously put a dab of costly perfume on
your nose from the infinitesimal trial bot-
tle that she had gone without something
to buy and you would see to it that
next day she found another on her table
-or a full-sized one if you were in
funds mrs corey in short could cast
a crumb on the waters in her beaming
infantile way and it would return to
her a full-sized loaf fresh-baked-and
buttered

  there were things one disapproved of
in mrs corey to be sure but she her-
self disapproved of them so candidly and
humorously that it was disarming she
stated frankly that she was taking it
easy because she had worked so hideous-
ly hard all her life and her pale merry
eyes would fill with reminiscent tears and
you would pity her for the hard past
she had known rather than resent the
astounding indolence of her present she
was hearty in condemnation of her own
insatiable novel-reading but she re-
marked with a whimsical crooked smile
that she hadnt had any romance in her
own life and that she was just old fool
enough to like to pretend that all the ex-
periences of all the heroines had hap-
pened to her impartially she called her-
self an old fool likewise because she
waved her scanty light hair and pol-
ished her nails endlessly and reveled in
frilly negligees and girlish kimonos and
cosmetics and because she worshiped
matinees and whipped cream even if
the tin star



one couldnt disagree with her one
couldnt utterly condemn her after that
and she had a deeper side decidedly
lounging on her soft cushions in her
sweet-smelling warm prettily lighted one
room it seemed the most natural thing
in the world to drift into confidences that
wouldnt seem indiscreet till one recalled
them afterward partly because human
nature loves to analyze itself partly be-
cause it was absolutely certain that one
would receive sympathy and understand-
ing-because mrs corey was never
shocked even to the degree of shaking
her head sagaciously and partly be-
cause she babbled so frankly of people
and happenings in her own past that she
seemed to have nothing to conceal and
no reservation it took more serious re-
flection than one was apt to give her to
discover that her interesting and rather
spicy anecdotes revealed nothing at all
of her own past beyond the general
preface of in one of my lodging-
houses one gathered that she had al-
ways lived in a back parlor and had al-
ways been the recipient of confidences
life in all its phases was an open book
to her but she seemed always to have
read from the book and never to have
memorized nor to have applied any of
its teachings her mental workings
seemed all on the surface her predilec-
tions harmless foolish natural

  if you had never seen mrs coreys
like before and were comfortably cer-
tain that you should never see her nor
her like again you would doubtless have
accepted her as maura wayne accepted
her-tolerantly compassionately but
with undeniable interest and there was
moreover a strong element of gratitude
to be reckoned with

  it is mercifully ordained that the full
consequences of a calamity are not per-
ceived at the instant of its happening
if it were so-or in the happily few
cases when it is so-life would and does
cease so although she perceived dimly
that all she had thought of her life had
been illusion that all that was to come
was vague beyond imagining and that
she had been saved from a horror so
black that she would never be able to
visualize it maura had not known how

impassably she was cut off from her old
manner of existence until her taxi
bumped and skidded through the snowy
city streets  that christmas night after
her scene with her aunt claudia

   she had found a heavy-breatliing silk-
rustling and carnation-scented black
woman awaiting her in the car an apish-
faced woman who had murmured gut-
turally with a flash of white teeth inten-
ded to be conciliating at minnies quick
assurance that this frien o minell
see you safe on the way honey miss-
jes as safe as id do it but beyond a
yesm i will miss the unknown pro-
 lector had made no attempt at conversa-
tion it would indeed have been im-
possible for the panes of the cab might
have been windows opening on destiny
so absorbing so enviable so agonizing
were the glimpses they revealed

   maura saw a lighted limousine full of
sparkling wonderfully cloaked and coif-
fured women and silk-hatted men a
white-capped maid drawing the curtains
at lace-hung holly-wreathed windows a
butler massed black against an outpour-
ing of ruddy light opening the door of a
sumptuous private club a group of
diners-out going up the steps to a hospit-
ably wide door that showed the standard
of the newel-post light bound with greens
and scarlet ribbon faces caught here and
there-in cars at crossings under arc
lights-faces of groups of pairs of sin-
gle pedestrians hurrying leisurely
laughing talking earnestly and every-
thing and everyone normal secure sane
moving in a world from which she was
shut out by no act of her own her
gloved hands gripped together in her
muff as the unanswerable injustice of it
quickened her comprehension it was so
preposterous that her mind refused to
grapple with it at once

  im maura wayne-maura wayne
- she said over and over in a word-
less rhythm that punctuated the whirring
engine if she could but get back to the
old significance of maura wayne the
permanent pupil at madame laroches
school for young ladies all this intol-
erable nightmare she was having would
vanish and then her nostrils were as-
sailed by a stronger gust of carnation


the tin star

as the silk bulk beside her stirred and
coughed discreetly and it was no night-
mare 

  why cant i cry why cant i cry
she felt herself wondering excitedly
if i cry and make a scene i can stop
this craziness that is carrying me so far
from everything right and decent i
never did anything to anyone-i
shouldnt be punished for other peoples
avickedness and things like this simply
dont happen if one has courage to fight
and appeal to anyone for help im only
a girl it is my right to cry-to scream
out to these people to be taken from this
woman to be protected rightly to cry
out this hurt and ache that is eating
me- but with another half of her-
self she knew that she wouldnt and
couldnt unwittingly she had touched
the steel in her make-up

   fore we get there missy will you
please to put this veil on minnie she
give it to me fo yo as the woman
spoke she deftly flung a huge brown
chiffon square over the trig hat of ma-
dames choosing and swept its surplus
fullness in a swathing fold about the
girls chin through that thickness and
color the striking fairness might have
been minnies own yellow

  maura sat perfectly still her thoughts
congealing under a chill fear was her
danger greater than she could guess

  were goin in the day coach missy
the soft guttural went on minnie she
say to not so many folks in there
you can lay back in er corner an nap
an i got a lunch in mah bag an then
yo cn sleep to-morrow

  maura wondered where she would
sleep but already she had learned to
fear what the future might hold she
who had radiantly demanded and ex-
pected  she understood that there
would be less likelihood of recognition
in the common car in case    she
did not finish even in her own mind
she shrank back in a corner of the un-
accustomed seat after their hurried
crossing of the station and the negress
protectingly crushed in beside her loom-
ing between her and the passengers that
clumped up the uncarpeted aisle when
they were under way she turned over the

seat ahead and sat facing her charge
she was very black very stout elabor-
ately dressed and evidently rather de-
lighted with her dramatic role but un-
der the surface of facile good nature
maura guessed an animal-like ferocity
she had tin boxes of delicious-looking
sandwiches a tin of small cakes two
thermos bottles of chocolate fruit and
sweets in her bag and after maura had
refused all of them she sat back and
devoted herself to eating with lady-like
restraint but with vast enjoyment time
after time maura roused with a start
from the doze into which she had drif-
ted  and always the huge eyes rolled
wide-awake and reassuring to meet hers
and the square white teeth shone in a
smile before they resumed the cud-like
chewing and so the hours passed and
maura seemed to wake from a heavier
doze than usual to find chill gray dawn
dragging frosty fingers through the
smoky darkness of the window weari-
ness cold and hopelessness silenced her
it was a dreary world a dreary city a
dreary day and what was to be would
be

  their cab stopped before the door of
a dreary red brick high-stooped house
one of a dreary row in a dreary street
door numbers and window draperies
were all that enabled one to distinguish
between them and then the door of
no  opened to them and mrs
corey who seemed to be awaiting their
arrival became the chief factor in the
hodge-podge of the new experiences

  mrs corey was puffy-eyed from early
rising and shapeless in her dishabille
but she was past middle age and smiling
and she wore a pink-ribboned mob-cap
over whatever hair she had and her lin-
gerie was lacy and white and her
kimono coquettish and she put a wel-
coming arm about the slight lagging
figure of her uncertain guest and
swept her through a cold hall and a cold
front room into a warm snug back par-
lor friendly with broad couch and gay
cushions and puffy chairs and a big gilt
mirror that doubled the dark red walls
and crisp curtains and a gas log in the
old-fashioned grate doing its blue best to
simulate a crackling fire and sending
the tin star

i

out gusts of heat that stirred the faint
pleasant perfume in the air left alone
while this new acquaintance without
doubt discussed her with the black trav-
eling companion maura threw off the
heavy veil took a low chair near the log
and leaned toward the blaze as cold and
lonely humans do instinctively apathy
was heavy on her here was a home-
like room and warmth so far she was
passively grateful and beyond she would
not inquire

  when she heard mrs corey enter
however she stood instantly in the
manner prescribed at school and the
girlish deference and her first sight of
the face that the veil had hidden brought
a crow of delight from that impulsive
lady

  well if you aint just a little girl-
an i thinkin all the time you was a
haughty young person in all that blue
broadcloth an big furs an i can no
more keep from callin you beauty than
i can fly because you are  suppose
im the craziest thing over good looks
that ever was probably because i never
had any of my own you dont want to
mind me for im likely to say anything
that comes into my head but i dont
mean any more harm than a fly but
there youre tired to death aint you
dearie an you shall have a little
somethin to eat an then be put to bed
for a good long sleep i guess ill take
another nap myself sos to be wide
awake when you get up i had my girl
call me because i got your auntys tele-
gram sayin to be on the lookout for you
first train how is your aunty nicely
she an me used to be real good friends
but i aint seen her for years an so
you an shes goin abroad  aint that
elegant an youll marry a duke first
thing you do or ill miss my guess
heres your woman to say good-by

  the very black person was wiping her
mouth hastily on her hand as she en-
tered and an aroma of coffee and ba-
con floated in with her rustling silks
maura put out both hands in sudden
gratitude and a forlorn regret that this
loyal creature was leaving her every-
one seemed to be leaving her

  youve been so good she said

huskily i cant tell you how grate-
ful-

  the woman whipped a clean handker-
chief from her sleeve and put it between
her pudgy brown palm and the white
hand

   taint nothin missy she avowed
her eyes glistening im proud to a-been
called on deed n i am yesm min-
nie shes got my address an if ever you
want me fo anything whatever you aint
only got to sen word fo me to come
yesm i wish yo the best o good luck
missy i certnly do

  and then there was only mrs corey
between herself and loneliness but
mrs corey was as good as a wall

  a comely colored girl appeared with
a laden tray as the black protectress left
and mrs corey fussed happily over ar-
ranging it  a convenient small table

  now youre going to eat like a good
little girl she bade shaking out a snowy
napkin and whisking it across the blue
broadcloth lap heres a nice brown
chop an toast the way i like it-crisp
an brown an buttery-an some mar-
malade an a grapefruit whichever you
like best an a pot of tea i shant let
you have coffee because you got to go to
sleep you look tired dearie but its
becoming to you it sort of makes your
eyes look misty an far away an your
complexion is somethin perfectly grand
aint it whats the use of denyin any-
thing that everyone can see i say an
its natural-anybody could tell that as
i was sayin you got to take a nap an
then well get real well acquainted this

crs but ill make a exception of you o

have a little bit of a room to put you in
but you wont mind because when youre
up you can use this room of mine i
dont keep but one for myself-the front
parlor is genral but im real cozy an
contented an thankful i got this much


the tin star

  her babble was impersonal and sooth-
ing the breakfast delectable the silver
good the china thin the gas-log a flick-
ering comfort maura felt herself re-
lax beginning with unsuspected little
tensions in her body and ending with a
loosening of the innermost fiber of her
will

  exhaustedly after the feeblest of pro-
testations she climbed the stairs after
the colored girl meeting two fresh-look-
ing attractive stenographer-seeming
lodgers on their way out and with the
most casual of glances at her tiny very
bare very clean hall bedroom she let
herself be undressed and tucked into a
sweet-smelling small bed warmly blan-
keted  and she heard her door closed as
though it were extraordinarily far away

  she woke to see mrs corey fuzzily
blonde and flamboyant in a cerise house-
gown smiling down at her

  if you dont look like a great baby
and the plump obviously just-manicured
hand patted the pillow beside the flushed
cheek i been standin here wonderin
whether to wake you up or let you sleep
but youll rest better to-night if you get
up now nobodys in the house but us
so you let me slip this kimono i brought
up right over you an run down teas
ready an youll feel better for a cup
now you do s you are told an take
things easy the way you ought to i
blieve in bein comfortable

  that was her creed and her excuse
was that she had only one life to live
as a philosophy it was as seductive and
as unhygienic as a feather bed but for
a time it served mercifully to pad mauras
bare nerves

  how successfully that result was ac-
complished she discovered for herself in
true feminine fashion

  it was late afternoon of a day of wind
and sleet and snow that she tapped on
the panel of the side-door entrance to the
back parlor and was answered by an ex-
cited  comes quicks you can an help
me to decide before the gilt-framed
old pier-glass stood mrs corey sur-
rounded by square boxes with a milli-
ners name slanting in quarter-inch thick
letters across the tops on her head
was a decidedly jaunty black and white

creation that she was studying with
many prods and shifts and turnings

  i was goin to send up for you i
want to know whether this is too young
lookin she greeted the girl with the
perturbed inflection of hat-choosing time
one of my new lodgers works for this
milliner an i got her to have a few
slight mournin styles sent up for me to
try its somethin sickenin to haf to
stick to black an white because you look
like the old harry in anything else when
youre dyin to wear a color but this
shape has got a lot of shick to it some-
how-if only it aint too young lookin

still i aint got but one life to live-

  maura went into the room a few stiff
steps

  a-spring hat she said blankly
mrs corey missed the tone

  its the wings that makes it look sort
of heavy but i could get a lighter weight
one when it gets warmer an somehow

this just takes my-

  annette the colored girl tapped and
entered with the familiarity of the priv-
ileged servant

genleman to see you mis corey in
the front parlor somepn about the
house-hes from the agents he says
mrs corey pivoted slowly about
from the agents she looked
oddly agitated why-theres two

months more before the lease- and

then putting the hat quickly aside she
caught up her trailing house-dress in
front and hurried out gesturing annette
ahead and closing the door after her
maura crossed to the couch and sat
heavily leaning on a propping arm a
spring hat

  the day after christmas she had come
to mrs coreys and now it was time for
spring hats what of the time be-
tween what had she been doing
thinking all the many days her mind
traveled back bewildered

  chiefly she recalled turkish baths
mrs corey depended on massage to
keep herself in condition and maura
found it fascinating to dawdle away a
day in moving from scrubbing to shower
to plunge and divers rubs to facial
treatments to manicuring to hairdress-
ing to lunching an infinitely lazy lux-
the tin star



uiious round enlivened with social inter-
course of a sort mrs corey adored
safe in the disguise of sheet togas
toweled heads and cream-plastered faces
the habitues mingled with frank curi-
osity and a democratic freedom it oc-
curred to her for the first time that she
had known no other social life than this
mingling with the bars down mati-
nees were another of mrs coreys pas-
sions and there had been many and on
other days aimless tours of the depart-
ment stores tea in any one of a dozen
rooms where there was fair music and
endless opportunity for observing ones
sisters of interesting sorts evenings
had been spent at home mostly at novel
reading without restriction novels that
made one gasp and thrill and flush and
dream and soar and grovel and all the
gaps seemed filled with mrs coreys
curiously entertaining gossip of people
gossip that often seemed like pages taken
from the most realistic of novels and
then there was always a long time de-
voted to meals for mrs corey was
frankly a gormandizer and always the
late retiring and very late rising rarely
she had yielded to her bodys clamor for
air and exercise and had gone for a
walk around the dreary block at dusk
and always she had been glad to get back
to the ruddy room and the reading light
and the new novel and mrs coreys ex-
pansive smile of anticipation as she
carved their chicken or divided the steak
at the small white-clothed table laid for
them before the gas- og nothing wrong
nothing worse than idle and unthinking
had those days been but what about the
future where was aunt claudia

  weekly there came a thick envelope
enclosing a blank sheet folded about one
or two twenty-dollar bills usually the
address was in minnies careful writing
but that had meant nothing because it
was understood that aunt claudia would
be very busy selling her things and set-
tling affairs before the flight to england
maura recalled that she herself had
written once in detail of her surround-
ings as minnie had bade her do but no
reply had come and it had been easy not
to write again because despite the fever-
ish explanations of their last conversa-

tion she and aunt claudia could never
resume that old trying for intimacy that
had marked their relations her face
scorched with a blush as she faced the
fact that money was the one tie that held
her even in thought to the woman she
had called aunt but that she had taken
the continuance of the supply for
granted the yellow bills had been bits
of paper that were the equivalent for
food and shelter and that made possible
the bath and teas and taxis home to say
nothing of the endless small attentions
it had seemed for some reason neces-
sary to show mrs corey and like a
cold trickle through the stir and shame
of her first serious consideration of her
situation crept the consciousness that all
the numerous twenties had melted some-
how and that she had-no spring hat

  a tap on the door brought her up
alertly annette thrust in her head

  heahs a lady to see mis corey an
im bringin her right in heah mis
maura shes a old frien o mis
coreys-yo wont mind will you
mis

  a chinking a rustling and tapping and
an asthmatic wheezing were audible from
the hall slowly a  dark green furred
and feathered bulk propelled itself across
the threshold assisted by the tapping
umbrella and with chinking chatelaine
and a gold vanity bag and a gold lorgnon
coming together in one finishing clash
the enormous bulk subsided with a tre-
mendous thud in a big arm-chair near
the center table

  ill take something for my throat
girl bade a voice that sounded like a
mechanism worn out but oiled to drip-
ping port if its good wheres the
young lady you spoke to i hope im
not intruding my dear- the sen-
tence broke on a wheeze of incredulous
surprise maura stood immovable as
she had risen in her first horror of recog-
nition staring at the bloated pink face
under the two-toned mass of green
plumes the shocked nerves in her face
and scalp began to recover themselves
with an unbearable crawling tingle
this woman was the nancy she had
seen in her aunts dining-room 

  an indescribable choking gurgle of

jan-


the tin star

merriment came from the bulk in the big
chair

   bless and save us if it isnt enough
to scare a body the way i was thinkin of
you again only this day and wonderin
what had become of you and here i take
it into my head to drop in on dolly for a
minute-and run onto you well dearie
howd you come here an how long you
been here you remember me all right
i see itows aunty i kep away from
her for i knew i shouldnt be any help to
her and those detectives pick up the least
scrap o nothin and foller anyone to the
day o their death badgerin em about it
howd you get away so neat without any-
body knowin there was such a person
you neednt be afraid o me-barron only
got what was coinin to him and he was
crazy as bedlam and had been for months
and hed a-had to been shut up if hed
lived the wickedness that man has
done i hate to think of did he scare
you dearie ive wondered and won-
dered what went on and whether he saw
you and how you come out i aint
askin any questions but he made a mis-
take when he kept aggravatin that yeller
minnie the way he did i never whis-
pered it though-

  maura lifted a heavy hand to her
throat where a quick painful throbbing
had seized her between breaths

  what are you-what do you-what

- she stammered but with the first

stab of that pulsation she had guessed
with a creaking of strained corset the
obese creature in the chair leaned toward
her eyes glimmering between their puffy
lids in devouring curiosity

  well upon my soul i believe you
didnt know  and whod a-thought it
claudia said you was as innocent as a
baby but i hardly believed her but you
are  you saw barron didnt you tall
and dark he was but you couldnt hardly
tell whether he was old or young and a
queer habit he had of wettin his lips with
his tongue yes i guess you must have
seen him all right you got a face that
gives things away too easy dearie well
rou cant have looked at a newspaper for
they all of em had it got into his limou-
sine at his own door to be drove to the
station on the evenin of christmas day-

nobody knows where he was goin nor
nothin-and the only way to explain it is
that someone sneaked into the car as it
stood waitin for him an it bein dark the
chauffeur didnt notice anyway when
he pulled up at the station there was bar-
ron leanin back in the corner of the car
dead as a door nail not a sign-nothin
but a little thin sharp knife-dont look
so sick dearie you didnt have no more
to do with it than i did  there was folks
enough that had it in for him but all i
say is he was a fool to make minnie hate
him so he hit her once and she never
forgive him and she had her own crowd
that all stands in together and wouldnt
think any more of puttin a man like bar-
ron out o the way than they would of
eatin of course there was some pri-
vate inquiries-it got found out that he
was very good friends with your aunt
claudia and they pestered her till she
had to move an minnie she kind of
dropped out of sight till things blew
over mind you i dont believe minnie
did it-

  maura stepped back weakly to the
couch and sat her head in her hands
she felt actual nausea so vividly the
horror of that christmas eve came back
to her it was as though the blurred
imprint of the first shock and impression
had been smoothed away so that this sec-
ond shock should stamp itself clear and
permanently on her memory yet in-
stead of the paralysis of the first horror
she felt a gathering of her faculties a
quickening of perception

  my aunt-she is in no danger she
asked not uncovering her eyes she
heard a thickened wheeze that conveyed
a derisive amusement

  claudia always falls on her feet
said the woman with dreadful familiar-
ity no-she aint in danger i dont
want to butt in dearie but ive done
claudia manys the good turn and she
aint never showed a proper gratitude
why dolly here-thats mrs corey-
she sent claudia over to me with a note
askin that i befriend her and what i did
for that girl-its years ago now-i
couldnt begin to tell you and she told
me to my face she hated the sight of me
and wished id never show myself near
the tin star



her again now what do you think of
that and so i dont know as im under
any obligation to hold my tongue when
you ask me a question claudias got
an elegant place a house to herself her
own limousine and three servants and
shes taken off as much as a dozen
pounds and she looks young and bloom-
in its an opportunity that dont come
evry day but claudias lucky and prob-
ably she couldnt take up with this chance
before on account of barron still now
things is all right why dont she have
you back again or to say the least
why aint she told you anything about
her good luck youre too pretty to be
shut up here with dolly i wonder
where that nigger is with my port ive
talked myself hoarse as a crow

  annette came in on that last word
came in with a sudden opening of the
door and a stumbling rush that was
strikingly like an escape rather than an
entrance she had a glass and a de-
canter on a small tray but she sped
across the room from the person for
whom it was intended bent and thrust
the whole under one of the red inner
draperies of the window and then fell
to work on the milliners boxes tying
them neatly and stacking them even
wrapping the favored black and white
turban in its tissue and making an elabor-
ate business of packing it two people
were heard descending the stairs and
mrs coreys voice came breathlessly
thats all the house except my back
parlor-there aint a person here that
dont work evry day in the year excep
the one young lady t had that small
room an is here till she goes abroad
an is the niece of a friend of mine an
will tell you the same an i let her use
my back parlor because its kind of cheer-
ful-seein as its the one room i have
for myself i feel privileged to make it so
because a little comfort is about all there
is left to live for at my age an havin

worked hard all my life-

  she was at the threshold her panting
monologue bringing not the slightest
murmur of response from whoever
strode beside her maura had taken
down her hands at annettes curious
coming in and now sat looking toward

the door but the apprehension and un-
certainty that such an incident would
have brought to her a few weeks back
were replaced by a faint irritation that
aggravated her abiding shame and hurt
beyond enduring she resented mrs
coreys confidences about her resented
the equivocal position in which she found
herself again through no fault of her
own resented the very shame and hurt
that caused resentment and it was an
emotion absolutely new with an impa-
tient toss of her head she stood her
hands shutting involuntarily as mrs
corey trailed in breathing hard flushed
nervously dabbing her perfumed hand-
kerchief at her cheeks and nose and neck
the green plumes of her callers hat
stayed twisted into view around the chair
back in the uncomfortable attitude of ex-
pectancy they had taken at the first words
from the stairs mrs corey started as
she beheld them

  nan-why-how d do  she fumbled
in open consternation when did you
come to town im jest showin the
house to a gentleman from the agents-
some-some repairs i want-

 the gentleman from the agents
stepped deliberately in after her a
small effigy in granite appearing to them
could hardly have been less imperturbable
or more gray from his orderly hair to
his spats he was fleckless most immov-
ably correct and of varying tones of that
depressing color above the white line of
his collar his face was in ashen harmony
with his grayness of hair clothes gloves
and the stony eyes behind the glittering
lenses of a nose-piece the deep lines
in his smooth-shaven finely featured face
seemed grayish carvings the compressed
mouth above his rather heavy chin was
but a slightly warmed variation of the
general hue he was slightly under av-
erage height but of tremendous impres-
siveness  and he was either much younger
than he looked and prematurely aged or
much older than he looked and holding
himself at an apparent fifty-five or so by
an iron determination

  th-this is the back parlor my
room mrs corey repeated feebly but
the gray gentleman had already taken in
the back parlor deliberately with a


the tin star

composure that would have been insolent
beyond words had it not been so coldly
impersonal he appraised the room  fur-
niture rugs puffy cushions knick-
knacks the carefully busy colored girl
and her boxes the green-feathered head
that studied him so intently around the
high back of the big chair and the hu-
mans seemed to mean no more to him
than the furniture one would have
said that he completely missed the slim
frowning defiant young person who
faced him from the couch corner but
suddenly he centered his icy lenses full
upon her and kept them so

  this is the young lady-visitor he
inquired in a voice that was as bleak
as harsh and as expressionless as his
exterior would have led one to ex-
pect

  yes-the one thats goin abroad
mrs corey cringed maura dearie
this gentleman is kind of-kind of taking
a list of lodgers for the agents that lets
these houses theyre gettin more par-
ticlar-though im perfecly willin they
should be far s im concerned but will
you just tell the gentleman about how
you come to be here sos he can see for
himself-

  maura looked not at all at the hunched
fawning anxious pulp that merry mrs
corey had become unflinchingly her
eyes stayed upon the cold gray ones of
the inquisitor and she felt her brows
draw lower and lower in resentment as
uncontrollable as it was foreign to her
what she found most unendurable was
the fact that the man was a gentleman
beyond mistaking an ordinary agents
agent she would have found it possible
to answer curtly and convincingly but
this was the sort of man she had so often
seen at school among the diplomats and
educators and discoverers and endless no-
tables that madame so successfully
cajoled into addressing the young ladies
with her mind on those days she spoke
in a voice that had not the slightest trace
of the caressing languor that her instruc-
tors had found so deplorable

  i do not choose to recognize the au-
thority this-this stranger claims for
himself in any case i should refuse to
submit to such impertinent-

  dearie gasped mrs corey you

dont understan-

  let me explain interposed the ques-
tioner calmly his gaze not leaving the
defiant young face we-the agents
that is-have been advised that in the
interest of morality we should make a
personal inspection of each house on our
lists there must be no discrimination
nothing left to opinion this house for
instance is unsuspected in certain grave

respects-

  well why couldnt youve said so
overcome by relief mrs corey slumped
into a chair cornin cross-questionin
and-

  shut up dolly said the huge woman
in green turning her plumes front as
though she had absorbed all there was
to know of the gray man its up to
them to prove what is not for you to
prove what aint

  but unfortunately went on the
harsh voice as though there had been no
interruption there is an accusation of
another sort from a pitiable source we

learn-

  its a lie whatever you heard and
whoever said it mrs corey shrilled
passionately i aint done a thing and
nobody can prove i have inflamed
with anger loose-lipped evil-eyed the
fat merry harmless mrs corey was
metamorphosed into a creature horribly
like the larger bulk of her caller maura
stared at the revelation with a new un-
easiness and looked back at the gray
man in anxious question he continued
evenly

  it would almost seem that an insidi-
ous influence is at work here to turn

young girls into a mode of life that-

  its a lie a lie a lie screamed the

apoplectic woman he accused you-

  shut up dolly advised the other
woman calmly and mrs corey burst
into unlovely tears the gray man did
not give her a glance

  a mode of life that means death in
life we find that all the lodgers re-
ceived here have been young attractive
and employed at small wages at trying
work the house is clean and orderly
but it has been suggested that it was kept
designedly bare suppose these girls to
the tin star



be friendless of good character unsus-
picious they are naturally lonely they
drift to the one attractive room in the
house where it is made easy for them to

give their confidences and to-

  its a lie bring anyone to face me

if you can-

  i tell you to shut up the fat
woman cut the blubbering- defiance short
youll talk yourself into trouble doll if
you dont watch out

  whatever has been done has been
carefully done the dispassionate voice
admitted but our opinion is based on
our personal interview with a girl of
character beyond the average who gave
her opinion as to the clever causes of her
own downfall further from the report
of a secret investigating committee we
have discovered that among one hundred
unfortunate girls questioned in one dis-
trict twenty-two gave as their last repu-
table address this or some other house
leased in the past by mrs corey it in-
terests us to the point of asking what ar-
rangement mrs corey possibly has and

what percentage she is paid- and

there mrs corey gulped and relaxed in
a seeming faint

  we are justified at any rate in termi-
nating the lease he continued unheed-
ing and the vivid house-gown bulged as
its limp wearer sat up with a jerk and
with such a snarl of vicious rage as made
maura wince

  terminate it then  she shouted with
a foul adjective but ill have the law
on you an well see who makes good
do you think you cn hold me responsi-
ble for evry rattle-headed fool that comes
to lodge with me you cant prove
nothin an i can bring as many to prove
my good name you ask my girl here

if she ever saw-

  shes crooked doll cut in the
woman in the big chair tersely i bet
you she knew this was goin to come off
-she acted mighty funny when she let
me in an she was rubberin at what you
an this man was talkin about an come
runnin in here just ahead of you i
been watchin her this man is sure of
himself better quit

  at the unexpectedness of the accusa-
tion annette stood petrified her face dis-

torted with fear that betrayed guilt
mrs corey after one transfixed stare
howled vindictively and struggled up
from her chair the fat womans um-
brella shot out and prodded her neatly
but painfully back again

  if you wont keep quiet ill make
you  wheezed her adviser let em go
it you should worry you got enough
to live on you fool

  that commented the unmoved gray
man we may well believe we find
that mrs coreys early energies were de-
voted to the management of an establish-
ment the nature of which was unques-
tioned and now young lady if you

are satisfied as to my intention- he

paused and moved a little aside from the
door

  with a rustle of starched apron an-
nette shot forward past him and out
it touched a spring of realization in
maura and she stepped toward him

  nancy mrs corey sprang up with
the cry and spread her arms to bar the
way with a tremendous surge the big
woman got to her feet and faced the gray
man

  none o that she menaced him in
a tone of indescribable vulgarity you
can talk all you please but when it comes
to takin a young lady away with you i
guess the police  have somethin to say
ive seen your kind of a buttinsky before
an sometimes he got hurt because he
wouldnt go away when he was told to
now youve got about a minute-

  she did not say for what she stood
expelling a long wheezing breath of con-
sternation that seemed to drain her of all
her assurance over the cerise shoulder
of mrs corey who twisted about to learn
the cause of the breaking off and the
green shoulder of the silenced one
maura saw that the gray man held a
shining metallic something to his lips

  decide he said curtly whether
youll take the rest of the week to move
in or be put out now there are two plain
clothes men in the basement for just this
emergency your maid let them in after
i entered sit down and be quiet or ill
whistle it doesnt matter to me you
know

  between two cowering stealthily


the tin star

clutching and whispering women maura
moved to the gray man still holding
his whistle in readiness he prodded the
door wide open for her with a thrust of
his silver-topped cane and then she was
in the chilly oil-clothed hall and her
limbs were shaking most surprisingly
and she caught at the banister to steady
herself a hand came under her elbow
from behind and from the front parlor
stepped a man-a pink-cheeked well-
dressed business-like man who removed
his hat at sight of her and looked over
her shoulder to the gray man who sup-
ported her

  stand at this door and keep them in
there-and quiet-till i give the word
the harsh voice ordered matter-of-factly
wheres bray

  here sir maura looked down with
a start for the voice had come from be-
low her quarterway up the basement
stairs standing motionless in the half-
darkness was a man who might have
been the twin of the front parlor man

   tend the front door get an ac-
count of whoever rings snapped the
brief order and now how long will
it take you to pack miss-

  wayne maura supplied mechani-
cally not long i never fully un-
packed

  well make haste wheres the col-
ored girl bray not gone yet send
her to assist this young lady and he
began to pace back and forth along the
narrow passageway from front hall to
back parlor door his cane tap-tapping
the oilcloth in regular accompaniment

  he was making again the turn at the
foot of the stairs when maura started
down pulling on her gloves he stopped
adjusted his glasses and paid her the
compliment of an enigmatical stare that
made her very ears turn hot with a con-
scious blush he seemed to appraise the
outer things of madames choosing at
their precise worth and to probe the
inner depths with perfect understanding
and tolerant contempt with no change
of expression he contrived to show her
that her beauty found him callous and
that he discovered nothing else worthy
of his consideration

  trunk ready fie gave a per-

emptory twitch of his cane toward the
silent pink-cheeked man called bray
ive a cab outside now is there any-
thing to attend to before you leave
mail for instance better leave direc-
tions with this man to be handed to the
carrier about forwarding because it
wont be safe otherwise

  maura went down three of the half
dozen steps between them and stopped
short fumbling with her glove fastening
her eyes searching the adamantine face
imploringly she had expected some-
thing to be suggested expectcd that this
capable impersonal gentleman would
take her out of her present intolerable
situation and arrange another more de-
sirable instead he was asking her for
directions a cab to take her where
mail to be forwarded-where in her
dark blue leather wrist bag with its sil-
ver slides was a single crumpled dollar
bill thrust into one of the silken side
pockets with a wad of theatre programs
and her paper powder book in the small
change purse was perhaps another dol-
lar in silver she had visualized it sharp-
ly when she had been startled by mrs
coreys spring hat and the moneyless
sensation had been a new fright she
felt the fright again now and with it a
dumb hysterical helplessness as though
her thoughts were tortured in a vacuum

 why i- she had to stop and

cough huskily to rid her throat of a queer

rigidity i dont know-where-

and all at once her lips trembled so that
she could not shape them and unsteadi-
ness swept over her from head to foot
she reached for the banister and rested
on it heavily the door of the back par-
lor squeaked open a crack and a strip of
cerise housegown appeared in the oblong

  i got to be allowed to speak croaked
mrs corey that young lady aint got
a friend in the city nor any place to go
and youre layin yourself liable to arrest
if you take her away dearie you stay
here till your auntie comes you can tele-
graph her but then you wait right here
because all that stuff you heard was lies
only i was so struck dumb i couldnt
think what to say and anyway what can
one woman alone do against a put-up
game like that
the tin star



  maura searched the gray mans face
with dilated eyes his expression had
not changed hadnt he understood

  what she says is true she faltered
im quite alone-i dont know anyone
and then as he still waited perhaps
-id better-stay here-just for a
while she added with a sick tremor un-
der the words

  the cold eyes regarding her were like
granite chips under the icy lenses a
faint sardonic twist dragged the corner
of the grim lips slightly

  that of course is for you to decide
he said with obvious impatience there
are several worthy institutions where
you could be received-

  there listen to that shrilled mrs
corey chartable institutions is all
youll get from him you mights well
go to prison an done with it an your
auntll haf to go to law to get you out
again - you stay here dearie-youre of
age an you dos you want to for all o
him you know i aint never done or
said anything but kindness to you dearie
have i  an ill overlook the way you
swallered his yarn if youll come back
now you can telegraph your aunt an
then well have a nice little steak for din-
ner an to-morrer well go to look for
a nice little apartmunt somewheres where
no liesll be told an you an i can jest
take our comfort come on now
dearie

  it was like being shuttled between a
granite wall and a feather bed true
mrs corey had done her no harm and
aunt claudia would be forced to come if
she telegraphed and there was but a sin-
gle dollar crumpled in that expensive
blue bag and then from behind mrs
corey came a stifled wheezing cough
the other woman that unwholesome
creature so like a gross-bodied spider fat-
tened on horrors what was her asso-
ciation with mrs corey and why was
she interested in keeping a penniless girl
with them  goaded by her extremity
her scared wits began to range them-
selves in working order she strove to
speak steadily and to look steadily at the
impenetrable gray man

  i dont want to stay here but i dis-
like-an institution i have been care-

less with my money but more will be
sent me only just now it is necessary
that i get assistance temporarily i have
just recalled that i might perhaps find
someone to vouch for me among the rela-
tives of some of my school friends if
you could tell me or if you would help
me to find a directory i would like to try
them before i-before i go to the place
you suggest you will be paid for what-
ever time or expense you let me cost you
i have a string of very small pearls that
would bring enough to pay you and to
tide me over if you would be good enough
to help me dispose of them but first if
i could find mrs hilford-mrs gage
hilford or mrs courtney scoville-i
met them both when they visited their
daughters at school and perhaps they
would remember me and-and advise me
-for the time-

  yes thats right brag of the swells
you know burst forth mrs corey sud-
denly vicious an tell how you come
to know em an where the money come
from that paid for your schoolin an
wait an see how much use theyll have
for you when they find out who you are
tell em what you know about barron
for instance--

  shut that door ordered the gray
man disgustedly and the pink-cheeked
automaton who had waited his word
thrust back the voluble mrs corey shut
the door in her face and held it shut
unheeding her wrathful tattoo on the
panels

  what is this about the hilfords and
scovilles the interrogation was plain-
ly skeptical but maura was no longer
afraid the curious indignation that this
man had roused in her earlier in the
afternoon was alive again and with it
now seemed to come a self-confidence
that was wonderfully reassuring

  i met both at madame laroches
private school where i have been a pupil
for-for the greater part of my life in
fact it is true that i do not know their
daughters socially but mrs hilford was
always very kind to me and i think that
she would assist me or at least shelter
me for a few hours

  the laroche school repeated the
incredulous gray gentleman his brows


the tin star

puckered evidently he knew of the
place you are prepared of course to
explain to mrs hilford satisfactorily
how you came to be in a place so-er--
decidedly unlike that in which she knew
you the implied suggestion that he
should see to it that she was forced to
explain brought the scorching color to
her cheeks but that irrational anger
mounted within her again sustainingly

  i will explain she answered in a
tone oddly like his own to mrs hil-
ford and she had the satisfaction of
seeing that he started to speak checked
himself and looked at her with a new
keen scrutiny in the instant before he
gestured bray forward

  my coat and help the cabman with
the trunk then you stay here till you
get word from me to leave those wom-
en are not to get out-understand

  yes sir bray opened the door
wide and whistled darted into the front
parlor and came out with a handsome
fur-lined coat which he deftly held for
his superior while a shabby fat-bundled
cab driver waddled up the steps

  through the open door maura saw a
postman run down the steps of the next
house and turn up to theirs sorting let-
ters from the thick pile in his hand she
found herself stumbling down the stairs
her hands outstretched in quaking hope
so eager that she neither understood nor
resented the manner in which bray
stepped between her and the three en-
velopes that the man held out

  oh see if theres one for me-maura
wayne she besought and bray first
looking to the gray man for permission
gave her two letters before he followed
the cabman upstairs

  one envelope was addressed in min-
nies painstaking writing and she tore
it open in excited eagerness that was
made content by the glow of yellow in-
side the folded heavy sheet there
were two bills a twenty and a ten with
her curious anger mounting inexplicably
she opened the second envelope that bore
aunt claudias characteristic heavily
shaded scrawl folded in the note that
she did not give a glance was a yellow
bill-a hundred dollar bill

  she seemed unable to turn swiftly to

face the watching gray gentleman there
is a shock of relief that numbs as ef-
fectually as that of hurt slowly she
pivoted about money and envelopes
crushed in either hand and slowly she
gathered words from the angry flood
of exclamations that seethed within her
defeating themselves

  i have money you see-i need not
trouble you-i shall leave here now if
i may have your cab or i will call an-
other-i knew nothing of what you say
of this house when you saw that and
saw that i wished to get away you should
have done all you could to help me it
doesnt matter whether i had the right
to expect it or not there is a right
deeper than custom but you made me
decide even though you must have seen
that i hadnt strength or experience
enough to decide wisely you would
even have left me here if i had not men-
tioned two names that interested you
you offered me a charitable institution
she mrs corey offered me-kindness
it doesnt matter what lay behind her
kindness she was kind and always has
been and that is why there will always
be lonely ignorant homeless girls who
will prefer mrs coreys sort to your in-
different contemptuous respectability
if you cant be kinder youd better keep
away altogether because if you take away
a girls only home and her only faith
and frighten her without showing her
something better to be gained by listening
to you i believe you  only hurry her
into the very things you say you mean to
help her escape and yet i-i thank you
-for what-you have done and were to
do for me

  the gray gentleman stood civilly at-
tentive throughout eyes  her face
she half thought that she had fancied
the apoplectic flush that had darkened his
changed countenance when she began
because he was so alarmingly gray when
she finished she added her thanks in
half apology of the rudeness that her
over-tensed nerves had inspired she
was not at all prepared for his surprising
reply

  possibly you are right ill try to
change my manner he spoke as cas-
ually as though it was a detail of dress
the tin star

i

he meant to alter if i offended i ask
your pardon it was unintentional really
and i propose that you let me take you
to lodgings that are beyond question
its hardly the thing for you to go to a
hotel you know you may communicate
with mrs hilford or mrs scoville if
you wish you may question the cabman
or a policeman or anyone at all or ill
take you into die nearest bank to have
myself vouched for and then you can
feel secure until your people get to you
only  must ask you to make what haste
you can if i am to accompany you i
have a-rather-pressing engagement

  for the time it took bray and the cab-
man to thud halfway down the stairs
she turned the alternatives over in her
mind never before in her life had she
so weighed any action for herself and
she felt a little thrill of pride as she
found arguments for and against mar-
shaling themselves obediently and log-
ically in her unused mind

  i will go with you thank you she
decided turning on the threshold he
bowed briefly side by side they went
down the steps and courteously he as-
sisted her into the cold dingy cab then
settled himself beside her hands folded
on the cane held upright between his
knees stared straight ahead and seemed
to forget her maura glad of his silence
looked unseeingly out the gray smudgy
window where the sleet clicked accom-
paniment to her swift thoughts she was
trying to become acquainted with her-
self-her new self something had hap-
pened to her in the incongruously impor-
tant moment when she was shocked by
mrs coreys spring hat dimly she per-
ceived that in that instant had been com-
pleted the awakening begun in madame
laroches rose-hued boudoir on the de-
cember afternoon so short and so long
a time ago then she had submitted to
being shown truth now she knew her-
self to be seeking it

  the cab stopped with a skidding lurch
then swayed as their driver clambered
hastily down the sputter of a racing
engine just ahead stopped abruptly in
the pale radiance of a street light a tall
great-coated figure showed gigantic as it
stooped to peer in at the window of their

cab the gray gentleman thrust his cane
toward the glass without moving his
body and rapped the silver head on the
pane at once the door was jerked open

  i say the cab seemed instantly
flooded with deep warm voice and faint
blending of gasoline and lilac toilet wa-
ter as the intruding leather cap was
brushed off by the low door and the
aroma of recent cigarettes contending
with cold fresh out-of-doors just got
your note what the deuce-oh i beg
pardon

  the unknowns head with its reminis-
cence of lilac and radiation of electric
health and warmth had literally brushed
mauras huge fur shoulder piece as he
craned in across her it was instantly
withdrawn with a jerk that rapped it
agonizingly against the swinging door
and brought a tempery grunt from the
impetuous one

  attend to me rasped the gray gen-
tleman ignoring the awkwardness take
this young lady-ring the bell-have
mrs dockham come out here to me
and you come with her make haste
he did not turn his head but stayed
rigidly facing front under his harsh-
ness sounded a quickening that one
might with certainty have called the
hurrying note of great pain with diffi-
culty mastered and of fear defiantly
faced

  what-is anything the matter
maura ventured alarmed he did not
turn

  get out-quickly please go with
this-this young man-its just across
the sidewalk ill attend to the driver
quickly please

  startled and concerned she sprang
out the young man taking her elbow to
help her to the slippery curb without
a look at her he leaned past her into the
cab and she thought she heard a groan
from the gray man at once the un-
known turned ran across the sidewalk
and up the steps of a house that might
have been the double of mrs coreys
dreary brick abode and rang the old-
fashioned pull bell violently then he sped
back down the steps and up to her
breathing fast

  i take it youre to go in here his


the tin star

deep hurried voice was abrupt but not
unkind just let me help you to the
steps the walk is icy the woman will
be out directly no doubt the door
opened as they reached the foot of the
stone flight and a slatternly maid peered
down at them holding her blue checked
apron aside from the limp white one it
shielded

 send mrs dockham out quickly
please mr faris wishes to speak with
her and hes not well make haste this
young lady is to stay here i believe

  he looked down at maura for the first
time as he gave her an involuntary slight
thrust toward the steps and she looked
up at him with a murmured thank
you the light from the hall above was
full on her face his was in shadow un-
der the cap he had resumed the cap
moved quickly as he thrust his head for-
ward in a second involuntary movement
and he stared at her so close that she
caught the gleam of his eyes under the
blackness of the visor and saw an in-
dian lean cheek and jaw outlined as
clearly as though a pencil of light had
followed their curves ruddily

 who wants me-mr faris the
light was blotted out the outlines dis-
appeared the unknown started with an
ejaculation under his breath

  yes please can you come out to the
cab mrs dockham

  the tall black figure looming in the
doorway sighed prodigiously and sniffed
maura was to learn that mrs dockham
always met requests of whatever nature
in that fashion

  yes i guess mebbe i wont get cold
ill just get a shawl the light streamed
out again as she moved aside to a hall
stand

  are you to live here demanded the
deep voice low and rapidly

  i dont know i suppose i am for a
little maura heard herself answering
with infantile candor and simplicity and
the new maura wayne sprang defensive-
ly to the rescue for a very little that
is only a day or two in fact and she
marveled at her own change of tone and
the ease with which she managed it
i do hope that mr-faris you call
him-is not seriously ill if youll thank

him for me again and i thank you also
perhaps id better go in now if youll
be so good as to send the man along with
my trunk thank you again

  she turned quickly up the steps and
saw from the corner of her eye that the
visored cap was lifted deferentially she
yearned to look back and see what sort
of face would be revealed with the full
light on it but she would not and the
mere fact that self-control had occurred
to her gave her a fighting sort of joy
that triumphed heartlessly over the
babyish regret that her denial cost her
her self-knowledge was intoxicating in
the sense of freedom and capability it
conferred the fact that this departure
had been of her own will and that the
shabby smelly lukewarm and half-
lighted hall in which she found herself
was beyond all mistaking the hall of
an everyday honest uncomfortably re-
spectable house weighed heavily for self-
respect and under all was the subcon-
scious support of the three yellow bills
tucked into the inner pocket of her wrist
bag

  mrs dockham came up the steps with
a sigh and a shiver and a sniff and
turned curiously to inspect the new
lodger who waited with her back to the
door long lean lachrymose black-
haired black-gowned mrs dockham was
as unmistakably respectable-and in
much the same way-as her house

  mr faris says youd like a room as
transient she said listlessly i dunnos
what i gots good enough-its third floor
back and the heat dont get up there real
good and it needs paperin but i aint
felt i could afford it and while i in-
tend to give good clean food and that
thats nourishin now that livin is so
high i cant brag of the table i blieve
in tellin the truth beforehand instead of
bein drove to it

  it was a wise precaution evidently
with whatever chill of disappointment
her dreary third-back struck its pros-
pective tenant there could be no denial
of the fact that mrs dockham had told
the truth about it-beforehand but it
would do would do very nicely maura
assured her with brave disregard of the
brown tattered walls the sparse rickety
the tin star



furnishings and the damp stale-cookery-
tainted air because the thought that it
was only a transient arrangement inter-
posed a merciful haze between her eyes
and actuality dinner though in a base-
ment dining-room crowded with all the
people who had peeped from doors and
stared  landings and whisked past her
in the dim halls was an ordeal she de-
cided to evade

  i must get several things-stationery
ink some toilet things she explained
hoping she spoke casually so ill just
get something to eat at the nearest res-
taurant when i go out now mrs dock-
ham looked at her quickly with eyes like
blackberries dropped on dough

 we-ell- she hesitated you

want your key now or will you ring
when you get back

  ill ring and not till many minutes
later did it occur to maura that the gray
mr paris might have warned the wom-
an that it would be well to have an eye
on her transients comings and goings
with a fresh accession of independence
she turned in at the first restaurant she
came upon in her seeking a white-tiled
dairy lunch place where her independ-
ence was augmented by having a table to
herself and a passable little steak served
her such as she guessed would have
meant bankruptcy to mrs dockham at
a periodical shop she bought paper ink
pen and stamps and a daily paper com-
petent self-supporting women she knew
read their daily paper as customarily as
did men and she had determined to be
a competent self-supporting woman

 she enjoyed the slatternly maids
obvious excitement at letting her in and
greeted mrs dockham with cool under-
standing when that cautious person ap-
peared at the third back almost immedi-
ately with two towels and a door key
indeed the new maura wayne showed a
bewildering grasp of motives and affairs
the old maura wayne who lingered
parasitically trembled and feared and
admired this sudden evolution of her-
self

 it was the new maura wayne who
wrote briefly and pointedly to aunt clau-
dia announcing her intention to be self-
supporting and disclosing the discovery

of mrs coreys character with a chill-
ing absence of comment or reproach that
made the rest of the communication con-
vincing but it was the old maura
wayne who drifted into a silly revery
standing before the foggy cracked look-
ing-glass of the bureau ridiculously she
recalled a hint of lilac and cigarettes
the vibration of a deep voice the rough
brushing of an unknowns head against
the fur over her breast the ruddy line
of light on a firm jaw and a lean cheek
that showed young and firm and fresh
above the leathern collar are you to
live here he had asked

 the new maura wayne brushed the
foolish remembering aside and yawned
defiantly at the flower-fair image in the
depths of the battered mirror it had
been an incident an unwise incident
she was a self-supporting woman and a
transient and the old maura wayne
would always be a fool

v

  the blotches of black and white that
were so trying to look at and so disturb-
ing to listen to gradually settled them-
selves into the image and likeness of
aunt claudia bending over the bed and
crying hysterically and to arrive at
that conclusion the protesting body and
brain labored to exhaustion and were
submerged in sleep that was oblivion
nevertheless it was not so difficult to
understand the second appearing of the
black and white noisy effect and by the
sixth time it occurred to the sluggish
brain to wonder why it hadnt recog-
nized aunt claudia at first and why she
was so eternally crying it took some
hours to answer that self-imposed ques-
tion aunt claudia was gone and ach-
ing daylight was gone and a soft glow
from the hall light sifted through the
ground glass transom into the quiet dark
room and the nice one had taken off her
rustly starchy white things and sat be-
side the bed in a lazy-swaying rocking
chair wearing her warm woolly bath-
robe and patting mauras hand with a
comforting touch

  i have been sick maura made her
brain direct her lips but the lips didnt


the tin star

answer because between the two the
slimpsy little thread of voice lost itself
after a tiny panic at the failure she
tried again and tried so hard that the
s in sick came out with a whispering
hiss instantly the nice one bent over
her close

  hello-asking questions and the
comforting hand big and soft and cool
smoothed away the ache that was be-
ginning to torture mauras forehead
stubbornly maura tried to shape her
sentence again and succeeded with the
s it was characteristic of the nice
one that she understood-always under-
stood

  yes youve been sick dearie and
youre in a private hospital and there
isnt one single bit of a thing to worry
about and ive been with you all the
while and shall stay with you anything
else

  there was a question that aunt clau-
dias tears suggested and after a long
hard try one word of the question came
die

  no sir answered the nice one em-
phatically i guess you know me well
enough to believe what i tell you youre
getting well and its going to be like
traveling up hill and stubbing your toes
all the way but things are going to be
interesting for all that if you make a
good climb of it for instance way
up in new hampshire ive got a whole
pen full of buff wyandotte hens fat
sociable ducky comfortable biddies the
color of wheat fields after the wheat is
cut and the sun has warmed the stubble
and theres one particular hen who lays
her eggs in the nest nearest the hen coop
door in a little sweet hollow scooped
out of dried clover and ive sent up
word that the eggs from that nest are
to be snuggled up in new white tissue
paper and sent along to you by parcel
post every other day think of having
a crispy piece of toast and a new laid
egg and think of that fine fat hen thats
going to be told to lay them for you
bet a cooky youll dream exactly how
she looks

  it was ridiculous probably but it was
agreeable not to think of its being ridic-
ulous and there was something rest-

ful and sleepy and comforting in think-
ing about the new flampshire hen the
first brown egg standing warm and snug
in its little glass cup alongside a crisp
square of hot toast was so familiar and
homey that the weak tears sprinkled all
over it but it tasted so very good that
it was impossible to think of anything
else for all the hours between that and
the next meal except how the next egg
would taste and besides eggs there were
chops and steaks and chickens and salads
and ice-creams and all the delectable
things if the nice one would only exert
herself a little to get them but the
nice one only laughed and doled out her
tantalizing bits and when she laughed
and dabbled a thermometer in a glass
of water and gave orders about keeping
her patients mouth closed and called
maura a silly baby for whimpering be-
cause there were ten million aches
crowded into one brittle body-then she
didnt seem so through and through
familiar as she did at the cozy dusk
times in that clear-headed interval be-
tween the fretful afternoon nap and
the splendid rub before the long night
nap

  ive been away from school a dread-
ful while maura whispered petulantly
on a day when the uphill climb had
brought the fever creeping back again a
bit

  oh no not so very long the nice
one reassured her but that nagging
question of time once roused wouldnt
be stilled she went back to it again
in the nice hour when the comforting
hand patted her helpless one and there
was no noise and no unbearable light to
confuse her thoughts

  it seems a good while anyway and
madame hasnt been here and no
flowers from the girls even-aunt
claudia-hasnt been here-for a-
while ive had-the-queerest dreams
-about-being-somewhere-

  mercy me why i had one dream
in an hour about a month ago that
seemed to have filled a year the brisk
voice took up the thread her weary one
dropped and when the nice one told
a bedtime story it was sure to be all full
of new flampshire hills and hens and
the tin star



apple trees and blue sky and spring winds
and fascinating trifles nevertheless
next day the nagging question began
again and all through the dusk hour
the queer dreams that came back so
vividly knit themselves slowly slowly
into a fabric that seemed real

  there came a day when the nice one
came in smiling over a broiled squab
and then there was a scrap of broiled
steak and a wee chop and dabs of sher-
bet and frozen cream and day by day
as the heavy sleepiness lifted a little
the slow knitting of dreams filled the
hours

 the nice one fresh and rustly in
clean white with her homely clean face
pink and lovable under the nonsensical
crispy little cap was called out to the
hall one sunshiny afternoon and she put
the glass of water she was carrying down
on the chiffonier while she answered the
soft tap an air current bulged the low-
ered window shade and a prying sun-
beam shot in struck the unsteady water
and instantly a pool of aching quivering
light was reflected on the ceiling over the
white bed on the supersensitive closed
lids of the beds occupant the unusual
light acted as an irritant she stirred
frowned and sighed herself partly
awake a voice from the hall caught
her dull ear a mans voice unused to
modulation harsher and more per-
emptory than the voice of any of the
taciturn physicians or quiet internes she
found herself wider awake than she had
been for a long time

     and as i shall be here daily on
this account ill be available whenever
you think it wise for me to see her
she does not remember yet-you are
sure 

  perfectly sure answrered the nice
ones low accustomed murmur and
after the briefest of adieus she came
in noiselessly and met the stare of fear-
darkened terribly intent eyes that
burned in a delicate face too small for
them

 and the nice one smiled as she
came trying not to hurry toward the
bed her hand casually brushed the
emergency bell and pressed it but she
kept on smiling

  tell me-tell me how long ive been
here maura stammered fighting for
the words through a fog that surged
red-tinged before her eyes and through
her brain

  six weeks lie still as you can
kiddy and trust me you heard that
man speak outside the door didnt you 

  yes i-yes yes i cant tell-who
he is-but i know-i remember-
nurse

  yes all right all right-dont hurry
-take your time-

  i must-hurry-i tell you-they
havent been dreams they havent
there was a room with brown paper
and mice in the walls-and a woman who
sniffled and queer people-and i sang-
sang for a man-but it was a cabaret
show he wanted me for and i got fright-
ened and he swore at me-and after that
-the employment agency sign wasnt
a dream i went there-there was a
gray man who told me to go-and that
sick woman who made me read to her
all night and whose little dog ran away
from me when i took him out and the
crowds in the street and the agency
again and the time-the time-nurse
make me stop remembering make me
stop-

  a white-jacketed interne came in
quietly holding the slight figure close
keeping it down with one strong arm
while her free hand unhurriedly
smoothed the hot forehead the nurse
nodded to him and spoke gently

  dont be afraid of remembering-i
know all about it every bit the brown-
papered room was in a lodging house
and there were mice in the walls of
course  and the cabaret show was enough
to scare anyone-nasty smoky drinky
place and the gray man was mr faris
and youll remember him presently it
was he who spoke outside the door just
now and he gave you a note of intro-
duction to the woman in charge of an
employment agency of the upper class
and she gave you a beastly job with a
peppery tempered invalid  and her nasty
dog got away from you and you had
words and then there was another place
with that society suffrage woman who
sent you out to sell papers for the cause
 

the tin star

  and ought to be ashamed of herself and
the crowds scared you and you had a
bit of trouble with the woman at the
agency over another place-

  yes but-oh nurse how long-how
long ago was it i cant remember
time all i can remember is christmas
and a little boy like a cupid and some-
thing hideous that happened just be-
fore-

  the interne came up behind the nurse
and held out an hypodermic syringe that
he had been calmly and carefully filling
she nodded and began to slide her free
hand down the writhing white shoulder
and along the arm that twisted to loose
itself from her restraining clasp

  not far out of the way honey she
said cheerily only i guess its christ-
mas a year ago that youre thinking of
you been talking of it and of a little
hoy i guess thats the one and never
you mind what happened before that be-
cause nothing is going to happen this
time it was the very first of spring that
you went to the room with the brown
paper wasnt it thats what mr faris
told me and the summer was pretty hot
you drank some made-over milk at some
place or other and got your germ right
there and afterward you kept about
too long its winter now-youll wake
up to-morrow and find a holly wreath
in your window because to-morrow
is the day before christmas - and
something nice will happen on christmas
eve-

  with a tortured gasp the frail body
sprang a few inches from her unpre-
pared arm-and dropped back again
limply

  ah commented the interne skilfully
nipping the hypodermic from the fingers
that would have let it fall now i won-
der is that good or bad tough luck it
had to break on her this way whatever
it was shes apt to have that particu-
larly devilish paralysis or lose her
speech or pop off altogether beauty
too what  a reg-lar peach whats
old faris-

  get out of here you puppy yapped
the nurse most unprofessionally and
as he was a very young interne and she
an established favorite he went

vi

  aunt claudias sables were thrown in
an enticing heap on the trunk that served
maura for clothes chest general reposi-
tory and center table and one of the
soft brown tails that dangled by way of
trimming from the costly shoulder scarf
lay within a sixteenth of an inch of a
melting pat of orange-colored butter that
had slid from a scorched soggy piece of
toast on a chipped soup plate that held
also a dab of hash and a baked potato
skin maura had been lunching when her
aunt arrived and had reached from her
chair by the window and put the heavy
plate on the trunk just before the furs
had been flung upon it from that chair
by the window it was possible to reach
also the edge of the single couch bed
the bureau was only three steps beyond
the trunk and the door only four steps
beyond the bureau for a person so
weakened by illness that walking was al-
most an impossibility this top floor hall
bedroom at mrs dockhams was con-
venient  but there was little else that one
could in honesty say in its favor

  some long-ago person with money to
waste and a passjon for cheerfulness had
papered the walls red time and the
morning sun and many tenants had
changed the color to a pinkish drab
splashed with grease gouged patched
tack-holed with squares and oblongs of
such hues as never were on land or sea
where calendars and photographs and
what not had occupied spaces and hin-
dered the fading process for varying
lengths of time the couch bed was
covered with a one-time portiere of one-
time green faded to yellowish-olive dingi-
ness  a wispy sagging sash curtain of
cheese cloth intervened mercifully be-
tween the boxlike dimensions and the
one outlook upon the blank brick side-
wall of the next house and a second
similar curtain hung dejectedly across a
corner opposite the door was intended
to counterfeit a closet the one chair at
the window was a splint porch rocker
one leg spliced with pieces of wood un-
skilfully nailed on and was without
cushions the pillow from the bed had
been utilized as a back support and a fold-
ed gray blanket covered the broken seat
the tin star



  propped with one shapely chiffon-
swathed arm aunt claudia sat as she
had slumped on the springless bed on
entering and stared dumbly at every-
thing from the gray ceiling to the strip
of straw matting on the unpainted floor
and to the scrap of orange-dyed butter
that menaced her sables suddenly she
sat upright but without a move to rescue
that adornment and stripped off her
gloves as though she were about to set
to work at something briskly but as her
sombre dark eyes flashed to her nieces
face half defiantly they were met by a
smile of complete understanding and
placid impassivity that for some reason
checked the activity abruptly the quick
red suffused aunt claudias handsome
but a trifle over-full face and she twist-
ed the gloves into a soft rope between
her white fingers

  from her infinitely chic advance-sea-
son hat to her superlatively modish
shoes she was in her favorite black but
black of evident costliness and of a
knowingness of cut and fabric throat
and shoulders glimmered marble white
through dusky chiffon overlaid with
hand embroideries like the miraculously
perfect shadows of delicate vines and
leaves pinned to her corsage and
drooping carelessly through the bruising
lapels of her coat were four uncannily
beautiful orchids ivory lemon-streaked
with scarlet splotches of one hue with
the lovely mouth that pressed alluring-
ly against the mesh of the lace veil
aunt claudias mouth was perhaps her
best feature

 from head to foot maura appraised
her relative with the all-comprehending
but friendly slight smile on her own paler
lips and aunt claudia stared back half
fond and half furious taking in every
detail of the slight figure in the splint
chair the shining silver-fair hair that
swept about the small head in an almost
too massive braid  the oval face thinned
and almost translucent in its pallor the
frail hands lying idly on the comfortable
brown steamer rug laid over the relaxed
limbs and incongruity was the chief
thing the dark eyes noted the incon-
gruity of that delicate beauty in that
dreadful room the incongruity of the

carefully dressed hair brushed and tend-
ed as surely those feeble hands could
not have managed the immaculate ruffles
of a muslin dressing jacket frilling crisp-
ly out at neck and sleeves of the cheap
red flannelette bathrobe and the snowy
handkerchief tucked into the small
pocket all bespoke plentiful launder-
ing and frequent changing and the man-
icuring of the idle hands that most cer-
tainly would have taxed their slight
strength beyond endurance on the bat-
tered window sill were piled six new
novels with a delicate ivory paper cutter
atop as many late magazines a silver-
papered box that could contain only ex-
pensive bonbons and on the floor be-
side the newspaper-covered soap box that
served as foot rest was a basket of
violets a large shallow pretentiously
rustic basket heaped with effectively
careless masses of single exquisite blos-
soms on a bed of their own green leaves
up-pouring their adorable fragrance
the money represented by that costly
february offering and by the trifles on
the window sill would have refurnished
and repapered the room

  by a fractions quirk mauras faint
smile grew satirical

  flowers and candy and books and
fruit are allowable gifts for a young man
to make she observed mildly as though
she were answering an objection the
paper-cutter isnt proper of course but
i let it go because its so much easier
to use than a hairpin on these stiff leaves
and the luxury wouldnt be so noticeable
if the room werent so dreadful i keep
the violets down in that corner because
its dusky and they dont swear so at the
awful color of the place when it gets
dark ill put them up on the trunk and
enjoy them

  aunt claudia had flushed and paled
and flushed again and she spoke low
and slowly as though she were trying to
keep herself in hand

  how long have you been in this hall
bedroom and who-if i may ask-is
the young man

  the second question is the one you
want answered first isnt it maura
countered he is ivan barrison and
he is something or other to the gray man


the tin star

mr faris whom you have met i saw
him-barrison that is-the day mr
faris brought me here from mrs co-
reys but only for an instant he called
here next day and sent up his card but
i wouldnt see him i had no reason
i just thought id be suspicious for a
change and twice afterward i refused
and then i got work and he didnt know
where i was the afternoon of the day
before christmas he was brought to the
hospital where mr faris had had me
taken mr barrison had been in an
upset-his car had skidded-and he was
badly hurt the first day that nurse
took me in my wheel-chair to the sun
parlor we passed his door and he was
looking out and from his chair recog-
nized me and later we met in the sun
parlor and since ive been back he has
sent things every day but i havent seen
him sarah-thats sarah webb my
nurse-says hes of an old and enor-
mously wealthy family thats all i
know except that i like him and he has
been kind to me i was moved up here
last week its cheaper and the charity
board that mr faris interested in me
only allows me a very small sum please
dont offer me money though because
we had that out before i left the hos-
pital and anyway i like this better than
the brown mousy room on the third
floor mrs dockham gives me lunch-
eon sarah webb comes every after-
noon late and bathes me and brushes and
manicures me and brings me all sorts of
good things to eat that the rich hospital
patients send back and she makes me a
thermos bottle full of chocolate that
stays hot for my breakfast and i cook
eggs from her new hampshire hens
over my gas she does it because she
likes me and i like her oh yes and
she takes my things to the hospital laun-
dry and thats how i come to be so spick
and frilly thats all about me aunt
claudia

  aunt claudia had twisted the gloves to
a leather wisp that dented her flesh her
mouth looked weary

  maura i cant-cant stand it she
said laboredly i know ive forfeited
all claim but i-maura my food
chokes me knowing that you havent

enough everything i possess curses
me havent you made me pay almost
enough to square what you suffered
through me remember that i didnt
mean for you to suffer or to know al-
ways-from the very first-i planned
that you should be educated in fashion
to fit you to go back and win over your
fathers people i decided on madame
laroches school because i read that it
was the one school in america that fitted
young girls to enter continental society
and on the strength of your english
connections she took you all i dreamed
of was to be near you and to know that
you were contented and safe some day
in england where nobody knew of me
and where i could be-be respectable-
and forget-my life here thats the
truth i havent been all-not all to
blame maura

  the straight brows drew down over
the cool amber eyes and for a flash there
was a marked resemblance between the
girl and the woman then the look dis-
appeared in a slight smile

  lets not go over that again aunt
claudia the trouble with you and me is
that we lived on vague to-morrows so
long that we lost our to-days entirely
you have confessed that my fathers
people dont want me i suppose that if
i went to them and sat on their steps-
if i could get so near to an english es-
tate as the steps-theyd come out and
yank me into the house and keep me in
an upper back room and feed me occa-
sionally just because one tiny trickle of
their blood is in my veins but the vital
current of me is american and it
wouldnt submit to such patronizing so
thats why you sent me to madame la-
roche was it just to fit me to win
my way into their good graces poor
aunt claudia if madame laroche
had only taught me one single way to
earn a living but thats one thing that
was never referred to in that ridiculous
-dear-old place madame makes her
living in america by making american
girls as unlike their ancestors as is pos-
sible and the polish that she imparts
needs to be rubbed up almost incessant-
ly with-money

  aunt claudias slim foot tap-tapped
the tin star



short-temperedly on the matting there
was money enough to do that in the be-
ginning she said half sullenly your
fathers family sent him enough-sent
him what his share of the inheritance
would have been and more thats one
thing that your madame laroclie
stickled for knowing where the money
came from and i told her your fathers
people had settled it on him and she
wrote to england and found out it was
so what she didnt find out was that it
had been thrown to the four winds
within two years of the time your father
got it it was madness he and your
mother were children and pampered
themselves like children instead of tak-
ing the interest of his securities he real-
ized on them and spent the money in
traveling in wild investments that were
to bring him fabulous wealth and on
his eternal gambling he would bet on
anything and thousands went on the
races he kept a stable even in a small
way-and he was the sort of man who
must have his valet how it would
have been had he lived to see the end
of his resources i dont know but you
were born and your mother died in giv-
ing you birth i told you that he died
soon after so he did but with the
loss of her and the failure of all his pet
schemes and the crookedness of some
of his american and canadian friends
who hoodwinked him into ruinous in-
vestments he lost courage and-shot
himself i can show you the newspaper
accounts of it they lay great stress on
his distinguished ancestry i suppose
the accounts reached his family and were
one more disgrace for which they blame
america and the woman he married
but thats the truth of it he shot him-
self

  slowly maura lifted her thin right
hand and slipped it inside the red bath-
robe at the breast her fingers seemed
to close firmly on something there
that was-hard on you she said with
a weary wistfulness i didnt know-
things were quite so bad for you my
only excuse is that i really had nothing
to do with being born or with being left
to you aunt claudia is there-anything
else that you havent told me any-

   jan-

thing i should know id like to know
-the truth

  she had grown a trifle whiter but eyes
and lips were steady it was aunt clau-
dia who flushed and showed resentment
as she understood

  what are you thinking everything
ive told you hasnt been a lie-it was
a legal marriage if thats what youre
worrying about if it hadnt been do
you think your fathers people would
have let it pass so easily theyd have
come here and taken him back by force
i believe thats another price im pay-
ing for having staked everything on your
english ancestry you take it for grant-
ed that youre to be ashamed of the other
side ill have you know that your
mother and i came of good stock your
grandfather-your mothers father and
mine-was a minister as was his father
before him he was a hard man-nar-
row-minded bigoted cruelly stern-but
a good man and a just man according
to his light he married a ministers
daughter he had a queer snobbish no-
tion of class in holiness and yet ive
always believed that mother would have
been a gay almost a frivolous creature if
she hadnt been so crushed and subdued
by father ive always thought that
lottie-your mother-and i were the ex-
pression of all her inner rebellion and
desire there was a boy the first child
who died then your mother and a
prettier thing than lottie was as a girl
i never saw she was all golden where
im dark and your eyes are like hers and
you sing a little as she did but hers was
a stronger voice and might have made
her famous a wealthy eccentric old
maid in fathers congregation insisted
that lottie be sent to the best conserva-
tory in new england to have her voice
trained for solo singing in the choir
father didnt dare refuse i suppose but
at any rate she was sent and for a year
we heard wonderful things of her one
night a half dozen conservatory girls
went on in the chorus of an opera they
volunteered to do it for the fun of it and
the thrill of it and the experience and
to watch the stars methods and lottie
went with them i fancy it was the first
wicked thing she ever did in her life


the tin star

for father had scared her as success-
fully as he had scared mother almost
and he gave her a whipping for crying
for a set of furs two weeks before she
left for the conservatory oh he
whipped us yes-he was a hard man
your father had landed in new york the
day before and was going through to
canada where the digby younger broth-
er had taken a tract fie with some
friends had a box that night ite saw
lottie of all the people on the stage he
saw her and yet people say that such
things dont happen well he was at
the stage door not rude nor assured-
just forceful and determined if he had
stuck to other things as he stuck to his
whims hed have been a wonderful man 
the doorkeeper interfered and told the
young men who those particular girls
were and at that he gave lottie his
card and asked her name and she was
so frightened and so excited that she
told him next day he called at the con-
servatory and asked her to whom he
should introduce himself so that he might
meet her properly it wasnt a sordid
flirtation your father was a gentleman
though not a very good man according
to orthodox notions he didnt go to
canada they were married in three
days after he had cabled his people and
been warned to go on and lottie
brought him home telegraphing ahead
and father met them at the door and
cursed her and cursed her husband and
shut them out and crossed the registry
of her birth from the bible she had
married a stranger in three days and it
was the work of the devil according to
father and i cried and he struck me
woman grown that i was i got out the
shed door that night with some things in
a bag and walked four miles to the next
village where there was a fairly good
hotel i guessed id find lottie there and
so i did  and she and i cried together
while your father walked the floor and
growled and they both told me that i
should stay with them forever and for
two years they dressed me prettily and
took me about and amused themselves
with me and made life a heaven on earth
for me poor little country girl that i
was she had drifted from her first

resentment to a reminiscent tone and
her face softened and saddened showed
its kinship with the younger face against
the pillow in the splint chair it was
a look she shrugged off with a short im-
patient sigh at the futility of remember-
ing

  the rest isnt pretty you had been
put in an expensive private nursery
everything that lionel wayne did was
expensive i couldnt do any better than
let you stay there and i thought some-
thing would turn up to make things as
they had been there was some money
left-he left it to me and a small very
small income from certain stocks that
he supposed would do for us both but
i lived along doing nothing save wear
my pretty things and read novels and
going to play with you at visiting hours
and planning what id do when i got
to it i was only twenty and one day
they sent for me to call at the bank my
account was overdrawn they were de-
cent and took securities enough to cover
them and i came here to new york to
look up some of the effusive people i
had met in the prosperous two years i
was put off and put off and shifted about
and snubbed and most of the men tried
to make love to me and all the while i
was eating up the income that belonged
to you i got a position at a glove count-
er in a department store and one of the
girls there told me of mrs coreys-
how clean and inexpensive it was i
went there i took her cheapest room
it was a room much like this only
clean and bare but there was a cozy
back parlor and a welcome and sympathy
whenever i needed it i used to con-
fess how discouraged i was in six
months i was so discouraged that she
sent me on the pretext that a friend of
hers would find me a place as companion
to the fat woman you saw when you
came home from school more than a
year ago and nancy finished what
mrs corey had begun

  she sat a moment staring at space
with wide vacant eyes as though her
vision were turned inward and she saw
the past again but all at once she started
and flushed as though a spoken word
had stung her back to reality
the tin star



  as god is my witness maura i
thought youd be safe there at coreys
you believe that dont you i thought
she had changed and it was only the
girls without friends or money who
were in danger at any time im not
beginning to excuse myself-im just
human enough though to want to have
the credit of my decency i-id rather
you died than to have you-as i am
and yet the curse of it is that i cant
change theres no going back for me
theres no going back for any woman
unless shes strong enough to make a
new life and a new self out of the
patches of the old self and live down
public opinion ive known women who
tried it one who went to the other side
of the world to begin over again and
someone there wrote to a friend here in
america and had the friend look the
woman up they spent money and time
just to run a suspicion into its hole and
bring it out to damn one poor woman
and the laziness and luxury have eaten
away any fibre i ever had if i had
followed you to coreys and started to
england as we had arranged wed have
been poor if your people hadnt taken
us up it would have meant starvation
in a year because youre not fitted to
earn a living nor am i and just then
i was tempted again more money than
i had ever had and a real affection-
i believe though not an honorable one
of course i dont expect that i knew
you were bitter against me and i-well
i did as i have always done i did the
easiest thing trying to persuade myself
that it was only to get money enough to
make our venture safer when we finally
should go because i didnt dare have
you with me i meant to take you away
from coreys in another week and try to
get you back with madame laroche
but i was so upset over the-the thing
that happened to the man who caused
all the trouble for us that i was dazed
for weeks and couldnt plan couldnt
think the detectives were spying on
me constantly for two months and i
used to give money to the negro eleva-
tor boy who was minnies nephew and
have him get it to her by stealth so
that she could mail it to you because

my mail was watched and i didnt want
them to know even of your existence
and then came your letter it nearly
killed me but i deserved it and after
that came that gray man faris and told
me not to send you money but to let you
work out your own salvation he half
threatened to make trouble for me if i
refused and so i had to submit and
the next i heard was that your life was
despaired of do you envy me-would
anybody envy me my ease and my pretty
clothes knowing what my life is and has
been 

   she choked back a sob of self-pity and
despair her eyes imploring but the jet
and amber eyes of the girl stayed soberly
intent and cold it was a composure so
unnatural that it brought its own bewil-
derment

   deep inside me i feel all youve told
me aunt claudia but its like water
trickling under thick ice i cant show
you that its there i cant even feel it
all through me i seem not to mind
any more whether things are good or
bad the fair head drooped against
the pillow with a relaxation infinitely
hopeless there was a day in the hos-
pital that i remembered too fast and
felt too horribly much and it nearly
killed me nurse webb saved my life
but i havent much beside life it seems
to me no heart no tears no laughs no
caring i sit here and let things go as
they will perhaps when i gain strength
everything will come back and i shall be
normal but things happened too fast i
learned too much of life all of a sudden
i think now all i ask is to sit here a
while and not be asked to think or to do
anything im really not unhappy
sarah keeps me nice and clean-

  sarah the tight rolled gloves
swished violently against the dingy
couch cover in a stroke of released irri-
tation im having hard work not to
hate your sarah even though she did
save your life why is it youll take
from her and not from me i cant
stand it any longer to be put aside so
i want you to let me find a room for
you near me ill be perfectly honest
and tell you that i wont risk taking you
to my-to my home youre the sort that


the tin star

attracts men without meaning to i
begin to see why madame laroche got
those grown-up clothes for you before
that christmas vacation it was to show
me how your body had developed to
wake me up to the fact of the danger
she saw for you i tried not to see it
tried to believe it wasnt so but you-
know what happened youre a little
girl soul in a beautiful woman body and
youre of my blood partly and my blood
isnt of the enduring sort what can
you do youve found out a little bit
of what youre up against and youre
right enough in saying that school didnt
teach you anything that will enable you
to meet this sort of life be sensible
child let me take care of you till
youre strong let me have you taught
anything you will take up your music
again-youve a voice worth cultivating
give in a little now so that you may not
give way completely-some day i-
im afraid of this barrison man and
maura-i-i care for you youre all
i have let me take you back with me
to-morrow dear

  she had stirred the unnatural com-
posure at last the clear eyes clouded
and the hand inside the red bathrobe at
the breast seemed to fumble at some-
thing nervously

  oh i dont know what to do-it
seems like giving up too easily and
youve told me what comes from giving
up if id only been taught something
useful-

  a thudding rap on the panels of the
thin door started them both aunt
claudia got up hastily and opened it a
slatternly girl with a blue kitchen apron
caught aside to show a limp white one
thrust forward a box and a card

  flowers fr miss wayne an genle-
man says d like to see r fr minute if
shes receivin callers she rattled as
though it were a formula to which she
was accustomed

  aunt claudia openly read the card
before she turned her cheeks showed
very red under the lace mesh across
them and her lips seemed thinned a bit

  mr barrison she said and waited

  thank mr barrison and tell him i
am not seeing anyone maggie maura

spoke that sentence as though it were a
formula also and as she closed the
door aunt claudia looked over her
shoulder with a nervous shaky sound
that was neither laugh nor sob it was
comprehension and it was protest and
it was something more it said as
plainly as words whats the use
sooner or later-and lets be comrades
and go the broad way together if it is
coming to that only dont try to de-
ceive me but aloud she said  shall
i open the box

  thank you-yes please and with
the cloud gone from her eyes maura
watched the white unsteady fingers
work at the silk tape there were lilies-
of-tlie-valley-a great sheaf of them--
under the sea-green tissue and the cool
firm exquisitely sweet sprays pressed
like tiny-bodied messengers from a far
world of peace and innocence against the
pale face that bent to them aunt
claudia unfastened her pearl veil pin
got out her powder papers and leaned
toward the smear of cracked mirror that
hung over the trunk her lips were
trembling her eyes misty with tears her
face flushed  but despite the reality of
her grief she seemed more like a child
denied its whim than a woman horror-
struck at the abyss before a loved one

  ive never-never had any affection
-that i wanted-in all my life she
said brokenly if i had i might have
done differently but all i can say is
that if you ever need me and ever find
out that your sarah and your everybody
else gets tired of doing for you ill
come and in the meantime youve got
ten dollars a week coming to you from
now on-

  ive got-what a white radiance
from the flowers seemed to shine in the
face turned to her swiftly ten dol-
lars 

  yes ten dollars your own money
thats the income i told you about-it
just about paid for the infant food they
fed you and afterward i forgot all
about it except that it went to you-i
told madame it was a pin money allow-
ance i had the brokers make a list and
i sent it on to this mr faris and they
had to let me come and tell you about it
the tin star



if you think im lying as you probably
do ask him the check will come from
the brokers monthly thank god you
neednt take any more from charity and
itll give you enough to keep you from
starving as for me ill go back to
new england and try to forget that i
was ever fool enough to hope that any-
thing good could come into my life ive
got a heart trouble thatll kill me before
many years and im glad of it minnie
used to have to give me narcotics night
after night i guess minnie is the only
human being that cares for me and i
cant have her with me for fear theyll
arrest her for murder and i suppose
my father would say i was getting just
what i deserved and would get worse
hereafter well im going i caught
the midnight train last night from bos-
ton just to make one last try and any-
way to give you your money and im
going back feeling i shant see you again
ever and with this barrison man to

worry about- she caught her

breath aggrievedly half waiting for a
denial none came without a vestige
of resentment or confusion in her face
maura sat looking at the lilies in her lap
her expression somehow conveying that
she had heard but that the hurt of the
words was lost in the deep brooding that
went beneath the noise of speech to the
spirit that actuated it

  to the woman whose life had been an
evasion of brooding that abstraction
was more baffling than any words
there came to her sharply a memory
of the beautiful laughing silly shallow
girl in whom she had felt the admiring
pride and ownership of one who has
helped a butterfly from its cocoon
youth seemed the only link between that
memory and this too quiet white moth
that had usurped the poor butterflys
body the splendid promising lines of
that body seemed shrunken by more
than illness the thinned face seemed to
possess an unearthly patience and purity
and the ineffaceable youth made the un-
natural calm pathetic aunt claudia
perceived all at once that this was a
child taking flowers for love of flowers
without a thought of the givers intent
that the worldly wisdom and the dis-

concerting composure were defenses that
the girl had instinctively put on fash-
ioned from the very evils that had as-
sailed her with a pitying shamed sob
she knelt beside the splint chair flinging
her arms about the listless figure

  dearie dearie-aunts poor baby i
didnt mean to scold i didnt mean that
i believed youd do anything wrong
but im jealous i want you to let me
take you away from all these folks that
have come into your life and take care
of you maura listen dear ive tried
to improve myself so you wouldnt be
ashamed of me when we went to eng-
land ive tried to read good things and
to speak better and not to-not to
swear and ive cut out drinking and
ive stopped taking things to make me
sleep and ive paid more attention to
walking and to what i ate  sound like
a fool but im trying to make you un-
derstand that youre the only living thing
ive got to make me want to break away
from the life im leading youre not
going to take away the only hope ive
got are you  it would give me some
self-respect if i knew my money was
doing some good in the world and id
save and wed go away-if we didnt go
to england we could go somewhere-

  mauras smile stopped her short it
was the smile of calm comprehension
that had disconcerted her at first the
smile of wisdom sick of its self knowl-
edge

  we wouldnt do it aunt claudia
for you and me theres no breaking
away some day theres just a stopping
short to-day thats the only thing ive
decided on and you cant change me
somehow at something i must go on
from this new sort of life i have chosen
if i go back-im not being superior and
virtuous im just-afraid i guess i
sit here and dream of a bathroom with
silver faucets and linen and crystal and
meals served by a crispy-capped maid
and oysters and rare duck and steaks and
plenty of whipped cream on the choco-
late and a glittery-keyed piano to play
on afterward with big bowls of roses
dropping leaves every time i crash a
chord i dream things even to the mon-
ograms on my lingerie and then i cry


the tin star

sometimes over the mess mrs dock-
ham brings me and pity myself because
im such a fool that i wont let myself
have what you offer me it would be so
easy to go back so easy to do every-
thing except to stop thinking thats
the answer after all ive begun to
think i began about a year ago when
i found mrs corey trying on a spring
hat i woke up to the fact that my
pretty nice lazy body was mastering
me just as madame laroche warned
me that it would if i didnt take care
i never told you what she said to me
because  was ashamed and i didnt be-
lieve it cither but she was right my
nlouth and my eyes used to ask to be
loved and my voice used to coax and
my body used to promise and while i
was innocent i wasnt ignorant alto-
gether theres a difference and
madame told me that the choice between
the rulership of my body or my soul lay
with me and with none other and yet
it was a spring hat that shocked me into
knowing how insidious that rule of the
lazy body could be and then i grew
angry with myself and ive never
stopped being angry i wont give in to
it again because its too easy and no
human being has any real deep down
love for anything or anybody thats too
easy the other way is hard but its
interesting if i end behind a counter
and have to call this room home to the
end of my days still it will be more in-
teresting than the other way and i
thank the fortune that ive found that
much out

  aunt claudia got to her feet stumb-
ling a little over the clinging folds of her
black skirt she turned to the mirror
wiped her face off carefully with a pow-
der paper threw the scented pellet into
which she rolled it on the tray and
quickly caught her sables away from the
threatening butter as though she saw
that danger for the first time it was a
curious thing that her silence made one
know that she was keeping back hysteri-
cal noisy weeping the room seemed so
tense with that repression that mauras
next words came half apologetically as
though she feared to let the storm loose
and yet was constrained to continue

  youre not to think that i mean to
abandon you aunt claudia its only
that i must take the way i know to be
my salvation wont you-couldnt you
come here with me you could furnish

a room to suit yourself and- she

shrank from mentioning the money
much or little that might have accumu-
lated-my ten dollars will do wonders
till the right work turns up she
ended aunt claudia tied the costly
veil pinned the fullness neatly close to
the nape of her neck with the pearl
pin and smoothed it over her cheeks
and chin with the universal gesture of
women

  ten dollars she said looking at
herself in the smudgy glass i spent
that this morning for hairpinsand
she tried to laugh but her voice shook
so that the sound was a mirthless qua-
ver the failure seemed to goad her to
an unbearable sense of her grievance for
she flashed about hands clenched face
flaming rage making her tremulous
from head to foot you talk to me of
saving your soul she cried if i
hadnt sold my body for you youd have
had no such problem im thinking it
is my shame that kept you alive my
shame that put cleverness enough into
your empty little head to make you able
to talk to me the way you have let me
tell you this that its the decency ive
tried for that has brought me all the
misery ive known and im done trying
when youve been a fool long enough
on your ten dollars a week come back
to me and hold your tongue and take
the silver-fitted bath and the crystal and
linen and maids and music that my
shame can give you my shame indeed 
if i had waited and been lucky enough
to have sold myself with a little formal-
ity thered be no talk of shame if a
red-nosed politician that had delivered a
hundred votes for the privilege of call-
ing himself justice of the peace had
grunted a few words over the bargain
that would have rendered it decent
would it if some little white-livered
mercenary mumbling half-man who was
afraid to work with his hands and chose
to make his living from scared women
and church fairs had only snuffled a
the tin star



benediction over the bargain that would
have made it sacred would it i might
have taken a dozen lovers then and
have hated the man who owned me as
a dog hates a brutal master-yet the
magic three letters that my master per-
mitted me to place before his name
would have made the whole thing usual
and right and acceptable in the sight of
creation as it is ive been honest
ive been true absolutely to the man
who purchased me ive filled my bar-
gain which is what your good wives
dont do ive given him a comfortable
home i havent nagged i havent
whined when i was sick or neglected
him for bridge whist and matinees or
other men and ive treated him as an
independent being i had to of course
if i had married him i wouldnt have
had to thats one mighty big reason
why a woman likes to be respectable it
gives her the privilege of being as lazy
and disagreeable as she chooses and the
man will stand a heap of it before he
leaves and yet have to pay her alimony
enough so that she can keep on being
lazy and disagreeable damn such de-
cency ill take my chances with such
women before the almighty but just
the same it hurts to have a little snip
like you sit in judgment on me what
right have you to say whats good and
whats bad you fool of a baby thats
never been tried 

 i-i dont honestly i dont
weariness and nervousness made the
answer come with a gasp that might
have been fright ive never once said
what was right for you its only whats
right for me that im deciding youve
got to decide whats right for you and
we may both be wrong but neither of
us will have to pay for the others mis-
take and if you-if you loved-

 oh aunt claudia flung up her
clenched hands and snapped them open
palms out as though she surrendered
her last hope so thats it thats the
maggot at the root of all this twaddle
youre nothing but a fool girl moping
over that fool idea eh she let her
hands fall and laughed laughed with-
out the quaver but also without mirth
and turned and caught up her sables

i might have known well it makes
me feel easier a little to find youre the
same sort of human that i am youre
just a different type of fool thats all
and remember that im not the sort to
sneer or to look satisfied or to twit you
with whats past if ever you come to
me and admit youve been a fool ill
just be glad to see you kiss me good-
by you pretty pretty little idiot
youll find love all right with that face
-god help you 

  under her acrid laugh the quaver
of tears shrook again she pressed
her veiled lips quickly to the white
forehead caught up her gloves and
 rushed out slamming the door behind
her

  maura set her teeth in her lower lip
and held the lilies to her face her eyes
squeezed shut to keep back the admis-
sion of tears somehow when she
opened her eyes and let the tears have
their way it was almost impossible to
stop them if there had been a dim
soft-hued graciously beautiful room to
look upon through the dreary rain it
might have helped but tears in mrs
dockhams hall bedroom merely made
the ugly colors clash and jumble and
the dreadful furniture seem twisted and
distorted and insensibly one drifted into
crying because things were so hideous
and on that basis one could weep indefi-
nitely

  someone rapped so unexpectedly and
peremptorily that it brought a husky
come from maura as she started

  ivan barrison opened the door

  there was every reason why ivan
barrison shouldnt have done such a
thing so many reasons in fact that
one could have played the old game
alphabet with repetitions to itemize
them all he shouldnt have come with
an a because it was audacious and ag-
gressive and awkward and many other
as he shouldnt have come with a b
because it was bold and boorish and
brazen-and because  the principal c
reason was that it was compromising
and so on to the is when indiscreet
and improper and impudent would sug-
gest themselves as truthful and appli-
cable and all these were reasons that


the tin star

maura had told herself and had acted
upon and every one of them was for-
gotten instantly and completely at the
bodily presence of him

  there is no explaining this tremen-
dous argument of personality

  he stood  the threshold auto cap
under his arm drawing off his motor
gauntlets slowly as though he intended
to come entirely in and to stay and
leaning forward in her chair she stared
at him both of them quite ignoring the
conventions of greeting

  when they had reclined languid and
convalescent in wheel chairs side by
side in the hospital sun-room she had
found herself studying under her lashes
the indian-lean cheek and chin that she
had seen outlined in warm light from
mrs dockhams door that momentous
day of her waking just how photo-
graphically that memory had stayed with
her she hadnt known till she saw the
reality again and it was satisfying to
discover how exactly as she would have
had them the lines were completed the
lean cheek merged into a reassuring
forehead with a well-set ear and a nose
slightly greek slightly aquiline and pre-
dominantly american the mouth was
generous-lipped but firmly closed a
mouth that one felt might lend itself
over-easily to talking back but never to
any lie under mans size and never at
all to vulgarity his eyes corroborated
the mouth deep-set deep gray black-
lashed and pupiled with a glint that
would be equally ardent for merriment
or aggression as it chanced in those
days only a patch of brown hair had
showed above his ears and at his left
temple the rest had been covered by
a turban-like bandage made necessary
by his scalp wounds now she saw that
his hair was a thick brown thatch lus-
trous and alive brushed straight back
circled with a dark glossy rim where his
cap had pressed now the word and
the fact of the present brought conster-
nation with it

 why-what-how did you- she
began dismayed

  he stuffed the gloves and cap into his
great-coat pockets and came further into
the room half closing the door behind

him and smiling at her the uneven com-
radely bad-boyish smile that had never
failed to welcome the wheeling up of her
chair beside his

  i found it was getting a habit with me
to come here every day leave flowers be
dismissed go away and grouch he ex-
plained casually and habits are evil
things so i came back and gave the maid
two dollars to help me get rid of this
one his parted lips changed suddenly
from smiling to the strained look of a
man who had run himself breathless and
parched three strides and he was be-
side her looming over her a queer pallor
under the tan and glow of cold out-of-
doors on his face child do you
know how long it has been since ive
seen you

  it has been-some time she ad-
mitted letting herself back slowly to
the support of her pillow it was gro-
tesque that at that instant she should
want to cry because she hadnt been able
to eat her luncheon if there had been
anything tolerable beside one small baked
potato she thought aggrievedly she
wouldnt feel so fluttery and floaty and
ridiculous

 it has been- there he stopped

so abruptly that she looked up into his
face quickly and to her ineffable relief
he smiled the familiar smile he unbut-
toned his coat threw it back a little and
sat down on a corner of the newspaper-
covered soap-box foot-stool few hu-
mans could have looked into his eyes
crinkled at the comers with whimsical
good humor and at the uneven line of
wholesome white teeth shown by his
comradely grin and doubted his decency
even though the spirit of devil-may-care
flicked every line and lurked under the
twinkle

  me he complained i graduated
from the turban to a victors wreath
effect in a linen band about my temples
and i had myself wheeled in proud as
a prize baby and waited for your chair
to come alongside stead of that came
your nurse to tell me that you wished
her to say good-by for you only by
great self-control was t able to keep
from saying things to her after you
and i had gossiped all the way back
the tin star



from the pearly gates was that a nice
thing to do

  she smiled as she hadnt since those
gossipy days all she was able to think
of was how good it was to see him again
as bracing as a northwest wind he was
and apparently no more mysterious his
coming had been bad-boyish revolt that
his presence made her understand he
of all the world was the one soul who
roused the play spirit in her made her
feel that some day she should run in
great windy spaces and laugh gloriously
at nothing and be riotously glad of life

  what ive got to know is whether
you didnt want to see me or whether it
just happened so he persisted and the
crinkled eyes narrowed to intensity
she stirred uneasily she decidedly
didnt want him intense

  id better tell you exactly how it was
when i was taken ill here mrs dock-
ham sent for your friend mr faris
and they seemed to think my illness of
a dangerous sort and he had me taken
to that private hospital where we met
again his impulse was of the kindest
but when i suspected the costliness of
it and made my nurse tell me i simply
couldnt let him go on paying the bills
as he was i knew i couldnt dream of
paying him back at that rate and i got
so fevered that nurse webb made them
bring me back here she comes to do
for me like the square and solid angel
that she is

  i dont like a pucker between your
eyes was his only comment and she
roused to her worried frown and smiled
it away again he nodded thats
better now since i skidded and
cracked my head i manage a car as re-
spectfully as even the traffic regulations
could wish me to do and ill take along
anyone you say your nurse or the maid
of the two aprons who knows me so
well here or the landlady who snuffles
only youre coming soon and repeat-
edly arent you

  oh sometime perhaps-thank you
she frowned again if only he would
be boyish and inconsequent and not force
her to think of the future nor even of
his present offending just now i
want you to talk to me of things out-

doors and people and anything that oc-
curs to you and in fifteen minutes you
must go and you must never do this
again

  he grimaced

  there couldnt be greater incentive
to a cheery entertaining chat but my
dangerous inclination to please besets
me he leaned back clasping his
knees with his hands and looked at her
with an expression that she couldnt un-
derstand  but even as she wondered he
smiled again whimsically its sloppy
outdoors and an east wind going even
the prettiest girls are using their hankys
and theres no drastic change in the
modes so america-or this part of it-
is uninteresting suppose we go to italy
for a little trip it would set you up
amazingly

  fie could talk while they two
blinked through the sunbath hours he
had droned to her droll observations of
the patients and of themselves and crea-
tion generally and in those hours she
forgot absolutely all the unbelievable
things she had remembered too soon
and words could give him no greater
compliment now he set himself delib-
erately to entertain her and after her
first marveling at his uncanny faculty of
understanding the sort of things she
would like and the manner in which she
would like them she gave herself over
contentedly to being diverted in a
suite de luxe of the hugest steamship
afloat she idled across the ocean in such
luxurious fashion as a fairytale queen
might have accomplished and then
without effort they drifted through the
warm blue and emerald land of her de-
sire as though they possessed the magi-
cally flying carpet of legend glimpsing
quaint and comic and tragic bits in their
passing reliving bits of the mighty past
of rome fared happily through its en-
chanted venice tramped in high spirits
its lesser known byways of the colorful
present ate daintily in palaces and
shared the black bread and cheese and
sour wine of the peasants sailed its
azure bay mounted to the brink of its
infernal crater stood in the peaceful
dove-wooed solitude of a convent garden
on hills above the misty olive groves-


the tin star

  someone thudded up mrs dockhams
stairs scratching matches on the land-
ings and setting a blue glimmer of gas
alive

 what-why where have i-

maura came forward in her chair clutch-
ing the arms through the stealthy gray
dusk that still thrilled with a low voice
and was fogged with visions she could
just make out ivan barrisons eyes gleam-
ing in a pallid blur that was his face and
the white line of his collar above the
black bulk of his coat that he could
have made her forget his presence so
completely was a terrifying thing where
was her worldly wisdom acquired
through horror and agony where was
her self-possession her foreknowledge
of dangers within and without she
had yielded like the veriest simpleton to
this first innocent-seeming temptation
utterly forgotten the menacing suspi-
cions of the earlier afternoon

  oh for pitys sake go she burst
out beating her hand down upon the
lilies he lunged and caught the frantic
fingers hard

 what is it what startled you

yes of course ill go but what-

  oh i cant explain you mustnt ask
ive remembered-something-that i
thought i should never forget you
shouldnt have come here you shouldnt
have forced yourself here that is i
dont mean to be ungracious and i was
to blame quite as much as you but go

now-go-please- her breathless

appeal rose to an hysterical whimper
he stood quickly and bent over her

  child be quiet im going at once
but this nervousness wont do is it the
dark that frightened you because the
dark comes early did you say that
your nurse is coming

  yes-she should be here now shell
tend to everything i know i seem ner-
vous and queer but i-cant tell you
please go

  yes-now but remember this  im
going to see you again make up your
mind to that because ive got to see

you- he bent his head and crushed

his lips against the hand he held for
an instant she forgot everything in a
giddy drop back to the moment when his

head had brushed past her as she sat in
the cab with the gray man on that mo-
mentous day of her breaking away from
the old order of things now again she
felt that pleasurable sense of half con-
tact with youth and warmth and virility
and caught the wraith of lilac scent his
lips burned her palm good night lit-
tle girl good night-maura and the
room seemed vast in the tingling empti-
ness that engulfed her

  far below the front door crashed
and after an instant the draft puffed in
on her presently it came again as the
first to return among the lodgers opened
it in the lengthy listlessness of a tired
homecoming then the draft was al-
most a steady breeze as a bevy of the
department store girls dawdled in keep-
ing the street door ajar while they sorted
the mail on the hall stand weary steps
and quick middle-aged steps and
lighter younger treads sounded on the
thin-carpeted stairs and in and out the
rooms and snatches of their babble
came up to her at least they kept each
other company in their barren respect-
able existence at mrs dockhams

  sarah webb had never been so late
before suppose she wasnt coming
there would come a night soon when
she wouldnt come and life without
sarah webb seemed ridiculously un-
thinkable a smell of savory stew be-
gan to creep up from the basement
trickling through the stale cold of the
halls it wouldnt taste as well as it
smelled for mrs dockham was not a
good cook but it would be hot and com-
forting the scent of her lilies grew
unbearably heavy and she brushed them
from her lap ivan barrison and even
the pulsating spot on her palm grew as
unreal as any of her fevered half-wak-
ing dreams and he would never come
again because she mustnt let him and
she was hungry trembling with hunger
she stretched from her chair and
grasped the cold scorched toast but
the first mouthful nauseated her and she
flung it back it was something hot that
she craved to check the cold that was
numbing her something hot and easily
swallowed because there was an almost
unpassable constriction in her throat
the tin star



in her temples a muffled hammer began
to beat slowly compressing the slow
blood agonizingly in her head the
wavering hall gas began to flicker mon-
strously before her half-closed eyes and
she seemed to be swinging in sickening
fashion to and fro in a gigantic arc
and her fear of so many things
seemed to dwindle to a little girls fear
of the dark and of loneliness and pain

 footsteps among the many began
unmistakably to climb the stairs to her
door she held her breath sarah
webb usually came briskly but these
steps were slow and accompanied by a
curious bumping and clinking but then
came a cheery familiar voice

  the clover-nest hen was late in lay-
ing but im here

 and then with a wail and a rush
came the tears

vii

 like an unmanageable anchor dan-
gling from a balloon the body trails and
bumps and drags along under the aspir-
ing flights of the soul hindering mis-
directing catching at last in some stub-
born obstacle and forcing a descent to
earth the prejudice against cutting
loose seems however to be founded on
an instinct divinely implanted that it
takes mighty desperation to ignore in-
deed the faith that enables one joyously
to anticipate a final flight without incum-
brance and with no downdrag is called
religion and the equanimity with
which one in its meantime submits to
the haulings down to earth is philoso-

p h

  these two essentials are possessed in
varying degree by every human those
who deny either or both are destined for
a flight or a bump that will deprive them
of all ideas save the ones they con-
tradict

  so since there is  permissible way
of cutting loose before the allotted time
the part of wisdom is to humor the nui-
sance instead of letting it drag one to a
smash a very little will coax the fool-
ish thing along after all a soft cloth
wrung out in cold water is a blessed re-
lief to tear-blinded eyes even though

the tears spring from the very travail of
ones spirit a woolly blanket tucked
close and warm about a shivery mortal
bulwarked with pillows on a couch will
soothe and lessen the rending and tear-
ing of bedeviled nerves a little hot
chicken broth forced between quivering
lips and teeth that bite and click on the
spoon in spasms of sobbing will some-
how magic away the demons of grief
and if by great good luck theres a sen-
sible soul in another body to sit along-
side and pet a little and scold a little
after rendering these services and pat
ones shoulder tenderly and understand-
ingly there comes quiet and blessed
peace and a foolish weak wish that cry-
ing didnt upset one so

 by such means did maura emerge
from the chaos of her collapse and look
up in damp gratitude to her benefactor

  poor old-nice one she apolo-
gized shakily i didnt-mean to
nobody but an idiot would tear
themselves to pieces that way on pur-
pose sarah webb accepted the apology
but itll do you good youve been too
perfect and patient ever since you got
back here anything happen

  aunt claudias been here for one

thing-

 huh if theres more than one
tiling lets wait till after dinner ive
got the whole evening fleres a clean
hanky ill just turn your pillow and
then put this infernal mess of luncheon
outside the door some day ill tell
that dockham woman that piety begins
with p like pots and pans and other
everyday things to bring you

hash-

  sarah webb was vigorous that sug-
gests that she was not refined but it
emphatically does not mean that she was
coarse vigorous is the word vigorous
of speech and body action thought
emotion and honesty naturally it was
a vigor frequently tinged with impa-
tience because it is a world in which a
vigorous person will find many causes
for impatience vigor of thought ac-
tion and honesty not being the conven-
tional lures sarah webb had remained
unsought and save for a brief period
of romantic curiosity at sixteen had
o

the tin star

wasted no thoughts on possible senti-
mental experiences it is hardly neces-
sary to add that she was not and never
had been pretty in her mellowed mid-
dle-age she was more attractive than she
had been as a square sandy too pink
too quick-tongued girl her square-
ness was overlaid with ample curves her
ruddiness enhanced an effect of prodi-
gious cleanliness her quick tongue
adapted itself to the pointed brevity de-
manded by surgeons and her strength
sanity and honesty combined with an
amazing native intelligence had won her
a high place in her profession

  only the convenient phrase law of
opposites could explain the attraction
between such a woman and maura
wayne but it is certain that they liked
each other hugely supplemented each
other mentally and disagreed amicably-
friendship asks no more

  with aching eyes half closed maura
lay and contentedly watched the deft-
ness with which sarah put things
straight banished the soup plate put the
lilies in water to revive and covered the
trunk with a white towel over newspapers
to serve as a base for culinary opera-
tions it seemed that the whims of pam-
pered convalescents had afforded more
than was customary for her dinner be-
cause the preparations were extensive
sarah untied many strings and handled
many parcels something big and glit-
tering appeared on the trunk and a cir-
cular blue flame sprang alive at the
touch of a match maura felt only mild
curiosity sarahs resources were so
surprising that it was not profitable to
continue to question them

  we got a chafing dish she asked
in placid acceptance

  ive got one sarah corrected terse-
ly she lifted the shining cover and
dropped into the pan something that
sputtered and smelled delicious maura
sniffed

  sarah what would happen to you if
you thieved from the hospital larder
and besides you solemnly promised you
wouldnt spend money-

  havent where one word sufficed
sarah never wasted two she stooped
to the corner and rose stooped and rose

darted at the chafing dish and turned
what was cooking stooped to the corner
again maura dimly recalled the bump-
ing and clinking that she had heard on
the arrival and had forgotten in hys-
teria there was a glorious new sputter
and new fragrance and sarah began to
chink silver and a plate maura sat up
feebly absorbed in the unusual proce-
dure sarah turned whipped a napkin
across the blanketed lap and after a
flurry of final seasoning turned in re-
pressed triumph revealing her mystery
there was a light lacquered tray bear-
ing thin gold-banded china and sparkling
silver knife fork and spoons a hissing
brown miracle on the plate a salad mir-
acle beside it

  its all so sarah gave grave assur-
ance and you eat with your mouth
you know not with your eyes

  maura wayne ate heartily after-
ward propped on her elbow she
skimmed whipped cream from hot choco-
late and watched sarah webb eat a
share of melting berries there had
been a full quart when the last crim-
son globe had been dipped in powdered
sugar she put her deferred question as
succinctly as sarah herself would have
compressed it

  going to tell me

  with an imperturbed nod sarah put
her plate aside and began to unlink the
cuffs of her tailored shirtwaist in
street attire she copied the stronger sex
to the point of strong-mindedness only
in her uniform with the surplice folds
of her handkerchief crossed on her deep
bosom and the crispy white cap topping
her sandy soft hair did she reveal her
woman side

  while i was about it i got a dish-
pan she said unexpectedly every-
thing else most packed into it very
nicely and i made the delicatessen
people scald and scour the chafing dish
and spirit lamp and china so i could use
it at once when i got here

  sarah what are you-

  let me tell it in my own way that
young barrison met me as i was com-
ing in at my usual time and-

  sarah

  with vigorous jerks nurse webb
the tin star



twitched one sleeve and then the other
up to her pink elbows then placed her
hands on her knees and glowered

  ever since i was sixteen ive been
at work paying off mortgages on that
new hampshire farm she began
sternly first one that father left
and from then on one after another that
i put on to educate the boys this
present one seems to be the last and
then i guess ill begin to save money to
put up a temple to commonsense
there isnt any anywhere and it wont
have to be a very big one because there
wont many people want to use it and
it would relieve my feelings a lot that
whippersnapper that never did a days
work in his life wanted to give you a
few dollars worth of sensible help in-
stead of a good many dollars worth of
cut flowers and folderol he was walk-
ing the pavement when i came up and
he grabbed me look here nurse said
he that girl is sitting up there in that
cussed hole with a dab of cold hash and
a piece of burned toast on a soup plate
and shes thin as a match but i should
be outraging all the gods of convention
if i sent her porterhouse steak instead
of violets but i can offer it to you
cant i and youve got sense enough
to take it havent you for gods sake
whats money for and i said well
hurry up and get that car of yours to
going and get me where they sell meat
that aint embalmed and why didnt you
think of it before and i got a chafing
dish and an alcohol kettle so you can set it
on the trunk corner and make yourself
malted milk and he picked out an in-
valid set of china and silver  a tray
and then we went to a provision store
and to a delicatessen shop and left a per-
manent order at a certified milk place
for a quart of milk and a pint of cream
a day to be left here all in my name
if it shocks you to death just console
yourself with he notion that the gifts fil-
ter through me and all the indecency is
strained out of em and only the good
comes to you now instead of wasting
all the strength of that steak in thinking
up reasons why you shouldnt have
eaten it lie down and cultivate the seeds
of reason voull find in my remarks

while i go get some hot water to wash
these dishes

  when she came back maura lay flat
staring up at the ceiling her cheeks very
pink she did not speak when the
clearing away was finished sarah webb
pulled the rocking chair under the wall
gas jet and set down to work at the
making of irish crochet-an occupa-
tion that served as a diversion for many
silent watching hours and incidentally
brought in extra dollars to clear away
the succession of mortgages suddenly
maura spoke

  he didnt seem to notice the room or
anything

  decent commented sarah webb
silence again till the next confidence
aunt claudia wants me to go back
with her she says im her one hold on
self-respect and that at least i should
accept her money while im fitting my-
self for work she thinks it my duty

i suppose-

  i never heard of getting anyone
out of a hole by jumping in with em
said sarah webb better drop a rope
in to em and pull

  but what if i cant pull maura
asked uncertainly in other words
she says im too weak to keep-to keep
-good alone she couldnt to be
sure it was for my sake and she says
my mother was weak good blood
enough sarah on both sides but no
iron in it mother married father
three days after she met him and she
didnt meet him-properly and he
when things went to smash and he lost
her shot himself and so i-you
see-

  sarah webb faced about to the couch
bed

  dont start on yourself till youve fin-
ished with your ancestors she snapped

  you say heredity to me and ill
swear and im against profanity too
that heredity business is as bad as rivet-
ing shackles and handcuffs and a pack
on a child before you teach it to walk
but as far as that goes-look here did
your aunt have to put you in a school
where the tuition was enough to support
a family on wasnt she strong and
well and didnt she owe your parents


the tin star

gratitude and money enough so she
should have gone into the country where
living was cheap and take care of you
herself for pitys sake wheres your
commonsense  and take your father
a good-looking young chap hectored to
death all his life probably by talk of
titles and propriety and what he should
and shouldnt do lie gets away from it
and sees a girl he loves she loves him
and from what your aunt told me of
your mother she was a pretty little
thing nagged to death an artist soul
born into a new england puritan par-
sonage i think they did nobly to wait
three days i think they were of splen-
did calibre to remember to get married
at all there digest that and stop
blaming them for your silliness

  she went on crocheting again it was
a full minute before maura sat up
slowly and stared at the priestess of
homely wisdom with eyes so dilated that
the black pupil hid the amber iris

  sarah youre-youre right every
word of that went deep in me to the
little trickle of truth thats at the core of
my heart they were all right and i
havent anything to be sorry for and
if they hadnt been i still shouldnt
have i begin to see that what im afraid
of and have been afraid of is myself
sarah you see through most people see
through me whats the matter with
me what made me feel that i wasnt
like the other girls at school even when
i didnt know i didnt belong there i
felt it always but i recall one day-
the last musicale before we left for
christmas holidays-when the thing
made itself felt by everyone i went
up to the platform and suddenly all the
whispering and rustling and coughing
stopped those girls that i had known
so well seemed like people of another
world staring at me i felt all alone
horribly hideously alone and-differ-
ent but i kept on smiling and it was
after that that madame laroche called
me to her and talked to me about my
soul and my body things i didnt com-
prehend and the under teachers
seemed so bitter and critical and the
girls tried to be the same but they were
not i want to know what has been

the matter with me what is the matter
with me if you can tell

  the splint rocker stopped its swaying
for a space sfrah webb sat looking
down at the exquisite lace that hac
grown under her fingers then pulled out
a loop so that it should not unravel
folded her plump hands and looked into
space

  thats what puzzled me at first
she said slowly what was the mat-
ter with you or what was the differ-
ence with you i dont mean phys-
ically but with the you that was you
and after i watched you a while and
listened to all your delirium told me
and to all that your aunt claudia con-
fessed in her fright and to all that
mr-er-faris could tell me i began
to understand your splendid promis-
ing body was the most perfect thing that
i ever had under my hand perfectly
developed so far as it should be at your
age and promising a wonderful woman-
hood yet when you spoke to me when
you appealed -to me and when i some-
times looked at you you seemed the
tiniest frailest least developed young
thing i ever encountered its because
there wasnt any you

  you mean said maura doubtfully
as she paused that i was weak-

  i mean there wasnt any you awake
sarah webb declared with vigor
there was a pretty body and face that
your parents gave you and the manners
that your teachers gave you and a sing-
ing voice that professor something-or-
other trained so carefully because your
healthy throat and lungs managed air
rather better than the ordinary run and
there were thoughts that everybody gave
you and an impulse to wheedle and to
lie that you picked up from your asso-
ciation with your aunt claudia the
life you had even was just ordinary hu-
man life livening all that talking shell
and that life loved what belonged to it
you admired your own body and your
own prettiness and your own singing
and even your own little sorrows ill
bet a cooky so long as you were
pleased and cared for and dressed and
fed you asked no more of existence
and your body throve and grew lovely
the tin star



and took to itself all the energies it
liked to nourish itself and there prob-
ably wasnt a girl in the school however
rich or pampered that haant more in-
dividuality than you they had homes
and associations and people to tell them
that little ladies of such and such name
didnt do this or that and that certain
things were expected of them and they
heard the family matters spoken of and
encountered personalities of their own
families and began to feel certain things
were expected of them because they
were themselves nothing was ex-
pected of you nothing was asked of you
except to copy people who had no love
for you and none of the kin spirit and
as your years increased you became con-
scious of that difference without under-
standing it you were pagan just
body animated and as unlike those
other girls whose futures were planned
from the cradle as a virgin forest is un-
like an italian garden probably you
matured fast at last and probably some-
thing happened that you didnt under-
stand to wake you a trifle and make you
wonder about yourself that day you
sang probably the sheer animal perfec-
tion of you struck home to those artifi-
cial excessively self-conscious young
things and the instinctive antagonism
between your sorts sprang to life ill
wager that madame laroche under-
stood what was tlie matter what she
said to you was like ripping through un-
touched ground with a sharp plow and
she tried to sow seed but it was slow in
growing then that man at your aunts
scared you i believe it was a good
thing not good in itself but good in
the total it disturbed you again like
harrowing where madame laroche had
plowed then that corey woman-the
seed sprouted there didnt it and the
roots struck into your soul and your
soul stirred to answer the demand upon
it and all of a sudden blossomed maura
wayne and because maura wayne is
so much younger than her body some-
times you seem splendid and developed
and again you seem ridiculously young
and immature thats according to the
mood youre in -whether youre show-
ing physical force or using your little

young personality its just imagining
on my part but it explains you as noth-
ing else does and youre suffering a
good deal over yourself because grow-
ing pains arent pleasant and now
child lets get back to things we can
taste and touch and handle i want you
not to be afraid of yourself or anybody
else you drink this young barrisons
contribution from the dairy and eat
what i fetch you and as soon as youre
strong enough to travel i shall send you
up to stay with the yellow hens till
youve finished growing a soul ive
talked enough

  she picked up her work and began to
sway the rocker maura stayed unmov-
ing staring straight through sarah
webb and the wall and the present into
the days of her unthinking past when
she finally drew a deep breath it was like
the waking of one who had slept and
dreamed

  sarah if what you say isnt so at
any rate theres no other answer if
i believe it to be so itll help me i
choose to believe it sarah will you
lend me thirty dollars

  there could have been no more elo-
quent testimony as to sarah webbs at-
titude than her unhesitating yes

  thank you i forgot to say that
aunt claudia finds i have and have had
all along an income of ten dollars a
week from securities father left but
youre a dispensation from heaven you
dear that you didnt need to be told id
pay your thirty back i rather think im
not going to new flampshire sarah i
think ill stay here and eat ivan barri-
sons offerings to you till im a bit
stronger-for a week say and then i
want to fix up this room it can be
done and i can make a ducky place of
it and i can live on my ten dollars and
pay you a dollar a week and still have
enough to take a trial music lesson at
the end of a few weeks thats the first
thing i shall try to do to sing in a small
way if i cant in a big way and to do
the thing i can do next best if i cant
sing because at the very least i could
be a nursemaid and sing the lullabies
correctly couldnt i you believe
theres something i can do when i-


the tin star

  -when im a little more grown-up dont
  you 

  sarah webb looked up sharply and
stopped the indulgent smile with which
she had listened

  no doubt she said peremptorily as
she put aside her crocheting but theres
something that neednt wait that can be
done now and youre going to do it
you stop your runaway tongue and lie
down and if an alcohol rub doesnt put
you to sleep ill have to go out and get
a sleeping potion and no mistake you
think youre qualifying for my common-
sense temple i suppose but a person
with no more wit than to talk their tem-
perature up three degrees couldnt look
in the window

  maura laughed catchily

    tisnt fever its healthy excitement
you dragon of an angel you she put
up her arms and gave the stocky figure
a hug and a pat as it bent over her with
professional indignation

  did mr barrison tell you that he
bribed the girl to let him up here to-day 
he did and he said he should come
again

  well 

  well how shall i make him under-
stand that he mustnt

  if you understand that he mustnt
and dont want him to come i guess you
can manage him

  maura flung aside the shimmering veil
of hair that sarah was brushing oh
ive decided things enough for to-day
my head aches probably he wont come
again if he does i can decide how to
tell him

  even so said sarah webb

viii

  april cried over the humans that had
piled a stone and brick and concrete city
between her and the earth she longed to
make verdant and fruitful may more
subtle came to her sisters aid with coax-
ing sighing warmly showing glimpses
of her beauty and whispering of wide
spaces and far fields where she might be
wooed and possessed folk with time to
listen and time to spare shut up their
great houses and went to keep tryst but

the myriads who were money-grubbing
stayed perforce and the bricks and con-
crete and stone stayed and the good
earth underneath was kept barren so
after twenty days futile trying may be-
gan to threaten the hot displeasure of
her sister summer

  her foretaste of what june would do
made the climbing of mrs dockhams
airless four flights something of a task
mr faris in lighter gray than his winter
wear stopped on each landing that he
might maintain his cool poise on the
third landing he paused a longer while
dabbed his forehead with a sheer hand-
kerchief and turned down the wrists of
his gloves at that moment a door
opened overhead and two girls voices
jostled together mr faris cocked his
head on one side and then deliberately
leaned on his cane and listened he
felt certain that one of the voices be-
longed to a young person of whom he
wished to know all that he could in
every way that he could

  dont you be a bit afraid that voice
encouraged you hand him that letter
from mr barrisons lawyer and dont
you say a word then let him bully all
he will you stand there the last pay-
ment in your hand and wait for him
to write a receipt when you get your
hand on it you pass over your money
and come away now you understand

  yes sure sure i do this was a
vastly different sort of voice metallic
for all its youth blurred with tears i
know i talk too much but i guess i cn
keep muh face shut once say maura
you-aw darn it i cant thank you like
i want to nor him either gby

  there was a thump and clatter that
made mr faris fear the young person
had fallen downstairs but it was only
haste and high heels the girl-a big-
hatted tight-skirted over-scented little
creature-passed him without seeing him
in the semi-obscurity using her hand-
kerchief emotionally

  overhead a liquid crooning began on
one note held amazingly abruptly it
spurted upscale swelled diminished
dropped to a crooning one note higher
than the first and repeated the perform-
ance the young person of whom mr
the tin star



faris wished to know more was prac-
tising scales anu doing it his critical
slow nod seemed to declare astounding-
ly well fie passed his gloved hand care-
fully over his smooth gray hair took
hat and cane in his right hand and held
to the banisters with his left as he went
up

 the top floor was flooded with light
that was a bit dazzling after the dimness
below and through the five open doors
front and sides there swept a most re-
freshing current of air before each of
the five doors hung a thin curtain of
green-figured madras that gave privacy
to the occupants but afforded ventila-
tion along the hall floor lay a strip of
new green matting the woodwork was
enameled freshly white the walls were
painted a soft ecru and on a tabouret
beside the polished rail that fended the
stairs was a green jardiniere holding a
huge fern that stretched up to the mellow
light from the screened skylight above
and stirred its lusty fronds in the mov-
ing air it would seem that mrs dock-
ham had exhausted her funds and energy
on housecleaning this top floor most un-
wisely neglecting the better paying
lodgers on the third second and first

 er-miss wayne called the gray
gentleman as the scales stopped

 yes the madras curtain before
the door of the back hall bedroom was
thrust aside and the young person of his
quest stood before him with a flood of
sunshine pouring in behind her that made
her seem haloed and clothed in the misty
blue of may skies

 oh mr faris she came out to
him both hands extended and with a
movement that only his superlative good
breeding saved from being hasty mr
faris shifted hat and cane stripped off
his right glove and gave his hand eyeing
her as though to discover what change
in her had made him do so the old
appealing flutter and deprecating shy
smile wer gone she looked at him
squarely and her smile took him mo-
mentarily from the top floor of lodgings
to a drawing-room where he had unac-
countably forgotten his manners it was
puzzling

 er-mrs dockham assured me i

might come up here he explained its
atrociously early of course but i wished
to make sure of finding you on a mat-
ter rather-er-personal she stopped
smiling

  of course do come in were quite
alone on this floor i was giving my
flowers a sunbath but its getting too
warm and ill lower the awning it
will be more agreeable im sure she
led the way to her door and mr faris
followed to the threshold where he stood
looking in with the sense of puzzlement
still upon him she crossed to the win-
dow put up the screen reached out and
manipulated a rope and a small green
and tan striped awning lowered putting
the room at once into grateful shade
in a window box under the awning were
gay little blossoms and buds and masses
of restful green

  beside the window stood a green wil-
low chair of comfortable shape with
magazines in its woven side pocket and
yellow sprigged chintz cushions at seat
and back short ecru curtains crisp and
sheer swayed over the shining enamel
of the sill on a small wooden stand
opposite the chair were books a manu-
script score of music a bowl of rose-
pink heavenly-sweet arbutus and a
cheap gas drop light of inoffensive de-
sign with green glass shade attached to
the wall jet by green tubing on the
under shelf was more music neatly piled
and a mandolin on the ecru painted
walls were two reproductions of good
etchings in brown wood frames and to
the right of the door a single couch bed
with a brown denim cover and plenty
of the yellow sprigged chintz cushions
at its foot was a matting covered shirt-
waist box also chintz cushioned to serve
as a seat to the left of the door and
as far from the chair as space would
allow was a small dark oak wardrobe
between that and the door was a care-
fully adjusted brown burlap screen that
evidently concealed some essentials on
the strip of matting between the screen
and the couch bed two persons could not
have stood side by side and three would
have filled the more ample space by the
chair and table under such circum-
stances it was singular that one got a

jan-


the tin star

sense of woodsy browns and foliage
greens and buttercup yellow perhaps
it was the luxury of an awning or the
unusually fresh air and the nodding blos-
soms outside the window and the color
hints of wall and denim and chintz flow-
ers  but with a decidedly puzzled frown
mr faris left off inspecting the room
and concentrated on its occupant she
stood behind the willow chair resting
her hands on the back and looking at
him with an expression that a line would
have deepened to apprehension her
blue frock was of crinkly stuff that didnt
look expensive the broad collar and
cuffs of white lace that finished the short
sleeves and round neck were vastly be-
coming but of ordinary quality it was
humanly impossible not to pay tribute
to her slender yet contradictorily stately
young body that without movement con-
veyed an impression of supplenessand
instinctive grace her face he had
acknowledged beautiful at first sight yet
had not admired her face was changed
now yet he could not detect wherein
certainly her eyes were different they
were brighter without coquetry steadier
and the upper lids had lost their sus-
picion of languid droop he shrugged
without concealment

  you have surprised me to forgetful-
ness miss maura frankly i wished to
see you here to know how you had sur-
rounded yourself how you expressed
yourself in such quarters my reason i
will give you presently-though perhaps
i should tell you that it concerns my-
self-er-almost entirely and has noth-
ing to do with anyone connected with
yourself

  it was startling to see the flash of re-
lief that crossed her face mr faris
who had traced her apprehension to the
aunt he recalled understood her suspense
with a twinge of remorse she looked
so very young in that transition that the
unfledged dignity of her body was
eclipsed by a radiant trustfulness that
made a world-hardened person feel com-
passion for her and may i have that
chair he asked in his best manner
and will you assure me that you truly
live in this-er-box

  oh but it isnt its home she

pushed the chair hospitably forward the
inch it might go and crossed to the
shirtwaist box where she seated herself
with the hunched abandon of a child and
looked at him brightly she seemed to
take it for granted that he might ques-
tion her and inspect her quarters

   it was pretty messy when i came up
 here she chatted but you may recall
 that i discovered ten dollars a week that
 belonged to me well i promptly bor-
 rowed thirty dollars from nurse webb
 on the strength of having an income
 and i did miracles with it you

see- she sprang up and moved out

 one panel of the screen nearest him
 behind it the wall was oilclothed clean
 green-figured white fastened by enam-
 eled tacks against it stood a small white
 iron washstand with lightweight pitcher
 and bowl and a packing box fitted with
 shelves that showed as the chintz curtain
 that hung before them was not drawn to
 the edge over the articles atop the case
 was a clean cheesecloth which she
 whisked aside with all the pride of a
 showman to disclose a handsome shin-
 ing chafing dish a kettle with spirit lamp
 a tin closet with bread-cake in a gilt
 scroll across the front and a tea set of
 pale green ware on a lacquered tray
 she covered these wonders and pulled
 the chintz curtain farther from the edge
 the shelves were covered with oilcloth
 as was the top of the box and peering
 closer adjusting his glasses mr faris
 read the neatly written labels on the rows
 of tin cracker boxes that were arranged
 conveniently sugar cheese
 matches spaghetti and the like
 with tea and coffee canisters a good
 sized dish pan and a pile of folded dish-
 towels on the bottom shelf

   isnt it dandy exulted the owner of
 these riches concealing them with the

screen again and my mirror-

  she swung the door half to showing an
 oblong wooden-framed glass screwed to
 the inner panels then opening the
 door again she went back to her box
 shipshape nurse webb calls it and
 its cheap too mrs dockhams meals
 are rather dreadful but with what sarah
 webb legitimately takes from hospital
 and with delicatessen things and canned
the tin star

 

 soups and vegetables and nice cheap bits
 i see in the market that sarah is teach-
 ing me to cook why i get on sumptuous-
 ly she comes every sunday to tea and
 to dinner on her evenings off and i save
 enough to take a singing lesson once
 every two weeks and im trying to write
 some childrens songs that are prom-
 ising and my instructor says that ive
 a voice that should get me a church posi-
 tion if that happens i shall be rich
 glowing shining-eyed seeming uncan-
 nily childlike she waited for approba-
 tion

  er-thats promising sure enough
he agreed almost awkwardly and then
he put his hat on the table sat back and
rested his hands on his silver-mounted
cane and became uncompromisingly
rigid now for my little matter i
came to talk of ivan barrison he tells
me-and indeed it is possible-you do
not know that he is my son

  she started violently and the glowleft
her as an electric filament ceases to glow
when the current is turned off but un-
less she were a consummate actress her
quick look at ivan barrisons name her
start and her shock were understandable
emotions she leaned toward him clasp-
ing her hands about her knees and sud-
denly she was a strong-bodied imperi-
ously young decidedly-to-be-reckoned-
with woman

  ivan barrison your son she repeat-
ed  but your name

  he gestured as though to dismiss that
question

  that will explain itself as i go into
the past a bit it was eighteen months
ago on christmas eve that my physician
was compelled to put an end to my too
numerous activities by telling me that my
prospect of life was extremely uncertain

i was just recovering from a mysterious
agonizing attack the next might come
at any time and end my existence it
was a-shock rather

 yes she said as he paused i
know and so she did but her un-
derstanding did not seem to grasp that
it was jared barrison who was telling
her that he was marked by death this
was still mr faris a cold gray gentle-
man toward whom she felt a reasonable

gratitude her intuition told her that he
had come to broach something that would
touch her more nearly than his passing
a very faint color showed in the gray
gentlemans lined cheeks it was un-
thinkable to suppose that he should be
piqued by her composure or embarrassed
by her calm yet in a lesser man one
would have suspected both

  i may confess he went on a trifle
pompously that i was unsettled i am
not a sentimentalist but the associations
of the day on which i faced the un-
known may have worked upon me i set
about putting my affairs in order and
hurriedly summoned a confidential clerk
to bring a list of my holdings to be
brief i found that i owned many blocks
of houses now rented for lodgings i
was struck by the variance in rentals
and sent for my agent for those proper-
ties after some pointed questioning i
discovered that in his zeal to make a
satisfactory showing and perhaps to in-
crease his own percentages he had al-
lowed in some quarters a class of ten-
ants to come in who paid treble rents for
the unspeakable privileges of their-er-
business in my mood of that moment
i felt i alone was responsible i had
neglected the goods entrusted to me i
felt that i must personally repair in so
far as i might the evil i had been so lax
as to permit i had reports made to me
and investigated them under the name
faris-which suggested itself from the
first two syllables of my own name in
due time i arrived at the corey womans
-and found you

  yes she said under her breath as
he waited she had not moved and her
eyes were dark and intent her face
grave but she seemed honestly unaware
of his drift he adjusted his glasses
with a little cough

  on that day you may recall my son
saw you for the first time she re-
called it was as though he had flicked
her with a lash tip and sent a tiny shiver
through her but instantly she was at-
tentive again he had suspected some-
thing owing to my change of manner
and had gone to the physician and brow-
beat him into a confession then he had
set out after me having first got on my


the tin star

trail at the office while you were pack-
ing i had sent a messenger to tell mrs
dockham to stay at home as i should
call she was one of the tenants i had
found unobjectionable my son in his
car made the rounds to that place and
heard of the message he waited for-
tunately for me because i had another
attack though not so serious just after
i got you from the cab he took me
home was devotion personified but it
seems that he-er-noticed you particu-
larly at that moment of meeting it was
one of the things not to be foreseen
that he should have had an upset and
that in order not to startle me he should
have had himself taken to the very hos-
pital where i had sent you last night i
told him my intention of going abroad
soon my case has taken a favorable
turn and my physicians wish me to con-
sult a specialist in vienna after the re-
laxation of a sea voyage  naturally i
wish my son to be with me i told him
our passage was booked from unhap-
piness he changed to confidences lie
told me of you said that he could not
leave you and proposed that i use my
influence to persuade you to marry him
at once and go with us

  delicately pink as arbutus the girls
face flushed one would have known the
color for loves own without the misti-
ness that crept over her eyes or the ten-
der upcurve of her lips

  he has asked me she said wistfully
many times but i wish him to be very
sure of course he must go with you

  for a full minute mr barrison stared
at her the sphinx could have been no
more unreadable yet maura drew back
the flush fading sat erect and whitened
a little at the ironic contempt her sixth
sense detected

  that is generous of you he said
slowly caustic would have burned less
painfully than his tone but i never
thought that he wouldnt go i may tell
you that my son has in his own right
not so much as your welcome weekly ten
dollars he is absolutely dependent on
me i may say further that i know
him better than you possibly can his
wholesome sanity has saved him from
any serious entanglements but the few

 he has had have been soon forgotten 
 intend no discourtesy believe me when i
 tell you that i am inclined to treat this
 infatuation as lightly as i did those you
 are both very young there are tend-
 encies well it should be enough to
 say that i consider any thought of mar-
 riage as too preposterous to argue

   she was conscious of nothing save his
 calm gray face in a gray haze his color-
 less lips shaping words she knew she
 stayed upright and still but her body
 seemed to be swung through space in a
 great arc and dropped back on the chintz
 cushion jarringly

   preposterous she repeated without
 comprehension and all at once with
 speech understanding came acutely and
 rage seized her sickeningly so that she
 shut her hands and clenched her teeth
 is that all  and until she heard her
 own intonation did not guess that she
 meant it to menace once she grasped
 the hint a sense of her power grew on
 her ivan barrison loved her how
 well  how  it did not matter he
 loved her chaste and distant as she had
 kept herself well enough so that if she
 exerted all the coaxing charm she had
 cultivated in her schooldays and lured
 even a little instead of eluding carefully
 she could be mrs ivan barrison before
 another day

   barrison senior twisted his cane a
 trifle uneasily as he watched her changing
 face

   er-that word was ill-chosen he
 temporized i understand that your
 birth is quite as good as his own and
 as to the tendencies i mentioned-the
 sins of others should not be visited upon
 you but i have-other plans for my
 son you are sufficiently a worldly wise
 young lady to understand that a romantic
 affection hardly survives actual want
 your ingenious acceptance of your sit-
 uation here your laudable ambition en-
  courages me to believe that we can agree
 to put off at least any decisive step i
 quite frankly ask you to send my son
 abroad with me i want him with me in
 case-well in event of my death surely
 he would regret not being with me if
 i live i trust myself to manage him
 if not my will makes my stipulations
the tin star



clear in this small crisis however i
ask your assistance i do not want to
risk a scene i am selfish we all love
life at the last for the very great ob-
ligation under which you will put me by
taking a commonsense view of the sit-
uation i desire to make recognition by-
er-making it possible for you to pursue
your musical education in slightly more
agreeable surroundings pray do not
stickle at naming a sum that will meet
all your expenses for several years

  this time it was she who stared a half
minute then she drooped forward and
put her head in her hands

 i see she faltered give me a
minute-please and for a little she
sat quietly while the devil tempted her
and the beasts of the flesh tore her she
looked up desperately to get away from
the visions she saw behind closed lids

  if i had been bad she broke out i
could have done as i would with ivan
i warn you that i could take him now
but ive wanted to be good tendencies
you say i never knew what was in me
of black viciousness until this moment
when your insult waked it it seems so
unjust ivan has taken me motoring
but never alone always with sarah
webb or mrs dockham or one of the
girls in the house when i was very
weak he used to come and read and talk
to me as a brother might only once
the very first time he came he kissed my
hand but never even that afterward
perhaps i shouldnt have let him come
but i wanted him should i give up
everything i want when i told him of
my income we planned what id do with
this room like children fixing a play-
house he hunted bargains and bought
the things with my money and he came
and painted the walls and there was
enough left to do this upper hall over
he would go buy chops and id cook
them in my chafing dish-but that was
all after the first week when he sent me
food oh yes he bought my mandolin
so i could compose accompaniments and
bought the fern for the hall fie comes
here when sarah webb is here and all
the girls on this floor know him and
like him and some evenings we get to-
gether and sing and he loves it all like

a child there was a girl here just be-
fore you came to-day who got into a
loan sharks clutches shes been paying
over and over for two years i told
ivan and he had his lawyer write the
villain a letter that will end the thing
is all this bad for your boy am i hurt-
ing him

  oh not that not at all mr bar-
rison grew assured as she grew excited
but in his position-and yours-such
intimacy is-er-indiscreet

  it isnt she denied were one
big family on this floor my door is
never closed when hes here we all
bought these curtains alike so we could
have air and privacy without that very
indiscretion they know im not out
late and that i wear and eat and have
the things they do and they take me for
granted just as i have worked to have
them on top floors of lodgings we
cant stickle for the little proprieties but
the girls know im square because i
am and because ive tried to make them

like me they-

  theyre most interesting no doubt
but wouldnt we better return to the
matter that concerns us more deeply
he interrupted it checked her like a
flick in the face for an instant the
vengeful viciousness seethed in her and
then between her and the gray face came
ivans comradely smile clean eyes with
the glint in the depths that she had
kept from mounting to flame so often-
so often after all this matter was
ivans and hers it was for them to
meet flow but this cold gray man
who roused such antagonism in her was
meddling with his sons self just as hire-
lings had meddled with herself for so
many years after all it was ivan she
must help ivan she must sacrifice for
she stood taking a deep breath

  i must think she said and walked
from the room it was too small a place
for two with such thoughts between
them she went to the fern and touched
its tender fronds ivan loved green
things and flowers up and down up
and down the hall she paced ten times
twenty-and on that turn walked back
to the imperturbable man who waited

  i wont interfere she said simply
o

the tin star

ill tell ivan to go with you if he
asks me to marry him i will refuse i

will take- there she choked but

after a breath went on steadily i
will take five thousand dollars when
that is paid back to you with interest
with money earned at legitimate work
to be proved to your satisfaction i shall
-marry ivan if he still wishes it

  the gray gentleman got to his feet
adjusting his glasses

  my dear young lady do i hear
aright five-really you know i quite
expected to-er-urge at least twice that
or quadruple it and you say you will
not entertain thought of marriage with
my son until you have paid back this
sum with money legitimately earned
he laid stress on the word

  she nodded

  earned it may be in partnership
but it will be of a legitimate sort

  i-er-may inform my son of your
decision of this-er-loan

  i supposed that you would

  with no further word he took from his
pocket a small check book and a fountain
pen he had come prepared optimistic
in his neat legible writing he made out
the check and tactfully laid it atop the
books before he turned to her with ex-
tended hand

  i find it difficult to thank you as i
should youve spared me a most dis-
tressing series of arguments by the
way i need  more than your word and
my sons knowledge of it you have
been infinitely wise youre sure-judg-
ing from the voice i heard as i came up
-to make a success in your art do be-
lieve-if i should not see you again-
that you have my unbounded sympathy
and admiration he took her hand
ignoring the fact that she did not offer
it  bent over it in old-world salutation
bowed again on the threshold and made
his careful way out

  at eight oclock that night sarah
webb came up the four flights almost
rapidly a carton of ice cream held out
before her by its string her other hand
extended flatly under the soggy bottom
in case of accident

  lorry night like june and a full

moon i had to get out my two hours
off and do something summerish and
silly all the girls out on the steps but
you get some saucers this is too ex-
pensive to waste

  while maura fumbled in the packing
box shelves she found a match turned
on the gas and lighted the drop light
with one capable hand balancing the
box of cream on the palm of the other

  worst thing about this weather is
that butter and milk spoil so fast and
warm water is sickish to drink maybe
you can afford a little icebox if mrs
dockham happens not to feel pious when
you ask her but thats not whats trou-
bling you now is it

  maura looked at her almost blankly
with eyes dilated and intense she still
wore the blue cotton crepe of the morn-
ing her hair looked as though she had
thrust it through with nervous fingers
many times and her face seemed worn
by the untimely heat all at once
her hand shook so that the spoon it
held clattered against the saucer rim
she frowned and steadied it deter-
minedly

  nerves you see i expected some-
thing to happen and it hasnt and i guess
it wont now but id rather not talk
of it till i-get used to it a bit sarah
i want you to leave the hospital and rent
a house like this theres a vacant one
next door and you can take lodger
girls and do for them as weve so often
talked of doing and it will give you a
living and more freedom and its what
you like ive money enough to furnish
the place plainly but comfortably
theres five hundred still due on your
last mortgage ill pay that and add five
hundred for improvements if your
mother will take the wilkes family to
work for her and give them an interest
in the farm with prospect of buying
shes old and your brothers wont farm
and wilkes would be better than a hired
man ill have enough left to guarantee
expenses here for a year i think and
you have your savings you can rely on
but itll pay its sensible all around
all i want is this sort of room and my
meals-and you my ten dollars will
clothe me and pay for my lessons till i
the tin star

i

get to earning more i have five thou-
sand dollars

  till she had finished her cream sarah
pondered it

 all right glad to five thousand
free and clear or on note 

 its to be paid back when i can
first tell me did you know that the
man i called mr faris is ivans father
-the rich jared barrison 

 yes thought it didnt matter let
it come out when it would

  well it came out to-day you dont
like details sarah so ill merely tell
you that he came to me to argue with
me against marrying ivan such a thing
was preposterous he said

  sarah sat motionless her color rising
and immovability and high color in sa-
rah webb were danger signals not to be
disregarded

  did you take the five thousand from
him she asked very deliberately be-
cause if you did without some mighty
good reason aside from wanting to get
me out of hospital work you hand it
over and ill give it back to him before i
sleep to-night

 there was another reason one i
dont want to talk of yet it seemed logi-
cal when it came to me but- she

broke off a breathless instant of lis-
tening and she stood the color flying to
her face her lips parting sarah webb
surprised into listening- heard a step on
the flight below

 sarah-sarah go  its happening
after all-oh thank heaven ivan was
the reason if he isnt what i believe
you shall take the money back but

dont ask me anything now-

 that was almost an affront to per-
haps the least curious woman in ex-
istence but without resenting it sarah
caught the saucer of cream that tilted in
the heedless hands the slim blue figure
was swaying

 keep your commonsense whatevers
up she snapped ill take this to mrs
dockham poor old thing keep your
commonsense child  next minute she
greeted ivan barrison on the stairs
maura struck her hands together in
shock at the unfamiliarly slow response
evening miss webb oh i say

shant be seeing you again sailing last
of this week awfly sorry tsay good-
by m sure

  som i well miss you but youll
be back before long and be a good boy

  he laughed at that an unfamiliar
slow low laugh he came to the thresh-
old laughing the long light-weight
overcoat he wore was open showing the
white shirtfront of evening dress and
his tanned face above that white ex-
panse looked darker than usual and
slightly swollen but the laugh showed
his perfect white teeth the glint in his
eyes was fire bright and a casual glance
would have judged him in high spirits
he was hatless and seemed to have no
cap in hands or pockets

  evening he said good humoredly
going abroad last of week indefinite-
ly came to say good-by and to ask you
why you sold me so cheap merely
curious theres a couple dozen mil-
lions at least calculation you might have
had a slice of seems s awfly silly
got to figurin on it till i left the game
and ran over to find out why he was
not at all unsteady on his feet but un-
mistakably his speech was thickened by
wine and his wits fogged

  come in and close the door she
said trying to speak bravely and ill
tell you

  but he shook his head the devil-may-
care look flaring in his face

  strong on propriety i am mustnt
shut the door been taught not to

nev- perhaps her agonized eyes

troubled his unnatural satisfaction he
stopped and put his head  one side
with an odd suggestion of listening to
the words he had just spoken then
looked inquiringly at her slowly he put
up his hand and passed it hard across
his forehead

  it was such a dev-er pardn-such
an infernal jolt you know he said in
a more normal tone other women do
that sort of thing but they fly higher
and with jared barrison too and if
it was money you needed id have held
my tongue about what i wanted till id
gotten it for you seems to me you
might have known that but five thou-
sand  and your suggestion too that


the tin star

was what made it such particularly nasty
hearing you maura id almost ask
you if it were so but the guvnor doesnt
lie really you know he doesnt
no she said he doesnt i set the
price five thousand dollars

  the dark angry color crept to his hair
and his mouth set so like his fathers
that the resemblance struck her forcibly
but the pucker between his eyes and the
stunned look that crept into them dull-
ing the glint was pure boyish hurt the
wholesome nagging of that hurt forced
him to thinking and the process was
as apparent as though the mechanism of
his mind had been laid bare presently
his face brightened to a look wholly his
own

  was it something you had to have
the money for he asked eagerly his
quickened speech shaking off the thick-
ness was someone pestering-black-
mailing you ill swear you had some
reason but the jolt of hearing the bare
facts knocked the wits out of my stupid
head and i went to the club but
im perfectly clear now maura and
please use me trust me wont you
you had some reason didnt you that
seemed good to you

  yes she almost cried it

  fie groaned short and sharp as a man
might who had heaved off a weight that
was crushing him with an outthrust of
his arm he sent the door crashing shut
and strode up to her grasping her
hands

  tell me the whole thing maura
every word clear the thing up wheth-
er it was a good reason or a foolish
doesnt matter so long as there was one
ill take your word against the world
youve got me body and soul and you
know it dont you youve got to let
me tell you so to-night im not drunk
there wasnt rum enough in creation to
drown the hell fire that roasted me this
afternoon never mind that now im
yours anyway you say or yours whether

you say or not maura darling-

  boys hurt and mans passion shook his
voice as he bent over her hands and
crushed them to his face it was to the
boy that she appealed

  ivan be my comrade a little while

longer till you know what i want you
to know be just as you-have been
he pressed her palms against his hot
closed eyelids

  i-cant promise anything more he
muttered but ill try go on

  first i want you to sit here by the

window where its cool-

  i tell you im sober now he saw
through her anxiety and im not go-
ing to let your hands go you take the
chair- he kicked the matting cov-
ered shirtwaist box over facing the chair
backed her into the willow seat and
took the box facing her ilis eyes as
he looked into hers so close were more
than ever the hurt puzzled eyes of a
boy and she saw the veins throbbing in
his temples for an instant all that she
had done and might do seemed of small
consequence beside her mighty desire to
put her arms about him and draw his
head to her shoulder and kiss the hurt
eyes to their old merry glimmering he
leaned toward her sharply eagerly

 maura- he just breathed and

with a shock of fear she understood how
he felt her unspoken tenderness she
smiled with stiff lips

  my turn first ive got to begin at

the beginning of myself-

  why he objected sulkily have
i asked what do i care i know all
about aunt if thats whats troubling
you guvnor told me but whats that

to us its you-

  just so its you and i who matter
in this ivan and we only and to make
you see that i must tell you how i found
it out so she began with the story
of herself as a little girl in the under
classes of the branch of madame la-
roches school for young ladies a
little girl who never went home except
for christmas and then not to a regular
home with a tree and games and rela-
tives it was soon told after all even
to her last days there and she used sarah
webbs explanation of the girl she had
been he said poor kiddy and
kissed her hands softly while she talked
seeming to feel the pity of it but not to
get her point chiefly he watched her
face stared hungrily at her mouth but
when she came to the barron episode he
the tin star



understood her first halting words and
caught her fingers in a viselike hold

 damn him damn him he gritted
stop there dont go on i tell you i
dont care whatever happened wasnt

your fault it doesnt change you-

  she cried out protestingly stammer-
ing reassurance explaining and he
leaned and caught her to him hiding his
face against her neck

 thank god i never knew what it
meant to say that and mean it before
dont tell me any more you were

saved thats all that matters-

  she let her longing arms close about
him for an instant as though he had
been her unhappy child but at his
ecstatic shudder she thrust him away be-
fore he could speak sat away from him
offering only her hands again

 not yet-not yet- she warned

youve got to know everything first
it has been too long a fight to stop now
even for you theres little more to tell
for i feel that your father explained
how he found me i was sent on here to
that woman for safety i knew nothing
of her really till your father came and
brought me to this house where i first
saw you i wouldnt see you because i
had been frightened too many times by

then i got work-

  it was her recital of work that stirred
him most that record of her terrible
summer through which he had idled and
yachted and flirted woke the protective
instinct in him goaded the comrade-
lover that he was he got up and paced
the narrow strip of matting like a caged
tiger and came back and kissed the hem
of the blue gown before he sat again
and took her hands there was no more
save her version of that mornings in-
terview  but that although she told it
briefly set him raging again

  great jupiter thats too much i
didnt think it of guvnor i begin to
see why you did-what you did he
goaded you into it-insolence for in-
solence wanted to show him his prod-
igy wasnt worth a whole heap after all

didnt you poor kiddy-

 no-oh no not that van it was
for you i did it youve got to work
out your salvation as i am doing got

to be yourself as im trying to be you
havent the struggle ahead ive had but
a different one-your own i told him
-told your father that i might earn the
money in partnership but i suppose he
thought it one of the feeble pretenses i
was using to make him think id pay the
money back at all ivan-you and i can

pay it back thats what i want-

  she counted a dozen heartbeats while
she waited watching incredulity give way
to understanding in his face

 i-earn- he grunted a laugh

well you poor little romantic fool
kiddy  you make me feel like a shrimp 
polo and football and swimming cham-
pionships dont guarantee the ability to
whirl into wall street and rattle the
dry bones what childishness why
dearie i could have brought guvnor
round in time he-hes awfully fond
of me you know  and thered have been

some sort of settlement so that we-

  something in her look stopped him
she shook her head trying to keep her
lips from quivering and her eyes from
brimming over and she looked a very
little girl

  but i dont want you that way she
said i want you to love me and work
for me not desire me and scheme for
me i want to know it will last and if
we have money some day i want to feel
we own it and arent owned by it i
want to be proud of you

  that touched his pride his face grew
cold the very glint that had come back
to his eyes grew cold she thought of
the gray gentleman and winced

  so youre not proud of me and you
dont trust me well that isnt good
hearing girl but this test of devotion
business isnt my way of taking the meas-
ure of a man you mean to say thats

the only way-

  her tears welled over and slipped
down her cheeks the only way van
careful he admonished sharply
because you love me i know it now
as i know i love you but you mustnt
make conditions you mustnt test wills
-for if you got my cussed temper go-
ing and i refused-

  she caught her hands from him and
stood shaking the tears from her lashes


the tin star

with a fling of her head she was white
but strangely triumphant exultant and
her lithe splendid body strained to its
utmost height

  if you refuse that wont stop the sun
shining nor the rain falling nor blind
me to spring nor summer nor autumn nor
winter and they will give me loveliness
to be glad for and peace that will help
the hurt of not having you ive fought
it out i tell you fought it out dont
you suppose i guessed the thought that
crawled under your fathers words like
a snake  dont you suppose that i know
he would wink at your wasting thou-
sands on me as your mistress when he
would wish me to starve as your wife
but youre better than that van youre
cleaner youre stronger maybe you
wont see it now maybe it will come
some other way maybe dear it will
come to you through someone else some-
one who appeals to you in another way
than i for you love my body you
love my beauty but i love you-the
you that is you  and thats what i want
-or nothing

  maura he stood facing her pal-
lid as she was half frightened half an-
gry  and suddenly with an exclamation
he swept her into his arms lifting her
face almost roughly so that he looked
deep in her eyes she stayed still look-
ing up at him

  do you know what youre saying
he besought do you know how long
the days and months and years will be
that you talk so assuredly of living do
you guess what love is what our love
would be that you are so ready to for-
feit the red flushed his face well
i-id give self-respect and father and-
the whole damned universe to have you
mine any way i could get you  thats the
thing a man is and ill have you
thats the one thing im certain of he
tightened his hold his eyes devouring
her face from bright hair to white throat
and back to her mouth where they
stayed and now- he said thick-
ly now-

  from that kiss they drew apart
shaken dazed with eyes open to a new
heaven and a new earth  then with an
inarticulate murmur they came close

again as instinctively as they breathed

  i love you i love you-i love you
there were no other words and the three
were new as he said them you love
me tell me so but she hid her face
against his throat

  yes wait-im frightened-a lit-
tle-

 of what not of me before the
world was dreamed i loved you and
when there are no worlds i shall love
you you most wonderful you purest
you sweetest-my love look at me

  ineffably lovely with the loveliness
that comes but once radiant exquisitely
humble she looked at him and he was
startled to earth made incredulous by
the perfection of the miracle he had
wrought

  youre too beautiful what is it
you see through me and beyond me
im jealous of every thought you have
that isnt mine and you havent said
you love me dont smile-i know im
off my head but im glad of it come
down where i am you goddess girl
love me as i love you

  that second kiss whirled them into
a singing void where they clung as one
there was no little world of meddlesome
creatures no quibblings no penalties
nothing save love and the imperious de-
sire of love with his face in her fra-
grant hair he pleaded

 maura come away with me what
does anything matter anything ill
work ill do whatever you say im to do
after weve taken our space of paradise
while were young and the glory is new
and the soul in me is just awake therell
never come such a time for joy beloved
though i love you forever and ever let
us take it courageously as only the man
and woman meant for each other may
take it forget the little pale sham
things the sickening imitations of love
what is it dear heart what are you
saying 

  she pressed close to him in trembling
terror like a little child

  help me to be good she prayed
help me to be good  he lifted his face
from her hair almost angrily it was not
so that his great moment should be met

  maura dont take me for the usual
the tin star



sort of brute dont shame this splen-
did love of ours cant you see that i
only want it perfect for a time after-
ward shall come work and readjustment
and poverty and convention but love
like mine puts its lady in cloth of gold
gives her silk to lie on matches her eyes
with topaz and black diamonds and her
lips with garnets and her teeth with
pearls and her body with blossoms
maura my poor starved frightened
darling trust me well go to the other
end of creation where its summer al-
ways and the stars are little moons so
there is no night and the winds are
drunk with flowers and the sea melted
sapphire and love is born new with
each day-maura maura

 and the third kiss was temptation
in its first delirium he thought that he
had won but even as he exulted knew
that he had lost her lips closed under
his her body stiffened in his arms her
hands unclasped from his neck and
strove to put him from her

 maura and then as he saw her
eyes the words crowded back how long
they stood motionless battling silently
he never knew but in that space he
gave up the ghost of his old self and felt
the pangs of a new birth

  what is it he said hoarsely that
you want me to do tell me what i
can do and at the soft cry she gave
and the mother-ecstacy of her look he
put his arms about her contritely and
pressed his cheek hard against hers so
that for a little she might not see his
face

 sarah webb rapped after an unmeas-
ured while far below she had heard
the door crash shut had used common-
sense about it as long as that commodity
lasted and then had been obliged to re-
assure herself she exhaled a breath of
relief as mauras voice bade her come
and opened the door apologetically

 they looked at her in welcome smil-
ing faintly their eyes vague as though
they saw her from a distance through
visions and they did not take their arms
from about each other and ivan bar-
rison did not lift his face from the sil-
ver fair hair under her square sandi-
ness sarah webbs mighty heart swelled

nigh to bursting at the look on her
girls face and the smile on the boys
face her keen eyes suddenly dimmed
fuzzed the gaslight into a wonderful
radiance and there was a confused surge
in her ears that might have been the last
whisper of departing wings

  the chauffeur is kissing the singing
teacher ivan informed her with his
bad-boy grin

ta

  everybody likes christmas because
everybody is t mtimental and feels at lib-
erty to show it on the twenty-fifth of de-
cember without the probability of being
laughed at remove that fear of ridicule
permanently and a sentimental broth-
erly-loving race would evolve and one
way to effect that would be to increase
the number of christmases in a year
beginning with one extra and increas-
ing to three hundred and sixty-five by
that time the spirit of the day would be
a habit ridiculous gift-giving would
have died of sheer inability to keep up
and any objections of a seemingly prac-
tical nature could be argued out of ex-
istence by any practical person with a
working knowledge of metaphysics

  sitting before his fireplace of carved
italian marble on christmas eve jared
barrison surprised and alarmed himself
by snarling anathema on the day to come
surprised himself because he fancied he
had perfect control over his spoken
words and alarmed himself because his
life depended on the avoidance of violent
emotion the vienna specialist had in-
formed him that his very iciness had
been violent emotion a humiliating fact
to face after sixty years of striving for
that repression there was to be no
more planning for stock market coups
no more balancing of pet trusts on the
hair line between legitimate combina-
tion and federal prosecution he might
have art books people philanthropy
any one of a dozen hobbies-the vienna
specialist had shrugged and spread his
expressive hands to indicate that the
world was full of fascinating things to
do and so no doubt it was for some
people but at sixty habit seemed a set-


the tin star

tied thing if ivan had suggested any-
thing- -but ivan had insisted on return-
ing to america as soon as the favorable
verdict had been given and within three
days after their landing had secured a
position as chauffeur by the unscrup-
ulous pulling of strings at the garage he
had contributed to so largely and as
samuel webb was giving entire satis-
faction to a retired manufacturer of
patent medicines out of town

  that after a few minutes honest
thought mr barrison discovered to be
the reason behind his outburst he
didnt hate christmas at ad but he hated
the circumstances that would prevent
him from having the sort of christmas
he wished which is equally true of
anyone who says that he hates christ-
mas

  having reached that confusing decis-
ion mr barrison made amends after
his own manner he ran over in his
mind the people who were or who were
likely to be detained in the city over the
day or dining alone in his own state of
mind there was willotson of mon-
tana summoned to the city by an im-
portant court decision which affected his
interests a bluff man but presentable
there was sir kenelm ridgeley baro-
net who was registered at the ritz un-
known to his exclusive circle of friends
as mr travis and who had been de-
tained in washington by his private mis-
sion to the embassy just over long
enough to miss his steamer home there
were atherton and his wife-his very
new wife who had figured in an un-
necessary divorce case and who might
have been in gehenna instead of in town
so far as recognition of her presence
went to ask them would be to force
people to recognize their existence again
and people didnt like to be forced even
by jared barrison his intimates would
get him into corners at the club and
question him about it and the dowagers
would write him reproving notes marked
personal there was the young as-
sistant curate who could talk shorts with
sir kenelm and who would be given
an undeniable lift by having it known
that he had dined at the barrisons and
there was his bachelor uncle jared mil-

ford whose namesake he was and who
irritated him more than any other hu-
man being and who would be sure to
accept for the purpose of disapproving
with everything that was said and
served and for asking humiliating ques-
tions of ivan about his employment
still down they all went on a slip of
paper with instructions for his secre-
tary to send messengers to each early in
the morning and then he rang for the
butler to let him know tha there would
possibly be eight at dinner next day
haynes that perfect servant received
it as he would have received notice of a
possible eighty or of dismissal-with
impassivity and dignified calm al-
though he had taken haynes for granted
for fifteen years mr barrison looking
into his fire again found himself won-
dering whether his iciness had ever sug-
gested a butlers manner to the irrever-
ent it was ridiculously annoying also
it was very late he would go to bed
and stop fancying things

  on an impulse he crossed the huge
main hall from the private room where
he sat when alone and went into the re-
ception-room which was unlighted to
see what sort of night it was snow had
fallen and the streets for the moment
were beautifully white with a starless
but luminous sky fathoms deep some-
how suggesting that the planets were
withdrawn to some secret communion
the avenue was unusually empty a
cab with a belated arrival trunk and
bags piled beside the driver and a
limousine whirling along its lighted in-
terior showing its man occupant looking
over a stack of huge queer-shaped
bundles piled on the seat opposite him
beyond doubt he was a father or an un-
cle or some interested male taking the
childrens presents home now they were
safe abed for no reason at all but
with a flicker of astonishment that he
hadnt thought of it before it occurred
to mr barrison that the evenings
wouldnt seem so long if he had his
wifes portrait moved from the drawing-
room to his private sitting-room each
christmas of the twelve she had been in
her native heaven he had missed amy
his wife a little more she had been his
the tin star



one great tenderness-sometimes he had
feared his weakness he leaned his
 forehead against the cold glass

   something caught his eye on the side-
 walk below a man stood there look-
 ing up at the window with his arms
 outstretched as unmistakably entreating
 as though he were shouting appeal
 when he saw that he had attracted at-
 tention he caught off his cap and held it
 out beating himself on the breast with
 his free hand and then outstretched
 both arms again

   faugh  mr barrison stepped back
 from the window letting the draperies
 fall and without the slightest intention
 of doing so walked to the front door and
 opened it there was a scramble on the
 pavement and the beggar clambered up
 the steps a tattered man who breathed
 in whistling intakes and broke into the
 barking rasping brazen cough of bron-
 chitis as he stumbled close to the door
 lest that hardly won portal should be
 shut against him he thrust in his arm
 while he leaned against the casing and
 finished his cough

    ts food i want he wheezed lift-
 ing his congested face then straight
 three kids-one jes come-woman jes
 crawlin round ill take anybody there
 t prove it-if taint a charities man
 thatll take away the kids nix on that
 cant make folks hear me in the crowds
 come up here been sick los my job

  nix on that im goin t have
 chrismas t home if i die t day after
 are y goin t gimme annything thats
 what i arsk name o god cant you
 see im jest arskin for whatll be thrown
 away tmorrer

  mr barrison thought of haynes and
 hesitated he put his hand to his inner
 pocket

  could you buy food if i gave you
 money instead the creature wheezed
 derision he was either new to begging
 or working a novelty

    course i could  mr barrison ad-
 justed his glasses

   im not at all sure what i have with

me he said quite as though the man
were a bill collector and he an apologetic
debtor i carry so little cash oh yes

heres a twenty and a few fives-

pie folded them lengthwise together
and held them out for an instant the
man glared up at him as a suspicious
animal might and then with a horrible
rasping sob tore at the money so that
he hurt the hand that gave it whirled
plunged down the steps slipped and
went to his knees in the new snow but
scrambled up and vanished running
imbecile if an officer stops him-

running-with that money- but

after all it wasnt his affair any longer
only he hoped the fellows wife would
fix him something for that horrible cold-
as he rounded the curve of the great
oak staircase he heard steps and voices
in the hall below and leaned to the ban-
ister to look over haynes and par-
ker his man stood by the carven screen
that shut off the door to belowstairs

  ill swear i eard the door an felt a
draught said haynes didnt you
mr parker

  no doubt about it take a look

about if you say but- he dropped

his voice-im for thinking it was mr
ivan this would be the time he came
back to stay if ever he meant to come
ah if he does hayiies also
lowered his voice but the words floated
up but im thinkin mr ivan is on
his own for all time e spoke a good
bit with me when e was ome thanks-
givin an while is disappearin looks
queer an i carnt find any gentlemen in
service that ave picked up any gossip as
to where es gone hill wager anything
you like that its money as sent im orf
e was no kind to arsk for pennies mr
ivan wasnt an es took the right way
to show it es as much of a man to-
day as you or me mr parker
thats right enough mr haynes
pie had changed well well look about
before i go up to draw the barth

  when they had disappeared toward
the dining-room mr barrison went on
upstairs so haynes and parker ap-
proved of ivan the chauffeur as they
had not approved of ivan his son that
was an argument ths boy had used


the tin star

iye got to be my own man dad you
liked living your life your own way and
you did and now youre trying to live
mine for me-thats what it comes to
but it isnt possible any longer some
day youll see it my way

  some day maybe but not this day
at christmas time a man-an old man-
needed his son if only he would live at
home and take work in the companys
office or any office but chauffeur for a
patent medicine man  he shut his hands
hard trying not to hate the girl who was
at the bottom of it he might have
known that shed have some sly infernal
trick in reserve to catch a young fools
chivalrous fancy trying to make him
jared barrison go to her and apologize
and beg her to marry the boy was she
if anything less than his life was at
stake he knew what he would do and
say to her

  parker got below stairs after two
hours limp and wrathful and it took
the combined eloquence of cook and
haynes and something tasty to eat and
also to drink to get him in any sort of
accord with the blessed eve cook
begged him to remember there was one
thing to be said for the place at any
rate

  there was money while the christ-
mas bells rang under a joyous morning
sky mr barrison sat at his desk and
shook his pen viciously on the bokhara
rug as he redipped it for his many many
checks

  for money he was served and feared
and flattered and besought and while he
despised the recipients he dared not
cease giving because if he cut off such
service and devotion he would be abso-
lutely bereft

  haynes came in with a wireless tele-
gram as the last check was thrust into
its envelope and his lids lifted in the
least possible betrayal of eagerness
the message was from the baronet in-
cognito thanks small steamer sail-
ing cant resist temptation head for
home merry christmas

  there will be but seven at dinner
haynes and you may take these enve-
lopes and distribute them as marked
the top is yours

  the usual fulsome compliments were
uttered shortly would come the tap of
mrs winn the housekeeper who went
to her own home nights and then would
come cook clean and starchy and the
undermaids all saying the stereotyped
things and all coveting the wealth that
came to them in driblets fie tapped his
fingers impatiently on the mahogany
table top regretting that he hadnt found
out the address of the bronchial man
that was the one bit of giving he had
relished and to escape the perfunctory
thanks he stayed upstairs nagging par-
ker-the one person he let himself nag-
until close on the time he expected
ivan

  as he came down immaculate icy and
savage flaynes took in a note by mes-
senger from mr jared milfords at-
tendant who regretted that mr milford
had been slightly indisposed for some
days and could not accept his kinsmans
most kind invitation but would hope to
receive him later on that day that
was one thing to be thankful for at any
rate and the call with ivan wouldnt
be so bad his telephone-his private
room phone of which the number was
known only to business intimates-rang
as he went into the room it was willot-
son of montana

  say barrison it was almighty good
of you to think of me and i know you
hate having outsiders to eat with you
too but guess what the madam
started east soon as she knew i wouldnt
get home and shell be here in time for
a late dinner together so ill just order
one here and fix up the room with posies
i thank you moren i can tell though
merry christmas

  willotson sentimental as he smiled
sardonically at the receiver mr barri-
son thanked fate that he was not so af-
flicted  and then put in a bad five min-
utes wondering whether anyone save a
sentimentalist would feel such infernal
twinges at the sentimentality of every-
one else haynes tapped and entered
with another note by messenger this
from the athertons voicing the grati-
tude of both incoherently illegibly his
people had relented on this day had
sent the car for himself and mrs ather-
the tin star



ton and they would both come later in
person to thank him for the thought
that had cleared away their difficulties
but he would understand etc etc and
they wished him a merry christmas
he was about to say there would be three
at dinner when haynes who had waited
at a discreet distance announced mr
wadleigh in the library mr wadleigh
was the young curate and he came in
blushing very nervous but fortified by
a sense of duty there had been a dis-
astrous fire in one of the model tene-
ments controlled by the board of direc-
tors of the charity funds and families
must be housed and fed and found
gifts-

  mr barrison reached automatically
for his check-book received the young
clergymans thanks and regrets pa-
tiently  and as soon as the door closed
got up to walk the rug in anxiety ivan
if ivan--

  and then there was a flurry in the
hall ivan always pounded haynes on
the back and shouted on christmas day
there was even a whining babble that
told of cooks impertinent intrusion to
the welcome and ivan wouldnt be giv-
ing one of them a cent and never had
regularly that is the door rattled and
swung open

  iilo dad-merry christmas  rip-
pin day what  gee but this looks good
to me how are you fines you look
he crushed the hands he gripped most
painfully browner leaner handsomer
insolent in his strength and independ-
ence unquenchably gay-

  yes i think im fairly well but i
want you here ivan the words came
of themselves there are offices
aplenty if you wont go into mine--

  taboo on business ivan crossed
his fingers  fore i go well talk over
things but not this minute dad give
me something for christmas that i want
like the very deuce will you maura
sings her first solo to-day i want you
to go to her church with me and hear
her and after a pause as he watched
his fathers face he added im going
anyway but ill come directly back
here

 maura always maura barrison

senior gripped the arms of his chair
and his collar felt too tight but he made
his first concession

  ill go he snapped if youll come
straight away with me afterward and
make no attempt to have us meet it
was an ungracious speech undignified
and his sons face showed him how
greatly so but the expression was in-
stantly suppressed

  very well but im to be with her
the last half the day and now lets talk
of something else dad

  jared barrison wished later that he
had made an effort to grasp that conver-
sational branch o generously extended
it would have given him excuse to break
through the rapt mood in which his sil-
ent son walked home beside him after
that ordeal of hearing the girl sing
how the young fool did look head
high and thrown back a littleteyes bright
and blind a smile like a young warriors
and all because a girl in a second-class
church packed with second and third
and fourth-class people had sung rather
unusually recalling the scale practise
he had once overheard the elder barri-
son grimaced disdain take such a
voice fairly trained set it floating
through a church flooded with eerie rays
from dim-hued windows with the thrill
of prayer still in the air and the hushed
thunder of the organ throbbing like the
murmured accompaniment of militant
angels guarding a seraph and that up-
setting christmas spirit at work on emo-
tional humans-why even he jared
barrison had forgotten in the enthrall-
ment of the finale who it was that jug-
gled notes of gold and crystal and moun-
tain-spring bubbles mixed with chil-
drens laughter and patient hint of past
tears and sun-fleck and shadow strain
swirling them higher and higher till they
seemed to dash against the vaulted roof
shatter there exquisitely and shiver
straying down to merge in a level sus-
tained triumphant note of peace

  fie had come to himself with an ap-
prehensive tensing of nerves and glanced
at ivan but only ivans body sat beside
him tranced unheeding everything save
the message that song had borne to him
a woman sobbed outright once and the
o

the tin star

quiet throng began shuffling coughing
in reaction ivan startled a bit roused
and looked at his father but jared bar-
rison icy and supercilious was elevating
his brows at the huskiness of the minis-
ters voice and by no slightest sign be-
trayed that he had known or cared who
delivered the solo

  as they entered the big hall of the
depressing place they called home both
thought of the woman whose love for
christmas had inveigled them into such
orthodox observance of the day but the
elders memory took a bitter turn if
the boys mother had been spared even
though she were so frail and mentally
misted as she had been at the last their
boy wouldnt have been hypnotized by a
well-breathing prettiness he would
have remembered that the angels of the
higher air are quiet

  ill just phone the place that im
here and will be over ivan said a trifle
defiantly as haynes left them with the
coats i saw sarah webb and-the
aunt at church but as id agreed not to
see maura i thought i wouldnt see them
either

  barrison senior nodded as casually
as he could manage and walked out of
hearing trying not to let his resentment
master him naturally somehow he
found himself in the drawing-room be-
fore the portrait of his wife which he
meant to move on the broad frame at
the base lay a fresh white rose yellow-
hearted-her favorite flower his first
emotion was of great thankfulness that
the boy had remembered and found time
to pay the little tribute and then as sure-
ly as though he had been told he knew
that the flower was one of an offering to
the girl who was forever coming between
him and his dearest desire his next
clear moment came when he found him-
self leaning against a carved curio-
cabinet shaking weak painfully aware of
the blood in his head he had been
angry of course but not angry enough-
merciful heaven not angry enough to
have to pay in full the dread total at that
minute that day his mind fled to the
coughing beggar to whom he had given
so bountifully the night before the in-
stinctive human attempt to offset a penal-

ty incurred by pleading for the credit
due because of a good deed that he
should experience such weakness shocked
him almost more than the fact of his
queer semi-lapse from consciousness he
felt a mighty desire to see ivan to get to
him in case-before-

  ivan looked at him sharply he felt
when he entered the library and took the
chair nearest the door but he had been
relieved to find that he could walk as
well as ever after a momentary gid-
diness  and he felt that his color was
high

  we were to have been eight at din-
ner he said as matter-of-factly as he
could manage but by a curious series
of coincidences we are left alone your
greatuncle milford for instance is in-
disposed wed better drop in there after
dinner

  what uncle jared ivan actually
looked concerned of course we must
i thought surely hed be with us why
he wrote the card that came with my
christmas gift from him

  christmas gift from jared milford
and then as he saw ivans surprised
look he recovered himself never knew
him to give anyone a christmas present
i as you know refuse to send anything
to you under that absurd name you saw
fit to assume mv gift is at your place at
table

  pearl studs and the costliest watch
cleverness could construct and good taste
simplify had been his choice since he
knew that ivan would not make use of
money but he felt uneasy as he wondered
what his uncle had given ivans smile
took on the quirk of positive tenderness
that showed he was remembering some-
thing pleasant

  good old chap sent me a box of flan-
nels mighty fine ones too and along
with em a pamphlet on the evil of the
tobacco habit and another on the per-
nicious practise of buying on margin
which he desired me to read

  from somewhere overwhelmingly
anger flooded in on jared barrison again
to have another man even a kinsman
presuming to affect a paternal care in his
son everyone seemed privileged to
usurp his place from that sickening
the tin star



masculine nurse-woman who had sug-
gested a parody of her own name to help
out the chauffeur venture to this attempt
indicated by unprecedented affection on
the part of miserly jared milford he
was grateful at that moment that it had
been his habit to ignore distasteful topics 
it relieved him of the necessity of com-
menting ivan already off the subject
sat forward in his great leather chair
elbows on his knees hands clasping and
unclasping between

 you spoke of our being alone for
dinner he said slowly dad youve
got to let me open up a little ever since
 came home here this forenoon ive been
seeing maura in the place literally al-
most seeing her here dont flare at me
and dont try to freeze me as your guest
i should be allowed to say what i choose
besides its christmas that isnt a
reason exactly but its a mighty power-
ful feeling i wish youd try to know
maura just on your own account that
is when im away again without any
argument from me get to know her as
she is she almost-well sarah webb
says maura is almost grown up now
she means the girl has developed
changed wonderfully in these few months
of having something like a real home
with someone to care for her shes get-
ting to be a woman and a wonderful one
because most strong women arent
sweet but she is and while you feel
you could rest all the troubles of your in-
side soul in her keeping yet shes a kid
just that sometimes she seems so
young shes a baby couldnt you hear
it in her voice to-day strength and joy
and tremble and tears there arc big-
ger voices-im not altogether a creature
of one idea-but ive never heard a voice
that understood so thats what made
that woman cry in church and made the
parson and congregation husky and i
dont want to keep away from you and
deny myself her im ready to keep on
working-id have to now to keep my
self-respect but i want us to be to-
gether we three i want her dad and
shed come if you truly wanted her she
has grown big enough to be generous
wouldnt you like her here think of
her all white and silvery-gold against

our dark old woods and tapestries think
of her singing to us evenings in the fire-
light  ive gone into this chauffeur thing
because it was the only thing i could do
with my hands and ive liked it so well
its worried me but after the first of
the year im coming back to town
charteris wants me they think i can
sell bonds for em and ill be with you
more and then i mean to borrow the
balance of that absurd five thousand or
give you my note for it and work it out
and make her marry me i hope youll
take it as well as you can dad because
im going to do it im going to make
her i-love her

  after a second jared barrison coughed
slightly

  speaking of that place she calls
home he said coolly my agents tell me
that it is well kept up the neighbor-
hood bettered by it and the rent paid
promptly he saw ivans incredulous
start give way to a blazing indignation
but kept himself steady if he could
only manage to make others angry in-
stead of letting himself be inundated by
those fearful currents of wrath it would
be the better for him he knew ivans
jaw set and then with a shrug and a
half sigh he came back to the surface
civility that he had tried to break
through

  yes theyre very successful he
said with praiseworthy calm sarah
webb is in her element their rooms
are packed three and four deep with girls
who put up with crowding just to be in
such a house the foods rather unusual
at the price and its hospital clean and
prettily furnished they fixed up the
roof for last summer and had little ever-
green trees sent from new hampshire
that are growing in tubs and the roof
is fenced and the ones with a suspicion
of lungs sleep up there now with only an
awning shelter each girl had a big
box of earth for her own to tend the
flowers and raise a few vegetables and
three of the toughest shop girls in the
lot are going into the country as ap-
prentices to a market gardener woman
and theyre happy as children never
knew of such things before you see
sarah has put in application for the

jan-c


the tin star

house next door as mrs dockham is
leaving and means to cut a door through
if she can get permission she believes
in looking after them but not spying
fior instance she saves the back parlor
for reading and writing and the quiet
ones who dont want to talk the front
parlor and the dining-room below for
the noisy tango lot and the little recep-
tion-room is sacred to the spoons who
may have it in regular turn by applying
in advance sarah could fill a block in
such fashion  and though she keeps her
prices down shes beginning to make
money and theres another thing the

aunt you remember-aunt claudia-

  dinner is served sir haynes an-
nounced appearing in the doorway
jared barrison got to his feet with the
energy of a man starting for something
of more importance even than christ-
mas dinner and so he was he was
scheming as he had never schemed his
brain alert working with that odd sense
of divination that had made his schemes
so uncannily successful first he meant
to break charteris and the firm of char-
teris and billings by persuading some
active operators who were under obliga-
tion to him to combine he could put
charteris where hed have no bonding
business with which to entice other
mens sons from their proper occupa-
tions then to make a counter proposi-
tion to ivan and if need be to the girl
to ask ivan to enter his service in the
office for a year with no thought of mar-
riage much might be accomplished in
a year for one thing to a young fel-
low of ivans temperament the novelty
of going to cheap lodgings to woo would
lose its charm in half the time it would
give the young fool his fill of seeing her
and deprive the situation of its element
of denial and mystery his consent be-
ing half won ivan would drift back
to friendliness with him and he would
see to it that if there were ambitions to
be aroused in the line of achievement
opportunity should offer tf no other
fancy luckily diverted this trend of affec-
tion the year of intimacy-with a girl of
her probable tendencies-might bring a
solution of the problem fie emphatical-
ly would not consider her as his daugh-

ter-in-law but he had not the slightest
objection to her in any other relation
to ivan that did not take from him
the boys companionship and first in-
terest

  from oysters to port he exerted him-
self as though ivan had been the head
of an opposition concern whose antago-
nism he wished to disarm it was said of
him that he could gossip more diverting-
ly than any man of his set when he
chose and on this day he chose from
lightly malicious revelations about com-
mon friends he drifted to matters calcu-
lated to pique the new practical aspect
of ivan he laid bare the workings and
ultimate intentions of a dozen secret
schemes of giant import whose originat-
ors would have lost breath had they
dreamed their projects were made the
topic of dinner table conversation and
ivan responded perceptibly with the
old interest the old admiration

  the look haynes received from his
master when he entered to announce a
person on an important affair would
have driven that functionary from the
room in confusion ordinarily but this
time he stood his ground with a face of
portentous gravity

  it is mr jared milfords man sir
he added and with a startled inter-
change of glances the two came to their
feet

  poor old chap said ivan i should
have gone this morning and what he
suspected was so unexpectedly as he
had done the few notable things of his
ninety years jared milford had died
he had insisted on being dressed and
had got up to his chair by the win-
dow- to wait for mr ivan sir
the trembling-lipped man explained
and he had remarked that it was a
pleasant christmas day had leaned back
comfortably and breathed his last

  as the limousine hurried the three of
them to the old-fashioned quarter where
his uncle had lived jared barrison sat
with his head on his breast feeling
strangely exhausted after his effort at
dinner fie wished jared milford had
taken some other day to die it was
gruesome that a man of means and
standing should go alone with a paid
the tin star



servant the only one near decidedly he
wanted ivan to stay at home

  they were met in the narrow hall of
the dim house by the elderly man from
the attorneys who had looked after the
milford affairs for generations he put
his privileged hand on ivans arm after
the conventions had been appeased and
the arrangements for the following day
agreed upon

 i saw mr milford the day before
yesterday he said and you will be
glad to know that he spoke of you with
hearty approval my dear young sir it
would please him i think could he know
that you would come daily until he is-
taken away and it will give you a better
feeling when-er-the will is read to re-
member that you justified his affection to
the last

  jared barrison felt his muscles twritch
at the unexpectedness of the suggestion

 why should you think that would
weigh with my son he demanded with
a venomous emphasis that made ivan
look at him in surprise mr milford
was not a rich man

  the old gentleman from the attorneys
stiffened

  no sir not as such things are re-
garded to-day he replied mr mil-
ford lived according to his creed that a
reasonable return for honest endeavor
was all a man was justified in trying for
his money was legitimately earned his
inheritance one to be proud of and aside
from bequests he leaves your son a mil-
lion clear and half as much more in se-
curities of unquestionable value

  ivan stood motionless eyes straight
ahead the irrepressible glow of hope re-
placing the gravity on his young face
he had not heard the sum he had heard
the words legitimate and honest en-
deavor jared barrison with his un-
canny insight sharpened by fear knew
what those words had meant so he was
not unprepared when ivan did not fol-
low him into the car

  dad you heard what he said ive
simply got to go tell maura i have
money legitimately earned dad-that
means-if she holds to her word-

  as if she wouldnt leap at the oppor-
tunity to get out of the situation her in-

satiable desire for social recognition and
her desire to show her power had made
complex thanks to jared milford she
would have her way jared barrison
wished that the devils self would inspire
him with some scheme to outwit her to
out-tempt her to lead her into fresh
complications he would have given
half his fortune at that instant to have
been assured a year of ivan free of her

  i will go with you he said as
though his long hesitation had been a
striving for courage to make that con-
cession

  dad oh i say youve done the one
thing i hoped but didnt dare ask by
george dad this is a christmas worth
having poor old greatuncle jared
wouldnt grudge me the happiness his
money is bringing me i know he sat
forward on the seat feet thumping a
nervous tattoo on the rug gloved hands
beating together in sheer inability to sit
still his white teeth gnawing nervously
at his lips and slumped in his corner the
older man tasted the acrid morsel of re-
collection as they rolled into the dreary
street where he had brought the girl that
dreary afternoon so many months ago
and for this

  the bright polished door with webb
on its neat name-plate swung open and
a pandemonium of laughter and scuffl-
ing and chattering and hurrying en-
veloped them from the front parlor
girls boiled over into the hall on the
stairs one got an impression of count-
less eyes and kaleidoscopic colors mov-
ing faces and waving hands against the
glow of dark red walls and ropes of
green there was an aroma of coffee
mince pies and oranges with an under-
current of savory goose and beef and
fixingsand withal a certainty of
fresh air and radiant cleanliness that
was not the usual accompaniment in
such a place of such reminiscences the
white-capped mulatto girl unable to
make herself heard beamed and beck-
oned them up to the second floor

  the trees bein fixed in the back par-
lor she explained the last of the pres-
ents bein put on  an the girls has had
their friends come hope youll excuse
it bein this day gentlemen and then


the tin star

she opened the door of the small side
front room and shut them in

  there was the same obvious cleanli-
ness here overlaid with a note of sub-
dued richness that made barrison
senior look about attentively he noted
the big winged tapestry chair and foot-
stool by the window the inlaid mahog-
any work-table the leaded glass shade
of the electrolier the sepias on the soft-
toned walls the books in the small ma-
hogany case the single dull green vase
with the three christmas roses the very
good rug on the floor and the oriental
covering of the couch with its silken
cushions it might have been the work-
room of any much-occupied woman of
his acquaintance ivan paced the rug
thrice like a nervous bear and then
broke out im going to find her
you dont mind and was gone

  deliberately the beaten man took the
winged chair his mind was racing but
to no avail yet he kept his outward
calm time enough at the last he told
himself to try what the venting of his
contempt would do someone tapped
and turned the knob he half rose me-
chanically courteous but sat back as he
saw that the woman who came in wore a
big white apron that instinctive act
brought a twinkle to sarah webbs eyes
that lasted only for the time it took her
to close the door and turn to him un-
der the white apron she wore a green
silk

  how do you do she greeted briskly
ignoring his half raised apologetic hand
ive left working on the tree for just
a moment because your son told me
enough to let me guess what has hap-
pened and what he hopes im glad
but are you thats why i wanted a
word with you first if maura says
yes to him try to be kind to her mr
barrison what is there against her
shes of good blood on both sides well
educated in the modern manner any
girl you d have picked for your son
would probably have been finished at
madame laroches she has no money
true but you have many millions and
your son is independent now as for
social prestige just announce that she
is daughter of sir maury digbys cousin

and see em flock to congratulate you i
you may distrust the circumstances un-
der which you met the girl but you and
i both know that she was no more to
blame than a person who falls into a
coal hole in the dark when the cover has
been left up and you used to like hery
didnt you i believe its just a jealousy
that youll be sorry for when you find
youve gained a daughter instead of
having lost a son as for the aunt-
ill admit that according to story-book
justice she should have passed away re-
pentant or suicided that last is just
what she meant to do although maura
doesnt know it the woman came here
to make one last attempt to save hei
niece from your son queer as that may
sound to you and i saw her and liked
her to cut the story short she came
back in may and stayed cut away ab-
solutely this is her room these things
all that she brought with her it was
pretty bad for a time but i talked some
commonsense into her and i set her to
work to work with her hands and
she has cooked and sewed and scrubbed
and sweated away the laziness of foolish
living and shes going to have charge of
the wilder sort of girls that i mean to
put next door whod be better calcu-
lated to manage them than a woman
who has been foolish as they are foolish
and who has found that theres no hap-
piness or content in it if need be she
can swear em into submission because
she isnt a saint yet shes just a hand-
some woman who has come to her sen-
ses and is going into another sort of life
as completely as she went the wrong
way and she has a right to her chance
a right to work out her salvation thats
my creed and its the one thatll save the
world everybody his own man his own
saviour in so far as a human can be
she wont trouble you nor ever shame
you ill look after her and she
shouldnt be expected to die just to make
things convenient for you or anybody
else thats all only do as youd be
done by now i got to go

  the door clicked behind her he
might have dreamed her had it not
been for the angry beat in his temples
and the unpleasant twitch of muscles
the tin star



that his repression was costing- him
like tiny burrs the truths she had
planted prickled for the first time he
faced the fact that he didnt care whether
maura wayne were a fit mate for his
son or not she had outwitted thwarted
humiliated him jared barrison and by
every law of his nature and custom of
his life she must pay for it he did not
rise at the next tap it was time to show
his contempt

  the door was opened by ivans hand
it was ivan who stood back from it
but the girl came in alone the door
closed behind her and they stood face
to face the first time since that morning
in may

  beautiful of course he was pre-
pared for that very marvelously fair
her silver-gilt hair wound about her
head her almost too-perfect face pallid
her red mouth a startling contrast her
eyes pools of warm light the little
sheer white frock might have disarmed
another man the submission of her slim
hands clasped loosely before her might
have appealed but he was armored
against the artlessness of her the
graceful slimness that at one look
added to her height and at the next con-
tradicted it he gave acknowledgment
anew physically she was perfect and
that was the reason she had overthrown
him she had yet to learn he told him-
self that the vanquished do not always
surrender grimly he waited even to
him it seemed a long wait but he re-
joiced in it when he saw the effective-
ness of his weapon under his silent
contempt the golden glow of her eyes
clouded to opaque amber and black her
face whitened and in that surprising
way characteristic of her she took 
strength as she abandoned hope seemed
to grow tall and splendid and to meet
him valiantly away from the protecting
barrier of her sex

  so you havent changed she said
quietly i felt you hadnt thats why
i wanted to see you alone first i told
ivan i wanted to tell you my decision
first but not that it depended on your
attitude i suppose every woman likes
to sacrifice herself for her love likes to
be a martyr but i have beside a fear

lest i havent atoned for those idle weak
years of the beginning i want to marry
him sir id be a good wife a true
wife and i know that he would be true
to me i know he loves me but i
know what you feel you think that
you havent had a fair fight and that
you could offer the new ivan the worker
ivan things that would wake his am-
bition that would take him away from
me that would lead him into a life more
in accord with your views well you
shall try i will send him back to you
for a year do what you can what you
may and against that i stake my love-
our love he is to think its just a year
of waiting of engagement and if you
win him away he shall never know a
word of this bargain but if i win-if
at the years end he comes for me-he

shall have me because- and there

her quiet voice deepened to passion

-because god knows that will have

been trial enough payment enough

  the sudden cessation of her voice
seemed to drive home the incredible truth
of her generosity with a veritable blow
jared barrison felt the shock of it
through every nerve in his body and
then a slight weakness of immeasurable
relief pie had his year all that his
scheming had not availed to compass
his silence and contempt had won he
wanted to laugh outright but he turned
the nervous eruption into a cough and
was his cold composed self again

  most gratefully and as freely as you
give i take my gift he said you
are generous truly if you regret it re-
member that i- tie bent forward

to rise his hand coming out in appro-
priate conclusion to the pact for an
instant he stayed so seeming not to
breathe the upper part of his body in-
clined his hat and stick in his left hand
his ironic half smile frozen the smile
was wiped off in a galvanic shudder and
the very color of death grayed his face
hat and stick dropped and with an in-
human sound he struck his hands down
on the tapestry arms of the chair lifting
himself an inch from the seat by sheer
strength of arms his feet dragged
along the floor as limply as a stuffed
figures his legs bending not at all and


the tin star

when he relaxed his tremendous effort
he dropped back heavily staring hor-
ribly jaw sagging he seemed to try
to call out but only a croak came from
his working lips maura moved to him
hampered by her own fear

  what is it- and then as she saw

the deadly horror of the gray face she
called twice loudly ivan ivan
from the opposite room where he wait-
ed with aunt claudia ivan came run-
ning and so rapidly does alarm spread
the noisy merriment below hushed there
came the hurried opening and shutting
of doors and sarah webb came quickly
upstairs and along the hall to them a
curious numbing spell seemed to hold
the group in the room beside the chair
her hands just touching it stood maura
looking down at a fearfully changed
man whose glazed eyes were fixed on
the horrified eyes of his son aunt
claudia one hand to her heart stood
transfixed sarah webb shook off the
queer suspension of her own faculties
stepped inside and closed the door

  what is it she asked command-
ingly maura choked and found her
voice

  oh he tried to stand-and couldnt
his feet dragged-

  sarah webb the nurse put up a hand
to cover the trembling of her mouth
when she withdrew it she was her
capable self again

  go for his physician ivan she or-
dered quietly and you mr barrison
keep as calm as you can this is only
temporary no doubt but it is-owing
to the trying happenings of the day per-
haps-a slight touch of-paralysis
and at that word the galvanic shudder
shook the stricken man again and
brought his speech back from such a
hellish vortex of despair that the memory
of unspeakable torment echoed in his
voice

  it is death in life he said i was
warned-in vienna-but i didnt under-
stand it was the complete death i looked
for-i may live now to be a very old
man my mind keen as ever my body
half dead wheeled about an object of
loathing watching those about me specu-
late on the greed of a half-dead man for

life and you-you who have finished
me this far-

  and then he cursed them cursed the
woman in black till she turned her face
to the wall and put her arm across her
eyes cursed his son till the young face
was ashen and menacing cursed the
girl--

  stop there  sarah webb was whiter
than mortal had ever seen her and her
voice was steel because you are crip-
pled must you be a coward what has
come to you is the fruit of all your life
it is your devils temper that your
polished outer shell kept turned in eat-
ing you corroding you leaving you rot-
ten within claudia stand away from
that wall and hold up your head maura
if you dare shed a tear i shall despise
you ivan call the chauffeur to help
you take this man-

  oh sarah dont oh all of you-
dont on his clenched trembling
hands jared barrison felt mauras trem-
bling soft hands close and hold saw her
bright head at his elbow as she knelt
beside him think what has come to
him-and on christmas day he
doesnt know what he said hes just
scared afraid of death in life afraid of
being without love-alone-

  just as the sick beggar had glared at
him so jared barrison looked down
suspiciously fearfully into the tearful
face upturned to him and he saw what
she offered saw pity and strength and
understanding and under all his for the
striving love tearing through his outer
self painfully the suffering soul of him
gasped with a hoarse rending dread-
ful sob

  amy he cried and then remem-
bering maura maura

  and so they were married married
very soon but everybody knew all about
it and everybody explained to everybody
who didnt what a romantic thing it
was everybody knew of jared bar-
risons seizure and that the amazingly
beautiful girl who had been kept in
such strict seclusion that her existence
was known to only a few of americas
exclusive families through their daugh-
ters association with her at the private
the tin star

 

school of madame laroche had mar-
ried thus unintroduced unannounced and
quietly because of her adoring father-
in-laws sudden need of her it was he
who had discovered her and had managed
that his son should meet her her father
had been cousin to sir maury digby
and the family although they disap-
proved of the match had sent a repre-
sentative to be present at the wedding
they had allowed her to be educated in
america because of a sentimental re-
paration they felt they should make her
american mother of whom they had ap-
proved too late but madame laroche
had kept her charge as close as only
madame laroche could do until the
young ladys health necessitated her
traveling with the stolid respectable per-
son by the name of webb madame
laroche came on to be one of the ex-
clusive few at the quiet wedding and
let these bits of information drop in her
inimitable manner it was conclusive to
those who had been obliged to reveal their
genealogical secrets and the sources of
their incomes to madame before their
daughters were accepted at her school
to see the tears in her sharp eyes as she
embraced her one-time pupil and called
her dear angel indeed the girl in her
shimmering white with her marvelous
face and sweet eyes merited the
name angelic was the description
that then and there became mrs
ivan barrisons by unanimous verdict
it was angel that her young husbands
ardent eyes called her angel that the
gray man in the wheel-chair blessed her
by as he clung to her hands in farewell
and besought her to come back to him
soon it was the one word that wilkes
found for the vision she made standing
at the top of the steps of the pullman
her ermines slipping from her shoulders
the smile on her lips as she looked down
into the blackness of the new hamp-
shire night the one word that mrs
wilkes had for the lady of great bounty
was god bless and keep you our good
angel that youve been sarah webbs
old mother waiting and dozing by the
fireplace in the pretty sitting-room
roused to greet the bright face bending
over her with why-you angel-

pretty so you are an angel-pretty
billy wilkes was asleep that was the
one flaw in the arrival but his mother
had kept him below stairs late though it
was and maura took him up and kissed
him with wet eyes the picture that
she made with the sleeping child in her
arms made ivan catch his breath in
adoration and when they were tactfully
left alone beside the little table that held
their wonderful first supper together he
caught her hands and bent his face to
them and called her his wonderful girl
his snow maiden his angel come to
earth

 who shall fathom the heart of
woman as she stood before her mirror
letting down her hair maura found her
lashes wet she went over to the win-
dow outside the night was full of
wide-eyed stars the snow lay blue-white
in the hollows and magically white on
the hills her bridal night she leaned
her forehead against the glass and spoke
her thanks simply in almost child-like
words to the one who seemed nearer
than she had ever known him on this
night and in this quiet place

  ivan rapped and came in at her call
for an instant shyness at the novel situa-
tion held them both silent but then she
saw the adoration mount to his eyes at
the picture she made fair serene tears
on her lashes and the look of prayer on
her face

  i just thought he almost apologized
that perhaps youd come out with me
for a moment now everyone is abed
its so still and the stars-

  yes she said softly lets say good
night to the stars but against all the
canons of romance it was of sarah
webb that she thought as he put her into
a fleecy white coat and even as he kissed
her hair good-by ivans wife sarah
webb had said her keen eyes misty
sarah webb wouldnt call anybody an
angel she knew humans too well

  ivans wife by what strange ways
had she come to this moment she and
ivan under the stars husband and wife
his arm about her his ardent face wor-
shiping

  i wanted to get you out here where
the world seems so clean and big and

quiet he said haltingly to tell you
what you are to me-my dearest dear-
my own i want to tell you what i
mean to make of our life together what

i hope i may be to you-

  something in her face as she dropped
her head back against the arm that en-
circled her shoulders checked his words
she was smiling ineffably sweet but the
serenity had changed to a troubling
gleam in her wide eyes

  what you may be will turn on what
i am she said softly but now this
is our moment-now i am going to
ask you my first favor ivan-hus-
band

  his arm tightened galvanically at the
word the worshiping tenderness of his
face livened to a look that he fought
back as loyally as though she were a
maiden trusting him in the solitude

  you want he said gently to be-
by-yourself till you are more used to
the thought of me my dear love if

that is so- and again her troubling

look checked him her smile was a
mystery

  i want she said very softly to
take your hand and run to the top of
that hill-and slide down-and-play-

i never have played-

  maura he cried it out maura

you-you bewildering-

  woman she flashed it at him as
she freed herself with a bend of her

supple body she stooped caught up a
handful of damp snow and tossed it full
in his incredulous face and then she
turned and ran she heard his threaten-
ing laugh of man and boy and master as
he sprang after her

  halfway up the hill he caught her
seized her as she bent aside by one
loosened fair braid and held even as he
ejaculated at his own cruelty so might
his cave-man ancestor have seized his
mate in flight the stars were in her
eyes as he crushed her laughing pant-
ing fragrant cold-cheeked and warm-
lipped at that kiss under the night sky
his awed adoration vanished

 maura maura he whispered
fiercely its woman you are even as
you said my woman my goddess my
girl-but mine all of you mine
maura-girl dont look at me so
maura was it only a moment ago 
kissed you-for the first time was
yesterday may im-losing my head
again maura-you-you child you
witch you-what are you doing what
are you ive been on my knees this
twelve-month i havent dared touch
your skirt but now-now-

  now im just maura tired-of-being-
an-angel she whispered against his
ravening lips an angel-to be a
worth-while angel-mustnt stay on a
pedestal all the time let me come
down-to earth-with you

by laurance

he was delightfully wholesome
looking perhaps he was
twenty-five but like all force-
ful natures his face in re-
pose coincided with a dignified bearing
in making him appear older oddly at
variance a certain frank boyishness of
as yet unsullied faith in things good
shone in his eyes he was misleadingly
young or old according as the first im-
pression was gained

she too was young probably about
his age yet her youth had lost the

a williams

bloom which might have been said to
characterize his a flippant hardness
of expression had laid bold strokes upon
her dark and brilliantly-handsome
face blunting the girlish lines of
beauty

  he had noticed her earlier at dinner
she was attractive looking and she
seemed difficult to please spoke sharply
to the waiter immediately flashing a
dazzling friendly smile upon his embar-
rassment she toyed moodily with the
food and left a substantial tip
fate plays trumps



 the embodiment of caprice had been
his impression

  later in aimless loitering he drifted
to the mezzanine floor deep in his own
thoughts he circled absently about its
dimness

  presently in his idling a subconscious
compelling force thrust its disquieting in-
fluence upon his mind stirring in him a
vague sense of unrest which roused him
to seek its source

  he looked up at this juncture and met
her eyes cool scrutinizing mocking and
interested

  he felt a flush rising sudden unde-
fined indignation with it her appar-
ent attitude of mind annoyed him for
he had cultivated the habit of taking
himself quite seriously but as he
passed on they cooled quickly-and left
him wondering

 across from where she sat he slack-
ened his steps and stood looking down
upon the lobby below

 out of his boredom he had been wish-
ing anything might happen to relieve
the monotony

 she did not look like the ordinary
type he meditated she was quietly and
well dressed obviously a woman of no
mean station she was extraordinarily
handsome with her vivid face and dar-
ing eyes they had plainly expressed a
personal cognizance of himself

 he speculated at some length he was
not a conceited over-ready fool but
neither was he a prig

 he stood revolving these questions
in his mind his gaze absently fixed up-
on the moving figures on the rotunda
floor

 mis-ter-r wil-yum smith droned
a blue-uniformed individual

 the young man leaned far over and
snapped his fingers for attention here
boy he called sharply

 the woman across the way saw the
boy deliver the yellow envelope she
watched the man intently clearly-defined
amusement shining in her eyes and lurk-
ing about her mouth

 he dallied with the message reread
it and frowned  then put it in his pocket
he looked down upon the people below
as though deliberating once quickly

he looked directly across at her then
he moved away into shadows

  she saw him coming toward her again
tier eyes coolly boldly challenging
watched his easy sauntering approach
neither dissembled he looked direct-
ly into her eyes

  without hesitation she gave him a
nod and smile such as might have been
bestowed upon an old acquaintance

  he stopped hat in hand quiet to-
night isnt it he said

  very dull she agreed

  a moments silence then she laughed
softly

  i was bored to death she acknowl-
edged

  he felt instantly as though he mus
meet it with apology

  i am most grateful to you for pity
upon my lonesomeness he said

  at this she appraised him with per-
fect candor in her eyes noted the
healthful vigor of his frame the serious
clear eyes and the boyishness of his
face she let the silence go unbroken

  may i he asked drawing a chair
forward

  do she answered

  i am a stranger in this town he
went on dont know a soul not
strong  running around much or gass-
ing down there in the lobby thought
i was in for it sure with some days yet
to wait on an appointment here whim-
sical relief sounded from the doleful
significance of the statement

  she laughed at that he was prom-
ising

  i am an utter stranger also she
rejoined and i-have to wait too
with a shrug of resignation

  further than that she vouchsafed
nothing but added as though in ex-
tenuation of her unusual friendliness
i thought you looked as bored as 
was

  heavens-how hopelessly bored

  the last shred of conventionality was
torn away

  my name he said gravely is
smith my credentials- he deli-
cately refrained from looking at her
just myself-under the circumstances

  i know-about your name her eyes


fate plays trumps

laughed at him the other-well
she regarded him calmly a bit cyni-
cally

  that was sufficient for the moment
the chivalrousness of him allowed no
further appraisement of her no mas-
culine visioning after motives raised
questions in his mind

  and with this informal beginning of
acquaintance it was not a far stretch
to the acquisition of much information
of a more or less personal nature such
including their tentative plans for the
consumption of the enforced waiting
time she learned that he had intended
filling the next and other days with side
trips nearby

  he learned at what hour she usually
breakfasted

  during the evening she learned too
that his outlook upon life was all op-
timism with a vision wide and hopeful
that a boundless enthusiasm animated
his mind in relation to beliefs and the-
ories  also some facts about his life
and the fortunes of his future

  in a short time they were as old
friends

  she rose to leave he walked beside
her to the elevator

  it occurred to him she had not told
him her name it had been an indirect
you in their conversation

  shall i-may i-see you to-morrow
miss-

  the door was opening to receive her
she stepped nearer then turned

  perhaps a flashing smile recog-
nized his hesitation it is smith she
said and was gone

  he rose from his chair in the lobby
as she came from breakfast next morn-
ing the empty hours suddenly flooded
with her magnetic personality had done
their work he was eager to see her
again his bearing unmistakably reflect-
ing his thoughts the weary coldness of
her fact lightened

  not off yet she said dispensing
with other greeting

  not yet his color was a confes-
sion pie added i wanted to see
you-first

  composedly she looked him over the

flashing friendly smile had faded back
into the indifferent hardness of her ha-
bitual expression yes she calmly
questioned why

  because- he began and stopped

  an odd fleeting smile swept across
her face then changeable as a chame-
leon she became suddenly transformed
with a slow soft radiation of tremendous
physical magnetism her gesture and
slight laugh took up the break

  no dont she said that was stu-
pid of me

  the little gods of mischief and chance
doubtless danced their glee over this
trick of their combined working never
had they found better material for their
wilful purposes

  the days afterward almost lost their
count what do hours days past or
future years matter when warm blood
stirs under smile and glance

  she filled his days she let him fill
hers and the hours they were apart
served a purpose too pie ceased to
think definitely of anything but her she
mystical baffling let him drift beckoned
or rebuffed as the mood was on her
she watched the fire smoulder but with
ready wit and coolness defended herself
from the little leaping jets of its flame
pie abandoned himself to its warmth as
unrestrainedly as a child before the com-
fort of a hearthside

  it became quite a natural matter for
him to tell her of himself his life and
ambitions she listened and smiled in
her softer moods or when her world-
wisdom came uppermost and threw the
quenching spirit of incredulity and ridi-
cule upon his fine high-mindedness and
intentions again with inconsistent gen-
tleness with almost maternal interest
and earnestness she counseled or cau-
tioned

  her ridicule swayed him not a jot
lie watched her in such moods with
the thoughtful tolerant eyes one might
turn upon a childs petulant wilfulness
the patient reasonableness which will
presently induce its like sometimes he
caught in the daring of her speech ex-
pression the shrug of her shoulders the
impression that this spirit of bravado
was simulated worn as a garment of
fate plays trumps

protection from real and troublous emo-
tions

  he wondered where lay the source of
her inner strife what had fallen or
was about to upon her life to warp
that gentler side 

  the boyish wholesomeness of his na-
ture reflected in odd contrast beside her
bruised spirit

  upon one subject to which he often
unconsciously drifted william smiths
enthusiasm was indeed boundless it
was in an affection almost idolatrous
for his brother

  hes the greatest fellow wish you
could know him

  it was a favorite form of expression
with him she grew to watch for the
shine in his eyes when he said it she
provoked him to it after a while

  but you see its this way he told
her he cant get over my being the boy
hes been a father to almost he
doesnt want me to take this thing he
seems to think its too heavy a responsi-
bility for me too far away from home
and all that but i-gee the boyish
expression burst forth ive just got to
take it its my chance im not afraid
i know i can make good

  but away down in south america
that is something you know she sug-
gested

  yes but look what they offer me-
a five years contract at big money and
that for a fellow just starting you might
say

  he must be very fond of you she
said softly

  and too hes only my half-brother
at that but as far back as i can re-
member-and before maybe-hes been
everything possible to me you see my
mother married our father when buz
was about ten you know the proverbial
step-fathers place but he was a good
affectionate son to her i cant make
up enough to him for that even but
lies great all the way through took
fathers place to me when he was only
fourteen-and mothers only a little
later his eyes deepened reflec-
tively

  i suppose she said after watching
him a moment youd do anything for

  him-except give this up habitual
cynicism was strong

  he turned clear eyes upon her id
give up my life or earthly happiness for
him he said with simple eloquence
but this-well this is business you
know-my career it doesnt really af-
fect his life in any way of course i
hate to go directly against him in any-
thing im awfully fond of buz he
ended convincingly

  his companion impulsively laid her
hand on his sleeve you dear boy
she said

  his eyes came back to hers full of
sudden laughter

  you too he exclaimed he rum-
pled his hair tragically boy cant i
make you people believe im a grown
man gee these fellows with their
south american proposition do anyhow
they didnt have to be convinced

  so hes to meet you here to talk it
over with you she came back to their
original subject

  yes but hes been delayed thats
why i had to wait around in this strange
town but-im glad now boldly and
with undisguised satisfaction

  did you think it very dreadful of
me-speaking to you that night

  why he asked simply his blue eyes
clear and frank why should i 

  she bent a searching gaze upon him
she read his eyes

  oh well it was unconventional you
know i might have been misunderstood
-by someone else

  oh come now he ejaculated

  i could not have done it safely say-
in new york

  her lips pursed and her brows drew
slightly at the thought

 oh i say-dont you suppose-

a furrow creased his smooth young fore-
head as her insinuation crystallized into
thought now be fair there are gen-
tlemen in new york he insisted

  yes she agreed but not wandering
around lonesome with a slight laugh

  pretty young women should not wan-
der alone cither he admonished gravely
she studied him wonderingly

  but they do she said finally all
taking their chances-as i did


fate plays trumps

  at that a little flame jet burst from
the banked fire she had built it shone
in his eyes she saw it she recognized it

  but her quick gesture failed of its in-
tentions

  i dont like the thought of it i-
want to keep you safe from that

  in the momentary silence playing emo-
tions shifted quick-changing expressions
across her face remonstrance and dis-
sent died before unmistakable compre-
hension her eyes swept over him a
strange commingling of tolerance and un-
belief with a tinge of regret of humid
softness

  dont my dear boy

  why not his face expressed all
seriousness

  she looked again into his eyes his
belief-a beautiful belief-in her looked
back with a short intake of breath
she parried

  you barely know me

  that is not a reason why i-may
not care

  but-you do not really you do not
to her credit was the genuine hopeful-
ness of her tone

  he flushed deeper at her disbelief
but the directness of his eyes never
faltered

  i-care so much i want-to come
back for you he stated simply

  the demonish piercing of a ruthless
might-have-been stung her sharply

  no she cried no you will
forget-when you are away

  do you think so

  and she knew it was not so

  but you must not-oh you must not
think of me so she was awake to
its reality at last and in the understand-
ing her better self was roused to real
regret for the inevitable yearning for
the unattainable once-oh if you
might have-once not now it is too
late i am not the girl you think me-
not worthy

  i know you to be good-and un-
happy he said

  oh yes good in the worlds sense
of respectability unhappy-yes  it
seems ive always been unhappy its

my nature i find nothing-nobody-

  she broke off blankly staring at him

a dawning strengthening knowledge
grew in her eyes

  she put out her hand vaguely and
drew it back as a child might from a
desired and forbidden object yes
she almost whispered you-might-
have

  why do you put it that way he
asked sharply

  because- bitter laughter sounded

mockingly you-misunderstood i al-
lowed you to it was the inborn deceit
in me i suppose i-am not the girl you
think me not miss but mrs i am
married

  the silence seemed to shriek hideous-
ly out of the mist and blue and whirl
one reality thrust itself with absurd in-
sistence upon him her name really was
smith then

  i beg your pardon he said dully

  then because he had thought her all
she knew she was not because she had
duped his unsuspecting faith with a care-
less indifference and for her own amuse-
ment  because she had come to value his
esteem and dread its loss she felt as
she had never before felt a responsibil-
ity the need of redeeming herself she
rushed at details with nervous haste

  listen  i married-like everything
i seem to do-to escape what i liked
less i had a straightlaced raising i
wanted to get away i wanted independ-
ence it is in my blood-restlessness
discontent i do not care for my hus-
band he bores me but he is good to
me he lets me come and go as i please
i-have pleased to be away from him
most of the time i have tried to fill the
emptiness of life-the same old discon-
tent-one way and another amusements
travel flirtation even nothing lasts and
i am tired of it all-tired of life some-
times i have wanted-i dont know
what and i am tired of all make-believe
i was utterly reckless she flared out
that night when i spoke to you my evil
spirit was tormenting me but you-you
have been different and you-seemed
hardly more than a boy-then i did
not think-of this

  a dreary smile flickered across his
face she touched sensitive spots with
the disregard of the self-centered
fate plays trumps



 oh i hate to lose your friendship
just in these days i was beginning-
through you-to see to know things as
they are i have felt better-wanted to
be better if i might only have known
you earlier or later now you will never
believe in me again i had resolved to
leave my husband-to have a divorce i
had written to my grandmother to come
to me here it is not far from the old
home then when i had told her my de-
cision i would go home with her for a
time-if she would have me i meant to
write him afterward it will hurt my
grandmother she is so strict-minded and
upright it will hurt him too oh it
seems i am always hurting some-
one

 he had sat still listening but her
breaking into self-reproach stirred him
chivalrously to save her even with the
sense of his rebuff hanging its dead
weight about him

 dont say that-or think it he
begged the most hurt has been yours
perhaps god knows i would save you
from it if i could and make you happy

 my happiness- her face quivered

her voice broke always seems to cost-
too high

 presently he said i-have no right
-now-to say what i would-to you
but since you have said what you have-
may i-come back a year from now
she gasped and laughed and gasped
again the hysteria of tension the old
daring boldness the flippancy and cyni-
cism were all gone bare of sham or
excuse she was only the woman-girl
who longed for contentment

 oh she breathed that you should
want to

 but fate held one more trump

 when she joined him for luncheon
next day she was as a reincarnated crea-
ture bubbling with a hardly suppressed
joyousness

 he seemed even older a mild sever-
ity through rigid restraint lay upon him
but he was keenly alert and deferential
to her

 he gave her his south american ad-
dress and-might he write she
wished him to then they set about

making a gay little meal prolonging it
like children at play

  our last day you know she said
once when she had been very frivolous
and looked quickly into his sober face
fearful of disapproval your brother
doesnt know what an ill turn he is doing
me by coming to-night what time does
he arrive

  somewhere about midnight he an-
swered

  she babbled on and is this paragon
brother a man of family

  not exactly he has a wife

  and is she a paragoness

  i dont knovy buz married after i
came east

  that is such a quaint name you give
him

  buz my early efforts at brother
i suppose and i cant drop it i think
he likes it too

  they came out into the lobby i
should have some letters he said will
you wait here for me he added as
though he could not venture to lose her

  she assented and sauntered idly on
watching his lithe figure make its way to
the desk like wine mounting to the
brain the joy of him and a revivified self
throbbed and sang within her she knew
and made no denial of the fullness of her
heart in him

  her eyes saw him only as he stopped
before the desk the registering guest
and the several others waiting were just
people infinitesimally small and unimpor
tant in her world she saw and heard
him speak to a clerk then turn quickly
toward the man who had been register-
ing and who was advancing upon him
she saw and heard turned sick and
faint

  there came a rush of insane impulse-
she stumbled forward

  the movement brought her within
range of the other mans vision he
gazed at her while surprise recognition
gathered he stared a moment in sheer
wonderment

  she heard her name spoken she saw
william smith turn to where she stood
agonized her very soul in abasement
she saw his face go white his body
stiffen she felt the new world of her


fate plays trumps

tardy happiness slipping away vague
thoughts came out of the jumble of
sounds that other man who had come
rapidly to her and was now holding her
hands was making

  katherine well by all the powers
iiow did it happen  bill-here you kid
-come get acquainted with your sister
what why sure-of course youd
find each other out but say kitten
why didnt you tell me you were coming
on here you wrote cincinnati well
-of all lucky strokes of fortune-to
have you both here together

  dumbly and stiffly they went through
their parts the grim farce of pretense

  i got in earlier through an unexpect-
ed connection he went on and
whats all this about the boy going to
south america come over here and
lets talk it over oh you too kit
youre very much in the family now
her quick glance flashed to william
smiths face at this unconscious irony
she saw that in those few minutes a
sharp haggardness had marked it

  now we wont waste any time over
it continued the hearty voice just
state that the youngsters thinking to
play a big game and one thatll get the
best of him in no time it wont do it
wont do  thats a job for a man
automatically her lips sounded the
one clear thought this evolved from her
dizzy brain

  he is a man shesaid

  the older man looked from one to the
other in rough good nature

  a man is he well- pride and

affection sounded i guess yes-some-
what  but say kid you look ill what
have you been doing with yourself

  the nervous movement of the woman
passed unnoticed by him his anxious
eyes were wholly for the boy he had
fathered

  i-think i need a change

  and you think south america with
its tropical fevers the place to go for it
do you a slight gasp from his wife
attracted him and he turned to her add-
ing fact that country swarms with
fevers kills em off like flies

  her brilliant wide eyes fell upon wil-
liam smith

  dont she began

  the young fellow rose perhaps
he said a trifle wearily wed better talk

about it later mrs-smith- only

she knew the hurt in that hesitation
may be-tired

  it was all over at last dead hopei
dead faiths-hearts had paid their toll

  william smith answered her implor-
ing plea for a moments interview with
added dignity in his young face he
was quiet and controlled at what cost
none other could know

  oh-believe me she cried i did
not know nor even guess there are
so many smiths and he always spoke
of you as his kid brother bill if i
thought at all it was as of a mere youth
william william-what shall i do
her heart cried out with her voice

  the very completeness of his still calm
was appalling only when he tried to
speak was his emotion apparent in
a voice hoarse and halting slightly as
though for breath he answered her ap-
peal though the tremendous cost
wrenched his whole nature

  be good to him i would rather die
than that he-should be-hurt

  you mean wide-eyed breathless
she asked

  his hoarse dull voice went on i
am going a long way-for a long time
he-need not know and he-cares-
so much-for you i would do anything
in my power for him you-will-for
me

  she shrank as if struck and looked
at him horrified

  i leave at once-to-night i-shall
not see you-again

  she watched him out of sight with
hard dry eyes

  katherines got a headache william
smith heard his brother say when he
joined him later for the trip to the sta-
tion she sent her adieu just didnt
feel equal to coming down to see you
off doesnt seem to be very well any-
how such a high-strung temperament
keeps her nerves taut im going to pack
her off somewhere to-morrow for a rest-
cure shes a great little girl kid-
great  funny how you shouldnt have

the dream lifes end

  by howard p rockey

in the dim light of the luxuriously
furnished studio fleurette was
busy making tea while jim ham-
mond struggled to make a fire burn
in the big corner fireplace through the
narrow window the lights of paris were
beginning to twinkle and there was a bit
of snap in the evening air

 now the blaze started up briskly and
hammond arose to light a cigarette for
a moment he stood looking out of the
window thinking then he turned and
joined fleurette at the tea table she
went on with her task without speaking
and hammond thought she turned her
pretty head away a trifle as he looked
toward her

 whats the matter he asked so-
licitously tired to-night

 she shook her head and answered with
a soft no but she did not look up

 then what is it he insisted
theres something troubling you why
youre crying fleurette

 his arm slipped about her and he
turned her face to his you are cry-
ing he repeated whats wrong

  i cant help it she said with a little
smile through the tears in her great dark
eyes its happiness i guess

 what do you mean he asked per-
plexed i dont see why anyone should
cry because of happiness

 you dont know what it has meant
to me she told him quietly when the
picture won the medal i thought i should
cry my eyes out-i was so happy
hammond laughed youre a strange
little girl he said i was rather
pleased myself after the way we worked
but i must confess i hadnt the slightest
thought of crying

 youre a man fleurette explained

but i did feel like crying and i did
cry-most of the night

  then i suppose if you were unhappy
you would reverse the order of things
and spend the night in laughter he
went on teasingly

  id try to-i think fleurette said
slowly

  once more ilammond looked sharply
at her theres something else-you
havent told me he persisted come
on-be a good girl and fess up

  the curly head shook again-this time
quite vigorously

  you mustnt ask me she said firmly

  but i do ask you-and i want to
be told he demanded

  she stood still for a moment toying
with the teapot still thinking she
poured two cups and dropped down on
the little divan beside the table sit
over there great artist she commanded
abruptly

  the great artist is seated oh famous
and beautiful model hammond
laughed

  youve always been so good to give
me so much credit she said sincerely
that is one thing that makes me
happy

  dont you deserve credit  ham-
mond asked isnt the picture really
you  i never could have painted it as
i did with a model less sympathetic-a
girl who could not have inspired me as
you did little girl

  but many of the artists would never
have even said so-whether it were true
or not the work would have been
theirs-all theirs-with never a thought
for the tired girl who posed day after
day to do her little part in it cant you
see that it is just your giving me the


the dream lifes end

credit that i do not deserve that makes
me so happy

   i certainly shant give you any more
if it is going to produce tears ham-
mond said

   oh it isnt all that fleurette an-
swered quickly theres just a little
shade of regret too i shall miss the

work-

  so shall i-very much hammond
admitted

   its meant so much to me fleurette
told him

  and to me said hammond it
has made my name-given me the repu-
tation-

    didnt mean that fleurette inter-
rupted of course it has given me a
name in the quartier too i could pose
for all the great ones now-if i wished
-but i dont

  i dont understand hammond said
really perplexed one of the most
pleasant features of it all to me has been
the fact that hereafter you will be able
to secure most desirable engagements-
that you will earn a great deal and be

able to live comfortably-

   but he stopped suddenly as he caught
the expression on her face

   fleurette he exclaimed and leaving
his chair dropped down beside her
kneeling upon the floor tell me lit-
tle girl can i help you in any way i
meant all that i said about your part in
my success and if there is anything i can

do to make you happy before i go-

  she hung her head and he knew she
was crying again then it dawned upon
him it was his going away that trou-
bled her and the thought hurt him all
during the months they had worked day
by day in the garret studio hammond
had been extremely careful to avoid the
slightest sign of sentiment in the first
place he felt none the girl was an
excellent model and was as enthusiastic
pver the picture as he had been that
made his work easier and he had grown
genuinely fond of her but as for any-
thing else-it was sheer nonsense

  the girl looked up and read the per-
plexity in his face please dont mis-
understand she begged i know i am
very foolish-i should never have said

a word to you about it-but now that
you are going away-to-morrow-i just
cant help it

  he took her hand and pressed it
warmly thats right he said kindly
tell me now

  youve never treated me like the oth-
ers fleurette told him i shall never
forget what you said the day you en-
gaged me it was to be all work and no
play but it hasnt been-quite did
you realize how you helped me how
you warned me against dangers taught
me to understand and to care for better
things it has meant such a lot to me-
more than you will ever know per-
haps

  im glad if i have helped any fleu-
rette said hammond i wanted to-
youre too good little girl to make the
mistakes that some of them make

  it has made the world seem differ-
ent she continued ive lived in a
dream and somehow posing for you
never seemed to tire me as the old work
did then at night when i went home
i enjoyed the books you gave me i
slept like a child and felt rested in the
morning-and then there was always the
feeling that the landlady and the baker
and the others could be paid when they
asked me

  he stroked her hand and smiled into
her sparkling eyes so youve really
enjoyed it he asked

  enjoyed-i have loved it she ex-
claimed rapturously and like the fool-
ish child that i am i wanted my dream
life to go on and on forever

  and so it will fleurette hammond
explained i have written notes to sev-
eral friends of mine in paris they will
all pay well and keep you busy as much
of the time as yon care to devote to
work

  it was an indulgent smile that she
gave him in answer that doesnt mean
that my dream will go on she said
the picture is a part of it-the studio
here is another-and then there is-
you

  my dear girl hammond protested
you know i think that i have learned
to be very fond of you-but you have
always known too that i-
the dream lifes end



  she nodded and her gaze turned to a
great photograph in a silver frame

  of course she said i have al-
ways known of your engagement i
used to listen in wonder when you told
me what she was like-of the great
house in which she lived-of her good-
ness and-and all the rest of it-

  then

  oh dont think i ever expected-ever
even in my wildest dream-ever imag-
ined for one moment-that you could
care for anyone but her the girl
spoke earnestly and there was no bitter-
ness in her voice the tone was rather
one of resignation-of one accepting her
fate yet this did not tend to make
iiamnond feel any more at ease

  im sorry little girl he began
sorry if i have said or done anything

to make you feel-

  jim she protested putting out her
hands to him he stopped abruptly and
stared at her in wonder you will let
me call you jim-just this once she
asked quite seriously

  hammond laughed of course he
said indulgently why shouldnt you
ive always called you fleurette

  that is different she replied but
to-night for just a little while i felt
that i wanted you to know how much
you have meant to me-that i can never
forget all that you have done if it
hadnt been for you i should have been
in the seine long long ago

  fleurette lie exclaimed with a
shudder

  yes she went on it was as bad
as that i could not have stood it much
longer but then you came and life be-
gan to be worth while

  you never told me he said sur-
prised i never dreamed youd been in
trouble-that there was anything seri-
ous bothering you

  i couldnt tell you she explained
often ive meant to do it but just
about the time id make up my mind
youd talk to me-and then-well i just
couldnt

 you mean that you-

  she nodded i mean that i wish you
had come a year ago-before it was too
late

  you poor little kid he said earnest-
ly and in spite of himself he took her in
his arms and her head sank upon his
shoulder his heart seemed to open to
her and a wave of tenderness swept over
him she was so young so delicate and
pretty when he had engaged her it
had seemed to him a crime that this ten-
der girl hardly old enough to be trusted
away from home should be going the
rounds of the studios

  put its all right now-jim she
said with a smile as she looked up into
his face ive learned my lesson both
ways-experience and advice

  its a rotten price for-you  he mut-
tered and she heard him

  but i wouldnt give up my dream life

-even if i could have back-

  dont he said sharply you dont
realize what youre saying

  oh dont i  she murmured with
half-closed eyes youre mistaken
for several moments he knelt beside
her silently then he raised the little
white hand to his lips and kissed it ten-
derly he was wondering-wondering
if she were strong enough to go on alone
if the dream life had really made a last-
ing impression yet what could he do

  you know she is coming to-morrow
he asked quietly

  i know fleurette answered some-
times i have wished i could see her
oh-dont misunderstand-i know it is
impossible

  why hammond said aloud and at
the same time asked himself the question
seriously

  you know why said fleurette with
an air of finality i do not want to see
her now but jim do you remember
one hot day when you were tired out
and discouraged when you took me out
to versailles  then we had supper at
a funny little out-of-the-way restaurant
and went to a music hall afterward
that i am very sure was the happiest
day of my life

  really he said

  flonestly and jim- she hesi-
tated a moment but seeing the look in
his eyes went on i was wondering-
and dont mind saying  if we cant--
i was wondering if we could have a lit-

jan-


the dream lifes end

tie picnic like that-a last picnic-to-
night 

  he caught her close to him as he might
a child of course we can he agreed
instantly without considering the wis-
dom of it its good-by fleurette but
well celebrate with a real party youre
entitled to it after all youve done to
help me

  she gave a delightful little laugh
youre sure-quite sure she wouldnt
mind  the last came a little hesitat-
ingly the tone of a child that objects but
does not wish its objections considered
his ignoring them would make her pleas-
ure all the greater

  of course not hammond assured
her realizing her mood although the
doubt of his wisdom was beginning to
dawn in his mind well never tell
her he said and then felt sorry for it

  fleurette put her hand upon his arm
i wouldnt want you to take me-if you
feel that it would make a difference-to
her-or to you

  there was a wistful look in her eyes
and seeing it hammond had not the
heart to disappoint her after all it was
to be their farewell party-and she did
deserve a reward such as this would be
to her so with schoolboy abandon he
threw himself heartily into the scheme
of course it wont make any differ-
ence-except that i shall have a mighty
happy evening and hope you will he
told her now lets have a cigarette
together and plan it all out

  he lit one and passed it to her then
took another for himself now lets
see no queer little cafe to-night-only
a big brilliant restaurant will do

  but woman-like she found a quick ob-
jection jim dear i havent the
clothes for a great restaurant you
would be ashamed of me

  never he protested

  but i should be-and you would too
-really

  i have it he exclaimed a sudden
idea striking him you shall wear the
gown of the picture its just the thing
her eyes flashed and a little cry of
pleasure escaped her instantly ham-
mond realized that it had been in her
mind all the time-she wanted to wear

that gown and he also resolved on the
spot that it should be hers afterward

  hurry little one he said it is
to be a long long evening so we must
start early

  jim she said a bit shyly youre
such a dear to me i-i could kiss you

  why dont you he asked laughing-
ly and catching her in his arms touched
his lips gaily to hers she drew away
quickly the touch of his lips had sent
a thrill through her slender frame and
that same kiss had aroused a new feel-
ing in him in that moment he suddenly
realized that his one-time model was a
woman-a very pretty charming woman
at that

  but she had already hurried away
blushing prettily in the little dressing-
room she was even then tenderly laying
out the gown of the picture-that won-
derful dress of black velvet that ham-
mond had engaged a fashionable modiste
to make to fit fleurette it had been
an eccentricity of his to have the gown
real as well as the model and he had
carefully superintended its creation

  in that instant another thought oc-
curred to him he liked to dress for
dinner and he knew too that it would
please fleurette if he did so he re-
tired to his own room and began to
change on the bureau stood another
photograph and he looked curiously into
the womans face as he dressed he was
wondering if it would make a difference
to her probably it would-if she ever
knew-but she never would in all the
time he had been in paris working to
make a name for himself jim ham-
mond had never forgotten that he was
engaged to the girl in new york he
had written her regularly and her letters
had always meant a great deal to him

  ite had nothing to blame himself for
and the deception he meant to practice
that evening was excusable he told him-
self because of the pleasure it would
give fleurette but somehow as he told
himself this the memory of the only
kiss he had given her came freshly to his
mind-and he wondered-just a little

  at last he was ready and stepped out
into the studio there standing before
the open fire was fleurette he gasped
the dream lifes end



as he looked at her naturally she had
only posed in the daytime now as she
stood there in the light of the flickering
fire she was like another woman the
gown set off the curves of her figure to
wonderful advantage cut sharply away
at the throat it exposed her snow-white
skin and outlined the perfect shoulders
and throat her hair was charmingly
arranged and she had struck a rose amid
the dark tresses

  fleurette he cried in admiration
you are wonderful

  she laughed delightedly you really
like me in it she asked and stepping
forward showed a dainty buckled slipper
and the trimmest of silken ankles

  impulsively he stepped beside her and
took her in his arms she looked at him
in surprise but did not attempt to draw
away from him for a moment he looked
into her eyes-and then he kissed her
eagerly you beautiful child he ex-
claimed in enthusiasm youll be the
center of attraction

  she only smiled and snuggled closer
to him just as his eyes wandered to the
picture in the silver frame it sent an
unpleasant thought into his mind-a
sense of impatience with himself and
he gently pushed fleurette away she
looked up quickly but he concealed his
thought and at once suggested that they
hurry down to the taxicab he had sum-
moned

  as the motor sped through the bright-
ly lighted streets fleurettes spirits rose
and hammond felt better pleased with
himself she was going to enjoy the
evening and he knew he would enjoy it
because she did and he said to himself
that if the girl in the frame knew and
understood she too would approve he
even thought that some day he might tell
her all about it

  and now they had arrived before the
entrance of the cafe he had selected a
place of subdued lights and soft music
of velvety carpets and flowers and foun-
tains it was a fashionable place and
one where the most beautiful and fash-
ionably dressed women dined in com-
pany with aristocratic men who cared
not a rap for the prices since they
might be seen there in company with

women who made them envied of all

about

  at a sign from hammond thecaptain
led them to a table beside a little foun-
tain where the water rippled through a
maze of varicolored lights a waiter
obsequiously took their order and with a
sense of pleasure hammond observed
the admiring glances of several men
about him the women too were look-
ing at fleurette and now someone who
was familiar with the last salon made
a startling discovery in another mo-
ment it was being whispered that the fa-
mous artist james hammofid was din-
ing there with the replica of his medal-
winning portrait and instantly every-
one asked his or her companion who she
might be-surely not a common model
here was a choice bit of scandal indeed

  laughingly he whispered to fleurette
what he had heard and her cheeks flushed
a little as she found herself so much ob-
served she was just a little frightened
too although she tried hard to appear
unconscious and at ease now they
drank to each other and to their fare-
well party and as the dinner was served
they grew carefree fleurette forgot
that there was to be a to-morrow and
that then her dream life would end for-
ever-and hammond even forgot the girl
in the silver frame for a little while

  the room was filled now and the mu-
sic was playing gaily there was a well-
dressed throng at the doorway but the
red silken cord barred their entrance un-
til some other diners might finish at
last when fleurette and hammond were
over coffee and brandy the cord was
let down and as the party at the adjoin-
ing table left other wouldbe diners en-
tered

  as the girl sat down fleurette gazed
admiringly at her isnt she pretty
she asked turning to hammond

  he looked around and started the
brandy glass almost slipped from his fin-
gers the girl had not seen him but he
recognized her it was the girl whose
picture adorned the silver frame

  mechanically he turned to fleurette
she was pale and trembling the sud-
den change in her startled hammond
from his own nervousness and he looked
ioo

the dream lifes end

at her inquiringly have you seen a
ghost he demanded anxiously

  fleurette did not answer she was
staring at the man with the girl of the
silver frame and now for the first time
hammond too became conscious that
there was a man there he was tall and
slender dark and extremely handsome-
a russian probably and hammond no-
ticed the ribbon of an order in the lapel
of his evening coat

  who is he hammond asked with a
double curiosity neither of the pair
had as yet noticed them they were
too much occupied with themselves

  narakoft-prince boris narakoff
fleurette said in a low tone fie
is-

  hammond looked quickly at her and
read it in her eyes not-

  fleurette nodded it was one night
at the bal tabarin she said slowly

he promised- her voice broke and

there was a faint trace of a tear in her
eyes but i have never seen him since
until now

 tell me- flammond began eag-
erly almost fiercely

  but fleurette shook her head no
she said that is gone-long ago do
not think of it again let us go-some-
where 

  flammond pushed back his chair and
assisted fleurette to arise as he did
so the girl at the next table turned her
head and their eyes met she grew pale
but retained her self-control marvelously

  fleurette had already started toward
the door and with a courteous nod to
his fiancee hammond followed her rap-
idly

  in the cab fleurette leaned against the
side cushions her face in her hands as
for hammond his brain was in a whirl
his first desire had been to step to the
table and strike narakoff but he had
wisely refrained fie hated scenes and
he wished to spare fleurette in the
second place he was wondering what
marion deland was doing there with this
russian she was not due in paris until
the following day she had written him
that and even though she had arrived
ahead of schedule why had she not sent
for him at once instead of dining with

another man-a man of narakoffs repu-
tation 

  fleurette touched his arm jim she
said softly i am wondering if i couldnt
go back and tell her-some way she is
so pretty-so-

  dont hammond exclaimed didnt

you- but he saw that she did not

know narakoffs companion she had
not recognized her from the picture in
the silver frame and he decided that it
would be better to say nothing more

  the lights of a theatre flashed by the
window and he suddenly awakened to
the fact that he had not given the chauf-
feur any direction where do you want
to go he asked hardly knowing what
he said

  would you mind jim-if we dont
go anywhere she asked a little sadly

  no not if youre upset he said
rather relieved im sorry fleurette
that our evening has been spoiled this
way

  it isnt your fault she answered
i suppose im silly but i couldnt en-
joy anything after-seeing him

  and flammond agreed silently that he
could not enjoy anything after seeing
marion even then he was trying to
puzzle it all out fler letters had been
so sincere her last one so enthusiastic
and eager to meet him in paris

  ill tell the chauffeur to drive you
home he said simply and leaned for-
ward to speak to the man

  but i must go back to the studio and
change my dress fleurette said

  the gown is yours hammond re-
plied ill send your other things
around in the morning

  but i cant accept it jim fleurette
objected i could never wear it now-
it would bring back too many memories
-bitter-sweet take me to the studio
and let me change now please do

  very well hammond agreed sym-
pathizing with her and he directed the
chauffeur to his own studio

  for the remainder of the ride they sat
silent each one occupied with different
thoughts even as they climbed the
long stairs neither spoke and ham-
mond unlocked the studio door stepping
aside for fleurette to enter
the dream lifes end



  as he did so he noticed an envelope
lying upon the threshold and stooping
picked it up with a start he observed
the familiar handwriting and crossing
quickly to the fire tore it open fleu-
rette had gone straight to the little dress-
ing-room and he was alone as he read
the hastily written message

  marion had arrived in paris twelve
hours sooner than she had anticipated
her aunt was ill at the ritz so prince
narakoff whom they had met on the
steamer coming over had kindly of-
fered to escort her to hammonds
studio not finding him they had de-
cided to dine together and they left
the address of the cafe inviting ham-
mond to join them there the moment he
came in

  with a sigh of disappointment ham-
mond let the note fall to the floor what
a fool he had made of himself now he
remembered the pained expression of
marions face when he had bowed coldly
to her-his whole manner unquestion-
ably appearing guilty to her and he
recalled too the ugly sneer on nara-
koffs face as he had observed fleurette
with hammond what right had he to
doubt marion-to question her dining
there with the prince notorious though
his reputation was no more right than
marion would have had to doubt his din-
ing with fleurette and now simply by
jumping at conclusions and through his
own needlessly guilty conscience he had
made a silly mess of things

  he heard a step at his side and look-
ing up saw fleurette dressed in her plain
little tailored suit neat and attractive
but now a trifle shabby she was look-
ing sadly at him and as she saw the let-
ter lying at his feet she at once sur-
mised that something was wrong you
are in trouble she asked anxiously
something has happened

  he nodded but could not answer her
she did not know and he could not tell
her

  is it-my fault she asked a little
fearfully

  no dear hammond answered it
is really-nothing

  good night then-good-by she fal-
tered extending her hand

 good night hammond answered
brokenly without taking her hand

  for a moment she stood there aston-
ished then slowly she turned away
and walked hesitatingly toward the door
hammond still sat before the fire gazing
stupidly into the fading embers he
heard the door open and fleurettes foot-
step as she passed out

  fleurette he called in anguish and
sprang after her she hesitated and
looked at him puzzled

you cant-you mustnt go like this
he cried i cant let you go little girl 
but you forget her fleurette re-
minded him to-night is good-by
didnt you recognize her-surely

  fleurette looked at him strangely
you dont mean - that the girl
with-

  yes said hammond it was my
fiancee

  with timid step fleurette reentered
the room and came slowly to his side
tenderly she placed her hand upon his
shoulder and looked up at him sympa-
thetically poor jim she said it
is my fault then narakoff knew me
of course he will tell her-

  it isnt that hammond said i
have been an idiot if i had acted like
a sane man instead of as a guilty boy
it would have been all right i suppose
but it is too late now-the damage is
done

  he sat down on the edge of the big
cosy corner and sat studying the floor
undecided the note seemed to be con-
clusive evidence that he had been a fool
yet-knowing the escapades of boris
narakoff-he could not help the cruel
feeling of doubt that kept creeping into
his mind he knew it was unfair to
marion unworthy of himself but
what he asked himself was she doing
with this libertine under any circum-
stances 

  fleurette watched him uncertainly for
a moment then she tiptoed over closed
the door and returned to hammonds
side kneeling down before him she
raised his head in her small hands and
looked into his troubled face jim
she said i have a plan f will go to


the dream lifes end

her and tell her all about it-about our
good-by party and about boris too
hammond took her pale face in both
his hands and kissed her forehead

  no little girl that will not do he
said tenderly in the first place i would
not let you humiliate yourself in that way
for me what is more it would not help
any

  but jim she pleaded you are un-
happy and it is all my fault

  it isnt he protested and with a
sudden wave of feeling drew her close
to him he saw the light in her eyes
and realized that her heart was all his-
that she would willingly sacrifice every-
thing to make him happy ite wondered
how many women loved as she did

  you dear girl he exclaimed and
bending down kissed her red lips pas-
sionately for several minutes they did
not stir to fleurette it seemed more
of a dream than ever and as hammond
felt her heart beating wildly against his
he completely forgot the sorrow that had
possessed him a moment before

  fleurette he murmured will you
marry me

  she stirred in his arms and attempted
to draw away but he only held her more
tightly and he felt her warm breath
coming rapidly

  no jim dear she answered posi-
tively it is impossible

  it isnt he exclaimed straining her
to him

  it is she said quickly oh jim
i love you too much

  but you must he urged i want
you dear-i need you

  she stroked his hair tenderly you
think you do jim but it would not last
this is my night-the last wonderful
night of the wonderful dream life let
me stay here with you-just a little
while then i must go-and to-morrow
you must go to her

  in the gray light of the dawn fleu-
rette stirred uneasily and raised herself
on the couch on tiptoe she slipped
quietly into the little bedroom where
hammond was still sleeping she
smiled down at him and leaning over
gently brushed his forehead with her

lips for a moment she gazed long-
ingly at him then moved silently toward
the door the dream life was over
she crossed the studio and slipped out
closing the door noiselessly behind her

  there was a messenger ascending the
stairs he glanced curiously at fleu-
rette but she paid no attention to him
hurrying down and out into the street

  back in the studio plammond was
awakened suddenly with the feeling that
something was wrong dazed he arose
as the knocking at the door continued
opening it he found the messenger there
with a letter written on the stationery
of the ritz

  explanations are useless it ran
do not think it makes any difference
to me and i know it makes none to you
i hope you will be very happy with her
she is quite beautiful by the time this
reaches you i shall have left paris
within the week i shall become the
princess narakoff

  hammond smiled rather bitterly
then his expression softened and he
turned back into the room fleurette
fleurette he called eagerly there was
no answer

  for the first time he realized that she
was not there he quickly searched the
apartment but she was gone for a
moment he stood stunned then to the
astonishment of the messenger whom
he had forgotten to fee plammond
dashed from the room and took the
narrow stairs two at a time

  disheveled like a madman he ran
through the street he had only a vague
idea of where he was going but some-
how a voice within him told him to
hurry toward the seine along the river
bank he ran wildly up and down look-
ing everywhere and arousing the aston-
ishment of laborers going to work

  now there came a cry just ahead of
him a gendarme pointed and called
shrilly

  hammond looked in the direction that
men were running and with an exclama-
tion of horror dashed after them but a
little way off a small figure was climbing
over the rail of the bridge he called
madly but she did not hear

  to hammond it seemed an eternity as
the ladder of fame



she stood there swaying fearing perhaps
to take the plunge a moment more and
he could reach her the gendarme was
running breathlessly by his side-but
could they arrive at her side in time

  the figure dropped a little her hands
still clung to the rail a moment more
and it would be too late but in that
instant hammond threw himself against
the rail and caught her arm in a vicelike

grip-

  with the aid of the gendarme he

pulled her back shivering and sobbing
bitterly

  fleurette hammond exclaimed
what on earth made you attempt this 

  she looked up suddenly for the first
time recognizing the man who held her
in his arms

  a smile came over her face-a sorry
sort of smile the dream life is over
she said

  it isnt-it isnt dear hammond
said tenderly it has only just begun

the ladder of fame

          by lucy stone terrill

the first step

it was a fourth of july evening
ruth always remembered that he
said her fingers smelled like fire-
crackers when he kissed them she
wore a little checked gingham dress with
white-all-over-embroidery yoke and cuffs
and they talked about what a woman
should mean to her husband

  there was moonlight-of course there
was moonlight and the catalpas were
sweet with bloom they stole across the
campus under the shade of the thick
trees and sat down on the steps of the
old normal building where ruths moth-
er had learned to be a teacher some thirty
years before ruth had not wished to be
a teacher she had expected to write
books but nothing as yet had presented
itself for material

  oh tom i wish i could put the
beauty of this night down on paper she
breathed as he lowered her gently into
a secluded corner of the steps

  you bet its a peach of a night all
right lets walk over to the lake and
ill take you out a while

  oh i wish i could in more worldly
tones id just love to but ive got to
go back and study that psychology les-
son i dont know of anything worse
than summer schools

  i do having the girl you love go to
one tom himself liacl found school
tiresome tte was now a man of the
world

  tom after a short silence you
mustnt say things like that any more
its all right to say you like me but i
just dont think its right to talk that
way about love-i think we ought to
keep it a real-well a real sacred thing
she put her warm slender fingers over
his hand to soften the rebuke of the
words

  maybe im different from other girls
but i cant help feeling that way about
it

  of course youre different from oth-
er girls-a heap it didnt take me long
to find it out either but say ruth
tell me honest how old are you
what good would it do you if i did
im old enough to be a junior here at
normal and i dont see what difference
it makes to you

  the boy-he was very much of a man
to ruth-put his arms around her and
kissed her

  i want you to marry me ruth he
said thats why i want to know
oh my goodness breathed ruth
reverently

  it had come a proposal and she
had not been wicked after all to let him
kiss her for these several weeks past
her mother had been most specific in
stating that the only time people were
supposed to kiss each other was when
they were married or engaged and
of course tom had known all along that
he would propose some day


the ladder of fame

  the boy that is the man waited si-
lently then ruth lifted her very seri-
ous and also very sweet face to his and
kissed him

  you know i love you tom she
whispered or i never would have let
you kiss me but oh my dear i can
never marry you

  her voice suggested insurmountable
barriers between him and her but he put
them aside with manly directness

  oh get out-why cant you

  she straightened up with a sudden lit-
tle jerk and regarded him reprovingly
she felt this matter far too deeply to be
met with any such frivolous rebuke as
oh get out but toms next remark
was sufficiently serious

  why ruth there cant be any rea-
sons why we shouldnt marry each other
-were just meant for each other thats
all why do you think you cant

  ruth folded her hands in her lap and
stated her reason briefly

  father borrowed money to send me
back here to school thats why i go
summers too-so i can hurry and pay
it back

  why sweetheart you didnt think
that would make any difference to me
did you came the quick assurance as
he covered the tightly clasped hands with
his being a clcrk in a jewelry store a
little money was of no moment to tom

  oh yes it does i never could let
anybody else pay it and besides there
is another reason

  her voice brimmed with the promise
of a serious mystery and he whispered
back an impatient yes

  ive always thought that some day
when ive had more experience i would

- she hesitated-write

  now look here ruth argued tom
gruffly thats nonsense t suppose
every girl thinks shell be a great actress
or-or something but theyre mighty
glad to get a good home with a man
who loves them after a while there isnt
anything that beats a happy little home
the decision in his tones left no room
for argument

  of course happiness is all that
counts but we cant all find it in the same
way quoted ruth in the words of her

last library book i shall never give
up my ideals if others have accom-
plished what they set out to why cant

i

  well why couldnt you-write he
seemed more ashamed of the word than
she as well if you were married to me
as if you were single well have a girl
to do the work

  toms philosophy supplemented by
the hired girl was hard to upset occu-
pied as was her mind with half a dozen
sensations so she surrendered a point

  i suppose i could-if you were will-
ing but still if i had a home of my
own id want to do every single thing
that i could myself thats what makes
women happy in their homes dont you
think so

  his approving embrace agreed with
her so heartily that it showed his failure
to catch the drift of her argument

  and so she explained id be so
busy with my home that i wouldnt have
any time to write and then id be un-
happy besides theres mother shell
think im too young and i couldnt ever
do anything no matter how much i
wanted to that would hurt mother
oh you sweet little thing breathed
tom in reverent admiration id be a
beast to want you to do anything to hurt
her but shell want you to be happy
wont she

  he was always right of course her
mother would want her to be happy
she gave a little affirmative sigh and
nestled to him contentedly the psy-
chology lesson remained at her boarding-
house unstudied while ruth delved into
deeper matters tom leaned against the
stone post and held her close to him
with his free hand he drew a purple
velvet box from his pocket and snapped
it open disclosing a modest diamond that
sparkled faintly in the moonlight

  for my own darling he said with
pride and ruths throat choked as he
slipped it over her finger

  oh tom i hope ill always deserve
it she said softly i love you just
awfully

  it was not at all as she had dreamed of
it but her mind could not think of beau-
tiful things to say when her heart was
the ladder of fame



taking up all her attention she was so
happy that long years after the same hurt
crept into her throat when she thought
about it

  ive been afraid she confessed in a
whisper that youd think i was awfully
-common or something and that you
wouldnt respect me because ive let you
kiss me and-and everything

   well if you arent the limit laughed
tom comforting her with lips and arms
of course i respect you-all the fel-
lows do you know fellows get together
and talk these things over and they all
know youre a mighty fine girl but
ruth his voice fell to a stern serious
whisper i do want you to tell me if
youve ever-ever let anybody else love
you like this

  no slowly

  honestly ruth

  n-o still more slowly not like
this i wish you wouldnt ask me
tom in her voice was a faint sorrow-
ful reminiscence of other loves and she
wondered what she would say next but
left it to luck her tongue had a most
surprising way of tripping off by itself
with no mental suggestion whatever

  ruth ive always thought i was
the first man to love you why i was
sure of it for it had taken weeks of
the most tactful management to even
press ruths arm unrebuked and
months of the most ardent persuasion to
earn the joy of kissing her for her
mothers little twilight talks on a girls
self-respect had taken deep root the
astonishment in toms voice now was
not exactly satisfactory to ruth though
she didnt in the least know why

  youve never asked me before she
argued in soft tones and toms jealousy
instantly flamed

  of course not-i trusted you and i
told you everything about myself to
think of another man kissing you-

o-oh

  he turned away from her but the mis-
ery of that o-oh lingered pleasantly in
ruths ears what a glorious thing-to
be so loved

  why tom youve kissed girls lots
of times youve told me so yourself

  its different with a girl a fellow

dont have any respect for a girl that
everybodys kissed who was the fel-
low 

  what fellow

  look here ruth dont fool with me
any longer cant you see im nearly
crazy i say who is this fellow youve
never told me about as proof posi-
tive of his approaching insanity tom
rose and walked with quick nervous steps
to and fro in front of her ruths heart
fluttered and sang alternately but the
song was joyful and the fluttering sweet

  hes dead now came the gentle and
unexpected answer from ruths lips as
much unexpected to ruth as to tom but
the sad little note in her voice sang a
requiem for the dead lover

  oh said tom weakly why didnt
you ever tell me ruth do you still
love him 

  not the way i do you tom she ad-
mitted in a low voice but i suppose

i-i will always remember

  tom completely softened sat down
again and drew her head against his
shoulder iter face was sweeter than
ever shadowed with this past sorrow of
her life

  tell me about it sweetheart

he-he was killed last year of
course i was quite young and he was lots
older but-but it was awfully hard
there were real tears in ruths eyes
how was he killed dear asked the
tender sympathetic voice

  in an automobile oh lets not talk
about it any more she pleaded ill
tell you all about it some other time it
seems like i cant talk of him-to-night
all right dear said tom realizing
the delicacy of the situation just tell
me his name

  walter walter reynolds thus she
paid tribute to a ninth-grade admirer
whose courtship had reached its climax
in the gift of a stale box of chocolates
decorated with a scrawled red crayon
love you on the cover

  but her imagination bumped into the
disturbing thought that when they were
married tom might mention the be-
reaved walter to her mother or meet
him in the flesh so she smoothed back
her rumpled hair and said wearily
io

the ladder of fame

   dear of course i didnt love him as
i do you and you must take me home
now i feel all tired out does it make
any difference in your love for me

  of course not sweetheart i am so
sorry said the penitent tom and ill
wait for you just as long as you want me
to will you forgive me for acting the
way i did

  ruth was most generous in her for-
giveness

  the porch of her boarding-house was
deserted so she told him he might stay
live minutes longer and they sat down
for an hour

  we will be very happy dear he
said

   yes always said ruth

  are you sure you love me more than
-than the man who died

   oh yes at least she could be sin-
cere in that

   over in the next yard will and jim-
mie livingston were shooting off late
sky-rockets

  sweetheart do you like kids he
whispered

  yes i love them she whispered
back somehow feeling the solemnity of
the question

  some day well have two kids like
that

   ruths heart almost left her body she
gasped surely she stood on the pin-
nacle of happiness and understanding
but it was startling yet she reflected
she should be unashamed and proud to
talk of such things to the man who was
to be her husband not to be outdone
in the prophecy she added softly

   yes and a little girl

   so they sat there serious and happy
watching the sky-rockets and ruth was
seventeen

  that night when she had undressed
and knelt by her bed in the moonlight
she looked long at the modest diamond
glimmering faintly on her third finger
before she bowed her head upon it and
prayed earnestly

   dear god forgive what i said about
walter and make tom forget it bless
father and mother and tom  and oh
god make me as good a woman as
mother is so i can be a good wife for

tom and make him love me always
for jesus sake amen

the second stef

  the death of a rich old aunt sent
ruth to college still with the modest dia-
mond on her third linger for tom had
hopes that in four years she would glean
sufficient understanding to enable her to
keep house for him and tom loved
her

  but just as her letters began to talk
of dark red velvet curtains in their liv-
ing-room her grandmother died and
ruth decided on a two years graduate
course then the diamond came off
for toms ideas on what a woman
should mean to her husband could not
keep pace with ruths so he transplanted
his diamond to the third finger of an-
other girl who never expected to write
and who preferred scrim curtains sten-
ciled with yellow poppies for the living-
room

  the two years endowed tom with
twin girls and ruth with the greater
part of the alphabet after her name but
with no promise of a change in it other-
wise she went straight from her uni-
versity for a vacation with friends on
a wyoming ranch where she met men
really very interesting men who had
either forgotten or had never known
whether shakespeare was bacon or the
king of england

  the big sunburned man on the next
ranch who had chosen to raise cattle
and alfalfa rather than rows for a rail-
road in a lawyers office allowed ruth to
ride with his boys one morning while
they cut out the calves for branding
ruth had longed to see a real round-
up so her friends asked mr blair to
take her

  it was her first long ride and after
two hours of constant trotting through
the dusty sage brush her knees began to
weaken and ache and a sharp pain caught
her side her companion though pleas-
ant and courteous would plainly have
preferred her absence mrs king had
told her

  he doesnt care for women a bit so
you neednt try to be entertaining-just
enjoy your ride and dont go too far
the ladder of fame



  however it was growing impossible
to enjoy anything and as they trotted
on and on after first one and then an-
other elusive cow or steer it took all her
energy to remain in the saddle while her
well-trained cow pony turned and twisted
like an eel still she kept her back
straight as her friend had instructed
and tried to forget the existence of the
saddle-horn so that she might overcome
her wild desire to clutch it

  after each bunch of cows and calves
was rounded up and turned over to the
boys with the herd the big rancher re-
turned dutifully to her side and each
time ruth greeted him with a little
crooked grin of torture

  were getting along fine he told her
youre a pretty good mascot enjoy-
ing yourself

  oh yes lied ruth its great but
thinking as she watched him sitting so
easily in his saddle i hate you-i hate
you-you great brute

  it would have surprised her host in-
tently could he have known that the
smile was one of torture and that the
straight figure beside him was aching in
every joint and hating him most cor-
dially for his unconcern wyoming
girls ride long and hard in the saddle and
mrs king had said nothing of ruths
amateur horsemanship when she request-
ed him to take her

  you sit your saddle first rate he
commented ever ride much

  oh yes i rode an old lame white
horse across the stage in a college play
once

  but he had turned sharply after an
escaping calf and missed the point of
her answer glad of his absence ruth
pulled down her riding skirts though
she really didnt care very much wheth-
er they were above her riding boots or
not if she could only keep them between
her stinging knees and the saddle if
jane sent her out with such an utter
beast she didnt care how she looked nor
what he thought of her she tried to
move her foot from the stirrup to rest
it until he came back but the foot
wouldnt move every joint and muscle
was howling with pain the sun was
scorching

 oh i wish i were deadi she
groaned for the mere pleasure of hear-
ing the words

  whos dead inquired blair loping
up to her

  i said that old cow looked about
dead why dont you feed them mr
blair

  oh no use he laughed we just
keep those old cows to raise calves the
color flamed into ruths face and she bit
her lip angrily but the man perfectly
unaware that he had made other than
an ordinary remark suggested pleas-
antly 

  lets lope a bit-itll rest you well
gallop over there and help the boys hold
the bunch while they cut out the calves
his horse leaped ahead and hers fol-
lowed but the gallop proved even a
keener torture than the trot for it dis-
covered a lot of new bruises

  when they reached the restless dusty
herd of cattle blair left her with a talka-
tive cowboy and rode in to help with the
cutting out

  youre sure a dandy rider compli-
mented the youth

  thanks said ruth shortly i feel
like a hospital of incurables

  why aint you rode much giggled
the boy

  all my life-from the way i feel
what time is it

  pretty near noon say if you throw
your leg over the saddle-horn and sit
sideways itll rest you

  good heavens im nearer a corpse
than an acrobat

  the boy howled with laughter at her
amazed expression but he noticed that
her lips were white and her hands trem-
bled

  say youre game all right he said
soberly  spose we start on slow and
when the boss is through he can catch
up with us and take you on home its
pretty near noon

  much obliged said ruth with real
gratitude but dont you tell him im
done out for ill ride back if it kills
me

  they had gone only a quarter of a
mile-and six whole ones stretched be-
tween them and home when blair gal-
io

the ladder of fame

loped up to them and dismissed the boy
with

  all right shorty they need you to
guard and she knew from his tone
that shorty should have remained where
he was

  we can trot home in less than an
hour so you wont be very late for din-
ner he assured her assuming that hun-
ger was the cause of her haste

  trot how they trotted

  i will get home i will get home
ruth kept repeating to herself blair
talked along easily and she said yes
or  or indeed according to the
inflections of his voice while her face
grew from scarlet to a yellowish white
under her wide hat

  a few minutes before one they reached
the ranch gate and blair swung from
the saddle to tie the horses ruth tried
to move her feet but they were solid
in the stirrups and when blair looked
up in surprise that she did not dismount
he saw for the first time the dull eyes
and white face

  if youll wait a minute longer she
said weakly but still game ill be dead
and fall off but i cant move my f-e-e-t
and for the first time in her twenty-
three years ruth fainted and tumbled
into the astonished blairs arms

  for a long second he surveyed her
with wide amazed eyes as she lay ut-
terly relaxed in his arms while his con-
fused mind gathered itself together
then his arms tightened and he carried
her quickly to the house muttering in
a puzzled voice

  why you plucky little devil

  thereafter deeply penitent for his
neglect and filled with admiration for
her pluck he took her riding as a favor
to no one but because he had decided he
wanted to marry her many an after-
noon found his cowboys sitting idle in
the corrals discussing the sanity of their
hard-headed boss while the boss him-
self regardless of cattle shipping rode
aimlessly around in the hills with ruth

  one glad sunny morning in the last
week of her visit they had been out for
a wild gallop over the hills and his eyes
were proud of her fine straight figure
her hair had loosened and fell over her

shoulders a tangled mass of dark gold
with the reins in her teeth she was trying
with determined fingers to make her few
remaining hairpins do their duty

   their horses trotted along quietly and
meadow larks sang from the fence posts

   you look just like a big sunflower
said blair slowly i cant bear to have
you go away ruth dont you think
you could stay out here always to keep
me rounded up

  he asked his question quizzically-
half humorously but his eyes were seri-
ous under the broad-rimmed stetson and
his horse started quickly at the sharp
prick of his spur

  do you mean that you want me to
marry you  she questioned smiling and
shading her eyes with her outspread palm
that she might sec him more plainly

  thats what i mean will you

  yes her tone was merely one of
quiet agreement but her eyes fell from
his and her lips trembled like those of
an eager yet frightened child he
laughed softly as he watched her

  im afraid your horse wont stand
while i kiss you he said regretfully

  i think ill be able to wait she
laughed back

   so do i-till we get to the next gate
j at the next gate she was lifted from
her horse and kissed thoroughly for sev-
 eral minutes

 i love you more than youll ever
know my girl he murmured how
ive wanted you you independent little
thing

  they walked along the brow of the
great hill and watched the early sunlight
deepen while their horses grazed on the
new grass

  will you marry me next month he
asked

   no not for several years she re-
plied quietly i have gone to school av
my life now i want to do something

   yes scornfully write books mrs
king said

  maybe dear if i can the voice
was so unusually gentle that blair put
his arms around her quickly and asked
her pardon for he scarcely knew what
the ruth that he had come to know
was not especially gentle
the ladder of fame



  girl dont you know that if you leave
me youll never come back he turned
her toward him that he might look down
into her glowing face and all the love of
a great-hearted man lay in his eyes so
that she was ashamed and could not
meet his gaze

  oh my dear i will come back i
love you and she put her arms up
around his neck and drew his lips down
to hers and her eyes were full of tears
because she knew that he was right and
her heart cried out for what he offered

  no little girl he said slowly
youre lying to me and you know it
we cant any of us live but one life
thats worth anything and weve got to
choose it without trying half a dozen oth-
ers first if its fame you want you
arent very likely to run across it out in
these hills youll have to pay the price
for that but if you want the things
thatll make you happy-youd better
take me girl

  she smiled up at him almost wistfully
and drew him down beside her on the
crest of the hill where they could watch
the horses as they grazed down the hill-
side

  what do you mean by price she
asked after a long silence and he hesi-
tated before he answered

  i dont know what yours would be-
but youre a poor girl and youll have
to pay one nothing comes to us for
nothing therere too many climbing be-
side you who have all the money they
want you know it ruth

  there could be  arguing with the flat
certainty of his voice and she was silent

  stay here dear he said gently
well be mighty happy if youll only
make up your mind to it

  do you mean that if i should try for
a few years-and fail that you wouldnt
want me

  ill always want you ruth he an-
swered her youre the first woman
ive ever asked to marry and i want you
mighty bad do you mind telling me if
im the first man with you

  she laughed why yes-would you
have cared any less if you werent
no-o he said slowly and then in his
straight simple words but im mighty

glad im the first one i suppose every
man wants to be first with the woman
he wants for his wife and some day for

the-

  oh dont she cried sharply with a
wave of curious shame at what he was
about to say and a hood of crimson in
her cheeks

  why girl he said softly i love
you and the words carried surprise
apology and explanation thats the
reason i want you now before you leave
me and risk the world ive thought
ever since i came to know you what a
fine big-hearted mother youd make for
a boy he whispered reverently and
oh girl i know what im talking about
youll never find a love thatll beat mine

  the same hurt crept up into her throat
that she had known once before but this
time it was from the heart of a mature
woman far out to the west where the
red-topped hills backed into the moun-
tains the sun was changing the dull peaks
into masses of living color and over her
swept a keen longing for the love and
honest simplicity in the life that this man
offered her she turned to him quickly
and her face was full of her love for
him so that his eyes gladdened as he
looked into hers

  oh my dear big man i do love you
she breathed and ill come to you in
the fall there im glad i decided
shall we go home to breakfast

  you bet you sweetheart he laughed
and caught her roughly in his arms she
put her slender hands softly against his
cheeks and kissed him

  ill love you always-always-al-
ways she whispered

  the mountains were purple in the dis-
tance  the man who held her was strong
limbed and tanned of face and the
world was full of meadow-lark songs
and the love of him and her

the third step

  the big automobile chugged along
restfully it was a very fine automobile
ruth leaned back against the soft cush-
ions and wondered how many thousands
of dollars it had cost

  the hair of the man beside her was
tinged with gray his face was strong
no

the ladder of fame

featured and tight lipped but ruths
hair still held its dark gold shadows and
her eyes were bright and exultant

  they were riding through quiet roads
walled with bloom that wound in and out
by ponds and parks lie owned the roads
but they led to her star which sparkled
with promise in the near distance for her
girlhood wagon of ambitions had nearly
finished its journeys several times it
had upset on the way but always she had
righted it and climbed in once again
and she had won

  the man beside her was a fit master
for her loftiest air castle and the big au-
tomobile was well on its way she felt
his keen eyes and turned to meet
them

  well-you got my note are you go-
ing to he asked writh a half smile of
amusement

yes-thank you i never dreamed
for a moment that you would ask me
he laughed heartily a thing so un-
usual that the chaffueur turned his head
in surprise

  it didnt occur to me that the delay
might worry you he told her adding-
after an almost imperceptible pause or
i would have asked you three months
ago

  oh no you would not she con-
tradicted calmly you would never
have asked me in the world if you had
not thought i might marry george blair
we will have to be perfectly frank
with each other you know-if we are
not to make a failure

  he settled back with a relieved shrug
of his shoulders but leaned forward to
ask with sincere curiosity

  you really dont love me one bit on
earth do you

  no candidly and since you dont
love me a bit either why should we pre-
tend anything about it

  youre right ive never seen such
absolute honesty as yours in my life and
it rather wilts me i can remember when
i thought -o-v-e spelled the whole
world

  i have some similar memories she
said lightly and i still think it does-
for some people

  oh yes so do i he affirmed care-

lessly depends  the size of their
world

  take us up to the cliff that overlooks
the house and grounds he told the
chauffeur and they rode on silently until
the great machine slowed down just at
the top of the cliff where they could
see plainly the massive house surrounded
by its beautiful gardens which was to be
her home and as she looked she
thought of another glad sunny morning
and a gallop over endless hills and a log
ranch house down among the cotton
woods and a little hurt crept into her
heart but her mind was proud and ex-
ultant

  kill it she heard him tell the man
ill drive back and you can take the
short cut to the lodge

  after the man had gone she leaned
back in the wide seat conscious of the
steady scrutiny of his eyes though her
own were fastened intently  the beauty
that lay below them

  my nose is altogether too large and
i am afraid to have that mole taken off
my cheek otherwise do i suit

  you do he answered gravely ig-
noring her jesting tone you are as i
told you in my letter exactly the woman
i want for my wife i was not sure of
it until i found i might lose you and
you-does it please you she followed
the direction of his eyes

  you mean-all this and she mo-
tioned out over the loveliness about them

  yes and incidentally-myself

  you know that i want to marry
you she returned frankly i can never
repay half that you offer me then
abruptly why did you send him
away 

  because i want to talk to you with-
out tempting his ears do you mind
telling me which of your moods has hold
of you at present

  an absolutely new one i cannot
vouch for its actions she answered
lightly but he detected an earnest note
underneath and noticed that the white
fingers lying  the seat between them
were tight against the cushions lie lift-
ed the hand gently kissed it and slipped
a great shining stone on the third finger

  you have a beautiful hand he said
the ladder of fame

hi

courteously straightening her fingers out
upon his palm

  and they smell like firecrackers
she murmured absently entirely uncon-
scious that she had thought aloud until
the words had escaped and his aston-
ished what brought a swift shamed
flush over her face for her mind had
leaped back to a girl in a checked ging-
ham dress whose untaught heart held a
world of happiness

  oh she stammered laughing and
he saw for a moment the sweet laugh-
ing face of her girlhood

  it made me think of something that
happened about a hundred years ago
she explained i suppose you think this
new mood of mine borders on insanity
no he laughed i was thinking that
i never saw you look at all like that be-
fore do you like the stone

  oh yes and she withdrew her hand
holding it up in the sunlight though
i cant think of anything to say but
thank you 

  it is sufficient that you will wear it
he said in his short manner and she
flushed curiously turning away while
he gave a quick glance at his watch i
must take the afternoon train for wash-
ington but we have over half an hour
here i wish you would take off your
hat-i like your hair

  obediently she loosened the long veil
and laid her hat on her lap fluffing the
thick hair from her forehead after an
instants hesitation she unearthed a pow-
der puff used it and settled back com-
fortably in her own corner

  i didnt suppose you knew whether it
was sky blue or chestnut she observed
drily but im glad you like it what
are we going to talk about-john her
lips showed themselves strangers to his
name and he smiled at the sound of it

  thanks ruth thats another thing
i like about you-your name i suppose
we can be perfectly frank with one an-
other now and i should like to know if
you are in love with anyone else

 i am not in love with anyoneshe
corrected and he accepted it with a quiet
amused glance

  thats good neither am i it puts
us on a better footing now this is

what i want to do i want you to put
on your play before we are married
now that were engaged i have a right
to back you openly and with the name
you already have and the virtue of the
thing itself it cant help but be a suc-
cess with plenty of money to start it
right

  you want to do this before we are
married 

  yes immediately

  so that more people will know whom
you are marrying the words were a
mere statement of fact judicially consid-
ered his lips tightened a trifle

  we both profess to enjoy honesty
he vindicated himself and ruth nodded
absently drawing in a short deep breath

  next to marrying you id rather see
it a success than anything on earth she
said bluntly and he took her words up
with a little gesture of displeasure

  ive wanted to tell you ruth that
you are not to feel-that is he stopped
for a more careful choice of words i
do not wish you to think that i am con-
ferring any favor upon you in making
you my wife i want you even in our
relations for the last three years i have
never found the least thing to criticise
in you and when we are married i shall
never in the least way make you regret
the trust you have placed in me in the
past i shall want you to go on with
your work nothing will help me more
than to have a wife who can climb with
me

  she glanced up at him curiously and
after a seconds silence asked did
you never love a woman very very
much 

  a swift flash of surprise swept his
straight hard features

  yes its been a good many years since
i have though but i loved one very
very much as you say

  was she at all like me

  sincere amusement colored his quick
sarcastic laugh

  she was totally devoid of intellect
was the sufficient answer it almost
killed me not to marry her because i
did love her so very very much but
even at that time i realized that i couldnt
afford to give up my chance at the big


the ladder of fame

things in life merely because of a wom-
an whom i enjoyed holding in my arms
i should have spent my life in a little
town kissing her and sitting in the dusk
with her evenings and buying a nickels
worth of candy for the children later
on

  yet those are the things that prove
strongest in my book-and you approve
it

  yes in the book itll take like wild
fire oh ive never forgotten jane he
went on carelessly i remember how i
used to sit in my office half the night
and fight with myself to give her up-
but i did it shes married now and has
three half-grown children your hair is
like hers but that is all

  he finished his sketch with a charac-
teristic gesture of dismissal but ruths
eyes were interested and rather puzzled

  you will not expect us to have chil-
dren will you she questioned in ex-
actly the same tone that might have asked
his wishes regarding the lighting of the
new library

  of course not there are plenty of
people to have children who have time
for them

  she knew that he expected her to say
something but she only raised her eyes
for an instant to his and let them stray
again to the great house far below them
she heard his watch case click

  yes in just a minute she said as
if in answer to a direct question i want
to tell you something

  it was a long minute-a long two min-
utes before she turned to him as he sat
silently awaiting the result of her
thoughts watching the wind flutter the
soft lace below her white round throat
and noting the deep gold shadows in her
hair it was always pleasant to look at
ruth his expression changed as he
watched her but it was not love that
sprang to his eyes only a common
coarser thing that lights easily in the
eyes of men and which veiled itself
instantly in a look of concern when she
straightened and turned to him

  what is it ruth he questioned
quickly an undercurrent of surprise in
his voice for her face had changed en-
tirely and all the exulting pride had gone

from it he had not dreamed that this
woman of laughter and stern purpose
could look so like a hurt child uncon-
sciously his hand reached out and cov-
ered hers

  what is it ruth he asked again

  i have not been honest at all she
said simply i have lied to you all the
time and he would have smiled but for
the keen pain in her voice which made
him ask hesitatingly

  do you mean-that there are other
men 

  she grew very red--a hard deep red
that crept from her face down under the
soft lace at her throat and lingered long
after his quick apology

  no she said at last not as you have
been and the hard little expression had
gathered again around the corners of her
mouth she straightened tensely and
stared straight out ahead her words fol-
lowing quick upon each other

  i do love someone else with all my
heart you think i chose your name
and wealth ahead of all other things-
i wanted you to think so but i didnt
i wanted to go with him

  may i ask why you didnt then and
the annoyance almost covered the sur-
prise in his tones he had asked her to
marry him partly because she was not
given to climaxes

  he didnt want me she said in a
flat hard voice i had promised to go
with him when your letter came but he
didnt want me-when id told him
the man beside her sat up suddenly
and leaned toward her

  great cjesar did you tell him about
us he demanded but she paid him no
heed

  and then i knew how badly i wanted
what id missed i know now that were
all alike-we women if we overcome
our instincts we have to fight them down
and-and it isnt easy i wanted to go
way out there with him and plant flowers
and make table-cloths and white curtains
and ride over the hills in the morning
again and after while-to have a little
baby-but he didnt want me

  what did you tell him

  the truth-that you had had given
me money for three years
the intercession of madame



  the mans inscrutable expression did
not change but he looked away from her
face which was as some dead thing after
the buoyant life that usually covered it
lie cleared his throat

  he must be a narrow-minded cad
he said at last contemptuously

  oh no he isnt she said wearily
he was right-i know it but he loves
me i know that too he said i would-
would be ashamed before my own chil-
dren and he was right her voice fell
to a whisper full of humiliation i
could never bear it to know what i had
done when i held my little baby in my
arms

  he was silent his face still turned
from her and she laid her hand on his
arm but he did not move

  i had to tell you she said finally in

a matter-of-fact voice pulling on her
gloves if you do not want me know-
ing these things it will be best for both
of us if you will simply say so

  then he turned and for a mere second
her eyes looked straight into his and
saw there sincerity respect and admira-
tion

  of course i want you he said
gravely it is one of the strongest de-
sires of my life that you should be
happy

  i know we will be very happy-al-
ways was the low-spoken promise even
as she had promised the two men who
had loved her

  so they rode down through the road-
way of blossoms into the land of her
dreams as it lay before them full of
the morning sunshine

ees obrie will you not
be so kind as to repeat
that again it goes too
slow much

 antoinette obrie flushed and pulled
herself together at madames reproof
for underneath the ladys polite request
the accompanist detected latent sarcasm
after which she played with more ani-
mation until the singing pupil had fin-
ished

 now mees began madame en-
dourd when the two were alone you
and  must come to one understanding
-you are too preoccupied much you
of late play very bad accompaniments
you drag-drag gazing are you always
through the window and for the sound
of the doorbell do you listen already
have i lost one two pupil  your ac-
count of that am i sure mees you
lack entirely interest helas but one
changed girl you have become never
used you to be so careless your ac-
companiments once they were full of
life and fire now no an contraire et
pourquoi because mees too much in
love are you with mr petaire villard

do i not pay you and well hey for
services if i more scholars should lose
where will come money for me and my
child leontine with which to buy bread
you mees must improve or it will be
for us to part

  antoinette gazed tentatively at her
friend and patron whose black eyes flash-
ed and who spoke rapidly madame was
angry else why should she have ad-
dressed her so formally laying her
head on the music rack of the piano
the accompanist burst into a torrent of
tears

  oh madame she sobbed brokenly
t am so wretchedly unhappy-i wish i
were dead

  of course why not ejaculated
madame stamping her little foot so
too would i be had i a big fat mr
petaire for five years hanging around
me and too lazy and proud to work and
make me his wife hah is he a man
he say he adore you tres bien then
why do he not go to work and get
money because it is for the shoe of
a dead man he waits out i have
much disgust if he so love you and so

conductor or motaireman hey
when excited madame spoke broken
english interlarded with her native
french when first mr petaire asked
you to wait for him he tell you he can-
not yet announce his engagement pour-
quoi on account of his mamma she
too aristocratic is to let her son make a
misalliance tres bien then god was
good behold mamma gets much ill-
ness and die voila docs then he ac-
knowledge you as his fiancee non
pourquoi he now has to live with his
papa who is alone and who is old and
his care desires and papa will not go
contraire to madame la meres wishes
am i not correct non he prefers not
to marry because mr petaire obtains
from his papa a big allowance and for
even you antoinette he will not of his
comforts be deprived so for the money
that he should earn behold he lets you
work and because for five years he pay
you attention he lets your friends criti-
cise and scandal you and they believe
not that he means to marry they say
for why does she go with him alway and
he allows you to be compromised yet
he say he loves you bah let not my
daughter meet and love one man who
to the upper class belongs but one who
for her will work and who to her gives
honest love

  oh madame sobbed the girl i
thought you liked peter you call him
fat and ridicule now but you are always
nice to him and doesnt he take singing
lessons to help you

  oui ma chere and do i not take
him for one-half price and do i not
give him one long hours instruction 
itourquoi done does he not use my
house for five years as a rendezvous to
meet you mees  bah know now that
i am not quite so big fool i know when
it is to be used i am mr petaire takes
me and leontine automobiling true
and in the summer he invites us at hotels
to be his guest true mais who else
would go as chaperon with you to hotels
hey non i am one convenient acces-
sory madame endourd plays chaperon
because antoinettes mamma left her
daughter in anger because of her and

mr petaires actions and well you
know it i like not these all time bluffs
non certainement i think to marry you
he intends some day but helas already
is your hair turning gray already to
read your notes you have to wear glasses
will he wait until your teeth become a
bridge  and with rheumatism will your
hands become big and your knuckles
enlarge why can he not at least your
engagement announce and take you to
see papa at the madison avenue house
hey alors my temper have i lost i
apologize-but it is in future to play
with more expression i desire think
not of mr petaire when you my pupils
accompany or i shall engage mr koh-
ler in your place understand i dis-
like not mr petaire he is to me most
agreeable and polite and a gentleman
but he is lazy with a clean suit and
a broom would i sweep the streets to
marry a woman i loved i would not
take my papas money but i would be
one man and work mr petaire is over
forty he is ashamed of himself i
think but cease to weep it is of your
own affaire-not mine and the impul-
sive frenchwoman kissed her friend
with affection

  madame emil endourd was a widow
with one daughter who at present was
in a convent madame had been edu-
cated for the operatic stage but failing
had turned to voice culture leasing
a small house on the east side she had
sublet enough rooms to meet her rent
while from her teaching she derived
enough income to support herself and
leontine in comfort miss obrie had
answered madames advertisement and
had become her accompanist

  miss obrie was thirty-five years old
she had a wealth of auburn hair dark
eyes and pretty features madame who
was nearing forty was a bright viva-
cious brunette and was like a sister to
the girl for she loved her the affair
between peter villard and antoinette
obrie was the old story of a rich mans
son and a self-supporting woman

  from his father for years he had re-
ceived a liberal income-never in his life
had he earned enough to pay his club
dues although he had graduated from
the intercession of madame

a law school he attended to his par-
ents pleasures he had been his
mothers escort to the opera where they
always had subscription seats and after
her death he went about with his father

  peter was quite stout with a perfectly
round face pale blue eyes and iron-gray
hair his skin was swarthy and mottled
as madame expressed it peters face
reminded her of a round huckleberry
pie where in places the juice had run
through the upper crust

  when younger he had been engaged
to a distant relative a miss de peyster
but owing to his laziness in failing to
secure an income by working she broke
the engagement and married another to
the intense disappointment of mamma
villard who had above all things de-
sired that her son should wed a de pey-
ster peter belonged to several clubs
where on certain occasions he had com-
posed and delivered very creditable
speeches he wrote impossible odes and
sonnets and was a general favorite al-
though everyone criticised him music
was his passion and it was antoinettes
wonderful musical talent that first at-
tracted and afterward won peter she
played at musicales and had composed
several admirable songs and it was she
who persuaded peter to become one of
madames pupils

  old peter villard was an autocrat
whose word was law he was tall wiry
and aristocratic looking and although
nearing eighty was as active as a man
of sixty his hair was white and his
dark eyes seemed to read ones very soul

  before his mothers death the news
of peters entanglement as old villard
termed it had reached his parents ears
whereupon mrs villard changed her
will leaving her husband the money she
had intended giving peter thereby mak-
ing him absolutely dependent upon his
father-then she extracted from him a
promise never to marry during her life-
time after she died her husband who
was intensely selfish refused to enter-
tain even a thought of his sons marry-
ing he loved his boy his comfort and
his money too well to part with them
during his lifetime

  peter my son he would observe as

he sipped his burgundy you arc the
last and sole representative of an old
and aristocratic knickerbocker family
you come of honorable stock on both
sides wouldnt you wish to say to
your son what i am now saying to you

  why yes replied peter doubtfully
why

  because you must marry a woman
who speaks our language peter one who
is your equal socially now dont at-
tempt to say i am prejudiced and all
that for im not this woman whom
gossips couple with your name is a mu-
sical genius you love music you in-
herit that from me its her music that
has fascinated you not the woman
why shes old-nearly forty shell be
in her dotage when you are my age
your head is turned you should marry
a young woman cut it out my boy
and youll soon forget her shell be
happier with a musician for a husband
-a fiddler or an organist-one of her
own class and shell soon become con-
soled-but you-noblesse oblige you
belong to another world and it is from
that world you must select and marry
a wife where did miss-whats her
name-come from who were her
father and her mother do you know
aught of her antecedents

  yes father i do replied peter
they are french mr obrie went
through the civil war and his wife gets
a pension antoinette has supported
herself since she was seventeen at
present mrs obrie is away on a visit
and her daughter has an elderly friend
staying in her flat

  i shouldnt think that at her age
she needed a chaperon said old villard
grimly it makes it convenient for you
having her mother absent hey how
does she feel about your attentions to
her daughter

  peter vouchsafed no reply as a
matter of fact the mother disgusted
with it all and not being able to influ-
ence the girl had left her to her fate
sooner than stay and behold her being
compromised by the man

  and this frenchwoman her friend
is she respectable asked the elder
peter
ii	the intercession of madame

 then peter told of madame and of
her struggle for support since her hus-
bands death

  emil endourd was a wonderful lead-
er and composer and madame is a brick
father besides shes been an angel to us
i never knew such a friend

  humph  doubtless shes clever why
being a rich mans son were you to
marry the girl this madame would be
benefited socially of course theres
the cause in a nutshell peter youre
up against a hard problem ill take
you for a trip around the world if youre
afraid to stay and break off with her
but youd better do it at once

  father if only youd seen antoinette
youd love her shed be like a daughter
to you

  nonsense ejaculated old villard
looking disgusted drop all that daugh-
ter business if you please ill select
one of my own equals for my daughter
-she shows her lack of pride when she
allows you to dangle around her as you
have done for five years if you love
her so why dont you hustle and make
a living

  peter grew mottled

  youve never worked nor earned a
dollar where would you be without
the allowance i give you every month
youre too old to begin at the foot of
the ladder well if you persist in mar-
rying her during my lifetime thats
what youll do not a penny goes to
you and you cant break my will either
for before i die i can give away every-
thing i possess are you ready to prom-
ise to wait for the woman until after
my death 

  yes father faltered peter

  very well then youll get all thats
coming to you i shant care for ill
not be alive to see and suffer the dis-
grace of my only sons marriage to a
miss nobody from nowhere and with
a motion of finality he arose id like
the full name of this girls father and
what occupation he followed while liv-

ing

  his name answered peter was
jerome obrie-they lived in a town near
albany they are french although an-
toinette was born in this country pe-

ters face was dark and angry looking
while upon his cheeks there appeared
purple patches father he faltered
if i obey your wishes may i not an-
nounce our engagement  antoinette
will abide by your decision but wont
you ask her here and meet her at
least i owe her something id like to
show people that im not such a black-
guard as they suppose mr to be for
she has been compromised by my atten-
tions and im not such a cad as not
to be ashamed but im powerless you
never brought me up to work worse
luck ive been a lackey to you and
mother ever since i left college and
peters eyes filled with unshed tears
which he quickly wiped away

  old villard loved his son and could
not but see that he was right

  there dont take it to heart my
boy perhaps the conditions imposed
may be too strenuous under the cir-
cumstances ill meet you halfway in
this promise you may bring your fi-
ancee here ill invite the relatives to
dinner and announce your engagement
that will quiet mrs grundy but ill
enjoy seeing your aunts and cousins
squirm when i do it and the joke is
they consider you a non-marrying cousin
who will leave them the villard mil-
lions whereupon the gentleman went
off into a fit of laughter nearly causing
him to choke but he continued after
catching his breath remember no wed-
ding bells for that young woman and
you until after papas demise and he
chuckled as he left the room

 the two women were overjoyed at
peters news madame loaned the girl
her finest laces and prettiest jewels she
even combed and arranged antoinettes
heavy hair most becomingly first ap-
pearances count much she declared

  oh tiortense said the girl kissing
madame impulsively you shall live
with us when i am mistress of that
house and she gazed at herself gowned
in one of madames french costumes
we shall never forget all of your good-
ness and friendship we can never be-
gin to repay you madame was genu-
inely delighted and sat up until an-
toinette returned from the dinner party
the intercession of madame

ii 

  oh hortense cried the girl as she
stood while madame unhooked her gown
it was simply lovely mr villard is
a dear he actually kissed me and he

seated me upon his right-and then-

the girl was wild with excitement and
her eyes shone-then during the sec-
ond course what do you think he
announced our engagement and every-
one drank our health oh dont they
love me i guess not i responded in
a master-like way to every toast peter
said he was proud of me you know
ive been studying toasts to be ready
for this occasion i know old mr vil-
lard likes me i impressed him no
doubt just wait ill be mistress there
yet before the old gentleman realizes
it ill make him release peter from
that promise and what else do you
think peter says-an account of the din-
ner and the announcement of our en-
gagement will be in every paper and
the girl danced around the room

  you are fortunate replied madame
you have my sincere congratulates
but you go now to bed it is early i
have to arise tomorrow and work i am
tired

  during the dinner old mr villard
had studied his sons fiancee carefully
he was a keen observer and read char-
acter well but he had not decided for
or against the girl until she had so
cleverly acquitted herself and after
she had played so charmingly then
he said to himself she will not dis-
grace us

  dont you think her beautiful  asked
peter proudly

  well answered his father she
might be so considered if when she
laughed she showed only her pretty teeth
but she shows above and it spoils her
mouth its a pity but shes as smart
as the devil and can hold her own
against the entire family although
theres a certain something about her
that jars me unpleasantly her envi-
ronments may have had something to do
with it and when shes your wife it may
disappear

  antoinette now spent the greater part
of her time at the villards madame
had accepted several invitations and was

charmed with peters papa as she
termed him for hours antoinette would
accompany peter while he sang then
she would play until the old gentleman
slept after which the lovers would talk
in whispers many were the tales she
told of her ancestors especially after a
few glasses of champagne drunk a din-
ner the old gentleman would smile
grimly as he listened and take them with
a grain of salt she now felt sure that
her future was assured the motor
stood before madames door half of the
time twice a week found the lovers at
the opera and often they invited ma-
dame the girl was the recipient of
lovely gifts from the old gentleman who
invited her to accompany him on shop-
ping trips and consulted her regarding
dinners and musicales for now the vil-
lard mansion had opened its doors once
more and antoinette felt herself almost
its mistress

  she read to him played for him and
threw the soft light of her pretty eyes
upon him as she had often done when
peters allegiance had shown symptoms
of wavering she played chess and
dominoes night after night she sat at
dummy bridge until she could sit no
longer but to peter junior there came
no sign of the fathers relenting ma-
dame in a tactful manner would praise
antoinette her capabilities her beauty
and ability but mr villard would only
give her a quizzical look

  its useless cried the girl one night
this will go on until i wear caps hor-
tense  and she began to sob theres
no sign of his weakening hes like a
mule i am as unhappy as i was be-
fore i met him

  thats foolish her friend replied
to him everything comes who waits
hey then she reminded the girl of
her improved condition and reproached
her for worrying be patient she said
and see meanwhile the girl had be-
gun quietly to cut many of her former
friends so sure was she of her new po-
sition

  oh hortense she exclaimed one
day suppose father villard should live
to be ninety no man will marry me
then i shall become insane if this goes
n

the intercession of madame

on much longer the strain is telling on
me

  madame had been a stanch friend
when before the engagement was an-
nounced she had repudiated indignantly
the insinuations of gossiping friends
thereby losing pupils

  wont you go with us madame on
a trip to the white mountains asked
peter one day it will do both you and
leontine good then you might when
alone intercede for us with father he
thinks you so intelligent and clever
yes interrupted antoinette when
you get him alone some evening on the
porch if you plead our cause real hard
hortense im sure hell weaken

  madame consented would it not bene-
fit her child the trip though she her-
self might have to do some disagreeable
work so they went and the change
made her feel younger they stopped
at a large and well-known hotel and
everything went harmoniously

  one afternoon leontine asked her
mother to take a walk through the woods
nearby and sitting on the trunk of a
fallen tree the girl began to weep

  what is it ma cherie asked ma-
dame kissing her tell mamma
oh cried the girl theyre using
you  peter and antoinette i overheard
them talking i was in the hammock
and it was dark i couldnt tell you be-
fore for i knew this place would do
you so much good but i cannot keep it
longer mamma you are to be dropped
after you get mr villards consent to
their marriage antoinette is a cat she
saysto peter of course then our po-
sition in society will not admit of our
having a singing teacher for a friend
and peter says by george youre
right but ill do the square thing by
madame shes been the bulliest friend
a couple ever had say weve used her
for five years think of it

   yes replies antoinette but shes
been well repaid why think of the
operas weve taken her to and the pleas-
ure she has derived from our auto and
the little trips that she has gone on with
us even dragging along leontine oh
dont worry about her you can send
her a present now and then but so far

as i am concerned she must be dropped
i consider her most undesirable shes
a semi-bohemian

   yes but says peter shes lost
scholars on account of our being at her
house

   nonsense replies antoinette thats
what she says theyd have probably
gone anyway i consider her very me-
diocre as a teacher

  so mamma continued the girl i
thought it best to tell you lets leave
here at once you are to be turned
down for peters wealthy friends i feel
so indignant i could murder them-you
who have been so true and noble for
them to dare to do such a thing

  patience replied madame while a
bright spot glowed on either cheek i
have made one promise it was for that
i was brought here cherie i with papa
villard have to intercede for them that
they may marry then forever shall i
go out of their life and madame softly
wept you know leontine she said
huskily pressing the girls hand to her
own heart mamma nevare breaks a
promise-but trust mamma

  when alone she soliloquized for five
years have i my drawing-room allowed
them to use for five years have i shield-
ed antoinette obrie from scandal that
people not think her one bad woman
many friends and pupils have i lost 
her account and now after making it
possible for them to meet in a respect-
able way how have i been treated by
her who will soon be a beggar on a
horse always have i had to be bored
with their troubles why have i not
seen-why have i been so used-because
it is one tender heart i have and taking
emils locket from her heart madame
kissed it and gazing at it tentatively
wiped her eyes

  but like a woman of honor that night
she kept her word while the couple were
dancing she walked the long porch with
old mr villard then sitting beside him
in a dimly lighted corner she interceded
for the lovers with all her might

  it is one crime my dear sir she
said and it is with hatred that thev
will your memory regard people will
say that you are one selfish person an-
the intercession of madame



toinette is lovely she will bring the sun
into your house and you will feel never
lonely who knows but leetle grand-
children may climb upon your knees and
make your life happy and so forth
and so forth-

  the following day they left madame
though quiet showed  sign of anger
when home again she informed them
that she had done her very best and
thought that she had won the two
nearly overpowered her with expressions
of everlasting gratitude and thanks
which she knew to be false

  i have with fat mr petaire  more
sympathy she said to leontine after
the lovers had gone he is one lazy
man and will not work no he prefers
to wait for the shoe of the dead-beware
always of such love my child

  the following day peter and an-
toinette attended the yale games at new
haven leaving papa to take a short mo-
tor ride with madame and leontine re-
turning to mr villards house where
they were to dine madame while in
the act of removing her hat turned and
who should walk into the drawing-room
but mrs obrie who had upon reading
a new york paper seen notice of her
daughters engagement and hastened to
the city finding  one in the flat she
sought madames from thence to the
villards house thinking sure to find her
there madame quietly introduced her
to mr villard who at once politely bade
her to be seated gazing at the woman
he seemed surprised for in truth she
was most ordinary she was dark with
overhanging brows keen gray ees and
a most unpleasant expression and per-
sonality

  sir she began i have returned to
my disobedient daughter-my head-
strong little girl t have never approved
of the way peter villard treated her and
as she refused to listen to advice i left
her and refused to live under the same
roof youre of age i says to her
and you cant see further than the end
of your nose youll go to the dogs
but i shant be here to see you go yes
sir thats what i says and ill light
out before you disgrace me of course
now its all different and im back shes

worked hard has my girl since she was
sixteen her pa and i spent a pile of
money on her music and bought her a
piano people said she had great talent
and so she had she played at dancing
school twice a week and at peoples
houses at afternoon teas and card clubs
but she was dead set to come to new
york and come she would i had to
sell the little place that my poor jerry
had worked like a dog to get i hated
to part with it

  madam what was your husbands
name asked mr villard wiping his
eye-glasses and gazing furtively at ma-
dame endourd

  jerome obrien sir of amsterdam
new york after goin through the war
jerry took up his old trade he was a
carpenter and a good one too but before

ann was born-

  obrien i think you said interrupt-
ed mr villard why i supposed your
name to be obrie

  oh thats anns nonsense replied
the woman with a sheepish laugh she
said to say we was french was more
swell and would be better for her every
way i give in to her and let it go but
laws why jerry obrien sir why hed
rise in his grave and swear if he thought
ann was ashamed of her good irish
blood why even madame here who
has been her best friend never knew it
did you madame addressing the lady
who wonderingly shook her head at the
way the girl had deceived her

  yes sir her name is ann obrien
named for the blessed st ann and her
fathers name god rest his soul was
jerome patrick obrien both named for
the saints sir he was a good man and
went by the name of honest jerry-
i dont know wherever ann comes by
her silly airs

  but you madam asked the old gen-
tleman is there no french in you
not a bit sir french is it she
laughed if you please i am as irish
as galway can make me-but we settled
here before ann was born i lost my
first sir

  madame went quietly over and sat
beside mr villard the shock had been
unexpected and he seemed appalled


the intercession of madame

  mrs obrien he resumed after col-
lecting himself remove your hat and
dine with us leontine my child kindly
touch the button dinner for four simp-
son he said to the man and serve it
at once

  then he politely seated madame en-
dourd opposite himself and leontine on
his right under the influence of the
wine mrs obriens tongue loosened
and she regaled them with anns entire
life from the cradle when the third
course was about to be served the lovers
appeared peter junior seemed out of
sorts over something and his face was
cloudy when antoinette beheld her
mother she nearly fainted but cleverly
controlled herself and greeted the loqua-
cious lady with effusion she feared lest
the old gentleman might think her
ashamed of her mother and despise her
for it and she was at present building
character with that august personage

  madame endourd you are evidently
unaware that you are occupying my
mothers seat we have always kept it
sacred my father perhaps has failed to
realize it said peter most impolitely
with a scowl

  peter interrupted the old gentle-
man sternly while an angry flush ap-
peared on his face i beg to tell you
that i did realize it but it was i who
put her in that place henceforth it is
to be her seat understand  and cross-
ing over to madame he put both hands
on her shoulders saying this after-
noon the lady sitting here has made me
the happiest of men for she has become
my wife and the head of my establish-
ment while this little girl smiling at
leontine will be as my own daughter
simpson two more plates for mr peter
and miss obrien

  antoinette held on to the chair white
to the lips did he say obrien or had
she heard incorrectly peter sat down
heavily in a chair as though stunned and
groaned aloud then he buried his head
in his hands

  they glared at madame not daring
to speak lest they should incur the wrath
of the old gentleman who still stood
beside his new wife with his hands on
her shoulders

  you understand what i said i pre-
sume although you take my announce-
ment rather ungraciously it appears
for one hour this lady pleaded for you-
that i might consent to your marriage
i told her that upon one condition only
would i give it and that was that she
should take the place of my son and
i compelled her to marry me to-day so
that i might withdraw my objections to
your marriage thus making you happy

  the color slowly returned to an-
toinettes cheeks true her mother had
told all-their true name included-still
it would blow over and she could easily
obtain the old gentlemans forgiveness
through madame who loved her after
all she had committed no crime but
would peter despise her peters face
was set and covered with black and blue
spots while he was exceedingly angry
that he was obliged to be agreeable

  after each one took his seat and the
butler had discreetly withdrawn mr
villard arose and said

  my son i release you from the prom-
ise made to me you may marry miss
ann obrien but you will be obliged to
work and support her you must now
begin and earn money some of my
friends will give you a position you
will have to rise early and be in busi-
ness at eight-thirty it is right that you
should begin to have some responsibili-
ties and if possible show yourself to be
a man this girl loves you yes for
five long years she has waited to become
your wife to her i shall make a mod-
erate allowance but to you none-
what you inherit at my death depends
largely upon what you amount to during
the rest of my life and particularly up-
on the respect shown by both of you to
my wife who has been a true and loyal
friend

  i shall at once announce the date of
your marriage it shall take place here
and i will present ann with her trous-
seau  then i would advise you to hire a
modest little flat within your means i
hope you will work and show the world
of what mettle you are made you may
be a rich man before i die who knows
peter give your arm to mrs obrien-
coffee will be served in the library
the wedding rings of mary alline

by henry p dowst

it is the rule at st susans to give
each discharged patient four dol-
lars mary alline accepted this bo-
nus without visible enthusiasm al-
though she was as grateful as her
strength permitted she said her good-
bys numbly while the matron patted her
thin-bladed shoulder helped her to but-
ton her dinky little spring weight jacket
and gently admonished her

  be a good girl mary write us how
you get along dear

  aint she the good soul thought
mary to herself going down the wide
granite steps and along the brick walk
to the street

  it was windy and cold and the streets
were icy mary alline hitched the little
bundle in her arms an inch or two higher
supporting it on her left arm she parted
the blanket that wrapped it and peered
nervously inside a faint and petulant
sound filtered out

   s all right kiddo cooed mary soft-
ly doncher care love s all right
she closed the slit in the blanket and
patted the bundle

  freeze r smother i dunno which
she murmured i hope to god i dont
take a tumble

  it was maybe ten blocks from st su-
sans to the home marys baby was
three weeks old and mary wasnt quite
strong she was a big-framed girl and
had been plump but now she could feel
the two two-dollar bills in a little bundle
with the note from the matron that
would entitle her to a fortnights stay
at the home slipping down and down
inside the stocking that was not tight
enough to hold them in place

  mary trudged bravely along main
street through the crowds of shoppers
she patted the little blanketed bundle
but had no extra breath for words to
comfort the baby who wailed vaguely
when she came to plater brothers jew-

elry shop she pushed through the door
and dropped down half exhausted on a
stool

 gee thats some walk she gasped
 slippery too

 she waited patiently for her breath
 and a floorwalker the latter came a
 little ahead

 well madam he said is there any-
 thing to-day

 there is said mary which is
 the rings 

 last counter on the right

 she got to her feet and followed the
 direction of his comprehensive gesture
 she stopped at the last counter on the
 right and gazed critically into the case
 while a saleswoman waited

 how much are those asked the
 girl presently

 do you mean these the woman
 queried indicating a tray

 nom the next one mary said

 the saleswoman lifted the tray and
 set it out before mary on the glass

 these are wedding rings she vol-
 unteered

 mary picked one up tentatively

 i know she said how much 
 the saleswoman plucked in some con-
 fusion at the little tag

 that is fourteen carat gold-five
 seventy-five

 havent you got somethin cheaper-
 real cheap the girl asked

 only in plated goods like these
 the saleswoman brought up another tray
 and mary picked up one of the rings

 that one said her informant is
 a dollar forty

 i guess thats nearer mary said
 ill take it 

 but the size interposed the sales-
 woman she became slightly ill at ease
 mary looked into her eyes and found
 the thing she expected to see there her
 own eyes hardened a very little but she


the wedding rings of mary alline

 could feel the slow flush beginning at
 her throat and pulsing upward the
 saleswomans embarrassment increased
 she said

  what size do you-does your friend
wear

  mary advanced her left hand steady-
ing her baby with her right she held
her level eyes gravely upon the sales-
womans face then smiled faintly

  quit kiddin  she said

  mary was very weary when she ar-
rived at the home and they put her
to bed when she awoke a girl in a non-
descript uniform took her temperature
and then brought her some light food
after that the girl sat down by her bed
and asked her a long string of questions
writing the answers on a big blank
mary gave them in the main truthfully
there was  sentiment in these queries
either in their form or in the manner of
their asking the girl in the uniform
was quiet business-like matter-of-fact
she thanked mary gravely bade her
good-night and turned down the lights

  mary found out in the morning that
the home was comfortable clean and
well ordered there were rules enforced
without flexibility there were no
wasted sentimentalities she had two
weeks residence guaranteed her there
unless she should find employment soon-
er she was told that she was fortu-
nate for many were waiting for the place
she would vacate but only one would
be accepted

  fortunate she brooded fortu-
nate my god

  she saw her baby every day and
learned to bathe him and dress him in
the coarse clean little garments the
home provided after the first week
she cared for him altogether day and
night the home matron told mary she
could offer him for adoption with a fair
chance of his being taken into a good
family

  mary submerged in a big wave of
fear held the little thing close and cried

  not much i wont what my baby
i should say not

  when she had been at the home ten
days mary was offered a job it was

in domestic service she was told she
had no choice of refusal because one of
the rules of the ilome said that an
inmate able to work must take the first
available place if offered by respectable
people her baby they said they would
keep in the nursery department for a
while and mary was to pay two dollars
a week for his board that was all there
was to it so she went to work not un-
cheerfully at four dollars a week

  mary had been a mill girl and knew
little of housework she wished she
could go back to the mills but it hap-
pened just then that they were shut down
for a period of repairs and-well may-
be she wouldnt have gone back anyhow
she applied herself courageously to her
unaccustomed tasks she was big and
strong and wholesome she did gen-
eral housework and the people with
whom she lived decided that she was
better than  girl at alland she
seemed to be willing they too were
willing-more than willing-that she
should sweep and clean and scrub and
cook as fast as she could learn at first
mrs bennett her employer haunted the
kitchen and tagged her up and down
stairs showing her how after a
while these attentions diminished mrs
bennett said she thought she was doing
very well to put up with a green girl
and help her to an education in do-
mestic science she made it clear to
mary that she was being kind to her

  once a week the girl had an afternoon
off to go and see her baby mrs ben-
nett decided that for the present at least
a girl of marys antecedents ought not
to go out evenings mary was sure she
had never had any relatives of that name
but she felt that she wasnt in a position
to contradict mrs bennett she kept
on with her sweeping and cleaning and
scrubbing and cooking and as her will-
ingness became more and more apparent
so did that of mrs bennett sometimes
mary broke a dish and mrs bennett
took its value or what she estimated to
be its value out of marys wrages mrs
bennett was a very charitable conscien-
tious person as mary fully appreciated

  mary usually got her work all done
by ten oclock and was free to retire
the wedding rings of mary alline



she climbed the third floor stairs to her
luxuriously appointed chamber and went
to bed on an iron cot with a straw mat-
tress sometimes  hot nights-and in
marys room the nights were hotter than
they were anywhere else-she would lie
awake for hours thinking about her
baby and wondering and wondering
unconsciously she would twist her dol-
lar-and-forty-ccnt ring round and round
and round until shortly it became quite
naked of its gold filling and created its
own shadow in greenish black on her
finger

  early in the summer mrs bennett re-
sumed taking ice a practice suspended
every autumn then it was that big
john came into marys life every other
morning he came to the back door and
called

  hey anny ice

  to this mary would reply

  aw gwan yer ice melts or some-
thing equally clever based on badinage
her acquaintance with big john devel-
oped into a rollicking friendliness he
used to stand  the back porch and
mop his forehead while mary brought
him a tin dipper of ice water which he
drained in great gulps like a thirsty
horse

  one day he noted the ring on marys
large red hand

  gee kid he exclaimed you aint
married

  mary jumped and her face went
ruddy she made a quick recovery and
came back sharply

  who says i aint she demanded
with asperity involuntarily she thrust
the tell-tale member under her apron

  well say wheres the ol man

  nunnayerbusiness snapped mary
and shut the door in his face so abruptly
that the tin dipper went rattling down
the steps

  later however she allowed big john
to become confirmed in the opinion
that she was a widow he muttered
huskily

  tough luck kid and went on his
perspiring way

  one day late in the autumn big john
broke the usual procedure of their rep-
artee with an announcement

  say mary you know the folks that
live along this here street aint gonna
take no ice much longer

  it was in order for mary to assume an
air of purported delight

  good riddance she said politely
aw come off now said big john
aint you sorry honest

  mary relented measurably

youre not so worse she conceded
sure i aint he urged say kid
dont you ever go out evenins none
how about a pitcher-show to-night
huh

  i wouldnt care about it she an-
swered uneasily

  i bet you would now persisted the
man i bet that dame wont let you
thats what

  he looked at her with a peculiar newly
awakened hungry light in his round
stubbly face then he blurted 

  this aint no place for you mary girl
honest that old dame would drive any-
one to drink looky-here kid what do
you say to blowin this job lets you

an me get mar-

  and just then a voice from the top of
the back stairs came pitching down im-
patient fretful grating

  may-ree may-ree arent you
coming up to finish your chamber work
this whole morningf

  mary alline slammed the screen door
and dashed panic-stricken up the stairs
but as she vanished she turned and blew
a kiss at big john standing open-
mouthed on the porch almost instantly
she heard him thumping off down the
walk whistling a shrill and discordant
rag-time tune that continued intermit-
tently and with diminishing volume as
his duties took him further and further
along his route

  mrs bennett harassed mary all that
day with obviously invented tasks and
worse than that she seemed never to
take her suspicious searching eyes from
the girls disturbed face toward night
she suddenly opened fire

  mary she said what was that ice-
man saying to you this morning when i
called you

  mary was not wholly unprepared for
the question yet it startled her


the wedding rings of mary alline

  nothin she replied voicing a hint
of defiance

  mrs bennett bridled it became plain
to mary that the woman had been mak-
ing up her mind all day to have it out
and there was no escape so she held
her tongue and listened wearily while
mrs bennett reviewed the details of her
own great kindness and charity during
the past months

  and now mary she went on if
you leave me to get married itll be a
nice return for all ive done for you i
dont accuse you of it mary but just
let me warn you that if you havent got
the common gratitude and loyalty-

  she stopped short mary looked up
there was a glint in mrs bennetts eyes
that mary understood

  oh mrs bennett she cried you
couldnt do that-you wouldnt you
wouldnt you wouldnt havent i been
a good girl havent i been-

  mrs bennett smiled a cool mirthless
triumphant smile there is a certain
charity that upon occasion makes its
beneficiaries its victims she went away
into the front of the house that night
mary alline lay awake many hours
thinking and thinking turning the wed-
ding-ring round and round in the dark
until it felt like a band of red-hot iron

  big john made his accustomed call on
his regular day mary managed to be
above stairs at the time on the suc-
ceeding day she mustered courage for
her usual bantering sally but there was
no need big john came washed and
brushed the ice lugged it into the back
hallway and dumped it in the refrig-
erator not once did he lift his eyes in
marys direction she opened her mouth
to speak but something choked back the
words and the man went dumbly down
the walk

 mary knew what had happened he
was wise mrs bennett had conferred
with mr bennett who had taken obe-
dient precautions against losing a ca-
pable servant during the rest of the ice
season a matter of a few days mary got
out of sight as soon as she heard big
johns wagon rumble up to the back gate

  and then one night just as she was
about to climb the long disheartening

stairs to her room mr bennett called
  mary come to the telephone

  even before she had the receiver at
her ear she knew it would be the home
her baby was ill desperately ill she
hurried to catch a late car a halting
snailish thing and sat fidgeting during
the half-hours journey her suffering
patent to the dullest of her fellow pas-
sengers he had been so well her baby
all during the hot weather growing
stronger and plumper every week as
every week she had gone to visit the
home seeking against odds to foster in
him the mother-love that other children
gain by daily contact tears welled up
and sobbing with grief and fear she sat
and twisted the wedding-ring round and
round upon her ungloved finger

  it was three oclock when she left the
home and threaded the dim silent streets
back to the bennetts once a policeman
stopped her looked a question into her
distorted face and stood aside with an
apology to let her pass mrs bennett
let her in asking news of the child with
perfunctory sympathy

  at six oclock mary was about pre-
paring breakfast with numb accustomed
hands the day wore by the hours
leaden and hopeless by telephone she
had news of her baby but no reassur-
ance after supper she started again for
the home

  when she alighted from the car a man
stepped down off the curb and accosted
her in the dusk

  mary he said it was big john
oh mary he pitied aint there
nothin i can do for you i saw ol
bennett on the street this after an i
couldnt help askin him about you he
says your little kid is sick say cant i
do nothin at all

  i guess not she answered dully and
turned toward the home

  lemme go in with you he urged
and mary neither consented nor denied
he went up the steps and followed her
through the door inside a doctor pull-
ing on his gloves was about to leave

  are you mary alline he asked
your baby is better dont worry
mary hell pull through now he went
out into the deepening night
sublimation



  to mary a girl in a nondescript uni-
form said

  you can go into the ward

  but she looked doubtfully at big john
aw lemme go too he begged im
the fellah this ladys goin to marry see
together they went in a nurse held
a little sleeping child in her lap with
a low sob mary went down on her knees
by her

  oh john she whispered aint he
just lovely

  the nurse laid the baby in marys arms
and tiptoed out mary sat rocking soft-
ly crooning in the half light of the ward
big john made a long and curious in-
spection

  some kid he announced in a husky
scared whisper

  he drew up a chair and mary slipped
her free left arm around his stooped
shoulders

  john she said a little hesitant hes
mine if you want us both why-hes
got good blood john

  you betcher he has said big john
aint you his mother well make one
grand man outer him hell do fine-if
he dont ill whale the stuffin out of
im

  he tapped marys finger with his own
toughened digit

  thats a bum ring he said to-
morrer well git you a good one

sublimation

       ublimation-sublimations
the only thing the doctor sat
y forward and took the little
tear-blotched face in his hands
nature makes fools of us if we allow
it-look at me none of your sentimental
folderol-work work up at five and at
it till midnight thats the only thing
that pays-nothing in love either you
get what you want and wish you hadnt
or you dont get it and wish you had
her youth stared up at him but
doctor kane i love him so much of
course i want to get over it now that he
doesnt want me but its hard-you were
young once-you ought to understand
the doctors lips drew down in a
sneer young yes but never in love

i	saw at once it was no special set of
eyes or teeth that i wanted-it was mere-
ly a matter of opportunity in sex-noth-
ing else any two normal people can
have that feeling-do you think that i
was going to allow any such atavism to
come between me and success no i
was above it and now im going to get
you above it youve got to go to work
but i cant do anything

  study art

  no sense of proportion

  suffrage

 havent enough brains

 music

 cant hum a tune

 well what have you enough sense
 for

 only for loving i guess and maybe
 -having some babies

 youre impossible

 no im not im all right-its just
 youth thats wrong youths an awful
 catastrophe and nobody prepares us for
 it i wish i were professional and
 forty she began to sob again

 doctor kane arose with a colossal air
 and patted her shoulders well the
 quickest way to get out of a shipwrecked
 love affair is to crawl into another boat
 she began to look cheerful but
 how 

 oh just go out cave-womanly and
 land one

 thats the most sensible thing you
 ever said to me-ill do it

 come back often and let me know
 how you progress

 she went out the side way and the
 doctor lost himself with another neuro

ii

 oh doctor kane i met the darling-
 est fellow-reporter from the herald-

by lane burr

            a


sublimation

it was like this-the conductor tried to
collect my fare twice i got angry and
said i paid you once and a young
man next to me said always take a
transfer-its a sort of receipt he was
simply a dear-i remembered what you
said about being a cave woman and put
it into action we chatted as delightfully
as though we had eaten out of the same
sand pile

  the doctor got up excitedly youd
better not talk to strange people in the

street that way-

  oh i didnt what do you take me
for we went straight to a tea-room
and then we tangoed and then it was so
late we dropped into the queerest little
newspaper joint thats what he called
it and smoked cigarettes and had some
cocktail-all the ladies did

  you must never do such a thing
again this is terrible im going to
phone your mother ill not be respon-
sible for any such insane acts i did
not mean that you should meet men in
an irregular way

  the girls laugh rippled away among
the books on the shelf and came back to
tug at his sense of humor oh i see
now what you meant by a cave woman
she continued you meant a steam-
heated cave with oriental rugs and run-
ning water you meant i should sit in
our parlor cave at home and when an
attractive young man passed in the hall
after having been admitted by the maid
that i should immediately grab my stone
ax and knock him senseless oh doctor
youre a clever physician but youve
made one big mistake-youve told the
truth and you cant pull me back
youve shown me something new and big
-talking to everybody-knowing every-
body and living-its the finest thing in
the whole world and im grateful

  the doctor rubbed his flattened palm
up and down the back of his head
whats that fellows name

  hans heimerdinger

  the blow was dynamic-the doctor
flew into a million pieces that dog-
i know him-hes worse than the man
you just escaped-hes in love with a
different girl every week-you must
never see him again

  but he makes love so beautifully-
he must have gone to the very best fin-
ishing school-he hadnt known me an
hour when he leaned over and kissed my
elbow

  and you permitted such a thing

  oh certainly not for more than a
second-then i made him come round
and kiss the inside soft part that rickie
always kissed-its heaps pleasanter

  i shall positively have you locked in
a private sanatorium if you persist in
such atrocities he jerked the receiver
down and called her number deftly
she twisted it out of his hand and pushed
the phone to the back of the desk

  look here doctor kane youve
known me all my life and you know im
to be trusted in a humane moment you
showed me a glimmer of the freedom a
woman might have if the world were
right and just because i caught your
meaning so well youre sorry-but im
not sorry still if it worries you so
ill go a bit more cautiously

  the great man who had bluffed a
thousand neuros into health paced the
little room in a rage i shall phone to
your mother or dismiss your case-make
your choice

  im dismissed she said taking his
big helpful hand into hers youve
cured me you know they say if you
dangled a string in front of a nervous
wreck and the wreck believed sufficiently
in that string hed get well-youve dan-
gled that string and i believe in it and
im well-i dont love rickie any more
and im happy i think it would be in-
teresting to write the case up in your new
book only you might have to go to sing
sing

  doctor kane opened the door and she
passed on out into the world of big spaces
that he had accidentally shown her

ill

  green things were frost-bitten and
steam pipes were banging when she rang
his door-bell again

  why did you come here this morn-
ing

  well because you say in your very
weightiest tome that yon like to keep in
touch with your old patients
on broadway and off



  you were never my patient properly
speaking

  perhaps not properly-but dont be a
bear-ive so much to tell you such
oodles of lovely harmless things have
happened to me in these few weeks
please cant i tell you some of them 
no

 why 

  im not interested

  why arent you interested
  because it makes me angry

  why does it make you angry
  because i am personally interested
  why are you personally interested
  is this a catechism class the big

 psychologist began to push his chair
 backward out of the way

 she moved forward

 no-but why are you personally in-
 terested 

 because i have known you since you
 werent born

 is that the only reason

 no thats not the only reason they
 stood up facing each other

 what else is there

 from somewhere down in among his
 kisses and his arms she heard him say
 sublimation and she whispered back
 you taught me to be a cave woman-
 you dear old bluff

on broadway and off

  henry miller who has scored a tri-
umph in the rainbow tells the fol-
lowing anecdote

  is there anything in the world so
pathetic as the spectacle of a young man
showing his favorite trick with cards to
a bunch of girls the slaughter goes
something like this let us suppose that
the man speaks first

   i used to know a clever trick with
cards if you like ill try to show it to
you while were waiting miss mar-
garet will you please choose a card from
this pack

  i am to choose which card do i
take 

   any one you like

   but how can i tell when you show
me only the backs of the cards and the
backs are all exactly alike

   thats it you just choose one at
random

   oh thats the way but is that
fair well ill choose ive got the
jack of hearts

  oh oh you mustnt tell me the
card you pick thats what im sup-
posed to tell you you know put it
back into the deck and choose another
why cant i keep this one i can
remember it better

   yes but then there wouldnt be any
trick you see you are to take a card

that i dont see and then im to find
out the one you looked at

  oh you couldnt do that well i
pick this one

   very well now look afc it and put
it back into the pack

   what part of the pack shall i put
it in

   anywhere you wish

   but how can you tell what card it
is if you dont know where i put it
well there it goes

   now take the deck and shuffle it
now give it to me presto-there is
this the card you chose

   oh dear-i dont know i forgot
to look and see which one i took does
that make any difference i should think
the trick would be better if i didnt know
oh look heres llelen and now there
are enough to play bridge plelen you
should have been here sooner mr smith
has been showing us the most wonder-
ful tricks with cards 

  tully marshall the clever actor gives
a study in self-revelation truly delight-
ful 

   children said the teacher instruct-
ing the class in composition you should
not attempt any flights of fancy simply
be yourselves and write what is in you
do not imitate any other persons writ-


on broadway and off

mgs nor draw inspiration from outside
sources

  as a result of this advice one bright
lad turned in the following we should
not attempt any flights of fancy but
write what is in us in me there is
my stommick lungs hart liver two ap-
ples one piece of pie one stick of lemon
candy and my dinner 

  heres a good story related by robert
edeson the popular actor

  an aged country couple on the ur-
gent invitation of a grandson who lived
in the city were on for a visit the
grandsons wife was very anxious that
the first meal should be one which the
aged couple would enjoy after their long
ride in the train and accordingly the
table groaned under its burden of good
things to eat

  in the course of the repast she no-
ticed several times that the old man
seemed to be making little progress with
the meal

   what is the matter grandfather
she asked dont you like my dinner

   no no my dear mumbled the old
man it isnt that only ive a pickled
onion in my mouth and i haint got but
one tooth left so its hardern sam hill
to catch it its so lively just rest easy
a spell till i git a holt on it and ill be
all right

  this defendant was scarcely within
the law  asserts jane cowl the beau-
tiful actress appearing in the play of
the above title

  once out in nebraska a man went
to protest against his real estate assess-
ment and one of the things of which he

particularly complained was assessing a
goat at twenty-five dollars he claimed
that a goat was not real property in the
legal sense of the word and should not
be assessed one of the assessors a
pleasing-faced old man obligingly said
that he could go upstairs with him and
they would look over the rules and reg-
ulations and see what could be done

  they looked over the rules and finally
the old man asked

   does your goat run loose on this
road 

   well sometimes said the other
wondering what the penalty was for that
dreadful offense

   does he butt  again queried the
old man

  yes answered the owner he
butts

   well said the old man this rule
says tax all property running and abut-
ting on the highway i dont see that
i can do anything for you good day
sir 

  making up has a variety of mean-
ings according to christie macdonald
who has made a decided hit in sweet-
hearts

  there had been a lovers quarrel and
it was his first visit in two weeks

   i guess you know there was a differ-
ence between your sister and myself
he ventured trying to pump the little
sister

  yes indeed responded the latter
without hesitation

   well-er-do you think clara will
make up when she comes down

  little bessie leaned over nearer and
whispered

   she is upstairs making up now

how i cured my
  superfluous hair

a friendly scientist showed me how to cure ft forever

i will tell you free how to cure yours too

    for a long time i was sorely troubled by a hideous
                            growth of superfluous hair on my face and arms my
                            face was indeed a sight from the exasperating growth and
                            i grew almost to bate myself
                            for my unsightly appearance
                            there are many things adver-
                            tised for superfluous ilair
                            and i think  tried them all
                            but never with any result
                            except to waste my money
                            and burn my skin

                              but notwithstanding all
 my years of disappointment
 today there is not a sign of
 superfluous hair on my face
 arms  or anywhere else i
 got rid of it through follow-
 ing the advice of a friendly
 scientist a professor of
 chemistry at an english uni-
 versity  the treatment he
 advised is so thorough
 simple and easy to use that i
 want every other sufferer in
 america to know about it it worked such a change in
 my appearance and my happiness that i gladly waive my
 natural feelings of sensitiveness and will tell broad-cast
 to all who are afflicted how i destroyed every trace of
 hair never to return

    if you are a sufferer and would like to have full de-
 tails just send along your name stating whether mrs or

we invite

 every thin man and woman

  this is an invitation that no thin man
or woman can afford to ignore we
invite you to try a new treatment called
sargol that helps digest the food you
eat-that puts good solid flesh on
people that are thin and under weight

  how can sargol do this we will
tell you this new treatment is a scien-
tific assimilative agent it increases cell
growth the very substance of which
our bodies are made-puts red corpus-
cles in the blood which every thin per-
son so sadly needs strengthens the
nerves and puts the digestive tract in
such shape that every ounce of food gives
out its full amount of nourishment to the
blood instead of passing through the
system undigested and unassimilated

  women who never appeared stylish in
anything they wore because of their thin-
ness men under weight or lacking in
nerve force or energy have been made to
enjoy the pleasures of life-been fitted to
fight lifes battles as never for years
through the use of sargol

  if you want a beautiful and well-
rounded figure of which you can be justly
proud-a body full of throbbing life and
energy write the sargol company
-n herald bldg binghamton n y
today for a c box sargol absolutely
free and use with every meal

  but you say you want proof well
here you are here is the statement of

those who have tried-been convinced-
and will swear to the virtues of this
preparation

rev george w davis says

i have made a faithful trial of the sargol treatment and mast
say it has brought to me new life and vigor i have gained twenty
pounds and now weigh  pounds and what is better x have
gained the days of my boyhood it has been the turning point of
my life

mrs a  rodenheiser writes

    i have gained immensely since i took sargol for i only weighed
about  pounds when i began using it and now weigh 
pounds so really this makes twenty-four pounds i feel stronger
and am looking better than ever before and now i carry rosy
cheeks which is something i could never say before

clay johnson says 

please send me another ten-day treatment i am well pleated
with sargol it has been the light of my life i am getting
back to my proper weight again when  began to take sargol
i only weighed  pounds and now  weeks later i am weighing
 pounds and feeling fine

f gaqnon writes 

    here is my report since taking the bargol treatment i am a
man  years of age and was all run down to the very bottom
i had to quit work i was so weak how thanks to argol i
look like a new man i gained  lbs with  days treatment

eyeglasses nolnegessary

eyesight can be strengthened and most forms of dis-
eased eyes successfully treated without
cutting or drugging

   that the eyes can be strengthened so that eyeglasses can
be dispensed with in many eases has been proven beyond

licly claim that their eyesight has
been restored by thatwonderful
little instrument called actina

granulated lids iritis cataracts
etc without cutting or drugging
over one hundred thousand
actinas have been sold therefore
the actina treatment is not an ex-
periment but is reliable the fob
lowing letters are but samples of hundreds we receive-
mr david suttle glen ellyn  writes i sent for your
ctina and when it came  told my wife  would throw my glasses
ly and give the actina a fair show i did so following directions
soon felt my eyes were getting in normal condition again and
 can say my eyesight is as good as ever and my headaches
lically vanished

 mr emery f deitrick  idlewild street ee pittsburg pa
 writes my eyes were very weak and my vision was so bad that i
 cond recognize people only at short distances since using actina
 have discarded my glasses my headaches are gone and my vision
 believe is as good as ever it was

   mr j h frankenfield  e th street cheyenne wyo
writes i am not wearing my glasses at all as for my catarrh
it is almost gone and i have been troubled with it for more than
sixteen years
