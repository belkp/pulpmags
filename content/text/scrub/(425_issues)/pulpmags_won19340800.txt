he best in science fiction stories d yi i i wmotwcmm for hundreds of years men and women have talked with hushed voices about strange people-men who are not men-women who are not women no one has ever dared to talk out in the open about it is it any won-

 in blunt understandable words he describes the unbe-

 amaze the civilized world dr la forest potter the author is a late member of the new york county
 medical society massachusetts medical society boston gynecological society associate professor of
 rhinology laryngology and otology new york school of clinical medicine and the author of many
 well known works

     the truth revealed

 can you distinguish these men and women of the shadow world do you
 know that their number is constantly increasing the strange
 power these men and women wield over normal people is
 almost unbelievable dr potter says no man on
 farth has a chance against a woman
 once she has succumbed to another
 woman actual clinical cases reveal the abnor- 
 mal ties and the unnatural desires and erotic
 reactions of these twilight men and women

 there are records that actually prove that men
 have been made into abnormals a
 startling provocative indictment against the
 false modesty that has been responsible for the
 growth of these fantastic strange amatory
 curiosities among savage and civilized races

famous but it must be remembered that the french
code is not the same as ours every nation has its own
individual modes manners and morals which are bound

wonders of reality

 by hugo gernsback

the relation between mind and matter
is such a tremendous problem that it is
doubtful whether wc ever shall know
much that is basic alout it we live in a material
world in which practically everything that we
sec touch and feel is forever unknowable in its
inner reality we can only guess at best what
is going on and most of our guesses are usually
wrong

  that is the reason why every year we have
a new electronic or atomic theory and why the
theories about the outside universe are changed
with every season to fit this or that new dis-
covery we know very little about the general
laws of nature we accept them but have not
the slightest idea what it is all about wc talk
glibly about such forces as gravitation electrici-
ty radiation etc without the slightest notion
what we are talking about we are forever
noticing the effects of all the natural forces
but we know next to nothing of their causes and
their constitution we have had physical knowl-
edge of the electric current for two hundred
years yet we know little more about it today
than we knew in the days of benjamin franklin
and when it comes to material substances we
know still less and the chances are that it may
be thousands of years before we get a good
conception of what it is all about scientists
today surmise that the ultimate particles of all
substances are electricity they call these elec-
trons and various other names but they still
do not know what electricity itself really is and
they may never know

  and when it comes to the linking of mind and
matter in our own brains and brain cells the

sum total of what we know is almost zero we
know that the mind is the driving force which
the brain obeys and we compare the brain to
a huge telephone exchange where numbers arc
called and where the nervous system comprises
the telephone wires which go to the various
parts of the body but we do not know the
connection between the incorporeal activity
which wc call mind and the material thing
which we call brain various observations
tend to show that the brain works on some
electrical principle but this reasoning again
leaves entirely out of account the activity which
we call mind-which is as intangible as it ha
always been since human beings started to think
about their thoughts

  and when it comes to analysis of the mind
into intellect perception judgment and various
other qualities of the mind that distinguish the
genius from the idiot the problem you will find
becomes more complex as you go on

  as a matter of fact one may make the obser-
vation that the more commonplace a thing is
the more wonderful and the more complex it
becomes at the same time and the more difficult
it becomes to know anything about its real
nature

  we of the present century boast of our su-
perior civilization and of our superior knowl-
edge yet the laughable fact is that we know
absolutely nothing about everything when it
comes down to the fine points or-as one says
in the vernacular-when we get down to brass
tacks nothing at all worth while is known
and nothing will be known for many generations
to come

dimensional fate

 by a l burkholder

	morituri te salutamus-the old ro-
man gladiators salute we who are
about to die salute thee that seems a
most appropriate opening for this narra-
tive for when you read these lines ben
and i shall be dead-yes dead-legally
executed by the state eliminated as men-
aces to society ha what a joke we
who have saved the world but i am
wandering and my bitterness destroys my
logic i do not expect to be believed for
the fact that this tale is unbelievable has
been well brought home to me by the cir-
cumstances of the past few weeks yet i
will persist and leave it with the warden
who has promised to have it published-
after the law has taken its course per-
haps it may serve as a warning to some
future investigators

  i am leopold dochler now awaiting
the end in the death-house of this-ah-
institution the man in the next cell is
benjamin patterson we have been tried
found guilty and sentenced to death for
the murder of our friend and colleague
joseph burnett and are suspected of be-
ing implicated in the disappearance of our
other friend and colleague alfred madi-
son

  the beginning of this story goes back
to  when we were all four of us young
men serving our country as privates in
company e of the - us infantry we
all had a great deal in common all being
orphans all being from new york city
and all being young fellows who had lied
like gentlemen about our ages in order
to get into the big argument over there
it must have been fate who placed us in
the same squad under a particularly ob-
noxious corporal he and the rest of our
squad all went west in the argonne
forest poor fellows but we four came

   	here is a good exciting story of tho
   fourth dimension of a world co-exis-
   tent with ours yet cannot be detected by
   any of oar senses because of the vibra-
   tional barrier which separates us from it

     we have found that many of our read-
   ers thoroughly enjoy stories of this type
   for it is one of the most fantastic themes
   that still remain within the bounds of
   logic

     the authors explanation of this other
   dimension is not only possible bnt dis-
   tinctly plausible

     the story is very well written and
  cleverly developed with a masterful
  climax

through almost two years of war un-
scathed we marched into germany and
then were eventually returned to new
york and honorably discharged that
was the beginning of our life-long friend-
ship for after the war we stayed to-
gether and worked at odd jobs trying to
eke out a bare existence during those hard
times meanwhile the hand of fate was
completing the next link in the strange
chain of circumstances that brought us
to this

  one evening about a year after our
return burnett rushed into our miserable
flat shouting with glee after we had
calmed him down enough to get an un-
derstandable statement out of him we
learned that an uncle of his who had
never even seen him had died leaving an
estate of fifteen million dollars and that
he was the only heir then he stated that
we were all going to college together at
first we demurred telling him that it was
unfair to him but he insisted he also in-
sisted that henceforth we should share
everything together and reminded us that
he had been the least successful in job-
seeking and had been practically living off
of us for the past year or more

  besides he continued we can all




wonder stories for august 

take allied engineering subjects as we
are all inclined in that way and after
graduation we can enter business to-
gether and probably be successful when
one would fail

  so it was decided all of us were elated
and a little dazed by the sudden good for-
tune that had been literally thrown into
our laps thus fate had completed an-
other link in the fatal chain

  our educations had not been very com-
plete so we had to spend two years finish-
ing our high school courses and review-
ing what we had forgotten finally how-
ever in  we all entered western coast
university together my first two years
were almost completely wasted for 
soon discovered that  had no scientific
ability at all and was more adapted to
philosophical and literary pursuits in
my third year i transferred to law and
thereafter led my classes and finally
graduated with highest honors from the
law college in the same year  the
other three of my partnership also grad-
uated with masters degrees in engineer-
ing

  we entered business together and
formed an engineering company my
friends were hydraulic mechanical and
electrical engineers and i was their legal
adviser and partner having had no other
interests in college we had all worked
hard each determined to outdo the others
and we applied the same energy and con-
centration to our work we had no finan-
cial worries in college and then had plenty
of capital with which to start in business
thanks to burnetts generosity so de-
spite the great world-wide depression
that set in during the same year we did
well and soon became all moderately
wealthy from our business

  it was then that burnett who was our
electrical engineer began his fatal ex-
periments in electro-physics and atomic
structure that he was a genius there is
no denying and he made amazing prog-
ress from the start we lent him every
assistance possible he believed that the
fourth dimension was a -dimension of
space and not of time although closely

related in some manner to the element of
time the theory of tiine-contraction is
now familiar to every educated person
namely that as an object moves it con-
tracts or loses dimension in the direction
of travel until it has lost all of its length
in the direction of travel when it readies
the speed of light about  miles
per second  then it is a two dimensional
object burnett further elaborated upon
this theory by maintaining that if the
speed of a moving object exceeded the
speed of light the object would not only
have lost all of its length in the direction
of travel but would have acquired a nega-
tive length in the same direction in other
words it would have become a fourth di-
mensional object when it exceeded the
critical speed of light such an object he
believed would have only three dimen-
sions but one of them would be a dimen-
sion utterly alien to us and the object
would then be utterly imperceptible to our
senses

  in order to accomplish this translation
of our third dimension into the fourth he
planned to speed up the movements of the
electrons about their respective protons
and the movements of the various pro-
tons about each other then in order to
avert an explosion of the atoms con-
cerned due to their flying apart as a re-
sult of increased centrifugal force the
electrons would be drawn closer to their
respective protons and the various pro-
tons closer to each other all of this he
hoped to produce with electrical machin-
ery and when we pointed out to him
that aside from disproving some of the
earths leading scientists pet theories and
solving the secret of atomic power he
would have some slight mechanical diffi-
culties to overcome in actually building
his macliines he simply laughed and flung
himself into his work

  plans and models seemed to magically
take shape under his hands and although
patterson and madison were popularly
conceded to be geniuses in certain engi-
neering lines they were as lost as babes
in the woods when they tried to follow
his more intricate lines of reasoning
dimensional fate



while i a mere lawyer with only two
years of study in engineering had to
throw up ray hands and beat a hurried
retreat to my private office where i im-
mediately commenced work upon the
most difficult case available in an effort to
persuade myself that i was not after all
a mere moron in intellectual matters

	there is not much use of discussing the

  two years of experimentation ant work
that followed suffice it to say that my
three companions worked incessantly
upon what they termed the great work
and over-mlel all of my suggestions that
a little attention to business might not be
amiss while i labored frantically to keep
the company off of the rocks they worked
like slaves npon the terrible machine that
was to end us all what pranks fate can
play i hired engineer after engineer to
do the work that piled up neglected by
my partners only to have my friends put
them to work planning out some detail of
the great incomprehensible machine that
was being built in fact i taxed all of my
legal knowledge to the uttermost limit
fighting lawsuits against irate customers
who were constantly suing us because
their projects were being held up by our
failure to fill contracts within the time
specified

  every accounting period i would in-
dignantly present my three friends with
an unfavorable balance sheet and wrath-
fully point out to them the loss incurred
during the period burnett would smile
and hand me a check to cover the deficit
then i would retaliate by stating that if
tliey persisted in their crack-brained
schemes even his vast fortune would
soon lie gone thereupon one or all of
them would impatiently shrug as if to
ask me how much longer  would keep
them from their work at this point i
would grow speechless with indignation
and rush from the laboratory back to my
office only to be beset by some customer
demanding to know why in the name of
this that and the other thing his boat or
machine or something had not been com-
pleted as per schedule we went through

this little act so often that we finally got
so we would do it automatically ami as a
matter of course if fate has any sense
of humor it must have howled with
mirth

  but tiiis eventually came to an end as
indeed all things must for one day when
i had suffered a particularly discourag-
ing reverse in court and was sitting in my
office reflecting bitterly on how i could
have prevented it had my three friends
only cooperated with me more fully and
that the good name of our business was
now practically goue i received a call to
hurry to burnetts laboratory i went
muttering and wondering what now
and was astounded to find my friends
executing an extemporaneous indian war
dance in the anteroom of the huge lab-
oratory just as  was about to withdraw
and telephone to the nearest psychopathic
hospital i was seized by madison

  its a success lie shouted excitedly
in my ear come see it

  i was hauled into the laboratory proper
to be confronted by an amazingly com-
plex jumble of vacuum tubes pipes
wires meters and valves liberally be-
sprinkled with a generous number of
motors transformers generators pumps
and other devices unknown to me in fact
the whole interior of the great laboratory
looked like an engineers nightmare to
me the explanation that followed was
as incomprehensible to me as a lecture on
selenium cells would be to a hottentot

  however the gist of the explanation
seemed to be that any object placed within
an imposing hemisphere of vacuum tubes
had the movements of its atoms and of
their component electrons speeded up un-
til they far exceeded the speed of light
whereupon they became fourth dimen-
sional and of course the object they
formed likewise became fourth dimen-
sional to prevent them from bursting
due to the increase of centrifugal force
they were drawn closer together thus
causing the object to become smaller ami
denser a very huge and complicated
system of refrigeration effectually dis-

posed of the heat generated by this in-
crease of atomic and electronic action

  now we will show you burnett joy-
ously stated and as he spoke he placed
a porcelain crucible upon a small stand
and set it within the hemisphere of huge
tubes

  i was cautioned to stand well hack and
my three friends hastened about in a
nervous manner hastily closing huge
switches and adjusting intricate-looking
dials with a seemingly infinite amount of
caution and painstaking care a low hum
arose from the machine which soon in-
creased to a roar as thousands of kilo-
watts poured over the cables and the
great tubes lit up with an unearthly glare

  then-wonder of all wonders-the
crucible and the iron stand upon which it
was set appeared to grow smaller then
they appeared to recede into the distance
gaining speed as they receded for miles
and miles in a moment they were ap-
parently untold distances away traveling
at a stupendous speed and yet plainly
visible within the walls of our laboratory
then they disappeared but what wrung
a gasp from me was the fact that the
space where they had been within tliat
weird hemisphere of glowing tubes had
also disappeared leaving nothing-noth-
ing at all

  when i say nothing i mean abso-
lutely nothing not empty air space nor
even blackness try to see out of the back
of your head you do not see blackness
you see nothing in fact you do not see
at all well that describes how the space
where the crucible and stand had been
appeared within the ghastly pale of the
rays and lights focused by that awful
hemisphere

the monster from the other world

	t started wonderingly forward only to

  be jerked back by patterson

  stay back you dumb-bell he fairly
shouted in his nervousness if you come
within the influence of those rays you
will be translated into the fourth dimen-
sion or perhaps torn apart due to parts of

you becoming fourth dimensional while
the remainder of you stays here

  we had better reverse it madison
said it is eating up current at a terrific
rate

  so the settings of the dials were care-
fully altered and the crucible with its
stand reappeared tiny and infinitely dis-
tant falling toward us at a terrible speed
through interplanetary distances yet
within the four walls of our laboratory
when it again appeared to be completely
normal and at rest within our strange
hemisphere of glowing tubes the current
was cut off and a moment later we were
examining the articles which were appar-
ently none the worse for their strange ad-
venture

  now burnett said triumphantly
we will show you something really
worthwhile watching

  while i was pondering over what un-
der heaven that something could be he
secured a cage containing a rabbit it was
sent through the machine into the fourth
dimension and brought back safely and
alive after a fifteen-minute interval

  this said burnett proves conclu-
sively that the portion of the fourth di-
mension corresponding to where we are
contains air a suitable temperature for
life solid ground or some other surface
upon which to stand and a force of grav-
ity which holds things down to that sur-
face we plan to build a larger machine
and send a man through to explore

  the next day we decided to close up
our business and devote all of our time
energy and resources to the work of con-
structing a new machine we had to in-
stall a huge powerhouse of our own and
at a fabulous price as our needs had far
outgrown the capacity of the local plant
and then there were numerous other diffi-
culties and delays but after a year of
unremitting labor and expenditure we
completed it i had thought that the other
machine was a huge affair but this one
dwarfed it and contained several improve-
ments over the old one it contained a
huge hollow sphere of vacuum tubes and
inside of this spere was an iron platform
dimensional fate



upon which the dimension travelers could
stand and be transported into the fourth
dimension with the platform

  when the time came for the great test
we decided that two of us should go while
the other two remained to tend the ma-
chines i had by this time been taught
hew to operate the controls so i took my
place with my three friends and we
drew lots to see who should go burnett
and madison won the right while pat-
terson and i who lost were to remain
patterson seemed very downcast but i
must confess that i felt only relief i
have never pretended to be brave any-
way

  as fate had apparently so decreed our
plans went through without a hitch the
pair were translated into the fourth di-
mension and returned to our own after a
five-minute interval

  wonderfulf madison exclaimed as
soon as he and burnett returned there
is a whole world in the other dimension
and it is lit by a blood-red sun

  we shall return immediately with sci-
entific instruments to measure gravity
air pressure and other natural phenom-
ena and take photographs and shall re-
main for several hours burnett stated

  the most remarkable thing madison
continued was the total absence of life
in any manner shape or form in fact
the entire place seemed to be a barren
mass of rocky crags and everything was
bathed in a ruby red light shed by the
glaring red sun

  the pair ridiculed patterson and my-
self whenever we tried to warn them of
possible dangers and insisted that we and
not they should make the next trip al-
though not without considerable spirited
argument for both patterson and i were
now burning with desire to see this
strange alien world it was finally agreed
that they should go and that four hours
after being translated to thifourth di-
mension they should return to the plat-
form and then in five more minutes we
would start the great machine that would
bring them back to our own familiar
world

  after a meal and a rest we gathered
together the instruments and cameras
that they needed and the pair gaily took
their places upon the platform as i
helped patterson close the giant switches
and set the dials i felt an awful premoni-
tion of impending evil come over me but
i put it aside as unworthy and foolish
after they were gone we certainly spent
a nervous four hours waiting and discuss-
ing this strange new world and what they
might be doing in it the minutes dragged
painfully slowly but finally the time
came and we adjusted the dials and closed
the switches

  then imagine our horror and con-
sternation for when the platform reap-
peared it was unoccupied

	after a short discussion we decided to

  return the iron platform for five min-
utes and then bring it back again as our
friends may have miscalculated the time
slightly then if they failed to reappear
one of us would have to enter the fourth
dimension and search for them

  upon the next appearance of the plat-
form we were however transfixed with
amazement standing upon the platform
was a huge creature like a winged dragon
with a semi-human face and it was hold-
ing burnett in one of its huge claws while
in another it held an automatic pistol that
i recognized as the one carried by madi-
son

  the beast seemed to be as astounded
as we were for it dropped its captive and
crouched down upon the platform anti
glared at us with a stupified air it was
about thirty feet long and stood about
seven feet high its pair of giant bat-like
wings projected nearly twenty feet into
the air above its back and its huge body
was supported by numerous legs each
leg was about the size of a mans and
ended in four large bird-like talons the
legs being arranged along its body in
pairs in much the same manner as those
of a centipede the monsters face and
head seemed almost semi-human in shape
except that the eyes appeared to be larger
and were a brilliant purple with big black


wonder stories for august 

pupils and had a baleful and malignant
glare in them in fact the entire creature
seemed to give one an impression of utter
vicious wanton wickedness of a type
never before equaled in this world

  quick help do something came
despairingly from burnett

  i recovered from my stupor of fear
and astonishment and perceived that when
the monster dropped him he had crawled
off of the platform and out of the ma-
chine instantly my brain legally trained
and made alert by many verbal jousts in
court reacted and i sprang to a cabinet
where an automatic was kept even as i
seized the gun two shots rang out the
monster whether by design or by acci-
dent i do not know had raised madisons
gun and sent two heavy forty-five calibre
slugs through burnetts abdomen as i
turned i saw patterson leap to the con-
trols and commence setting the dials to
hurl the accursed monster back to its own
infernal dimension

  the creature now showed signs of de-
siring to leave the platform of the ma-
chine so i risked breaking one of our
delicate tubes and sent a shot into its
front thereupon it hurled its gun at me
and uttered such a marrow-freezing
shriek that even now my blood runs cold
at the memory of that awful unearthly
cry then came the welcome roar of our
mighty generators and motors picking up
speed and the tubes began to glow with
their weird light seemingly awe-stricken
the monster cowered down upon the plat-
form and a moment later it had gone
back to its own dimension

  we immediately went to burnetts aid
and i raised him up between choking
spasms of coughing and vomiting blood
he told us that the other dimension was
inhabited by hordes of these creatures
they had unexpectedly captured him and
madison and taken them to an under-
ground city where after carefully exam-
ining all of their equipment they had
vivisected madison and experimented
with him until he died and then dissected
every fragment of his body while they
were still engrossed in the mysteries of

madisons body burnett managed to
escape and return to the platform of the
machine we brought him back just as
one of his pursuers leapt upon the plat-
form and seized him  thus we brought the
monster through also he further in-
formed us that the creatures were as far
above man in intellect as man is above the
apes and that they were evil and cruel
far beyond our power to even comprehend
evil and cruelty thereupon he begged us
to destroy the machine lest the monsters
should find a means of coming through
now that they were aware of our exist-
ence adding that they could take our
world and exterminate us more easily than
we can exterminate ants

a tragic climax

	we needed no more urging for pat-
terson and i hurriedly smashed every
one of the great tubes melted in an elec-
tric crucible all of the smaller and more
delicate parts and burned every plan and
note concerning the experiment that we
could find then we returned to burnett
only to find that he was dead

  well anyway thats done and over
with remarked patterson as he sank into
a chair with a sigh

  yeah but our troubles are probably
just beginning what are we going to say
about him  i asked pointing to burnetts
body

  then i continued and you explain
madisons disappearance there isnt a
court on earth that will believe us if we
tell the truth

  then it is too bad that we destroyed
all of the plans but i can make some
more and a model that will conclusively
prove our story patterson stated con-
fidently

  yes and give the secret away i
reiterated and then having a bunch of
dumb-bells playing with the idea and
bringing a horde of those monsters
through to our earth no patty we must
respect burnetts last wish and never re-
veal the secret not even to save ourselves
from the electric chair
dimensional fate



  but what shall we do patterson
 airly wailed in his despair

 well i said i have a plan that may
work we have several electric furnaces
tsad crucibles that will melt almost any-
thing so i will destroy these two guns
nd all of the ammunition then i will
dismember his body completely cremate
 of its parts and then dissolve the ashes
in nitric acid so that no trace will remain
after which  will clean up and dispose
of the broken parts of the machine

  meanwhile you shall devise from our
remaining apparatus as complicated a
machine as possible to study the effect of
high frequency currents upon the molecu-
lar and atomic organization of solids
burnett had some plans for such a ma-
chine among his papers and he built sev-
eral when he first began to experiment

  by the time we get all of that done
it will be morning then we will go and
look for burnett and madison and when
we dont find them we will report to the
police that they have mysteriously disap-
peared and offer a reward for news of
their whereabouts that should clear our
skirts but if we are questioned we will
say that we worked all night and that
they were to relieve us in the morning
then we will also show the machine that
you will assemble between now and to-
morrow to bear out our tale

  i spoke rapidly and as i talked i
gathered up the two automatic pistols
and ammunition broke open the cart-
ridges and burned the powder from them
in a small crucible then i reduced the
cartridge cases bullets and guns to a
puddle of molten metal in one of our
electric ovens when i turned from this
task i found patterson still sitting in his
chair staring at me

  well you sap what are you waiting
for i demanded get busy weve got
to work fast

  but it is all so horrible and what you
propose is criminal i am not a criminal
so why should i behave like one i have
done nothing that should need an alibi
he stated

  oh indeed well then suppose we

just let you do all of the explaining to the
police and incidently you can also-
my angry remarks were cut short by the
wail of an approaching siren

  ye gods here they come i ex-
claimed and then turning to patterson i
continued if that is the police coming
here let me do the talking and remember
that i am a lawyer so you dont have to
say a word get that not a word also
forget the shot that  fired at the monster
the only shots fired were the two that
killed burnett and the gun went back with
the monster see if  get us out of this
mess i wont be a lawyer ill be a legal
genius

  by this time the siren had approached
very close and then stopped there came
a very loud and imperious knocking upon
the main door of the laboratory building
i hurried out into the anteroom and
opened the door to be confronted by two
powerful-looking detectives and several
uniformed patrolmen who pushed their
way into the anteroom and then stood
gazing suspiciously around

  wots goin on here one of them
demanded

  i carefully inspected the individual who
spoke he was a large stocky flat-footed
man with a red overfed appearing face
and an air of brutality and lack of in-
tellect his companion was a man of
similar but less pronounced characteris-
tics and appeared to be older i had also
noted previously that the first individual
had addressed the other as chief so i
coolly ignored my questioner and ad-
dressed the more elderly one

  what do you want here i asked

  the patrolman on this beat reported
that he heard shots and screams here
answered the detective addressed while
the other showed signs of imminent apo-
plexy at my coolly premeditated snub

  you must be mistaken i countered
my friends and i are carrying on a
scientific investigation probably what
your man heard was the sounds from
some of our machines certainly that is
nothing to warrant a police investigation

	it is no use raising false hopes said

  the specialist you have acromegaly

  augustus loted the noted multi-mil-
lionaire heard this sentence of slow death
without any visible sign of emotion he
had expected it his sending for the spe-
cialist had been only for the purpose of
removing the last trace of doubt and the
expression on the eminent physicians
face had broken the news before he had
uttered it

  and there is nothing that can be done
for me he asked dully as he rose from
his chair and walked to the window

  in the present stage of our knowledge
there is not much but research is being
carried on   every week there is
hope of an illuminating discovery 
your condition will take years to run its
course-

  but the millionaire seemed not to hear
wearily he leaned against the frame of
the window and apathetically he gazed
across the public park that his house over-
looked the most noticeable thing about
that twenty-third century park apart
from the exotic plants and trees produced
by centuries of selective cultivation was
the remarkable lack of proportion among
the people in it men and women were to
be observed with heads three or four
times as big as they should normally be
others had hands or feet half as large as
their chests while very many though
well-proportioned on the whole were
giants seven or eight feet in height in
the past nearly all men had secretly
longed to grow to become as big as
possible but now people grew too much
they grew in ways they did not want to
grow and they could not stop growing
a nicely shaped body of about five foot
eight or nine was now the most highly

   	mr pragnell who is a growing favor-
   ite gives us here a unique tale that
   turns out altogether different than you
   will expect it to from the beginning of
   the story

     we are shown great changes that come
   over the life-forms of the earth during
   a comparatively short time normal hu-
   man beings turn into horrible contorted
   monstrosities for no apparent reason-
   acromegaly many animals and vegeta-
   bles become extinct and disappear com-
   pletely from the face of the earth while
   new queer things suddenly appear from
   nowhere what is causing this tremen-
   dous inexplainable change the revela-
   tion leads us into strange adventures on
   an alien planet

desired thing on earth and a possession
few people could boast of

   the cause of the trouble lay in a little
body called the pituitary gland found at
the base of the brain and in the center of
the skull it has two lobes the posterior
and the anterior and the anterior lobe
controls the growth of the body when it
was insufficiently active science could
remedy the deficiency but when it was
overactive making giants of children and
causing adults to develop in unusual ways
there was no known way of correcting the
trouble the former condition was known
as gigantism and the latter as acro-
megaly and both resulted in the loss of
physical and mental activity and of sexual
power through long ages of effort man-
kind had nearly succeeded in its war
against the disease-producing bacteria
and their allies the vastly smaller viruses
only to find this rare and curious condi-
tion developing into a menace that threat-
ened to destroy it

   it is the penalty we pay for prolifera-
tion said the physician joining him afi

duction of food sent the population soar-

ing so that it increased twenty times in
a hundred years something was lost we
produce the known vitamins by intensive
methods but there must be some at pres-
ent unknown vitamin which is essential
to the pituitary gland our present knowl-
edge is insufficient to support a popula-
tion so huge that in spite of the efforts
of governments our numbers have stead-
ily dwindled until they are less than
half of the peak figure this decline due
less to actual deaths than to the loss of
sexual powers in victims will go on until
either the remaining people are forced
back to more natural lives or we learn to
correct this condition

  it was the legacy of crowther the
millionaire cancer victim to the cause of
cancer research that led to the control
over that one-time scourge yourself if
you could be induced to take an interest
might give an enormous impulse to the
investigations of the trouble you are
suffering from he stopped suddenly
doubting if he were being listened to

  you dont believe drawled the suf-
ferer like some writers that mankind
will be destroyed by it 

  no briskly the balance of nature
will reassert itself

  perhaps without a place in the scheme
for mankind what if the main sources
of your unknown vitamin are extinct
many species of plants and animals have
gone out of existence in the last hundred
years or so and many more have come
into being

	after the catastrophic crash of the

  parker group of companies which
suddenly pauperized many thousands of
well-to-do families augustus loted stood
out clear and unchallenged as the great-
est financier of the day indeed none
knew the full extent of his powers for
his operations extended secret ramifica-
tions into every phase of economic life
people still fondly believed that they were
governed democratically but the truth
was that loted dictated to every govern-
ment in the world for he had many
ways of breaking obdurate politicians

whether they belonged to that bulwark of
wealth and privilege the communist
party or were the wildest revolutionaries
many millions owed tbeir living directly
to loted

  the fact that the curse of the age
had had the temerity to attack this power-
ful man was naturally seized upon by
news agencies and proclaimed through-
out the world the multi-millionaire gave
two million dollars to the cause of re-
search and further offered a reward of
half a million for any person discovering
a cure a flood of letters and personal
calls followed from persons who needed
only a little financial backing to enable
them to accomplish this there was a man
who believed that he could do it by means
of drugs to be obtained from the hardy
vegetation that grows in the deepest
crevasses of the moon another who had
discovered a spring of curative water in
the center of the sahara desert exact
location unknown another who wanted a
hundred thousand dollars with which to
build a machine to produce rays to do
the trick and one man wanted to breed
a certain kind of tropical insect whose
bite he thought efficacious by no means
the least wild were schemes for obtaining
the necessary information from the planet
venus

  a few words concerning the stage that
had been reached in terrestrial corre-
spondence with venus would not be out
of place here in  were received the
first messages known to have originated
on venus but many years passed before
intelligent communication was achieved
and the formula for that frightful explo-
sive venusite transmitted venusite is
one of the more complicated carbon com-

ever another followed and another and
another and yet another before a halt
was called to this waste of human life

  about a hundred years after the de-
parture of the first vessel men began to
become alarmed about the growing twin
menaces of gigantism and acromegaly
and somebody conceived the idea of ask-
ing venus what it knew about them this
rather absurd step met at first with en-
couraging success for the venusians de-
clared that they knew all about vitamins
which it seemed were fundamental fac-
tors in life and constant throughout the
universe they knew what vitamin it was
that we lacked had it in abundance but
could not tell us how to produce it
spurred on by the hope of bringing life-
giving knowledge back to earth many
more brave men were swallowed up by
the void

  loted had all suggestions transferred
to paper and employed a staff of scien-
tists to report on their feasibility one or
two of them contained discoveries that
the writers had spent a lifetime of toil
in achieving and he stole these to aug-
ment his own fortune success is not
built upon scruples he told a scientist
who had objected well knowing that he
could hound the man to suicide if he
spoke about it perhaps the most persist-
ent of these would-be bene factors of
humanity was martin harley but as he
refused to give details of his proposals
demanding a private interview to explain
them he was ignored

a strange proposal

	it was about  one morning when
loted was awakened by the warning
bell under his pillow somebody was
stealthily climbing through the window
instantly the automatic precautions be-
gan to operate for though he secretly
controlled a considerable force of gun-
men there were many men he had ruined
who might take a desperate chance for
revenge out of sight of the bed the
recess with its window was lit with in-
visible infra-red rays throwing on the

screen before him a clear picture of a
young man very roughly dressed and thin
to a point that spoke of semi-starvation
with one leg over the sill with a smile of
grim satisfaction the financier fingered
the switch that would send the intruder
into eternity but catching sight of the
mans eyes in which glowed the fire of
genius or insanity he held his hand this
was not any ordinary thief or murderer
perhaps something useful might be
learned from him before he was killed

  the instant the man was inside steel
bars snapped across the window trapping
him startled he looked wildly round
flashing his torch

  i see you though you dont see me
came loteds voice in the darkness drop
that torch and walk two paces forward
then twelve to the right disobey me and
you will not live a second

  the intruder obeyed

  you must be a brave man observed
loted musingly still watching in his
screen you seem to have iron muscles
and a light frame but still your climb to
the window must have been a ten to one
gamble with death quite apart from the
 volt current that is supposed to
await such enterprising persons as your-
self

  i had to see you said the man gain-
ing confidence and as you refused to in-
terview me i chose this way in taking
your live wires for bluff i was right but
i see your other precautions are not bluff
i am martin harley

  your identity i had guessed as for
my precautions being bluff if i chose to
press the button of the venusite pistol
that i am pointing at you you would
know they are not or rather you would
know nothing more tell me what you
want to but i warn you to be brief and
interesting or i shall end the interview
in a particularly abrupt fashion

  nervously the intruder licked his lips
and rubbed his hands together to a poor
man like myself invisible croesus life is
not so pleasant that i should greatly re-
gret losing it half starved always and

nearly frozen in winter i am kept in just
that bare existence accorded to those un-
able to support themselves in the crazy
economic system ruled by such men as
yourself yet i once had wealth

  imperceptible in the dark the finan-
ciers eyes hardened another word and
he would know that this was merely an-
other victim of his seeking revenge
there were graves for such

  my fortune the man went on was
dissipated not as a result of your actions
but in an endeavor to help humanity in
perfecting the project i am about to put
before you  now know that only with
the assistance of wealth can i hope to put
it into operation i need ten thousand dol-
lars to finance a trip to venus in a ship
of my own design

  harsh and abrupt in the dark sounded
the financiers laugh this was so simple
so crude

  its easy enough i should think to
get yourself included in the next load of
suicides you will need something more
subtle than that to get money out of me
i am hardly in a position at the mo-
ment to put my case in the best light but
being well aware of the monotonous tale
of total disappearance that has ended
every previous attempt to reach venus i
have come to the conclusion that in every
case the same mistake was made namely
that the project was known to venus
you certainly are original there ad-
mitted loted you suggest the venusians
themselves destroyed these vessels but
why should they he hostile towards us
why should they not they say that
they have the cure for your trouble for
the worlds trouble but cannot transmit
the knowledge frankly i do not believe
it and i have built my ship to test my
idea it is very powerful and will carry
two persons only and is designed to set
out and land upon venus secretly what
will happen when we get there i do not
know for the journey one way will ab-
sorb nearly all the venusite leaving us
unable to get back without a fresh
supply

	loted clicked his teeth and smiled
  broadly this talk amused him more

than anything had done for a long time

  on the strength of that you expect
ten thousand dollars you know young
fellow there is one golden rule for suc-
cess in life my father told it to me and i
will tell it to you free gratis and for
nothing it is this never trust anybody
and treat every proposition put before
you as fraudulent and every person you
meet as a swindler every time i have
departed from that simple rule i have
been stung

  i can prove my honesty cried the
man i will show you the ship  have
built or if you fear a trap an agent of
yours

  while we have been talking said
loted  have been thinking and i have
made a decision

  to throw me out or shoot me with
a wry smile

  no to help you fit up your vessel
and to travel in it to venus as your pas-
senger

chapter ii
the evening star

	airplanes transported the costly venu-
  site the air-producing apparatus and

the stores to the hiding place in the rocky
mountains then one dark night the little
bullet-shaped vessel shot out across the
californian plains then the side vanes
turned her nose upwards and she slid
gracefully out of the atmosphere off into
space she was a masterpiece of strength
without weight an eggshell full of sep-
arate compartments each constructed to
seal itself hermetically if air escaped

  the oddly assorted pair inside enjoyed
each others company more than they had
expected after some days when they
were well under way and nothing re-
mained for a while but to keep steadily
accelerating they developed a habit of
playing games together and of conversing
in a cabin where the indicators were at
which harley could glance from time to
time to assure himself that all was well
harley was the first to endanger this
a visit to venus



peaceful progress by embarking on con-
troversial topics

  it seems strange to me mr loted
harley said that you should give up
all your comforts and luxuries for the
discomforts and dangers of this voyage

  loted altered his position in the com-
fortable arm chair that he had had in-
stalled for his own use and knocked the
ashes from one of his special cigars with
the fingers of a hand already rather
large he stroked a jaw that was getting
longer then he answered

  perhaps it is not so surprising as you
think you see i was about at the end
of my tether and would soon have had to
give up those luxuries for some time
things have not been going quite so well
with me as i have pretended and some
of my little forgeries and other tricks
must be found out soon the crash was
not far off actually i am insolvent to the
extent of about fifty million dollars to
say nothing about a lot of people who
think theyre rich and who will have a
shock when they find theyre not oh
its not a very unusual thing he went on
as harley made no remark merely high
finance you and foolish scientists like
yourself grow poor helping humanity
while i wax rich and powerful by being
utterly mischievous its the way the
world is run a queer way perhaps but
there you are

  he paused for a reply but harley
remained silent and motionless his pierc-
ing eyes fixed on the pseudo-millionaire
it struck the financier suddenly how like
that thin hard sharp-featured face was
to a cuttingtool of tempered steel

  so you see continued the great man
in a voice from which the affability of
the last few days had gone it was expe-
dient for me to get away for a while
now i have another home a nice quiet
little place in a pleasant spot in the holi-
day islands in england in fact near the
ruins of the ancient port of southampton
there i shall be simply john william
barto a man of ample but not excessive
means my family is already there the

money is there money that i need hardly
say should really go to my creditors
but barto himself is not there nor has he
been seen how to get him there puzzled
me but when you proposed your secret
space-trip it sort of cleared matters up a
little way out into space staying away
long enough to alter my appearance com-
pletely with the aid of a portable plastic
surgery outfit an unobtrusive landing in
a wild part of an english forest among
the bears and lions and- well there you
are the few years of comparative health
i have left spent in sport and hunting

  oh im not afraid of your betraying
me for i shall still be able to pull a few
strings breathe a word of my hiding-
place and the police of any country will
throw you in jail on some invented charge
if one of my gunmen doesnt get you in
the back first and if you keep quiet i
will pay you a reasonable amount for
your services

  i know nothing admitted harley
quietly about high finance such matters
do not interest me but i venture to re-
mind you that when you entered this ves-
sel you started on a mission and that
mission will be carried out you may
settle in england some day but at pres-
ent you are coming with me to venus

	loted rose from his chair his big
frame seeming about to fall upon and
crush the slight figure before him in
spite of the towering bulk of the one
and the dried-up quality of the other
they looked at that moment strangely
alike two men of fixed resolve and in-
flexible wills loted had hacked his way
through life by sheer dominant person-
ality was accustomed to command to
bending governments to his will harley
had pursued one idea for nineteen years
and had never budged from his purpose

   fool said loted do you think that
i had not foreseen your resistance and
that i am not prepared for it did you
think i would accompany you in your
mad suicide at this moment fool you
are unarmed see this venusite gun 
with it i could blow you out of exist-


i

wonder stories for august 

ence then pilot the ship back at my con-
venience yes i have had instructions in
landing space-ships if you wish to live
stand up and walk into that room where
you will be locked up until i choose to let
you out stand up

  but harley sat still quite undisturbed

  your description of me may be cor-
rect he said coolly but the evidence
you base it on is not for i have never
quite trusted you and was prepared for
some such move as this why brandish
before me a weapon with which you could
kill a sperm whale when you have enough
physical strength to do what you like
with me kill me if you wish my death
would be quicker than yours for you
would wander about in space until you
died of starvation or thirst i have so
mixed up the indicators and controls that
only  can understand them you know
that the solar system is flat all the planets
on one plane well i have deliberately
wandered off that plane and unless i
remain in charge we shall spend years in
the void waste much lime and our sup-
plies will not last to venus

  loted had often been called a man of
iron but iron is cut by steel harley got
his way

  the landscape of a strange planet
who can forget the thrill the emotions
that assail one when he steps out of a
space-vessel and after weeks of monot-
onous confinement stands upon and
gazes around at a world other than that
in which one and ones forefathers were
born the habit of regarding this earth
as the center of the universe though we
know it to be the contrary is still strong
enough to give us a distinct shock when
first we see with our own eyes another
world just as apparently limitless and
clothed with just as varied life all with-
out counterpart at home in the sky is a
sun of the wrong size and either red or
blue according to the density and extent
of the air perhaps as on jupiter the air
is full of flying things without wings
perhaps as on mars the very shrubs
make noises weird and shrilling perhaps
as on ganymede protective mimicry has

been developed to such an extent that one
never knows when any plant or stone
may suddenly spring away upon ones
approach

  and to loted and harley as they
stood knee-deep in the yellow moss that
carpeted the low lull on the side of which
they had landed and looked at the unfa-
miliar landscape there were many other
factors to fill their breasts with unusual
emotion the bright eyes of the fanatical
harley glittered with subdued triumph
while loted looked like a punctured bal-
loon under the unaccustomed experience
of being beaten besides that they be-
lieved themselves the first men ever to
make a successful landing upon a strange
world except for our barren neighbor
the moon and the prospect of returning
was so remote as to be hardly worth con-
sideration

  almost entirely without incident the
journey had seemed to bear out harleys
contention that secrecy was the first es-
sential for a successful journey to venus
they were on a probably hostile planet
with a perfectly hopeless mission

  wish id shot you the moment i set
eyes upon you growled loted this
project is the maddest the most ridicu-
lous ever conceived of in the mind of
man its my opinion sir that you are a
lunatic a monomaniac

the creatures of venus

	as he had expected harley took no

  more notice of him than one does of
the yapping of a stray dog perfectly
impossible to annoy him with insults he
was a man of one idea and it is doubt-
ful if he had heard all the others rav-
ings he stood now contemplatively gaz-
ing at the only animals of any size in
sight three beasts with round green
bodies and four legs one straight and
tapering while the others were curved
almost in a semi-circle after a while one
realized that the short leg was a sort of
beak or tube by means of which the group
was poking about in the moss probably
feeding

abruptly loted turned and walked
a visit to venus



away but harley had not completely
forgotten him

  where are you going  he asked

  im fed up with you burst out the
other with your silly ways and insane
ideas im going to broadcast a message
to the ruling beings on this planet saying
who we are and throw ourselves at their
mercy its the only way

  you can try if you like ive already
taken steps to make the apparatus inop-
erative

  did the man think of everything
every move he had planned was fore-
stalled prevented how he longed to
take the miserable scraggy body and rend
it to fragments how he had underesti-
mated him a dangerous cunning antag-
onist  but he had a queer feeling that in
the energy and resource of the other lay
his only hope of ever getting away from
this horrible place he was beginning to
realize how helpless the most capable man
is when out of his accustomed surround-
ings

  i think observed harley moving
at last that it would be as well to do a
little judicious exploring we need more
food and those green things may be
good to eat we had better take dark
glasses to shield our eyes from this glar-
ing light hand guns with solid bullets
for game yes and others with explosive
missiles in case of danger although i
understand that there are no harmful
beasts or plants here i like to be pre-
pared also seeing that the air here is so
poor in oxygen and charged with car-
bonic acid gas it would be wise to carry
small tanks of oxygen on our backs for
emergencies care to come

  loted growled his assent

  cautiously avoiding the top of the hill
which would show them up in silhouette
against the clouds they walked around the
side until they were in view of the exten-
sive panorama beyond it was one of the
most barren ill-favored spots of venus
for vegetation was scarce most of the
ground being bare and rocky wherever
it could obtain a hold the feathery yellow

moss grew and sinister looking red blobs
scattered about proved to be clumps of
trees away to the right a blue sea broke
in a line of foam on a sandy beach a long
arm of water running from it coiled
round like a figure six round this inlet
was an expanse of marsh covered with
rank vegetation showing the gold red
and brown colors of woods in autumn
birds with leathery wings and huge beaks
crammed with teeth flew above shrieking
harsh cries at first glance the whole
valley seemed void of the usual evidences
of intelligent creatures buildings roads
machinery and visible cultivation

  loted saw them first mushrooms
he grunted

  indeed they looked very much like
mushrooms hemispherical white objects
on stalks a hundred feet high standing
out vividly against the various vegetations
of the swamp

	walking on down the slope the two

  passed through one of the red jungles
and noted that the trees gave forth a
sweet sickly scent beyond it they came
upon a number of the green beasts brows-
ing among the tall moss while loted
was still wondering how to kill animals
without heads harley fired at one of the
nearest the sharp report sounded like
a brutal assault on the silence of the semi-
wilderness

  the stricken creature gave several
agonized leaps high into the air then
fell and lay still forthwith the others
bolted in long jumps bending their joint-
less legs as a snake bends its body ex-
cept for the two companions of the fallen
one who stayed and felt the body with
their yellow beaks seeing the two men
they leaped together

  realizing that he was being charged
loted fired at the hurtling green body
then side-stepped hastily it turned in
mid-air and almost fell on him knocking
the breath out of him he wriggled from
under the corpse and got up to see that
harley had accounted for the third

  with harley carrying one of the
bodies they began to retrace their steps


wonder stories for august 

btit now the heat the moistnre-laden
air and the lack of oxygen were begin-
ning to tell upon them and panting and
grunting they were glad to sit down and
rest in the shade of the red jungle whose
smooth branching stems rose without
leaf bud or flower thirty feet above
them they did not know that few crea-
tures that stop to rest in the carnivorous
venusian jungles live to tell the tale

  harley yawned heavily the sweet
musky smell made him very sleepy

  quite safe he muttered rest here
have it on thority venusians them-
selves nothing harmful on venus all
sterminated long ago

  loted wanted to remind him that what
was innocuous to the natives of venus
might be harmful to strangers from earth
but the thought was too complicated to
put into words he sank into happy slum-
ber a soft contentment that he had sel-
dom known in his hard life came over
harley his immediate surroundings
faded away into a world of dreams

	 

  for how long he slept he never knew
but presently he became aware of some-
one shouting something had gripped him
tightly by one leg but he took no notice

  the shouting persisted a hoarse shout-
ing and the meaning of the words slowly
forced itself upon his unwilling brain

  wake up harley save me

  why couldnt the fellow leave him in
peace 

  sit up harley sit up and take a
breath of oxygen or we are both dead
men

  what was he talking about  what oxy-
gen did he mean

  throwing out one arm in a subcon-
scious gesture he touched the pipe that
led from the tank on his back and turned
the tap a stream of pure oxygen hissed
out near his nose scorching his lungs
like fire

  he found himself tightly held round
the legs and chest by snaky branches of
the trees and being lifted up by them

carnivorous plants yet he had been told
that such things were not to lie found on
venus already his legs were cold and
numb from lack of circulation

chapter iii

the venusians

 wriggling desperately harley man-
aged to slide his hipbone free and to
get out his explosive pistol in reaching
for it he touched another limb with his
head and it instantly whipped round his
face nearly stopping his breath blindly
for he was unable to take deliberate aim
he fired his pistol instantly there was a
deafening crash and a fearful shock that
was almost fatal for the powerfully ex-
plosive bullet had struck a limb scarcely
eight feet away from him splinters and
drops of warm sticky moisture struck his
face

  he was falling headlong loted with
him he saw loted strike the main stem
and sprawl apparently dead on his face
then he struck the soft ground himself
though it rendered him dizzy he was
not unconscious but he might almost as
well have been for his weapon was now
yards away the persistent plant had not
released him and presently he was swing-
ing aloft again a large pad fastening on
his breast he felt the beginning of the
suction that would presently draw all of
the blood from his body

  at first he thought that his eyes were
deceiving him for as he hung upside
down he saw six of the most ridiculously
complicated creatures hopping about with
an absurd air of dignity through the
gloom below creatures with two bodies
one growing on a sort of stalk out of the
other as he looked he saw that each
individual was not one but two that a
novel form of animal rode standing up
on the three-legged beast as though the
latter were horses these newcomers to
whom the green things were obviously
inferior had egg-shaped bodies red and
purple with no heads one flexible leg
ending in a round pad yellow beak-like
tubes four in number sticking out of
a visit to venus



their middles and two big triangular

eyes at opposite points to each other so
that while one eye stared ahead the other
glared out at the back each had two
arms like branching whip-lashes

  were these the intelligent beings of
venus who communicated regularly with
earth it seemed incredible yet it was
obvious that they had some intelligence
hardly expecting any response harley
shouted for help

  they stopped and looked up for a
while they conferred together then
reaching a decision pointed upwards with
some sort of weapon dense clouds of
acrid smoke smelling like burning flesh
arose there was a crackling and sizzling
and a screaming as of tortured animals
and harley fell again to the ground this
time losing consciousness

	 

  when he recovered it was to find him-
self lying face down on one of the green
beasts held in place by its strong tail
and being carried in a series of leaps over
the plain his body was a mass of cuts
burns and bruises particularly his back
which felt as though he had been dragged
feet foremost through the prickly under-
growth

  warm drops of water falling gently
on his back awoke him to the fact that
steady persistent rain had soaked him
thoroughly twisting his neck out of its
cramped position he caught sight of
loted captive like himself on a green
steed

  woke up have you exclaimed the
financier who had escaped with little in-
jury considering nice mess youve got
us into now eh wouldnt it have been
better to have reported our arrival prop-
erly than to be caught like this what
chance do we stand now

  harley bit his lip indifferent as he had
appeared the great mans defection had
hurt him deeply and some of his gibes
did find chinks in his armor craning his
neck to see ahead he saw that they were
approaching the town that looked from a
distance like a group of mushrooms up
and down the tall stems hopped dozens

of the unipeds using steps that stuck
out like large tea-spoons they were very
agile and could turn in mid-air

	arriving at the town the procession
went on through the stems to where a
particularly large building reared its head
on three pillars high above the rest of the
town here they were lifted down and
it was made plain that they were required
to ascend expecting the frail branch to
break harley tried it but though it
bent under his weight it held and he went
on to the next loted followed had he
not been prompted by fear he could not
have gone up to that dizzy height ex-
pecting every moment to slip miss his
leap or break a step and be precipitated
to the ground but at last sweating pro-
fusely and gasping he reached the com-
parative safety of the unrailed platform
at the top and followed harley inside

  pleased to meet you said a low voice
both men jumped and looked around for
the speaker but no one was there except
a particularly tall uniped over seven foot
high standing on the soft floor that was
covered with what appeared to be a nat-
ural growth and regarding them solemn-
ly with his big triangular eye

  i see went on the voice that you
are incapable of telepathy just as your
planet would be incapable of interplane-
tary communication but for the power of
our instruments in transmitting and their
sensitivity in receiving among us indi-
viduals who have no more telepathic
powers than you are objects of pity i
welcome you to venus there are many
things we can learn from each other but
for the present i see that you are tired
and extensively injured when you are
rested and refreshed we can talk
completely bewildered the two men
found themselves shut in a small room
that was empty save for two bowls of a
grey-greenish paste on the floor they
tried it it was intensely salty and had a
peculiar flavor but was not altogether
disagreeable realizing that they would
have to eat it or starve they drained the
bowls

  didnt seem a bad sort observed
harley fine thing being able to under-
stand him right away keep on the right
side of him and i can see our mission
being completely successful

  yes agreed loted stretched on his
back but you know old fellow you
must leave all the talking to me for i am
more accustomed to conducting negotia-
tions than you are

  before long his opportunity came for
a small uniped suddenly flung open the
door and beckoned them out waiting
for them were the tall uniped and sev-
eral others

  we thank you for the hospitality
began loted you have extended to us
and for saving us from the red trees we
have-

  cease your infernal babbling the
forceful telepathic message crashed into
their brains with the violence of a loud
shout treacherous murderous beings
while i have been entertaining you here
you have been planning the death of my
subjects what is this terrible trap of
which you told me nothing and by which
you have done to death my sons and
daughters speak tell me or i shall
have you cut to pieces where you stand
the complete change of face so sudden
and unexpected took the space-travelers
off their balance they could do nothing
but stare open-mouthed for a moment
the angry venusian seemed to search
their minds

  do not attempt to deceive me by pre-
tending surprise he shrieked tell me
what you have done to them hardly had
your vessel been found and brought here
and my own children eleven of them had
gone to examine it before cries of agony
were heard i received their telepathic
calls for help they have fallen every
one with a feeling as of flames consum-
ing their insides how have you done this
thing

in the grip of the tripeds

	harley suggested he should go and see
  what was wrong

and make your escape  i have it six

of my guards will take you there and
this big stupid man i will keep remem-
ber my word is law and if my children
do not return alive and well or if one
dangerous weapon is found on the vessel
-well you will both be very very long
in dying take him

  as harley stepped out onto the plat-
form he looked down upon a milling mob
of venusians as soon as they saw him
their fury beat upon him with an almost
physical force like a strong wind the
thoughts of one stronger than the others
came to him theres one of the devils
tear him into pieces

  a staff cut from one of the red trees
slashing across harleys bruised calves
stung him to action and he followed the
guards down and around the post

  back they ordered upon which the
crowd fled precipitately one a small one
seemed to have something wrong with his
leg for in his haste he stumbled leaped
to his foot and stumbled again impatient-
ly a guard struck it with a staff the effect
of which was to make harley suddenly
feel ill for the weapon sank a foot into
the body and grey fluid poured out the
obviously dying venusian began a low
wailing moan

  some way off from the town and near
the yellow sands of the sea harley saw
the eggshell which he had designed and
built and which had brought him here
from millions of miles away that it had
fared roughly in the hands of the venu-
sians was evidenced by a jagged hole in
the side through which the party entered
once inside harley breathed deeply the
delightful fresh air to realize abruptly
that it was too fresh around him the
guards were making strange noises

  oxygens leaking he muttered

  through several rooms disordered by
exploring venusians they went the
guards despite their obvious distress
kept up with the man they came upon
several contorted corpses then to a room
heaped with bodies an oxygen supply
pipe ran here the tap was turned on
and the tanks were empty the positions
and attitudes of the torn and tortured
a visit to venus



unipeds told their tale ignorant of the
functions of taps they had turned it and
passed on until with their breathing-
tubes scorched by the life-giving element
with which nature has been so niggardly
on venus they made a hasty retreat past
the open tap as they reached it in their
flight they had one by one collapsed

  nothing could be done a venusian
gasping painfull grasped harleys arm
and pulled a prophetic vision of his fate
in the hands of the angry king came to
him the extra supply of oxygen had
cleared his brain his nerves and muscles
were unusually quick and decisive giving
him ample energy and boundless confi-
dence in himself he would not be led
nnprotesting back to certain death he
struck with his free arm at the triangular
eye of the creature that held him to his
profound surprise it was softer than
jelly and his arm plunged deeply into the
unipeds substance

  appalled at this to them supernatural
strength the others were too startled to
move and harley realizing that he must
now tight to the death picked up a chair
and despatched two more but the other
three were out of reach and raised weap-
ons similar to those he had seen in action
against the carnivorous trees

  a long period or so harley thought
elapsed while he stood waiting for death
to strike from those deadly tubes a tre-
mendous roar filled the room and he was
precipitated to the floor his fall broken
by soft bodies so this was death he
thought noting with calm detached in-
terest that he felt no pain a moment
later he realized his mistake incredibly
he was not dead but amazing fact the
venusians all were staggering to his
feet and struggling across the swaying
floor he looked ut of a splintered win-
dow to see that an explosion had wrecked
the space-ship and hurled the fragment
he was in high into the air possibly the
escaping gas had found its way to the
remaining venusite and detonated it or
possibly some exploring uniped escaping
the fate of his companions had reached
the control-room and meddled inex-

pertly with the machinery whatever it
was that caused the explosion he never
found out

	now he was falling precipitately and

  stretched himself on the corpses to
break as far as possible the force of the
drop when the shock came it was less
violent than he had expected but left
him plastered with unpleasant jelly
through the hole where the window had
been water poured he had fallen into
the sea

  unable to reach the window because
of the force of the water he pushed at
the door but it refused to yield he
tried the window again unavailingly
then went back to the door this time it
gave for the mounting water had in-
creased the internal air-pressure and like
a cork he shot to the surface

  swallowing a mouthful of water he
found it warm and very salty it made
his many cuts and bruises smart

  he struck out for the beach not for
the nearest point but to the left so as
to have a clump of red trees between him
and the enemy though his limbs were
stiff his body was buoyant in the brine
and progress became rapid before long
he touched bottom being still some way
from the beach he would be lifted by a
plunging wave carried forward then
stand and struggle against the backwash
something soft and sticky brushed him
and stung painfully

  landing at last he found himself hid-
den from the town and the only visible
evidences of the unipeds were several of
their three-legged steeds who were watch-
ing him with such wide-eyed curiosity
that he wondered whether they would be
able to tell their masters of what they
had seen

  clearly he must find cover but before
he could make the journey to the dense
vegetation of the swamp the only place
he knew of where a man could hope to
hide he was certain to be discovered he
almost wished he had not tried the long
swim there his badly treated body would
not keep on much longer without rest if


wonder stories for august 

only the three-legged beasts would carry
him as they had before and why not
they responded to telepathic orders that
he knew why should they not obey him
as readily as their regular masters he
would try it

  concentrating his mind on the nearest
he endeavored to make it come to him at
first he was unsuccessful then he noticed
that it was uneasy looking all round an-
other effort greater concentration and it
came hesitatingly up to him in a second
he was on its back directing it to the
marshes there was no means of holding
on to that broad back and he soon found
himself falling off but the animal must
have realized his difficulty for it raised its
tail and held him in place

  making a wide detour lie saw that the
explosion had wreaked havoc on the
mushroom town the big three-pillared
building standing among a mass of ruins
fervently hoping that none of the venu-
sians hopping about beneath would see
him harley flattened himself out as much
as possible and urged the beast to hasten
suddenly though a number of mounted
unipeds came charging out of the heaped
wreckage they had seen him

  hurry harley commanded his
steed but it hesitated and stood still
after a moments cogitation it turned and
went to meet the approaching venusians
for it obeyed its familiar masters refus-
ing to heed harleys desperate commands
the tail that had kept him from falling
off now gripped like a vice he was help-
less

         chapter iv
         in the swamp

	he struggled and beat at it with his

  fists but it only increased its pace he
wished that he had something that would
serve as a weapon but everything had
been taken from him or lost but a broken
watch and a lead pencil a fragment of
glass cut his finger snatching out a jag-
ged piece he began to slash at the grip-
ping tail suddenly he found himself re-
leased and falling

  jumping up and making a desperate

dash for the bushes he felt waves of air
hot as from a furnace beat upon him
and smoke arose from the ground soon
there was a thin veil of scattered plants
between him and his pursuers then he
was altogether hidden and his feet sank
into the soft ground still he ran on once
he tripped over an outcropping root and
fell headlong another time he came on a
wide still pond and was obliged to stop
there was no sound but the stirring of
the wind in the branches and the splash
of some small creature dropping into the
water and swimming away in fright
ahead of him probably lay dangers as
great as those behind numerous small
things scurried about any one of which
might be poisonous quagmires into
which he would quickly sink to his arm-
pits lay among the shrubbery awaiting a
too hasty step

  without his noticing it the light had
faded rapidly night was falling twen-
ty-four hours before for days on venu
are only  minutes shorter than on earth
he had first landed on this planet what a
lot can happen in a day

  there was no hope of creeping up in
the dark and rescuing loted for climb-
ing a tree he saw a bright light in the
direction of the wrecked town proving
that the unipeds had some form of arti-
ficial lighting he would rest for an hour
or so and look again gathering a few
armfuls of moss and making a rough
couch he laid down in the middle of a
clump of bushes and was soon asleep in
the absolute darkness of the warm venu-
sian night once roused by a slight noise
he saw moving lights near by but he lay
perfectly still and they passed on

  scurrying across his face something
warm and furry fleeing from something
larger woke him again it was now day
lie had slept through the night his
limbs were stiff and he was furiously hun-
gry could a man find anything to eat in a
venusian forest the branches were
laden with fruit something like plums
that had been extensively gnawed by ani-
mals or insects was that any reason for
thinking he could do the same he decid-
a visit to venus



ed it wasnt but the only test was to eat
them and see they tasted watery and
sharp but not disagreeable and in sudden
desperation he made a good meal of them

  feeling somewhat better he walked out
into an open space sounds of the bending
and snapping of branches warned him
that something was coming and he ran
for shelter just as a group of green beasts
came into view each animal carrying in
its tail a dead venusian which it laid upon
the ground near harley and left at the
end of the clearing they paused and
sniffed around inquiringly then raced off
at greater speed

  a loud flapping of wings made him
look up he saw a company of gray bat-
like birds with bodies eight feet long and
wings thirty feet from tip to tip settling
down in the clearing quarreling and
fighting fiercely amongst themselves they
began to tear at the bodies with their ter-
rible teeth one of the smaller ones some-
how incurred the displeasure of a larger
who promptly slew it with several blows
of its beak then began to devour the
body soon nothing remained in the clear-
ing but the wings and beak of the eaten
bird and gray stains that had been the
life-blood of the venusians

  this then was how dead bodies were
disposed of here harley came out of his
concealment prompted by an uneasy de-
sire to know what had caught the atten-
tion of the beasts at the end of the clear-
ing the place where they had stopped to
look around was clearly indicated by the
trampled ground and running directly
to it was a line of human footsteps they
were harleys own footsteps and the
beasts had seen understood and gone to
inform their masters

	straining his ears he could hear the

   dull plop plop sometimes accompanied
by a splash that the round pads of their
feet made when in a hurry the chase
had been resumed and now there was no
hope of nightfall putting an end to it as
it had done before

  not for long could he hope to avoid
being caught by those springing racing

forms his only hope was to hide his traii
in water before he was seen he fled in
the opposite direction seeking hard
ground undergrowth anything that
would hide those tell-tale marks doubling
and using every trick he could invent but
those ominous sounds were very near
when he came without warning upon the
arm of the sea that ran through the
swamp and promptly plunged in caution
made him work his way along through
the still water under the shadow of over-
hanging plants for about a mile then he
struck out for the opposite bank some-
where in the middle something sinuous
seized his leg and tried to pull him
under

  emerging from the water he walked
across a flat expanse his feet sinking
deeper and deeper with each stride real-
izing that he was in a morass he turned
to go back but his feet had sunk nearly
to the ankles and he could not pull them
out with all his strength he strained at
his right foot it came out with a loud
squelch but the effort had driven the left
in nearly to the calf he tugged at that
and only succeeded in embedding the right
again he now saw that the yellow sur-
face here was not the same moss as in
other places but merely a thin film over
blue-black clutching mud that stank of
all the abomination imaginable

  embedded to his knees he gave up his
useless struggling and tried to think his
position over calmly overhead tantaliz-
ingly out of reach was a strong bough by
means of which could he but get hold of
it he might yet pull himself out with a
great effort he managed to get the tip of
a twig between the tips of his first and
second fingers pulling down cautiously
he drew it towards him until he had it
fairly in his hand then - the twig
snapped

  now that hope was gone he lay back
and spread out his arms so as to present
as wide a surface as possible how deep
was this pool of mud perhaps it went on
down for miles and maybe when all the
present life of both earth and venus had
passed away geologists of some future

age might find his fossilized bones far
down and argue that mankind lived on
venus before coming to the earth his
body was so deeply impressed that it took
a desperate wrench to enable him to stand
up again this trick of lying down en-
abled him to gain time but the mud must
win in the end to be drowned in mud
he thought he could face drowning in
water that was almost natural but the
thought of this stenching stuff flowing
into and choking his lungs made him
shudder

  however he soon saw that he would
not live to meet that fate for two of the
gray birds scavengers of the marshes
had seen his helpless position and flew
to the feast great jaws agape even the
unipeds were preferable to this and he
screamed aloud for help

  leather wings flapped near his head
and dagger-like teeth snapped at his eyes
he dodged and beat at them with his
hands the birds quarreled and bit at
each other in dispute over his body and
one was driven away dripping gray
blood the other resumed the attack on
the helpless man now sunk to his thighs

  tt dropped one wing as though about to
strike with it but the blow was not de-
livered the wing hanging helplessly in-
stead smoke was rising from where the
wing joined the body and the helpless
bird fell onto the marsh fortunately out
of reach of its intended victim to be in-
stantly seized in the inexorable grip

  harley turned to see who had so op-
portunely come to his rescue he expected
to see unipeds but instead the welcome
sight of his traveling companion looking
rather wild with clothing singed by fire
and plastered with mud met his gaze

  loted he called

  hello harley said that man
youve got yourself into a nice pickle
how am i to get you out 

you cant leave me if you come
closer youll sink in yourself

  nonsense i dont want to be left
alone in this unsavory world ill find
some way what about that branch above

you perhaps i could crawl along that

  new hope came to harley yes you
might be able to do that

out of the zoo

	struggling up the tree which was not

  easy to climb loted wriggled along
the branch it bent under his weight but
not far enough for harley to reach pres-
ently the two met and loted bending
down seized the other around the waist
while harley took hold of the branch and
pulled for all he was worth slowly re-
luctantly the clutching mud let its victim
go and harley struggled out and crawled
to safety

  they looked at each other

  i thought you were blown up said
loted

  and i thought the unipeds had killed
you

  it was like this explained loted
when you fired your mine - i dont
know how you did it but it was a rattling
good idea-the house i was in rocked like
a fir-tree in a storm the door of my cell
was broken open and i saw that the one-
leg outside-their bodies are quite soft
and seem to have no bones-was dead
taking his heat-ray and those of several
others who were lying around i went
into the room of the big one-leg he bolt-
ed when he saw me coming in with the
ray-guns and i wriggled through a crack
in the floor and finding that most of the
houses were blown down and their in-
mates killed slid down a post a few sur-
vivors hid among the ruins and potted at
me but i won and got away to the swamp
since then ive been wandering about un-
til i heard you yell and knew you were
still alive it sure takes a lot to kill you
harley

 what of you judging by your
clothes some of their shots must have
come near making an end of you

  well they didnt the only question i
am interested in at the moment is have
you found anything good to eat 

  yes the berries on some of these
bushes are edible and that reminds me
a visit to venus



ive got a most uncomfortable feeling in
my stomach gosh that was a spasm

  harleys digestive organs could make
nothing of the unfamiliar substances that
had been thrust upon them and present-
ly he was seized with a fit of vomiting
weakly he tottered away with loted to
a dense thicket on high ground where
they were secure from observation even
from above

  i dont think ill try your plums
said loted i had the same experience
when i killed and cooked a small animal
with a heat-ray so i know what its like
what now stay here until we starve
and the birds eat us i suppose

  i suppose so muttered harley
gloomily

  the sky was an endless dazzling white
the dense cloud-layer of venus in which
the position of the sun was shown by the
added brilliance of that region that body
was sending down heat and light nearly
double what earth receives and though
the blanketing clouds shut out much of it
they prevented the heat from escaping
and kept the planet in a state of close
damp heat that was extremely trying in
the marshy forest not a leaf stirred the
jungle seemed to wait patiently for the
deaths of these beings who had foolishly
ventured among the perils of an unfa-
miliar and hostile planet harley fancied
that he could almost feel the gaze of a
hundred hungry things waiting for the
feast

  heat and hunger combined possibly
with unfamiliar substances in his system
played tricks with harleys eyes and
brain before him a mist was rising from
the ground swirling and eddying and
wreathing itself into strange shapes in
the middle of it a large round eye ap-
peared and gazed at him in calm reflec-
tive fashion and around the eye the
mist shaped itself into an apparently solid
body it had two legs similar to but more
slender than those of the unipeds and its
oval body was draped with a purple ma-
terial on which were many designs other-
wise it was much like the unipeds

	into harleys mind came the idea of
gentle amusement as though they were
being laughed at then a telepathic mes-
sage

  i do not admire your manner of wel-
coming one who has come to rescue you
aiming a ray-gun at me however i do
not advise you to use it for while you
cannot harm me you might start a fire
from which you would have difficulty in
escaping actually many miles from this
spot i am using a thought-projector to
throw my picture into your minds so that
you think that you can see me

  who are you  demanded harley

  a representative of the rulers of
venus

  then the unipeds-

  like their green beasts said the vi-
sion and the red trees they exist only in
this one spot which we keep as a zoo it
was unfortunate that you should land in
this very place but really you know you
have only yourselves to blame for you
tried to keep your visit secret and no
arrangements were made to receive you
seeing you land in the very worst place
you could have chosen and watching
your subsequent adventures has been the
biggest joke venus has enjoyed for
years

  you have been watching us

  the whole time in telescopes and the
show has been relayed to every native
home on the planet but our telescopes
are more complicated than anything you
have conceived you would call them tele-
vision sets we thank you for an excel-
lent entertainment and in return we res-
cue you from your troubles leave your
guns on the ground and follow me
some subtle force from the figure made
them obey unquestioningly as it led them
now floating several inches in the air and
now with round feet hidden beneath the
ground through the marshes on the
way they crossed a glade where three
unipeds who were following loteds
tracks mounted as usual on green beasts
bolted in terror from their guide at last
reaching an open space where the ground
was firm they saw before them a cube


wonder stories for august 

twenty feet each way seemingly of porce-
lain the color of new leaves there was a
door in it beside which stood a creature
similar to their guide wearing a red robe

  half expecting the whole mirage to
vanish harley put a tentative foot inside
it was certainly material they entered
forthwith the bushes and trees and all
the varied life of the swamp dropped
away below them for so perfect were the
driving machines that one was uncon-
scious of any movement now they were
looking down on the valley with its coiled
arm of sea and shattered mushroom town
the landscape trembled hesitated then
began to flow steadily to the east

  within the cube was one compartment
and the green walls though opaque from
outside were transparent from within
beneath their feet far below was the
sea so clear that looking down produced
unpleasant sensations of falling and ver-
tigo the three venusians tending the
green metal machinery in the center of
the floor ignored the earthmen complete-
ly even when harley tried to question
them

  it was impossible to judge how far
they had traveled when at last they came
upon a land green with fertility and
landed

  am i dreaming demanded loted
suddenly gripping harley by the arm
that tree looks exactly like an earth-oak
to me

  it is an oak said harley and there
is a maple and a fir see that that was
a rabbit and theres a pigeon

  we shouldnt starve here murmured
loted softly and personally i should
like to get away from these things who
are looking after us i dont altogether
trust them are you game to escape i
believe we could open the door and slide
away before they missed us

  harley assenting they casually pushed
open the door and walked quickly but
quietly across genuine grass as ou earth
in a few moments they were concealed
and looked back to see the green cube
sliding softly as a soap bubble into the
sky

  we were meant to get out here said
harley

  so it seems agreed loted

chapter v
human guinea-pigs

	pushing their way through a regular
thicket of laurel they came with star-
tling suddenness upon a path running
around a plot of cabbages set out in neat
rows beyond the cabbages a field of
blue-flowered potatoes peeped at them
through currant bushes

  some earthinan planted these de-
clared harley

  at that moment a white-haired man
inclining to stoutness appeared walking
thoughtfully along the path towards them
he wore a suit of ail old-fashioned cut
so patched and darned that it was nearly
falling off him

  pleasant weather he observed
these confounded rabbits play hell with
the cabbages

  they now observed that he carried a
hoe in one hand and a cunningly contrived
snare in the other

  we are strangers here said loted
only just arrived

  indeed said the stranger looking
them over yes come to think of it ive
not seen you before all i can say is that
youve got your clothes into a nice mess
already what are they going to be like
when youve been here thirty years as i
have 

can we get food and drink here
have you got any money otherwise
youll have to give me an i o u for
prices rule rather high here you know

  it happened that loted was well pro-
vided with currency notes but harley
had to ask for credit payment having
been made in advance their host led them
to a medium-sized bungalow of bricks
and stone and soon laid a meal before
them a meal lacking in many of the lux-
uries to which loted was accustomed but
at the moment he was not disposed to be
critical

  the only drink here i am sorry to
a visit to venus



say said their new friend is water
though we all at times sigh for those
three dear old curses of earth alcohol to-
bacco and tea i am sure we are better
without them especially tea since being
forced to the frugal fare of venus we
have all been free from the dyspepsia that
troubled us on earth i f ever i got back i
should lead a big campaign against tea
cause of half the ills man is heir to

 there are some annoying incon-
veniences that we have to put up with
he went on chattily for instance we
cannot produce glass and have to be con-
tent with holes for windows fortunately
however the climate is usually too hot for
windows

  are there many people here  queried
harley his mouth full of stewed rabbit

  about thirty all male every time a
space-ship sets out for mars or venus it
finds its way here in the end but the kind
attentions of our venusian masters pre-
vent our numbers from becoming un-
wieldy they intend to colonize earth
and keep us here for purposes of experi-
ment and observation oh yes they are
taking a long time about it they say that
the whole scheme of life on earth has to
be altered before they can get a secure
foothold

  they work in secret and dont intend
to lose any venusian lives over the busi-
ness if they can help it it seems that the
various forms of life on a planet are so
interdependent that no high form can
flourish without a myriad of lower forms
to support it quite apart from the food
question there are bacteria viruses and
even smaller things than that without
which man could not survive beyond a
generation and the same is true of the
venusians

  harley explained earths trouble with
gigantism and acromegaly

  probably one of their minute cultures
is the cause of it they try them on us
then if they prove successful they in-
troduce them to earth i understand that
their method is to carry spheres full of
spores and drop them into the atmosphere
the spores are practically indestructible

and the containing spheres are so light
and fragile that they sink slowly and
the wind rends them to fragments in the
denser strata of the atmosphere thus
they are slowly establishing venusian life
upon earth some die out quickly some
last longer but they tell us every step
for they do not conceal their plans from
us makes others easier foundations are
steadily being laid even the larger things
are now engaging their attention al-
ready several earth species have been de-
stroyed and one or two venusian plants
firmly established

	my god you are right  exclaimed

  harley leaning back and staring at
him i have only this moment realized
that the pear-tree we passed on our way
to this house is the first living one i have
seen for years that mysterious disease
yellow canker destroyed them all to
find a healthy one on venus now i re-
member reading an article by a scientist
in which he remarked on the exceptional
activity of nature in the last century or
so in evolving new plants many of them
without any apparent relationship to pre-
viously known species and that swamp
didnt you notice it loted that some of
the smaller plants were familiar though
i was too occupied at the time to realize
it

  plants first said their host then
animals and the next step- he spread

his hands

  after lunch he led them to a small
room without windows the floor walls
and ceiling of which were lined with lead

  this my friends is the only place on
the island where we can talk without fear
of being heard and understood by the
venusians in the machines they use
while outside i always pretend to be
helplessly resigned to the plans of these
beasts but here i can reveal my plans
earth shall not succumb without a blow
being struck for her i know for a fact
that nothing they have introduced to
earth will long survive in competition
with the natural life of the planet cut of
the supply and they will disappear one by


wonder stories for august 

one till about a hundred years will see
the last of them die out and there is a
way of stopping the supply yes there is
a way of destroying the venusians and of
bringing the domination of earth to
venus yes sirs there is a way and i-
i have found it they breed strange
deadly forms of life but two can play at
that game sir two can play at that game
i have evolved a monster

  he glanced furtively about then con-
tinued in a hoarse excited whisper

  yes i have created a terrible thing it
looks innocent enough and peaceful so
peaceful but its powers its bite is poi-
son  it breeds rapidly it will burrow
through the ground and through the walls
of their houses it will devour their crops
and their food it will break the power of
venus

  now when i take you out and show
them to you mind you reveal nothing of
your thoughts in your faces and gestures
for we must be circumspect circum-
spect they must never suspect earths
reply to their schemes lefore the time
comes

  blowing out the smoky oil lamp he led
them into the garden and showed them a
stone pen down into which he invited
them to look through the wire mesh
hardly daring to breathe they ap-
proached and saw-running about within
and heedless of their presence-six white
mice

  they smiled and winked and nodded
after the fashion of people sharing a
great secret then wandered away in
search of more congenial company soon
they found another man old and stout as
the first to whom they talked and told
their story

  so youve been talking to the chief
biologist have you of course though
we call him that to please him he is
really quite mad and hardly any wonder
either when you remember that hes been
here thirty years the longest i have ever
known anyone to remain sane here was
twenty everything else he told you is
correct for he is fairly lucid on almost

anything except those silly white mice of

his

  now there is one thing i must tell
you mind i am not annoyed with you i
recognize that you are strangers here and
sinned in ignorance so i am prepared to
overlook it but in the future when you
speak to me you must address me as
your majesty i happen to be king of
venus all the venusians do as i tell
them and i hope to establish a dynasty
and maybe extend its realms to include
earth as to this business of venus colo-
nizing the earth i gave orders for that
to be stopped long ago

  they apologized to his majesty and
departed

  is there no sane man here groaned
harley

  unfortunately yes said a voice from
the other side of a loganberry bush i
believe i am one

  the speaker proved to be a man in a
wheel-chair the hands resting on his lap
were little more than skin and bone his
face presented the shriveled dried-up ap-
pearance of age yet the eyes were those
of a young man

  why harley he croaked my old
chum martin harley how do you come
to be in this place of despair

desperote ptons

	startled harley recognized grumbolt

  lowther who had been the football
captain in the same college in which har-
ley had been educated

  we set out for venus said lowther
some twelve years ago hoping to help
humanity but we have become instru-
ments of evil instead they take each of
us in turn try this culture and that on
him until they find something harmful
only a few of our original crew still live
and those have purchased their right to
exist at the cost of their sight or hearing
or sanity or a multitude of unpleasant
sores every man something tell me
has this trouble of mine appeared at home
yet

  not to my knowledge said harley
but loted was better informed
a visit to venus



  a disease with symptoms similar to
yours has shown itself on earth he de-
clared i know because i floated a com-
pany to market a cure but it has not ob-
tained a real hold patients usually re-
cover after awhile

  thank heaven for that the sufferer
closed his eyes for a moment in relief
then he went on how delighted we
were when we found ourselves nearing
venus and a huge semi-transparent octo-
gon ship met us informing us that we
were the first travelers to make the jour-
ney  they asked us to follow them prom-
ising a grand reception and presently we
found they could communicate with us
without the aid of any apparatus on our
ship by means of those cursed telepathic
machines of theirs then we discovered
too late that we were helpless to resist
the directions they transmitted in this
manner and compelled to disembark
here we found an earth colony already
established and saw our vessel taken
away since then we have been little tat-
ter than automatons we grow our food
and live our lives on this island but we
are watched the whole time and none of
us knows when the summons may come
for him to walk away to one of their
green cubes to be carried to their lab-
oratory and experimented on we are
even afraid to plan resistance for we
never know when they are reading our
thoughts  

  loted and harley were accepted into
the melancholy little community the
earth colony of venus heroes all at one
time some of the boldest spirits earth
could produce who had voluntarily of-
fered their lives in the great adventure
they now dragged out a miserable exist-
ence hopeless apathetic prisoners of
venusian masters on the island which
was some fifteen miles in diameter with-
out power or machinery and niggardly
supplied with metals they lived simple
primitive lives all their energy expended
in feeding and sheltering themselves
they lived for their dreams of the past
tired men waiting their turns to find rest

in the cemetery that slowly spread on the
side of the hill the supply of seeds and
young plants and animals was replenished
from time to time by the venusians for
the second generation of earth life on
venus lacked vitality as did men who
had been there for many years how
these supplies were obtained without the
knowledge of earth was a mystery    

  the colonists kept up a semblance of a
social system in miniature ased on the
money they happened to have with them
there was a legislative assembly and a
court of justice where such important
questions were tried as was a entitled
to construct a fowl-house in such a man-
ner as to keep the sun off bs washing

  some grew potatoes others wheat
others dug clay and baked bricks all sold
their commodities and purchased what
they needed from the others thus money
fulfilled its purpose as a medium of ex-
change and passed from hand to hand
until coins were worn smooth and notes
illegible there had been some discon-
tent over the unequal distribution of
wealth but after the fortunate ones had
spent a day or so in idleness this righted
itself for their money was spent and
they had to set to work like the rest one
individual had cornered soap but the
whole community went without washing
for several days and the price of soap
came down

	harley having no money went to

  work in the brick works until he could
achieve independence loted revealed the
large supplies of notes he had planned to
take to england with him there was
enough to support him in comfort and
idleness for many years and he looked
forward to a life of ease supported by the
labor of others but the other members
of the colony put their heads together and
enacted a law whereby the rate of ex-
change should be one hundred and fifty
dollar notes issued after  to one dol-
lar gold or paper issued before that date
thus the value of loteds money was
drastically reduced the risk of heavy de-
preciation of the original money avoided


wonder stories for august 

and the power of finance for once de-
feated loted waxed eloquent about the
iniquity of deliberate class legisla-
tion 

	personally i dont believe it said
harley without pausing in his work of
stacking the clay blocks for burning

  believe what asked lowther ma-
neuvering his wheels to get around a tuft
of grass

  the phenomenal powers you ascribe
to these venusians i admit that they can
see us from a distance that they can in-
fluence mans actions while far away and
you have convinced me they can read our
thoughts when we are near their ma-
chines but i refuse to believe that they
know everything that passes through our
minds when we are far from those ma-
chines

  dont work too hard old chap or
youll soon have made all the bricks we
want and then youll be unemployed i
dont believe it myself

  for a while harley worked in silence

  what about trying to escape  i know
it will be dangerous but what if we do
lose our lives in trying we have little
enough to look forward to

  steady old chap theres plenty of
time most of the men are cowards but
some of us five in all think as you do
and are ready for the attempt i will un-
dertake to be responsible for you and to
let you know our secret plans can you
vouch for this man loted

  i can

  very well we never meet together
more than two at a time lest we attract
attention now listen to me sooner or
later either loted or yourself will be
taken to the experimental laboratory
until your coming we were beginning to
fear that one of us would have to undergo
the experience a second time but you
have eased our minds in that respect for
a while at least not very far from here
is a building like a huge chimney like
those chimneys one sees in ruins of old
factories on earth only far larger it is
built upon a hill and its summit rises far

above the clouds supporting a platform
larger than a square mile on which the
laboratory buildings are situated i was
there some years ago when i contracted
this complaint of mine and as i was be-
ing brought back this is our secret trump-
card i managed to take away the pistol
of one of the venusians without him no-
ticing it for clever as they are they are
sometimes guilty of what in a man we
should call absent-mindedness this is our
plan when the green ship comes the
member of the committee who sees it
will go to the apple tree nearest this
quarry and near the trunk he will see a
ring in the ground pull up that ring and
the pistol will be seen lying in a tin box

  that pistol gives forth putrefaction-
rays when the button is pressed you will
understand the effect of it when i tell you
that i killed a rabbit with it and the body
was as though it had been dead a week
once we can get to that elevated labora-
tory there is a room in it housing the
controls of the interplanetary transmitter
i saw a venusian operate it by closing a
switch similar to what sets the green ships
in motion we can get to that room and
send a warning to earth

  i hope i am next to go cried harley
his eyes aflame i shall carry that pistol
you will do nothing of the sort for
they will read your intentions in your
brain before you enter no we must cap-
ture a green ship pilot it there then make
a surprise attack on them

  you have possessed this deadly weap-
on for years said harley thoughtfully
yet you have made no move till now
do not judge us too harshly old man
most of us are sadly incapacitated and
there is something in this place that saps
the energy and will of a man as you
will know in time we sadly needed a
fresh influx of life and spirit

 he wheeled himself away harley
passed on the information to loted and a
period of monotonous waiting began for
the committee it was a pathetic commit-
tee one was blind one deaf one had
valvular disease of the heart and might
fall dead at any moment and the last had
a visit to venus



but one arm his other having dropped off
bit by bit

  days passed meeting loted near the
beehives harley spoke to him without
getting a reply then saw that he walked
unseeingly like a man in a trance the
summons had come to him

  the period of waiting was at an end
the time for action had come a glance
at the sky did not reveal the green cube
but doubtless it was there hidden by
foliage searching hastily for other mem-
bers of the committee he found the one-
armed man and the blind man

  unfortunately said the blind man
i am but little use in a fight in my day
i feared nothing and it is the same with
most of us but i will be there you two
take the gun and i will tell the others

  a few moments later harley lay on
his face among the currant bushes and
watched the open space where the cube
always landed in the middle of the field
stood the unconscious financier waiting
to be carried away

chapter vi
warning the earth

	noiseless as thistledown the beautiful

  polished vessel drifted to a resting-
place before them dimly through the
walls they could see the machinery in-
side and the three oval-bodied venusians
tending it

  will the ray operate through the
walls whispered harley anxiously

  they will come out returned his
companion better let me have the gun
i have practised with it and know how to
focus it so as to bring down our quarry
without killing the man as well if i can
ill miss him if i cant hell be un-
lucky

  true to his predictions the three venu-
sians came out and stood by the open
door harley thought it an insolent ges-
ture of power to expose themselves so
recklessly

  you could get them all now he mur-
mured

  the one-armed man muttered impreca-

tions pm trying to but i cant get the
gun to work i cant understand it

  a sleek beautiful wood-pigeon sailing
in graceful ease to a landing before them
suddenly crumpled in the air and fell in
an untidy heap

  the ray is working all right said
harley in a tone of utter despair

  i might have known it groaned his
companion the chemical structure of
venusian bodies is so different from ours
that this weapon is designed to have no
effect on them no wonder they never
troubled about our possession of it when
it would harm only ourselves

  as the green vessel floated away per-
fectly unharmed he cast the useless pis-
tol from him and rose up among the cur-
rant bushes he was weeping with the
abandon of a child

  i hoped before i died to see earth
strike a blow at the dominance of venus
but now i know that i never shall soon
the mortification that has robbed me of
my arm will reach my heart and i have
clung to life fought to live for this day-
to be disappointed

	 

  of all this naturally the abducted fin-
ancier knew nothing perfectly conscious
and aware of his surroundings his body
was out of his control as it carried him
against his will to the landing-field it
was not until the venusians had arrived
that he realized what was happening ex-
pecting every moment to see them col-
lapse he struggled against his rebellious
muscles to keep back out of the way of
destruction but nothing happened he
had a few unpleasant moments when he
knew he must be in the line of fire then
cursing in his mind the cowardliness of
the dilatory committee he was being car-
ried to unknown perils to be a subject for
fiendish science terror terror of the un-
known possessed him like the fear people
have of a first operation under anaesthet-
ics but unhappily without the comforting
assurance of the good intentions of the
surgeon

  still he was able to take an interest in
his surroundings in a minute or so they


wonder stories for august 

were above the cloud envelope bathed in
blinding light and looking down on a
white floor that stretched limitless in
every direction and looked as though a
man might walk upon it it was hard to
believe that this was not the real surface
of the planet many miles of this monoto-
nous expanse they traversed until they
came to the landmark so often described
to him a slender pole rising high out of
the clouds with at the top a platform
bearing buildings

  marvelling he stared at this unbeliev-
able feat of engineering the advantages
for the purposes of astronomy of its posi-
tion he realized at once but he wondered
what happened to the precarious structure
in the event of a violent storm or an
earthquake it was so extremely top-
heavy so clearly did he formulate the
question that the venusians perceived it
and replied by telepathy

  a storm they told him would affect
only a relatively small portion of the staff
and would hardly be felt while in the
event of an earthquake the staff would
not sway as a whole but the shock would
travel upwards giving those at the top
ample warning

	as they approached loted saw that

  the first appearance of smallness and
slenderness had been deceptive for the
platform had an area of more than a
square mile the support being proportion-
ately huge still guided by that mysteri-
ous influence he stepped out of the cube
and walked over the rough surface to the
buildings extremely rough floors seemed
to afford good foothold for the wide pads
that were the feet of these creatures but
made it hard work for the financier who
was breathing heavily by the time he com-
pleted the half-mile to the center building
of the elevated village

  enter creature of earth it was a
deep bass voice and woke loted sharply
to alertness two of his conductors seized
his arms in their whipcord tentacles and
guided him through a door which prompt-
ly closed shutting them out

  he looked around it was a lofty spa-

cious room lit with red-tinted light with
ridges running across the floors and many
ornamental pillars three purple-robed
venusians awaited his arrival

  approach said the bass voice it was
a voice and came from a corrugated
sounding-board on his left obeying with-
out hesitation he advanced towards two
machines suggestive of searchlights from
one to the other of which stretched a pale
blue haze when he reached the exact
center of this haze a sharp command di-
rected him to stop now he could feel his
mind being pried into and knew that his
conscious thoughts were open to inspec-
tion accordingly he concentrated on the
idea of how great and powerful the venu-
sians were for he was a tactful man

  we thank you for your compliments
said the voice loted wondered which of
them directed the reply but they had a
deceptive appearance of taking no interest
in him or in anything else of doing noth-
ing they ignored him as completely as
they did the perfect working model won-
derfully made of the solar system that
spun unsupported and unheeded over
their heads

  we were particularly interested in
you went on the voice because you are
a living example of the effect one of our
preparations is having on earth we see
that your body is growing out of shape
and that the condition is gradually weak-
ening you in a way that will ultimately be
fatal however it will not prevent us
from making use of you

  sweat broke out on loteds brow for
to the last moment he had hoped that he
would escape the usual fate do you
mean to use me for your experiments
he asked hoarsely

  certainly you were not asked to
come here and you must pay for your
footing you may not die as a result of
our activities there is quite a chance
that your condition may be fatal before
our efforts are

  wait a moment i am an important
man on earth i may be useful to you

  how can you be useful to us
a visit to venus



by describing to you the ways the
weapons and the resources of earth
your treachery would be idle already
we know more about that than you do
it came to him in a flash of inspira-
tion the way to save himself

  there is some important information
i can give you he cried

  now he knew that he had them inter-
ested what is this information  we
see that you genuinely believe it to be im-
portant to us

  can you cure my acromegaly

  if we wish to

  do you promise to cure me not to ex-
periment on me but to allow me to live
in comfort even to protect me from the
vengeance of my fellows in return for
the information 

  if it is important we will

  he described the plans of the commit-
tee named the members told of the pos-
session of the gun and described its hid-
ing place one of the three venusians
went out

  as it happens the plot would be
harmless but for their temerity in imag-
ining such a thing your committee men
will all meet a particularly unpleasant fate
in a few hours enter that room on the
right

  something snapped in loteds brain
these things were double-crossing him
a man accustomed to treachery who
broke faith as naturally as other men eat
he knew from the mocking undertone
the subtle flavor of triumph in the thought
waves that reached him that his captors
meant to dishonor their words a black
flood of fury filled his mind driving out
all fear all reason he leapt madly at the
nearest venusian

a finol act

	now every intention that came into his
mind every plan he formed was re-
vealed to the venusians by the vibrations
of the machine so that they always had
notice of what he was about to do had
he harbored the slightest thought the
slightest desire to attack them they would
have known and been on their guard but

now by the merest fluke by the mere
fact of conceiving his rage and acting on
it at the same instant he achieved the
seeming impossible he took the bipeds
by surprise it was a possibility that they
had not foreseen as completely an acci-
dent as the falling of a tile from a roof
onto some ones head that a man should
act entirely without meditation

  seizing a whipcord tentacle in one
hand he wrenched at it and swung blind-
ly with his other fist at the body he
pulled towards him his hand burst
through the skin with a soft pop and
gray fluid poured from the eyes and
breathing-holes turning on the other in
the same instant he aimed at it a furious
kick that threw him backwards the mu-
tilated corpse on top of him

  both venusians lay dead and loted
still holding the arm he had torn away
from the body of the first looked at them
and at the spreading stains and wondered
what had happened there was a fright-
ful pain in his left arm and he vaguely
remembered seeing the aiming light of a
ray-gun resting on it for a second it
smelt-vile from mid-forearm down his
arm was dead and putrefaction was well
advanced

  reason told him that a man could not
live for more than a minute or so with a
limb far gone in decay for the blood
would carry the poisons all over his body

  revenge he had a few seconds to re-
venge himself by wreaking all the harm
he could on these things the interplan-
etary transmitter he would warn the
earth

  madly he raced down the corridor fol-
lowing half-remembered directions given
him by men who were now doomed to
death by his own act abruptly he found
himself before a great mass of apparatus
the switch he found and closed it

  he did not know the interplanetary
code but that didnt matter for he could
speak in english trusting to the opera-
tor at the other end to make a record of
the sounds if he did not know that lan-
guage himself

the return of tyme

by a fedor
and henry hasse

	late on the afternoon of april 
 a person walked into the private
office of b lue pencil editor-in-chief
of future fiction the editor was sur-
prised and not a little curious for this
person was none other than john s mith
dt head of the department of science
at the john bopkins university

  professor mith lost no time in explain-
ing the purpose of his call and once he
had started speaking he did not stop until
he had said everything he wanted to say

  you will no doubt be surprised mr
pencill to learn that for nearly five years
i have been a constant reader of your
magazine future fiction i am also a
steady reader of another magazine of the
same type stupendous stories it is not
generally known but this type of fiction
has always been peculiarly fascinating to
me but a year and a half ago i began
to realize that scientific fiction was on
the decline and i was sorry it continued
on the decline so i began immediately to
write a novel the idea for which i had
had in mind for some years all of my
spare time and energy for the last year
and a half has gone into this novel and
last week i finished it

  now  firmly believe mr pencill that
this novel will be the epic of all science-
fiction stories of all time in fact it is
bound to start a new era in science-fiction
writing i have it with me now 
words and the title of it is the core
i wish you would read it i think that you
will not only agree that it fits your maga-
zine but that you will be most enthusiastic
about purchasing it for immediate publi-
cation i think you will find that it will
increase your circulation  per cent

  	here at last ia the long-awaited
  sequel to the end of tyme which
  appeared in our number for november
   that time-travel burlesque that jrou
  liked so well

     you will remember that in the original
   story tyme the visitor from the twenty-
   third century was thrown into an asylum
   for declaring that he had traveled in
   time but he mysteriously escaped

     in the sequel we find that r lue pen-
   cill the editor-in-chief of future fic-
   tion is very despondent-in fact so
   much so that he is about to end it all-
   for the depression had taken its toll on
   his beloved publication and he wanted
   to die before the magazine

    but we also solve the mystery of
  tymes sudden disappearance from the
  asylum which greatly affects the situa-
  tion

     this story will amuse you even more
   than the end of tyme and proves a
   fitting sequel

  i left this story with the editor of
stupendous stories last week and called
for it today he offered me outright c
per word for the magazine rights you
may wonder why i did not accept the
truth is mr pencill i would very much
rather see this story in future fiction it
is a much nicer magazine from the stand-
point of appearance-better paper print
artists and so forth however i do be-
lieve that future fiction has for the past
two years printed the worst science-fiction
of any magazine i am being perfectly
frank with you i want to help you and
your magazine mr pencill i am offering
you an unparalleled opportunity to raise
your publication  per cent in circula-
tion not to mention  per cent in the
opinions and good will of your readers
you see mr pencil i have the utmost
confidence that my story will do just that

  the editor of stupendous thought so
too apparently for he remonstrated ex-


wonder stories for august 

ceedingly against my submitting the
core to any other magazine than his own
but mr pencil if you are in a position
to also offer me c per word the story
is yours otherwise i shall be compelled
much against my will to let it go to
stupendous at that price but i think
that together we can bring science-fiction
out of the nit and can elevate your mag-
azine to the highest place in science-fiction
literature

   wish you would read the core
thoughtfully and in a week i will call
again to hear your decision

  after this long speech john s mith
dt placed a portfolio on the desk be-
fore the dumbfounded pencill and with
a final good day left

	when the editor had sufficiently recov-
ered he burst forth into speech which
was a bit stronger than vociferous to say
the least of all the inimitable gall three
cents per word indeed if he paid c per
word for an  word story he would
have to postpone publication of future
fiction for six months or forever of
course publication of the story would in-
crease the circulation more than some-
what the name of professor mith alone
would be sufficient reason for that but c
per word- for one story-was
beyond range of pencills conception

  nevertheless ht took the manuscript
home that evening having decided to read
it if only to see whether or not the pro-
fessors colossal confidence in it was jus-
tified seated in his favorite easy chair
pencill turned his attention to the thick
manuscript the title the core imme-
diately aroused his curiosity so without
further ado he plunged straightway into
his task

  a very pleasant kind of task indeed
mr pencill was aware before very long
he read nearly a third of the manuscript
that night continued to read it at the of-
fice the next day and for the second night
took it home where he finished it

  pencill was amazed he was stupefied
it was all professor mith had said and
more it was the most stupendous thing

pencill had ever read the core-the
core of worlds-the connecting route of
all the worlds on all the other planes
higher as our plane is the lowest the
natural passage between our earth and
simultaneously the worlds of all the
other planes aforementioned intangible
as the ether yet capable of being
traveled constantly shifting over the
surface of our earth sometimes fading
into non-existence depending upon the
natural conditions caused in part by vi-
bration and the gravitational attraction
of the moon and of any other planets
which might have any stress on the par-
ticular side of earth where the core
is existent at the time shifting fading
existent under only the most delicate con-
ditions going on the blink when the hero
wishes to travel it most so that he has
to wait for the natural conditions to return
to the core

  nor was the story subordinated by the
science the plot was unique thrilling
tense pencill was more wildly enthusiastic
over it than he had ever dreamed he could
be over any story to merely say that it
was great would be like calling the
grand canyon cute it was a new kind
of science-fiction it was science-fiction
revolutionized it was cosmic in its scope
yet at no time beyond comprehension
pencill could now well understand pro-
fessor miths meaning when he had stated
that this story would start a new era
in science-fiction writing

  but alter his immediate enthusiasm
had somewhat waned the editor became
very sad his magazine would not be the
one to lead in this new era for the first
time there dawned upon him the realiza-
tion that he could not possibly by any
stretch of his present financial status
buy that story lie needed no careful esti-
mate of future fictions finances to know
that it was hopeless to hope

	nevertheless the next day at the office

  he looked carefully into his private
books and then it was that he was
plunged into utter despair things were
very much worse than he had imagined
the return of tyme



he had enough available funds to pay
about one-fourth of the price of the
core he wasnt thinking of that story
now though but of his magazine he
could issue it for a few more months per-
haps it was certain that he couldnt finish
out the year as he had hoped by then
he had thought conditions would surely
have improved business would have be-
gun to come into its own again he had
been hard hit by the depression of course
as had everyone else but he hadnt
dreamed subscriptions could drop so low
he had realized that there was gradually
approaching a crisis but hadnt thought
that it was so near

  so future fiction was finished for-
gotten now was the core forgotten
now was everything but the fact that he
had founded a magazine a long time ago
had put much money and much work and
much hope into it and now it and he
were to fail he didnt understand even
now how it could have happened he
thought he had always done his best

  he looked back tried to see how this
had come about-looked back to the first
reviewed the good years the fair years
the not-so-good years up to a period
just six or eight months ago those last
six or eight months were particularly out-
standing  his mind he had never be-
fore encountered such a bunch of unap-
preciative readers as he had in that time
they seemed to take an unholy delight in
voicing their many grievances in the
reader shrieks but pencill took none
of them seriously readers didnt mean
half of what they said of course pencill
had always printed as many of the letters
as he had room for the praises and the
pannings alike he prided himself upon
being that much of an editor

  as he looked back now he could see
that one particularly vociferous reader
had started the whole thing by again rais-
ing the cry that is a bane to every editors
cars we want reprints often pencill
would awake in the night sweating from
the awful nightmare of those words he
remembered now that he had printed this
vociferous readers letter together with a

footnote in which he explained the utter
financial impossibility of reprints such
stories he explained were copyrighted
and the cost of reprinting even one of
them would necessitate leaving out all the
ther stories he already had scheduled to
appear the majority of the readers
wouldnt like that and besides the authors
at present writing for future fiction liad
to live though he never explained why
pencill had hoped that would hold him
but this particular reader was witty-
oh very witty he had a snappy come-
back for every occasion

  youre only the editor was his voci-
ferous retaliation on this occasion who
are you to say what the readers would
like they would rather have one re-
print each issue than five or six of the
kind of stories you have been giving us
and speaking of the authors at present
writing for future fiction having to live
i understand from reliable authority that
they get paid scandalous rates that is
why stupendous stories gets the best
stories and you get the worst yours de-
fiantly - p s the trouble with

you is that you always evade the issue
yes said pencill to himself after read-
ing this one im only the editor -- and
straightway took half a box of headache
tablets

  he had printed this letter too he now
remembered for he had rather liked the
fellows courage in saying straight out
what he meant in the footnote after the
letter he had dismissed the whole thing
in a few cursory words

  which was his mistake things then
rather broke loose

  evading the issue the readers cried
taking sides with the one who had started
it everyone had seemed to think that it
was his particular duty to send in his pro-
test to the reader shrieks the thing
had finally died out and pencill had gone
on printing the stories by the authors at
present writing for future fiction

	pencill sat in his office now thinking
over these past years and months the
magazine he had founded raised and


wonder stories for august 

nurtured had always seemed something
more to him than an inanimate mass of
pulp it had been more like an intimate
friend and now it was as though that
friend were going to die were going to
leave him alone and friendless

  and then came the great thought it
came like a flash and pencill lost no time
in acting with an air of finality he
walked to the door of the outer office
it was past five-thirty and everyone had
long since gone home but very silently
he closed and locked the door retiring
into his private office he silently locked
that door also now that the great
thought had come he could see that this
way was best at least the magazine
would outlive him for within a very few
minutes he would be no more 

  he put the core back into the folio
penned a brief note of appreciation to
professor mith and placed it with the
manuscript that done he opened the
top drawer of his desk and gingerly lift-
ed out a blue steel automatic which he
had made it a habit always to keep there
he wasnt very adept at handling fire-
arms and wondered which was the prop-
er way to do that which he was about to
do

  delicately but with much resolution
he pointed the muzzle in the general di-
rection of his head he really meant to
pull the trigger-for he was very sincere
in his purpose-but he never did

  for the very instant his finger tight-
ened there appeared to be some sort of
disturbance of the air directly in front
of him accompanied by a queer kind of
humming pencill hesitated for one in-
stant

  and in that instant tyme arrived

  did you ever see a man suddenly ma-
terialize out of the thin air directly in
front of you directly on the spot where
you had been looking at nothing the in-
stant before  if not you must try it some
time it must be a very astonishing spec-
tacle thats what happened to b lue
pencill and it so astonished him that he
immediately forget about suicide and
suicide is a very hard thing to forget

about immediately especially when you
are about to commit it

  the editors arm dropped to his side
and he said nothing this was very appro-
priate for he had absolutely nothing to
say he was thinking though this re-
minded him very much of a similar occa-
sion some time ago on that occasion he
had been menaced by a lunatic in this very
office in fact this fellow who now con-
fronted him looked very much like that
same lunatic

  on the floor beside tyme was a large
tall bundle

  tyme spoke first i hope i did not
startle you mr pencill the last time
if you remember you did not witness my
actual arrival so believed me a lunatic
and had me placed in an asylum this
time however  think you did witness my
arrival for you were looking directly at
me when i materialized

  yes pencill replied not the least bit
of concern in his voice but i was a bit
startled i recognize you now by your
voice you are that same lunatic who re-
lated preposterous stories to me in this
very office some months ago at that time
i had you placed in an asylum but you
managed to escape and have probably been
running loose ever since and further-
more the editor went on recklessly i
do not care to listen to any more of your
stories today i dont know how you got
in here this time any more than you did
last time but do you realize young man
-motioning with the revolver he still held
in his hand-that you interrupted a
very important event

  but tyme did not heed pencills words
if indeed he heard them at all for his at-
tention was now centered upon the au-
tomatic the editor held and which tyme
recognized as one of the ancient weapons

  tell me mr pencill tyme began
anxiously that weapon you have in your
hand - revolver or automatic i believe
they called them were you about to-
to-

  about to use it pencill broke in
my dear mr tyme or whatever your
name is i was indeed about to put it to
the return of tyme



very good use if you wish to leave i
will unlock the door for you or you may
stay if you wish though i imagine the
sight of a man shooting himself isnt ex-
actly a pleasant one

  tyme was aghast suicide was virtual-
ly an unknown art in his time and that a
man should wilfully want to take his
cwn life was very hard for him to believe

  how very fortunate that i decided to
come back he exclaimed how very
fortunate that i arrived just when i did
but of course i couldnt have arrived at
any other time could i you alone
about to commit suicide the doors locked
and no one else present to prevent the act
-so indeed it must have been no one else
but myself who stopped you for the act
uas prevented of course you didnt shoot
yourself you see it didnt happen that
way you went on living you continued
to edit your magazine

  what nonsense exclaimed pencill
now very much convinced that this per-
son was indeed a lunatic continued to
edit my magazine indeed it wont last
another three months thats why im end-
ing it all i dont want to be bothered by
your nonsensical stories young man and
if you think that you or anyone else is
going to stop me from doing this last
thing youre very much mistaken stand
back young man-as tyme took a step
toward him with that pencill again
raised the gun to his head

	mr pencill wait please just one
minute  tyme was so very much agi-
tated now his voice rising to a queer fal-
setto his hands gesticulating wildly his
expression so ludicrous that pencill would
surely have laughed had not the situation
been so serious i implore you mr pen-
cill to listen to me for just one minute
if you do this thing it might upset the
whole universe countless lives count-
less worlds are at stake you lived until
-i think it was that year-at which
time you were killed in an auto accident
you see it didnt-it mustnt-happen
this way stop and think-think what
might be the results of tampering with

the delicate scheme of hungs stop and
think of the countless upon countless of
millions of suns and planets in space
stop and think of them swerving speed-
ing crashing all because of the pressure
of your finger upon that trigger stop
and think of the universe wiped out stop
and think of the cataclysmic destruction
stop and think of the cosmic chaos stop
and think of the terrible responsibility
that is yours stop and think of all-well
stop and think

  pencill stopped to think

  indeed tymes words reminded him
very much of one of his authors hamil
edmondton but in spite of himself pen-
cill was impressed with the great power
the great responsibility that was in his
finger slowly awedly he lowered his
arm now that tymes words had begun
to penetrate his consciousness he began
to realize the widespread cosmic destruc-
tion his folly would have caused really
his nature was such that he wouldnt pur-
posely harm a single hair on the head of
the lowest oog that crawled on the
farthest satellite of jupiter he shuddered
to think of what he had almost caused

  tyme sighed with relief too at the
narrow escape they had both had for
of course he wouldnt be born for some
 years yet and with all those suns
crashing about the earth would surely
have been destroyed and with the earth
gone he could never be born

  i almost forgot exclaimed tyme
then so anxious was i to save the uni-
verse from ruin by your thoughtless act
that i forgot that i have here the very
proof that i am from the twenty-third
century and not a lunatic as you seem to
persist in believing he then placed on
the editors desk the large bundle he had
brought with him

  just one moment mr pencill and i
will give you very definite proof that you
continued to live and edit future fiction

  swiftly tyme opened the bundle and
there on the desk pencill saw a huge stack
of yellowed magazines

there cried tyme triumphantly
there you see a stack of magazines that


wonder stories for august 

havent yet been printed-whose stories
havent yet been written-whose illus-
trations havent yet been drawn there
you see a stack of future fictions be-
tween the years of  and  surely
you will believe me now for you edited
those magazines see here is your name
on the first page

  pencill picked up one of the maga-
zines and gazed in stupefaction the date
on it said december  the pages
though yellowed and ragged at the edges
did not crumble at the touch as might
have been expected but were very limber
and pliable they had been thoroughly
coated with a very thin layer of some
transparent substance liquid cellophane
tyme said

  the stories in this issue were unknown
by pencill so he laid it down and picked
up one dated june  that would
be just one month later than the current
issue he remembered it looked not much
different from the issues of the past few
months he reflected he thumbed through
it greatly intrigued seeing there one or
two stories which only that morning he
had assigned to the next issue-which
hadnt yet gone to press but which he
now held in his hand

  then he came across something rather
strange halfway in the magazine be-
tween the end of one story and the be-
ginning of another was an insertion it
was a single page of smooth cardboard-
an announcement of some kind he had
never made announcements in that way
before pencill thought swiftly it must be
very important then the words jumped
out at him-gigantic words in letters two

and below in smaller type

  readers i attention we cannot find appro-
priate words nor enough words to tell you
of the tremendous experience that is about to
be yours for the past five years mr b lue
pencill editor-in-chief of future fiction has
held a secret which is probably not known to
a single science-fiction fan namely that a
very great man has long been a reader of future
fiction none other than professor john s mith

d	t head of the department of science at

the john bopkins university two years ago
acting under the continued urgency of mr
pencill professor mith agreed to write a story
for publication in this magazine that story
the core is now in the hands of editor
pencill and he wishes to say that never before
has he read anything like it to say that it is
great would be like calling the grand can-
yon cute it is bound to start a new era in
science-fiction writing the core will not
appear in the next issue or the next but in the
september issue we will present the first of four
instalments of the core during the inter-
vening two months we are going to launch a
vast advertising campaign every person who
ever read a piece of science-fiction in his life is
going to be informed of the coming of this
masterpiece what is the core

  what is its purpose but ah i you must wait
two more months and you will know all i

  when editor pencill had read this an-
nouncement his surprise was more than
somewhat he could not imagine himself
paying  for one story frantically
he looked through the pile of magazines
there-september  eagerly he
opened the pages and could hardly be-
lieve his eyes there was the first tre-
mendous instalment of the core by
professor john s mith d t then-
that meant that he had bought the story
 good heavens how could he have
been such a chump

	he glared wildly about the office and

  his eyes fell upon tyme standing non-
chalantly by but i wont have it pen-
cill exclaimed waving the magazine in the
air its-its preposterous i-i abso-
lutely refuse to buy the story the idea
no by gad i wont do it

  but mr pencill put in tyme mildly
dont you see that you must have pur-
chased the story i do not know which
story you mean but you must have pur-
chased it and printed it if you see it print-
ed there you cant reject it any more
than you could have shot yourself a while
ago otherwise tampering with the great
order of things think what might hap-
pen 

  pencill remembered what might hap-
pen and shuddered

  well it was-is-a tremendous story
i should like very much to print it but
the return of tyme



where did-will-i ever get the money
to buy it  i was-am-about bankrupt-

  tyme shrugged i know nothing about
that i would suggest mr pencill that
you just let matters take their course you
must have reached some sort of agreement
with the author of that story i would
also suggest that you keep these maga-
zines to guide you in your selection of
stories for future publication accept
only the stories you now see in these mag-
azines as they come in and reject all
the rest which of course must be as it
happened that way

  that is a great idea exclaimed pen-
cil as he visioned the great ease with
which he would be able to edit the maga-
zine in the future and i thank you
for allowing me to keep the magazines
and by the way mr tyme you didnt
say what was the reason for this visit
allow me to apologize now for the very
rude way i received you the last time
im afraid i was rather a fool

  thats quite all right the only rea-
son indeed for this return visit was to
convince you that i am indeed from the
twenty-third century and this i have done
by bringing these magazines back to you
besides i rather enjoy jumping from my
own century into the past it is indeed a
unique sensation both the de-materializ-
ing and the re-materializing i shall per-
haps visit you again mr pencill in the
near future and now that my purpose
has been accomplished if you will excuse
me i will be going

  as pencill looked on in interest tyme
stepped into the center of the room with
the utter unconcern of an experienced
time-traveler he pressed in quick succes-
sion a number of buttons on the flat box
at his waist pencill saw the air around
tymes body suddenly vibrate the body
grew dimmer seemed to expand then
with disconcerting suddenness it was not
there

  dazed as though just awakened from
a vivid dream the editor turned again
to the desk but it had not been a dream
there were the magazines pencill with
a sudden revival of interest began to ar-

range them in order from the most recent
date june  to the latest december
 the file was not complete he no-
ticed with a pang of regret nearly two
whole years were missing those of 
and  he wondered if the magazine
had been discontinued those two years
but thought it most likely that tyme
hadnt been able to secure them he hoped
tyme would bring those missing num-
bers next time he came-if he came at all

  his disappointment was short-lived
however as he began to look through the
future issues of future fiction at first
he noticed many familiar authors in the
rest of the  volumes were stories by
such established authors as vincent harll
hamil edmondton nach schatner r f
strazle richard tucker ray munn gal-
lon klar kashton smith lawrence ban-
ning the beloved doctor-author david k
eller and the mysterious enondapamis
e snoops b v d pencill observed these
names with pride they had been contrib-
uting to future fiction for a long time
then in the september issue was the first
instalment of that masterpiece the
core by professor john s mith d t
for four glorious issues it ran and from
the few letters pencill read in the
reader shrieks the readers seemed to be
overwhelmed by the power of it they
wondered why they hadnt been given this
kind of story before they demanded
more like it

  next pencill began to look through the

	and  volumes then it was that
he indeed began to realize the revolution-
ary effect the core had had-would
have-on science-fiction other authors
particularly the younger and newer ones
were quick to comprehend they realized
that stories like the core were going
to replace the old worn-out type of sci-
ence-fiction these younger writers were
quick to follow the example set for them
they had a fresher outlook newer ideas
set no limits for their imaginations

  one of them miller p schuyler was
the first to set the pace in this new era to
come in his story published early in 
he dealt with a theme of such cosmic

scope that heretofore it had gone un-
touched unattemptcd yet his originality
and freshness of style gave it the air of
utter simplicity it seemed to have been
given fully as much acclaim as had the
core

	tremendously interested pencill con-
  tinued to look through the  and

	volumes the established authors
were still represented but he was sur-
prised to see an increasing number of the
new-type stories by such of the coming au-
thors as miller p schuyler fran k elly
hilliard rowley benson hubert donold
w ollheim j harvard haggy festell
pragnus john harris benyon d cuth-
bert chester and others he saw stories
there too by authors who had heretofore
only written letters to his magazine-for-
rest jackerman jack d arrow and not a
few others b lue pencill was pleased in
fact he was delighted from all appear-
ances the core had indeed been as
successful as professor mith had said it
would be the slowly dying interest in his
magazine and in science-fiction had been
rekindled

  next he examined the magazines of
  and  and was amazed
at the change with increasing pleasure he
viewed the very excellent quality of the
magazines as a whole they were of large
size and printed on the very best stock of
smooth paper on the front cover were
the words

future fiction
the magazine devoted solely to literary sci-
ence-fiction b lue pencill phd sfnd
editor

  on the title-page he read  circulation
 and his heart thrilled the cover
picture was enclosed in a square perhaps
six by six inches which left a neat margin

around the edges and gave the magazine
a dignified appearance what it was sup-
posed to illustrate pencill could not tell
he had never before seen a science-fiction
illustration quite like it it was utterly
alien yet possessed of a definite aristo-
cratic beauty the artists name pencill
saw was wayne woodard there were
numerous inside illustrations too by this
same woodard pencill had never heard
of any artist by that name but he was cer-
tainly pleased at the evidence of his own
eyes 

  for the first time pencill suddenly was
aware that the room was growing dark
he looked at his watch and was sur-
prised to see that it was well past seven
oclock outside darkness was coming
fast for a moment pencill was at a loss
what to do with the magazines no one
must ever see them but himself then he
remembered the big iron safe in the cor-
ner the combination of which was known
to himself alone in a few minutes he
had it open and the magazines carefully
deposited therein

  pencill was very very pleased with
himself with the way he had-would-
bring the magazine out of the rut out of
its financial and literary difficulties with
the way he had-or would-develop the
magazine to its present-or rather future
-high standing future fiction-the
magazine devoted solely to literary

sfnd editor

  he was about to leave when he noticed
the automatic on the desk where he had
placed it unlocking the safe again he
placed the weapon in the farthermost cor-
ner and locked the heavy door upon it
then whistling with a cheerfulness he
felt for the first time in many months
he left the office he had decided to get
gloriously drunk

postscript to

 the return of tyme

by mchommed ulysses socrotes fips

head office boy wonder stories

	when this story was received the big chief
  walked into my private cubbyhole snorting

with wrath the big boss evidently was dis-
tressed he sometimes gets that way when one
of the stories gets a bit too personal with his
ego so the high potentate lets out a squawk
thuswise

  lookahere fips here is a damned good yarn
up to the last line hut that fool author goes
haywire and ends a good story in quicksand by
sending he editor out and having him get drunk

  that bellowed the sultan is what you call
a first-class hackneyed ending to a good story
now then fips my boy here is the story its up
to you to look it over and after you have thor-
oughly digested it you are supposed to get a
real o henry-like ending to the yarn so the
readers will like it

  saying this the grand vizier lit a fresh cigar
and stalked out of my office leaving me with
the manuscript

  i looked it over carefully and immediately i
was struck with the fact that i was at a great
disadvantage with the editor b luc pencill all
the editor-in-chief of future fiction had to do
was to look at the june  issue of future
fiction ami find the very ending he was looking
for inasmuch as i did not have the future is-
sues of wonder stories at hand i was handi-
capped and i had to call upon my own re-
sources anyhow i hope i have succeeded in
placating the wradi of the all highest so here
goes and i hope you like it

amended ending

	he was about to leave when he noticed the
  automatic on the desk where he had placed it

unlocking the safe again he placed the weapon
in the farthermost corner and locked the heavy
door upon it then whistling with a cheerful-
ness he felt for the first time in many months
he grabbed a telephone and by long distance
called up professor mith he informed that
worthy that he had great news for him and
that he should not fail to come to new york on
the morrow pencill then left the office and went
home for a much-needed sleep

  promptly at noon on the next day professor
john s mith dt of the john bopkins uni-
versity was again in pencill s office

  you will be surprised professor but extraor-
dinary things have happened since you left my
office yesterday you came within a fraction of
a second of upsetting our universe and maybe

a few extra island universes thrown in for good
measure the fact remains that jour stupendous
story the core actually has been published-
will be published-beginning with the septem-
ber  issne as a matter of fact so sure am
i of this that i will show you the story already
printed in the september october and novem-
ber  issues of future fiction

  so saying he carefully went to the safe which
lit unlocked and took out the future issues
which had as yet not been published and
dumped them on the desk before the astonished
professor mith who could hardly believe his
eyes

  he then went into details and told the more
and more astonished professor what had hap-
pened last night and how tyme had left the
future copies of the magazines with him

  but continued editor pencill while it is
a fact that your story the core is to be pub-
lished in the future as proven by these copies o
future fiction now before you there still re-
mains the little matter of compensation for the
story to you at c a word this amounts to
 as you no doubt realize this doesnt
worry me one iota because evidently it is all in
the cards that i bought the story and that i
paid for it

  but since it is your story perhaps you will be
good enough to tell me how i am to pay you
for it-a mere detail which no doubt you will
easily iron out yourself you being the author
of this super-science-fiction story should have
little trouble in telling me how the payment is
to be made

  the professor did not reply at once instead
he looked through all the future issues from
 up into  making notes all the while of
the names of the stories their authors and other
data

	pencill sat interestedly while he smoked a
pipe he did not seem to have a care in the
world indeed he looked much younger be-
cause the future not only seemed-no-the fu-
ture was rosy

  in a short time the professor had finished
and delivered himself of the following in his
best classroom manner

  the solution my dear pencill is exceedingly
simple-nothing to it at all i notice that all the
wrtiers who have been the backbone of your
future fiction magazine right along are well
represented in the future issues too there are
all told some four hundred odd stories by your


wonder stories for august 

old writers in the coming issues of future fic-
tion

  we will leave out the new authors from
whom you have as yet not heard and whom
as yet you do not know because they have not
made themselves known to you so far but
here we have  stories to be published well into
 by your old authors each one of these
stories according to your usual rate of pay-
ment figures at an average of just about 
this makes a total of  which you will
have to pay these authors between now and
 now every author knows how difficult it
is to write new stories it is lime-consuming
he must think up his plot and there is a lot of
trouble to it as i know myself having worked
a year and a half on my own story the core

  suppose you were to tell all of your authors
that you already have all of their stories and
that between now and  it wont be neces-
sary fr them to write these particular stories a
list of which you will be glad to furnish each
author as a matter of fact you can furnish
each author with a copy of his story which you
already have here on the table the author im-
mediately will recognize his own story and can
spend his time writing different stories which
he can sell either to you or some other magazine

  suppose now that you offer each author
 for his story instead of  upon publica-
tion he should be glad to take it because he
does not have to work on the story except that
when the proper time comes in the future he
will typewrite it but he will be much assisted
by seeing his printed story before he ever writes
it but typewrite it he must of course other-
wise this entire time business would be silly
he will even save the postage to send the story
to you because you can tell him in advance he
need not send the story into your office at all

the postage is quite a bit of an item with most
authors as they will be glad to tell you

  in other words you are offering the author
 for a story which you already have and
which he wont have to write at all except that
he has to typewrite it at the proper time in the
future

  that makes a net profit of  to you
you pay the authors  instead of 
for the  stories

  now then here is where i come in for
supplying you with the idea of financing the
deal instead of paying me  you pay me
 now hold on and dont go up in the
air

  this remark was made because pencill had
jumped up in his chair and had become deathly
pale

  to continue said the professor i appre-
ciate the fact that i wont get my money at once
you make a profit of  from wliich we
deduct  for my story which still leaves
you a net profit of  i will take my money
in instalments between now and  you to
pay me at the end of seven years  in other
words  every year at the end of the
seven years you owe me nothing and you
have made a profit of  net

  you can even do better you can go to your
bank and show them the future copies of future
fiction which tyme has left with you tell
them the whole story and tell them about the
deal where you will make  net profit 
miss my guess if the bank doesnt give you
an advance of  on your personal note im-
mediately what do you say

  pencill was too much overcome to say a
word all he could do was to shake the hand of
professor mith and then he whispered in his
ear

  both had decided to get gloriously drunktt

	there was a dull rumbling in the air
and unsteady footing as the floor
lurched heavily from side to side a
swarming mass of humanity pushed by
in a frenzy of speed lewis barden looked
up from his magazine he knew the sub-
way well he spent three hours a day in
its nerve-wracking journeying this was
just another day he would go to the
office and work so hard that home for
him was just a place to sleep he did not
even know most of the occupants of his
boarding house here he was twenty-
seven years old already and all that life
held for him was a dingy little section of
a large office with subway rides and sleep
in between he longed to live a life of
excitement like the hero in the story he
was reading science-fiction was his only
escape from the dull routine with it he
tried to drown his own life in that of the
hero of the story a genuine interest in
science had been developed by his favor-
ite magazine after a not-too-studious
college career

  soon he was immersed in the final
pages of the tale as he reached the con-
clusion he said to himself golly why
cant something like that happen to me
he looked across to the opposite seat
full of people with gum-chewing jaws
and vacant staring faces

  they seem to be satisfied with life
but i am glad that i am different he
philosophized there is not an atom of
adventure or ambition in the whole car
oh for the days of the past or the
future the present is too monotonous
he looked out of the window at the
next station and discovered that there
were yet six stops to go so he picked
up one of the many discarded newspapers
to glance through it was opened to the

want ads so he read these first one in
particular drew his attention because of
its unusual tone

 wanted adventuresome young
man to participate in a danger-
ous scientific enterprise no pay
can be offered much risk in-
volved only those interested
purely in the venture need ap-
ply for further information
come wednesday evening at
seven-thirty to  west th
street ask for dr austin

  im your man shouted lew as he
rushed from the car at his stop this was
wednesday and he had already planned
to answer the advertisement in person
three of the gum-chewing jaws actually
missed a stroke at the disturbance of the
owners semi-conscious state as lew hur-
ried away   

  if his work had seemed long other
days it now seemed as though minutes
had changed to light years if that were
possible lew was not exactly sure what
a light year was but thought it suited his
situation however all days have come
to an end so far and this one was no
exception lew was the first one out of
the office supper was hurriedly finished
then he entered the subway for his new
destination finally it was seven-thirty
and lew was ready to ascend the stoop
of an ordinary five-story building the
first floor was a paint store but above it
seemed to be a cheap grade of apartment
building

  many ideas sped through lews mind
as he mounted the steps what great ad-
venture was in store for him  perhaps
he would have to give up his position
he had saved enough to last him about
a year and he would do almost anything
for a change the office was getting un-
bearable visions of journeys in strange
lands or possibly on other planets assailed

him as he rang the one doorbell in evi-
dence almost before his hand was off
the button the door opened a crack and
a feminine voice spoke to him in a
whisper

  dont come in if you value your life
heed this warning and go home in
safety

  needless to say lew was startled
this was the last thing he had expected
the warning promised more danger than
he had bargained for pie quickly put his
foot in the opening and forced the door
open a pretty dark-haired girl of about
twenty was standing there in the dim
light there was a sadness about her
eyes that told of a not-too-easy life

  please she begged dont come in
go home while you may

  no replied lew i came in answer
to the advertisement to see dr austin
and i dont intend to leave until i have
seen him is this the right place who
are you

  i am lillian austin dr austin is my
father he put the advertisement in the
paper

  then why are you so afraid some-
thing will happen to me are you afraid
of your father tell me about it coaxed
lew

  shhhhh whispered lillian not so
loud my father might hear you i dont
know what has come over him recently
he seems to have been affected mentally
i am so worried

  yes asked lew becoming more
interested

  he has been working on a new in-
vention that has used up almost all of
our money he thinks it is all finished
but i am not so sure dad has been acting
so strangely lately that i would hardly
know him now please take my word
for it and go home

  not on your life answered lew
quickly i am not going to leave any-
thing that promises to be exciting the
advertisement promised thrills and i am
going to get them if your father is men-
tally deranged you should not be left

alone with him will you take me to
him

  all right was the dubious reply but
dont say i didnt warn you

  ok i hereby relieve you of all re-
sponsibility for the person of lewis
barden he grinned

  she took him up one flight of stairs
and then led him toward the rear of
the building

  this is dads laboratory where he
spends most of his time nowadays she
opened the door to a large well-lighted
room the only items it contained were
two hard chairs and an apparatus of
some sort over which an elderly man was
working he started suddenly and cov-
ered the equipment with a black cloth

  you should have knocked dear he
said who is this gentleman 

  this is mr barden who has come in
answer to your advertisement this morn-
ing he wishes to talk to you about it

  ah yes yes indeed said dr aus-
tin kindly wont you be seated mr
barden i am sorry the furnishings are
not more complete but my invention
should remedy that as soon as the world
knows about it  shall call you when i
need you dear this last to his daugh-
ter

  good evening mr barden dont for-
get what i told you were miss austins
parting words as she left the room

  lew turned to dr austin surely this
man could not be mentally affected his
whole manner was so charming and
kindly his grey hair added a touch ot
dignity to his tearing however lew de-
cided he would watch his step dr aus-
tins next words astonished him more
than ever

  you must not mind my daughter it
has been one of the greatest worries of
my life she has what you might call hal-
lucinations generally she is perfectly
sane and normal but every once in a
while she develops a great fear without
logical reason i am telling you this in
case she has a chance to talk to you
alone i do not want you to misunder-
stand
the sense twister



  that is a shame said lew you cer-
tainly would not think there was anything
at all wrong with her however ill try
to understand if she acts queerly

  so that explains it thought lew or
does it which one is crazy or are they
both a little off this is certainly inter-
esting i am inclined to believe the doc-
tor these thoughts left him in a quan-
dary so he decided to continue the con-
versation

  do you mind if we get down to the
point  i am interested in what your prop-
osition concerns will you please tell me
more about it

  briefly this is it began dr austin
i think i have discovered a liquid which
when injected into the blood stream will
in a few minutes render all the body
nerves very suscepiible to ultra-violet
rays and x-rays the sensations then re-
ceived by the nerves may be controlled by
these rays a beam of x-rays concen-
trated on a certain nerve will reverse the
sensations received by this nerve the
ultra-violet beam will return it to normal
a combination of both rays will ren-
der the nerve senseless

  i am afraid this is getting beyond
me ventured lew

  perhaps i can make it clearer by
means of an illustration answered the
doctor suppose i were to give you an
injection and then subject your thumb to
the x-ray in two or three minutes the
messages sent to your brain by the nerves
would be the exact opposites of the facts
of the case heat would give a sensation
of cold and vicc versa pressure on your
thumb would feel like suction do you
follow me

  yes i think i am beginning to under-
stand now the ultra-violet ray would
change the nerves back to normal  would
you have to use a new injection for
that

  yes the effect of the liquid on the
nerves soon wears off but the sensations
remain reversed until the same process
is repeated with the ultra-violet ray thus
bringing them back to normal a combina-

tion of the two rays will deaden the nerve
for as long as it is subjected to them

	while lew was listening to this dis-
course he had an uncomfortable feel-
ing of someone watching him he turned
around and looked in back of him but
nothing suspicious was in evidence he
finally decided that his own nerves were
not in very good shape he tried to shake
off his uneasiness by returning his atten-
tion to the doctor

  what are the practical uses of such
equipment queried lew

  why there are hundreds of uses
returned the doctor suppose someone
were to injure his leg badly the surgeon
would deaden the nerves while operating
thereby proving its value as an anaesthetic
afterward while recovering the sensa-
tions would be changed by the x-ray so
that the pain would become pleasure in
that way some of the most crippled
people in the world would be made the
happiest of course the apparatus will
have to be used wisely to prevent misuse
but that is true of almost anything on
earth now that i have outlined one ex-
ample cannot you see the tremendous
importance of such an invention

  i surely do agreed lew it would
certainly be a blessing to the world but
what part am i supposed to play in it
why did you advertise for me

  lew was still conscious of that feeling
of prying eyes could it be that something
else was happening in the house some-
thing of which he had no knowledge
it was sinister he again shook off his
fears and listened to dr austin

  the whole trouble with my equipment
is that i have not tested it on a human
being as yet i have tried it on animals
but they cannot report their feelings to
me how can i tell whether the animal
feels cold or hot when i hold ice against
it this major difficulty is to be over-
come when i try it on a human being
however that person for whom i adver-
tised will have to be willing to take a cer-
tain risk it may affect the mind irrep-

arably this would not be noticed in the
animals  experimented on unless it were
very definite insanity lesser mental cases
cannot be easily detected in animals my
daughter offered to be the subject but
naturally any father dislikes the idea of
using his own daughter as a subject for
experimentation also her hallucinations
would probably make her reports un-
reliable  therefore i advertised as i did
i have nothing to offer you my last
penny has gone into my equipment you
have a fifty-fifty chance of coming
through all right are you willing this
is your last opportunity to refuse as i
intend to begin tonight if possible

  this was just what lew had been look-
ing for a new kind of experience but
now that it had presented itself he was
not so sure of himself he thought over
the matter carefully who was crazy the
daughter or the doctor or both he
rather trusted dr austin but then the
daughter was in deadly earnest too what
if she were right did she know some-
thing about the rays that her father did
not know hardly probable and what
about this constant sensation of prying
eyes suddenly lew decided in spite
of the price he might have to pay he
would go through with it he answered
the doctors query

  i am ready to take the chance for
science

  good said the doctor i shall pre-
pare for the experiment

  he went over and pulled the cover off
the apparatus lew recognized it as
x-rar and ultra-violet equipment of the
very best type underneath was assort of
long couch the doctor had his back to-
ward lew when a small sheet of paper
was thrust quickly into his hand he
turned just in time to see the retreating
form of lillian austin close the door
lew glanced down and unfolded the
paper it was hastily written and difficult
to read

 this is your very last
chance for life follow me
quickly i can save you

  now that i am in it ill stay in
thought lew her hallucinations are
working overtime tonight

  the doctor was speaking as he worked
this room is covered completely with
a heavy layer of lead extra x-ray and
ultra-violet rays would filter in and ruin
the use of the injection especially during
the day if i had not taken that precau-
tion and now my dear mr barden if
you will be so kind as to step this way
just like a movie usher thought lew
he stood up and walked over to the
apparatus

  which part of my anatomy shall we
use for the test how about my tongue
it would be a change to taste sour sugar
and sweet lemons i wouldnt have to
worry about biting my tongue would i
it would be most enjoyable i would have
to be careful about whom i kissed
though  might not be able to stand the
agony

  i am glad you are in such good spirits
my boy nodded dr austin please
recline on this couch i think you will find
it quite comfortable one finger will be
sufficient for a preliminary test i think
are you ready 

  ok answered lew weakly he
wasnt quite so sure that he was enjoy-
ing himself as much as he had expected

	dr austin took a hypodermic from a
container and held it poised over
lews arm he brought it down slowly
and carefully pushed the plunger all the
way in lew waited tensely for the
result

  rest a few minutes for it to take
effect prescribed the doctor kindly
then i shall start the x-ray treatment
be sure to notice the results carefully it
all depends on you it is still not too late
to change your mind if you wish

  no sir ill go through with it said
lew determinedly

  the doctor started the x-ray machine
and gradually brought it to bear on lews
finger one more moment and lew would
be experiencing something that no human
the sense twister



being had ever known that is if it
worked how would this test affect his
later life it was about time for him to
notice a change

  that is enough doctor you win the
bet came a voice from the hall followed
by a tall handsome dark-complexioned
young man

  lew sat up in surprise at this intrusion

  i knew i would win answered the
doctor

  may i ask what this is all about
asked lew now on his feet

  i bet the doctor that no one would be
fool enough to answer an advertisement
in which it was definitely stated that
there would be no recompense and plenty
of risk as you see i lost replied the
stranger

  tom has worded it rather badly but
that is the truth continued dr austin
we had an argument in which tom
said that no one would be willing to be
the subject in a dangerous scientific ex-
periment without a lot of pay i think
you are an exceedingly venturesome
young man i like you for it the world
needs more people like you

  lew was a long time finding something
to say this was all quite a bombshell
and it had succeeded in scattering his
wits finally he was able to master him-
self enough to say well ill be-

  he checked himself just in time as
lillian entered well anyway she was
not crazy neither was dr austin he

lew was the only crazy one to be made
a joke of was no fun especially after
all he had gone through he picked up
his hat

  how about the injection he asked

  salt water was the answer

  well said lew you have won your
bet now may i go i must say i do
not appreciate the joke

  i won five hundred dollars ventured
the doctor and i would be willing to
share it-

  dont bother said lew abruptly he
turned toward lillian she seemed to be
sorry for him she would be good com-
pany and he knew so few people in the
city perhaps she would consider going
out with him some time it would do no
harm to ask her

  this is tom brooks my fiance in-
troduced lillian he was watching from
the next room we are to be married
tomorrow

 from the doorway lew said an
abrupt congratulations

	 

  the rumble of the subway the next
morning accompanied lew back to work

  good old science-fiction thought
lew as he took the magazine out of his
pocket it is more realistic than life itself
and far less disappointing

  he unwrapped a stick of chewing gum
and slowly put it into his mouth a new
jaw had been added to the chewing gum
brigade

the end

completely empty space unlikely scientist finds

  ap new evidence that there is no
such thing as completely empty space in
the universe even in the cold dark
reaches between the stars was announced
today by the carnegie institution of
washington

  latest studies of interstellar space
made at the carnegie institutions mount
wilson calif observatory show that
even in the remotest regions of space a
few scattered atoms of matter always
exist

  a space ship zooming over the forty

million million miles that separate any
two average stars would never travel in
a complete vacuum it would have to push
through a tenuous barrier of about one
atom in every cubic inch this would not
slow down the space ship much however
for it is estimated that  atoms
could bo laid side by side in one inch of
space

  interstellar space is an excellent but
not a perfect vacuum said dr p w
merrill of the mount wilson staff re-
porting his findings

the men from gayln

by e mantell

	out of the nightmare unrealities of the

  late war a million men brought home
the story of a weird visitation the tale
never received official notice the worlds
newspapers of the time in the flooding
tide of vital news and still more vital
casualties never found time to mention a
fantastic fleeting occurrence and the
very men who saw it for the instant it
was there merely shook their heads for a
bewildered moment blinked their eyes
dazedly and were each secretly relieved
to find that they had banished the mirage
only afterward on chance comparison of
notes was it discovered that the vision
had been more than shaken fancy

  it was one of those red nights of hell
the world shook and throbbed and
jumped under the hammering of a mil-
lion guns the enormous blackness
danced in a million pin-pricks of flame
and a red haze swirled madly in the eery
light of intermittent flares

  at one instant the landscape weaved
and bobbed and in the next the strange
thing happened out in the center of the
inferno in the very middle of whistling
wailing shrieking thumping crossfire it
suddenly materialized-a huge ova of
livid violet light wide and high it stood
blotting out earth and sky for an eter-
nity of an instant it lived and shimmered
blindingly for that instant its glowing
wall of flame rippled unbrokenly under
the chance bombardment of missiles and
then in a slight slackening of the tumult
as suddenly and as definitely as it had
come it vanished

  there the matter stood a forgotten or
only casually mentioned event in the lives
of the beholders until the coming of the
time-raiders out of dim posterity

  	ah time-trarel fans should enjoy this

      tale tirae-travel is said to be the moat
   impossible theme in science-fiction and
   while this may be so such stories cannot
   be called scientifically incorrect for time-
   travel is so far bejond modern scientific
   experiment that one mans guess is as
   good as anothers a theory is not impos-
   sible until it is proven so and the proof
   must be practical aad not a counter-
   theory

     in this story we are introduced to men
   from the so distant future that many
   civilizations have flourished and died
   many greater than ours between our age
   and theirs but the men from gayln do
   not come in peace-all except one

  they came on the th day of decem-
ber  as suddenly as they had ap-
peared on that night thirty years before
this time they materialized by daylight
on a snowy scape of indiana in the amer-
icas and this time they lingered

  the nearby city of seton poured forth
its thousands for a view of the miracle a
huge glowing ball of fire overshadowing
in awestruck minds the towering piles of
chicagos new farragut building

  by the living lights burst out a late
arrival thats what i saw in france i
knew it if joe were here hed believe me
now

  curious people drew near and the new-
comer waxed voluble the first clue
passed out through the mob and to the
world like wildfire

  the world-wide news services went
into action in seconds word flashed
around the globe that a strange new intel-
ligent entity had arrived interest ran
high hourly bulletins were issued the
roads the railroads hie air-lanes were
suddenly crowded converging on that
spot in indiana bringing new hordes of
the curious very early the state militia

was called out to handle the swelling
crowds

  wild theories flew still more wildly

  mars venus jupiter figured on every-
bodys tongue with mars predominating
learned men appealed to advanced ir-
relevant propositions and equivocated
wisely no one could possibly have
guessed at the truth

  and then finally one of the bulletins
carried real news the veil of fire was
thinning a gleaming metal showed
vaguely through the aura men there
were undoubtedly men or beings of some
kind in the interior of that oval

  a little later came the word gold
the monster ship was made of gold

  in the terrific suspense of the ensuing
hours the waiting world was at the edge
of hysteria

  in the meanwhile the governments of
the world were not idle the private
cables were hot with orders advice and
admonitions to emissaries old rivalries
had a new melon of untold magnitude
over which to wrangle and at the proper
time the proper amount of restraint must
be flung to the winds to assure ones
country the proper degree of supremacy

  official representatives of the nations
waited on the president of the united
states to offer their felicitations on the
happy advent and to warn him helpfully
-or was it hopefully- to be prepared
for untoward eventualities

  queer lot of green-eyed beggars he
admitted to his secretary with a grim
smile

  the beloved fighting president-first
ever to succeed himself three consecutive
times in the white house-had already
made provisions for those untoward
eventualities air fleets and land fleets
had received their mobilization and route
orders the visitors would be saluted and
welcomed royally - according to their
mood

 	the first man to emerge from the gold

 ship was a profound disappointment to
 the vast multitude a tall thin ordinary

looking man with a thick crop of black
hair in color be was dark almost red
but no darker than some of the million
peering faces onlv his garb aroused a
new hope in his beholders black elastic
and skin-tight it limned every curve of
his stringy muscular body

  he leapt to the ground looked about
calmly at the tight-packed deathly quiet
assemblage and raised a hand in friendly
greeting turning back he called in
through the circular door

  and then the massed hordes burst forth
in a titanic sigh of gratification

  ahjili it rolled and reverberated

  for here was something

  perliaps a dozen men - indubitably
men-leapt one by oie from the craft
tall nearly seven feet they were heav-
ily and lithely muscled white teeth
gleamed out of dark red faces as they
smiled over the masses and the great
shaggy heads of brown or black hair
bobbed up and down as they nodded
around the circle these could be men of
venus or mars everybody decided

  airplanes wheeled overhead as in the
little cleared area earths official repre-
sentatives stepped forward in welcome
amenities of a sort passed relayed by the
omnipresent broadcasters to the waiting
ears of the world the strangers twitched
warily uneasily under the incessant blink-
ing of the photographers flashes and
their fingers ever and again unconsciously
sought the knob-like projections at their
waists

  a million people in a suffocating mob
that spread out over the plains as far as
the eye could see oblivious to biting cold
and trampled snow surged involuntarily
heavily vainly at thick wire strands and
let out a great terrifying roar of elation
and triumph

  new times were coming to the earth

  new contact with outer space was es-
tablished

  undreamt-of possibilities were before
mankind

  the millennium had arrived

chapter ii
men from the future

 that first conclave - the strangest

  meeting in all history-ended on a dis-
cordant note affairs fortunately for un-
told lives never reached the point of
open hostilities but among the thousand
revelations one downright statement
stunned and alarmed the world left it
groping and gasping in uncertainty

  the greetings were commonplace
enough

  welcome tc earth said professor
harrell

  with an eery shock the tense waiting
millions all over the globe heard one of
the little figures on their telescreens reply
in english

  greetings

  you speak english came from the
professor in surprise

   yes the tall thin man of the strang-
ers was the spokesman

   formally with the smooth polish of the
diplomat professor harrell ignored the
abnormality the entirely unprecedented
nature of the meeting he presented his
companions giving to each of them his
title his status his origin an imposing
array of the worlds foremost statesmen
scientists and soldiers

  i am mithrad said the stranger in
his turn these my masters do not
speak your tongue we are from gayln
of the eastern hemisphere we have
come back to you on a mission which
concerns the future existence of man

  you have come back questioned
professor harrell newspaper stories of
the globes previous appearance had pre-
pared him for that you have been here
before 

  no replied the other we have
come back through the ages

  oh the profesor dropped the point
it promised to be an involved explana-
tion and he knew what impatient audi-
tors were at his back where is gayln 

  in the eastern hemisphere of the
planet

   which planet if you please 

  earth replied the other a little
peeved

  the professor was amazed

  mithrad went on in a stilted english
he related that his masters came out of a
dim posterity a thousand ages and each
age would consist of ten or twenty thou-
sand of your earth-years

  their scientists he continued had long
been masters of time transposition in the
later ages it was in universal use and all
history was an open book fur the first
time now an age as remote as this was
being visited these travelers were in fact
pioneers of a sort and the trip had been
fraught with a degree of danger but they
had come out of sheer necessity

  this age which they now visited had
never been singularly noted for outstand-
ing achievement it had risen flourished
for its little time even less than the nor-
mal span and then had completely van-
ished

  a few moments ago when they had
come to rest in the midst of a titan up-
heaval of men against men they had
thought they were viewing the death
throes of a lost civilization for them-
selves they had seemed a fortuitous cir-
cumstance and they had reversed the
course of their journey to succor some of
the survivors

  as his soft penetrating voice went on
much of what he said was obscure to his
auditors but ever and again there ap-
peared a reference to a mission a need
a message sometimes the speaker would
halt to gather his thoughts sometimes he
stopped to choose a word sometimes to
listen respectfully to some interpolation
from one of his companions delivered in
a liquid slithering flow of unknown con-
sonants

  late afternoon shadows were thicken-
ing and the exodus of cold and hungry
people was gathering momentum when
mithrad came finally to the core of his
message

  his companions toward the end had
been growing impatient fidgety and more
and more they prodded him in that jum-
bled streaming flow of indescribable lan-


wonder stories for august 

guage more and more mithrad hastened
his words and a strained look settled on
his face the worlds statesmen despite
their breathless interest and the growing
premonition that vague hints had been
rousing in them had been shifting in fa-
tigue from foot to foot and had been at-
tempting from time to time to suggest a
graceful adjournment-longingly-to the
ships interior or failing that to one of
the spacious consulates

  then mithrad came to the point

  our women he said have chosen to
retire to chrszn a mountain country of
the west imitating the ladies of the later
urjtrin era they have renounced all affil-
iation with men and seek to establish an
empire of their own while certainly their
course promises the end of maledom it
might also obviously mean the end of all
mankind it was this factor which defeat-
ed that earlier rebellion of the women of
urjtrin

  but there is speech now of a new
chemical vario-vibration which will for-
ever banish the need of men on earth
now they kill men at sight in chrszn and
through psychological pre-determination
none of course are born

  we have come for women we come
peaceably we know you have not yet
passed the infantile family stage of your
race as such our offer will come to you
as a revolutionary shock but our time
is limited we cannot seek further
through the ages for a collective bargain-
ing era we make our offer to you for
each maid we will give to your govern-
ments or to your peoples her weight in
any precious metal you will name we beg
you to consider this offer seriously

	one of the strangers behind him inter-
rupted him harshly a caustic threat-
ening flow made mithrad flinch and he
turned to continue doggedly

  my master wishes me to warn you
that we are prepared to defend ourselves
against any attack and that we are pre-
pared to replace our peaceable requests

   as close an approximation of the gaylcne word as

may be contrived

by irresistible demands we are deter-
mined for the future of our own race
and time to have what we came for

  for a moment after that downright
statement earths representatives and the
massed hordes over the plain were taken
aback the deathly silence grew intense
as shocked wits and pent-up emotions col-
lected themselves for a great outburst
the strangers seemed to sense the great
upwelling of antagonism that had sprung
into being their fingers flew to their
black-clad waists and unknown danger
hovered in the dusk

  mithrad stepped into the breach de-
spite the cold moisture dotted his brow
as he addressed his companions we of
earth knew not what risk he ran thus to
interpose but in the trembling of his
limbs and in the glaze of his eye he be-
trayed an awareness of his fate

  his voice abased beyond recognition
addressed his masters for only a mo-
ment they let him speak one of them
cut in cruelly definitely even as the
others turned to clamber into the ship
one by one the dark figure extended its
arm in the dusk and pointed a finger at
mithrads head those nearby saw a flash
of blue light leap from that extended fin-
ger mithrad suddenly silently slumped
to the ground in a motionless heap

  the stranger turned grasped an ex-
tended hand and leapt through the open-
ing

  the round gold door swung slowly to
and moved into place

chapter iii
the foray

	it is needless to review the storm of

  protest and the wave of unanimity that
swept over the civilized world never be-
fore had there been this need for con-
certed action against a common foe this
joint cause that wiped out boundaries na
tionalisms and old differences the na-
tions by popular acclaim threw their re-
sources open to the worlds defense in a
manner that warmed the hearts of the
universalists the men mobilized eagerly
 he men from gayln



and sent mass telegrams to geneva assert-
ing specious claims to seniority

  and the women-inexplicably-were
circumspect their militant organizations
passed resolutions advising caution they
advised temporizing with the strangers
they voiced grave fears of the unknown
powers of the time-raiders and there
was even some talk of organizing volun-
teers for the greatest adventure in the
history of mankind conquest of a new
age by the women of  but that idea
was nipped in the bud early-and by the
best of authorities

  mithrad lived ambulances all too
readily requisitioned that day were on
the spot great names in medicine gath-
ering toward quite another end were
available and mithrad after all was
found to be the victim of ordinary elec-
trolysis strychnine and oxygen were the
means of resuscitating the man who
turned out to be the saver of the world

  the choice before the president of the
united states was a difficult one not
lightly was war to be undertaken against
strangers with unknown weapons and
heaven alone knew what weird powers
that bomb and shell would have no effect
against their flaming protective veil he
had the evidence of a million witnesses
and in the face of their very apparent
new knowledge it seemed foolhardy to
pit the puny science of his world if the
only alternative meant surrender then
would the fighting president live up to
his name in the meantime he gathered
up his powers assembled his brain
trust and posted a close watch on the
ship and when word came to him that
mithrad would live he postponed formu-
lating a definite plan of attack

  gradually the ship of the raiders
waxed hot and incandescent giving rise
to the short-lived hope that they were
about to depart but the huge ball of liv-
ing flame stayed on and made day out of
night for the distant ring of sentries and
troops

  two days later the men from gayln
of the eastern hemisphere made a sortie

and brought the nglit to earth-a short
hopeless one-sided holocaust that struck
despair to the heart of america the
globe of fire abated its intensity not a jot
and yet through the flame the distant
sentinels saw the familiar forms emerge
somehow different in appearance
through hastily focused field-glasses
they found that the figures were black
from crown to toe some sort of black
hood drawn over their heads completed
what was obviously a protective dress
and a closer scrutiny revealed something
else each man as he came glowed with a
violet aura of his own it was uncanny to
see those black shining forms each close-
ly flatne-ringed suddenly appear through
the wall of fire land lightly on the ground
and step out over the plain away from
the blinding background

  and still they came a dozen two
dozen fifty a hundred out over the
plain they spread to some preconcerted
plan and they began their advance

  the field radios took up the story of
the advance back to headquarters
flashed the word that the war was on out
of headquarters to a hundred points went
the orders that woke to life concentrated
forces of earth the tanks lumbered into
motion the distant hum of aircraft beat
up the sky the gas squads and the fire
squads turned grimly to their mortars
and bombs and tanks

  for a few minutes of deathly quiet
while the myriad forces of america con-
verged on the hundred solitary figures on
the plain it looked like a massacre of the
innocents no earthly agency could with-
stand the hell about to unloose

	but the strangers were more than

   earthly literally they waded through a
rain of shot and shell smoke and gas and
liquid fire low flying bombers dropped
torpedoes that shattered the ground un-
der their feet heaving tanks opened an
approaching fire that was a solid wall of
flying metal the machine guns laid down
a staccato lawn-mower of steel-jackets

  and in a sickening horror america
saw the invaders continue their unscathed


wonder stories for august 

advance bullets missiles fragments all
simply vanished into nothingness on con-
tact with a thin veneer of violet over a
flimsy shroud of black

  then retaliation t h e lightnings
flashed here there through the murky
pall extended arms and fingers pointed
jagged blue streaks darted tanks ran
into electrical discharges that danced
sang played over them - and blasted
them men crouching and feeding their
guns were suddenly caught up in a con-
vulsive devastating blue flash that
scorched twisted and leapt fliers
dropped wingless and flaming to explode
in a crescendo that punctuated the din

  two regiments nineteen tank corps
forty air squadrons were wiped out that
day

  in half an hour americas first line of
defense had disappeared

  now other points in the flaming gold
ship destroyed new scores of black beings
distant observers saw the swelling flut-
tering hordes grow into thousands-thou-
sands that covered the ground and filled
the air around the ship like bees cluster-
ing about the hive then in a long thin
liquid stream haloed in celestial seeming
they branched away through the air sup-
ported and propelled by some invisible
means toward the city of seton

  a thousand tales are told of vain val-
iant sacrifices that day in the last of all
mans strongholds his home the streets
under the invading flight were raked by
the lightnings men desperately hope-
lessly resisting to the last were casually
stricken motionless through some whim
the bolts they loosed in the city were
finely gauged to disable temporarily
their victims rose later physically un-
harmed  else the list of casualties would
have been beyond computing

  out over the city like a blight spread
the swarm locks doors walls vanished
before their magic touch

  women young women comely women
were scooped from the streets from their
offices their homes-all in merciful un-
consciousness

  and leaving behind them a ravished si-

lent desolated city they filled the heavens
in flight toward their ship carrying in
their arms the burden of their first suc-
cessful foray

chapter iv
mithrad the savior

	america turned to mithrad as its last

  hope

  troops and anns were rushing to in-
diana from all corners of the country
europe and asia were embarking their
men with a fine abandon of home defense
the sooner to put within reach that most
available most useless of resources man-
power and the high commands were
scouring the wide world and its brains for
-an idea -

  all was in vain how suddenly to
fathom the scientific mysteries of the bot-
tomless future

  and the world came to the bedside of
mithrad

  the man had survived he would live

  from time to time he had opened his
eyes wearily he had looked about he
would thankfully accept a little fluid and
then drift off again to the sleep of the
weak

  there was nothing to do but grit ones
teeth clench ones fist over wet palms
and wait and pray

  scientists found his body interesting
enough under the black garment there
had been none of the projections noticed
on his companions but there was much
else early listening stethoscopically to
the heart-beat even when the man must
have been well-nigh dead they had been
overwhelmed by the strength and complex
confusion of the sound the clamor had
been beyond anything they had known
examination had disclosed the presence
of two separate heart systems each acting
apparently independently there had been
definite lack of a pulse anywhere in the
body blood seemed to flow in a single un-
valved stream directly from the hearts in
the mans head teeth had lost their indi-
vidual structure solid ivory sharp hard
enameled grooved and ridged extended

through the gums from the skull proper
this race knew no dentists and the man
had no toes his feet ended in a round
jointed club-effect that was strange and
revolting to view the skeletal foot how-
ever with the dropping of a minor joint
was similar to our own

  in the elated fervor of their discov-
eries the scientists almost forgot the
waiting crying world they were rudely
recalled by the horrors of seton

  the mans first words were in the
tongue of the strangers addressed in
english comprehension dawned slowly
and then as reality struck at him he
would have sprung erect if he could

  anxious questions were on his lips
closely watched over by his physicians he
heard a rapid recital of recent events and
a new wonderful calm that communicated
itself to those about him settled over him
as he sank into deep thought

  the others could only gaze at him with
a prayer in their hearts

  my life in gay in he said at last in a
tone of incredible relief is over it was
not much  death might have been
better  if that were an escape but
they would have followed me there to tor-
ture me

  here is freedom a new world more
than i could possibly have hoped for i
cannot understand how skryk failed to
kill me

  if only my fellows were here with
me

  who are you he was asked and
vour fellows

  we are a captive race from etryd
taken for our accomplishment in the sci-
ences for four centuries we have turned
the noblest powers of nature to the use of
the beasts of gayln now perhaps    

  how did they come to leave you
here 

  that was an error said mithrad
grimly a little twist of the knob they
should have made doubly sure

 	new strength seemed to have come to

 him like the release of which he spoke
 fire was suddenly in his voice as he com-

menced making inquiries and requests
he commanded the presence of physicists
chemists geologists - and the greatest
were near

  to his hearers relief came in a great
wave of anticlimax that made them want
to laugh and shout-and made them gig-
gle when the great men of the world came
trouping into that white hospital room
like schoolboys appearing before the mas-
ter

  probingly with a superior penetration
and brain-power he reached out to the
farthest limits of the earths physical
knowledge and resources often he had
to convey his point in the most round-
about descriptions there were no words
in the language he apologized for some
of the things he must have much he had
to pass by in the urgency of the moment
often he had had to stop to discard a line
of investigation to cast about for some-
thing else but slowly here a hint there
a discovery a plan a campaign grew
into the vaguest outline of being

  and as the buzz of orders went out
from that room when the president gave
the saver carte blanche when the news-
papers leapt at the story somewhat
sketchily elaborated of a world rescued
and of a thousand and one new scientific
achievements immediately at the worlds
doorstep and when the world was ap-
prised that it had added to itself a new
citizen-and such a citizen -a huzzah
went up in the streets and the marts and
the palaces that for a moment drowned
out the tortured curses of the city of
seton

physics feverish activity engulfed the
world

  after seton women everywhere lone-
ly homeless or even merely adventurous
had come forward to offer themselves
mithrad ended that women who went
into the future he said would not live to
arrive in gayln the rigors of the jour-
ney consuming a space of two years
would wear them out only part of them
would endure half of it

  though the world had not particularly
thought of it they knew then there was
no compromise or surrender

  much more they learned in the days
that followed

  mithrad was a master of philology he
knew the thousand languages and dialects
of a thousand ages through machines
that cut across the dimensions of time
and space his age had accumulated the
knowledge and history of all times his
own study had been that of the lan-
guages  that ability had prompted his
choice as spokesman for the present expe-
dition

  much much more he knew that he let
fall in driblets from time to time it was
only out of an elementary knowledge in
the matter he said that he was furnish-
ing plans for the defense of earth his
friends the truly great scientists were
aboard the ship now slaves to the harsh
men of gayln

  but all this took time

  and the strangers came out of their
ship again

  the population had been rippling out
hundreds of mites in all directions from
seton fleeing as fast as wheel and pro-
peller could turn but flight was vain

  they came three days later their
flight mocked the speed of their prey de-
sultory firing they silenced with the flick
of a finger down they came and off they
flew and the horrified world could only
stare in dismay throttle lunacy and
plunge more grimly into its preparations

  under cover of night at various points
on the horizon about that solar apparition
fantastic piles of machinery crept into

being here the artistry of our own race
came into its own and a beautiful camou-
flage hid before the dawn the progress
of each nights work herculean effort
went into the structures and working in
guarded shadow life and limb were mere
items to be shed recklessly and cheerfully
in the common good

  the dawn then came after inconceiv-
able labors after difficulties almost insur-
mountable when the world was ready

  the final military campaign was a
weird hazardous conglomeration of the
battle tactics of two remote ages the
lowly trench mortar rubbed elbows with
massive intricate dynamos new to the face
of the world and as the zero hour ap-
proached men donned homely gas masks
and misshapen sacks of black

  three days before christmas just
eight days after the arrival of the red
men out of far-off gayln the two ages
locked in a battle outside the realms of
experience

  that day the doors of the ship again
released their sinister black swarms for
the last time the men crouching in their
hidden crannies waited long for the word
to test their vengeance and long the
world was delayed still the black flutter-
ing figures came streaming from the
craft

	the first unit of the defense went into

  action

  invisible from miles away ton on ton
of insidious tear-gas went streaming over
the landscape gently before noiseless
motors it was wafted toward that com-
mon center the air became saturated
with it to a thousand feet and still the
invaders were unaware of it

  then the word came men leapt to
switches dynamos worked to humming
life the ground started quivering in-
visible electrical forces went out in beams
toward the scintillating globe of fire and
its hovering cordon of gleaming shapes

  those shapes went into a sudden fren-
zy of action here there they swept in a
fury of flight their lightnings snapped
and crashed trees and earth writhed and
the men from gayln



blazed and many a man despite his in-
sulations his lightning arresters and his
triple groundings shriveled to instantane-
ous death

   out in the center of the field the laden
atmosphere grew heavy with high poten-
tial as invisible combating energies
strained at each other the rising roar of
the dynamos in a step-up tide of vibration
seemed to quiver the universe the livid
ball gleamed golden and intensified

  men could only wait sturdily for death
while forces they did not see could not
understand battled for them in another
dimension

  slowly with the entire power of the
earth pitted against the limited resources
of that separate alien entity the strength
of earth climbed the ball of fire glowed
not quite so brightly the flame grew
duller it wavered the little black figures
in an access of activity crowded and
jostled at the entries gone was all
thought of offense they were trying now
to get away

  suddenly with a last dying upflare of
light the glittering sheath the protective
veil vanished with its going went the
wisps of violet light from the fliers then
the tear gas took them like plummets
they dropped from their heights to sprawl
in agony from the interior a few
emerged to drop instantly but the gas
was already seeping through the open-
ings sinking in and down striking into
all corners the ship was silent

  the men of earth a hundred thousand
of them were already in motion exalta-
tion lifted them almost beyond bearing as
they sped over the plain as they scaled
the golden sides and penetrated danger-
ous interiors many a man forgetful of
gas shouted in holy glee and took a lung-
ful of paralyzer

   two hours later the rescued hysterical
femininity of a race was on its way home-
ward under proud protective tender
care

  and the proud red supermen of gayln
stripped of their belts of power weak and
ordinary as the mortal men they were
were herded to the wire enclosures pre-
pared for them

 from that day we may say dates the

  golden age of our world we of today
find all this too new to grasp too stu-
pendous to appreciate to mithrad and to
the fellow-scientists that he saved from
the ship the world owes its dimensional
transversers its time and space transpos-
ers ionic transmutation and degravita-
tion and flying machines that utilize the
polar magnetic waves

  to them we owe the discovery of and
intercourse with the myriad parallel
worlds which to us smack of the super-
natural and which are our refuge and
solace when particularly dear ones move
on to them

  to these scientists we owe the aboli-
tion of disease and disfiguration we owe
the transplantation of the vital organs
and the lengthening of the human life
span

  and all is not yet every day brings
its new contribution from them to spur
man on his road toward the heights

  our women comically speak of segre-
gating themselves for the establishment
of a superior home-loving peaceful race
but that is a matter for the tenth genera-
tion

  certainly the people of galyn have
more than made up to us for the loss and
anguish they caused in the recent invasion
of the time-raiders from the eastern
hemisphere

what has gone before

	hackworth an explorer in africa m 

  discovers his missing cousin williams who
had been lost in the jungle for the past forty
years and become a leader of a band of natives
williams is brought back to civilization and is
astounded at the tremendous changes that have
taken place there had been a terrific war
shortly after he left america much greater than
the world war after which a group of scien-
tists seized the governments of america and
europe and set up unitaria a scientific or-
ganization which brought mankind to greater
heights than he had ever before attained

  hackworth learns that his daughter who is in
love with a young chemist named terry spath is
foreed by the unitaria to marry a scientist
whom she had never seen before she had rated
so high in the government test that it was
thought that her union wjth one of equal men-
tality would produce highly intelligent children
hackworth williams and terry are horrified
at this never expecting that she would pass
the test then wihiatns shows them a solution
from an african plant that he had brought
back with him it was a drug that would put
any living thing into suspended animation for
an indefinite length of time they would only
awaken when commanded to do so by a desig-
nated person this drug is administered to lila
hackworths daughter in order to stall off the
marriage until something further could be done
the scientists of unitaria are puzzled at lilas
peculiar affliction and put her in a hospital she
was told by hypnotic influence while going un-
der the drug to awaken only when terry com-
manded her to

  the three men tax their mental resources to
think up some way of getting lila away from
unitaria and the eugenics law which would
force her into an unhappy marriage a part
one closes williams rs being shown around
unitaria and they are approaching the uniduin
capitol in new york gty now go on with the
siory

   	now that we have had an introduction
   into unitaria the super-civilization of
    we are ready for the astounding ad
   ventures that are to follow hi rapid oc-
   cession

     williams has seen the virtues of uni-
   taria-and some of its unjust ruling
   such as the eugenics law which was
   about to force lila the daughter of wil-
   liams cousin hackworth to enter upon
   an unhappy marriage

     but the greatest revelation in his ufe
   is still to come he is about to learn some-
   thing so terrible in its scope so inhnmnn
   that it will change his entire life

     rarely has such a living picture of the
   future been written rarely has such
   logic and truth been put into a tale of
   science-fiction you will remember thia
   story for years to come as one of the
   most colorful portrayals of things as they
   are to be that you have ever read

chapter v
an enslaved brain

	williams gasped in sheer astonishment

  just on the eastern side of brooklyn
was a large group of magnificent domed
buildings of marble and copper shining
in the sun with blinding intensity they
covered roughly five square miles of
ground and centered around a majestic
structure that looked like a castle of old
retouched with the inspired finger of a
futuristic artist it was a hive of activity
aircraft rising and descending autos
creeping like ants and tiny dots entering
and leaving the various buildings

  this then is the place where the des-
tiny of half a billion souls is centered
commented williams with awe he sud-
denly realized forcefully just what a gar-
gantuan state unitaria was-the old
united states canada mcxico then
over to the old world britain ger-

many huge russia  it seemed im-
possible in scope

  hackworth began to manoeuver down-
ward when they had passed the unidum
capitol he sped the plane forward final-
ly two thousand feet above ground

  long island city clustered on the
coast half way between the two tips of
its namesake island it had been founded
in  along with the simultaneous
founding of the capitol being purely a
residence city for the tens of thousands
of unidum employees it had been ar-
ranged with an eye for beauty from the
air it gave the impression of a sleepy mid-
western town that had grown to a city
without changing its rural aspect thou-
sands of picturesque sometimes quaint
bungalows and low apartment hotels
dotted the uniform carpet of lush green
grass and endless rows of elms and pop-
lars lent it a quiet woodland air

  hackworth landed at one of the many
small airports and left the plane in
charge of the hangar attendants a half-
mile walk down shady avenues brought
them before a dwelling of stucco and
peaked gables

  williams was introduced to the man
who answered the doorbell - andrew
grant secretary to executive ashley of
the unidum he was a short slight man
of fifty bald and spectacled his sonorous
voice seemed out of keeping with his
physical being

  he greeted the visitors warmly and
conducted them to the lounge hack-
worth did not delay long in coming to
the point

  andrew he said ive never dropped
iri on you before except to pay a social
call but this time its for a purpose

  grant lifted bushy eyebrows in instant
attention

  its about lila continued hack-
worth yon know of course that she
has taken the eugenics test and found
to be of the type needed to be the mother
of a scientists children

  oh i was sorry about that when i
heard the news said grant quickly
lila is a wonderful girl and young

terry- suppose hes broken-hearted

  naturally none of us felt any too
pleased about the whole thing in fact-
he paused then andrew you will hold
anything i say in utmost confidence

  surely you know me well enough
for that

  well lila at present is in a condition
preventing her marriage to a scientist
which should have taken place three days
ago while this impasse holds young
spath mr williams here and myself
are going to try to save lila from the
eugenics law i have come to you in the
hope that you may be able to help

  grant had suddenly turned very grave
he hastily looked about the room as
though fearing eavesdroppers it was
treason talk

  lord he breathed what do you
mean 

  isnt there any possible way to annul
or veto the unidum decree in this mat-
ter asked hackworth with a note of
pleading in his voice

  there was a pause before grant an-
swered his eyes avoided those of his
friend

  well  earl now really its
unheard of annul it veto it unidum
decrees are not subject to repeal you
should know that

  hackworth threw an i told you so
glance of helplessness to williams he
heaved a weary sigh and turned to grant

  i know that andrew but you cant
blame me for trying  after all it
is a fathers heart that prompts me sup-
pose your daughter elaine who wih soon
be eligible for marriage loved a young
man and-

  grants face suddenly paling checked
hackworth

  im sorry he ended apologetically

  grant came to his feet and paced up
and down for a minute obviously
wrought-up then he whirled

  youre right earl he said tensely
elaine will have to take the test herself
soon she has met a young man 

that eugenics law-a thousand
curses on it deep in my heart ive al-
enslaved brains



ways hated it and i know you and i
are not the only ones it is one of the
worst mistakes the unidum has ever
made id like to help you earl if only
because of the thought of my own daugh-
ter and her happiness you say lila is
in a condition preventing marriage is
she ill

  thereupon hackworth told the whole
story of the drug and their plans grant
showed his extreme surprise and looked
at williams with a new interest

  now that i know the whole story
said grant im going to do my level best
to help lila ive got connections in the
unidum that may-and again may not-
result in her release dont mistake me
im not underestimating the task as far
as i know no woman has ever been re-
leased from the eugenics law but there
is a first time to everything now give
me say a weeks time in which to do some
guarded investigation

  if only lila doesnt awaken in that
time muttered hackworth

  she wont to all indications inter-
posed williams quickly i feel almost
certain call it jungle instinct that only
terrys voice can bring her back from
drugged sleep

  ill call you by private radiophone
concluded grant in a weeks time or
less

  hackworth arose and gripped his hand
in silent gratitude

	 

  the day after their visit to andrew
grant hackworth decided to show his
cousin something of the internal work-
ings of a modern city since he had al-
ready seen new york from the outside

  you know dan he said before they
started one of the reasons the standard
of living is so high in  is because
machines have come to do a great deal
of the worlds work unitaria especially
is a highly mechanized civilization so
much of the work is done by machines
that what is left is easily accomplished by
a maximum working week of thirty hours

for unitaria citizens and the total pro-
duction is so great that there is more than
enough for the comfort of all ill take
you around today to various industries
so you can see the machines

  using electro-car transportation they
spent a whole day going around to new
yorks various industries williams lost
himself in a dream of wonder factories
were usually large clean establishments
crammed with a bewildering maze of
machines tended by humans who looked
puny and futile beside them tireless
metallic moving parts twinkled up and
down and in and out they seemed to
wink at williams as though saying
isnt this easy though finished prod-
ucts spewed forth in steady streams into
automatic receivers that carried them
away for packing and distribution

  how efficient and quiet it all was no
clanging and banging and ear-splitting
discordance as had been the bane of
s ponderous machinery the en-
gineers had practically eliminated un-
necessary noises a smell of pleasantly
perfumed oils and lubricants hovered near
the machines the comfort of the at-
tendants had been thought of to the last
degree

  williams could not help noticing that
most of the workers seemed cheerful
did not seem to mind their tasks at all
they were all uniformed and added to
the pleasing aspect of the neat machine-
rooms

  hackworth reflected a certain pride as
he explained what he knew-pride that
 had improved working conditions
so greatly over  not once was there
a suggestion of the old-time sweaty
grimy ill-ventilated gloomy screeching
machine-rooms of forty years before

  their final stqp was at the food prod-
ucts branch e where terry worked the
unidum had long ago taken over all food
products sinoe it was such an important
thing in the lives of humanity branch e
produced only one thing a vitaminized
impalpable powder which went into every
and all foods consumed in unitaria

	terry whose working day had just

  come to an end joined them and took
them through the plant he brought them
first before a series of seven apparatuses
different from any williams had seen all
that day they seemed to be a hybrid
between an enlarged clock-work and a
chemical laboratory pumps drove col-
ored liquids through thick quartz tubes
misted gases swirled violently in trans-
parent chambers huge rollers ground and
ground in flat pans containing heaps of
lumped materials

  these seven machines explained
terry are the initial steps in the manu-
facture of the seven vitamins needed in
a balanced diet into them the raw prod-
ucts are fed through those chutes which
are complicated organic compounds pro-
duced at the unidums chemical works
these machines grind it and perform cer-
tain reactions that start the building of
the intricate vitamin molecules but they
only perform step one before the new
compounds undergo further chemical re-
action they are tested by analysts

  they passed to the next room which
also housed seven machines but vastly
different from the first seven these were
a conglomerate of millions of tubes re-
torts boiling liquids and swirling solu-
tions

  here the molecules are further rear-
ranged toward the ultimate vitamin mole-
cules rigid teste are performed before
they pass on batches now and then turn
out wrong and have to be thrown out or
re-worked

  each room in turn had new and strange
apparatus hundreds of people tended
them and took out samples for testing
which were sent by a tube system to the
laboratories yet strangely enough re-
flected williams no one seemed to ac-
tually have anything to do zvith the ma-
chinery in the other industries there had
always been men before control-boards
which gave an accurate resume of the
machinerys operation here the machines
went on endlessly as though having been
nee started there could be no fluctua-
tion in their production

  these machines are marvellous wil-
liams finally remarked are they built
so perfectly that no interference with
them is necessary

  they used to have control-boards
answered terry just like other machin-
ery but five years ago this plant was
outfitted with a controlling mechanism
that replaced human attendance only
when a part wears out or breaks down
must a human being put his hands in the
running of the units

  what sort of astounding control
mechanism can that be

  come ill show you

  but hackworths voice made them
pause

  lets pass that up he said with an
oddly hurried voice its  er-look
how late it is we must get home for din-
ner

  pshaw  cried williams dinner can
wait this sounds too interesting to
miss

  he turned to terry about to say
lets go but noticed that he seemed
suddenly perturbed a covert look passed
between him and hackworth that wil-
liams keen eyes caught

  perhaps youd rather  rather go
home to dinner said terry biting his
lips as though caught in some embarras-
sing misdemeanor

  williams looked from one to the
other

  well what is it he asked quietly
you know better than to fool me now
terry looked helplessly at hackworth
flushing

  im sorry-i should have thought-
hackworth motioned to a corner of
the room where they would be out of
ear-shot of the workers

  never mind terry he said we
could not have withheld it indefinitely
anyway he turned slowly to williams
dan the controlling mechanism for all
these machines is  a brain-a tu-
man brain f

  williams almost staggered

  sarto je bru he gasped a human
brain a living brain
enslaved brains



  no cried hackworth he spoke
rapidly now not a living brain in the
true sense of the word but-

  he broke off and began again a brain
taken from a dead body and rejuvenated
somehow so that it can still perform men-
tal tasks technically i dont suppose
anybody can explain how its done ex-
cept perhaps the scientists-

  the scientists again burst in wil-
liams it sounds just as inhuman as the
eugenics law

  he breathed a moment deeply as
though controlling violent emotions the
others stood as though stricken

  lets go said williams quietly after
a moment and see it

  terry led the way up steps to the floor
above its long hallway had numerous
alternate rooms which contained stores of
chemicals at the exact center of the en-
tire branch e building it led to a circular
chamber from which came the sound of
clicking relays

  they stepped into an open doorway
and onto a platform only a few yards
square surrounded by a railing a neon
sign above read visitors must not
smoke

  the sight that met williams eyes as
he stepped on the platform brought an
involuntary cry of amazement to his lips
the entire wall-surface with the exception
of the part near the doorway was taken
up by an unbroken control-board with
thousands of relays-tiny contact mag-
nets-and pilot lights there was a con-
stant ticking noise and twinkling of the
tiny globes across the ceiling from the
boards stretched innumerable insulated
wires a tremendous network of them to
the affair in the center of the room

  this latter object riveted williams
gaze after he had taken in the control-
board it consisted of a cylindrical solid
base of metal surmounted by an intricate
system of what seemed to be mirrors and
tubes but topping that was another object
that brought a quick contraction to wil-
liams brow

  it was a circular glass globe suspended
from the ceiling by a thick rod of metal

from it led a trail of diousands of fine
silver wires which connected to the mir-
rored mechanism below from opposite
points of the globe led two thin tubes
which ran parallel after meeting at die
back down to a black metal box on die
floor of the room

  that must be the brain murmured
williams staring at it he could faintly
make out the irregular outline of a
greyish object suspended in a viscid liquid
inside the globe

  terry began softly explaining know-
ing that williams would ask about it

  the brain is suspended in a nutritive
fluid which is pumped up and down those
two tubes from the black box that con-
tains what might be called a mechanical
heart the mirrors and photoelectric
tubes are the eyes of the brain with
which it examines the readings of the
gauges next to the wall relays by some
intricate system of semi-nerve control it
operates the various relays and switches
which keep the machines below running
smoothly and regularly

  how can one brain control  many
machines when it would take dozens of
attendants otherwise

  because every cell of the brain is used
in life we never use the full capacity of
our brains much of it lies dormant sub-
conscious

  what if a part breaks down either
here or below surely the brain cant do
anything about that 

  no the brain merely controls the
power input and product output and
takes care of variations for instance if
the raw product put into any one machine
happens to be especially hard to grind into
powder and takes longer to crush the
brain-control automatically adjusts de
timing to fit the new conditions but
whenever repairs are needed the braln-
control merely flashes a signal along a
special communication system this sig-
nal goes to the central office of branch e
where the official in charge at the time
sends a repairman to the required ma-
chine sometimes for days at a time tlie
whole system of machines of branch e

operates without the intervention of hu-
man hands except of course the routine
testing

  dan williams suddenly sickened of the
sight and turned away the mere thought
of a human brain-once having occupied
a living body like his own-perched up
there like a frosty evil eye turned him
cold there is a sort of delicate feeling in
ail human beings that revolts against
thought of any human organ being taken
from the grave from its rightful resting
place and brought to the harsh light of
the upper world ashes to ashes and
dust to dust- and this thing-hanging
there fed by a mechanical heart - he
shuddered

  they left and went to the hackworth
home for a belated dinner terry with
them having been invited by hackworth
all of them felt depressed and subdued
after the meal they sat and smoked in
the lounge exchanging a few words on
the subject of machinery but williams
resolutely avoided referring to the brain-
control and his companions were secretly
relieved hackworth knowing his cousins
 prejudices had expected him to
show more feeling about the brain-con-
trol after all it was a gruesome thing to
be so suddenly revealed to a person from
an age when even vivisection had been de-
claimed by pious people

  suddenly hackworth turned a deathly
white

  williams had just asked a question he
had hoped would never be uttered by his
lips by the way where was my sister
helen buried 

  if williams had not had a keen mind
he might have merely asked his cousin if
he were ill and advised him to go to bed
but in a flash his thoughts seared to a
horrible culmination

  nothing was said for a minute but the
question seemed to be still ringing in the
room and williams eyes still asked the
answer as they bored flint-like at hack-
worth

  hackworth would have given half his
wcahh to lie his way out of it but he

knew those steady blue eyes would detect
the slightest sign of prevarication

  dont  dont ask me that he
almost screamed

  i want to know said williams im-
placably the truth he added

chapter vi
a terrible revelotion

	hackworth waved a hand that said
  then  have no choice

  dan he said aloud helens body
was cremated by the unidum after her
brain was removed and-

  god cried williams his face work-
ing helens brain- he trailed off into
muttered bantu dialect then there was a
long silence hackworth looked at a rug
design in abject misery he had hoped
that the subject would never come to
light but subconsciously he had known it
was inevitable williams only link with
the past with his father dead had been
his sister he waited for his bronzed
cousin to break out in violent anger as he
had at the cold-blooded eugenics law

  but when williams spoke his voice
was quiet ominously controlled

  begin at the beginning and tell me
about the whole thing he demanded
and how my sister came to be in-
volved

  at a sign from hackworth terry
spoke for he was more familiar with the
scientific aspects of the modern world
than the older man

  it was just five years ago began the
young chemist that a scientist whose
name is unknown succeeded in an experi-
ment upon which he had labored it is
said for many years he announced that
his work made it possible to take the brain
from a dead person before decomposition
had advanced and bring back to it a
semblance of life-not actual life you un-
derstand for then they could apply the
method to the brain in the body but a
sort of semi-subconscious existence his
exhaustive tests had shown that this re-
juvenated brain could still exert its full
intellectual resources if given a mechan-
enslaved brains



ical contact with the living world imme-
diately the scientists saw a use for such
a dead-alive brain a substitute for a liv-
ing brain or group of brains since the
owner of the brain was officially dead
and since the unidum had authority to
conscript any bodies or parts of bodies
under the vivisection law it was decid-
ed to use such dead-alive brains for the
benefit of the state

  why for what purpose asked
williams havent you told me already
that working hours are short if the
brain-control supplants but say fifty
workers it means little in the total mass
of people

  yes nodded terry but suppose all
machines were given brain-control that
would release millions upon millions of
workers the work could then be redivid-
ed and cut the working week to twelve or
fifteen hours

  and the people would die of bore-
dom said williams deprecatingly al-
ready as earl has told me the people of
unitaria hardly know what to do with
their leisure time what possible advan-
tage would more leisure time bring 
that i dont know said terry shak-
ing his head the unidum has been
rather secretive about their motives in
this matter of course that will not be a
paramount question till many years in the
future at present there are only about
 brain-controls in unitaria and as
yet the only machines fitted with them
arc the vitamin units of the food products
system

  but andrew grant has told me confi-
dentially interposed hackworth that
plans are going through now to begin
outfitting all food products machinery
with brain-controls

  which means added williams that
the unidum is determined to increase the
use of them without a logical reason for
doing so

  the logical reason returned hack-
worth half defiantly is to take more of
the load of work from human hands
but to what advantage asked wil-

liams again  idle hands do mischief
make  he quoted

  dan be reasonable answered hack-
worth the unidum has ruled wisely
and justly for thirty years and has met
all previous problems with an eye to the
future in this case they must have plans
of some sort to balance the shifting
amounts of work and leisure

  williams sprang to his feet and strode
up and down the room for a minute

  somehow he said half to himself
there seems to be something sinister be-
hind t can it be that the unidum is
retrograding as all systems of govern-
ment in past history rose to a peak and
then fell to decay

  hackworth and terry shot a guarded
glance to one another dan williams was
putting into words things that were only
breathed in unitaria hackworth in up-
holding the unidum had used mere
words for the sake of taking his cousins
mind from the thought of his sisters   

  williams was speaking again and
what is the public attitude toward the
brain-controls - that is if the public
dares to have an attitude in this day of
scientific dictatorship he finished some-
what bitterly

  public opinion is divided answered
hackworth for the most part especial-
ly among the workers who tend machines
it is considered a great advancement
they envision the day when everyone will
be his own master for the greater part of
his life but to tell the truth there lias
also been much disapproval mainly by
those who believe it is sacrilegious to  
to disturb the dead as you do

  and as you do said williams quick-
ly facing his cousin

  yes as i do admitted hackworth
unable to meet the others eyes

  and now terry said williams fac-
ing the younger man what more can you
tell me about the brain itself that is used
like a piece of super-sensitive machinery
to control machinery in place of humans
it must think and if it thinks it is not
really dead and if it is nt actually dead


wonder stories for august 

it must feel must have emotion cr con-
sciousness of some sort

  hackworth blanched and remonstrated
inarticulately but terry answered a pair
of compelling blue eyes

  yes they do feel cried the young
chemist he faced the father of the girl
he loved mr hackworth there is no
use withholding these things they cant
be denied ill tell him all

  hackworth slumped back in his chair

  the brains do feel continued terry
with his eyes on williams they have a
residue of conscious life enough to make
it purgatory for them they know what
its all about thex live in an endless
hell

  he went on rapidly now in a flood of
words

  for three years now ive worked at
branch e always ive been tortured by
the thought of that sentient brain up-
stairs sending its impulses through cold
silver wires directing dozens of compli-
cated machines it must be a living night-
mare hour after hour day after day
the brain cannot rebel the scientists
have them under some hypnotic or
drugged spell but they can feel they
can remember their former life they
know pain weariness despair futile an-
ger-just as living persons it has been
proven two men scientists themselves
investigated and proved it they were
humane and not blinded by scientific zeal
but when they attempted to tell the
world the unidum hounded them drove
them out perhaps killed them-no one
knows rumors spread like wildfire their
statements leaked out but only a few
like myself believe them the rest are
content to think of the brain-controls as
organic machinery and to believe the
unidum which promises a future state in
which each human will work only a small
part of the time but they forget the mis-
ery of the brains sometimes  think
what if my brain were taken from my
dead body and  everyone is faced
with that there can be no more rest in
peace now

  hackworth had listened in great aston-

ishment not at the revelations but at
terrys own emotional outburst he had
never realized that the young chemist had
such violent antipathy toward the brain
control innovation

  the effect of these words on williams
was fearful to behold a livid fire shot
from his eyes his lips twisted into a hid-
eous snarl zulus in africa had seen that
expression and turned ashen under their
black skin it was a compound of mighty
rage and purple hatred terry quailed be-
fore him as he saw powerful shoulders
knot into corded muscles under his shirt
he seemed about to spring to attack

  but suddenly williams relaxed his
features smoothed to normal he glanced
apologetically at the other two men

  earl he asked his cousin how did
they come to use helens  brain
it was just at the time that the first
brain-controls were made five years ago
that helen died since newly deceased
persons only could furnish undecayed
brains all those who died on that certain
day were conscripted by the unidum
their names were published as being
honored in being the first to initiate
that great advancement in science as it
was called the unidum saw its mistake
for there were riots that same day-
friends and relatives of the honored de-
ceased but the unidum did not see its
greatest mistake in ever authorizing the
use of brain-controls and to this day
it does not see it or does not care to see
it

  has there been no protest no organ-
ized opposition

  not as yet although feeling has run
high at times

  sarto what sort of a world is this
exclaimed williams an inhuman cold-
blooded repulsive scientific horror like
that and nothing is done and the eu-
genics law again inhuman and anti-so-
cial and there are no people of spirit to
revolt

  revolt the unidum is all-powerful
-practically a dictatorship and the reg-
ulating pendulum is a group of scientists
to whom both the eugenics law and the
enslaved brains



brain-control movement are laudable ad-
vancements what can the masses do
what can you expect them to do when the
unidum has given them a hundred bene-
fits never known on earth before re-
member dan as ive said before the
unidum has done far more good than
harm

  i suppose i should look at it that
way answered williams yet mistakes
can multiply and the mere thought of
helen 

  tell me where is the brain-control
which-

  i dont know

  you do

  dan i tell you    

 hackworth sweated a moment under
the adamant blue eyes of his cousin and
then whispered boston

  then im going to boston

 what do you mean cried hack-
worth scrambling to his feet

  i simply mean that if its the last act
of my life im going to see that my sis-
ters  brain dies its proper death
youre mad

  do you think i could live in peace or
die in peace knowing helen all that is
still conscious of her lies in perpetual
torment 

  but there is nothing you can do its
been tried before hackworth turned
with a note of pleading to the young
chemist you tell him terry you tell
him its impossible

  yes thats right mr williams said
tern- you could do nothing

  i can wreck the whole control
even if you break all the contacts and
smash the mirror-eves returned terry
the brain does not die as long as the
nutritive fluid surrounds it it lives you
cant harm that because the mechanical
heart is enclosed in heavy steel no key
will open its lock except one that the
scientist has who renews the fluid pe-
riodically the pipes leading upward are
out of reach so is the brain-case out of
reach

  what would a well-aimed bullet do if
it struck the brain-case 

  why smash it but you need a gun
for that

  and you cant get a gun no matter
how hard you try interposed hack-
worth you remember i left all my guns
at kabinda africa no one can import a
gun into unitaria and none are sold here
either the unidum has completely dis-
armed the citizens of unitaria

	williams drew his brows together
thoughtfully at this it began to look
less simple than at first

  nevertheless im going to boston and
look the thing over he said firmly
somehow sometime ill figure out a
way

  but lila dan you havent forgot-
ten-

  no earl i havent however in the
case of lila we can do nothing till we
hear from andrew grant in the mean-
time  will go to boston and-

  you will do nothing rash pleaded
hackworth the unidum is quick to
punish and any trouble with them might
eventually involve lila through you

 but williams was suddenly lost in rev-
erie quite as suddenly a few minutes
later he bade them good night and left the
room

  hackworth turned a grave face to
young spath

  im afraid dan has taken the news to
heart there was a close bond between
himself and his sister he is a man of
sudden though not always wise deci-
sions perhaps it would he wise for you
terry to accompany him to boston to-
morrow he might try something rash
that you could prevent

  certainly agreed the young chem-
ist i can get the day off from work
good you will sleep here tonight as
for that servant of his mbopo im go-
ing to keep him here with me tomorrow
in his present mood dan is very liable
to get violent if mbopo is along one
word in dialect will start him fighting
and between the two of them they would
make plenty of trouble perhaps after


wonder stories for august 

dan secs the brain-control in boston and
realizes his helplessness he will gradually
calm down over it

  they went to bed then

  up in his room williams carefully un-
wrapped the layers of hide in the soft
light of a shaded lamp and looked at the
contents of his bundle there were sev-
eral things he had taken along with him
from africa a tigers tooth of odd shape
reputed to be a potent charm several
other trinkets with a personal history be-
hind them and a soft giraffe skin pouch
which he reflected would make a nice gift
for lila he set them all down except the
tigers tooth this he put into his pocket
with a sheepish grin africa had left in
him a faint vestige of native superstition

  he fingered the other articles for an
hour exchanging short comments with
mbopo on them living in a dream of the
visions they aroused of the past then he
heaped them together on the dresser-top

  undressing he looked through the win-
dow and saw the small bustle of suburban
new york it had started raining a warm
september rain it blurred the scenery
he saw a sweeping jungle  a shad-
owed desert  moving forms that
might be gnus grazing in the brush 

  he started no it was a street of new
york it was  this was not africa
it was unitaria it was a new world with
many strange things hyp-marines sans-
run aircraft spanned cities a new gov-
ernment and a multitude of blessings to
mankind but then there was the inhuman
eugenics law  and the hideous
brain-control 

  even in his sleep he clenched his fists
and creased his brow

  mbopo had quietly undressed and
stretched out on the rug beside the bed
his master had hardly noticed him in the
past few days but it was enough to satis-
fy his simple soul during the times they
were separated the black man had either
sat languidly in some corner of the house
dreaming of africa or had tuned the
television set and watched the queer suc-
cession of pictures from all over the

world his master had asked him several
times if he tired of this new life and
wished to return to africa each time the
black man had denied nostalgia and insist-
ed he must stay by the side of the onto
akku each night he slept on the rug of
his bed one might wonder just how im-
portant his existence was in the events
that followed

chapter vii
disaster

	as the giant six-motored passenger

  plane hurtled high above new york
on its way to boston william took a last
look at the city below rapidly rolling
backward under them like a geometri-
cians paradise it spread back from the
ocean bizarrely unreal in the gloom of a
cloudy day he could faintly make out
the unidum capitol far to the right then
the city faded into the murkiness below
was farmland ribboned with broad high-
ways along which tiny dots moved inces-
santly

  williams was in a blank mood the
revelations of the evening before had
seemed grotesque after a nights sleep
brains in machines how impossible
brains officially dead with an after-life
running machinery doing work think-
ing sending out nervous impulses feel-
ing sarto could such a thing be could
a dead brain feel  or was terry wrong
after all could the spirit or conscious-
ness that had once been helen williams
be actually captured in a glass globe and
forced to do endless relay-inanipulations 
could the brain of that sweet young girl
of long ago be in a state where the poign-
ant memories of happy life tortured it
while some diabolical influence kept its
nerve oenters throbbing messages along
silver wires

  williams broke his spell and turned his
face to terry beside him who had kept a
respectful silence he must clear his mind
of the blankness of whirling conjecture

  while we have the chance terry sup-
pose you tell me something more about
 of which i know only too little as
enslaved brains



yet tell me about motive power today
what fuels and energies you use

  terry willingly launched into the sub-
ject glad that the older mans obvious
brooding had finally evaporated by plac-
ing his lips close to the others ear he
was able to speak above the engine noise
without strain

  in  he began coal and natural
oil furnished the bulk of power in europe
and america today in  half of uni-
tarias power output is from a dream of
your time come true-namely tide-ma-
ehines all the sea-coast cities and those
a few hundred miles inland are supplied
with cheap electrical power up and down
every important coast are several large
tide-stations as they are called which
convert the tide movements into hundreds
of thousands of kilowatts of energy
from these it is wired via beryllium ca-
bles to the various cities much of this
power is then transmitted for use through
ether broadcast for instance in new
york the electro-cars run around without
overhead trolleys or third rails they
get their power from the ether i wont
begin to describe-in fact i couldnt-
the complex system of automatic units
which attach beams oi radio energy be-
tween the central power station and the
many electro-cars many inland cities as
far west as pittsburgh are supplied with
ether energy from the long island tide-
station

  the other half of unitarias power
still comes from natural deposits of coal
and oil but oil is fast petering out and
supplies but a small part today in 
coal is never burned as such the gases
and tars are extracted for the chemical in-
dustries as in your time and only the
coke is used for power yet neither is the
coke burned by what is called hydro-
genation it is converted into oils and
gasolines at will which burn much more
efficiently than the coke itself

  this liquid fuel runs our railroad
trains our aircraft our automobiles and
our ocean craft diesel engines have gone
far in replacing light fuel engines in fact
all railroad trains and ocean craft are

equipped with diesels that burn coke-oij
in the cities unable to use tide-power by
being too far inland internal combustion
engines make electricity which is used di-
rectly without ether broadcast in central
europe in what used to be germany
rocket-turbines are used with fair suc-
cess places that produce water power are
still in operation as niagara and a cer-
tain amount of wind power is also pro-
duced

  with the advent of cheap oil from
coal the aircraft immediately began re-
placing surface transportation methods
and that replacing process is still going
on perhaps in another forty years every-
thing will go through the air the byp-
marines which carry half the ocean eonv
meree are really aircraft more than any-
thing else

  and just as in  they dreamed of
tide-engines and rocket motive power and
stratosphere flights which are accom-
plished today so do inventors today
dream and labor toward sun-power en-
gines earth-heat motors and even grav-
ity-nullifying apparatus probably the
next forty years will see those things
come to pass

  boston revealed itself dimly in fog
wisps as a smaller edition of new york
city spider spans and threads knitted its
business section so heavily that williams
abstractedly wondered if alt the buildings
would arise if a cyclops were to pick up
oue with a suitably large tweezers like
an artificial whale a hyp-marine was
coming over the horizon skimming the
water

  their ship began to descend and veer
till it was in the right lane then it bored
to a position over the tall buildings and
swooped gently it landed like an angry
dragon on the immense flat roof of the
main air terminal

  do you know which brain-control we
want to see asked williams as they
walked away from the ship along the pe-
destrian path

  there is only one in boston an
swered terry as in all large cities ex-
cept new york and london which have

two each as yet the use of brain-con-
trols is little better than experimental

  an experiment that should never have
taken place muttered williams to him-
self thinking of his sister

  escalators took them upward to one of
the hanging platform stations of the pub-
lic transportation system williams
looked with new interest at the electro-
car that slid to a noiseless stop he found
it hard to lelieve that it derived its power
from an ether beam ten minutes of blur-
ring speed and side-pressing curves
brought them to branch g of boston food
products both inside and out it was very
similar to branch e in new york on
the ground floor were the machines and
analytical laboratories on the second
floor were store-rooms and the all-impor-
tant brain-control and the less spacious
top floor contained only offices

  williams approached the brain-control
room with a thumping heart his sisters
    how gruesome a thought

  a group of sightseers was just leaving
the chamber when terry and williams
came to it a look of dull amazement was
on every face one could not see the
brain-control without feeling stunned by
the wonder of it

  they entered williams swept his eyes
around at the multitudinous magnet re-
lays and lighted dials at the tewildering
maze of taut wires above and then slow-
ly fearfully turned his face to the lumi-
nescent globe high in the center of the
room suspended from a ceiling support

  je bru il bra a sweat broke out on
his forehead and he flung his eyes des-
perately downward unable to gaze at the
globe that held his sisters brain and think
rationally at the same time

  as he dropped his eyes he noticed for
the first time a man standing before the
black box at the base of the cylindrical
mirror support dark-haired and burly
and dressed in conventional clothing with
a light cape of blue cloth over his shoul-
ders he was busjf at the black box

  a scientist whispered terry point-
ing changing the nutritive supply

	williams looked with renewed interest

  it was the first of that group of 
scientists that he had ever seen on his
cape in the middle of his back was a de-
sign of a robot and young girl with a
background of intricate machinery under
the sun and blue sky which was the rest
of the cape the man himself was in the
prime of life and worked with sure fin-
gers his back was turned and he blocked
their view of the inside of the box whose
heavy steel door was open wide but they
saw him move a tall glass jar filled with
a thick colorless fluid from the box and
replace it with an exactly similar jar
which had stood beside him then his
hands went inside the box as he proceed-
ed to connect the new jar with the pump-
ing system

  leaning against the railing tensely
williams eyes moved along the black
box followed the two tubes upward and
fastened to the round globe it was all
like a dream there was his sisters brain
that man-that scientist-was fixing to
the mechanical heart a jar of liquid food
that would give semi-life to  to
helen so that she could continue to be a
slave to the machines below so that she
could send continual nerve-impulses along
cold silver wires and perhaps all the
while her consciousness or soul or what-
ever it was imprisoned in glass was re-
calling a life of far-happier memories
exquisite torture helen helen he
called in his heart perhaps by some
super-sense she saw him standing there
knew him as her brother even now she
might be pleading helplessly entreating
him to release her from such horrific
bondage yes she zvas he could feel it
now-waves of sharp and subtle influence
that shook his brain like an ultra-sound
organ note shakes the ground

  terry had kept an anxious eye on wil-
liams remembering hackworths admoni-
tions he had seen the strong play o
emotion in his face in his now fiery eyes
in the way he leaned against the ram and
had been perturbed but what happened
after williams had trembled like a leaf
terry was powerless to prevent
enslaved brains



  with a hoarse shout williams vaulted
over the rail he landed six feet below
cat-like

  terry shouted for him to stop but it
was too late mouthing shrill bantu male-
dictions primitive african in every
move williams streaked toward the
hlack box powerful hands outstretched as
though to grapple with some zulu enemy

  the scientist hearing the shouts
whirled and at the same time banged shut
the hlack boxs panel door the sight of a
brawny snarling man lunging at him with
berserk madness in his face froze the
scientist with numbing fear one ponder-
ous swing of williams arm bowled him
violently against the relays unconscious

  terry hy this time had recovered him-
self and also leaped to the floor level he
darted to his friend and attempted to
bring him to reason williams brushed
him away with a steel-spring arm and
continued kicking and battering at the
locked door of the black box only one
thought burned through his brain - to
smash the mechanical heart inside but it
was useless even his great muscles could
not affect inch-thick metal

  terry staggered erect from the floor
he looked at the crumpled scientist with
blood all over his face then he looked at
the man panting and cursing tearing at
the heavy pump-tubes above the box

  for gods sake weve got to get out
of here shouted terry but he knew
williams had not heard above a red
light was flashing intermittently the
alarm signal

  the guards-they will be here any
moment

  williams must have heard that and
dimly realized its significance for he
suddenly ceased his futile battering at the
black box and looked around desperately
his eye caught something lying on the
floor it was a small wrench used by the
scientist to fit the couplings on the necks
of the jars

  with a savage cry of triumph wil-r
liams picked it up poised it delicately be-
tween thumb and forefinger and hurled it

straight up at the brain-globe thirty feet
off the floor terry watched breathlessly
the tool arched upward turning over and
over like a thrown knife and 
glanced off the glass without breaking it

  in the midst of a shattering sound of
fragile mirrors and photo-electric tubes
as the tool fell downward there came the
shouts of men crowding the platforms
above figures clothed in uniforms of
blue and red cloth and shiny leather
leaped to the floor level and swarmed
toward them unidum police

  terry found himself fighting side by
side with williams with bare fists why
he was fighting he did not know except
that some breath of battle had flowed
from the angry man at his side and made
him forget all except the emotion of the
moment williams proved to be a cyclone
in disguise hard fists powered by
muscles that hercules might have had
plunged piston-like at faces and chests
sweating and grunting guards could lay
no hand on him

  and terry himself in sudden exalta-
tion threw his full strength into the bat-
tle it was a sensation new to him -
pounding at faces it was exhilarating
for a moment he forget everything ex-
cept that he and williams were beset by
enemies who must be knocked off their
feet the savage pleasure of it dimmed
his reason neither he nor williams saw
the man stealthily creeping to the back of
them from the other side of the black
box with a pistol-like object in his hand

  it was over quite suddenly the two
besieged men staggered and then crum-
pled to the floor paralyzedby an agoniz-
ing shock of livid lightning but before he
sank to unconsciousness terry took in
with one glance the scene on the floor-a
huddled group of guards with torn and
blood-spattered uniforms  and he
smiled to himself

	 

  im sorry and in a way not sorry
said williams through somewhat swollen
lips im sorry that i got you into a
mess terry but im not sorry that i


wonder stories for august 

tried my level best to  to smash
the globe

  terry put a hand on his shoulder

  i understand he said dont blame
yourself it was beyond your control
just the same as i would have been driven
to knock over professor jorgen - the
scientist who was to marry lila-had i
ever met him

  they were in the prison section of the
boston science court of the unidum
waiting for trial which would be that
very evening

  justice moves swiftly in  said
williams

  yes especially when the charge is
treason against the unidum

  treason repeated williams

  terry nodded glumly the brain-
control is unidum property no matter
how much we deny it they will charge us
with being connected with some sort of
secret organization plotting against the
unidum the jury since this case will be
tried by the science court will be com-
posed of scientists their verdict will be
unalterable and the sentence- terry
shuddered-more than we deserve

  would it help to tell the truth -
about  helen

  terry rubbed a bruised cheek thought-
fully

  im sure it wouldnt he said and it
might involve hackworth  and
lila williams its a hard thing to ask-

  the young chemist stopped agitated
then were in a bad predicament wil-
liams the verdict is sure to be treason
regardless of what we say for my part
i am willing to plead guilty to their initial
charge which wilt be treasonable action
against the unidum this will cut short
the trial and prevent the implication of
hackworth

  in that case said williams i will
do the same only i wish terry that you
had never come along with me

  terry shrugged his shoulders its not
myself im worried about but    
lila he leaned back in the hard prison
chair dejectedly

  williams cursed himself inwardly

why had he ever done such a thing so
futile and thoughtless there in the brain-
control room he had lost his head com-
pletely leaning against the railing
watching the scientist change the jars he
had metamorphosed into a savage un-
thinking jungle creature it had been like
a jekyll-and-hyde transformation sarto f
now he remembered - he had actually
imagined that his sisters brain had en-
treated him to give her soul freedom
from the glass globe it had swept all
sane thought from liis mind and now
here they were faced with stem sentence
by inexorable law all their plans were
disrupted with terry imprisoned and lila
out of reach

  it was a long and dreary afternoon
both immersed in gloom and feeling the
pain throbs of bruises and wrenched
muscles they spoke little

  the trial was short that evening it
took place in a huge court-room filled
with curious crowds the judge emo-
tionless and stern peered at the defend-
ants as though they were irresponsible
children every man of the jury wore the
blue cape with the symbolic insignia of
science the very atmosphere of the place
seemed cold implacable pitiless facing
the jury of scientists terry and wil-
liams pleaded guilty to the initial charge
of treasonable action against the unidum
tahis took the court by surprise and pre-
vented them putting in any further
charges of conspiracy had they denied the
misdemeanor and been cross-examined

  the technical presentation of the
charge after the judge had deliberated
the case delivered in funereal tones wil-
liams hardly heard the sentence-what
would that be he looked at the austere
frown on the judges brow and knew it
could not be light terry sat trembling be-
side him his face bloodless and drawn
in suspense

  then came the announcement of the
sentence williams heard clearly a group
of words that struck at his understand-
ing like powerful blows

  -just punishment will be painless
death by gas with the unmerited honor of
enslaved brains



having their cerebral organs installed in
brain-controls in the-

  williams heard no more the voice
ceased soon after and there was deathly
silence he vaguely comprehended that
everyone was looking at him and that
terry beside him had turned to stone
what were those words again some-
thing about death and brain-controls
death to die could that be their sen-
tence then the wall of resistance broke
down and the meaning flooded in to his
consciousness

  everyone in the court-room even the
scientists shuddered at the sudden harsh
aimless laugh that came from the older of
the two mens lips then he was led away
but at the door he jerked to a stop and
faced the still quiet court-room his
voice rang out for all to hear

  someday the unidum will be sorry it
ever permitted the inhuman brain-control
to become lawful

  there was a murmur from the crowd
and the scientists looked at one another
uneasily the judge reddened in anger
and seemed about to recall the case and
inflict a worse sentence but no worse sen-
tence could be thought of he waved for
them to take the prisoners out terry
had to be prodded several times before he
realized it was over

  escorted by a dozen unidum guards
they were taken upward by elevator and
brought before a different room than
they had had previous to the trial the
door clanged shut behind them and after
the grating of key in lock there was si-
lence williams had a queer look of de-
fiance on his face but his eyes were
dazed the dread sentence had struck
hard suddenly his face turned fierce

  my brain in a brain-control what
diabolical irony god if i had only suc-
ceeded in releasing helen then it would
be easier to take but just think terry
for ages the memory of having failed in
that will run through my dead-alive
brain   

  it was a ghastly thought and terry
shuddered

  but they havent executed its yet
williams went on vehemently and may
the seven devils of the seven hills of
ok-ok eat my heart out if i lose hope of
    escape

  terry thought the man had gone mad
for he began to prowl about the dark
cell as though looking for a secret door-
way he stopped at the real door with its
heavy bars and shook them experimental-
ly nothing could be solider the cell it-
self was steel-lined the one window had
heavy steel bars like the door throtigh
it could be seen the fairy-like picture of
boston at nighty but it was impossible to
see the street level sixty stories down
nearby the dark bulk of a huge enclosed
span jutted from the building extending
across the street canyon it carried elec-
tro-car service to the unidum sub-head-
quarters

  terry sat down with a feeling of pity
for the old man apparently the strain
had unsettled his mind perhaps he
thought he was back in africa impris-
oned in some rickety thatch hut that he
could batter down if he wished certainly
the look in his eyes was far from normal
and from his twitching lips came a mut-
tered stream of clipped african gibber-
ish that there was no escape terry
knew there were hundreds of unidum
police outside the door throughout the
building the doors lock could not be
picked for it had no key-hole on the in-
side the walls were proof against hu-
man strength and the one and only win-
dow let out upon a sheer drop of a thou-
sand feet

  when the crouching man sneaked cat-
footed to the window and cocked one ear
as though hearing something besides the
drone of aircraft above terry thought it
time to do something gently but firmly
he tugged him away from the window
avoiding the perplexed look in his eyes
and pushed him to the wall bunk wil-
liams struggled hesitantly and then fell
back flat he slept

  terry sighed heavily and threw himself
on his bunk the utter hopelessness and
despair of their situation crushed him

mercilessly they were in the steel claws
of the unidum whose justice was alloyed
only with mercilessness

         chapter viii
         mbopos plan

	hackworth spent the morning of the

  day terry and williams had gone to
boston writing a detailed report of the
north route to interior congo with
mbopo to clear up certain tricky points
in the geography of the land inhabited by
bantu tribes he had made a comprehen-
sive report which he planned sending to
the federated states of africa mbopo
displayed a degree of intelligence that
surprised the white man he traced unerr-
ingly the ramifications of the route along
unexplored rivers and through unnamed
deserts

  hackworth had undertaken the volun-
tary task more to keep his mind occupicd
than because of keen interest in the after-
noon he visited the hospital in which lila
lay asleep beyond the puzzled efforts of
the doctors to awaken her

  when terry and williams failed to ap-
pear at the evening meal he began to
worry yet what could have happened
alone williams might have done some-
thing rash but not with terry along the
double shock of hearing about the brain-
controls and hearing that his sisters
brain was in one of them had shaken
williams deeply hackworth knew that
was why he had insisted on the young
chemist accompanying him probably
taking in a few of the sights around
boston reflected hackworth

  at seven oclock he tuned in the radio-
news of the day uneasy and weighed
down ijy apprehension then his worst
suspicions were confirmed by the radio
as the announcer told of the hectic fight
in the brain-control room two men at-
tack scientist attempt to smash control
resist unidum guards finally subdued
aid jailed to be sentenced at the science
court

  for a while all hackworth could do
was ijin up and down the room aimlessly

then he fell to cursing his cousin curs-
ing terry and finally reviling the uni-
dum when mbopo stuck his head in the
doorway he poured out the story to him
in a mixture of bantu and english
mbopo stood as though frozen

 let us go to omo akku said
mbopo when hackworth had exhaust-
ed himself i will fight sarto brnf i will
kill all the guards and take my master
from prison

  no no said hackworth this is
not africa mbopo there are hundreds
of guards they would kill yon

  i do not care said the black man im-
passively take me to omo akku i wifl
fight for him

  hackworth suddenly realized that
mbopo was not asking but demanding
there had come a strange gleam in the
bantus eyes his primitive emotions
were arising even the super-civilization
of unitaria could not daunt him

  all right mbopo but not tonight
they would not let us in tomorrow
morning we will go

  mbopo grunted and sat himelf croas-
legged on the floor

  the next morning hackworth and the
black man were waiting in the foyer of
the unidum sub-headquarter in boston
till visiting hours began finally at nine
oclock they were led upward to the six-
tieth story

  the two prisoners were standing at the
window dejectedly looking out upon the
bustle of a large city they turned in sur-
prise when the door swung open

  hackworth cried terry how did
you find out about this so quickly 
heard about it over the radio last
night answered hackworth he faced
his cousin with deep reproach in his face
dan-

  yes i know interrupted williams
how could i be such a fool  i can hard-
ly explain it myself as i stood there
looking at the globe and realized that
helens  brain was in it something
just snapped in me

  hackworth nodded youre hardly to
be blamed he changed hi tone to a
enslaved brains



hesitant whisper how did the trial turn

out

  death and our brains to be used in
brain-controls

  great god in heaven gasped hack-
worth not that he sank limply to a
chair he seemed to have fainted except
that his eyes were open wide-and they
reflected a great horror

  terry did not have to tell hackworth
and lie had already told williams that the
execution would take place in three days
all sentences for treasonable crimes in
 were consummatedor started in
three days it was the policy of the uni-
dum to let no unnecessary delay hinder
the progress-of its iron justice

  lila lila what will happen to her
moaned hackworth suddenly with
terry gone she will never wake up
again

  yes she will returned williams
eventually the drug will lose its effect
but it might be years and she will
awaken only to find her lover gone and a
scientist-husband awaiting her

  the three men looked haggardly at
one another everything had now gone
awry even andrew grants help would
do no good for there would be no pur-
pose in freeing lila from the eugenics
law with terry dead

  we must simply -must try to do
something said hackworth suddenly
springing to his feet and pacing up and
down jail-breaking is impossible-

  terry and williams smiled wanly at
one another thinking of the previous eve-
ning when the latter in some mental
lapse had snooped around as though
planning an escape in the morning
awaking in full possession of his facul-
ties williams had seen clearly how im-
possible it was to flee their prison in any
way

  -but there are other things went on
hackworth his voice sank to a whisper
perhaps i can bribe the man with the
keys if not that i might approach higher
authority and let the sunlight flash on
gold ive got less than three days    
well ill do what i can

  but his tones were forlorn and uncon-
fident and terry gave no sign of interest
they both knew the unidum they both
knew how little hope there was for a
man condemned by the science court
and from their very tones and actions
williams knew too

  there was a strained silence mbopo
who had kept a respectful poise in the
corner suddenly confronted his master

  orno akku wishes to go free he
asked in bantu come mbopo will fight
for you we will kill the guards and fly
away in a metal bird

  no mbopo said williams smiling
despite the seriousness of the occasion
there are too many guards and they
have guns terry had described the
building they were in before hackworth
arrived it being the unidum sub-head-
quarters it literally swarmed with guards
who patrolled all the corridors and floors
to follow mbopos plan they would have
to fight their way through each set of
guards in turn before even reaching the
street level or some outlet even then a
clever alarm system would immediately
place armed police at all entrances and
exits of the building

  then i will stay here with you said
the black man promptly

  it took williams many minutes to con-
vince mbopo that his loyalty was mis-
placed under the circumstances and he
finished with a suggestion of tears in his
eyes at the black mans unselfish devotion

  then the guard at the door announced
that their time was up hackworth and
mbopo were forced to leave the forme
tried to say something cheerful as he
left but it was a dismal failure

  the public landing field and hangar at
which hackworth had left his sansrun
before entering the unidum building was
located on the flat top of a building but a
block away he had a choice of three
lanes by which to leave and by mere
chance took the one that passed the prison
side of the unidum building as the plane
took altitude they passed several rows of
windows heavily barred

  your master is in one of them said


wonder stories for august 

hackworth pointing in the general direc-
tion of the steel-barred windows

  mbopo strained his eyes to them al-
though it was two hundred yards away
he suddenly recognized williams face
peering out of one of them he excitedly
pointed it out to hackworth and the lat-
ter swung as close as the lane signals
would allow to wave a last goodbye then
he had to climb again up and up till they
were high above all buildings

  he felt a clutch on his arm words
poured into his ear-bantu words star-
tling words hackworth listened enrapt
he asked a few questions the replies
brought a thoughtful gleam to his eyes
he guided his sansrun along angled turns
that circled the unidum sub-headquar-
ters again they fell to the lowest lane on
the other side and climbed across the face
of the barred windows this time both
of them strained their eyes in the direc-
tion of the window which framed wil-
liams tanned face so absorbed was
hackworth in certain configurations that
he had to shoot his ship upward with a
jerk to avoid crashing into an enclosed
span

  then he sent the ship ayay from bos-
ton ah the way back to new york he
and mbopo talked excitedly could it be
done the black man claimed it could
perhaps he was right it was worth a
trial	  

  lying cn his bunk in a darkness broken
only by the dim light that came through
the window williams found it hard to
sleep the soft regular sound of terrys
breathing came to him except when the
drone of an airplane passing near filled
the little cell poor young terry all that
day he had been despondent and moody
the few times he had talked he had
talked only of lila about happy memo-
ries of the past clearly he had resigned
himself to fate williams asked himself
while tossing fitfully whether there was
any hope no hardly hackworth could
tk nothing even with his entire wealth
andrew grant could do nothing and
there was no one else to depend on for

help they were inevitably doomed first
the painless death then a rude awaken-
ing of some mystic sort with the gradual
realization of being a part of a compli-
cated apparatus forced to send nerve-
impulses along thin silver wires 

  williams perspired in a half-waking
nightmare he seemed to hear already the
clicking of magnet relays how relieved
to feel the hard bunk beneath him he
was not in a brain-control yet but the
clicking it was still there and a sibilant
sound  like rubbing

  he jerked his head erect the sound
came from the window there was some-
thing there with thought came action
he leaped from the bunk and toward the
window he stumbled over it-a rope at
its end was a small stone clicking as some
agency at the other end dragged it slowly
over the floor

  williams did not stop to ponder the in-
explicable presence of a rope but tied its
end to a bar giving it a final jerk to in-
dicate its being done in another moment
after several scraping sounds outside
mbopo appeared struggling violently
one of his hands gripped a bar then the
other with a suppressed grunt mbopo
contracted wiry arm muscles and pulled
his body upward till his knees rested on
the window ledge he rested in that posi-
tion panting

  mbopo how did you get here
what is this all about 

  orno akku gasped the black man
i come to rescue you the way i come
that way you go

  how did you come 

  i climb down long box that crosses
ditch i balance on rope i walk to end of
rope rope high as a man can reach i
jump here i am

  in a flash williams understood
mbopos enigmatical words of bantu
which could barely cover the subject
long box was span the nearby electro-
car enclosed span rope was cable sup-
port williams became excited then he
cursed

  but these bars mbopo
enslaved brains



  the black man silently probed in his
pockets and brought out a small bottle
which he handed through the bars

  you hurry omo akku hackwort
he waits

  and williams did hurry but not with
the nervous rapidity of a drowning man
clutching at a straw he had suddenly be-
come cool calm efficient with a cold
haste a hand on terrys shoulder a few
whispered words a quick series of deci-
sion and the young chemist became im-
bued with the same swift efficiency their
lives depended on how quickly they
worked

  williams crouched near the door plac-
ing his ear against it he waved to terry
the young chemist opened the bottle
poured out of it at the base of one of the
window bars there was a prolonged hiss
then the bar was loose from its mooring
completely eaten through another
drawn-out hiss and again a bar was loose
five bars were thus treated terry found
time to thank the gods that there was an
acid like that which attacked steel as vi-
ciously and quickly as sodium metal at-
tacks water williams at the door
watched the process with wonder he
knew there had never been a compound
like that in  but the results interest-
ed him far more when the final bar had
been severed by the acid he leaped noise-
lessly to the window a word to mbopo
and he grasped the first bar and pulled
outward terry held the black man by the
belt and williams helped bend the bar
with faint protest the steel gave and
curled upward with a frantic strength
they bent the other four

  now said williams panting comes
the hardest part that cable support tliat
leads to the span is about ten feet below
says mbopo we must hang by our hands
from the sill and climb down the rope to
the cable then we must walk along it to
the span its dangerous - one slip
and   

  terry shuddered in understanding it
was a thousand feet straight down

  lets go he said steadily

    williams motioned for him to go first
  and terry lost no time in clambering
  through the window his first glance at
  the view from his precarious perch on the
  sill brought a chill to his heart far below
  only partially revealed bylights was the
  ground level at various heights were
  both enclosed and platform spans hung
  with red lights all about were the cadav-
  erous heights of slim towers it was a diz-
  zying spectacle terry recovered his shak-
  en nerves twisted carefully about and
  lowered himself glad to feel the firm rope
  in his hands he descended hand over
  hand till his feet struck something solid
   and a strong hand steadied him mbopos
  round eyes peered into his

   in another moment williams came
 down the rope and all three of them stood
 crowded on the flat cable-lug that joined
 to the building a cool autumn breeze
 whistled around the wall and quickly took
 the perspiration off their brows 

    all right whispered williams i
  listened at the door just before i left
  through the window apparently none of
  the guards have heard a sound but the
  longer we hesitate the more chance we
  take mbopo unto ulka dis hell go first
  teriy then you do you think you can
  manage without help 

    terry watched the black man without
  answering the cable support for the
  nearby span stretched taut enclosing a
  triangle with the building and the span
  housing it was a hundred feet long and
  thick enough to give a solid footing
  mbopo arms outstretclied and slightly
  crouched to balance the gentle breeze ne-
  gotiated the cable without pause as sure-
  footed as a mountain goat his body
  gradually faded into the gloom at the
  side of the span

    i could hold your hand suggested
  williams or your bell-

    suddenly realizing that he must seem
  craven ki the older mans eyes for not
  having answered his question terry
  looked into his eyes

    i go   alone williams if i fail
  there is no need for you to fall with me

	williams gripped his hand encourag-
ingly and admiringly it was one thing
for mbopo and himself long trained in
africa in physical pursuits to traverse
the cable but quite another for a man
reared in civilization the latter does not
have that fine balance and muscular coor-
dination that a child of nature has nor
does he have that callousness toward dan-
ger that brings great courage

  nevertheless terry stepped away from
the cable-lug with set jaw determined to
do or die he took the first ten steps con-
fidently and began to feel that his first
fears were silly but at the next step a
gust of wind pushed at him off-balance
he blindly put his free foot forward and
only by sheerest luck touched the cable
with his toe back of him a voice called
encouragement it was no time to hesitate
and recover breath or nerve and terry
plunged recklessly forward barely able to
see the cable at his feet he steeled him-
self not to look past the support know-
ing that one glance at the pit under him
would paralyze his every muscle breath-
ing hard swaying and moving steadily
orward terry forgot everything but the
cable his feet and the wind it seemed
hours on end that he alternately lifted his
feet and set them down he dared not
look up nor to the side he wondered how
far he was god was this an eternal
nightmare  already he had tramped
miles his calve muscles ached as though
he had run a marathon he was getting
dizzy the constant stare of concentration
at the cable was bringing spots to his
eyes he was swaying the wind in
spiteful little gusts would 

  terry felt his front foot barely scrape
the cable it slipped and he knew it was
over suddenly limp and hopeless he felt
himself toppling  toppling into that
deep pit between buildings his body
would drop like a stone past five spans
down to the hard street nothing would
stop it  

  now what had happened wondered
terry something had grabbed his belt
something strained at his body hanging
over the pit with one foot only on the

cable and that something pulled him
back from the abyss

  terrys brain cleared mbopo was
there with a hand in his belt looking at
him in mute inquiry terry waved for-
ward again on balance one-two-three
steps and then terry felt the welcome
solidity of a broad flat surface they
were on the spans roof he had lost his
balance and almost fallen only three steps
from safety mbopo had saved his life
mbopo was grinning now and large beads
of sweat stood out on his brow only he
would ever realize how much super-
human agonizing strength it had taken to
pull the falling white man upright and at
the constant risk of losing his own bal-
ance should the torque shift too suddenly
from limp body to straining muscles

  there was a sound of running feet
and then a familiar voice as a figure
loomed up from farther along the spans
roof

  terry my boy thank god you made
it

  mr hackworth great to see you
again but how did you-

  explanations later must get away as
quickly as possible

  they turned to watch the dim figure
coming along the cable without hesita-
tion firmly and swiftly williams moved
along the cable there was an indefinable
grace about him and a boyish elasticity
that made it hard for terry to realize that
he was an old man in point of years cer-
tainly no younger man could do the feat
any easier

  williams came up with a rush waving
a jubilant arm

  all here safe and sound he hissed
nodding to hackworth no delay now
into the ship all of us

  as they ran toward the dark hulk of
hack worths sansrun they heard the
rumble of an electro-car beneath them
terry smiled little did the passengers
realize that on the roof under which they
streaked were four jail-breakers and an
outlaw ship how simple it had been after
all when but an hour before escape had
seemed absolutely impossible
enslaved brains



  williams closed the cabin door behind
them hackworth was already at the con-
trols but before starting the motors he
had them all look around for a possible
lurking police ship it was against the
law to land on a span detection would
bring immediate pursuit they looked
searchingly around high above from the
towers of the tallest buildings came the
broad sweeps of aircraft beacons ribbon-
ing the sky several of the important traf-
fic lanes were bathed in constant light re-
vealing a considerable night traffic where
they were beneath the lowest lane it was
a pocket of darkness between the lighted
streets and the swingng searchlights

  satisfied that no police ships were
around hackworth brought the twin
motors to life idled them for a minute
and then shot the ship upward they
climbed obliquely toward the neon-liglited
spire of a lane mark up and up out of
the canyon of spans suddenly there were
lane signals and hackworth obediently
leveled he breathed a sigh of relief

  the police danger is over now were
just one ship out of thousands

  he spoke too confidently however
had he but known it the pilot of a lum-
bering freighter passing the unidum sub-
headquarters on the way to a landing a
mile away had seen the shadowed ship
rise from the canyon suspicious as to
the motives of a private ship coming from
that forbidden direction he reported the
incident to the police after landing

  in the meantime hackworth piloted his
ship away from boston and headed in
the gloom of night to the south he built
up a fast but safe speed high above the
commercial lanes then he turned to his
cousin beside him

  dan youre a free man at least for
a while

  thanks to you earl you are-
thanks to mbopo interrupted
hackworth it was his idea passing the
prison side of the unidum sub-headquar-
ters he saw that your window was within
reach of the cable support from that
sixth level span at first i thought it
hare-brained then i saw how easy it

would be to land the sansrun on the
span roof in the night as for the rest
mbopo claimed it would be just as easy
and so it proved

  williams struck his head deprecatingly
and to think it escaped me entirely that
idea mbopo unlettered native as we like
to call him has scored against the ati-
powerful unidum its a curious thought
well- he changed his tone-the im-
portant thing is now where to go 
ive figured that out already re-
turned hackworth you and terry at
present are outlaws there will be a price
on your heads a peaceful life in uni-
taria is impossible the thing for you
both to do is get away and live in regions
not governed by the unidum

 never came vehemently from
terry not while lila is alive i live with
her or die with her i could never forge
her-

  let me finish terry said hack-
worth quietly my plan is to negotiate
your escape from unitaria along with
lila and furthermore after i myself
have carefully had my money transferred
to foreign accounts i will join you we
can all live a happy life in some sheltered
corner of earth free of the unidum
hack worths eyes shone as he went on
the plan in detail is this-i am taking
you to the long island tidc-station
whose superintendent is a close friend of
mine i have already spoken to him he
is to be trusted a tide-station is the
ideal place for you two to hide because
of its position right on the ocean and
because the police will never think of you
being there once safely hidden you wilt
simply lie low and i will do my part
charter a stratosphere ship and somehow
get lila from the hospital andrew grant
will help me do that then-

  an exclamation from terry cut him
off

  look a ship is pursuing us

  they peered backward through the
rear-vision mirror with ominous pur-
posefulness a long slim tri-motored plane
hung on their trail rapidly gaining it
could not be mere chance that it followed

them they were both out of the regular
lanes

  god cried hackworth weakly its
a unidum police ship i can tell by its
shape

chapter ix
the tide-stotion

	the three white men looked aghast at
one another hackworth became sud-
denly enervated his eyes reflected hope-
lessness terry peered again into the mir-
ror and confirmed the statement

  that stops us said hackworth wea-
rily its possible they merely wonder
why we fly so high and fast but if they
make us land and question us the whole
thing is spoiled

  but williams was not so willing to
admit defeat

  how long yet before we reach the
tide-station

  about twenty minutes at top speed
rut theres no use trying to otrtfly them
dan they are much faster besides
theyre armed if we try to escape theyll
disable us not only that in a few minutes
there will be more police ships here-
and heres the stop-and-land sig-
nal  burst in terry

  from the pursuing ship had -flashed a
thin beam of crimson light flooding the
cabin with reflected red

  if we disobey-

  stop-and-land be damned cried
williams grasping hackworth by the
arm with compelling fingers its dark
isnt it turn off the cahfn lights and
drop maneuver around-throw em off
the track why should we give up so
tamely when weve gone to the trouble
of breaking jail 

  hackworth hesitated and terry firmly
motioned him away from the controls

  williams is right ill give them a run-
around 

  plunged in darkness terry manipulat-
ed the controls and shot the ship down
leveling gradually he swung in a huge
arc that would take them away from the
police ship from the latter now shot
several brilliant beams of white light

winch probed through the darkness
searching for the vanishing prey for a
moment it looked as though they would
escape entirely

  then terr cursed to one side ap-
peared more beams of dancing light a
maze of them some of the rays almost
touched them and only a quick drop or
swerve prevented it

  theyve got the whole boston patrol
after us gasped hackworth they
must know we are the ones who broke
jail with the direct radio contact they
have theyll hem us in gradually-

  not if i can help it muttered terry
grimly

  williams encouraged him with hopeful
words and their ship became a plunging
weaving thing trying to escape the inex-
orable beams of dozens of police ships
it looked hke a dance of the fireflies
every so often the fleeing ship would
flicker in the chance beam of a light and
the police ships would converge like
hungry vultures

  if i only had more speed groaned
the perspiring terry this way i cant
draw away i can only dodge up and
down

  no good terry said williams who
had quietly watched the maneuvers
theyre gradually cutting us off on all
sides can you give them a run as far as
the tide-station without getting in range
of their weapons

  possible if we rise at full power you
see as a helicopter were their equal be-
cause they only have two adaptable en-
gines we might get as far as the tide-
station with a good start but a lot of
good that will do

  try it said williams in command-
ing tones

  willing to try anything under the cir-
cumstances terry jammed his foot on
the throttle and swung the air-screws up-
ward the beams of the police ships fell
below for many long seconds then again
followed as flicker after flicker revealed
the outlaw ship rising but before they
gained sufficient altitude to head the flee-
ing ship off terry had swung level at full
enslaved brains



speed he flew over a police ship from
which came a sudden scarlet flash

  missed breathed terry trembling
and they wont get another chance for
some time

  ten mimvtes of ear-shattering flight
with the police gaining rapidly brought
them within sight of the tide-station at
the tip of long island williams stared
in interest as it swiftly crawled toward
them from the horizon it was an incred-
ible affair more alien to  than even
the queer hyp-marine long stiff con-
crete appendages reached out to sea for
miles all dimly visible in reflected light
they all radiated from a comparatively
small building flat and unadorned in the
exact center of its circular flat roof was
a small brightly-lit bubble which was the
control room for the entire station all
the enormous electrical energy produced
by the tides at that point was wired to
cities as far north as boston and as far
south down the coast as new york

  but the immensity of the thing dis-
tracted williams from the affairs of the
moment only for an instant he knew
one important thing about the tide-station
upon which he had built a plan which
offered a slim hope of once again escap-
ing the unidum at his order terry shot
the plane downward braked with the
helicopters at a dragging angle and land-
ed on the flat roof

  no time to talk said williams hur-
riedly as hackworth looked inquiringly
at him lead the way to your friend the
superintendent

  even as the four of them raced across
the roof toward a lighted alcove from
which steps led downward one of the
police ships descended with roaring
motors at the foot of the stairs a figure
met them panting

  hackworth he cried youve ruined
me i saw-the police-

  weve ruined nothing yet cried wil-
liams listen to me    

  in terse sentences he unfolded his plan
joe manners the superintendent of the
tide-station nodded and led the way along
a corridor and then up steps they

  emerged in a room of small size whose
ceiling was hemispherical it contained
nothing more than a desk and chair and
a panel of several dials and switches but
inconspicuous as it seemed it was the
master control-room of the station from
below vibrating through the walls came
the hum of the giant tide-generators

  manners closed the door they had en-
tered and locked it after a momentary
glance at the dial readings he turned to
the others

  the plan will work only it we prop-
erly strike fear into their hearts

  but will there be any trouble for
you afterward asked hackworth

  i think not little is known of the
technicalities of a tide-station to the
average person like the police i will be
able to lie out of it and stave off sus-
picion as for the chances i take i have
good reasons of my own for wishing to
help you in this predicament you see-

  a loud knocking at the door cut him
off he signalled caution to the others

  open for the unidum police came
in loud tones from the other side of the
door

  i-i cant shouted back manners
with well-simulated fear in his voice i
am in the hands of desperate men who-

  he bit off his words and choked as
though threatened by dire threats from
the other side of the door the conspirators
heard a jumbled murmur then again a
voice

  those men two of them at least are
criminals sentenced to death for treason
they broke prison in boston they
are-

 oh oh oh moaned manners in
mock tribulation what will i do i have
nothing to do with this-

 shut up shouted williams with
well-timed ferocity he winked to the
others and held up a warning finger they
would see wliat the police had to say
next

  hey you in there came from the
minions of the law beyond the door
surrender yourselves or it will go hard
with you


wonder stories for august 

  damn you never shouted back wil-
liams with a tone of voice that was meant
to convey desperate recklessness rather
than go back prisoners to certain death
we will wreck this tide-station and die in
its ruins

  as he finished manners pulled a little
switch which sent a crackling spark across
two fuse electrodcs then he raised his
voice to shouts of alarm stamped his
feet on the floor and signalled for the
others to do likewise

  dont touch that switch he cried
gasping

  the police seeing none of this but
hearing the noises of a scuffle which
sounded ominous threw their weight
against the door and attempted to batter
it down but the door held

  you dont know what youre doing
youll blow up-

  get out of my way-

  youre mad to try-help

  no help for you nor for the police
who want to capture us nor for any-
body   

  all these jumbled words delivered with
hoarse shouts along with scuffling noises
struck a nameless fear into the hearts of
the police the desperadoes inside the
control room were tampering with elec-
tric dynamite thousands of kilowatts of
it

  then came manners voice again in a
piercing scream

  the master switch-he pulled it-
let me out of here-the whole station will
blow up-fools youve got just ten sec-
onds to live   

  the police hearing this dreadful state-
ment stampeded away from the door like
frightened rats if the station was doomed
to crash in ruin no need for them to lose
their lives along with the insane criminals
who had unleashed the titantic power

  when the noise of running feet died
away beyond the door the men in the
little control room ceased stamping their
feet and slapping their arms and grinned
at one another

  it worked chuckled manners then
he became serious

  now youve got your chance go to
your ship-fly away in the dark-ill turn
out every light in the station-but hurry
because theyll throw some searchlights
down here when they get high enough
before they do that you cantake-off in
all the confusion and quietly slip away
when they come to investigate ill tell
them i saved the station just in time and
that you criminals escaped-how or
where i wont say hurry go

  as they left the room cautiously peer-
ing down the corridor in case any of the
police had called the bluff there came the
roar of the police ships taking-off

  no worry about them cried wil-
liams theyre intent on saving their
own precious necks

  just as they reached the flat roof every
light went out manners had been true to
his word and had timed it exactly right
under cover of darkness they ran to
their ship safe in the knowledge that the
police would not know till too late that
their prey had escaped by a ruse

  hackworth in the lead jumped in he
waited impatiently for the others to join
him but to his surprise he heard wil-
liams voice

  start the motors earl and go get
away from here as fast as you can and
head for home-and safety

  what spluttered hackworth and
you  and terry

  well take care of ourselves you go
-no one as yet knows youre connected
with this besides even if we went with
you sooner or later wed have to sep-
arate as outlaws weve got to escape
unitaria and we can do that without
you

  but dan-

  go if only for lilas sake and hurry
hackworth any moment the air-police
will smell a rat and put a searchlight

down here

	overwhelmed by these arguments
hackworth shouted a goodbye
roared the motors to life and took the
ship up and away to him it seemed a
madmans move but to have argued with
enslaved brains



his strong-headed cousin would have been
futile hardly had he drawn safely away
from the tide-station than hovering police
ships already suspicious that the threat-
ened catastrophe had not occurred cast
their light beams downward they re-
vealed a deserted landing roof the beams
began to swing about frantically but
hackworth was already beyond their
effective range he at least had escaped
from this nights hectic mixup with the
unidum police but how would his
friends fare

  by the time the police had recovered
their courage and swung searchlights on
the roof-top williams terry and
mbopo were again in the control room
facing a startled man manners threw his
flashlight beam to each of their faces

  the devil take you  he cried why
are you back you will get me in trouble
now if the police find me with you
ive changed my plans said williams
calmly staying with hackworth would
have been dangerous not only for us but
for him

  good lord cried manners shrilly
you dont think about me at all i
helped you all i could stalled off the
police at great personal risk and now
you want me to hide you with the con-
stant fear of-

  were not going to stay manners
cut in williams sharply listen to me
ive heard that iceland is an independent
island where fugitives from the unidum
can safely hide to stay in unitaria any
longer is dangerous for terry and my-
self if we can get to iceland from
here   

  this is just the worst place to be
for that cried manners you cant get
aboard any type of transportation from
this tide-station the nearest dock is at
long island city

  but you have planes here dont you
your employees-

whatever williams had in mind was
never uttered for the sudden harsh
drone of laboring engines outside in-
formed them that the police had returned
manners stared at them in speechless

misery they would all be caught to-
gether  there could be no second ruse for
the police would be wiser from the first
one

  come on terry called williams
racing to the door i sec now it was a
mistake not going with hackworth but
still we can give the police a run-around
they became reckless then intent only
on delaying capture as long as possible
it was senseless to think of going to the
landing roof already they could hear
the murmurs and footsteps of approach-
ing unidum guards williams dashed
down a corridor that led oceanward away
from the control-room terry and mbopo
at his heels there were shouts behind
them the corridor opened into a long
and curving chamber from the opposite
wall off which led straight passageways

  this way said terry suddenly run-
ning down the hall theres a possible
chance-

  at one of the long passageways whose
end seemed lost in distance as though it
stretched onward forever he stopped and
pointed at what seemed a miniature train

  this is the tide-stations transporta-
tion system-propelled like an electro-
car-with which workmen go to the dif-
ferent parts of these long tide-power
piers which are sometimes five miles
long i can run it-just one lever to start
and stop it

  where does it lead to

  well-nowhere out into the ocean
terry shrugged everything was now
purposeless there was no escape-only
delay

  come on said williams in sudden
decision well take a ride in it perhaps
somewhere we can hide along that five-
mile stretch and   

  there was nothing more to say any-
thing they did now was aimless there
could be but one ending to the whole
affair-eventual capture they were
merely fleeing because it was against
their nature to surrender their persons
meekly

  terry pulled the lever savagely when
they were all seated in the vehicle with


wonder stories for august 

but a faint hum of magnetic motors it
started gathering speed swiftly almost
noiseless on its rubber-covered wheels
but the enormously-long cavern became
resonant with the echoes that rolled back
from the farther end

  the train ran on a ledge fastened to
one wall of the tide-pier not twenty feet
below was the surface of the ocean swell-
ing toward high tide creeping upward
inch by inch at high tide tremendous
shutters would clip across the tide-pier
dozens of feet down the receding ocean
level would then leave a titanic mass of
water captured in man-made reservoirs
possessing terrific potential energy how
the weight of falling water was converted
into kinetic energy williams could not
see nor did he care at the time his mind
was seething with plans and plans-how
to get out of this predicament he had
let one good chance slip by-refusing to
go with hackworth would another
chance somehow present itself

  when the vehicle came to a stop before
the end of the tide-pier which was set
with windows they looked at one another
in dismay down the long hallway came
the sound of another train

  the police said terry emotionlessly
are right on our heels i suppose man-
ners to save his own reputation had to
give us away

  he became suddenly vehement eyes
flashing were trapped williams
weve got a choice of two things cap-
ture and the brain-control death or-

  he pointed to the still black water on
the other side of the ledge-railing it
would be a quick and merciful death at
least preferable to  he shuddered
their brains their dead brains 
they would fish out the bodies and take
out the brain organs and 

  dont you see screamed terry sud-
denly even that way the unidum will
carry out its sentence  brain-con-
trols  there is no escape there
was no escape from the beginning wil-
liams we-

  terry felt a hand shaking him by the
shoulder a strong hand there was a

voice too an imperative voice asking him
something the agonizing grip of terror
loosened the young chemists mind and
he heard

   terry what are those lights out there
beyond the tide-pier

  lights terrj looked moored sea-
planes-private craft mainly

  terry can you swim that far

   whether  can or not ill try it an-
swered terry thinking of the oncoming
police

  in a flash they were imbued with new
courage the black of despair had turned
to a gray dawn of hope they stripped to
the skin and threw the clothes over the
railing into the water mbopo went first
through an opened window terry poised
a moment before diving shivering be-
fore williams joined them he looked
down the passageway he smiled in satis-
faction  the police were still too far away
to be distinguished in the gloom and con-
versely they could not have seen what
their quarry had done he closed the
window hanging by tooth and nail on the
sill let them think the prisoners liad
drowned themselves inside then he dove
downward

  he came up gasping in the cold water
calling softly to his companions he
struck out for the brightest of the lights
which danced on the choppy water far
out in the gloom

  take it easy warned williams
conserve your strength it looks like a
long swim

  terry gasped a reply and changed to
a smooth side-stroke williants drew
back of him and uttered a few dialect
phrases to mbopo the black man glid-
ing along easily obediently crawled to
the side of the young chemist and let him
set the pace that this would be a test of
stamina williams knew and that terry
would be the first to weaken lie knew
also as for himself and mbopo their
tireless bodies jungle-trained would
stand terrific punishment

  hand over hand breath after breath
they fought the ocean with its shoreward
tow and chilling bite choppy waves
enslaved brains



seemed spitefully intent on choking them
and pushing them under it was an or-
deal to test any man of strength and the
bobbing lights ahead seemed to dance
ever farther away

  it might have been an hour later-or
a year for all they knew--that terry
spluttered violently and stopped

  i cant go on he gasped between
clenched teeth and blue lips goodbye
  im done maybe you can 
make it   

  as though it were a signal williams
and mbopo swam to either side of him

  here terry  one hand too each
 of our shoulders look were al-
most there

  terry wondered if it could be true he
had not the strength to raise his head and
look he held on to their shoulders grim-
ly incredulous that they still had the
spirit to go on when he was completely
fagged under his aching fingers he could
feel the rippling of powerful shoulder
muscles could they go on much longer 

chapter x
a chance friend

	ages later terry felt a change in the
motion of the swimmers at his side
a voice that seemed miles away spoke

  sarto gasped williams weve
reached something

  the words startled terry he had for-
gotten that they had been swimming to
a destination he shook off his numbed
lethargy and raised eyes that smarted
from the salt water

  the sea-plane dock he mumbled as
clearly as he could climb up   and
rest even as he said it he wondered
how it would be accomplished for the
floating docks level was three feet above
he heard splashing and saw mbopo
leaping out of the water with frightful
contortions in the attempt to catch the
dock edge finally he made it with a
spasmodic jerk that must have taken
super-human effort he pulled himself up
and rolled over onto the dock

  in another moment with the help of

mbopo reaching down the two white
men rolled onto the wooden surface for
five long minutes only stertorous breath-
ing and spasmodic shivers occupied them
as they lay flat regaining their sadly
taxed energy

  the dock they were on was in reality a
giant raft anchored securely cut into
its edges were spaces long and broad
enough to admit the pontoons of sea-
craft it was a public service for those
who owned sea-planes and wished to
moor them temporarily each of them
twinkled with red lights at the wing tips

  williams was the first to stagger erect
he pulled terry to his feet and made him
jump around violently to circulate slug-
gish blood mbopo joined them the ex-
ercise helped greatly to revive them even
though the cool night breeze now threat-
ened to freeze them by the process of
evaporation

  lets go said williams controlling
chattering teeth with great effort must
get a ship  invade it   fight
for it mbopo- he finished with dia-
lect that brought a -gleam to the black
mans eyes

  in the deep gloom that lay over the en-
tire floating dock they made their way
toward a tri-motored craft a hundred
yards away

  as they walked terry licked stiffened
lips and worked tightened jaws

  williams listen to me he finally
said theyre moored with two ropes
from pontoon-stays to dock-posts must
loosen them

  williams nodded but first we storm
the cabin

  he cursed when they reached the first
plane its cabin was dark and the doors
locked they went to the next and it too
was empty and locked at the third there
was a light from inside and the sound of
many voices

  mbopo looked inquiringly at his mas-
ter but the latter shook his head a dozen
or so men were more than they could
handle

  the fourth was a small ship twin-
motored


wonder stories for august 

  here we go said williams id
rather fight than freeze

  he jerked open the cabin door and
plunged in terry crowding in after
mbopo expected to hear shouts and
cries but all he heard was a muffled gasp
and a crack of fist on flesh then he saw
williams face grinning back at him

  only one man he said and i took
care of him now to warm up

  the cabin comfortably heated seemed
like bliss after the freezing they had
undergone for a long while they all
relaxed in wordless ecstasy crumpled on
the floor was a man whose upturned face
still had a look of stunned surprise on it

  the warmth gradually soaked through
their blue skins and loosened their
tongues

  you can fly this asked williams

  i think so controls look very similar
to land-craft

  we must go as soon as possible
unitaria is no place for us at present i
know- williams added at the frown
on terrys face-that you are thinking
of lila and hate to leave for that reason
but we would be courting capture around
here we can hide safely in iceland as
for what to do about lila first we must
wait till we hear from andrew grant if
he cant get her release were going to
do our best to get lila spirited away to
iceland that was why i wanted hack-
worth to get away so that he can plan
on that so far all has gone well
enough-

  he stopped short at a sudden sound of
laboring airplane motors which he knew
only too well meant a ship landing terry
peering out on the long stretch of dock
turned with dismay in his face

  a police ship

  williams sprang to look and saw a
striped ship bouncing to a stop near a
housing whose windows shone with in-
terior lights five uniformed figures
leaped from the cabin of the plane and
banged on the door of the housing the
lone attendant of the seaplane mooring
came out and they engaged in gesticulat-
ing conversation

  then the police are not so simple
muttered williams half to himself they
have come here on the chance that we did
attempt this swim and succeeded

  we should have suspected they
would said terry the unidum guards
are noted for their efficiency i wonder
just what theyll do

  williams was staring out to see he
saw the police leave the vicinity of the
housing and head rapidly for the first of
the moored craft followed by the attend-
ant they disappeared in the shadows of
the ship but emerged a moment later to
walk toward the next plane

  damn breathed terry who had
watched this over his companions shoul-
der theyre looking in each ship theyll
find us i weve got to hide

  no use said williams quickly not
enough time and no place that i can see
anyway

  the rear supply hold-but no it
wont hold all of us williams weve got
to do something-

  and we will do something terry
start up the motors be ready for instant
tace-off mbopo and i will loose the
moor-ropes

  but man theyll hear the engine
noise and dash over with their light-
ning pistols you two dont stand a
chance-

  got to fight for it terry only hope
left you start the motors and leave the
rest to us if you hear me shout give
her the gun he shot clipped bantu
phrases to the black man in the same
staccato voice

  terry opened his mouth to remonstrate
but they were gone for a moment he
thought of leaping out to help them then
decided to follow williams instructions
williams had seemed to have a peculiar
knack for thinking of workable plans on
the spur of the moment perhaps again
luck would be with them terry grasped
the starter switch and closed it with a
coughing roar the twin motors hurled
their powerful voice across the water

  even before terry had done this wil-
liams and mbopo had unhooked the
enslaved brains



mooring ropes from the pontoons at the
formers low-voiced command the black
man raced around the back of the ship
to where his master was and together
they crouched in the deep shadow of the
planes one wing nearest the group of
police they waited eyes on the uni-
formed guards like panthers at a zebra
watering spa for a moment williams
was transported back in time twenty
years when he anti a brawny black had
ambushed a party of marauders under
the shadow of a huge tree and fallen
upon their backs with such fury as to
completely rout them

  at the unexpected roar of the motors
the police had whirled in surprise light-
ning-pistols in hand at a shout from
their leader they sprang forward in-
tent on capturing the outlaws before the
motors were sufficiently warmed to start
they saw nothing as they raced past one
wing to get at the cabin door the first
thing they knew two naked figures one
white and one black had leaped among
them hard fists flying

  the onslaught laid two of the guards
flat and senseless the other three flung
about with pistols upraised to meet a
storm of blows one pistol flashed harm-
lessly into the night air and user crashed
against the wing a second later his last
impression was the shuddery one of a
demoniacal black face leering at him
the remaining two guards knocked off
their feet bounced up again but neither
was armed the weaponshad flown out
of their hands skilled in boxing they
held their own against the attackers wil-
liams and mbopo began to take jolting
punishment out of the corner of his eye
williams saw the attendant who had been
hanging back run and stoop for one of
the dropped lightning-pistols if he should
get it and 

  it was time for super-action with a
savage grunt williams lowered his head
and unmindful of a stunning rabbit
punch from his antagonist grasped him
about the thighs in a bear hug and heaved
mightily with a half-whirl of his body
he flung the helpless guard away from

him in the direction of the attendant just
as the latter fired the policeman sagged
paralyzed taking the full charge and
before the pistol spoke again williams
had bounded over him and bowled over
the attendant with a terrific blow to the
chest

	he whirled to see mbopo arising from
where he had just squeezed the breath
out of his adversary with scissored legs
and strong fingers

 ulak gnol he grinned any
more 

  terry sitting at the controls in appre-
hension unable to hear a sound above
the engine noise heaved a sigh of re-
lief as the somewhat battered faces of
his two companions appeared at the cabin
door

  lets go shouted williams before
some more police ships come up

  terry pulled the ship gently along till
the edge of the dock appeared and then
opened the throttle in another minute
they were off the water and rising rapidly
williams looked back and down at the
dwindling dock and then at the huge
tide-station on whose flat roof were
numerous dots-the rest of the unidum
fleet he laughed suddenly with animal
joy

  weve given them something to think
about he said above the engine noise
which had become a steady drone he
laughed again and the other two joined
him it was the reaction to the excite-
ment of the past hour

  now to be serious said williams
finally when their laughter had died can
you find your way to iceland

  ill have to guess at it admitted
terr but well find it theres plenty
of fuel-enough to go to europe im
not worrying about ourselves were safe
now but i wish i could be sure hack-
worth got away safely

  beyond a doubt said williams con-
fidently with no excess weight in the
ship he must have been able to make a
speedy get-away

  he shook his fist in the direction of


wonder stories for august 

new york in a sudden reversal of
thought brain-controls eh make us
victims of the most inhuman thing ever
seen on the face of earth not while i-
he broke off and turned his head in
the corner of his eyes he had seen the
former occupant of the plane stir he
now saw the fellow rubbing a tender jaw
and sit up

  williams watched him curiously won-
dering what he would say he seemed
about middle-age sturdy of body and
possessed of a pair of remarkably pene-
trating dark eyes those eyes now
gleamed at williams with dazed per-
plexity

  i seem to have acquired a voluntary
pilot said the man in a slow drawling
voice

  yes and two voluntary passengers
returned williams grimly for your
benefit we are heading for iceland we
mean you no harm at our destination
we will give you back this ship

  you are fleeing from the law quer-
ied the other raising himself to one of
the side seats

  which is no business of yours
and you were sentenced to death and
the brain-control  asked the man calmly

  williams started you heard us-
well as long as you know what differ-
ence does it make

  perhaps a lot was the enigmatic
reply after you get to iceland what
then 

  dont tell him warned terry sud-
denly he might cause trouble with
that information

  williams scowled whoever you are
youve got too much unhealthy curiosity
just sit down and keep still with that
he turned away and looked to the east
the first flushes of dawn liad changed the
ocean to a sea of blood to one side was
the indistinct silhouette of an ocean liner
seemingly mired in the vast bosom of
the sea

  williams suddenly whirled hold on
there what are you tip to

  the man having arisen and taken a
step toward the rear halted and turned

with surprise why you need some
clothes dont you

  we do retorted williams but i
think-

  watch ham came from terry he
might have a gun back there in the
supply room

  just a minute said the man as wil-
liams advanced threateningly weve got
some things to talk over i think ive
been trying to think just what to do for
the past few minutes but now ive de-
cided i may be taking a chance with you
three but briefly would you join an or-
ganization that will allow you to strike
back at the unidum 

  williams stared a moment speechless
what organization and just who are
you 

  john agarth is my name began
the man leaning toward terry so that he
could hear and motioning for williams to
come nearer about a year ago a group
of men met in a small city of europe and
pledged themselves to a certain cause
to end the menace of the brain-control m

  go on said williams breathlessly
you can trust us-

  i do trust you continued agarth i
seem to sense in you three a certain dar-
ing spirit which is what we want in our
members to go on the brain-control
aside from its hideousness is a distinct
menace to humanity whether or not the
unidum realizes that it must be wiped
out to that purpose is our organization
pledged our membership although large
already can still use men of spirit and
daring what is your answer

  for my part said williams quickly
count me in and that includes my man
here mbopo you terry-

  terry was silent in thought for a mo-
ment as an outlaw in the eyes of the
unidum it would be unreasonable to re-
fuse but i reserve the right to pursue my
own affairs if occasion arises

  quite all right assured agarth
now heres wliat i have to offer in re-
turn for your co-operation immunity
from the law in secret hiding places and
the opportunity of working toward your
inslaved brains



own salvation if our plans go through
the unidum decree which now demands
your life will be null and void then
there will lie the spice of adventure-
which is most acceptable said wil-
liams

  and for assurance that i am not de-
ceiving you continued agarth look at
this

  he pulled a folded paper from inside
his coat it was a printed unidum crim-
inal notice that john agarth as described
was an outlaw at large

  you see he explained at their sur-
prise i once was sentenced to die as
you were and to have the honor of sub-
mitting my brain to a brain-control in
the early days of our organization we
were over-zealous and made an abortive
attempt to smash brain-controts several
of our members- his voice rang bitter-
were executed the rest of us were res-
cued in a bloody jailbreak from then
on we planned more secretly and cun-
ningly we call ourselves the brothers
of humanity  will explain more in de-
tail some other time at present i think
you men had better indulge in sleep i
can see you are weary ill take the con-
trols

  as he replaced terry in the pilot seat
he rubbed his sore jaw ruefully i can
say one thing williams you gave me
the surprise of my life back there at the
floating dock i was waiting tor a secret
word-of-mouth message from new york
little did i expect a naked man to
suddenly jump at me and knock me out
of course under the circumstances
you understand-

  perfectly assured agarth and as
for the message it will get to me even-
tually with a little immaterial delay i
was really there more in the spirit of ad-
venture hanging right under the uni-
durns nose so to speak than because of
necessity

  they felt the ship swerve instead of
iceland were going to our headquarters
m paris explained agarth it is secret
and perfectly safe

  terry was already fast asleep on the
floor williams before he too succumbed
found a moment to revel inwardly in the
thought of a pleasing future what kind
fate had saved him from the unidum and
brought him within reach of the oppor-
tunity to strike back how would it all
turn out what to do about lila unan-
swerable questions they were that put
him to sleep beside him lay faithful
mbopo more worn and battered than
any of them content that omo akku
was still alive and free

chapter xi

through the stratosphere

	i have both good and bad news for
you said john agarth coming upon
williams and terry conversing together
in a room of the secret headquarters of
the brothers of humanity in paris

 from hackworth queried terry
eagerly

  agarth nodded and handed him a sheet
of paper i got in touch with him
through our secret communication chan-
nels the message was in code but i have
had it decoded for you to read

  terry read it aloud to williams the
gist of the missive was that hackworth
had made a clean escape from the police
at the tide-station that lila was still
peacefully asleep to the exasperation of
her doctors and that andrew grant had
admitted his absolute inability to get
lilas release from the eugenics law at
the end of the message hackworth want-
ed to know-already knowing that they
were safe from capture-what williams
and terry planned to do next

  i dont think theres any dobut about
what we plan to do said williams
hunted outlaws as we are we will work
toward the goal of the brothers of hu-
manity as long as lila is safe from her
pre-ordered fate you terry can feel
free to help in the great cause lets see
now  lila has been in a coma for
ten days for ten days the unidunvs best
medical men have puzzled over her case
and failed to awaken her that is indica-


wonder stories for august 

tion enough i think tliat the drug is
beyond their knowledge and remedy
and only i half whispered terry
only i can awakenher he looked up
at agarth with shining eyes i hereby
pledge myself as a member o-f the
brothers of humanity

  good said agarth you will be duly
installed in our records and i have a
little surprise instead of merely becom-
ing one of our many members without
authority each of you will be invested
with the authority of what we call mar-
shal as ive mentioned before the
brothers of humanity has an orderly
semi-military foundation at the head are
the two generals next in authority are
five majors of which i am one then
come the marshals at present ten in num-
ber  then come captains lieutenants
and finally the brothers

  but why should terry and myself get
such a distinction as marshalship  asked
williams perplexed weve just joined
the brothers of humanity and so far
havent done a thing in fact up till now
weve been just a lot of worry and ex-
pense to you agarth

  but you have done something con-
tradicted agarth smiling he turned seri-
ous suddenly let me explain you have
been instrumental whether wittingly or
not in gaining two important members
to our organization i refer to andrew
grant and joe manners

  williams and terry gasped aloud
they are now brothers 

  yes through you you see for some
time our agents who are constantly try-
ing to enlist influencial men in our
brotherhood had been surreptitiously ap-
proaching both those men yet not till
yesterday did either of them actually
yield grant because terrys poignant
plight had touched his heart manners be-
cause he suddenly saw how cruel the
unidum was in sentencing you two to
death and worse both grant and man-
ners are important additions to our
brotherhood especially the latter who
controls the life-current that pours into
new york

  manners is in no trouble because of
us is he asked williams

  no i have already ascertained that
although there was suspicion and pres-
sure against him at first the unidum
finally took his word for it that he had
nothing to do with the escape of three
vicious criminals namely yourselves

  agarth turned to the door excuse
me i must attend to some important busi-
ness ill be back to have dinner with
you

  when agarth had left williams turned
to terry i cant begin to tell you how
glad i am that events led to this terry
from the moment i heard that my sis-
ters  brain  was in a brain-
control i felt i could never know a mo-
ment of peace till i had done what i could
to end the purgatory in which she must
live and those hundreds of other brains f
-its ghastly some kind fate has pre-
served me and made it possible to hdp
end the enslavement of the brains to
that i now dedicate my every effort and
if need be my life

  and i too said terry i find it hard
to understand now how i not ten days
ago resigned myself so abjectly to the
course of tilings for years the thought
of the brain-control in branch e where
i worked had bothered me then when
the great blow fell and lila was tom away
from me by the eugenics law i seemed
to break like a dried reed only when you
williams there at the hyp-marine dock
unfolded a plan to save lila did i awaken
from that mental lethargy now i see how
mouse-couraged i was and now i am
determined as are all the brothers-and
as every soul in unitaria should be-to
do my part in this crusade to end wrong

  it was three days after the episode in
the tide-station that these conversations
took place while terry and williams
and the faithful mbopo had slept weary
and bruised agarth had flown across the
atlantic toward europe landing in a
hidden bay on the shores of southern
france which was a state of unitaria
roughly corresponding to the france of
pre-unidum times they had been driven
enslaved brains



to paris by agents of the brotherhood in
an automobile speeding along the super-
highways at two hundred miles an hour

  the new paris with its spanned tow-
ers and spires and comfortable residences
had shifted a few miles northward leav-
ing the old squalid and dirty city deserted
and falling to ruin this old section had
been completely surrounded by a ring of
underground strongholds forty years be-
fore when a hitlerized germany had
threatened to once again march on
paris they were camouflaged from
above entered by means of narrow tun-
nels whoso mouths were concealed by
bushy trees and hedges in one of these
the brotherhood had set up a headquar-
ters unmolested and unsuspected by the
unidum the underground chambers
were roomy and well-ventilated and af-
forded an ideal habitation for such utter
secrecy as the brotherhood needed

  from this headquarters agarth and
his agents had for months been gradual-
ly spreading the invisible web of the
brotherhood over all of european unt-
taria working hand in hand with four
other centralized units in the continent
the superior headquarters of the broth-
erhood where the two generals of the
organization guided the whole movement
was located near san francisco on the
western coast of america the brother-
hood had its main strength concentrated
in that part of america west of the
rockies where it was rumored the people
had always been bitterly opposed to the
usurpation of rights that the unidum
had practiced of late years

  the primary purpose of the organiza-
tion of the brothers of humanity was to
end the enslavement of the brains to
this purpose had agarth and the many
disciples of their cause devoted them-
selves after the first sporadic attempt to
smash all brain-controls which ended so
disastrously agarth and those who had
escaped had conceived a new and far
cleverer plan to achieve it they needed
a large membership of staunch adherents
then on a certain date at a certain hour
members of the brotherhood were to en-

ter every one of the two thousand brain-
control chambers in unitaria and simul-
taneously ruin them by opening the nutri-
tion boxes and injecting a virulent poison
into the fluid pumped to the brains

  this in itself was merely a gesture
announcing that the brotherhood had de-
clared its existence to the unidum then
with every brain-control inert and use-
less the brotherhood was to arise and
defy the unidum to ever try again to set
up brain-controls the leaders of the
brotherhood were confident that public
opinion would sway their way accord-
ingly the unidum suddenly confronted
with such purposeful antagonism and
realizing that counteraction would pre-
cipitate a bloody revolution would be
forced to accede to the demands of the
brotherhood

  when agarth joined williams and
terry at dinner that evening the conver-
sation hinged around the great day when
the brotherhood would drop its mask of
secrecy and face the unidum

  just how asked williams will the
poisoning of the brains be done

  well that was one of our greater 
problems answered agarth it ha- to
be done efficiently and without a h h
only by demonstrating to all unitaria
the masses as well as the unidum that
the brotherhood is a powerful orgauiv-
tion can we hope to win out the burn-
ing news that will fling to all unitaria-
all brain - controls ren-
dered useless organizl-t
group defies unidum to re-
new them-will cause the majority
of citizens to flock to our banner but if
we render useless only half or less of the
brain-controls the unidum will laugh at
us and destroy us knowing the masses
will have no confidence in us in plain
words that first open move of ours must
be complete and efficient

  sadly enough this can only ie accom-
plished at the sacrifice of many live
every man who goes to poison a brain
on that great day roill go a willing mar-
tyri you see the only practicable way to
destroy the brain in a brain-control is by

poisoning and to do that one has to
open the nutrition box and the opening
of that rings an alarm so the poisoner
will be captured in each case the uni-
dum will execute them summarily ttnth-
out trial r

  is there no way to open the nutrition
boxes without ringing the alarm 

	agarth shook his head the metal of
the boxes is an alloy impervious to
all chemicals to heat-torches and to
mechanical violence hence the only way
to get at the pump inside is via the lock
and door since the lock is too intricate
to pick it must be forced for that pur-
pose each of our men on that day will
have a small tool with spreading prongs
which will be given a terrific leverage by
means of a draw-serev this inserted
in the key-hole will force the tumblers
of the lock and allow the door to he
opened but the insertion of anything in
the key-hole that conducts electricity im-
mediately rings the alarm however each
man will have time enough to inject the
poison before the guards come hut not
time enough to escape

  it is not a pleasant thought-all those
lives to be lost but it is the only way
no other way of killing the brain is
quick and sure enough to accomplish our
purpose

  almost at the same moment terry and
williams had an identical thought

  the acid terry said williams
the one that eats steel

  terry nodded eagerly the lock
mechanism itself must be of ferrous
metal because the impervium alloy cant
be machined that finely the acid will eat
it away in a wink

  yes agreed agarth but acid car-
ries electricity the alarm will ring just
as certainly as in the other case

   terry leaped to his feet not this acid 
it doesnt carry current it is a compound
of helium and chlorine it is as non-con-
ductive as oil and at the merest con-
tact with ferrous metals it throws nascent
chlorine loose and free helium

  strange said agarth ive never
heard of that compound

  very few have said terry quickly
its a recent discovery and not yet
widely known or marketed only by great
fortune did i have a bottle of it in my
laboratory which hackworth knew about
and without which we should never have
escaped prison

  agarth now sprang to his feet in ex-
citement if its true that it carries no
current then it is truly a godsend it
may mean the saving of many lives
terry we must get some of the acid and

  arising from the water a long thin
sliver of metal with wide and incredibly
thin wings left the shores of france and
soared gracefully into the rosy sky of im-
pending dawn tts three motors sang a
song of power it ascended the crimson
vault of heaven and when the air grew
thin and cold flaming gases belched from
its rear pushing it forward and upward
mightily in a grand arc it puffed its way
to the height of twenty miles and then
leveled out its speed so great that the
dawn never broke into broad day to the
occupants

  inside the ship williams clutched the
arm-rests of his seat with involuntary
terror amazed at the powerful surges
that pressed his body back against the
leather at his one side agarth smiled a
little at his tense lips and the tiny beads
of sweat on his brow terry at the other
side stared out the window hardly less
affected than williams although he had
had a ride in a stratosphere ship before
in a seat immediately back of them sat
mbopo not terrified but with his simple
thoughts all jammed and incoherent at the
experience

  sarto je bni muttered williams
i feel like im going to mars at a million
miles an hour

  agarth chuckled yes i know wil-
liams everybodys first trip in a strato-
sphere rocket ship is a terrifying thrill
the grand upward sweep the throb of
enslaved brains



power at the back the pressing hand of
inertia   

  they were bound for san francisco
and the main headquarters of the broth-
erhood in one of the organizations rocket
ships-the fastest mode of transportation
in  having completed his organizing
work in europe agarth had left the
paris headquarters in the hands of others
all the higher officers of the brotherhood
were now converging on san francisco
to await the great day which was only
three days off in europe under agarths
guidance hundreds of grim brothers of
humanity awaited the zero hour when
they would saunter into the brain-con-
trol chambers as casual visitors and then
at a certain hour do the deed that was to
end the enslavement of the brains

   in an hour the rocket ship had reached
its high cruising level artificial air
pumped through the air-tight cabin heat-
ing units hissed softly and kept out the
cold of the upper reaches the pilots
after reaching a velocity of a thousand
miles an hour throttled the rockets to the
point where they did nothing but keep
the speed constant

   then it was easier for the passengers
the awful backward pressure let up and
constricted chests were able to breathe
naturally once again

  we will be there in seven hours
said agarth eight thousand miles in
eight hours counting the hour to ascend

  and i thought the hyp-marine was
fast commented williams

  the panorama revealed to their eyes
was awesome in its grandeur the flush
of their permanent dawn suffused the
scene below with its undulating billows
of clouds at times a wide rift in the
cloud-bank would unveil the shimmering
green of endless ocean the hint of vast
distance was there williams felt that
he was looking at earth from another
planet through a telescope above and
around the stars shone as brightly as
light globes and even when the dawn
slowly caught up with them and pushed
the rim of the sun above water the stars
continued to shine defiantly

  some rocket ships have ascended as
high as two hundred miles said agarth
at that height one is in space to all
practical purposes and the corona and
halo of the sun fail to dim the stars
have any rocket ships gone to the
moon or some planet asked williams

  they have gone but never returned
there is no case on record yet of any
party arriving successfully and signalling
back from the moon one unfortunate
space-pioneer ran out of fuel just in time
to fall into the moons gravitational field
and become its satellite astronomers to-
day in the big telescopes can see his tiny
ship swinging eternally in a narrow orbit
-a wandering coffin

  at the mid-point of the ocean williams
espied through broken clouds a sizeable
object apparently floating on the surface
at times a red shaft of the suns light
would reflect from it

  sarto what is that he asked to
be visible at all from this height it must
be a monstrous thing

  that is a pet experiment of the uni-
dum scientists answered terry after
fixing his eyes to the object there is
a great deal of secrecy about it it is
supposed to le a plant to produce energy
from sunlight the set-up of mirrors is
on a raft a quarter-mile square the
mirrors collect the suns rays not only
from above but from below-those re-
flected by the vast body of the ocean when
flie face of a wave turns right at any
one moment countless square miles of
wave faces reflect light to that set-up
it collects them and also the direct rays
and converts them into energy it is still
experimental but i hear the unidum has
high hopes in it it has cost them years of
labor and scientific effort there are al-
ways dozens of scientists aboard and
many more skilled tradesmen

  if the unidum would only concen-
trate itself more on things like that in-
terjected agarth instead of on an in
human scientific mistake like the brain-
control it would be all right that sun-
power affair when and if it becomes
practicable can do only good


wonder stories for august 

  unless they think of installing a few
brain-controls there too said williams
deprecatingly

  high over the american continent
flashed the rocket ship passing once an-
other but much larger stratosphere plane
it was cloudy weather over most of the
land but williams could see by the way
the towns and cities rolled up and then
down the horizon that they truly had a
terrific speed when the rocky moun-
tains came in sight the rocket blasts died
out altogether and the ship began to settle
downward the pilots turned and said
something and agarth showed williams
how to turn his seat around so that he
would face the rear he saw a good
reason for that not long after when the
ship fell into thicker air and began to
decelerate mightily

  for long minutes williams felt that
a gigantic hand was pushing him up into
the sky then there was a cough from
the front and a moment later the en-
gines burst out in a powerful whine for
a half-hour they passed through swirling
clouds suddenly it was clear and wil-
liams saw the wide bosom of an ocean
rise to meet them a slight bump and
swishing slide through water then
silence and rest

  here we are said agarth spring-
ing up behold the pacific on the left
behold the first hour of dawn we left
at dawn and arrive at the same time
he chuckled and opened the door re-
vealing a wooden dock we are a hun-
dred miles down the coast from san
francisco a brother is awaiting us with
an auto in which we will drive to the
brotherhoods headquarters there you
will meet the two generals whose sagacity
and zeal have made possible our crusade

chapter xii
daring

	in the terrible all-nations war of

  - japan mightily armed and
possessed of a formidable war-fleet had
attacked the united states and taken over
the whole western sea-board in a short

month when a hitherto lax war depart-
ment of the latter nation had aroused it-
self and decided to take back the terri-
tory it was found that the enemy had
ensconced itself securely in underground
strongholds they were just as deter-
mined to hold what they had gained as
the rightful owners were to get it back
the final result was the same enervated
deadlock that occurred in europe

  with the advent of the unidum the
yellow enemy retreated fearing attack
from europe by way of siberia but
their elaborate camouflaged strongholds
remained a symbol of the war-fever that
had very nearly destroyed all civilization
in one of these near the city of san
francisco the brothers of humanity had
set up their main headquarters there
were no highways near it and from
above it was invisible supplies were
brought in and iigents arrived and left
in all secrecy had the unidum so much
as suspected that such a nest of con-
spiracy existed they would have borne
down on it in full strength that there
had never been betrayal showed how cau-
tiously the brotherhood worked and how
staunch were its trusted members

  williams looked with awe upon some
of the rusted cannons which were scat-
tered throughout the caverns separated
from the light by traps which could be
opened by the pulling of nearby chains
not four decades before they had belched
flame and smoke at besieging armies
agarth led them through passageways
that connected bomb-proof chambers far
beneath the guns there was a smell of
mustiness pervading the air they
breathed as though decaying bones in far
comers had never been cleared away
now and then a man passed them salut-
ing respectfully to agarth in several
lighted rooms whose doors were open
williams could see men laboring with
papers and codes and radio instruments
this was the core of the network of the
brotherhood

  finally agarth knocked upon a door

  come in said a man opening the
door the generals are expecting you
enslaved brains



  it was a large room whose clay walls
had been bolstered with concrete at the
far end several men sat at crude tables
writing at the near end against the wall
was a desk at which sat two men who
now arose to meet them

  major agarth welcome

  agarth saluted then turned to intro-
duce terry and williams to the two
generals hagen and bromberg terry
gasped at the names

  hah said bromberg you recog-
nize us by name 

  yes i-i believe i do stammered
terry professor bromberg and doctor
hagen were the two scientists who wrote
the monograph on the after-life of
brains in the brain-controls and who
were impeached by the other scientists
and then disappeared

  exactly agreed bromberg seat
yourselves all of you

  he continued  yes we are those same
two scientists three years ago we made
our investigations and published our re-
sults thinking that they would cause the
abolition of the brain-controls and bring
honor to ourselves how different it was 
we were arrested dragged before court
 oh the misery of it-as though
we had been common criminals  we were
exiled to asia because scientists cannot
be executed by law there for two years
we labored for the federation of asia as
honored savants but the disgrace of our
banishment rankled in our hearts then
we became imbued with a desire to end
the enslavement of the brains we heard
of the attempt of major agarth and his
men to smash brain-controls and got in
touch with him after their sensational
jail-break the brotherhood was then or-
ganized and three days from now may
fate smile upon us we will end the ty-
ranny of brain-enslavement i

  both bromberg and hagen were well
past middle age the former was of an
exceedingly grave demeanor quiet and
seemingly meek the latter on the other
hand was a fiery soul excitable and
talkative his dark eyes gleamed with

almost a fanatical light as he spoke he
waved his hands in emphasis

  after his short speech of introduction
bromberg brought his voice down to nor-
mal as it had risen to emphatic thunders

  marshals williams and spalh we give
you welcome into our organization i
know already a great deal about you
major agarth has sent me relevant de-
tails via code as doomed by the unidum
to be the victims of wore insidious brain-
controls you are doubly welcome with
the formula you sent a week ago for the
new acid we have already manufactured
and sent from our laboratory here bottles
of the compound to all our various agents
in unitaria the results of your tests
also indicate that we will strike our first
blow against the unidum without their
knowing it until it is too late even to ap-
prehend the various men who will poison
the brains the first thing they will know
the machines in the food plants will begin
acting strangely they will investigate
perhaps not till hours after the poisoning
ha they will see the lock corroded
they will open it then they will know

  brombergs eyes glistened in joy then
he turned to exchange a few phrases with
hagen

  general hagen wishes to confer with
major agarth if you marshals williams
and spath and the black man care to
have lunch with me    

  after assenting they followed brom-
berg from the office to a nearby dining
chamber

  bromberg ran an approving eye over
williams you are a brawny man mar-
shal williams agarth tells me you have
been in africa the past forty years one
could tell you have led an active life and
your escape from the boston prison and
the run-around you gave the police ha i
-remarkable are you a man of luck or
great enterprise

  a man of quick wit and sudden
plans said terry quickly sincere in
tone

  williams flushed under his african tan
i think luck plays a great part in my


wonder stories for august 

life general otherwise i should have
been dead in africa years ago

  bromberg nodded  only hope you
have brought some of your luck with
you into the brotherhood perhaps    
perhaps well need it the unidum may
react differently to our first bold stroke
than we think it may be that already the
seed of corruption has grown    

  he paused then  let me tell you some
things about the unidum i was in the
medical bureau for years and learned a
lot the unidum of today is heading
towards tyranny and decay and the first
signs of it are the eugenics law and the
brain-control innovation

  it is sad but true that no matter how
noble or idealistic a new regime starts it
invariably falls into corruption after a
time when the unidum arose in 
it was the greatest single advancement
civilization has ever known its members
were the souls of integrity the most in-
telligent noblest of the entire federation
they founded a totally new type of gov-
ernment and gave it a hearty start that
carried it safely to  ten years ago

  then came the eugenics law a won-
derful idea but applied so heartlessly and
wrongly scientific eugenics will some day
remodel the world intoa finer better and
saner place the average intellect will
rise cripples lunatics deficients will dis-
appear  people will be born more nearly
equal but a eugenics law which begins
with tyranny as the present one has can
only do questionable good because it un-
dermines the morality of all concerned
loveless marriages are a return to feudal
aristocracy with all its evils

  previous to  the unidum had
worked like a clock but after the passage
of the eugenics law there arose dissen-
tion in the government many of the
scientists hagen and myself included
were opposed to the law and wished it
taken out however the other faction
prevented such a move then five years
later the second great blow fell-the en-
slavement of the brains

  now what the masses do not realize
-and even what many of the scientists

do not realize-is what that would even-
tually lead to a cold inhuman scientific

social system in which the scientists
rapidly increasing in number through the
application of the eugenics law will
completely dominate a dwindling citizen-
ship whose brains will go after death to
run the machinery of the world the
result in a few centuries will be a world
of men who will call themselves scien-
tists but who will be slothful menial
monsters living like decadent gods in a
completely mechanized world falling to
certain decay

	the others had stopped eating at these
astounding words they listened open-
mouthed as the fiery professor continued

  and the whole diabolical scheme
originated in the mind of but one man-
the present executive molier of the
unidum it was he that perfected the
brain-rejuvenation process he must have
conceived his plans long before he became
executive his is one of those minds that
in their ruthlessness and power-lust fcan
form the future of civilization his co-
partner executive ashley is a mere
puppet powerless against moliers supe-
rior will it is the latter who truly dom-
inates unitaria today and by his per-
suasive powers his subtle propaganda
he has begun the corruption of the erst-
while noble unidum if not checked he
will lead them to absolute tyranny and
eventual decay

  bromberg paused and lowered his voice
to normal i see by your faces that these
are unexpected revelations to you and
well they may be for very few outside
of the brotherhood have even the vaguest
suspicion that a black cloud has darkened
the future you wonder too how it is
possible for one man to carry forward
such fiendish plans you must understand
that the unidum in order to exercise its
utopian principles and forge ahead rap-
idly had invested absolute authority in
the central government it controlled all
industry it limited private wealth it
supervised transportation and communi-
cation and it gave to the two executives
enslaved brains



dictatorial pozvcrs it has long been the
custom for the peoples parliament to
copy-cat every move of the house of
scientists with the latter legislative body
dominated by executive molier it has
been easy for him to get the eugenics
law and brain-control act through

  yet so cleverly has he acted that very
few indeed see the nemesis behind it
he has made the people believe that the
eugenics law is commendable-more
scientists more advancement as for the
brain-controls more of them less work
for the people

  bromberg waved them back to their
food but what evil has been done can
be undone the unidum is not yet cor-
rupt  molier has only made a start once
his power is broken all will be well that
is the primary purpose of the brother-
hood-to strike at the vitals of moliers
insidious scheme the eugenics law and
the brain-control act

  but isnt the threat of tyranny sort
of unreal asked williams after all
molier is but a man he must die soon
after his death will not the whole
sckeme puff away like a breath of foul
air

  you dont know molier returned
bromberg his evil genius foresees that
his perverted ideals must live after him
or his work is for nothing accordingly
he has poured poisoned words into the
ears of many unidum scientists he has
painted for them a lurid picture of a
future in which the unintellectual masses
will not be there to hinder the advance
of science it is so easy to sway a scien-
tist with talk of scientific utopias ac-
cordingly he has many staunch adher-
ents they form a sort of unorganized
yet growingly powerful sect through
andrew grant secretary to executive
ashley we have obtained the names of
the scientists who are known to favor
molier we have even learned who it is
that molier has picked to succeed him
when he dies professor jorgen is his
name a man hardly less cunning and
ruthless than molier-

  terry and williams looked at one an-

other in astonishment professor jorgen
the scientist to whom lila was to be mar-
ried  at brombergs query terry quickly
explained the matter

  heaven forbid exclaimed brom-
berg that your sweetheart should
marry such a fiend he no less than
molier must be stripped of all authority
and power if unitaria is not to become a
vast experimental laboratory for a group
of mad scientists

  i wish he were standing right here
in front of me said terry eyes blaz-
ing i would smash him to pulp id 
id    

  yes of course you would-if you
could get uch a chance but not in that
way could their schemes be destroyed
you two are now marshals in an or-
ganization that will either smash molier
and save the unidum or   but wc
must not admit that there can be failure
three days from today the brothers of
humanity will rise m al their righteous

  it is a decision i cannot make said
agarth i will have to refer it to one of
the generals come we will see them
about it

  they left the room in which williams
terry and mbopo had slept and trav-
ersed underground corridors to the cen-
tral office bromberg looked up from
various papers with a tired smile

  sorry to disturb you at such a time
began agarth but i must ask for your
decision marshal williams has made a
request to be delegated to the poisoning
of the boston brain-control

  bromberg turned to williams in sur-
prise what you wish to risk your
life-

  i do said williams with determina-
tion in his voice the boston brain-con-
trol has in it my sisters brain i tried to
smash the globe which holds it once be-
fore and it led to my sentence for trea-
son terry with me since that time it
has been my secret vow to release my
sister from that mental torture which


wonder stories for august 

you and doctor hagen have proven tor-
ments a brain in a brain-control further-
more i fee that i have done nothing
noteworthy for the brotherhood as yet
at least in being one of the poisoners i
will have done my part

  marshal williams said bromberg
slowly i will not attempt to dissuade
you for j can understand your personal
feelings about the matter let me shake
your hand-you are a brave  man
for the first time terry and williams
bad an insight into the humanness of the
professor hitherto he had been merely
impersonal the leader of a great move-
ment now his eye was moistened in feel-
ing

  and if i may make a request said
terry i wish to accompany williams
terry no you- it was williams
shaking his head

  general bromberg continued terry
your answer

  go and god be with you it is such
spirit as yours that will save us from
tyranny major agarth attend to the
details

  they left the general then and only
after an hour of instruction did agarth
leave them after a hearty hand-clasp in
another hour terry williams and
mbopo were escorted from the under-
ground headquarters into a cold clear
night a silent guide took them to an
auto which left the vicinity with an al-
most noiseless purr of its motors reach-
ing the coast an hour later they were
hurried to a waiting airplane a speedy
sansrun in it they were to be taken to a
small city in california from thence to
embark for boston in a public air-liner
each of the agents sent out that night to
american cities for the poisoning of the
brains embarked from a different city
in europe the same careful system had
been used

  in another ten hours in the early morn-
ing of the next day two thousand mem-
bers of the brotherhood would simul-
taneously look at clocks open the black
metal nutrition boxes after destroying the

locks and pour a small vial of deadly
poison into the jar from which the pump
sucked liquid food to send to the brain
in the globe above 

chapter xiii
death to the brains

	we are in constant danger of arrest

  said terry as they stepped from an
electro-car in boston if anyone recog-
nizes us as the same two men who not
two weeks ago tried to smash the brain-
control his eyes searched around for
the blue and red of unidum police

  i suppose so said williams stepping
forth boldly yet i think the very daring
of it is our protection

  escalators took them downward pass-
ing a loitering policeman on the way to
the food products building terry held
his breath cold eyes fastened on them
for a moment then flicked aimlessly
away terry soot lied a beating heart
they were unrecognized after all they
looked no different from the thousands
of other men on the streets and mbopo
was not the only negro in boston why
should the unidum guards intent on
keeping law and order every day be
thinking only of those two bold bad men
who had many days before blunderingly
thrown a wrench in a brain-control 
terry began to realize that it was only
natural  police should stop them with
an eye of suspicion

  as for them entering food products as
they now did to see the awesome con-
trivance which ran dozens of machines
were there not visitors daily doing the
same thing the unidum could have no
suspicion that within an hour all the
brain-controls would cease to function
yet the nearer they approached the more
nervous terry became he felt for the
tiny flat aspirator in his inside coat pocket
it was there safe enough and williams-
he had in his pocket a tiny vial of a vir-
ulent poison

  the earlj morning-it was only nine
oclock-had been picked for the zero
hour as there were few sightseers abroad
enslaved brains



at that time they stepped into an empty
room

  five minutes whispered terry that
closely had everything been planned

  williams drew a long breath as he
once again gazed upon the globe which
held his sisters brain he felt a fierce
exultation but the hallucination that his
sister was talking to him did not come
as it had that other time he was sane
and cool now he had an important com-
mission to perform and it must be done
carefully and quietly-no blundering and
losing ones head agarth trusted him to
do the job right

  williams spoke to mbopo in dialect
then to terr- mbqpo will watch at the
far door you stand at the near one
if all is clear ill go ahead if not-well
take the chance that all the other brothers
are taking all over unitaria and go
through with it give me the acid

  when terry at one door and mbopo
at the other nodded williams sprang
lightly to the pit level with calm fingers
he inserted the aspirator nozzle in the
keyhole of the black box and pressed the
bulb there was a sharp hiss he glanced
at the alarm bulb above it was dark he
tried the handle it stuck

  more acid with the nozzle twisting in
his fingers louder hissing but still the
handle would not turn keeping his eye
on the alarm bulb he sprayed again and
again till a strong smell of chlorinic sub-
stances pervaded the room sarto what
spiteful thing kept that half-destroyed
lock from yielding beads of sweat were
on his forehead now he wondered if the
other agents of the brotherhood were
having the same trouble

  a fierce whisper from terry startled
him something coming  hurry

  williams squirted the acid till it was
gone and desperately threw his weight on
the handle with a loud click it suddenly
yielded swinging the door open wil-
liams stretched trembling hands toward
the foremost of two jars guided by
agarths descriptions and instructions it
was easy for him to unscrew a threaded
cap at the top

  goodbye helen he said in low
tones as he dropped the gelatin vial into
the jar it is for the best the action
of water on the gelatin would turn it
porous and let the poison out

  williams swung the door shut and
turned ready for anything

  jump up here quickly hissed terry
they wont know    

  it was only two elderly women loudly
telling each other all about the brain-con-
trol and too busy at that occupation to
notice that two men looked flushed and
excited about something waving to
mbopo to join them in the corridor wil-
liams and terry left the chamber

  it had worked perfectly it might be
hours before the erratic behavior of the
machines below would be detected they
left the building as calmly as they could
and in a few minutes stepped from the
escalator onto an electro-car platform

  williams felt as though a great kad
had been taken from his shoulders tt is
done it is done these words con-
stantly revolving in his mind brought him
a deep peace then he noticed that terry
had grasped his arm and was pulling him
toward one side of the island platform
what-

  didnt you hear me man  i said im
going to call up hackworth tell him
weve succeeded and are all right and
    ask about lila

  terry stepped into a phone booth while
his companions waited outside he
emerged a minute later with a happy
smile on his face lila she is still
sleeping soundly hackworth was over-
joyed to hear my voice knowing the zero
hour he knew we must be safe he want-
ed us to visit him but i told him it would
be inviting disaster

  right terry it wont be healthy for
us here in boston or anywhere in the
east in a few hours we must get to the
west coast-

  they turned startled at a shout a man
in blue and red uniform was tugging at
the lightning pistol in his holster and run-
ning toward them already two other

guards at the far end of the platform
were running to join him

  were recognized gasped terry in-
stinctively he glanced at williams for the
initiative

  the latter swept an eye to take in the
scene the long and narrow platform
sparsely populated was a bad place to be
confronted by police yet the escalator
was too far to make a run for it they
would meet the guards at its entrance
far down the tunnel-like span he could
see an approaching electro-car in its mul-
tiple grooves no escape-but there were
only three guards to  

	williams whispered rapidly to terry

  and then to mbopo the latter nodded
with a fierce grin terry set his jaw grim-
ly pale but resolute

  the guard who had first shouted hurled
explanations to the two who came up and
together they ran to where the three men
waited quietly

  youre under arrest cried the fore-
most minion of the unidum he waved
his pistol threateningly better come
quietly

  just a minute said williams with
mock surprise why are we under ar-
rest what have we done

  sensing something out of the ordinary
a small crowd formed about them the
police waved them back as they crowded
eagerly close

  arent you two dan williams and
terry spath wanted for treason and jail-
breaking asked the guard somewhat
taken aback by williams calm demeanor
of course you are i recognize your
features-

  why  why  such insolence
exclaimed williams looking hurt as
though insulted do you hear that
briggs-turning to terry-suggests
we are those arch-criminals who tried to
wreck a brain-control he faced the
guard sternly sir do you mean to say
out of three million people in boston you
had to pick out us upon whom to practice
some sort of misdirected horse-play

really now we resent this and shall re-
port you

  the guard had changed color at the
bland words the hand that held the pis-
tol lowered in indecision his fellow
guards who had not recognized the ques-
tioned persons but had merely flocked to
their companions aid at his shouts looked
around embarrassed at the crowds titter-
ing

  well i must do my duty as i see it
said the first guard doggedly you two
closely resemble those criminals at least
i shall have to ask you to come with me to
the nearest police office for a check-up

  shall we allow this fellow to disgrace
us asked williams half-turned to ter-
ry or shall we-the electro-car had
now come up and was hissing to a stop-
gwe them what they deserve

  it was the signal terry was waiting
for as one the three of them leaped for-
ward-suddenly three hard fists knocked
three uniformed men flat the quickness
of the attack had forestalled the latter
from even raising their pistols which
they had been holding loosely at their
sides during the conversation

  the crowd scattered with cries of
alarm most of them toward the escalator
the rest stampeded into the electro-car
and with them were williams and his
companions it being an automatic trans-
fer station there was no conductor to
raise an alarm the driver in the motor
compartment seeing nothing of- the
fracas pursued his scheduled duty and
the electro-car hummed away from the
platform on which lay three prone fig-
ures one of them staggered erect shout-
ing futilely for the car to stop then he
picked his fellow guards up looked
hastily for pistols which he could not find
and raced to the phone booth to raise an
alarm

  inside the electro-car williams terry
and mlpo grinned at one another a
they sat down near the exit the few
people who had witnessed the affair and
knew the culprits looked terrorized in
their direction as though expecting them
to jump up and begin a general massacre
enslaved brains



the rest of the passengers sensing the
excitement looked around avidly curious
and asked one another what it was all
about

  safe for the moment breathed wil-
liams but theyll be on the lookout for
us we must get out of boston and the
sooner the better

  i have a plan said terry hurriedly
theyre liable to have guards at every
station on this line looking for us before
long in a few minutes well be at the next
automatic transfer station if we transfer
from there to a lower level line well slip
out of their hands because they cant
have guards looking for us at every sta-
tion in this city

  good returned williams he pulled
something from his pocket and thrust it
into terrys hand without revealing it to
nearby passengers

  terry gasped as he felt the smooth out-
line of a lightning pistol

  just before i ran to the electro-car
explained williams i picked up two of
them one for you and one for me they
wereilying there so handy and it only took
me a second how do you work them
button on the side where you hold
your index finger said terry but be
careful with it the catch near the firing
button has two positions the one for a
paralyzing charge the other for a kill-
ing charge and if we ever get caught
with these-

  williams smiled terry you forget
were already criminals with a death sen-
tence the possession of- pistols cant
make us worse felons and we may yet
have a use for them before we get away
scot-free    

  terry jumped up releasing his seat-
bands as the electro-car came to a halt
come on we transfer here

  followed by the wondering eyes of
several of the other passengers they
stepped from the door williams glanced
hastily up and down the platform and
breathed in relief not a policeman in
sight terry led the way to an escalator
at the next lower level he turned into a
banistered walk that took them to the

middle of one of three platforms the
car grooves ran into an enclosed span
which right-angled the span above from
which they had come

  while waiting for the next electro-car
to come up terry looked apprehensively
around fearing that the unidum guards
thereabouts might already have received
instructions to search for the criminals
an electro-car rumbled out of the rear
span and stopped before them as they
entered terry saw a blue and red fig-
ure dash from the escalator opposite
waving its arms and shouting but too
late the electro-car whisked away

  theyre on our trail terry informed
williams to fool them well skip the
next station and stop at a terminal well
pay another fare but take a sixth-level
span express service hardly any stops
there were no shouting guards at the
terminal and the three embarked safely
on a sixth-level span car it rumbled on
its grooves at frightful speed

  nozv let them locate us smiled terry
grimly with three misleading transfers
between us

  now how do we get out of boston
terry was silent in thought for a mo-
ment at the next transfer station ill
take a look at the city guide because
frankly i dont know where we are in
boston then we can get to an air-port
and-

  he frowned only thing is williams
word will have been received by now at
every air-port to watch for us there are
always plenty of police at air-ports us
three especially with mbopo along dont
stand a chance to get aboard without be-
ing stopped every train depot will have
notice so will the hyp-marine depots and
docks and theres only one way left to
get out of the city-with the exception of
walking which is foolhardy-and that is
by automobile

  then by auto it is said williams
but you dont understand there is
 such thing as public service in autos
they are all owned privately we would
have to  to confiscate one like
thieves


wonder stories for august 

  that shouldnt stop us after all ele
weve done returned williams with a
shrug

	an hour later found them in the west
suburbs of boston watching the sparse
morning auto traffic and the occasional
pedestrians they stood under the shadow
of trees whose leaves were autumn col-
ored and ready to flutter downward at the
next stiff wind a cool breeze swept upon
them from the open streets they shiv-
ered for they were dressed in clothing
designed for warmer temperatures

  its not so easy terry was saying in
pessimistic tones we cant very well
jump into a moving car without risking
our necks those parked are sure to be
either locked or without the ignition key
we havent the money to buy one-
cant we hire a taxi and then throw
the driver out

  taxi taxi what is that after
williams explained in some surprise
terry shook his head we dont have
such things in this day and age williams
people either use electro-car service or
own a private auto

  je bru it bra exclaimed williams
perturbed at the outlook well we cant
go back to the downtown section thats
sure a horde of vultures in blue and
red are scouring around for us there and
the longer we delay here the worse it is
once they find out that the brain-control
is poisoned and later when they hear that
all the brain-controls in unitaria have
been tampered with unidum guards will
be looking with suspicion at everybody us
included

  after some silent thought williams
moved away from the trees weve got
to find an auto with keys perhaps if we
walk along a few streets and look into all
parked cars we might find one waiting
for us to jump into and go

  an hour of such searching did no good
as if fate were spiteful all the autos
were either locked or useless in the ab-
sence of a key for the ignition williams
began to grip the pistol m his pocket

tightly and cast his eye at slow-moving
autos passing them once they got in and
held the pistol at the drivers head    

  he felt his arm gripped by spasmodic
fingers it was terry his face paling
listen to that voice i

  they had come to one of the public
news-markets set off from the street and
large enough to seat a hundred persons
it was open to the air and from the flared
apertures of fan-grouped loudspeakers
came the stentorian voice of the an-
nouncer

  boston brain-control ruined blared
the voice the brain in the globe has
been poisoned two women found there
at the time the inspection took place tear-
fully denied having anything to do with it
they claim three men one of them a
negro were leaving as they arrived
search is now being instituted through-
out boston it is feared the three culprits
have escaped for they were accosted at
electro-car station level four no tea
and fled after attacking three unidum
guards the lock on the nutrition box-
the announcer went into detail while
terry and williams looked at one an-
other aghast already a swift crowd had
jammed die news-market at the startling
statements

  lets get out of this vicinity mut-
tered terry rapidly now we are in for
it he continued as they turned a cor-
ner and walked away from the giant
voice that was telling all the world about
them and their deeds

  and that means we must get busy
supplemented williams do it or die for
there-

  wait listen admonished terry
the stentorian voice barely audible to
them now was saying

  -reports from new york philadel-
phia and pittsburgh that the brain-coa-
trols in those cities too have been poi-
soned  this seems to be the beginning of
an anti-unidum move-

  not to mention what they will fiod
out when professor bromberg and doo
tor hagen will be broadcasting to uni-
enslaved brains



taria soon smiled williams grimly but
now for ourselves-terry follow me and
dont be afraid to use that pistol if you
have to

  williams had seen an auto stop before
a house a hundred feet away out of it
stepped two men it was the chance they
had been waiting for

  the men looked in surprise at running
figures coming at them

  we need your car said williams
without preamble

  what is this spluttered one man
with a scornful leer in his voice he was
tall and powerfully built

  hand over the key grated williams
we want your car and well fight for it

  the man looked around for police and
seeing none swung a fist that missed the
face it was aimed at then he backed

away muttering at the sight of the pistol
which terry was aiming at him

  it doesnt pay to fool with us said
terry your key

  reluctantly it was handed over ill
have you jailed for this

  better men than you have tried it
sang out williams as the auto hummed
away from the curb a moment later

  terry drove as swiftly as he dared
winding along the streets till he struck a
feeder-line to the highways outside the
city at high noon they reached worces-
ter and there took passage on an air-liner
to san francisco at that city they con-
tacted one of the brotherhoods under-
cover agents and were driven by auto to
the general headquarters jt was close to
midnight when they finally entered the
secret underground passages

dimensional fate

      by a l burkholder

       continued from patje 

  just the same we had better take a
look around muttered the one whom i
had so offended

  have you a search warrant i asked
with some hesitation the older one
admitted that they had not

  then gentlemen i regret that i must
ask you to leave us alone as our experi-
ment is a very delicate one and it is now
at a very critical stage you see we are
conducting atomic experiments and the
least interruption or distraction now
might spoil the work o years that is
why my partners and co-workers partic-
ularly enjoined me to admit absolutely no
one tonight

	this occasioned considerable more
hesitation and discussion between them
but finally the chief apparently made
up his mind he turned to me and said
i know you and the other gentlemen who
are working with you sir and i do not
doubt your word but we were ordered to
investigate the shots and screams that
were reported here and we have to obey
but i have already explained to you
the importance of our not being dis-
turbed t rejoined and i absolutely for-
bid you to trespass here now

  you all know i continued that i
am a lawyer of considerable standing and
i promise that i shall prosecute any or all
of you who may force your way in here
tonight but come back in the morning
when our experiment is completed and

you can investigate to your hearts con-
tent warrant or no warrant

  but not heeding my protests they
pushed past me into the laboratory for
a moment i stood alone in the anteroom
and i confess that i felt rather panic-
stricken and was strongly tempted to bolt
out of doors and do a vanishing act but
the sight of a patrol wagon and three
policemen outside quickly deterred me so
i bolstered up my ebbing courage and
walked or tried to walk confidently into
the laboratory

  but why dwell upon what followed
suffice it to say that despitfe our pro-
tests ben patterson and i were dragged
into the waiting patrol wagon and taken
to the municipal jail where we were duly
quizzed and then locked up with no
chance to devise a more probable sound-
ing story we were obliged to tell the
truth and as i had predicted we were
disbelieved and laughed at we were
found guilty and were condemned to die
by the district court and an appeal to the
state supreme court yielded the same re-
sults an insanity plea appeals for exec-
utive clemency everything failed nobody
would believe us and nothing would save
us except the building of another dimen-
sion translator which we would not do
even if given the opportunity

  well this weird tale is drawing to a
close and i hear the warden approaching
probably to tell me that the end is almost

a visit to venus

    by festus progneil

      continued from page 

  hello is that the receiving station on
the moon  hello is that the receiving sta-
tion on the moon i am a man speaking

from venus

  by now the record should be started

 a man speaking from venus the
venusians are waging war on earth
their space-ships are dropping huge but
light spheres full of disease-producing
spores into the earths atmosphere you
must find some way of destroying the
spheres before they reach the lower lev-
els i dont know how it can be done

  his dry throat refused to proceed
there was no answer there could be no
answer for some time yet so that he had
no means of knowing whether his mes-
sage was heard or even whether he had
succeeded in getting the apparatus to
work

  his head ached appallingly making the
outlines of the room unsteady around him
he thought of his life on earth his hum-
ble beginnings his struggles his colossal
power that had been a colossal swindle
ah well it had been so easy to be dis-
honest and the rewards were so huge
the world rewards dishonesty and pun-
ishes honesty he was not really to blame
for what the structure of society had
forced him to the harmful drugs sold as
medicines that had been the beginning of
it the companies he had floated later
whose disappointing results he had bol-
stered up with ever more and more wild-
ly inaccurate bookkeeping assets shown
at ridiculous values or included in the
balance-sheets of six different concerns
huge claims by each of his companies on
the others all remaining silent about what

they were supposed to owe auditors who
had to certify what he told them or lose
their means of livelihood weigh it all
up and his life had been an utterly harm-
ful useless thing the world was much
worse off by reason of his life and the
others were the same sooner or later
they crashed and the world still blindly
trusted those who managed to maintain
the illusion still

  as a youth he had longed to be great
and to do good only to find that he could
not do both finding himself among men
playing a financial game where the most
unscrupulous won he had set out to play
that game well never thinking of the
human lives he was juggling with

  his pain was gone probably a sign
that the end was near he thought of
harley strange how that man had dom-
inated him brought him on this journey
that he loted had known from the first
could end only in the death of both of
them his own boasted power over men
had only been power over their purses
and food yet he now felt no animosity
against harley

	padding steps were approaching but

  he knew that before they could reach
him he would be beyond all harm it
seemed to him that the apparatus itself
reared up on long legs and fell upon him
filling the air with flying wheels that spun
and gave off sparks like fireworks

  he felt his knees giving way and knew
his sense of balance was gone the floor
rushed up-

  but he never felt it toudi him

 do not destroy any univorses when you take a step
 supposing that you do step on atoms harboring in-
 telligent life the creature on the electron-worlda
 would never know it you could not disturb their
 happy life if you stamped for an hour to destroy
 their universe would require disintegrating the atom
 the dream of scientists for hundreds of years a
 couple of years ago an atom or bo was split but it
 is a very expensive proposition and good only for the
 experiment you cannot imagine how small an atom
 is it has been estimated that a spoonful of hydrogen
 nuclei placed sibe-by-side would reoch around the
 visible universe-over one biuion light years in cir-
 cumference it would take too maiy lines of storoe to
 this amount in miles so sleep well and forget

the temperature in space

 editor scibnch qdbstionb and a nswbus 

 every so often i have some sort of brain-storm and
 have to pop a now question or two at you heros one
 that has bothered me for some time

   regarding the cold-or lack of heat-of space vfhr
 ould a space-ahip necessarily have to be insulated
 against cold when the greatest warming agent in the
 solar system is doing ita darnedest to meil the thing
 the temperature on the moon is claimed to rise to
 such a height as to bo unlearable by humans and yet
 the occupants of a spsce-ship which receives the same
 amount of heat per square foot as the moon are ia
 constant danger of freezing to death  personally if t
 were to venture out into the void clad in a space-suit
 i should first make certain that arrangements bad
 been made to neutralize the terrific heat i should he
 exposed to as well as the supposed cold

   or has the sun gotten old and cranky enough to
 scorch only planets t	y grewn

                                    beverly hills calif

   your argument is a let more logical than that
 put forth by a lot of science-fiction authors it last
 seems to be a habit to believe that space is cold of
 course space itself can have no temperature being
 almost a perfect vacuum-only material things can
 have temperatures then what we want to know is
 will things in space be cold or hot when the rays
 of the sun strike objects they the absorbed rays are
 converted into heat we have a blanket of air sur-
 rounding the earth which absorbs a lot of the suns
 heat otherwise we would get it full-force and if
 anything should lift the ionized layers of the atmos-
 phere from the earth ail of a sudden purely hypo-
 thetical everything alive would probably be destroyed
 by the ultra-violet raya-that is everything exposed
 to the sun

   we might say then that objects in space near the
 sun would be in danger of burning or melting rather
 than freecing in either case careful protection would
 be neceusary

   if a man were suddenly exposed to apace where there
 waa no sun within several light years what mold
 happen some may say he would freeze solid instant-
 ly there is no reason to believe this his body is at
 a temperature of  decrees fahrenheit when he is
 thrown into space where is this heat going to leak off
 to there is no air around him to absorb it so his body
 temperature would probably sink very slowly as it

could lose heat only by radiation as for matter in
the form of separate ft torn-cosraic dust between
fainlies eddington thinks it may hove a velocity
corresponding to a temperature of  degrees f

  we cannot force all of our anthers to accept these
theories for they are only theories perhaps the cos-
mic rays would have something to do with the effects
of exposure in space also but one mans gaeas is as
good an anothers until so ni mine actually carries out
a practical experiment most authors also picture
empty space ife an utter blackness pierced here and
there by intensely bright pin-points the stars with-
out the atmosphere of tfve earth to absorb the light
of most of the stars the universe to an observer in

  there have been many many volumes written a bo at
the human and animal senses all of which are in-
tensely interesting and well worth the reading we
will say a few things about the sense of hearing here

  an object which vibrates disturbs the air causing
ripples to emanate in all directions we can detect
those between  and  vibrations per second with
our ears this ib over ten octaves in the musical scale
the ear is a much simpler organ than the eye and is
connected to the brain by the auditory nerve while
this nerve has  fibers which arc insulated by
myelin the optic nerve has about fifty million ele-
ments  what is commonly called the ear is merely
the reflector of the waves that travel down the chan-
nel to the drum which is the diaphragm set into
vibration by the disturbance in the air this vibra-
tion passes on to the hammer anviland  stirrup
in the middle ear so named because they are shaped
somewhat like those familiar implements tho vibra-
tions then travel into the inner ear where the auditory
nerve conveys the sensation to the brain the brain
interprets it into intelligent ideas some people can
hear vibrations above or below the normal scale and
we have heard of many eases where people have heard
sounds audible to no one else dogs for instance

comets and the solar system

editor sciencb questions and anwteb

  i know you do not mind britishers writing i think
your book is the beat of scientific fiction i have read
i wish groat support and world-wide fame its simply
great  well now you have had my praise sir i will
humble myself to a couple of questions which i should
be ashamed to ask

  	how large is a comet 

  	what really ia the solar system

  i would be very thankful to see an answer in your
column

                                albebt mashu
                                london england

  we always enjoy hearing from our numerous brit-
ish readers

  	a comet is composed of a nucleus and a tail
their sires are measured by the diameter of the nuclei
and the lengths of their tails are also computed by
astronomers their sizes vary some are larger than
the earth and some are much smaller-as small as
only a few miles in diameter however they are
thought to be composed of rare gases having verr
little if any solid matter their tails are composed
of gases also some scientists believe thot a small
bit of solid matter exists in the center of the nuclei
of the largest hallcyy comet discovered in 
rotaras to blaee past tho earth about once in every
 years it was last seen in  it is an awe-
inspiring spectacle that comes hat once in a life-
time

  	the solar system consists of everything held by
the gravitational force of our san sol and is billion
of miles in diameter-kditok


wonder stortes for august 

the science fiction league hab gained tremendous
popularity and publicity in the short time it has
been in existence-or rather in organising for it
has by no means really started to exist yet as the
powerful institution that it ia bound to develop into
a the years go by we ore confident aud want you
to be that the ijiagiie in no flash in the pan but
iike the advance of civilization it will expand and
grow and eventually envelop the entire world with
members in nil corners of the globe-mcmbeni by the
thousands and chapters by the hundreds why should
we be so snre of ourselves -because we have already
had a taste of the enthusiasm and the determinate co-
operation of the scant several hundred members that
the league has  date why not join now while we
are yet little note than a name instead of waiting
until the science fiction league is among the lead-
ing fraternities on earth there is more glory in be-
ing a veteran member

   some people know of the existence of science-fiction
bnt do not believe that it is any better than other
types it will be the duty of members of the league to
show these uninformed potentials the superior points of
the literature others devour the books of verne wells
and poe and all the science-fiction movies avidly without
knowing that it in science-fiction and being in igno-
rance of the fact that monthly aaarcoa of their favorite
literature exist that makes three types of potential
fans we have seen already

   	those who do not know the superior qualities of
science-fiction

   	those who have never heard of it the great ma-
jority of potentials

   	those who have nu unconscious longing for it

  the science fiction league is not just another

eiub but something to be carried forward by future
generations-by pur descendants who will give  a
special distinction as being the year in which the
league was formed-a date to go down in history

the science fiction swap column

   no doubt you have already noticed the new science
fiction swap column the first edition of which ap-
peared in our july number this is one of our first
moves in the science fiction league it is an oppor-
tunity for members as well as other fans to secure
valuable additions to their collections at very reasonable
costs either by placing an insertion in the wanted
department or taking advantage of the offers in the
far sale section most rabid science-fiction fans
are most enthusiastic over keeping a collection and will
find this column of interest they find it a rare thrill
when they glance upon some old science-fiction maga-
zine or classic for the first time-something they have
long been searching for most everybody like to col-
lect something and the science-fiction fan naturally
falls into collecting his favorite literature not only is
there the satisfaction of having a large collection but
the materials composing it are of an edncational and
entertaining nature-they offer endless hours of di-
version-something that stamp and coin collectors
cannot boast of the advertislna department has made
the cost of advertising in the science fiction swap
couth n ridiculously low so thnt members of the sci-
ence pjctton league can make use of it for prac-
tically nothing

the science

scienck fictiow league in the interest of science-fiction

       pep editorials

   in last months issue of wonder storrsa we placed
an editorial filler taking an entire page really oa edi-
torial pep talk we intend to use something of
thib nature every once in a while chiefly to acquaint
new fans with science-fiction in a short while by
familiarizing them with science-fiction and the science
fiction leacue sometimes it is years before the
fan realizes the power and value of science-fiction
and we hope that these editorials will shorten that
period we invite members of the league to offer sug-
gestions to use in these editorials we have often found
that our readers have valuable ideas that aid us greatly
and we do not want you to make a secret of them
we might say that  heads are better than one

how to form a chapter

   we have already received many inquiries from mem-
bers concerning the proposed chapters of the league
we have been withholding the formation of these
branches in order to have as many members of the
league as possible to join them-the more members we
have the more chapters there will be and the more
members they will have several ambitious member
have offered to start chapters if yon want to be one of
them send in your name to us in the following issue
after we receive your name we will publish it with
your address all members of the league in the im-
mediate district who would like to join the local chap-
ter and we hope all of them will will write direct
to the member who wishes to form the chapter-the
director as he will be called after the chapter is
well under way a new director may be elected if
necessary when the director of the proposed chapter
has several names on his list he should wait for at
least three weeks after the magazine appears on the
stand in which his name appears he will send the
list to the assistant secretary at headquarters in
new york the list will then be okd and a certificate
issued announcing and declaring the existence of tho
chapter

if you wish to form a chapter write to ue and aay
i would like to be tlie director of a chapter of the
league consisting of members in and around blank
state please publish my name in your next issue
and then sign your name when you as director
have received letters from members in your district
for at least three weeks applying for entrance into
your chapter send the list to ue stating as follows
john dow director of blank science fiction
league members who wish to join chapter- and
then list them we will give your chapter an official
name and number from then on the name and ad-
wonder stories for august 



drcaa of your chapter will bo printed in every teaue
of wonder stories bo that those who become members
of the science fiction leagub from time to time
who live in your neighborhood may join increasing
the size of the chapter duca or fees of any kind may
be charged within local chapters in order to carry
on special activities only upon the agreement of nl
the members thoso members who do not wish to
contribute will not be expelled from either the chap-
ter or the lbaoua by not doing so in other wordu
all contributions must be voluntary though a specific
amount may be decided upon this will bo done only
within local chapters-there will be no dues or fees
of any kind conducted by the league headquarters
treasuries accumulated by this method may be used
to issue pamphlets hire halls or lecture rooms or
any other reasonable thing that the director and local
members see fit to use it for tfiis also includes out-
ings parties etc the director or his appointee will
be the presiding officer at eaoh meeting assistant
director secretary and treasurer may also be elected
by the local members however aocurate minutes
must be kept a duplicate of which will be seat to
headquarters within one week after the close of each
meeting important activities reoorded in tho minutee
will be discussed in this department which will be
the voice of the lkaqub and all its chapters meetings
may be held at any frequency everything to be de-
cided by the local members all helpful suggestions
made by members during any meeting will of course
be recorded in the minutes and therefore prove of
value to other chapters there is to be no competition
between chapter-they are to co-operate and perhaps
after a while we will have a grand convention some-
where with delegates from the various chapters would
you like to be a director of a local chapter of the
lbag os  there will be very little responsibility on
your part and it is not hard to find a meeting place
if you cant start right off with a lecture room or
hall or one of the members homes then you can meet
in the nearest public park until the chapter la larger
and can afford something better

  we would like to rtceive volunteers for directors in
the following cities aa soon as possible boston man-
hattan bronx brooklyn philadelphia detroit cleve-
land baltimore washington chicago buffalo st
louis san francisco denver and lob angeles in
particular-and of course any other well-popniated
area if we receive more than one volunteer from
any particular city or area we will honor the firat
if you have volunteered and your name does not ap-
pear in the next sbuc of wondbk stories but some-
one elsea in that district instead send your name
immediately to him and join his chapter you will
then be the first one considered when a second chap-
ter in the city ia needed or a new director for tho
one you have joined we hope to receive many vol-
unteers this i the best way you can show your en-

thusiasm for the lbaqub at the present time form
a chapter and make it something to bo proud of-
a credit to the lbaqub

essentials

  there has been some necessary delay in preparing
the first essentials of the leaoub for which we ok
your pardon but we are now well stocked up with
seals buttons certificates letterheads and envelopes

the other science fiction clubs

  we print in purt a letter from william s syr
member number  of the science fiction lhagum

  it was with great pleasure that i noted the inaugvt-
ration of the science fiction lbaqub which ia to be
sponsored by wondhk stokiiw this was one of the
wisest moves the could have been made at this time
its advantage should be two-fold in the firat place
tills lbaqub should prove a fine circulation butldar
for our mag and in the second place it should
servo as a strong union of stf fans throughout the
world however i trust that this will not mean the
exclusion of all news of other clubs from the reader
speaks columns the lbaqto should serve as a
confederation of these clube rather than a competitor
you will find i am sure that members of all or
most of the old clubs wit eagerly join and look up to
the leaoub not as a rival of other stf organizations
but rather aa a big brother in this way the leaoub
should become one of the greatest powers for mutual
good-will among ail true followers of scicntifictinn aa
a real old-timer and a rabid fan i uaed to buy mr
gernsbacka first stf mag way back in  i welcome
and approve the science fiction lhaoub as a bond
of good faith joining the minds and hearts of all true-
blue fans in an indissoluble union of unaelfiah good
feeling

  you will undoubtedly find many members of the
international cosmos science club following the lead
of our secretary mr john b michel and myself in
lining up with the new organisation

  we are very pleased to print this good word from
mr sykorn a very active fan and wish to assure
him that the science fiction ijsaoub is a competitor
of no other organization we want all other scienco
fiction clubs to become branches chapters of the
leaoub being composed of the most enthuslastio
fans they will undoubtedly agree to this for thoy can
advance much faster and easier nnd become greater
as a part of the lbauuk than they could by them-
selves if for instance the new york branch of tho
international cosmos science club wisho to join tho
lbaoue they will probably be designated as tho new
york icsc science fiction lavotm this i csc

wonder stories for august 

international cosmos science club there can still
be another new york chapter of the leagua without
the csc or with manhattan instead of new york
in the title the names will not be confused and mem-
bers of the other organizations will be able to belong
to both though they will be fused into one all clubs
which join the- league will have this department
to discuss their activities besides any other organ of
their own

  when another science-fiction club wishes to become
a local chapter of the sfl each member who has not
already joined the league must do eo of course be-
fore the chapter ib declared no chapter of the sfl
can have members who have not joined the parent
tdy and received a certificate from headquarters

  it will not cost anything either to form new chapters
from disassociated members or other science-fiction
clubs and it will lend prestige to any branch to be
known as a chapter of the science fiction league as
the years go by it will be much easier to secure new
members with the sfl in the title of the elab by
joining the league the club icsc or any other
reputable one puts no restrictions on its activities
there can bo nothing but profitand benefit in the act

  of course as an example if the new york branch
if the icsc wishes to become u chapter of the league
that does not mean that all uther branches of the
icsc will have to join though of course we hope
they will each branch will join separately as an in-
dividual chapter of the sfl the entire icsc with
branches all over eould not join as one chapter each
chapter must be in a definitely located district so that
local members can easily get in touch with each other
and hold meetings

  all members who join a branch of one of the other
science-fiction chibs which is a branch of the sfl
must of course join the lhague also if they do not
want to join the icsc for instance they will find
another chapter of the league nearby whioh has to
iifflliation with the icsc

members correspondence

george gordon clark the very first member of the
league makes a suggestion in the following letter

  i am a member of the league and am desirous of
seeing it progress i have followed the ideas behind
the league but  have yet to see any mention of how
members are to find who their fellow members are bo
that they can communicate therefore i offer this
huggestion if it has not already been taken care of

  have a list printed of all regular members of the
league the same being revised every three months
to be furnished only to regular members at a small
nominal cost of say about five cents to cover the
cost of getting it up

as this list will be sent only to members of the
league you can easily jodoe the amonnt needed it

will also serve to keep the ideals of the league in-
tact by preventing non-members from gaining these
names and addresses and also prevent unscrupulous
people from using the same as they must be approved
or have their name on the list before they can offer
reading material to the members or approach them
with something supposed to have the sanction of the
leacue

  it will also help those who wish to become per-
sonally acquainted with other members for the pur-
pose of starting cluhs in their districts

   hope if this idea has not already been taken
care of the same will meet with your approval

  we thank member clark for his kind suggestion
as you will notice how to form a chapter is
announced in this issues department and members
correspondence was discussed last month

  yon will remember that we said it would nut be
fair to furnish each member with a complete list of
all other members either by publishing it in this de-

eartroent or issuing special pamphlets this might
rinir too much correspondence to certain members
some of which will be from those they do not wish to
correspond with this overloading would necessitate
the negleeting of many members and become unite a
burden to the recipient

  we feel that it is better to let everyone correspond
with only those lie wants to therefore if you wish
to correspond using your new science fiction
league stationery of course send in your name ss
follows

  john dow box i new york city n y-boys
between the ages of seventeen and twenty in new
york state interested particularly in interplanetary
flight

  this is only an example you may say anything
else yon please hut remember when you send in your
entry that you will be obligated to answer all mail
filling your requirements other mail from persons of
other ages or districts yon may neglect without ill-
feeling on the part of any member or the parent
body

  william s sykora member number  of the sci-
ence fiction league would like to exchange corre-
spondence with young men of about  twenty years
of ago who are especially interested in thne-travel
locality unlimited his address is - st st
long island city new york-

league suggestions

  here are a few advance suggestions of how you can
help the science fiction league

  	if you wish to form a local chapter of the
lbacijr get a newspaper to print a notice in the
society or eluh section they will do this free of charge
and it will aid you in securing many members

  though it is true that i have noticed with your
other correspondents the decline of the mas from
october  to march  i consider wondbb
stobjhs an excellent method of opening the readers
eyes to the wonders and possibilities of science and
invention i laugh at all your readers who dare to
criticise your policy of chan king the tee shape
fotmat authors artists etc ail i can say for these
critics ib let them put on the editora shoes and try
carrying out their own programmes  they remind me
of the following anecdote pat says to mike
wouldnt it be awful now if england gave us every-
thing we wanted and mike replies to pat just like
her to play us that dirty trick

ber which has not yet come to my hand it is
ray habit and preference to keep serials by me till
i get the last instalment then i read them through
without having to read each part at intervals of a
month each not easy to recall what i have read four
or flve weeks before i do not mind what artist you
choose for the illustrations so long as the portrayal
of men buildings machinery and nature is accurate
i must say however that paul ia my favorite artist
in the illustration for c b kruses the heat de-
stroyers saatys effort made me feel as if i had
just taken some quinine i
wili there be any possibility of stories of the lost
continents of atlantis and lemuria stories of peoples
of those countries armed with deadly weapons and no
forth similar to j b harris the third vibrator t

  the oover excellent i wish however that you
would remove the strip best in science fiction afi
it serve absolutely no pnrpoeo at all as far aa i
can see in the smau size it takes up too much valu-
able space i hope that you will not have tbe s f

enough seals already

  the stories super-excellent with green cloud
of space and earthspot tying fior first place-
xanduls was a true masterpiece a worthy boo
ceaaor to the exile of tho skies although not quite
es good as predecessor the tone machinc and
traders in treasures wore both fine the former
especially good for its thrilling action however i
think that the short atory is being overdone there
should be more and longer novelettes such as the
land of mighty insects i expect into the in-
finitesimal to be exceptionally good dont disap-
point me

 i am somewhat sorry to hear that the proponed
annual will feature only stories from the old won-
dobs as that means that i have probably read them
i would like to see stories such as the rebel soul
the mouthpiece of zitu the messiah of the oyt-
inder and the squadron of tho air reprinted
however if you must take them from the old won-
dhrs please take dr kellers the human termites
i started to read sciencb wondbb with the dec 
issue and that story ended in the preceding fasue 
would like to read it since it was praised so many
times

  the s f league has been needed for a long time
i have already sent my application for membership
and am anxioubly awaiting my pin etc

  when do wo again hear of the strangers chib t
laurence manning is by far your beet writer hurry
up more yarns by this talented young man before

 also do we ever again hear from the charming
gawain edwards and more stories from john bey-

that genius paul

editor won ter stotues

  the june cover was marvelous super-excellent
i jist cant understand why some peopta fail to ad-
mire and appreciate the work of that genius paul i
tnow of no one who can match his drawing abso-
lutely nobody i

  the editorial was very good

  then i read into the infinitesimal by kaye ray-
mond first of all  must congratulate the author of
his great story it was packed with adventure mys-
icry thrills ond what-not hut the science could
stand some correcting

  the author did not explain the reducing process
minutely but as i understood it the principle char-
acters re-arranged the particles in their bodira and
in the machine now the only obvious way to make
an object smaller in that manner is to place the
particles closer together so that the space between
them i greatly reduced so far all right

  however if there was absolutely no space at all
between the particles of their bodies they would still
l-e much bigger than an electron they would be as
many times bigger than an electron as there were
particles in their bodies

  to make this more clear i will illustrate let us
imagine that the entire milky way was contracted
so that there would be no space between any of the
sons and planets this would of course contract it
enormously but the final result of the contraction
would not be able to land on a sun for the simple
reason that it would be innumerable suns huge 
hope i have made this clear

  in continuation if it were possible for the char-
acters to land on an electron they would demolish
it because the matter of their bodies would be like
reutronium countless difficulties are involved

  however except for some of the science the story
was great

  the doorbell was a great narrative keller is
a master of the pen tor should i say typewriter

the job again

expected the ending was very unueual more shorts

  your arguments against the science in into the
infinitesimal are very logical we had a hard time
deciding whether we should accept the story or not
the etory itself as you say was excellent but the
science was questionable however we decided fiat
wc should not deny our readers such a good story
because of a little scientific weakness we try and
uncceed most of the time in keeping only accurate
and plausible science in our stories we will have to
suppose that the characters in into the infinitesimal
had some method of decreasing the size and weight
of the atoms in their bodies when they travelled into
the atomic universe though taine of san francisco
did not appear in the doorbell you will sec him
once again in dr kellers next story the tree of

    the shakespeare of science fiction
editor wonder stobibs

  the cover of the march won in siomba is up to
pauls standard clearly depicting the scene the edi-
torial was very interesting containing many instruc-
tive facts

  as for the brnin-eaters of pluto if variety is the
spice of life that was pepper in my eye albeit pleasant
pepper of the genus that evokes cachinnation irre-
ardlesa of the perusers estimation give us more like

  children of the ray further verified my assump-
tion that mr haggard i in frank colloquial language
k swell author

  martian madness was certainly worth the time of
reading it left me in deep thought

  mr manning scored another hit in caverns of
horror it contained a plausible and interesting plot
ard wus very well written lets hear more from the
stranger club

  and after all my waiting comes the long expected
keileryarn it was well worth the wailing keller is the
shakespeare of science-fiction i would certainly like
to get some of the gland secretions or should i try
the corkscrew i wonder how keller would settle this
problem of a struggling author

  the exile of the skies not only filled my expecta-
tions but overflowed them such stories are rare
nowadays and one sprinkled here and there is a
blessing tell mr vaughan to continue his excellent
work

  the poems and the various bits of information were
interesting as was the reader speaks

  the april issue also started off great with the eo-
porb cover and the announcement chalk op this avid
scientiflctionistas a member im for it and all that

f oes with it the science fiction leaoub will surely
ncrense the renders of stf

  then i read the land of mighty insects except
for the now hackneyed plot of warm lands at the
poles it was a great story exceedingly well written
and held me eyes glned to the pages till the heart
rending termination hurry with that sequel

  the moon devils was a good story though some
of my friends didnt like the title mr harris is be-
coming a regular dyed-in-the-wool author

  the menace from space contained nearly the most
amazing plot ive ever read it was an excellent
story extremely thought-provocative a seiuel here
is also required

  the end of the universe was short and sweet
always print at least one short story in the iraue

  the last planet was ok starrl still retains that
good old style of his

   after thinking it over i admit winters illustrations
are very good especially the one for the last
planet i realize that variety is needed you win

  hurry up with the conclusion of xandulu and the
kelleryarn the doorbell

  yours very supercallifcdulisticespiallidosciously is
that so	raymond peel mahielul

  according to laurence manning you will hear
more from the stranger club we do not advise you to
take dr kellers advice about exciting pain in erder
to write like a genius remember what happened to
the man with the longitudinal head in the
reader spenks of our may issue

  we are glad to see that you at last see the merit in
winters work our readers have nraised him very
highly

  suppose you send us a definition of that fifteen syl-
lable word in your last paragraph we cant find it
in our dictionary-editor

      the two new departments

editor wonder stobibs

  i have been a reader nf science and mechanics and
wonder stories ever since i was introduced to them
over two years ago and have always found them ex-
cellent magazines for the serious scientific investigator

  the reader speaks and science questions and
answers have a very great attraction for me and i
would buy wonder stories just to have these pages
alone-even if i had no faith in stf-which heaven
forbid but as a member of the british interplanetary
society-and a striving author-i find great thought
and theories being pulled out from the dark  helves
of my brain to explain the phenomena that we meet
with in the pages of ws georob a day

wonder stories for august 



  we have been oonvjnced that the two departments
you mention the reader speaks and sclonce
questions and answere form an essential part of
the magazine and it would be a great loss to omit
them but now wo have added two new departments
-the science fiction league and the science
fiction swap column these latter two have been
instituted in order to spread the gospel of science-
fiction and help fang secure the books and magazines
that they have long hunted for without success-

an author speaks

editor wonder stokibs 

  let me congratulate you and wondrr stories on tjo
march issue it was splendid all the way through
and all the stories were exceptionally good-in par-
ticular martian madness by cleator and exile of
the skies by vaughan of tbe former let me say
that seldom have i read a story more interesting and
nicely written of the latter there are not enough ad-
jectives of praise to fully eulogise it your prediction
at the beginning of the first instalment tht it
would be a classic is proved to my mind certainly mr
vaughan is to be congratulated on that fine tale i
think it is obvious that wonder stories is forging
ahead rapidly under the new policy

authors in science-fiction watch for his stories the
robot aliens dawn to dusk thieves from isot

ticing that each of hia stories is belter than the one

the favorite of our readers for the year -

print as many as we find space for-editor

unbounded enthusiasm

editor wonder storiks

  wonder stories really is the beat science-fiction
magazine printed it has always been the best science-
fiction magazine printed you dont hold the authors
back they can write a atory as fantastic as they
wish you allow for imagination and that is what
brings out those things that are tbe spirit of a sci-
ence story-theories ideas food for thought your
aufchors have free rein also they must be stimu-
lated by the wonderful pictures drawn by paul i
can easily see that wondbb stories is not striving for
popularity among everyone as some bcience-fiction
magazines are doing continue our good editor con-
tinue

  i prefer stories which are supported by tho woird
effect which paul puts forth in his pictures stories
which contain good science new ideas and are writ-
ten with gusto and spirit thats a perfect story

  the spore doom the last planet evolution
satellite and caverns of horror mannings very
good-more from him are the best stories ive read in
a long time monsters of oalhsto cant be ignored

ill never forget it i havent rend xandulu yet bt
i will enjoy it after i have all the instalments mooa
plague hit me below the belt-that wan a dirty blow

  winter has a clean style but i like paul better
however the two excellent artists must satisfy every
reader

  the science fiction leauue is a wonderful thought
well join well support

  please dont continue a story to the back ot the
magazine-its a hindrance when a reader wishes to
save a serial or short storics-

  i hope people will soon realize what a valuable
literature science-fiction really is gtouer ayers

                                   lewiston idaho

  your enthusiasm seema unbounded we are proa
that we have such loyal readers as enthusiastic sup-
porters of wonder storib it is your type that wfll
make the science fiction league the bigtresl forward
step that fantasy haa taken in many years wo know
that you will be one of our very first members-

editor wonder stories 

  this is another letter written by one of your beloved
cranks vide page 

  a story by john edwards caused me to dig my
thinking box out of the snowdrift and set it akoiag
hero is the result mr edwards story ia one of the
two or three printed during the life of your publica-
tions which treat the character of an advanced civil-
ization in a logical manner viz that a civilization far
enough advanced to have mastered the deeper secrete
of nature and tapped its mightier powers haa to be
benevolent and co-operative to the exclusion of all oom-
bativeness greed and lust of power else it will uso
it powers to destroy itself utterly

  take any advance in science foreshadowed by oar
present knowledge control of gravity atomic power
concentratcd vibrations of a deadly nature more de-
structive chemicals ditto germs or disruption of atomic
structure any and all of them would be promptly
used for the satisfaction of some national grudge and
revenge and for the enslavement of some unfortunate
part of humanity setting up new tensions and grudgrst
looking for new weapons to reverse tho process this
would go on until ah humanity was blasted off this
planet if the planet itself were not blown to smither-
eens by the losing faction in a grand suicidal geate-
in fact tibetan lamas claim that this is what hap-
pened to the missing planet

  so it stands to reason that any humanity far enough
advanced to attempt successful space-travel hafl to he
absolutely peaoeful and that all the stories depleting
visitors from spnee as child-eating ogres aro off the
mark and belong in the shocker class and looking
at your board of associate editors wondwi stooirh
is not supposed to belong to that rowdy class

  now a few pictorial errors page  the plug
is too small to get the sheet out and the cylinder too
short to contain same page  the story says oov-
ers not bars page  perfect the stories them-
selves are above the average frederick g hetir

                                 sayville n y

  it has always been our belief that man cannot
be completely civilized until war fa absolutely abolished
in every form shape and manner war is caused by
the lust for blood-h quality that should belong only
to animals however there is no reason to believo that
space-travel oould not be perfected by creatures who
are warlike

  your last sentence satisfies us very much after all
the stories themselves are first to be considered-

though xandulu was a close second the improve-
ment in the last few issues hk been noticeable

osition before you and tbe readers of ws-ie the

appeared in ws in the past i would joyfully hail the
appearance of the human termites the con-
querors and the livening star by d h keller

txile of the skies the revolt of the scientists

  we are not as yet prepared to reprint our old
stories in book form though the suggestion is a good
one however the beet stories that we have published
during the pest five year may noon be used in a
wonder storibb reprint annual publication date
of this magazine has not yet heen decided-editor

he withdraws his objection

editor wondbk stories

  since most of the reader- are either impassive or
in favor of that sacred cut  as main objector
withdraw my objection and take my beating without
a murmur although my personal opinion is un-
changed

  your inauguration of the science fiction lhagub
makes me want to forget all the brickbats i have
and substitute instead one huge wave of applause
you will find my application blank enclosed

leading stories lately have been lunar consul

	call of the mech-men evolution satellite mole-
men of mercury moon plague man from ariel
literary corkscrew martian madnees moon
devils and eartbbpot earthspot is one of the
l-est if not the best of the stories which  have been
flexed to read moon devils portrays the most
likely form ol human life on the moon

  a word on illustrations ere t close tho cover b
without doubt the most important illustration and
one of the main factors which influences one to like
or dislike the magazine the subject of the picture
too l of great importance realistic one such as
the moon plague cover and moon devils cover
eems as though im moonstruck maybe but have
od intentions are to my mind the best colors
hould be scientifically correct and not too gaudjr and
contrasting paul is best with winter and his tine
figure-work runner up all others have been tried
trough and should be discarded sehneemane into
the infinitesimal illustration is poor-looks as though
he drew it while running for a streetcar the june
rover should have been taken from adrift in the
void instead of into the infinitesimal

   i find that you average five interior illustrations per
issue why not add several half-page or even ouar-
t-r-page illustrations to the long stories short
ptorfes like cosmic calamity should have half-page
cuts at least as did a shot frora the sky

  ae long as the artistic standard keeps pace with
i hr literary standard your mag will never degenerate
into the class of your competitor which i read only to
make wonder stories taste all the better

  bring on the annual-use good paper-same size
volume-plenty of illustrations by paul and winter-
vtcries by popular authors and itll sell like hot cakes i
may your circulation increase -fold

editor wonder stories

  im afraid that i just had to write you a letter
to tell you of my great liking for your now ascending
magazine in my estimation it ir now ranking a
one of the highest science-fiction magazines

  but to the stories of late at the head is exile of
the skies new nokchow different and exception-
ally well-written next not one story hut all if 
harvey haggards mark him a one ot tho greatest
authors of unusual and marvelously written stories
his plots are original his characters belong in the
future which they are portrayed in they lit dont
lose him because if you do ill wager that a mighty
storm of resenunent will batter ye editor

  the reader speaks via the advertisement why
cant you pot the pictures of sex and money-making
ideas at the back or front  see my ojd friend bob
tucker points this out thats not the only tiling
i agree with him on and youve probabiy guessed it
-the covers as far as artistic ability is concerned
w s has the best but as to the scenes chosen for
it they are the worst now you say we are dif-
ferent i agree but as long as paul is illustrating
your covers you have the best artist of all so pick
out scenes of scientific apparatus instead of bugs
for a good example take the april  issue the
cover depicts the battle between the moon devils
and the earth-men why didnt you use the illustra-
tion for the menace from space by edwards
which by the way is the bet story in that number
and should have a sequel	thos r daniel

             our individuality

editor wonder stories 

  before turning off tbe power and bitting the hay
let me give you some of my opinions concerning your
periodical

   since this ia my first letter i shall be a little soft
on the sledge-hammers and rtilling-pins on the con-
trary i want to compliment you on the great im-
provement your magazine has made i not only re-
ceive hours of enjoyment and pleasure but many in-
teresting scientific factb

  the sole thing which i really do like nhout your
stories is that they never seem to be thrown around
from one place to tbe other they have individuality

  since you changed to the smaller size there stand
out six stories which  enjoyed to the utmost

  spore doom

  vengeance of a scientist

  literary corkscrew

  green cloud of space by eando binder-this
story was a gem

   into the infinitesimal

  the land of mighty insects

  the part in the story land of mighty insects
which amused me very much was where the girl
learns the methods of romance from one of shake-
bpeares illustrated plays and causes the whole thing
to end up in a me-s i suppose the author put this
character into the story only to liven things up a
bit

  aa to my favorite authors there is only one stan-
ton a coblentz i like the humorous veins which
he runs through his stories and which he never neglects
to include

  that short story which you printed brain-eaters
of pluto wasnt bo bad but it would have been better
if it would have bad a little more futirical humor
so heres hoping for more humor in your stories

  by the way while on the subject of humor an in-
cident impresses my mind clearly i was informed
by one who had travelled through persia that as he
passed over a great tract of land and inquired what
the name of the place was they told him it was the
queens veil to which be adds that another wide
field lay by it was called the queens girdle-moreover
that in the same manner there was a large portion of
ground set aside for every part of her majestys dress

haa not had time to develop as yet plans will mate-
rialize as we go along the league has one prime
purpose-to spread the worthy gospel of science-fiction
that is the buais of the league and ita goal will not
be reached until everyone knowb of acience-flction and
respects it as the most powerful literary force in ac
world wo can hardly hope for this for a lonj time

us in reaching that goal is wclcome new ones will
be broached every month by the executives and mem-

  i hear that you are going to publish an annual of

wonder stories for august 

  oh yes there in one thing i must mention before
 close and that is the copy-cat system of your rival
i noticed that whatever your publication did she fol-
k-wed in your footstep- just to be even you re-
member you combined your magazine in tbe summer
months and she did the bame you changed to the
smaller biro and so did she however she thought
ibe could try the trick on you but i see it didnt
work she started her quarterly but stopped al-
together and now i suppose she wants to put out
m annual

  there must have been a mistake when you re-
marked in one of the footing that the voice of at-
lantis by manning was one of the serte written
by him in a current issue i have rend no such
sory

  personally im not in favor of mannings present
stranger club series and i dont think mueh of
winters work either dont get so huffed up mr
kditor and nnyway whose afraid of the big bad
lollypop i prefer paul among any artists which
you try to initiate or force into the magazine

  who may i ask draws the covers for your sister
publication fvkkyday science and mechanics 
was attracted to this magazine when  saw the in-
visible man taking off his bandages

  im waiting for those cartoons and i sincerely
hpv they are humorous i hope this letter finds its
ny to the pages of the keader speaks

  im going to write again very soon for i want to
jin the science fiction  ague id better end now
 r the fuse just blew out im in the dark now i
iruied ill have to put in a new one oh-thereb
the lights i might as well finish what ive started
for you know the world has millions of starters but
only a few finishers	alexander novak

                                trenton n j

  stanton a coblentz paid us a visit the other day
rnd promised to start writing science-fiction again
so we hope to have some of his excellent stories for
you soon hta thorough knowledge of human nature
has brought him high praise his stories are good
cures for superiority complexes

  the annual when it comes out will contain only
reprints from old issues of science wonder stories
and the early wonder stories and will be put on
sale for probably c to charge any more for it
would be a burden upon many of our readers

  all we can say about your eleventh paragraph is
that imitatiou is tbe sincerest form of flattery

  voice of atlantis by laurenco manning is one
of the stranger club series which you mention near
the end of your letter

  paul also does tbe covers for our sister publication
everyday science and mechanics the scene you
mention was on the cover of the february  issue
we would be pleased to have you as a member of the
science fiction leaoue-editor

  after reading over mr gernsbacks editorial on tbe

cluding instalment of jack williamsons great tale
xandulu is in my estimation tje best story wil-
liamson is in a class with a merritt please let us

  yes indeed the green cloud of space is one
of those stories i-well-written and the best by mr

  druso starts off with high interest ye i like
german translations i still consider american authors
the best however

  earthspot is another of those exceptionally good

anything to nay about your stories and i hope it is
the last i have been a reader of your book for sorao
yearn and up to a few months ago they wore inter-
iating then no ao intcristing so i quit them and
yesterday i thought i would try them agin much to
my sorrow

  why sould i pay  for one story that just held
my interest the title of that story is the greea
cloud of space at that it was not ao hot

  gome now let this vox pox work in and gin
us some good stories and keep your readers give
us our monies worth and keep the readers or keep

   i am fifteen years old and deaf i started reading

 the size from long to short i like the smaller size
 eo keep it that way for a long time or forever and
 from then on i wont have volumes large and email
 i am an expert bookbinder eo have a pretty hand-
 erne set you certainly have improved since  last
 remembered first reading the mag as to the artists
 paul is excellent for his work on rockets supermen
 colossal cities but his human beings are terrible win-
 ter is excellent for his figure work why not let
 winter do the figure work and lot paul do the mar
 rhines and other work  pauls cover illustration
 for the call of the mech-men was a masterpiece
  like the reader speaks columns the people who
 write in their complaints and brickbats look like rath-

 you will notice that these two artists are now doing
 most of our illustrating

    it must be interesting to be able to read a science-

 perhaps you can inform us whether our translator
 made any errors in his work some foreign words

  we are now making a drive for stories with orig-
inal and refreshing plots however there is no rea-
son to turn down an excellent story when it has an
old idea hero and there occasionally the plot ia
the land of mighty inects was not altogether
new but at the same time not nearly as hackneyed
as it might have been we do not want hackneyed
material however though you condemn this story
because there was an old idea behind it you auk for
good old time-travel and space-flight tales the saoet
hackneyed of all especially the good-old ones we
will still give you storiee of this type but they must

a history of wonder stories

editor wonobb storxbs

  i have read nil of your publications since the begin-
ning of your first science-fiction magazine in  it
has been with extreme interest that i have followed
your progress from the days when you used to publish
stf in the old scirncb and invention that was a
good idea by tho way to the present time it has
been more or less an evolution if you dont believe
it you ought to see my files they date from vol i
no  of bix of your magazines beginning there
are your old stf mag monthly and quarterly sail
the one annual ulna 

  the file of your present magazines is rather upteh
and downish if you know what i mean the first
issues of scibncb wondbb and air wondkr large
size were rather thick then ciima the consolidation
and the scientific drtbctivb stories which faded
into amazing dbtbctivr and then passed out alto-
gether shortly after we find wonohr stories month-
ly degenerating into the smaller size while the
quarterly remains the same woe to the poor guy
that ia trying to bind them

  after you were quite sure that everyone had gofcten
used to the small size one whole year without change
a record mr editor i back you pop to tho large size
again and lo and behold-glossy paper i more worry
for the shrimp thats doing the binding  and in
four short issues back you go again to pulp paper
and a short time later to the c size that to me
mr editor was when wondbr stories reachcd rook-
bottom you seemed to have sacrificed everything
just to reduce the price

  back again you went to the two-bit le and then
a little later to the smaller size and no quarteriy
at all the only thing i can figare out is the editors
are trying to tease us if you have aay consideration
wonder stories for august 



at all for us poor leaders lets let the magazine stay
put for a while

  the best stories you have ever published are listed
below in order  had to do a lot of thinking on those
and iu bet nobody will agree with me

  	the evening star by keller in scibnck
wonder

  	the man who awoke by manning in wondsli
stories

  	the flying legion by england in air
wonpbk

  j list a minute mr ger aback before you throw
this into the waste-banket  purposely didnt rate
your ralph c--plua a very excellent etory
became i wanted to give your other authors a
chance

  your best artist there isnt any choice-paul is
i f course

   rate the first twelve issues of both air and
science wonpbr stoulkk the best of any period of
consecutive issues  do  hear the editor objecting 
well i said cojtsccvttve issues the magazine for the
past year though continuing to advance has carried
some rather mediocre stories

   am intensely interested in science films and was
therefore interested in the stills and letter of mr
lenard in the april issue lets have more instructive
letters of this type instead of trash like this one all
my activity on amateur motion picture photography
has thus far been confined to study only you err
by the way when you say metropolis is an amer-
ican film it is german a ufa production americans
dont make pictures as good aa that it would be
interesting to make a scientific film i think

  your announcement of the science fiction league
is another step forward for your magazine i am
waiting with interest for details in the may issue

  by the way i nm also an aspiring author another
one if you dont watch out youre going to have
a new writer on your hands if only to show up
keller manning haggard nnd sehachner

vbknon h jones

                              dee moines iowa

  you have certainly given an accurate account of
the lrfe of wonurk stories and ita sister publications
as you can see it is varied and interesting not
monotonous like the format of some magazines that
never change perhaps it is well that you did not
mention mr gernsbacks ralph c--pub as
one of your favorite stories-otherwise our readers
anight think that your letter was n paid testimonial

  when we listed metropolis as an american film
we meant to include those made in other countries
with english translations as you say rt was pro-
duced by ufa

  we would like to have you as a member of the
sciencb fiction league

  by your last paragraph we think that our readers
will some day be praising the great jones-edi-
tor

she wants to murder manning

editor wonder stories

  can you please give me some information as to
the most painful way to murder an author im re-
ferring to mr laurence manning who wrote caverns
of horror the big galoot gota a person nil hot
up about a cavern full of strange beasts and then
leaves us with the meek statement that after a period
of seven years if the cousin concerned agreed to sell
the estate more might be learned about the caverns
of horror ill bet anything that there are a lot of
people who feel the way i do about him otherwise
the stories in your wonder stories are swell

  ive never read serials but by mistake i started to
read xandulu now im practically holding my
breath while waiting for the next issue

                             miss marion pei-eha
                             saginaw mich

  we do not believe that a young lady like yourself
would enjoy murdering an author so very much es-
pecially in the most painful way-and particularly
mr manning one of our best authors however if

 sneak up behind him some day with a sledge-hammer

  we think that caverns of horror was an ex-
ceptionally good atory because the author left it hang-
ing in the air as wo say which ia more true tn
life than the conventional happy ending perhaps wo
will print a sequel to it seven yearn from now alter
the cousin sells the estate

   we are surprised that you dont read our serials
 they are some of our best work you can save yourvetf
 the suspense from month to month by saving the in-
 stalments until you have the complete story-edi-

tie him up hypnotize him i

 editor wonder stories

   say dont let richard vaughan get away i tb him
 up hypnotize him but dont let him get away ho
 wrote the exile of the skies too well to be per-
 mitted to escape i think a sequel to the land of
 mighty insects would be just the thing as long u
 were on the author subject

   xandulu is a typical jack williamson story and
 ill be sorry when it ends

   pauls and winters illustrations of the moon-tnea
 differ greatly cant those two guys ever agree

                                john muonk

                                    jackson miss

   k would do ua no good to tie down author vaughan
 he might become peeved and refuse to write ny mow
 for us you know the old saying you can tk- an
 author down but you cant make him write i any-
 way thats the editors version-editor

sorry to see the end

 editor wondbb storibs

   i have just finished reading the march issue of
 wondbb stoiubs  am sorry to nee exile of tho
 skies end because r has given me much pleasure
 i hope we shall have more stories from kenneth ster-
 ling such as the brain-ealers of pluto tbe atory
 caverns of horror by laurence manning is my
 idea of a story well i guess ill quit for thin time-
 craruui l harmon
 seattle wash

   the exile of the skies cei-tainly made a big hit
 with our renders and we would not be surprised to
 see it clawed with the bent masterpieces of receat
 science-fiction

   wt find that slap-atick burlesque stories are not
 wantedby the majority of our readers but will con-
 tinue to give you those containing real humor such
 as the recent tyme stories-editor

sequels wanted

 editor wonder storibs

   this is the first time i have written to your maga-
 zine aa i have only road a few isnuee of wohow
 stories in most cases i have found the stories to
 be very good however i wish you would print
 seqaels to two stories that were in the april wonobb
 stokirs

   these abories are the land of mighty insecte si
 the last planet

  the moon devils and the menace from space
are also very good stories

   lets have more stories about interplanetary ex-
 ploration	robert vickhrs

                                  columbus ohio

   we are always glad to present sequela to stories
 when the authors take it upon themselves to write
 them and when they are at least aa good as tha
 original stories-editor
