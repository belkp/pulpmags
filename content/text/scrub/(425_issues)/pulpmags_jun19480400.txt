ki-gor sprang forward with bow drawn

slave of the jackal
priestess

by john peter drummond

 death to helene the voice of momba ngar keeper of uncounted
 sorrows thundered across the swamp where ki-gor struggled in helpless
 agony the awful words were hot darts prodding him forward but where
 the great white lord was blind

the sun rode up over the

flame-tipped distant hills sullen and
red among the water-heavy clouds
the tatoga drums which throughout the
night had proclaimed the approaching cele-
bration to the fearsome diety momba-
ngar faltered and died away the dawn
for a moment was hollow with silence and
then from out on the veldt came the
thunder of stampeding rhinos disturbed
at their morning feeding

  ki-gor white lord of the jungle
stirred restlessly on his bed of grasses
awakening to the soft pressure of helenes
body cuddled close against him he tried
to draw away without disturbing her but

she drowsily held him her softly pouting
lips telling that she was awake he bent
and kissed her

  an immensely exaggerated sigh convey-
ing infinite pity drew ki-gors head up
ngeeso chieftain of the pygmies stood
ten strides away watching the jungle cou-
ple with a pained expression

  wah always it is the same the lit-
tle man sputtered the larger the man
the greater fool a woman can make of
him

  he stared moodily down the thinly
wooded slope and off across the veldt
which stretched away from the edge of
the timber




jungle stories

  it would be useless no doubt to men-
tion that the morning flees away that the
bellies of my men writhe and growl with
hunger hai sometimes i wonder if we
will ever reach the tatoga kraal

  ki-gor smiled at the note of hopeless-
ness which his small friend managed to
inject into his voice actually as the
white lord well knew the only reason
ngeeso was upand about was that he
had chosen the dawn watch for himself
his three hands of warriors still slept on
the slope just beyond the white lords
sight

  aye it would be useless smiled
helene wriggling closer to ki-gor to in-
spire a new outburst from ngeeso

  but the expected jest died in the
pygmy leaders throat the easy manner
dropped away from him he bent forward
hawklike his keen quick glance stabbing
far out on the plain

  swiftly ki-gor what is this thing the
sun reveals exclaimed the pygmy

  two gunshots in the distance lent ur-
gent emphasis to ngeesos words ki-
gors spear came to his hand as he vaulted
up sprinted to his small friends side

  he located in the grey morning light
black dots cutting straight unvarying fur-
rows through the grass as they headed to-
ward the slope on which he stood

  ki-gor drew his breath in sharply a
white man naked to the waist whipped a
lurching exhausted mount through the tall
grass on either side of him ran two
black retainers stumbling and reeling as
they fought to keep their balance by hold-
ing to their masters saddle

  but the three ran a losing race for be-
hind them like a hunger maddened dog-
pack eight black warriors coursed with
furious unfaltering speed a glance at the
warriors oiled and painted for battle
with their yellow-plumed headdresses bob-
bing and leaping told ki-gor that they
were ochari from far south of the veldt
it was unusual for so small a raiding
party to penetrate this far from its own
lands

  ngeeso roused his sleeping warriors
with a shout but there was no longer
alarm in his voice or manner the eight
ochari didnt live who would dare come
against the deadly blowguns of sixteen
pygmies as his men flung upward from

their sleeping mats weapons tight-gripped
and ready in their hands a thin smile of
approval touched ngeesos lips

  he pointed toward the veldt the dan-
gos will catch their prey before they get
this far he explained but it is well to
let them see our numbers in case this
easy kill gives them false ideas of cour-
age

  we must aid them ki-gor declared
for his code was not that of the black men

  ngeesos tone was utterly calm its
no use the horse is done we cant reach
them in time

  we can try ki-gor said and with-
out waiting for the pygmys agreement he
sprinted down the slope

  ngeeso looked at his men giving his
shoulders a helpless shrug as though to
say it is foolish but we must honor ki-
gor they grinned not at all displeased
by the chance to throw a scare into the
boastful ochari

  then with a rallying cry ngeeso sud-
denly darted into action skittering down
the slope like a thrown stone pell mell
behind him came the fierce little demons
who called him leader and their high
wavering yells reached out over the veldt

the white man lashing toward the
slope heard them and his head shot
up in alarm his first thought obviously
was that a band of ochari had gotten in
front of him but when he saw that the
newcomers were pygmies led by a bronzed
giant of his own race his whip rose and
fell across his horse with renewed vigor

   the ochari heard too and realizing that
the pygmies intended to snatch their prey
from them they spurted forward in a
desperate drive to make their kill before
ngeesos men could interfere close they
came until two of them were running al-
most within spear throw of the horses
flanks the white man seemed to go wild
with fear at the thought of being dragged
down so near to safety

  ki-gor saw him suddenly shockingly
raise his whip and beat at one of his re-
tainers hanging to his saddle he rained
blows over the native trying to free his
horse of the exhausted mans weight but
though the black screamed with pain he
held on stumbling and dragging as the
careening mount pulled him along
slave of the jackal priestess



  in an excess of rage the rider leaned
in the saddle and pounded the black with
his fists the horseman was a huge man
with tremendous shoulders and arms and
even from a distance ki-gor could see
the native shudder under the powerful
blows abruptly the black collapsed
knocked senseless by the beating

  his legs dragged for a moment and
then his hand came away from the saddle
he tumbled over and over his course
traced by tossing grass the ochari flung
onto the fallen black their spears hammer-
ing a savage rhythm as they ripped out
his life

  ki-gors lips tightened as he sprinted
down the last of the grade he couldnt
understand how any man even to save
himself could so brutally throw away the
life of another but his personal feelings
did not lessen his resolve to drive off the
ochari

  he was on flat ground now the flash-
ing beat of his long steel-muscled legs
rising to an ever higher pitch in all the
jungle no man had ever been able to
equal the white lords speed in a foot
race he was close to the white man then
able to see clearly the contorted fear-torn
face pressed low over the foam-flecked
horses head

  pull up ki-gor cried together we
can stand them off

  if the man heard he gave no sign if
anything the brutal rise and fall of his
lash speeded up ki-gor felt a spurt of
anger as he realized the man meant to
spur past and leave him to face the blacks
alone the white lord sheered off his
steps slowing

  pull up he roared or by the gods
ill let them have you

  with the pygmies coming up behind
them ki-gor knew that a brief show of
fight would suffice to turn the ochari
ki-gors threat inspired a strange and un-
expected reaction in the horseman a bab-
ble of incoherent curses ripped from his
lips and he swung his horse straight at
the white lord

  ki-gors eyes were ice-grey slits as he
saw the madman meant to ride him down
the white lord swayed as he ran his
right arm whipping back and up the
shovel-bladed masai war spear poised for
a cast which would tumble the horse

  but the spent animal saved ki-gor the
trouble as it tried to make the abrupt turn
dictated by its master its trembling legs
gave way horse and rider came down in
a turning twisting heap and the black
who had been running with one arm
gripped to the saddle screamed in a high
feminine voice and was thrown off to
the side

  ki-gor in that moment received a dou-
ble shock as the huge-shouldered rider
dove through the air the jungle man saw
the whole of his body for the first time
the high grass had previously blocked off
a view of any more than his chest and
head the strange horseman was legless
his massive torso ended in two leather
stumps

  and the black who screamed was a
young girl her slim naked body red-
slashed where grass and thorn had torn
her during her flight

  when the horseman hit the ground he
mowed through the grass head first for
a good ten yards grating to a halt almost
at ki-gors feet he lay still his face a
mass of small cuts blood streaming from
his nose and mouth his eyes rolled back
in his head and he breathed in hard con-
vulsive gasps his whip remained tightly
gripped in his hand

  the girl was lost to view in the grass
but her weak whinnies of fear told ki-
gor she lived the horse threshed twice
and lay still its neck broken in the fall
ki-gor instantly regretted his harsh words
to the man a helpless cripple choking
with fear couldnt be held as accountable
as a normal man

  a yell of triumph went up from the
ochari like bounding cats they moved
in to strike

  they had caught glimpses of the fair-
skinned warrior who ran ahead of the
pygmies but this area was far from ki-
gors usual range and it did not occur to
them that it was the white lord who
opposed them the two leading blacks
split apart one turning to block away ki-
gor while the other raced on to slay the
unconscious horseman

  the white lord wasted no time on
words the ochari were a lawless crew
forever raiding and plundering weaker
tribes heeding no authority but their own
fierce chieftain


jungle stories

  as the painted warrior came leaping
over the dead horse his spear raised for
the cast he got a clear view of the bronzed
giant hurtling toward him the blacks
eyes widened as he recognized his foe and
surprise stayed his hand a fraction too
long ki-gor was in against him with the
speed of a striking cobra

  the white lord was merciful even in
his wrath instead of stabbing with his
razor-sharp masai spear he swung it like
a club smashing it flat against the side of
the mans head the native gave a queer
burbling grunt and fell backward on the
stiffening horse

  ki-gor whirled grim-faced and cold
judging as he turned the distance and
speed of the other native the great spear
was a dark blur in his hand so swiftly
did he whip it high and send it knifing
across the top of the tall grass

  the black was within two paces of the
legless man his weapon raised for the
death blow when ki-gors spear caught
him in the right shoulder it lifted him off
his feet and whirled him head over heels

the jungle man did not wait to watch
the effect of his cast two natives he
could handle but now that he had only
his knife the six warriors coming up
would make short work of him he raced
to the unconscious white man lifted him
in his arms and headed back toward the
pygmies the man was unexpectedly
heavy his thick body roped and swollen
with muscles his arms as large as the
average mans thigh

  even in his haste ki-gor was struck
by the mans ugliness every visible inch
of his body except for his face was cov-
ered with tattooing and his face was
twisted and brutish his over-sized head
was shaved revealing an oddly pointed
skull his nose was a predatory beak and
his eyes were close-set beneath beetling
brows

  ki-gor heard the crunch of dry grass
and the hurt exhausted whimpering of
the girl and- ran toward the sounds he
came on her so suddenly he almost tripped
she was crawling through the grass to
the white mans aid ki-gor was amazed
that the ugly brute in his arms could
command such loyalty from the girl

  when he saw her he knew she was too

weak to run since ki-gor could not
carry them both he decided to stand and
try to protect them though he knew how
hopeless his efforts would be if the ochari
continued their mad rush there was no
sound now from the pygmies and since
the grass completely swallowed their small
bodies he could not judge whether they
were close enough to reach him in time

  the white lord dropped the man be-
side the girl lie still and ill try to
draw the ochari away from you he said
quickly

  then he spun and drew his long knife
he ran toward the ochari cutting off at
an angle to pull them away from the
couple ki-gor was ordinarily silent in
battle but now he spat insults at the war-
riors as loudly and scornfully as any
native

  dangos sons of dangos foul eaters
of carrions

  he baited the ochari with all the choice
invective gathered in a lifetime of associa-
tion with those masters of the insult the
pygmies shrilling their rage the blacks
swung toward him a spear plunged past
his ear the whirr of its passage a thin
whisper of death

  a black his face hideously distorted
with hate came at ki-gor with long
reaching bounds the warrior gripped his
spear with both hands braced for the
shock of the cruel point ripping upward
to disembowel the white lord for an in-
stant it appeared the jungle man would
fling himself directly on the point he
looked like a sure target for the black

  but the white lord as soon as the
man lunged twisted wraith-like before
the blow he slid past the spear a quick
side chop of his knife helping to send the
shaft grating harmlessly past his hip be-
fore the black was aware he had missed
ki-gor rocketed against him

  the impact lifted the heavy warrior like
a rag doll and threw him back against the
spear of the man behind him by the time
the black screamed ki-gor had cut away
to the side using the bodies of the two
entangled men to block the other four
natives only his phenomenal speed and
agility kept him from death

  the blacks sprayed on either side of
him and as their spears lifted he knew at
least one of the four casts would be good

he had occupied them led them away
from the hidden couple but now his life
was to be forfeited

  he is mine snarled a lean tall war-
rior his eyes gleaming with the knowledge
that he could not miss the other three
held back their spears waiting

  haiiee he screamed in an ecstasy of
hate and the muscles of his back were
wriggling eels beneath the ebony skin his
throwing arm tensed the wrist tight-
swollen as he started the deadly throw

  then he gave a queer rigid leap reel-
ing sideways in the air his spear drooped
unthrown in a hand that no longer had
any strength his legs carried on with
their running motion he fell jerkily into
the grass the only sound he made was
an eerie gurgling

  a pygmy war cry splintered the air as
the ochari leader went down from every
side spurted the small black warriors their
terrible blowguns pressed to their lips the
ochari had delayed too long tricked by
the utter silence with which the pygmies
had made their approach

  the tall warriors had no need to see
ngeesos men to know they were lost
more than the most deadly poisonous
snake they feared the venom-tipped darts
of the pygmies

  mercy pleaded a grey-faced native
dropping to his knees his spear falling
forgotten to the ground

  a dik-dik deer could not have passed
through that ring of trigger-tense pygmies
and lived

  peace mercy echoed the wavering
cries

  at ngeesos harsh command the pyg-
mies froze where they stood their lips
cupped about their blowguns their breath-
ing cautious and shallow so that at every
moment they were ready to puff the darts
on their way

  for those who would kill ki-gor
there is no mercy ngeeso spat in con-
tempt you had fair warning to turn
away now you shall die the death you
willed for the white lord and your stink-
ing bodies will lie here to feed your
brothers the scavengers

  believe us o great ones quavered
one of the ochari we did not know him
for the white lord

  faugh the disgusted ngeeso snorted

at the weak lie

  let us live begged another we will
be your slaves we will serve you faith-
fully

  my people keep no slaves the pygmy
leader declared but enough of this sniv-
eling the time of your death is come
his lips went to his blowgun the
pygmy code was hard and unyielding he
had purposely delayed slaying the men for
a few moments so they might taste re-
morse to the fullest for their attempt on
his friends life there was no softness
in ngeese where ki-gor was concerned

but now the white lord who also had
been netted by the circle of pygmies
spoke up wait he ordered dead men
give little information i would know how
these cowards come to be so far from
home and why they would murder a leg-
less man and his servants

  ngeeso hesitated and then reluctantly
lowered his blowgun he plucked a knife
from the rawhide strand which supported
his breechclout balanced it in his hand it
was his way of submitting to ki-gors
wishes without losing face

  you heard the white lord he said
fiercely i will split the tongue of the first
who lies

  the ochari were terrified of ngeeso
and realizing that their slender chance to
live depended on winning ki-gors favor
they talked freely the white lord was
known to be merciful to prisoners

  the legless one broke faith with us
stuttered the warrior who had been the
first to surrender he came to us with
many presents saying if we would heed
his counsel we could all be rich in cattle
ivory and slaves but when our chief re-
fused to agree to his demands for war-
riors and authority he grew sullen and
would not go on with the plan then one
morning we awoke to find that he had
fled taking five of our tatoga slaves with
him our chief commanded that we find
and kill him and so we have come many
marches on his trail we have cut down
all except the girl and him

  ki-gor questioned the blacks further on
the supposed plan which would have made
them rich but they said they knew none
of the details

  ki-gor smiled bleakly it is the tato-


jungle stories

gas place not ours to pass judgment on
them send two hands of your men on
with them to the tatoga kraal have them
tell chief nonooko we will bring the girl
and the white man later after their hurts
have been given treatment at tom parsons
post

  the chief would be pleased to get the
ochari prisoners and ki-gor was
anxious to gain the goodwill of the old
man the tatoga were a large and vigor-
ous tribe and the whole purpose of ki-
gors trek was to bind them to the pact of
peace into which he gradually was draw-
ing all the larger tribes

  the tatoga had many legends of a time
long ago when they had ruled a vast ter-
ritory and this vague memory of former
greatness made them hold aloof from their
neighbors

  ki-gor knew that this pride would some-
day cause trouble

  the white lord had never been friendly
with the tatoga messengers he sent invit-
ing nonooko to peace councils with the
masai and pygmies returned with polite
evasions from the wary old chifetain so
now ki-gor came himself at the time of
the tatogas most important occasion the
celebration in honor of the dread god
momba-ngar

  this will put nanooko in our debt
ki-gor explained to ngeeso it will
guarantee us a hearing

  he pointed out where the pygmies would
find the two wounded ochari and the one
he had knocked senseless with his spear
the only casualty was the leader the
other three would recover as the prison-
ers carrying their wounded were herded
off toward the kraal ki-gor reclaimed his
spear and strode back to his two new
charges

  he found helene had come down from
the slope with a gourd of water and was
washing the dirt from the girls cuts the
ugly man was still unconscious

you wont let him die pleaded the
native girl when she saw ki-gor

  she possessed unusual beauty for a na-
tive beauty according to the white mans
standards she was slim with firm deli-
cately formed breasts a long tapering
waist and the sensuous hips of a dancer
her legs were long and straight but it

was her color that was most unusual it
was a deep golden brown like richly
creamed coffee

  she lay on her side her body glisten-
ing from the water with which helene
had washed her there was more in her
voice than a mere plea for a man who had
been kind to her

  again ki-gor was struck with wonder
that this ugly helpless man could inspire
such feelings in the girl

  it may be serious warned helene
he hasnt stirred

  well do our best for him promised
ki-gor tom parson runs a trading post
a few miles from here he understands
such things and has many medicines well
take him there

  he prepared to start

  the saddle the girl said urgently
we must take it he can do nothing with-
out it she rose painfully to her feet and
struggled toward the dead horse

  ki-gor took over the job from the sore-
muscled girl and uncinched the saddle it
was an oddly made leather affair with a
kind of harness which fitted about the
lower part of the legless mans body one
of the straps had broken when the horse
fell enabling the fellow to get clear

  but ki-gor was most intrigued by the
curved highly-polished piece of wood
fastened to the saddle

  whats this he asked the girl as he
examined the implement

  a throwing stick she replied it is
much finer than the ones used by my peo-
ple this stick if it misses comes back to
its users hand he had more but he used
them up as he did his bullets trying to
keep the ochari away

  her face hardened her eyes like murky
flame as she spoke of the long chase

  they were like a pack of dingos hang-
ing on our heels night and day she re-
membered this morning they knew we
had little left to fight with they attacked
at dawn and only three of us got away
alive

  her tawny face was cold cruel

  ki-gor thought then of the black the
white man had beaten away from the
horse and left to die how did the girl
feel about that

  it was better he should die than the
white one she replied coldly

for even an eccentric man

tom parson acted queerly when the
sweating pygmies laid their burden on the
warped table in his trading room he
stared fixedly at the vast tattooed bulk of
the legless man not moving a muscle for
the space of a minute then gone sud-
denly white he whirled on ki-gor

  why bring him to me he cried an-
grily what do you expect me to do

  he could have been drunk because a
half empty bottle of gin and a fly-rimmed
glass stood beside the chair he had been
occupying but night or day a similar bot-
tle and glass usually was within arms
reach of parson its hard to judge the
degree of a mans sobriety when youve
never really seen him sober -

  hewas hurt trying to help five ta-
toga slaves escape their ochari masters
ki-gor said quietly knowing the trader
was dependent on the goodwill of the
tatoga

  parson walked to the door spat out into
the dust he was a small thin man stooped
and frail he was garbed in a loose pair
of white duck pants bunched in large folds
at the waist by a tightly buckled belt he
was barefooted and he wore no shirt

  take him downriver to the settlement
he said tautly making an effort to control
himself theyll know there how to treat
him

  but thats a weeks trip by fast canoe
protested helene he might never sur-
vive it

  no matter said parson in a clipped
unsympathetic tone then as though he
abruptly realized how callous he sounded
he turned half-pleading i can treat cuts
maybe a broken leg but i dont know
anything about internal injuries hes
probably crushed some way hell be sure
to die if you depend on me to treat him

  he turned his head his glance stealing
back to the injured man furtive and
guilty

  the white lords face grew expression-
less but a new watchfulness came into his
manner as though his senses were explor-
ing feeling for a hidden thing which hov-
ered in the room

  what kind of a man are you to refuse
even to see whether you can do any-

thing helene said angrily certainly
you can look at him we dont expect
miracles only ordinary decency then if
he dies no one will blame you

 parson brushed a hand nervously
through his thin faded remnants of hair
he appeared to be undergoing some inner
struggle

  i guess youre right he said after a
long hesitation no one can blame me
there were pale blotches in his drink-
mottled face

  he went slowly toward the legless man
his tongue nervously flicking his dry lips
his hands hovered uncertainly for a sec-
ond then he bent over the man began
to go over him inch by inch to ki-gor
and the pygmies there was nothing unusual
in the way parson checked- the fellow
they took it for granted that he had a
skill above theirs in such matters

  but helene saw that parsons fingers
awkward and fumbling at first gradually
seemed to gain an intelligence of their
own fascinated she moved close behind
the trader she had seen trained doctors
at work before and there was no denying


jungle stories

the trained intent way in which parson
checked the patient who had been forced
on him

  this odd frail man who had lost him-
self in the congo had all the earmarks
of a trained physician she looked more
closely at his face seeing the fine features
lying blurred beneath the mottled skin

  what upheaval in his life could cause
him to voluntarily bury himself in this
sun-baked post eking out an existence by
trading cheap cloth and trinkets for the
few marketable objects brought to him
by the black men

  standing so near helene could not help
but see the legless mans eyes flutter open
and stare up at the person working over
him his lids fluttered weakly as he fought
to hold them open and focus his gaze

  abruptly his mouth quirked faintly his
lips curled as though trying to form a
word but the effort was too much for
him he slid back into unconsciousness

  parson stood looking down at the hurt
man his hands were still held as they
had been when the mans eyes first opened
the traders body blocked away ki-gor
and ngeesos view so that they hadnt
witnessed the flicker of life displayed by
the patient

  what do you think asked ki-gor
understanding from the traders attitude
that he was finished

  i dont know im not sure answered
parson hollowly hed be a tough one
to kill id say but that fall may do it
helene had moved away by the time
parson turned and walked over to his
chair he let himself down on the edge
of the chair gingerly his hand groping
for the gin bottle there were beads of
sweat on his forehead he tilted the bottle
then let it run down his throat in great
gulps his puckered face showing no
pleasure in the taste

  leave him here with me a few days
he said ill do what i can

  good ki-gor declared warmly
well stay around too were several
days early for the tatoga celebration
parson wiped his hands on his pants
staring at the legless man

the god of death he murmured
huskily the dark god keeper of un-
counted sorrows fountain of all evil
whats that asked ki-gor wonder-

ing at the cause of this strange outburst
parson looked up and blinked as though
he hadnt realized he had spoken aloud

  i was thinking of the tatoga celebra-
tion he hastily explained apparently
you dont know the real reason it is held
in typically human fashion instead of
giving thanks to one of the gods who do
good things for them the tatoga hold
their greatest celebration to pay homage-
and thereby to impress and placate-their
worst god momba-ngar i was merely
remembering a few of his many titles
he tilted the bottle and drank again
helene glanced questioningly at the white
lord was a man whose mind moved so
irrationally capable of giving medical care
to anyone

  shouldnt you be doing something for
him helene ventured uncertainly ges-
turing toward the patient

  eh parson roused momentarily from
his moody reflections oh yes but ive
got to think what the proper thing is i
should do then his mind reverted to
the tatoga celebration again

  momba-ngar he repeated the name
several times to himself and on his tongue
it had an ugly sound you know ki-
gor ive heard it said that men fashion
their gods in their own likenesses i dont
believe that i think scholars have got the
cart before the horse

  he squinted at ki-gor his expression
deadly serious

  the gods are the unchanging quantity
and i think they do all the fashioning
he declared and occasionally it suits
their fancy to fashion a man in their
exact likeness and to bestow on him cer-
tain of their powers

  ki-gor tried to smile but his manner
betrayed his impatience

  you doubt that dont you ki-gor
said parson well after you get a look
at the image of momba-ngar you wont
that man on the table is his exact like-
ness he ducked his tongue the god
who has no need of legs because  all men
in their time will seek him out of their
own accord

  parson got up shaking his head to
emphasize the importance of what he had
said

  yes sir he continued and its the
furthest thing in the world from a coin-
slave of the jackal priestess



cidence which most fools would call it
its a carefully planned fact he walked
toward the room where he slept but
theres one thing a god will never dupli-
cate in his likeness thats the gods own
immortality the god wont ever carry his
little joke whether good or bad that far
and we can damn well be thankful for
that selfish reservation

they could hear him muttering to
himself in the next room as he gath-
ered up the materials he needed for the
legless man helene shook her head and
whispered to her ki-gor

  its a shame to see him talk like a
fool she said when you realize what
he must have been at one time he still
shows evidences of great skill despite
what hes done to himself

  the white lord fingered his chin
thoughtfully he uses too many words
he said simply i get lost before i can
find his meaning

  the only pygmy who understood any
english at all was ngeeso and he knew
just a smattering of simple words he had
listened admiringly but without under-
standing to parsons flow of language

  he is a great wizard he commented
in an awed voice to drink so much of
the burning water and walk without stag-
gering

  apparently the tatoga girl was also
both impressed and frightened by parson
not until he left the room did she creep
forward to stare at the legless man the
moment parson reappeared she retreated
to a corner again and during the next
three days and nights while parson drank
ever larger quantities of gin and minis-

tered to his patient the girl hovered al-
ways in the room silent and increasingly
distressed for the legless man failed to
come out of his coma

  late the third night the girl slipped
from the room without a word and dis-
appeared when her absence was dis-
covered it was found the legless mans
saddle was also gone

  she has given him up muttered
ngeeso and small wonder with him
growing more limp every day hes fin-
ished

  but if parson thought the same thing
he gave no evidence of it he continued
to sit in his chair drinking and muttering
seldom stirring except to work over the
patient hunched there bearded and dirty
from his unceasing vigil he waved away
anyone who came in and tried to relieve
him

  but by the fifth night though he in-
sisted everyone else go to bed he was so
exhausted he dozed constantly ki-gor
slept in the next room and twice before
midnight he awakened and went in to
find the trader snoring the patients con-
dition was unchanged so the jungle lord
didnt disturb parson then toward dawn
ki-gor awakened a third time roused
from his light sleep by a noise in the
trading room

  he started to get up but after listening
a bit he decided it was only the trader
shuffling about and relaxed at daybreak
he was brought leaping from his bed
by a hoarse cry from parson running
into the room he found the trader almost


fungle stories

hysterical pointing with a shaking hand
to the empty table

  hes gone he cried do you hear
me hes gone-disappeared

  parson tried to take a step toward the
door but his legs gave under him and
he would have fallen but for ki-gor
the white lord could feel how violently
the man was trembling

  i tried to keep awake he wailed
but i must have dozed its my fault
i failed

  ki-gor was bewildered at the way par-
son took on he helped him to sit down
and gently but firmly held him in the
chair

  youve nothing to blame yourself
about he explained he cant have gone
far he probably roused enough to get
off the table and being dazed and sick
he crawled out of the room without know-
ing what he was doing

  ki-gors words fell on deaf ears par-
son was inconsolable helene had come
up by then and she tried to explain that
if the fellow could actually get away from
the house it proved the traders treatment
was successful

  why you know a man in his condi-
tion couldnt get many yards away she
stated ki-gor and the pygmies will find
him within a few minutes

  theres no use to search i tell you
moaned parson hes gone completely
gone this is the finish for me

  seeing that the only way he could quiet
the trader was to quickly produce the
legless man ki-gor called the pygmies
from their encampment a hundred yards
away from the house and set them to
searching the hard-packed earth about
the post trodden solid by countless bare
feet gave no hint of the direction the
hurt man had taken but the pygmies
were so confident they would find him
close by that they were unworried about
the lack of spoor

  like nervous brown dogs they circled
through the brush they were the jungles
best trackers and ki-gor did not think
it even necessary to join them he stood
by the post waiting for the cry which
would tell of the legless mans discovery
but as the minutes drained away the
noise of the searching pygmies receded
further and further into the jungle and

a puzzled rfrown grew oil the white lords
face

  ki-gor joined the search combing the
area with the care of a hunting leopard
a grimness was in his manner for where
the pygmies had searched for a man the
white lord searched for the track of a
flesh-eating animal powerful enough to
carry off a man he was convinced that
a jungle prowler had come on the dazed
patient

  after a fruitless day-long search he
returned to the post without a single
definite clue to all appearances the sick
man had disappeared into thin air but
ki-gor knew how devilishly clever a
python or a hungry cat could be

  the killer will come back ki-gor
warned you must have walls about the
post animals grow bold after an easy
kill he was thinking how often par-
son was alone his senses fogged with
drink

  yes he will come back the trader

said listlessly

  to repay you for your trouble the
white lord offered well put up a stock-
ade for you tomorrow

  parson looked away into the deepening
night across the jungle came the angry
trumpeting of an elephant near at hand
a lion belligerently answered the chal-
lenge

  why trouble he muttered against
momba-ngar there is no defense except
whats in a man himself who should
know that better than me his bloodshot
eyes swept the empty table and after
today i dont really care any more

  instead of sobering him ki-gor thought
the tragedy had had the opposite effect
it was peculiar that he should take so
hard the death of a man whom he had
callously refused to treat in the begin-
ning but then parson hadnt acted very
rationally in any regard

  look ki-gor pointed out we feel
as badly as you do about losing that fel-
low but its done now and the best we
can do is see that the same thing isnt
repeated again how about your getting
some sleep and well save the talking for
tomorrow

  you mean well ki-gor parson said
thickly but sleep is no protection either
neither sleep nor walls nor anything a
slave of the jackal priestess



man can build you see theres a weak-
ness in men which makes them go out
to momba-ngar of their own accord no
matter what defenses they build they al-
ways leave a secret door through which
they can one day slip out to him he
rubbed his hand across his sweat-damp-
ened face thats why he doesnt have
to have any legs he doesnt have to hunt
down men in time theyll search him
out themselves

  he stared for a moment at ki-gor in
dead seriousness and then his lids closed
and he crumpled slowly back in his chair
when ki-gor lifted him he was snoring
he didnt awaken all night but the white
lord several times was tempted to rouse
him for parson rolled and turned un-
ceasingly moaning and crying out in his
sleep ki-gor couldnt help but wonder at
the terror which stalked his dreams the
effects of his heavy drinking and the
shock of losing his patient had so shaken
him mentally that he apparently confused
the legless man and momba-ngar the
tatoga god as being one and the same

ill

chief nanooko had been a tall pow-
erful warrior in his youth but age
had eaten the flesh from his bones and
bent his once straight back in a land
where men die young he had seen the
great rains come and go so many times
that even he long since had lost the
measure of his years

  he received ki-gor in the great council
house with the faded shields and grinning
skulls of tatoga enemies he had van-
quished in his youth cluttering the cir-
cular thatch walls the men of his per-
sonal guard with their tailed shields of
lion-skin and their zebra-skin capes stood
like rooted trees every four yards about
the single large room a score of his
young wives their plump bodies gleaming
with oil sat about him

  and to his right apart from the other
women knelt the young woman ki-gor
had rescued from the ochari she was
to thfc others as a great tawny butterfly
to drab moths she was motionless her
head bowed respectfully but the effect
was that of the butterfly consciously dis-

-jungle stories-spring

playing its beauty her sensuousness
reached out through the room

  nanooko looked asleep as ki-gor ap-
proached him he slumped deep in a
huge bamboo chair his chin dropped on
his sunken chest his breathing so shallow
as to be hardly noticeable ki-gor in-
toned the customary flowery greetings and
praises and then in the lengthening silence
waited uncomfortably

  at last the lids slid upward in the
wrinkled face like charred points of
wood the old eyes watched him

  so you are the man who thought to
chain momba-ngar in sleep nanooko
suddenly accused

  ki-gor was too astonished to speak
he had come expecting a warm welcome
even gratitude for taking the tatogas
part against the ochari then out of
thin air he was stabbed with this ridiculous
charge

  hai you are surprised i know de-
clared the chieftain fool to think you
could hide your guilt greater fool to
think that when time after time without
end momba-ngar chooses to come among
his people that any man let alone a white
man could best him

  the primitive black men especially aged
leaders like nanooko who had known un-
limited authority throughout their lives
were often unpredictable ki-gor tried
to gather his wits this might be the tor-
tured attempt at humor of a ruler whose
most feeble sally invariably brought roars
of laughter from his subjects

  this is some joke of the mighty bull
elephant ki-gor inquired

  i never joke when i am about to sen-
tence a man to die the old one snapped

  the guards held their places as before
their eyes blank and unseeing but the
white lords trained glance saw how


jungle stories

their leg muscles stood out in stronger
relief how their fingers on the spears
whitened with tension they were ready
to spring at the faintest signal from their
chieftain

  something was wrong badly wrong
ki-gor was in real danger and his only
hope was to spar for time until he could
find out what this was all about he
thought of helene and the pygmies wait-
ing in the guest huts with no suspicion
of nanookos hostility the chieftain had
been clever his emissaries had welcomed
them in the friendliest manner swamp-
ing them with food and gifts

  perhaps you do not know me nanoo-
ko ki-gor said boldly and he attached
no titles now to the chieftains name i
do not die so easily i came in friendship
expecting to meet a chieftain of great
wisdom and honor

  he raised a slow accusing finger at
the old man

  instead i find a talking bird impris-
oned in a fine cage repeating with no mind
of its own the ridiculous words taught
it by others let me speak to the real
ruler of the tatoga let me speak to
the one who teaches the bird to utter its
words

  the lash of ki-gors words wrapped
around the shrunken frame stung it up-
right anger comes quick and hot to men
long accustomed to meek unquestioning
submission

  by the gods he quavered i alone
rule here no man dares call me a talk-
ing bird i add torture to your sentence
of death

  ki-gors laugh was harsh and mocking

  you speak threats old man he cried
but you are afraid to speak your false
charges to say out plainly what lying
thing it is you accuse me of doing aaaiii-
eee it would never do for your wives
and warriors to see how easily ki-gor
punctures with the truth this puffed-up
bladder of lies which someone has thrust
into your hand

  nanooko tottered to his feet shaking
with rage

  as he rose his warriors swayed for-
ward to smother the white lord with
their great numbers

  and so perfectly composed was the
jungle man that not one of those within

the council house guessed that within his
heart he was certain he had lost

  women and warriors ki-gor called
remember this day when nanooko was
called a weakling led by the nose into
injustice and he could not prove it other-
wise 

  hold hold shrilled the frothing old
leader to his guards bring in the wiz-
ards the elders and my captains this
dango shall get more than he bargained
for and when he crawls on his belly in
fear at the things i know against him
then shall he be given over to the ants
to be eaten until his bare bones gleam
in the sun

  nanooko fell back in his chair gasping
for breath he fluttered a hand weakly
at one of his wives and she pressed a
gourd of beer to his lips he drank- long
sucking draughts oblivious of the twin
sireams which foamed from the corners
of his mouth and splashed upon his skinny
chest by the time he was finished those
he had summoned stood in their appointed
places

  where is gita my chief wizard de-
manded the old man

a squat man with the face of a cheetah
leaped forward his rattling strings
of amulets and bones were disarranged
from the haste with which he had come
he held by the wrong end the wand he
used for smelling out wrong-doers

  what were the portents you spoke of
to me concerning momba-ngar  de-
manded nanooko of the wizard

  gitas eyes flicked the white lord
rested a moment on the serene face of
the girl who knelt to the right of the
chieftain and then he bowed low

  three dawns the sun rose like a wash
of blood he said without hesitation and
i came to you saying there were strange
voices in the wind voices of the long-dead
crying the name of momba-ngar

  and you thought on my words awhile
and then you bade me go to my hut and
call on the fathers of nanooko to tell the
meaning of this thing

  and lo it was as you said for your
fathers came to me in the night saying
momba-ngar came abroad in the land
smelling out the enemies of the tatoga
-his glance touched the white lord
slave of the jackal priestess



meaningfully-whether black or white
and your fathers said momba-ngar
would no longer be a stone image en-
shrined in the cave of death but would
be a god of flesh and blood come down
among us to lead us to glory and riches
gitas voice dropped away and he
stepped back as though finished nanooko
leaned forward impatiently

  yes yes he said irritably but what
about ki-gor

  the wizard expelled his breath slowly
as though reluctant to speak but the
white lord did not miss the slyness in
his face there was no doubting gita
had a role in some shrewd game against
the jungle man

  your fathers said a white man known
as ki-gor was trying even then to keep
momba-ngar from the tatoga gita said
softly they said he was the gods sworn
enemy and that to gain the good will of
the god we should not let him leave our
kraal alive they said momba-ngar
watched to see whether this ki-gor de-
ceived us with his false tongue

  as ki-gor listened his mind darted
back to tom parson mumbling drunkenly
about momba-ngar and he thought he
saw his first clue to the origin of this
foolish mumbo-jumbo what alcohol had
done for parson childish superstition and
the excitement of their coming celebration
had done for the tatoga the jungle man
had seen it happen before a tale based
on a true happening flew through the
jungle stretched and distorted by every
retelling until it lost all semblance of
truth

blacks had seen him bring the legless
man to the trading post unseen eyes

were often watching in the jungle and
a man without legs was novelty enough
to set native tongues to wagging after
that it had taken only the malice of the
wizard gita to twist the tale to ki-gors
disadvantage

  the witchdoctors in every part of the
congo hated the white lord because he
laughed at their vaunted magic and tried
to lighten the yoke of superstition they
fastened on the black men like some
evil guild they worked constantly to dis-
credit him

  now that he understood ki-gors ten-
sion eased the truth had been kept from
the old chieftain since the white lord
could prove his story by the pygmies
parson the ochari prisoners and the
tatoga girl who had been so loyal to
the legless man he could easily show up
the witchdoctor to save his own face
before his subjects nanooko would deal
severely with gita

  hai cried the old man triumphantly
what say you now white man

  i say i can see the serpent who poisons
your thoughts returned the white lord
hear the truth that you may judge
where the forked tongue lies

  and ki-gor told in full how he had
rescued the legless man acting out the
story in the native fashion the old chief-
tain motioned for his warriors to listen
so there was no interruption gita osten-
tatiously looked at the ceiling a doubting
smirk on his face

  as he finished the jungle man spread


jungle stories

his arms wide any of those who were
with me can tell that this is the truth
i saved the life of that girl give her leave
to speak

  nanookos chuckle was- the rustle of
dead leaves in the wind he looked around
the room to see whether any present yet
appreciated how cleverly he was handling
the white man

  ah he said it is not the custom
for a mere woman to be heard in tatoga
councils but nanooko is a generous man
so i will make an exception

  he crooked a finger at the girl she
crawled forward on hands and knees his
old eyes ran over her lissome body not
without appreciation

  sepah was the wife of my favorite
son the one who would have ruled after
me if the sleeping fever had not come
upon him he said a raiding party of
ochari captured her while she was still
mourning him her word i believe as
though it were my sons he touched
the girls head with a bony finger speak
my daughter he commanded gently

  sepah raised her head and looked into
the old mans face then ki-gor learned
the unexpected venom that lay buried in
her beauty

tt was momba-ngar himself who
x saved me o lord she said loudly
he toyed with the ochari leading them
on so they would fall into your hands
when he saw this ki-gor coming to
interfere he said there is a false one
an enemy who would keep me from the
tatoga and i will prove it to you 
she trembled and began to weep as
though overcome with emotion she raised
herself up so the old ma could see the
whole of her beauty astounded by her
lies ki-gor could only listen open-
mouthed

  the god told me she continued that
ki-gor would try with white mans juju
to cast a sleep upon him and thus keep
him a prisoner so i would know this
for the truth he let the white man think
he had triumphed and he played that he
was senseless and let himself be carried
to the traders house there the trader
put further poison in his veins to deepen
his sleep but just when they thought
they had the god in their power he

laughed at them and disappeared into the
night

  ki-gors face flushed with anger she
lies he accused bring the ochari pris-
oners i sent you they will tell how close
they were to killing this girl and the
legless man bring the pygmies without
telling them what transpires here and ask
them about their part in saving this
worthless woman

  nanookos eyelids were closed he
spoke without opening them spoke in his
dry dead voice

  you apparently know that the ochari
are safely dead he intoned had he been
less confused ki-gor would have guessed
before he spoke that the secret plotters
would have silenced the prisoners na-
nooko went on they died in agony soon
after their arrival slain by the unseen
hand of momba-ngar and the pygmies
of course are in league with you so
their words are nothing

  ki-gor was trapped by lies and des-
perately as he squirmed the trap grew
tighter suddenly he remembered parson
the tatoga had known the trader for
many years and would believe him he
knew he could count on parson to tell
the truth

  you have traded with parson for
many many moons he hurriedly told
nanooko no one has ever known him
to say an untrue thing bring him and
let him disprove this girls story

  you make a harder death for your-
self with every delay nanooko promised
grimly but it shall be as you ask he
nodded at gita bring in the man who
trades

  ki-gor immediately sensed another
trick and he was right the witchdoctor
had planned too carefully for him gita
had taken the precaution of bringing par-
son secretly to the kraal under armed
guard and had seen that he was given
more than enough to drink he had two
of his assistants lead the trader in sup-
porting him to keep him from falling
parson was blind drunk

  the girl saw you stick shining poison
darts into the legless one and each time
his sleep grew deeper said nanooko
to the trader you meant to keep him
chained in sleep is this not so 

  parson swayed unsteadily in the grip
slave of the jackal priestess



 of the two blacks his face a dull grey
 with such abruptness that he almost
 pitched forward he shook his head up
 and down in assent

    i dont deny it he said thickly sure

 i shot im full of the stuff hes full of
 evil when ki-gor brought im in uncon-
 scious i thought i could do it but like
 a fool i let im get away

   his voice died away to a murmur as
 he went on talking to himself ki-gor
 confronted parson thinking he might
 reach into that fogged mind long enough
 to make the trader realize that by his
 statement he also was condemning himself
 to death

   think what youre saying parson he
 warned tell them the truth tell them
 that you were treating him-trying to
 make him well

   parson studied him blearily i fooled
 you because you trusted me he muttered
 but the girl she didnt trust me she
 saw how every time i punched im with
 the hyperdermic he sank lower i thought
 she was too dumb to understand but they
 fool you these blacks about what they
 know sure i meant to kill im my mis-
 take was in trying to be clever in trying
 to do it so gradual no one would catch
 on

   ki-gor dropped his hands from par-
 son shocked to think that the mild little
 trader would have deliberately tried to
 kill a helpless man then as he remem-
 bered that actually parson hadnt killed
 the fellow he tried once more to rally
 the traders wits

   but you didnt kill him he cried
 tell them the truth that you dozed off
 and some animal got him

   parson wagged his hand in disagree-
 ment sagging back against the two na-
 tives

   no animal got im he declared hes
 the devil himself somehow he got outta
 there under his own power and hes lying
 around in the bush somewhere right now
 gathering his strength and laughing at
 me youll see hell be back to taunt
 me

   nanooko motioned to the guards and
 they led parson out of the council house

   ive been more than just with you
 ki-gor said nanooko ive given you
 every chance you asked to prove your

 innocence and in every instance youve
 failed ive done this because your name
 in the jungle is great and i wish all men
 to know that you were given justice

  he paused his lips pursed over his
almost toothless gums nanookos anger
had faded he was pleased with his show
of benevolence now that he had been so
thoroughly proved right in his accusa-
tions

  are you ready to admit your crime
against momba-ngar he questioned

  ki-gor was silent so long that the
spectators waited breathlessly feeling at
last he meant to make a clean breast of
his deed but he did not answer the
question directly

ou are above all other chieftains
x in shrewdness ki-gor said quietly
you are indeed a just man the com-
pliments guaranteed that nanooko would
not interrupt him to your credit also
i would say that more times than any
man in the tribe have you looked in wor-
ship upon momba-ngar in the cave of
death your legends say that one day
momba-ngar will turn back into flesh
and blood to lead the tatoga and on every
visit you have looked to see if the change
has come

  softened by the flattery nanooko nod-
ded approvingly i have done that he
said proudly i know his look better
than that of my sons


jungle stories

  ki-gor drew a long breath he was
at the end of his rope this was a last
blind gamble he took in the hope of sav-
ing himself the wizard gita seemed to
sense that the white lord was up to some
stratagem and his bird-bright eyes grew
watchful

  is it not true then o wise ruler
ki-gor demanded loudly that if momba-
ngar has turned himself to flesh and
blood he will no longer sit as a stone
image in the cave of death the question
caught the old man unprepared momba-
ngar cannot walk the jungle as your
wizard claims and yet at the same time
sit unchanged in the cave is this not
true 

  why yes that is true the old man
frowningly admitted stroking his chin
thoughtfully but what has that to do
with you

  just this snapped ki-gor before
gita could understand what he was about
if the stone god still sits in the cave
then he has not come back as flesh and
blood and if he has not come back then
i could not have tried to slay him

  he paused an instant for the old man
to digest his words then he darted a
finger straight at the wizard he didnt
know for sure whether gita had removed
the stone god but from the expression
on the witchdoctors face he surmised he
hadnt

  let us all go together to the cave of
death he proposed if the image is not
there then i will confess my guilt

  gita leaped before the chieftain crying
that the white man was trying to blind
them with his deceptions ki-gor was
very close to the wizard and his right
arm snaked out and closed about the mans
neck before a single guard could move

  what do you fear gita he roared
either momba-ngar is alive or he isnt
you say he lives so let us go and see
his steel fingers in the brief interval
they circled gitas throat managed to
exert enough pressure to insure the witch-
doctors silence for a time gita choked
and gasped but he could not manage a
word after ki-gor released him

  the network of wrinkles on nanookos
forehead deepened and he sucked ner-
vously at his lower lip he motioned a
wife to hold another gourd of beer to

his mouth and while he drank his sunken
eyes peered over the rim first at ki-gor
and then at his chief wizard all the
while his frown deepened

  then abruptly he pushed the beer gourd
away we will go and see he said
softly yes when the noonday heat is
passed we will go

          iv

anooko traveled as a great lord
should a beat of drums went be-
fore him so the jungle should know of
his coming shoulder to shoulder about
him massed the tall men of his guard
fierce hard warriors who would have
stood and died before a rhinos sudden
charge to protect their chieftain

  the bush about the procession quivered
with the passage of disturbed animals
brilliant-hued birds cried harsh protests
and spun away to safer haunts and in
the trees above the marching men bands
of monkeys kept pace like profane urchins

  but to all these barbaric trappings
nanooko was oblivious he lay sleeping
his head rolling with the sway of the litter
on which he was carried he saw nothing
of the broad worn path which led to the
cave of death the effort of the primitive
trial had exhausted him

  this sight emphasized to ki-gor how
feeble was nanookos grasp on the reins
of power other hands were reaching slyly
but with stern resolution for those reins
that was what lay behind the ridiculous
charges saddled on him those who sought
the power knew ki-gors reputation and
feared that he would interfere

  the path wound through a grey ancient
grove of baobab trees and opened into
a broad damp clearing on the far side
of the clearing rose the moss and fern-
covered face of a bluff from unnumbered
places on the cliff started small springs

  but from the top of the cliff in the
very center flung a shimmering sheet of
water a hundred feet across it hurtled
down to shatter into spray on a great
flat rock and then gush off on either
side into a deep clear pool which pro-
tected the bluff like a moat the flat rock
lay over the pool joining cliff and clear-
ing as would a lowered drawbridge

  the roar of the water awakened nanoo-
slave of the jackal priestess



ko he raised his hand and the procession
halted he was helped from his litter
and together with all his men knelt facing
the cliff by their actions ki-gor knew
this must be the place holy to momba-
ngar but his eyes could discover no
cave holding the gods image

  while he was puzzling the wizard gita
crawled forward on his knees to the edge
of the fall above the sound of the water
ki-gor could catch faint snatches of his
chanting to his surprise gitas voice
began to grow clearer and then ki-gor
saw the reason

  the flow of water was lessening as
the man chanted as though his words
were drying up the fall it began to lose
force dwindling until only a few dying
streams spattered from the cliff and re-
vealed where it had been covered by the
waterfall was the cave of death the
dread place of momba-ngar

  one by one the heads of the kneeling
warriors came up and they stared at that
cold perpetually wet place in the rock
each of them saw but they held their
tongues gita turned nervously to steal
a look at nanooko but of all that crowd
the old chieftain alone as yet had seen
nothing his eyes were too dim to make
out objects at any distance

  nanooko got painfully to his feet and
steadying himself on the arm of a guard
walked out to the slab of rock which
bridged the way to the cavern he squinted
a few moments and then spoke without
turning

  this is very strange gita he said
in his slow dead voice what have you
to say

  the wizards mouth opened and closed
but his mind had no word to put in his
throat a greyness seeped into his face
and he grew increasingly disturbed

  limned against the darkness of the
cavern was the image of the legless god
he sat there life-sized carved of a queer
brown stone traced over with tiny veins
of color the image was only vaguely
seen for besides the greenish patches of
fungus which mottled its body the whole
figure was wreathed in twisting veils of
mist which rolled from the cavern

  there was undeniable evil in every line
in the very posture of the squat huge-
shouldered image and its eerie setting

lent added power to the effect ki-gor bet-
ter understood now the grasp which
momba-ngar had on the tatoga and he
saw too how with the use of very little
imagination parson could compare the leg-
less man to this savage deity in looks

  but with his own life at stake ki-gor
quickly turned his thoughts from the idol
to nanooko how o great bull of the
tatoga he demanded can i be guilty
of offending a god come to life when you
see with your own eyes that momba-
ngar sits unchanged as he has since the
world was young

  nanooko was trapped by ki-gors sim-
ple logic because of his whole-hearted
faith in gita and sepah he had allowed
his captains his chief officials and most
of his bodyguard to come out to witness
his humbling of ki-gor had he brought
only a few trusted men he could have
gotten out of his embarrassing position
by dispatching ki-gor and hushing up
the whole matter but his boast of being
the most just of chieftains was at test
before too many of his people and he
would lose face if he gave the white
lord anything but justice

  he growled deep in his throat and stared
at gita his expression plainly saying
you got me into this now get me out
the wizard began to sweat and for all
his cunning he could only sputter vague
nothings

  i-i know not what to say the old
chieftain finally began to ki-gor and
there was the look of death in his eyes
as he peered at gita my word is my
word and  

but before he could finish the state-
ment setting ki-gor free sepahs
slim full-breasted figure broke from the
mass of warriors and sped up on the
rock beside him

  the god rouses she shouted hys-
terically then she flung herself down on
her belly on the wet stone shrilling aloud
the name momba-ngar ffenziedly
she began to wriggle forward toward the
mist-wreathed image

  nanooko reeled around unsteadily and
tottered after her straining his blurred
eyes to learn what it was she saw an
awed fearful murmur went up from the
crowd and ki-gor with a muffled ex-


jungle stories

clamation of disbelief saw his last chance
for life snatched away

  in the heart of the mists the stone
image stirred raising high its heavy arms
the eyes had opened and stared yellow
and luminous at the cowering black men
the ugly bullet-head turned with slow
deliberation first to one side and then to
the other

  go down on your face nanooko
thundered the image when you approach
the god of death

  struck through with fright the old man
gave a high wavering whinny and threw
his brittle bones into the wet he was so
overcome by the magnitude of the thing
he was witnessing that he could only lie
gasping as one man the tatoga warriors
followed their chieftains example

  momba-ngar is come back to lead
the tatoga rumbled the voice from the
cavern

  ki-gor was as startled as the blacks
for a moment for all of his scorn of
native juju queer prickles ran up and
down his spine reason told him it could
not be but his eyes saw the stone figure
come to life but when the god spoke
ki-gor immediately knew the truth

  the god spoke the tatoga tongue with
a white mans accents the same accents
which had tinged the wild curses of the
legless horseman on the veldt when he
tried to ride the white lord down the
legless man himself was ki-gors enemy
this man whose life the white lord had
tried to save whom he had thought tragic-
ally dead

  ki-gor made no effort then to pierce
the web of treachery spun by the white
man and his assistants that could come
later a cold deadly anger shook him
he swore to himself that he would live
to smash whatever plan his loathsome
opponent sought to execute

  he tore his eyes away from the cavern
all about him the tatoga warriors lay
prostrate moaning and stealing glances at
the awful deity which spoke to them for
generations the tribe had looked forward
to the gods awakening and now they were
awe-struck

  for the first moment since he had
entered the council house that morning
the white lord was unguarded in his
desire to impress and frighten the old

chieftain the legless man had commanded
him to fall on his face not realizing that
nanookos followers would hasten to fol-
low suit

  before the legless man grasped his mis-
take ki-gor leaped over the bodies of his
guards and sped straight through the whole
pack of grovelling blacks heading for the
jungle he moved like an antelope his
feet barely seeming to touch the ground
as he strained to gain every last particle
of advantage from the surprise of his
move

  ki-gor escapes shrieked the legless
man in an abrupt departure from his god-
like demeanor up dangos stop him or
every one of you dies

 like maniacal ants the blacks swarmed
up from the ground ki-gor counted on
the confusion to protect him a second
longer he didnt deviate from his dhosen
path an inch as the blacks came up
around him he lowered his head and
plowed straight through them he was
near the outer fringe of the crowd and
since he bent low only those warriors
close by could see him

  an enraged water buffalo would have
struck with no more devastation he put
his head and shoulders into men in all
attitudes of rising the shivering power
of his charge scattering them to either
side sprawling and kicking as they fell
not knowing what had hit them he was
through all of them then except for two
blacks who had lingered behind their fel-
lows

  the two managed to stand upright in
time to see the great-thewed giant hurtling
at them but before they could collect
their senses enough to raise their spears
he dove at knee level at the nearest man
the fellow beat downward with his dou-
bled fists but the leopard swiftness of the
jungle man brought him in too fast for
the blacks slower reflexes

  ki-gor hit solidly swinging his body
broadside as a football blocker does the
natives legs held firm for a fraction then
he spun high screaming in pain as bone
and tendon ripped loose the white lord
hit flat on the ground but the layers of
muscle encasing his chest and belly ab-
sorbed the rocking blow like shock ab-
sorbers

  his spread fingers caught the earth
slave of the jackal priestess



before he had ceased sliding they dug
deep and he whirled himself about lash-
ing out with his feet at the second black
the man was coming in on him when
ki-gors heels exploded in his face the
warriors neck snapped with the sudden
explosive break of dry bamboo

  the native catapulted backward his legs
making loose wild motions by the time
he fell ki-gor had leaped past him and
was driving for the trees thirty yards
away but brief as the delay had been
it was long enough for the mass of war-
riors to shed their confusion they came
in long bounding leaps across the clear-
ing whipped by their of momba-ngar

ki-gor didnt look back his ears told
him how close was the race he ran
with death he poured his whole strength
into the effort of running a spear ripped
past him then two more the first arrow
sped dangerously close its passage a hot
burn against his arm

  then the trees were dead ahead and
the barbs were spanging into the wood
throwing splinters of bark fire touched
him twice against his thigh and he knew
his luck was running out as bowmen got
the range he gathered himself in a final
volcanic surge bounded over the nearest
cluster of baobab roots straining to get
around the monster tree so the trunk would
briefly shield him

  he cursed the blacks who had cut away
the brush about their holy place the wall
of liana bamboo and bramble which or-
dinarily would have grown there would
have given him safety missiles whipped
the air about him rattled against the
branches and still he lived to run

  then he was past the giant cluster of
roots he spun to the left turning to
bring the baobab tree at his back until
he could pierce deeper into the forest
with an exultant thrill he knew that an-
other step and he would be safe for once
in the jungle no man among the tatoga
could hope to catch him

  he lifted in the final bound which
would place him beyond reach of the mis-
siles and in that fleeting interval fate
turned its face away from him a heavy
spear caromed against the baobab tree
traveling at full tilt it ricocheted turn-
ing sideways in the air

  the haft of the spear just below the
point hit ki-gor across the forehead it
hit him with the force of a club ripped
viciously for a yard of its smooth-surfaced
length and still had force enough to spin
off at a crazy angle

  ki-gor never knew what hit him the
sky exploded in his face disintegrated in
a dazzling burst of light like a thousand
bursting comets then abruptly total dark-
ness engulfed him and he went down in
the nerveless drop of a poled ox he lay
in a limp huddle not hearing the fierce
elated cry with which the tatoga marked
his fall

  but his was the instinct of a wild
creature and it was this instinct this
impulse welling out of bone and heart
and flesh which came to the fore now
when all other senses were dormant as
a buck felled by a bullet will come to its
feet to run again so did ki-gor suddenly
claw drunkenly to his hands and knees
his mind had no part in the action

  instinct cried to him to flee ripped
through the pain and darkness with a ter-
rible urgency he reeled up staggered
forward on rubbery legs he ran against
a tree and fell he wanted fervently to
lie still to give way to the aching sickness
which engulfed him but that inner lash
beat him upright

  he staggered into a run sobbing with
effort his glassy eyes seeing only vague
blurs he drove into and over things
but the very act of moving pumped new
strength into him it was like a night-
mare of some horrible unending chase

  afterward ki-gor was never to know
how long he had kept on nor by what
paths he had gone he had been a wounded
animal blindly seeking escape his feet
had thought for him there was a blank
in his memory from the time he spun
to get behind the baobab tree until the
next morning when he awakened to find
himself huddled under a thorn bush in
a narrow deep ravine

  he awoke to the dull throb of pain
in his head he lay face down and his
body was a mass of bruises and aches
he crawled from beneath the bush and
anxious to know where he was climbed
the precipitous difficult wall of the ravine
when he reached the top he was winded
and flung himself down to rest a heavy


jungle stories

mist that alternately cleared and deepened
seemed to lay over the area about him
he blinked his eyes trying to probe
through the fog and identify his surround-
ings

  he raised a hand to his aching fore-
head his fingers touched a great blood-
crusted welt it came back then the scene
in the clearing his break for freedom
and the sudden crushing blow which had
blotted out everything where was he
how had he gotten here

  he strained to penetrate the dancing
mist and abruptly he realized the truth

  there was no mist it was his eyes
the blurred greyness lay entirely within
his own vision

  ki-gor sat stone still and the steady
powerful beat of his heart faltered drop
by drop the poison of fear gathered in
his throat trickled with acid hotness into
his tight-cramped stomach for the first
time in his life the white lord knew
what it was to be afraid

  blindness to him meant helplessness
and in the jungle the helpless swiftly died
it was not the thought of his own fate
that made him afraid it was thought of
his beloved mate helene of his pygmy
friends and of the countless humble black
men who would know death and torture
if he did not survive

  without his sight he could not hope
to outwit for long the fanged killers of
the forest let alone deal with the un-
principled adventurer who called himself
momba-ngar by now helene was held
prisoner by the legless man and knowing
of ki-gors escape she would be waiting
for her husband to come to her aid
ngeeso too if he still lived would be
watching for him placing his trust in
the white lord who had never been
known to fail a friend

  the thought of all that depended on
him brought ki-gor to his feet perhaps
if he treated the wound on his head that
grey curtain before his eyes would dis-
sipate he started in search of herbs with
which to dress the wound but panic grew
in his heart as he stumbled over roots
walked into shrubs moved time after time
into blind alleys of foliage

  and as the panic grew he exerted him-
self all the more using sheer physical
strength to bull his way through the under-

brush he was like an animal mad with
pain he forgot the reason of his search
he tore and smashed at every obstacle
the sweat pouring from him and his heart
pounding and steadily the greyness about
him thickened shading deeper until sud-
denly he was in utter darkness

  the shock of that stygian blackness
brought him to his senses he stopped
his hands going over his eyes he stood
like that for long dreadful minutes then
without a sound he slowly sank down on
the forest floor burying his face in his
arms

  ki-gor was completely blind

v

runners had gone ahead to prepare
the tatoga for the gods coming
george duran for such was one of the
legless mans better known names waited
until dusk to make his entry into the
kraal then preceded by booming drums
he was borne out of the jungle on chief
nanookos litter

  sepah and the chief wizard had done
their work well durans last fears of
failure were swept away by the sight that
greeted him the silent frightened throng
of blacks took one look at him in the
half-light and flung themselves moaning
to the ground

  a wild brutal joy gripped duran this
was the power he had always dreamed of
the power of a god and to think that a
mere chance meeting with that greedy
ambitious black wench sepah had opened
the door to all this he had seen her in
the ochari kraal and by a judicious use
of gifts had arranged with her master
to have her sent for his entertainment

  by all the devils she had entertained
him all right but more than that she had
proposed this venture at the very time his
bargaining with the ochari had reached
an impasse he had thought it prepos-
terous at first but the unscrupulous little
baggage had proved her point by taking
him out to the pens where the male slaves
were kept the tatoga men when he
played the part sepah had coached him
in hailed him as the god momba-ngar
come to deliver them from the ochari
since the last of his funds had gone for
the gifts wasted on the ochari and he
slave of the jackal priestess

couldnt risk showing his face in any of
the port towns he had decided to take
the gamble proposed by the girl

  he could thank the girl for everything
if he were the thanking kind but
duran was under no delusions as to the
reason for sepahs loyalty she thought
she had him fooled but he knew they
were two of a kind he was the instrument
through which she could gain the wealth
and power for which she hungered and
to gain her ends she would passionately
embrace the devil himself

  his eyes sought out sepah where she
walked ahead of his litter hungrily fol-
lowed the sensual sway of hips the day
would come he knew when she would
become dangerous but until she found
out that he didnt mean to be a mere
stepping-stone for a black wench he could
count on her devotion

  durans mouth thinned cruelly she had
gotten him out of tom parsons hands
in the nick of time another couple of
days and that hypodermic needle would
have finished him he gave an angry
grunt whod ever think that spineless
yellowbelly would have the guts to try
to kill him well that was another little
matter he would take pleasure in settling

  yeah the girl had been right on every
count except one she had promised him
that they could sew ki-gor up quick hed
heard of that white apes reputation and
knew what trouble he could cause it beat
anything how the jungle man had gotten
clean away but the blacks said there was
no doubt but what he was badly hurt
and sepah already had put the best tatoga
trackers on his spoor

  it was that crockhead nanookos fault
anyway if the old fool had killed him
immediately as sepah and gita had ad-
vised everything would have been all
right it would be best to get the fumbling
old man out of the way at the earliest
opportunity

  the reception he was getting eased
some of the tension in his belly sepah
had barely gotten the wizards assistants
to the cavern in time to remove the stone
image and make him up for his role as
a god he had wanted to recover a little
more strength before making his advent
as momba-ngar but necessity had left
him no choice that one close call was

enough to prove how dangerous ki-gor
could be if it hadnt been for nanookos
nap the game would have been over
before it began

  durans attention was brought back to
the immediate scene when his litter bearers
mounted the steps of a platform built that
afternoon before the council house they
lowered him so that he sat on the edge
of the platform looking out over the pros-
trate blacks he wet his lips nervously
knowing he must address his new sub-
jects then sepah was bowing low beside
him whispering the words he must say
and his feeling of confidence returned

  he spoke out to the tatoga reminding
them of their warrior past telling them
he had returned to make them masters of
the congo he painted glowing pictures
of the food gold and ivory which would
be theirs of the countless slaves who
would take over every familys work

  with momba-ngar to lead you you
are invincible he shouted and for all
this which i shall give you i ask only one
small thing in return unquestioning obedi-
ence from chieftain to child all must
obey

  duran paused expecting the crowd to
break into approving cries he was greeted
with utter silence his face paled what
was wrong with them he threw a dis-
tressed look at sepah

  bid them rise master and speak their
hearts she said softly her lips curved
in a faintly mocking smile in the pres-
ence of a god they dare make no sound
without permission

  he did as she instructed immediately
a deafening tumult was unloosed the
blacks leaped and yelled deliriously salut-
ing duran if the god said they were to
be lords of the jungle then of course
they wholeheartedly approved when there
was no danger of failure no chance they
might have to pay for what they did
right or wrong no longer worried them

after ordering the feasting to begin
duran had himself carried into the
council house which he had chosen for
his quarters he quickly got rid of nanoo-
ko and the elders it took longer with
gita for he looked on himself as an equal
partner in the venture sepah had taken
the wizard into her confidence the night
	jungle

she left parsons and his help had actually
effected the scheme

  hai white man you see i handle
things well boasted gita speaking as an
equal from the time i slipped into the
trading post with one of my men and
carried you out of the hands of death
i have successfully guided us

  duran hid his anger at the mans fa-
miliar tone and nodded agreement the
wizard was a slippery fish and could still
bring about his downfall

  in all the days ahead you will be my
right arm duran said thinking the florid
native compliment would satisfy gita

  the wizard spat on the dirt floor and
putting his arms behind his back stared
at duran with his cheetahs face

  let us begin by understanding each
other white man he said coolly it is
you who will be my right arm i do not
abandon a master i can easily control to
take on one i do not know it is gita
who will be the master between the three
of us

  the legless man had lived his life
among dangerous double-dealing crimi-
nals though the pulse-beat in his bull-
like neck quickened he maintained a re-
markable outward calm his glance shifted
slowly to sepah but he saw by her sur-
prise that she was not a party to gitas
cool scheme

  and suppose i dont agree asked
duran quietly studying his broad square
fingers

  you will remember that only my assis-
tants and i know the mysteries of the
cavern reminded gita at any time i
can produce the stone image in its old
place and discover that you are after all
an imposter the fate of a man who makes
mock of momba-ngar isnt pleasant

  from outside came the rising din of the
celebration graphically reminding duran
how easily swayed the savage black men
were the natives were accustomed to
looking on gita as their go-between with
momba-ngar it would take time to loosen
his grip on them

  youre no warrior gita protested
sepah the lord duran understands war
and looting as the white men practice it
without his leadership our plans are
doomed

  gita stiffened under this prick to his

stories

boundless self-esteem he half-turned to-
ward the door

  either i lead he threatened or the
tatoga hear now how you two have
tricked them

  im glad to follow you duran lied
smoothly so long as i get my share of
the loot i dont care who gives the orders
the main thing is that we must stick
together

  gita studied duran doubtfully

  to prove i mean what i say the
legless man went on just tell me what
you would iike done first

  sepah looked from one to the other
of the men she was puzzled by durans
swift capitulation she knew something
of gitas habits and the thought of having
to shift her allegiance to him wasnt
pleasant but if he was to be master then
she must be certain of his favor that
ugly devil of a white man wouldnt be so
calm later on when he discovered he had
given her away along with his power

  why uh began gita slowly still feel-
ing out duran i want first to get nanoo-
ko out of the way hes a sly old jackal
and the people love him which makes him
too dangerous to have around

  youre absolutely right duran swiftly
agreed he knew how to handle this sav-
age now i know you dont want to be
blamed for his death so ill take the
responsibility tomorrow ill begin to com-
plain of feeling an enemy near me then
in a few days ill order you to smell out
this man working against me naturally
youll pick out nanooko ill dispose of
him myself with my throwing stick

  gita beamed the white man had knuck-
led under more easily than he had ex-
pected he had hated nanooko all the years
he had served him and he had an in-
grained fear of the old man with the
chieftain dead he would have no one to
oppose his influence

  anything else you want  asked duran
eagerly he could tell the wizard had an-
other matter in his mind which he was
hesitant about revealing

  yes gita admitted there is then
he launched into a long talk on the im-
portance of his gaining face with the
other tribes of doing something striking
which would impress upon them that he
was a man to be reckoned with his eyes
slave of the jackal priestess



kept sliding past durans finally he
could delay the issue no longer

  i want to take the white lords mate
as my wife he blurted we will have
a great ceremony and momba-ngar him-
self will perform the marriage rites
hai he cried excitedly every tongue
in the jungle will wag when its known
i have taken ki-gors woman

  duran pulled at his lower lip his yellow
eyes drawing to thoughtful slits accord-
ing to native beliefs the ultimate humilia-
tion a conqueror could visit on an humbled
chieftain was to take over his wives in
ki-gors case the matter would have even
greater meaning for the jungle mans
fierce devotion to his red-haired mate was
known throughout the congo

  sepah caught her breath she wanted
no rivals especially not that golden-skin-
ned blue-eyed woman with that body
of hers helene would have both gita and
duran around her little finger if she
wished sepah judged all women by her
own standards and she knew from ex-
perience what a compliant slave girl could
do to influence a master

  you forget the white lord still lives
she objected hastily remember what has
happened to others who desired the red-
haired woman

  but gitas quick rise in the world filled
him with bravado his lips twisted scorn-
fully

  so much the better that he lives he
snarled it will show my contempt for
him

  then he glanced narrowly at duran
suspicious that his silence meant opposi-
tion he half-expected that the white man
would oppose his taking a woman of his
race but duran surprised him

  youre a clever man rumbled duran
its a wonderful idea and well make
something big out of it he hesitated
but how do we get our hands on this
woman 

  gita blinked in surprise why shes
a prisoner now we caught her with ki-
gor

  ohhh duran murmured cutting his
eyes at sepah the cunning wench had
neglected to tell him about helene he
smiled inwardly hed show both these
sly blacks a trick or so before he was
through

  let me see he mused we must do
this right lets send messengers to every
neighboring tribe informing them momba-
ngar has returned to life and that five
days hence the god will wed his favorite
son gita to helene well invite all the
chieftains to attend after the ceremony
well grab the whole bunch and hold them
as hostages

angry concern was written in se-
pahs expression she saw herself
being completely thrown aside the legless
man had let himself be shorn of power
without a struggle and now gita was plan-
ning to take a woman of another race

  yes yes gita hissed delightedly
thats it-a big ceremony then he
frowned we mustnt hold the chieftains
though we would be shamed in the eyes
of others a guest cant be harmed unless
he wrongs his host

  duran made a deprecatory gesture
look wouldnt you like to have twenty
tribes calling you king well you can do
that if you move fast and forget about
rules what do you care about customs
so long as you win let the other fellows
play fair and well play to win

  he went on to explain that with the
chieftains in their hands the leaderless
tribes wouldnt dare attack them

  well pick the tribes off one by one
keeping them from organizing by tying
them up with long-winded conferences
promises that were about to release their
chieftains threats about what will happen
if they make a hostile move

  the small-minded wizard hadnt en-
visoned conquest on such magnitude he
would be a king of kings his qualms of
honor quickly succumbed to greed

  by the gods youre right he cried
grandly what have rules to do with one
such as gita

  his eyes were glittering black beads on
dreams alone the wizard was drunk al-
ready

  i go to arrange for messengers to pre-
pare the drummers to sound the news of
my marriage to the jungle his tongue
flicked over his lips yes and i will
amuse myself by visiting the girl

  duran threw up his hands in immedi-
ate disapproval

  remember we must act carefully until


jungle stories

nanooko is gone he cautioned show no
interest in the girl tomorrow before the
whole tribe i will inform her of the honor
which is to be hers

  gita hesitated and then nodded reluc-
tant agreement nanooko would be furi-
ous if the wizard of his own accord mo-
lested helene but if momba-ngar
suggested the marriage the old man would
have to give his approval gita left mut-
tering because for a few more days he
must bend to the chieftains desires

  a smile gathered on the legless mans
ugly features as he watched the wizard go
he scratched down his hairy chest and
across his paunchy stomach he looked
well pleased with himself as he turned his
glance on sepah

  you gonna stand around posing all
night he growled cmere you little filly
why do you think ive been trying to get
rid of all these apes

  the room was illuminated with torches
stuck in the dirt floor sepahs skin was
burnished copper in the yellow light her
only covering was a small leather apron
held by a thong twisted low about her
hips her jutting breasts rose and fell with
the hard fast sweep of her breathing

  but the emotion revealed in her face
was rage she was so angry that she was
momentarily speechless this white man
had cheated her of everything she had
worked for and now he thought she would
come to him wriggling with happiness

  you filthy dango she burst out
crawling on your belly before that weak-
ling gita so he is to be a great king and
you are to be his servant so he is to
marry that red-haired wench her teeth
beneath her curved lips were a cats white
fangs and sepah is forgotten

  she whirled with feline litheness and
sprang toward the nearest torch she
snatched the length of wood from the
ground and raised it like a club

  ill pay you back for this she cried
she leaped in at him meaning to crush
his bullet head with the flaming torch

  sepah didnt realize duran deliberately
had goaded her curious to know how she
would react despite his apparent absorp-
tion in gita he had been slyly watching
her guessing the thoughts in her mind all
the while he talked with the wizard

  duran was slightly surprised at the vio-

lence of outburst but he wasnt caught
unprepared as the nearly-naked girl flung
at him he waited his head hunched deep
in his beefy shoulders his huge arms
spread wide to the floor he didnt move
a muscle until she was almost on him

  then he spun himself like a great crab
pivoting his trunk by a swift scuttling
motion of his hands he moved with an
amazing agility whipping out of the
girls way then whirling back to grasp her
slim ankle in his thick fingers as many
others had discovered too late sepah
learned duran was not so helpless as he
looked

  she tried to turn and aim a second blow
at him but he jerked her legs from under
her the girl hit flat on her stomach the
torch rolling out of her fingers duran
watched her lie stunned struggling for
breath he gave an ugly chuckle and
pulled her through the dirt toward him

  he ran his hand up the glossy firmness
of her leg she tried to struggle but his
rough fingers closed about her waist and
he pulled her into his arms

  so youd kill old duran eh he
taunted sepah was rigid with fear not
knowing what the brutish white man would
do to her well my pretty cat you must
learn im not as stupid as you think here
all day ive been thinking of being alone
with you and in the very first minute you
try to bash in my head

  but your promises to me she whim
pered her eyes wide with fright you
didnt keep them you said i was to have
everything i wanted and then you let gita
bluff you he and that cursed helene will
have everything and ill be no more than
dirt beneath their feet

  again the hoarse unpleasant chuckle
rose in durans throat

  the only thing im going to give that
brush-rat gita is a broken neck he
growled youre dumb as he is cant you
see what im using him for

  anger lashed up in sepah making her
forget caution

  you lie she accused i heard you
promise to marry him to helene youll
be nothing and hell be a king

  duran crushed her closer flickering
lights beginning to burn in his yellow eyes

  you said yourself the one man who
could beat us was ki-gor he reminded
slave of the jackal priestess



her well im baiting a trap to catch
him before he has time to cause trouble
hell come out of that jungle roaring like
a lion when he hears that gita means to
take his woman

  the rigidity went out of sepah with
pleased surprise and then open admira-
tion she viewed the plan

  that will keep him from leaving the
area to go get the masai and the pygmies
she exclaimed breathlessly and well have
all the local chieftains here so that he cant
stir up any of the nearby tribes

  right he said hes fool enough to
try to save her even if he has to go it
alone-and well be ready for him

  a question returned to sepahs face
what about gita

  duran buried his thick lips in the soft-
ness of her shoulder then he raised his
head showing his stained teeth in a tri-
umphant smile

  i hope to let ki-gor kill gita for us
he said that way well be finished with
both of them at the same time gita is the
bait and you always let the fish swallow
the bait before you pull it in

  sepah giggled and nuzzled against him
her arms slipping about his neck she was
suddenly like a hot devouring flame duran
allowed himself a moment of amusement
at her falseness but his half-sneer melted
under her knowing attentions

  and this helene she murmured in
his ear youll slay her too

  just trust old duran to take care of
everything and everybody he said grin-
ning at the wall behind her she gave a
shrill little cry of contentment at his prom-
ise it was well she couldnt read what was
in his mind

vi

ki-gor lay with his eyes tightly closed
his head buried in his arms for more
than an hour the throbbing beat of pain
through his head seemed to say with end-
less repetition blind blind blind at
first he was unconscious of the world
about him his mind turned inward with
shock

  he was cut off from everything

  but gradually the sounds and smells of
the jungle crept in on him and each one
brought a picture of another small accus-

tomed thing which he would never see
again

  he smelled the subtly-sweet fragrance
of the grass on which he lay with the
damp warm odor of the brown earth
pressing in behind it he heard the dart-
ing irregular rustle of a lizard stalking
insects not a hands reach away never be-
fore had the bird calls been so clear so
liquidly perfect each carving a quick-
winged image on his tightly-closed lids
in endless procession the catalogue of or-
dinary but suddenly precious jungle life
continued in his minds eye

  vaguely he became aware that in the far
distance a signal drum had begun to talk
it was only another sound among many
touching him evoking a picture but stir-
ring no thought processes he held the
drum-throb for an instant and then thrust
it away to go on to the chattering exchange
of two grey-ruffed monkeys and the ill-
tempered explosive grunts of a wild hog
marching his family through the brush

  he drifted in a half-dream consciously
resisting real thought the drum finished
and was silent he noted the gap it left in
the pattern of noise and then forgot it
but the jungle telegraph because of tricks
played by forest and wind and distance
often is uncertain and black men must re-
peat important messages over and over
until there can be no mistake in meaning

  gradually the drumming bored into his
hurt stupor and from sheer habit he
caught occasional words and phrases not
willing it but piecing the drum-taps auto-
matically into meaning like an electric
shock one of these disconnected words
blasted him out of his lethargy he swept
aside all other noises reached with strain-
ing ears for the drum-talk

  his face twisted with hate as he lis-
tened he leaped to his feet the great
muscles of his body taut with his fury it
was helene the drum spoke of

  the tatoga drummer boasted to the
jungle that the living god momba-ngar
would give helene in marriage to the wiz-
ard gita five suns hence gita had beaten
the cowardly white lord had run him
trembling into the forest the drummer
said and the marriage was a sign to all
that ki-gors power was forever broken

  in his wrath ki-gor forget himself
his eyes were wide-open staring at the


jungle stories

lanes of trees the thick-banked teeming
greenery of the undergrowth he started
running toward the drum his one thought
being to find gita and kill him with his
bare hands and he wasnt blundering and
falling now he sped with his old sureness
down tiny game trails searching out pas-
sages through the jungle where another
man would have been helplessly blocked

  he didnt realize he was seeing again
seeing with normal clarity until suddenly
the light about him flickered and went
grey mist seemed to leap up out of the
jungle floor wavering clouds of it smoth-
ering out the sun then the grey deepened
and ki-gor reeled to a stop slamming
against a tree just as utter darkness swal-
lowed the world

  he gave a sick agonized cry against
this thing he could not fight even his
anger could not hold against the tortured
wretchedness that gripped him as he real-
ized anew that he was too helpless to even
reach his mate let alone save her then
as his mind steadied he saw that for a
time his eyes had been all right the
blindness had been gone when he leaped
up under the lash of the drum message
why could he see one minute and the next
be totally blind

  he forced himself to be calm while step
by step he went back to the time he had
awakened that morning the first hint of
trouble was when he climbed out of the
ravine he grew panicky and tried to push
his way through the jungle then was
when he went totally blind after that he
rested quietly until he heard the drum
and leaping up he found he could see as
well as ever yet after running a few hun-
dred yards he was once more plunged
into blackness

  the answer sprang out at him so long
as his mind and body were at rest his
eyes functioned all right but physical ex-
ertion combined with mental turmoil some-
how blacked out his vision

  and before another hour passed ki-
gor proved this surmise true after he
rested his eyes cleared he found that by
going at a cautious walk only the faintest
mist danced before him a trot thickened
the mist and the exertion of running
swiftly brought full blindness

  beside a stream he found the herbs he
wanted and made a poultice for his head

then he set out for the tatoga kraal the
journey which tree-travel would have al-
lowed him to make in a half day took him
until noon of the next day tatoga war-
riors prowled ever path near the kraal
keeping a look-out for ki-gor it required
all his rich jungle lore to worm his way
past these blacks but at last the job was
done and he climbed into the cover of a
tree near the village

  he could hear a babble of excited na-
tive voices the plunging beat of hooves
and the legless mans roaring laugh he
climbed higher in the branches until he
could see into the central clearing the
sight that greeted him broke the iron con-
trol which he had maintained for hours
sent the angry blood plunging through his
veins with such violence that the blindness
struck him again

nder the cool shade of a thatch
pavilion sat the legless man drinking
native beer with tom parson by their
look and by the number of gourds scat-
tered around them they had been busy for
a long time with the bitter potent brew
sepah tended their wants purring about
the legless man like a well-fed cat

  but duran wasted no attention on se-
pah his eyes were riveted delightedly on
the clearing where he was staging some
brutal show for his twisted pleasure on
one side ngeeso and his pygmies were
held at spear point by nanookos giant
guards whom duran had taken over for
his own while across the clearing more
guards held seven zebra duran was forc-
ing the pygmies to ride bare-backed and
without even a halter to aid them he was
screeching with glee as the wild ponies
threw the small men and tried to tram-
ple them

  the tatoga fancied the taste of zebra
meat and often journeyed to the veldt to
trap them alive in a tour of the kraal
that morning duran spotted the ponies in
their pen it occurred to him that if he
could break one of the stubborn little ani-
mals he would be able to get about for
himself instead of having to be carried on
the litter from that idea to making the
pygmies risk their lives on the ponies had
been an easy natural step for duran

  all of the pygmies except ngeeso had
been forced to ride when ki-gor climbed
slave of the jackal priestess



into his vantage point duran had saved
the pygmy chieftain for the last and had
taken a sadistic pleasure in taunting the
little man every time one of his warriors
was thrown though ngeeso was seething
inside he never deigned to show the least
emotion at durans insults

   lets see the little rooster keep his dig-
nity on that largest pony cried the leg-
less man

   six guards hanging on desperately led
the wildest of the zebras to the center of
the clearing the tatoga warriors pressed
closer anxious to see the rock-hard pygmy
leaders nerve broken

   get up there you little dango roared
duran

   ngeeso stared unflinchingly at his tor-
mentor he folded his arms across his
chest and spat disdainfully in the dust

   offal of a jackal he said coldly the
sun will never rise on the day when n-
geeso dances to your music

   a dead silence slammed over the watch-
ing blacks it was unthinkable that a mere
man should so address momba-ngar
they were stunned waiting for their
dread god to splinter ngeeso with light-
ning duran blinked dully caught off-
guard by this unexpected show of resis-
tance from a man completely at his mercy

   he noted how the crowd froze realized
that they watched to see how he acquitted
himself he could have the pygmy slain
but then he felt the little man would die
the victor for he openly invited death
rather than submit to durans order to
save his face he must bring ngeeso to
his knees

  have you lost your voice sneered
ngeeso go on and order these cowardly
women you call warriors to use their
spears this is the only kind of killing
they are capable of doing a hundred spears
against an unarmed man he snorted with
contempt aaaiieee they will need to
learn how a man should die because for
this days work ki-gors blade will take a
terrible toll of this soft-bellied pack

   durans face purpled the veins of his
tremendous neck swelling with rage his
eye fell on gita and seeing the wizard he
had a sudden inspiration hed show the
tatoga how duran could bring this bark-
ing terrier to heel

-jungle stories-spring

  bring out the red-haired woman he
ordered concealing his true feelings with
a silken tone we will let her ride until
ngeeso changes his mind about amusing
us

  he saw the quick look of fear which
came over ngeeso and he bellowed with
delight ha hed caught the pygmy in his
soft place the little chieftain would eat
dirt now because he could never bear to
see helene mistreated though at first
duran had meant only to bluff ngeeso
into riding he was so pleased at seeing
his victim squirm that he decided to actu-
ally make the girl ride

   gita who had been enjoying the sadis-
tic proceedings immensely abruptly
changed his tack when he saw his soon-to-
be property endangered he rushed to
durans side a mixture of anger and con-
cern on his features

  this cannot be he hissed into du-
rans ear the girl will be killed or at
very best badly injured

  but duran had had enough to drink so
that he didnt care what the wizard said
or did he waved gita away stop wor-
rying me you faker he snarled im
running this show fool with me and ill
put you on a zebra

gita stumbled back aghast he was a
coward by nature with durans
slapping him out of the way so unhesitat-
ingly and with the crowd excitedly ac-
claiming the spectacle decreed by their
master he didnt have the nerve to protest
further in contrast to the wizard sepah
was beside herself with glee nothing
would please her more than to see the
white womans hateful beauty shredded
under the zebras hooves

  and strangely enough the one person
in that whole turbulent crowd who was
wholly calm wholly self-possessed was
the slim long-limbed girl who was the
cause of the whole storm she strode into
the clearing with her head held high her
cool blue eyes looking neither to right nor
left judging by her manner the guards
clustered about her were an escort of
honor

  duran was disappointed if he thought
to see fear on her face though she was
paler than normal she stared off toward
the jungle while the legless man told her


jungle stories

she must ride the maddened zebra

  you have your great and good friend
ngeeso to thank for this he added
venomously

  ngeesos control broke no physical
torture could have shaken him he would
have died under the whip before asking for
mercy but he could not bear to see the
white lords mate mistreated on his ac-
count

   wait he cried leave helene alone
and ill do whatever you say

  duran pounded one great fist delight-
edly into his palm his harsh laugh echo-
ing over the kraal

  so you change your tune do you he
gibed well well see about your riding
later-after were through with the
wench

  ngeeso trembling with the desire to
smash duran with his bare fists fought to
regain his voice helene saw that the
pygmy meant to degrade himself further in
an attempt to save her

   enough old friend she called to him
am i not the wife of ki-gor no matter
what happens i forbid you to beg before
that aasvoel on my account after all is
not the zebra preferable to that greasy
gita

   heartbroken because he was so helpless
the pygmy blinked back tears and nodded
acquiescence helene spoke the cold truth
when she said that it was better for ki-
gors woman to die this way than to fall
into gitas hands

  helene shrugged away the guards ea-
gerly thrusting her toward the zebra her
gesture spoke both her personal courage
and her contempt for the thronging spec-
tators she strode to the knot of blacks
straining to hold the maddened pony
without the least hesitation she leaped
astride the animal dug her heels into its
bell

  crouched on a limb the white lord
fought to still the hot blood thundering in
his head building a darkcurtain before
his eyes his sharp ears had caught every
word spoken by the legless man and he
knew now by the tense muttering of the
crowd that his beloved mate must be walk-
ing toward the zebra

  with five hundred men at his back it
would have been debatable whether he
could smash into the kraal and reach

helene in time to save her alone and

unarmed as he was what chance was there
for him to cause even a momentary dis-
traction but all this he kept from his
mind as he prayed that he might see for
to one such as ki-gor it was unthinkable
that he should not interfere

  and gradually indistinctly the kraal
swam back into view he could make out
the dark clots of watching natives the
yellow burn of sunlight on the hard earth
though none of her features was distin-
guishable he knew the white figure mov-
ing across the clearing was helene he
watched her reach the swaying group
which could only be warriors hanging to
the zebra

  there was a terrible long-enduring mo-
ment in which nothing moved no sound
was uttered then it happened to ki-
gors dim eyes it was like the swift open-
ing of some monstrous flower black petals
sprayed outward as the natives leaped to
safety and revealed like an exquisite
richly colored center was the poised figure
of rider and mount

  ki-gors heart caught in mid-beat and
he gave an agonized groan he had hesi-
tated too long waiting for his vision to
clear and even as he groaned the sav-
age blood-cry of the natives exploded the
silence the zebra reared high on two legs
and insane from the noise and the feel of
the womans thighs locked about it gave a
great reaching leap

  the white lord no longer knew nor
cared what he did he came upright on
the limb a heavy branch was in his
hand with a wrenching tug he tore it
free of the tree in the absence of any
other weapon he sought a bludgeon as in-
stinctively as would have a stone age
man

  he was abruptly kill-crazy berserk
with the desire to batter into pulp those
men who tortured his mate

  in a crackling break of twigs he scram-
bled down through the tree untilhe reached
a long limb extending over the kraal wall
he ran out over the limb careless of the
white haze through which he moved the
sense of balance and the surefootedness
acquired through years of tree-travel man-
aged to supplement his blurred eyes
enough to get him beyond the wall then
as the branch sagged under his weight he
slave of the jackal priestess



leaned and caught it with his left hand
and swung into the kraal

  ki-gor hit the ground running darted
down an aisle of huts toward the clearing
he heard the cry of the mob suddenly
alter there were shrieks of warning and
then of fear

  then he reached the edge of the clearing
and learned the reason

  the zebra instead of spinning and
bucking as had the others in the center of
open space until he had rid himself of his
burden reared high with helene and then
drove at a wild gallop straight for the
guards holding the pygmies bent low on
the ponys back her fingers twisted into
its mane helene held on with all her
strength

  the guards at first thought the animal
would turn helene alone realized the
crazed beast was beyond controlling yell-
ing and waving their hands the guards
held their ground conscious of the ridi-
cule which would be heaped on them if
they ran before it was certain the zebra
wouldnt swerve

too late they tried to get clear in a
tangle of writhing bodies they fought
to run ki-gor arrived on the scene just
as the front rank of warriors broke in
panic the spark of their fear leaped to
the crowd on either side and in two whole
walls of screiming falling bodies the
crowd splintered apart

  into this mass catapulted the zebra the
shock of its running weight flung men
aside sheared them like saplings crushed
by a battering ram then the feel of bodies
against and beneath it made the zebra
turn and fight to get away in a plunging
ball of madness the animal leaped and
kicked whirling first in one direction and
then another

  in one of its first arcing bucks helene
was thrown she was pitched over the
zebras head and fell into a group of war-
riors their clawing hands tore at her
hysterically and she slid through their
mass to the ground heedlessly they tram-
pled over helene in their rush to get
away from the zebra

  the pygmies were swept back with the


jungle stories

crowd jammed into a tight knot by the
pressure of the larger warriors about
them their guards were concerned with
themselves not their charges ngeeso
kept his head about him crying to his
men to stand together so by their com-
bined efforts they could keep from being
trampled

  ki-gor heard ngeesos shrill clear
voice and headed toward it it was a point
to steer by in the fog through which he
moved because of the confusion he
reached the very flanks of the crowd be-
fore being discovered a shocked black
tearing free of his fellows turned to con-
front him the black clawed for his knife

  ki-gor pulverized the mans head with
a single blow a berserk lion would have
struck with no more ferocity with all his
terrible strength the white lord laid
about him with the club he had come to
kill and now be killed the utter darkness
could come on him at any time and know-
ing this he was one possessed trying to
wreak the greatest possible havoc in the
brief time that remained to him

  never before had men seen the white
lord utterly without mery without feel-
ing his wrath was a white-hot flame
sweeping out to engulf everything in its
path men died hardly knowing what new
terror had come upon them he beat them
down splintering their bodies to red pulp
and leaped on to new victims whose first
warning of his presence was the spatter-
ing wash of their fellows blood

  the attention of the shouting cursing
crowd was still fastened on the zebra so
the white lord battered his way to the
pygmies before his presence could become
generally known the cries of those who
fell before him merged with the shrieks of
those hurt by the zebra or trampled by
their fellows

  but ngeeso trying to lead his men out
of the disorder saw the white lords
red-smeared bulk wildly laying about with
the huge club as he ripped a path through
the tatoga for the barest fraction of
time the little chieftain was stunned un-
believing it was impossible that ki-gor
could materialize here in the very center
of the enemys kraal

  but it was the white lord and seeing
the awesome madness that lay on his great
friend ngeeso was shaken with the real-
ization that alone and without hope of suc-
cess ki-gor had come to fight for his wife
and friends this was a courage a loyalty
beyond any code of honor a deed to stir
any primitive fighting man

 a tatoga guard stumbled against
ngeeso cobra-quick the pygmy leaders
hand snaked to the warriors sword-like
knife the blade came free in one swift
tug the warrior reached for him but
ngeeso twisted in his grasp jammed the
knife upward nearly its full length under
the rib bones and cut the core out of the
man

  he swayed back pulling the steel clear
and straightening his arm ran through a
second warrior before the man was
down ngeeso had opened the throat of
a third and with each sword stroke the
slave of the jackal priestess



battle fervor whipped higher in him

  ki-gor he shrilled and the name was
a battle cry ki-gor is here

  then did the hard-faced little men about
him see the jungles most fabled warrior
literally tearing a path through the tatoga
to reach them they saw too the bloody
example being set them by their chieftain
in the hot lands of the dark-skinned peo-
ples where passions go uncloaked by civil-
ization the proper spark can change a
man in a twinkling from meekness to
suicidal mania

  shall it be known that we cowered
like dogs screamed ngeeso while the
white lord fought and died for us 
aaaiieee burst out a pygmy to
him while there is time

  kill kill roared another and sud-
denly all care of life was gone from them

  with explosive fury the pygmies ran
amok they grabbed up the arms of the
men ngeeso had slain they dragged
down the bewildered blacks about them
with the automatic precision of men long
trained to battle they shaped themselves
into a wedge with ngeeso at the point
and plowed toward the white lord in a
resistless surge

  they were about him then with wild
cries of triumph shielding him with their
steel they saw his face with the crusted
wound the staring eyes the mouth sheered
wide for his hot breath to pass and the
sight flogged them to great efforts they
did not guess his blindness but knew only
he had endured much at the hands of the
tatoga

the crowd broke apart splintering be-
fore this new terror the men nearest
the pygmies flung back and their fear was
communicated to those unable to see what
was occurring the zebra had at last been

felled and there was nothing to restrain
the mobs flight because they were in
their own kraal few of the warriors ex-
cept nanookos guard were fully armed
this fact gave the pygmies a fleeting ad-
vantage for most of the guards in their
area had been concentrated around them
and in their first rush the little men had
cut them down

  as the crowd raced away leaving the
ground about them clear except for the
bodies of the dead and wounded ki-gor
turned fumblingly to find ngeeso

  helene he gasped where is she
ngeeso did not think the question
strange nor in the excitement did he no-
tice ki-gors actions he started to answer
that he did not know what had become of
her but before he could speak a keen-
eyed pygmy spotted her white body
sprawled among several tatoga

  the golden one lies there the man
exclaimed in fury the jackals have slain
her

  ki-gor reached toward the sound of
the mans voice caught him with fingers
of steel where he demanded quick
take me to her

  only there ki-gor the pygmy said
shaken by the jungle mans strange man-
ner but his pointing finger did not bring
a relaxation of that torturing grip

  take me to her thundered ki-gor
by the gods must i blunder around
blindly trying to find her have i no
friends to help me

  ngeeso and the man held by ki-gor
exchanged a queer look what was wrong
with the white lord but there was no


jungle stories

time to waste no time for thought the
pygmy led the jungle man at a run to
helene and ki-gor bent awkwardly
reaching for her

  a single choked inarticulate sound es-
caped ki-gors lips and then he lifted her
in his arms ngeeso he called put
one hand upon me and head for the gate
she must have the dignity of burial
though the rest of us die one at least
must get through with her

  ngeesos mouth dropped at his friends
request he could no longer mistake what
was wrong he looked at ki-gors staring
blood-streaked eyes moved his hands
swiftly before them they did not flicker
the great white warrior was blind

  stunned though he was by the discov-
ery within seconds of a double tragedy
the pygmy chifetain kept his presence of
mind his men were keyed to their high-
est fighting pitch inspired by ki-gors
presence to dare anything but if they
knew ki-gor was blind that flaming cour-
age might desert them

  without a word ngeeso spun and
started at a run out of the clearing lead-
ing ki-gor by the touch of his hand the
twin advantages of confusion and surprise
which had first favored the pygmies was
now gone the tatoga knew that there
were no men at ki-gors back and scram-
bling from every hut came warriors with
their arms

  the excitement also had swept the al-
coholic haze from durans mind he real-
ized that only the isolated group of pyg-
mies were back of the trouble and he sent
the guards about him into action with dire
threats as to what would happen to them
if every last pygmy werent immediately
cut to pieces

  the pygmies went streaking between the
huts their actions were completely with-
out thought of self already in their hec-
tic adventure they had lived far longer
than they had first expected they were
so possessed with the ecstacy of conflict
of extreme danger that death no longer
held any fears for them

  though the bulk of the tatoga pounded
behind them small groups of warriors
leaped out in their path trying to turn or
hold them the little men paused long
enough to send them reeling out of the
way then heedless of wounds or fatigue

they sprinted ahead to catch up with
ngeeso so that shifting relays of men
were always on guard about ki-gor

  due to the many tatoga women and
children running helter skelter in their
path as they twisted between the huts the
legless mans guards were unable to use
either spears or arrows for fear of slay-
ing their own people cold steel alone
could bring down the fugitives and at no
point could the tatoga gather strength
enough to withstand the murderous pygmy
charge

  at full tilt the pygmies reached the
four guards gathered at the gate ki-gors
protectors had not run that deadly gaunt-
let unscathed six of the brave little men
lay lifeless in the dust along the way and
every one of those still on their feet bled
from a dozen wounds yet they were rav-
ening lions as they came against the gate
guards they literally hacked the four
tatoga to bits flung them aside and
throwing up the crossbar burst open the
gates and darted into the forest

  scatter commanded ngeeso know-
ing that the more spoors the tatoga had
to follow the more chance there was that
a few of his men might come through alive
if the pygmies kept in a body eventually
the legless man would run them to earth

  at dusk tomorrow gather at the trad-
ing post he told them naming the first
place occurring to him that all the men
would know

  as the pygmies fanned out away from
him into the underbrush ngeesos face
was bitter strained how many of his
brave ones would live to see the trading
post but the tatoga were pouring out of
the kraal now and his thoughts were
jerked back to the immediate problem of
getting ki-gor into hiding

  ki-gor was the prey the tatoga wanted
worst of all and the hottest pursuit would
be on his trail

vii

near the tatoga kraal where the
paths were broad and hard-packed
with much travel ngeeso and ki-gor
managed to draw ahead of their pursuers
as soon as possible however ngeeso led
them away from the beaten ways into the
maze of tiny game trails where lay their
slave of the jackal priestess



only chance of actually losing durans
warriors

  he twisted back-tracked exercised all
the guile of a hunted antelope but it was
to no avail the tatoga clung to their
spoor and began to gain the blind grief-
numbed ki-gor left a trail even a white
man could have followed despite
ngeesos guiding hand the white lord
was like a sleep-walker reeling and stum-
bling with helene clasped tightly in his
arms

  it was a heart-breaking decision for the
pygmy to make but he realized unless he
could get ki-gor to put helene down
escape would be impossible at the edge
of a stream he stopped he turned almost
fiercely resolved to say what he must yet
his courage failed him when he saw ki-
gors sightless eyes wet with the only
tears any man had ever known him to shed

  let me try to carry her awhile
ngeeso said swallowing his intended
words

  ki-gor gave no sign he heard dumb
with grief he stood swaying before the
pygmy twice more ngeeso repeated his
offer before the jungle man reluctantly
gave up his burden

  as the pygmy took helene his eyes re-
mained fastened on ki-gor for all the
time they had been on the trail he pur-
posely had kept from looking at the dirt
and blood-caked figure the golden one
was what he and his people had called her
he did not want to look on her in death
to carry ever after the memory of what
the tatoga had done to her

  but as she came into his arms he stif-
fened a strange look crossing his face
helenes body was limp and pliable her
skin was cool but it lacked the cold clay-
like touch of the dead he knelt quickly
and stretched helene on the ground had
there still been life in her when they
picked her up in the clearing and had she
died in ki-gors arms while they fled or
was there still some tiny flicker of life
in her

  ngeesos trembling fingers detected a
faint extremely irregular pulse in helenes
throat her breathing was so slight and in-
frequent as to be practically unnoticeable
frantically he worked over her

  it was a full minute before the blind
white lord became aware of ngeesos

activity what is it you do he de-
manded suspiciously

  the pygmy had not wanted to raise false
hopes in his friend ki-gor had been too
dazed to recognize the small symptoms of
life he would never forgive himself if he
thought helene had died because of any
carelessness on his part but it was not in
ngeeso to lie to ki-gor

  the golden ones spirit fights to stay
in her body he said she is not dead as
we thought but i fear she is so near to
death there is nothing we can do

  a spasm caught ki-gors drawn fea-
tures his great fists clenched until it
seemed the very flesh must break beneath
the pressure in every line of his body was
expressed the unbearable sense of help-
lessnss which tortured him then he
caught hold of himself came forward until
he touched ngeeso

  he dropped to his knees awkwardly
found her pulse by feel he guided his
own mouth against hers tried to force the
breath of his body into her lungs but for
all his effort the pulse beneath his fingers
ebbed

  think of something he pleaded she
cant die we mustnt let her die

  and ngeeso hearing that appeal slow-
ly haltingly put his fingers to the upper
edge of his breechclout they rested on a
tiny bulge in the smooth face of the
leather

  there is only one thing i know of he-
declared but whether or not to try it is
a decision you alone must make he did
not mention that he broke a vow of secrecy

  he hurriedly explained that like each of
his warriors he carried a pellet of the
same poison used on the pygmy blowgun
darts the pellet was carried in a slit
made in the edge of his leather breech-
clout it was reserved for extreme emer-
gencies such as in war when a captured
pygmy was being tortured to make him
betray his people

  suicide was -honorable if it was to the
benefit of the tribe

  yes yes impatiently interrupted ki-
gor but what has poison to do with
saving helene 

  just this said ngeeso a full pel-
let of course will kill a man before he
can draw a breath but i have seen a tiny
portion stir the heart of a dying man send


jungle stories

his blood charging through his veins
again

  he glanced at helene drew a quick
breath

  a hand of times ive seen a dying man
live again many more times than that
however he confessed ive seen them
killed instantly by the poison or even
worse roused to a few days of torment

  the pygmys hand touched ki-gors
forearm

  i hold out no hope for on every per-
son the poison acts differently he ex-
plained i only say what i have seen
better she should die now than live on in
an agonized half-life for a day or so the
poison is cruel to those whose blood can-
not withstand it

like tiny drops of ice-water the sweat
came out on ki-gors white face he
knew the power of the poison and that
very power which could explode the heart
into action again also could tear away the
vitals of a person after reviving them

  his lips trembled use it he said
abruptly

  once the word was given ngeeso
moved swiftly he leaped up found a
small gourd on a vine and slashed it in
two with his sword with a twist of the
blade he cleaned the lower half of the
gourd he split open the small bulge in
his breechclout where the poison was
hidden

  from the pellet he shaved a minute
quantity of powder into the gourd he
estimated the amount his hands hovering
indecisively an instant and then he added
a bit more of the drug he added to the
powder no more than a single swallow of
water from the stream and stirred the
mixture with a twig

  he knelt slid an arm beneath helenes

shoulders and raised her to a sitting posi-
tion her head was tipped back limply
her mouth half-open ngeesos lips moved
soundlessly in a prayer to a pagan god of
whom helene would never have approved
he trickled the liquid into her throat very
slowly and after a minute laid her back
on the ground he watched her solemnly

  tell me ki-gor whispered

  it will take awhile soothed the chief-
tain she must rest quietly

  ki-gor frowned he cocked his head
and listened his preter-naturally sensitive
ears hearing faint sounds which escaped
ngeeso

  they come he warned cryptically
mentioning the unspoken fear which had
been between them for so long the per-
sistent tatoga trackers were bringing du-
rans warriors ever closer

  ki-gor shook off the dullness which had
held him he could not let helene down
while there was the faintest hope for her
survival no matter what his own condi-
tion was he must gather his shaken mind
and frayed nerves for yet another effort

  by its sound the stream runs both
swift and deep he commented

  it does that muttered ngeeso disin-
terestedly his thoughts directed toward
the important matter of keeping helene
and ki-gor from being trapped

  is there driftwood on the banks left
from the last flood ki-gor persisted

  ngeeso grunted in the affirmative
wondering to himself how ki-gor could
occupy himself with foolish questions at
such a time then ki-gors meaning struck
him he bounced to his feet

  a raft of course he cried we can
float her downstream and it will give you
a chance to get your strength back he
didnt mentioned ki-gors eyes

  the little man rolled three long logs to-
gether lashed them with vines he cut a
green pole to use in keeping the raft from
the banks he pushed the raft into shal-
low water laid helene on it tying her se-
curely enough to keep her from sliding
into the water but not so tightly that she
couldnt be pulled free if the logs over-
turned

  when ki-gor was settled in place
ngeeso pushed the raft into the current
he was panting with tension rather than
exertion though ki-gor hadnt again
slave of the jackal priestess



mentioned the approaching tatoga they
were so near that the pygmy himself could
plainly hear them

  slowly the current caught the raft edg-
ing it lazily out of the shallows ngeeso
strained at the pole then they were in the
center of the stream and the power of the
water gripped them hurled them forward
with sudden momentum

  a cry sounded on the bank behind them
a spear slapped hard on the logs beside
ngeeso tearing a white gash in the wood
running men pounded out of the jungle
tore through the underbrush along the
stream bedlam broke loose as the tatoga
sighted their quarry

  had ngeeso relented in his efforts for
a few moments their flight would have
been ended with bloody swiftness but
ngeeso was the son of chieftains born
and bred to war and not a muscle flinched
in that critical interval he laid his back
into the pole steadying the logs sending
them straight on their course

  the raft cut straight down the stream
with gathering speed outdistancing the
runners and making their casts fall short
not once did ngeeso turn a backward
look to them his only recognition of their
presence was a thin bitter smile toward
the river ahead when he was certain they
had won free

  an hour later he brought the raft skill-
fully beneath the cover of a limb which
fell low over the water he leaped into
the shallows anchored the raft in the mud
after helene was carried ashore he and
ki-gor broke the raft apart sent each log
downstream separately ngeeso erased
their sign from the bank and they bur-
rowed into the underbrush flung them-
selves down to rest

  for the first time since administering
the drug the two men now had an oppor-
tunity to give their whole attention to
helene

  her face had a bluish pallor which
frightened ngeeso but ki-gor in his
blindness couldnt see this and he sat with
his finger on her pulse

  suddenly helene made a queer rattling
sound in her throat the pygmy was un-
able to choke back a gasp he thought that
the noise was a death rattle but ki-gor
sat frozen seemingly oblivious to any
change in his mate

ngeeso groped for words to con-
sole ki-gor to express his own feel-
ings hear me ki-gor my heart breaks
that it should end this way i hoped and
prayed we could save her her blood is on
my hands for if it had not been for my
stubborn pride before the legless man she
might never have been made to ride

  he got grimly to his feet his right
hand gripped vise-like on his blade

   i have done this thing ki-gor but i
pledge you she shall not go into the shad-
ows alone he swore so soon as i have
given you over to my men i shall return
to the tatoga kraal to kill and die i will
wash out this crime with blood and i
swear my spirit will walk ever beside
helene serving her in the unknown dark-
ness

  the white lord tardily turned his
thoughts to what ngeeso was saying and
not until the pygmy was nearly finished did
the jungle man actually gather his mean-
ing then his face softened

   hush little lion he said hoarsely
helene lives not dies it is her first full
breath you hear not her last the poison
has stirred her heart

  ngeeso grasped helenes wrist with
a glad cry he saw that it was true her
erratic pulse grew stronger with every
heart beat quickly though he sobered

  we can travel now he said we
must get her to the post before she re-
gains consciousness he hesitated and
ki-gor finished for him

   i know the white lord admitted if
she wakes to pain we can care for her
better there it was a way of saying that
he realized the drug which had stirred her
to life could still kill her


jungle stories

  they reached the trading post two hours
after dusk they entered and placed hel-
ene on parsons bed she awoke for brief
intervals during the night but each time
lost consciousness without recognizing
either ki-gor or ngeeso her condition
was little changed throughout the next
iday and ki-gors increasingly haggard
look showed the rapid dwindling of his
hope for her recovery

  there were no bad wounds on her body
from weapons but she had been brutally
trampled by the stampeding tatoga ki-
gor and ngeeso knew how to treat
wounds they could see but they were baf-
fled by internal hurts and from her rest-
lessness the fear grew in them that the
poison ate at her vitals

  when the dragging march of the sun
ended that day the remainder of ngee-
sos warrior band began to slip into the
post they were a ragged broken remnant
only five had come through alive and they
stumbled with exhaustion and wounds
each ones arrival heightened the whole
groups danger of capture for it meant
another possible spoor for the tatoga to
follow

  ki-gor and ngeeso began to share
watches around the clock the white lord
was unable to rest either mentally or phys-
ically and because of this his vision never
cleared he moved either in total darkness
or in a blurred mist where he could only
vaguely make out objects his abnormally
keen senses of smell and hearing helped to
make his vigils more than an empty pose
especially at night when sight was of little
value and he maneuvered it so that most
of the night duty fell to him

  ki-gor grew adept at fooling even
ngeeso as to his true condition and he
constantly assured the pygmy leader that
his sight was returning when actually he
was merely learning to make his way about
the post without stumbling into obstacles
when the tatoga drums began to send the
face-saving tale that momba-ngar had
postponed the marriage of gita and hel-
ene to a more propitious time fourteen
days hence ki-gor couldnt derive even
the bitterest satisfaction from the message

  the legless mans embarrassment be-
cause neighboring chieftains were due to
begin arriving for the ceremony meant
that the search for helene would be inten-

sified never had ki-gor hated anyone as
he did duran his desire to kill the man
was like a wild bodily hunger a hunger
that gnawed more savagely as helene grew
weaker and more feverish

  on the third night soon after ki-gor
had climbed to the small watchtower on
the stockade about the post he caught the
scent of tatoga warriors there was no
mistaking their identity for along with
their body smell the breeze carried the
pungent odor of the particular oil with
which they smeared their bodies ki-gor
couldnt guess their number accurately but
he knew there were not more than five
or six

  he slid out of the watchtower dropped
to the ground and hurried into the house
to rouse ngeeso they may go past but
it is well to be ready he said calmly

  ngeeso sucked at his underlip thought-
fully these few wont have to stomach
to attack even if they find were in here
but theyll go yapping back for the rest
of the pack

  let us see that they dont get back
the white lord declared

  but how asked the pygmy at the
first spear we loose theyll flee like fright-
ened dik-dik deer

  they wont have a chance ki-gor
grimly pointed out well leave the gate
ajar as though the place were deserted
they wont pass up the chance to spend
the night indoors and once theyre all in-
side well close the gate three of your
pygmies are still able to make a few
passes with a knife despite their wounds
it wont take any real fighting since the
advantage of surprise will be on our side
ngeesos black eyes glittered approv-
ingly at the plan he roused the three men
ki-gor had indicated started them hob-
bling toward the gate ki-gor took one of
parsons covered cooking pots and squint-
ing his eyes to see opened the small iron
stove and scooped out coals from the
banked fire he took the traders thatch
broom soaked it with kerosene which the
trader used in his prized lantern

  then the jungle man went swiftly to
the gate gave the broom and covered pot
of coals to one of the pygmies along with
whispered instructions the men fell back
into the darkness along the wall as he
opened the gate satisfied that all was as
slave of the jackal priestess



he wished ki-gor climbed cautiously into
the watchtower

  the tatoga were much nearer now he
could follow their progress by the sudden
break in a night birds song by the faint
snap of a twig or the abrupt silence of
frightened tree toads these differences
in the hum of jungle life would have gone
unnoticed by the average man but ki-
gor knew their meaning

and then for the first time beneath
the harsh scent of the tatoga he dis-
tinguished a smell which made his face go
hard and cold a white man traveled with
the natives it could be either the legless
man or parson it didnt matter which it
was because both in their own way had
betrayed him and he remembered how the
two of them had sat together drinking beer
while the pygmies and helene were tor-
tured

  parsons participation he didnt under-
stand but it was clear that he had worked
hand in glove with the legless man to dis-
credit ki-gor the drunken act before
chief nanooko had been nothing more
than an act

  otherwise why would parson be sitting
as a friend with duran while the other
prisoners were misused

  ki-gor whispered the new information
to the pygmies and then crouched down
in the tower as he expected the tatoga
halted where the brush was cleared back
from the trading post and sent one man
crawling forward to reconnoiter the black
was careful coming with a snakes silence
circling away from the watchtower and
working his way flat along the wall to
the gate

  though for a time the native hesitated
staring into the blackness of the post the
open gate quieted any suspicions he held
he came ten steps inside the stockade and
stopped to listen the pygmies were within
easy reach of him but to all appearances
they had melted into the ground the black
gave a satisfied grunt and turning back
outside called in normal tones to his com-
panions that the place was deserted

  they came forward in a relieved group
grumbling together of their weariness and
hunger one man kept stumbling as though
he could hardly force his feet to move
those last few yards ki-gor stayed down

  so they wouldnt see his white skin but
he kept tabs on them with his ears

  when they were all within the stockade
and gathered almost below him he raised
silently gripped the balustrade around
the watchtower with one hand while with
the other he held a knife taken from
parsons trade stock it was time for the
pygmies to go into action

  with a sudden crash the gate slammed
closed in the same instant the kerosene
soaked broom burst into flame with light-
ning precision the pygmies sprang the
trap they bounded out of the darkness
with drawn blades

  but swift as the pygmies were ki-gor
was swifter with a snarl of pure animal
rage he leaped from the tower landed
on widespread legs before the white man
his hand shot up for a knife stroke that
would decapitate his enemy he realized
it was parson not the legless man who
trailed them

  you slimy snake he growled sway-
ing in for the kill

  no shrieked parson youre
wrong ki-gor listen to us were
friends

  parson was no worse terrified than the
others there was no fight in them with
screams for mercy four of the blacks
threw themselves on their knees parson
staggered back in an effort to get away
from the jungle man and sprawled flat
on his back not a single tatoga warrior
tried to raise a weapon

  but there was one of the blacks who
kept his feet even in that moment when
death rushed in upon him he kept his
dignity that one was the aged chief
nanooko himself he raised his right palm
in the tatoga gesture of peace

  be more just than i was o ki-gor
he said in his old mans voice

  ki-gor had purposely leaped as close
to the group as possible so that in the
bright flaring light of the reeds his dim
eyes would be able to distinguish his
enemies he recognized nanookos tones
made out indistinctly the thin frail body
which alone did not shrink from him
and the light blur against the chieftains
black body was unmistakably his palm
raised in peace

nanookos calm dignity sheered through
the white lords armor of hate it was


jungle stories

not in ki-gor to kill an old defenseless
man or warriors who groveled like sheep

  hold my pygmies he shouted let
the dangos live

  he spoke in the bare nick of time and
with less disciplined men than ngeesos
picked warriors it would have still been
too late the pygmies crashed into their
intended victims straining to divert blows
already launched and in truth they drew
blood on two of the tatoga able to avoid
fatal injuries but not flesh wounds

  then the small men leaped back ring-
ing in the tatoga their faces fierce with
disappointment an enemy was an enemy
to them and the sooner he was slain
the better

  your guards are not so brave when
they face a few blades instead of a help-
less girl spat ki-gor bitterly

  nanookos voice broke in sorrow as he
answered we wish to join you not
fight you thats why they dont give
battle

  ngeeso gave a harsh laugh what lie
is this he asked ki-gors expression
reflected the same attitude

  ive learned the truth about the one
who calls himself momba-ngar con-
fessed nanooko his eyes dropped in
shame and ive learned that sepah is
a shameless she-animal who would prey
on her dead husbands father

  he shook his head and there was even
yet a broken bewilderment about him as
though it were unbelievable that he could
be the victim of such treachery

qphese four guards are of my
a blood he explained not knowing
this the legless man assigned them to
guard him in the night they were curious
about the habits of a god and they crept
close to his hut and made small holes
in the thatch that they might see how he
conducted himself

  nanooko bit his lips gathering his
courage to say the thing

  they saw the false sepah at play with
him he went on heard the gross talk
between them their laughter at what fools
they had made of the tatoga a spark
of anger strengthened his voice they
heard her wheedling him to hurry and
slay both me and that jackal gita
parson got to his feet his face ashen

  and his hands trembling uncontrollably
his gaze showed he was still fearful of
what the white lord would do but ki-
gors attention was riveted on the old
chieftain

  if you learned the truth why didnt
you rouse your people  snapped ki-
gor has age filled your belly with
water so that you run rather than fight
for your rights

  nanooko drew himself up i was not
afraid i confronted the legless devil and
sepah like the chieftain i am

  he hesitated and the pride had gone
out of him when he resumed

  like the fool i am would be more
like it he muttered when one holds
power as long as i have he forgets that
he isnt invincible instead of first getting
my warriors on my side i burst into the
council house and shouted that i knew he
was no god but only a thieving white
man

  he put his hands across his eyes at the
memory

  the devil saw that i had found him
out and before i could speak another
word he plucked a curved throwing stick
from his belt and knocked me senseless
nanooko explained that he came to in
a hut bound and gagged with gitas
assistants guarding him

  my people thought i had gone mad
he confessed they believed his lies about
me even as i had believed the lies about
you i had no part in torturing your wife
and friends i was a prisoner in the hut
and would still be there if parson hadnt
taken advantage of the confusion you
caused to come and free me

  scorn was a whip in ki-gors voice
parson eh what caused him to change
sides so quickly

  the traders adams apple levered up
and down in his throat as he grappled
for his voice

  i didnt change sides he said ner-
vously i was with you all the time
your good words on my behalf before
nanooko sounded like it ki-gor told
him sarcastically and i suppose too that
the legless man entertains most of his
prisoners - unshackled - with beer and
food

  parson was shaking as with cold

  im a weak man ki-gor but not as
slave of the jackal priestess



bad as you think he said pleadingly i
can explain everything but for heaven
sakes let me get inside and have a drink
thats the main reason we came to the
post ive been three days without a drop
and its killing me

  the light from the torch was beginning
to falter and in its unsteady gleam ki-
gors face was bleak and forbidding as
granite

  take them all in he commanded the
pygmies well decide about them later
the four disarmed tatoga warriors
were locked in one of parsons store-
rooms nanooko and the trader were al-
lowed to remain in the main room par-
sons first move was to bring a bottle out
of a cabinet and gulp at it thirstily it
was half empty before he took it from
his lips

  he sat hunched up for several minutes
his eyes tightly closed then as though
a sudden ease came over him his tense
body relaxed and he lay back in his
chair he opened his eyes and looked
about him as if he were seeing the room
and its occupants for the first time

  these pygmies are in bad shape he
said in surprise they need treatment
by all thats holy i dont see how theyre
able to keep their feet let alone put on
a show like they just did outside

  he gave a puzzled snort and pulled
himself out of the chair

  ill get my medicine bag and see if i
cant help them he offered shouldnt
delay on things like this

  ki-gor faced him stonily

  you dont think theyd trust you to
tend their wounds do you asked ki-
gor they remember what you tried to
do to the legless man

  a queer hurt look spattered parsons
features the briskness went out of him

  oh - that he muttered he sank
down in the chair believe me thats the
only time in my life i ever did such a
thing i did it because i knew him be-
fore knew him for a long time-and i
was drunk enough to have the courage
to try what i should have done years
ago

  he picked up the bottle turned it
slowly between his palms staring into it

  hes all bad ki-gor all bad i didnt
know what he meant to do here but i

knew it would be something rotten and
evil everything he touches he corrupts
parson took a long uneven breath
hes my stepbrother he admitted
wearily youd never know to look at
the two of us that we shared the same
room ate at the same table i studied to
be a doctor he studied to be exactly what
he is his first victim was his own father
believe it or not his father made him
his partner in a firm he owned and he
stole the old man blind drove him to
bankruptcy and suicide

  he uncapped the bottle raised it to
his mouth then he hesitated and lowered
it without taking a drink ki-gor came
closer to him his brow furrowed

  he went on to bigger things then
the next i knew of him a couple of
thugs brought him to my home his legs
had been shattered by gun-fire the police
wanted him he was dying and he knew
it he begged me to save him promised
to go straight if i did

  his fingers tightened around the bottle
and with sudden haste he swigged down
a huge drink when he finished gasping
he resumed in a harder tone

  i figured hed gotten his lesson be-
sides his legs were beyond saving and
i thought a legless man was a poor bet
for a life of violence i fixed him up
hid him nursed him back to life-and
he repaid me by stealing my prescription
blanks forging my name to them and
making a big haul of narcotics

iitte used the money he got to leave

  o	the country naturally it wasnt
long before the police were on me about
all those forged blanks it came out that
i had concealed him from the law by
the time the publicity died down i was
finished as a doctor the general idea was
that i had worked in partnership with
him after all he was my brother

  i lost my license to practice medicine
had been my one love my only interest
i went to pieces fast and the bottle got
to be my only friend one day i came
out of a drunken haze to find myself on
board a vessel with duran grinning at
me he was running guns and smuggling
drugs and he needed someone to patch
up his men it amused him to have me
around as a whipping boy whenever i


jungle stories

tried to fight back hed nearly kill me
he took a perverse pleasure in having
me around him but one night a gunboat
blew us out of the water off the congo
coast i managed to get ashore and in
an effort to hide i worked my way inland
and eventually landed here i had to live
so drifted into trading

  parson fell silent his head bowed turn-
ing the bottle slowly in his fingers he
looked small and shrunken

  not a very pretty story is it he
said when ki-gor failed to comment
but maybe now youll understand why
i said what i did before nanooko and
why it pleased duran to make me drink
beer with him he forgot about me in
the confusion though and when the kraal
emptied of warriors nanookos four kins-
men and i were able to free the chief
ki-gor stood over the trader the harsh-
ness gone from his face

  fix up the pygmies parson he said
quietly and then maybe youll be good
enough to look at helene she needs your
help badly

  the trader raised his glance to the
white lord

  as badly as you do parson asked
in a voice so soft it reached ki-gors
ears alone his trained eyes hadnt missed
the jungle mans condition

  caught off-guard ki-gor was at a loss
for words for several seconds then
through set lips he said unless helene
can be saved it wont matter about me

viii

almost from the first day under
parsons care helene began to im-
prove the discredited doctor seemed to
reach back into the past and recover for
a brief period all the skill which had
once been his he poured everything in
him into the effort to make her well
fortunately ngeesos haphazard appli-
cation of the drug was as excellent an
immediate treatment as any physician
could have given her

  it was shock more than serious injury
which had brought her so close to death
with much the same effect as adrenalin
the poison had kept her heart going par-
son dosed her with an antidote which
nullified the poisonous elements which had

been undoing the good work of the drug

  within a week helene was sitting up
her strenuous outdoor life with ki-gor
had kept her in splendid physical con-
dition the lithe strong jungle girl swift-
ly recovered her vigor and she kept im-
proving despite the fact that increasing
danger of discovery made it necessary
for the small band to leave the post and
hide in the jungle shifting position every
night

  but parson didnt meet with the same
success with ki-gor daily the darkness
gathered deeper about the jungle man and
the brief periods in which he could see
grew fewer

  i wont mislead you parson said
that blow you took on the head appar-
ently jarred the delicate optic nerves per-
haps with rest your eyes will adjust them-
selves of their own accord then again
it may require a surgeon far more skilled
than i am to correct the trouble

  he stopped uneasily his manner in-
dicating there was more he wanted to
say ki-gor finished for him

  but its possible i may never see at
all the white lord declared thats
really what youre trying to tell me isnt
it

  now dont jump to conclusions par-
son soothed unconvincingly guessing how
disturbed ki-gor was behind his mask
of calmness i actually dont know how
serious it is this is out of my field and
i just have to feel my way along

  but to helene the two chieftains and
theirs warriors parson was franker

  weve got to keep ki-gor quiet he
warned its my belief that his extreme
exertions after his head injury greatly
harmed him if he gets in another brush
with the tatoga or tries to make the fast
hard trek necessary to get us out of the
tatoga area it may make him permanent-
ly blind

  ngeeso listened soberly his own war-
riors werent in proper condition to run
the tatoga gauntlet but the small chieftain
had been scouting their immediate locality
and he knew that duran suddenly was
pouring more and more men into the
jungle around them

  it means certain death if we dont
leave now protested one of nanookos
men who had scouted with ngeeso we
slave of the jackal priestess



cant evade that devils trackers forever
i say we should make a run for it

  we stay with ki-gor nanooko said
fastening the man with a cold look let
no more be said about it

  well spoken commended ngeeso
you have a lions heart old one

  the warrior subsided under nanookos
stern glance lowered his eyes sullenly
though he didnt dare argue further it
was obvious the chieftains words didnt sit
well with him

  as good steel will rust if constantly
exposed to dampness mused ngeeso
to himself so at times will a mans
courage crumble if exposed for too long
a period to danger i must keep an eye
on that warrior

  but too many other matters demanded
ngeesos attention for him to constantly
watch one man because of nanookos
age it was up to the pygmy to direct the
party keep it hidden and try to secure
enough food twice tatoga patrols al-
most stumbled on them and it was clear
from the searchers manner that they knew
their quarry was close

  steadily the tension gripping the fugi-
tives grew

  the pygmies had replaced their lost
blowguns and brewed a new supply of
poison and parson had brought along
his rifle from the trading post but they
couldnt hope to offer more than a brief
show of resistance against the swarming
tatoga

  it was the second afternoon after the
conference that ngeeso discovered that
nanookos kinsman disappeared a glance
at their meager stores of food and water
showed that the man had taken all he
could carry

  the shocked nanooko stormed about
in a rage feeling it was a personal dis-
grace that a man of his blood should
play the coward

  parson was not so harsh in his judg-
ment as the two chieftains fear rots
many a man he said looking at the
ground anyway one person more or
less wont make any difference in our
chances if were attacked and the fact
he took supplies shows he isnt going over
to the enemy

  ngeeso looked across to the place
where ki-gor lay with his eyes bandaged

no explanation parson could make would
soften his opinion of the deserter

  its not as easily dismissed as that
ngeeso said grimly in trying to save
his own worthless life hes thrown away
all our chances a snake couldnt wriggle
past the tatoga let alone that blundering
fool two days ago he might have made it
but not now and once hes captured the
legless man will learn our position
nanooko nodded unhappy agreement
and suggested that they move immedi-
ately

  were probably too late already
judged ngeeso but its the only thing
we have left to do

  before ngeeso could finish giving the
men their orders helene came up say-
ing the white lord wished to speak
with him

  whats wrong ki-gor abruptly
questioned

  though ngeeso had tried to shield
ki-gor from as much worry as possible
in this instance he didnt try to hide the
seriousness of their situation

  one of nanookos men has deserted
he explained i thought it wise for us
to move in case he is captured

  no it isnt that ki-gor said some-
things wrong in the jungle listen to
that troop of baboons going full speed
through the trees and off to the right
hear those bush buck crashing through
the undergrowth

absorbed in getting the party ready
to travel ngeeso hadnt paid any
attention to the growing animal noises
about the camp but now that he lis-
tened he noted that a kind of panic
seemed to be spreading among the jungles
denizens flocks of birds passed above
them and in the distance came the re-
peated roars of disturbed jungle rats

  no number of men milling about could
so disturb the forest he said with a
baffled air its very strange

  ki-gor stood up first listening then
sniffing the sluggish humid air he made
no effort to remove the thick bandage from
his eyes he accepted the fact that if
ngeeso could see nothing wrong then
his own dim vision certainly would be
of no value in finding a solution

  this is the wrong time of year for


jungle stories

the dingo packs he said referring to
the vicious wild dogs which ran amok
during the dry season and the noise
is too widespread to be caused by driver
ants a muscle worked in his cheek and
his voice suddenly quickened it can be
but one thing

  eh grunted ngeeso still puzzled

  the forest is aflame ki-gor said
thats whats driving the animals in
upon us from so many directions the
fire still is far off but we must be ringed
in by it

  consternation gripped ngeeso this
was a terror he hadnt expected and it
was a moment before he could rally his
thoughts how could that be he asked-

  the legless man is taking no further
chances on our eluding him said the
white lord hes learned our approxi-
mate location from the deserter and means
to drive us from hiding its an old trick
well find one avenue left open through
the ring of fire thats where hell be
waiting to scoop us in

  and within two hours ki-gors pre-
diction proved true ngeeso scouted the
area with four men and found solid walls
of flame advancing in upon them from
every side only a narrow corridor to
the south wasnt burning this one avenue
was a rocky treeless canyon broad enough
to leave a safe path even though the
jungle on either side of it was an in-
ferno not one of durans warriors re-
mained within the fire-encircled area
which was added proof that the trap was
his carefully prepared handiwork

  by morning the flames were so close
that the small band was forced to retreat
toward the canyon over and over
ngeeso tried to find some break in
those burning walls but each time he
returned red-eyed and coughing to throw
himself down in a weary discouraged
heap when he caught his breath he
would move the party nearer the corridor
where duran waited and then set out once
again on his hopeless tour

  but finally even the indomitable little
chieftain had to give up hope always
before in tight places he had been able
to look to the white lord for leadership
this time the full burden had fallen to
him and he felt his failure to get the
party to safety was a mark of personal

inadequacy he felt he had betrayed his
friends

  with drooping shoulders he stood apart
from his companions watching the rolling
curtain of smoke advance toward them
seeing behind the murky clouds the red
burst of flame where trees and bushes
caught fire in intense heat helene guessed
ngeesos feelings and left her mate to
go and stand beside the little man

  when he became aware of her presence
he raised his tired lined face the white
lord would have found a way out for
us he said in bitter self-condemnation

  if you couldnt no one could helene
told him youve done everything pos-
sible ki-gor knows that

  her words were no balm to ngeeso
were he able to see even now he could
think of something yet i stand like a clod
helpless worthless waiting for death to
take us all

  helene was silent for a bit she closed
her eyes clenched her small fists tightly
there were flecks of fear in her blue eyes
when she opened them and her lips trem-
bled

  perhaps there is yet a way she said
huskily wait here until i see after all
im the one the legless man wants to
capture most and he wants me alive

  she took a long look at ki-gor and
then started at a run down the canyon
immersed in his own thoughts ngeeso
dully watched her then abruptly her
words struck into his mind

  too late her meaning dawned on him
helene went to bargain with duran offer
to give herself up if he would let ki-gor
and her black friends pass through his
lines unharmed knowing her pride and
will duran would realize that if he re-
fused her offer he would never take her
alive

  no helene shouted ngeeso come
back

  he shouted again and again

  but helene only sped faster she rea-
soned that in their present position all
would die but if she could bargain with
duran then perhaps her life alone would
be forfeited she meant to die in either
case for she had no intention of going
through with the great marriage ceremony
which the legless man had promised the
jungle as soon as her party was safe
slave of the jackal priestess



she meant to kill herself rather than
become gitas bride

  ki-gor heard ngeesos frightened cry
was told by the men about him that
helene had raced down the canyon with
ngeeso sprinting in pursuit he didnt
understand what she intended but he
knew duran waited in that direction

he tore the bandage from his eyes
wincing with the sudden pain of
the light and smoke he could see dimly
for a distance of about ten feet but be-
yond that the grey mist blotted out every-
thing

  after them he roared angry that
the stunned men hadnt rushed to in-
vestigate run ahead of me one of you
so ill know which way to go

  but your eyes   began parson

  never mind thundered the white
lord somethings wrong with helene

  parson argued no further after all
they had little time left to live so what
did it matter he flipped the safety catch
off his rifle and leaped ahead of ki-gor
himself this would be a better way for
them to go than to sit and wait for the
fire

  with parson and ki-gor in the lead
the handful of warriors ran after helene
it was easy going at first but after
about two hundred yards they came up
against a dense swirling cloud of smoke

a-jungle stories--spring

the fire had advanced to that point along
the upper rims of the canyon and though
the rocky canyon was free of burning
brush the thick smoke poured down into
the hollow place bridged it with a moving
black wall which kept pace with the
flames above

  stumbling and choking they managed
to get through the pall as they entered
fresh air again they almost ran over
ngeeso he was on his knees gripped
in an agony of coughing his long efforts
to find a way out of the trap that day
had exposed him to the flame and smoke
so much that his lungs and eyes were
terribly irritated

  in trying to follow helene he had
run against a rock and had fallen in the
smoke cloud a coughing fit had seized
him and he had gotten turned around
losing her completely and barely finding
his own way to the open air still ill he
got up and went on with the group

  helenes voice came echoing down the
canyon to them before they could see
her she was telling duran she would
give herself up if he would let the others
through to safety whereas if he refused
she would throw herself in the flames

  doesnt she realize hell promise any-
thing to get his hands on her swore
parson bitterly his word means noth-
ing he wouldnt let us go under any
circumstances

  and in immediate confirmation of the


jungle stories

traders words duran spoke from the
place where his warriors were entrenched

  now thats what i call real sensible
of you honey he said in his oily taunt-
ing accents sure ill let the others go
free just walk right on over here and
the bargains sealed the rest of the bunch
dont mean anything to me

  helene was accustomed to the fact that
the most savage and cunning black man
would keep his word to the letter once
he gave it she expected duran to keep
his promise but since his men were bound
to be on edge after days of pursuit she
wanted to take no chances of a sudden
incident flaring between the two rival
groups

  pull your men out of the canyon
helene directed have them stand up
and start walking toward the mouth ill
follow keeping this same distance when
we get outside ill give up

  this second stipulation didnt sit well
with duran but helene obstinately in-
sisted there was a long silence from the
tatoga line and then abruptly the legless
man agreed

  he appeared from behind a huge rock
he was mounted on one of the zebra
from other points four more mounted
men rode they turned up the canyon at
a walk as they rode black men crawled
out of holes and from behind rocks to
follow them on foot

  after a bit duran turned his head
saw that helene hadnt moved well
come on he said harshly what more
do you want

  she started forward matching her pace
to that of the retreating warriors so she
would keep exactly the same safe distance
from them until they were out of the
canyon

  helene had advanced two-thirds of the
way to the position just vacated by
durans warriors when ki-gor and par-
son rounded a turn in the canyon behind
her and came in sight they had heard
the exchange between the girl and duran
and now parson told ki-gor that she was
following the tatoga

  come back here helene shouted the
white lord youre insane to think you
can trust that jackal

like a reaching hand her husbands
words caught and turned helene it was-

because of her unselfish love for the
straight tall jungle man that she did this
thing she had gambled that he wouldnt
learn her intent until it was too late for
him to interfere now fear of what he
would do deep-carved her face

  leave me alone she sobbed im do-
ing whats right its one life paid to
save many and just because im a woman
is no reason my life should be more
valuable than yours

  parson and ki-gorcame on at a dead
run paying no heed to her

  stop him parson she pleaded this
is the only way the legless man is pulling
out his warriors there wont be any
fighting if you keep away

  but even as she spoke the fact that
duran had never intended to keep his
word became clearly apparent from the
supposedly deserted tatoga entrenchment
leaped the wizard gita and two of his
assistants duran had left them there to
capture the trusting girl his apparent
withdrawal was for the sole purpose of
bringing her within the witch-doctors
reach

  the three blacks fearful that ki-gor
would keep them from trapping helene
darted from concealment and sped up be-
hind the girl in the confusion helene
failed to hear the quick spatter of their
bare feet but parson saw his brothers
expected treachery and snarled the news
to ki-gor 

  can we reach her before they do
asked ki-gor unable to see his mate

  we cant declared parson but bul-
lets can

  with that he slid to a stop raised his
rifle and fired the first shot whined
harmlessly up the canyon duran began
screaming to his warriors to turn and
charge then the legless man whirled his
zebra and followed by his fotir mounted
guards came racing back toward helene

parson was steadier on his second
shot and sent one of the witchdoctors
to his knees with his face blasted away
that was enough for the cowardly gita
he spun around deserting his assistant
and fled parson wasted valuable mo-
ments trying to draw a certain bead on
the chief wizard but in his nervousness
he missed the moving target before he
slave of the jackal priestess



could throw another cartridge in the
chamber ki-gors powerful body sprinted
between him and gita

  the white lord had kept running
when the trader stopped

  gitas assistant reached the red-haired
girl unaware that his chief had turned
tail helene fought him with all the
strength in her slim body scratching and
kicking to keep him from lifting her
from her feet

  the assistant struck at helene trying
to knock her senseless so he could get
her away before the white lord reached
them but helene was like an eel in his
grasp she twisted around locked a leg
behind his and sent them both tumbling
to the ground she kept crying out to
ki-gor knowing he could find her only
by the sound of her voice

  abruptly realizing that gita had left
him alone to face ki-gor the blacks
courage evaporated he beat helene away
in panic and scrambled to his knees mean-
ing to run for it the white lord was
plunging in upon them bent forward as
he ran his eyes wide and staring as he
sought to see

  into ki-gors fading range of vision
came the sight of the black man hitting
helene a deep animal growl of rage
burst from his throat and his great hands
reached to scoop the black from the
ground oblivious of the charging tatoga
or the enraged duran spurring ahead of
his forces ki-gor caught the man by
throat and crotch and jerked him into
the air

  then just as he would break a piece
of kindling the white lord brought the
shrilly screaming black crashing down on
his leg with one blow he splintered the
witchdoctors spine then he straightened
raised the jerking body high overhead and
hurled it to the ground with bone-crushing
force

  parson reached ki-gor firing as he
ran ill get him ill get that murdering
devil he kept muttering hysterically but
the traders hands were jerking and trem-
bling and he shot wilder with every
bullet

  in utter scorn of the traders gun duran
came on at a gallop one of the odd-
shaped throwing sticks was in his right
hand helene caught at ki-gors arm

crying to him in the rising din to try to
escape back down the canyon her eyes
glistened with tears as she realized that
actually there was no hope of his getting
away in trying to save him she had
only succeeded in hastening his death

  its my fault ki-gor she mourned
i wanted to save you i love you so
her voice broke

  ki-gor felt for her blindly his exer-
tions had once more plunged him into
blackness he caught her against him and
his mouth found hers then he shoved
her away behind him and turned toward
the sound of the tatoga

  ki-gors pitiful handful of followers
had faltered at the sight of the thronging
tatoga ngeeso frenziedly cursed them
trying to force them to close ranks around
helene but it made no difference that
they never reached her

  duran gave a savage yell and threw
his curved stick with deadly accuracy
the heavy piece of wood smashed against
parsons throat spun the mortally injured
trader over in a jerking heap the first
throwing stick was hardly launched be-
fore duran caught another in his hairy
fist and sent it hurtling at the blind white
lord

 helene screamed knowing ki-gor
without his sight had no chance to escape
the missile ki-gor whirled at the sound
of her voice thinking a tatoga had
reached his mate he didnt move in time
to wholly escape the blow but he did
turn just enough so that the stick hit
glancingly tearing open the old wound
on his forehead had the curved wood
struck as duran intended it would have
sheared off the upper part of his skull

  ki-gor staggered his hands starting
to reach toward his face then his arms
dropped leadenly and he fell in his tracks
a wash of scarlet covering his features
helenes torfured scream mingled with
durans roar of triumph

  he clung atop his mount like a gro-
tesque monster his lips sheered back with
animal viciousness as he thundered down
on the helpless girl he leaned in the
saddle and reaching with one huge arm
swept helene from her feet at a full
gallop then he turned the zebra expertly
cutting away to avoid ngeesos men

  his four mounted guards drove straight


jungle stories

on crashing at full tilt into the pygmies
and nanookos men before the small
group could recover the tatoga footmen
were on them in one swift swirling
minute it was over the flood of warriors
closed over the tiny band and when it
was finished only ngeeso and nanooko
still lived they emerged with their lives
merely because duran had ordered them
saved for a more spectacular execution
at the time of the wedding ceremony

the legless man refused to let helene
go to ki-gor he had guards hold
her then he rode over to where the
body of his step brother lay his brutal
face didnt change expression as he stared
down at the frail broken figure of the
man he actually had destroyed long be-
fore this day

  he turned the zebra so he could see
ki-gor his loose mouth twisted in a
cruel smile his victory was complete

  the cur still breathes he announced
hell make a pretty sight burning on
a stake before the cave of death that
should be a worthwhile lesson to others
who think to oppose momba-ngar

  the pygmies had slain three of durans
mounted guards with their poison darts
so the legless man had ki-gor tied across
one of the riderless zebra on another
he had helene placed with her hands tied
behind her

 you look worn down honey he
sneered i want to take good care of
you after all pretty soon well be the
only two whites left among these savages
so we better start sticking together he
guffawed at his sadistic joke

  helene had borne all she could stand
maddened with grief she staggered with
a kick the black who held her zebras
reins she dug her heels into the ponys
sides the half-wild animal gave two leaps
and crashed against durans mount

  struck broadside the legless mans pony
was knocked from its feet and fell hard
duran was catapulted from the saddle
and went rolling and bouncing across the
ground like a great barrel it happened so
quickly and unexpectedly that not one
of his men had a chance to interfere

  when she first acted helenes sole object
was to hurt or maim duran the legless
man had been holding the reins to ki-

gors zebra but he turned these loose
as his pony went down the animal on
which ki-gor was tied whirled in fright
scattering the men who stood around it
helene instantly saw an opportunity to
cheat duran of his triumph

  her animal shaken by the collision
reeled back on its haunches helene kicked
it into motion started up the canyon to-
wards the fire she swept past ki-gors
mount and as she knew it would it
stampeded after her with a ringing clatter
of hooves the two striped beasts tore a
way through the loose crowd and broke
into the open

  stop them came durans infuriated
roar shoot down those zebra you gaping
fools

  arrows were flung into a score of bows
but before a single bowman could fire
a brawny black took two great running
leaps and cast his spear the black shaft
cut a thin quick arc through the air and
slashed into the right hind leg of helenes
pony

  the hamstrung zebra toppled as its leg
gave way helene went diving from its
back twisting in mid-air to land sitting
down in a patch of sand the other zebra
drove past within two feet of her going
at a full gallop

  the air was suddenly full of whirring
arrows as the tatoga sought to bring
down the second animal before it got out
of range an arrow dug into the crea-
tures haunches serving only to whip it to
greater speed three more barbs struck
almost together one digging into its side
inches from ki-gors head the zebra
faltered for a second then recovered its
stride and disappeared around the bend

  after him commanded duran that
wounded zebra cant carry him long

  helene sank down on her face in thei
sand she was too exhausted and beaten
to fight any more whether the frightened
zebra carried ki-gor into the flames or
whether duran recaptured him the white
lord was forever lost to her

ix

ki-gor swam up through darkness
a vague worrisome murmuring of
voices stirred him to try to gather his
senses then the sharp pain in his head
slave of the jackal priestess



struck him held him paralyzed for an
interval

  by the time the pain eased he was
wholly conscious there was the taste of
blood in his mouth and he could feel it
streaming over his face he recognized
durans voice but before he could wholly
understand what had happened a sudden
commotion broke around him he heard
the swift clatter of hooves the impact
of two heavy bodies colliding and felt
the animal under him give a surging leap

  he clung desperately with arms and
legs to the heaving zebra as it bucked
twice and then broke into a run the
pounding heaving motion brought a wave
of sickness his head seemed about to
burst then he lost consciousness again

  when ki-gor came to the second time
smoke seared his nostrils the zebra had
stopped running it stood wide-legged its
head down slowly dying from the arrow
wounds inflicted by the tatoga the ani-
mal had run through the canyon and kept
going until it spent the last of its waning
strength trying to find a way through the
flames

  great rasping breaths shook the zebra
its muscles trembled violently the fore-
legs gave way first and seconds later the
hind legs collapsed with an almost gentle
motion the zebra rolled over on its side
pinning ki-gor in a near sitting position
with the weight of the creatures midsec-
tion on his lap

  that crushing weight on his legs shocked
ki-gor alert he had to free his bonds
soon or he was finished

  without thinking he pressed his face
against the zebra to wipe the blood from
his eyes then he raised his head and
looked about him thick smoke lay every-
where and a roaring crackling line of
fire moved in toward him the zebra had
carried him back into the fire trap

  he was estimating how much time he
had before the fire reached him when
suddenly he realized he was seeing the
smoking heat-ravaged forest with utmost
clarity his sight more nearly normal than
it had been at any time since the original
head injury but remembering how swiftly
and completely the blindness could over-
take him he tried not to waste a single
precious moment

  i must hurry he kept telling himself

in desperation if the blindness comes
before i get free ill never get away

  he strained to break the bonds on his
wrists only to learn the true extent of
his weakness his powerful body had ab-
sorbed punishment which would have
killed even most strong men but he had
driven it to its outermost limit and it
could go no further he gasped for breath
while the feeling of a trapped animal
pressed in upon him

  when he started to resume the strug-
gles which he knew beforehand were use-
less his eye fell on the feathered shaft
of one of the arrows buried in the zebra
it had stabbed low in the ponys belly and
by working his hands and feet as far to
the left as possible he brought his fingers
to the shaft with infinite difficulty he
tugged the barb out of the flesh then
he reversed it pressing the feathered end
back into the wound so that the point
stuck upward in the air

  he held the thongs binding his wrists
against the sharp edges of the arrow-
heading sawing them up and down sweat
ran off his face and shoulders in rivulets
it was agonizingly slow work for the
arrow kept turning under the pressure
a burning tree came crashing down its
flaming branches reaching to within fifteen
yards of the white lord the fire ran
outward from the tree like a yellow
stream lighting the surrounding brush

  ki-gor kept himself at his task and
finally the bonds shredded apart he tore
the thongs from his wrists braced his
hands against the inert zebra and worked
his feet free sparks had set the grass
about him to smouldering so with his
ankles still bound he had to crawl to a
safer point before he could stop to untie
the last of the knots

  he tried to think where he might find
haven from both the flames and the ta-
toga at the rate it was going the fire
would reach the canyon within a few more
hours surely if there was any safe place
for a man to hide ngeeso would have
found it he thought of how delighted
duran would be to see him driven back
into the canyon and he swore to himself
that hed die before letting himself go
back and surrender

  unable to arrive at any plan he stum-
bled haphazardly through the smoke-filled


jungle stories

jungle putting as much distance as pos-
sible between him and the dead zebra
the tatoga would follow the zebras
tracks in the hope of recapturing him his
mouth and throat were parched and with
every passing minute his thirst grew more
unendurable

  this thirst is one torment i dont
have to suffer he hold himself there
had been a small spring near their camp
at least i can drink my fill a last
time

  twice he had to hide to avoid tatoga
searching parties and he was almost done
for when he finally stumbled through the
abandoned camp and went on a hundred
yards to locate the spring he fell on
his stomach and buried his face in the
cold fresh water when he had drunk
his fill he plunged his arms full length
into the coolness then he sat up put
his legs into the spring and gradually
slid his whole body into the small clear
basin

to his surprise the water came up
to his chin he hadnt thought the
spring was more than three feet deep
he found also that the basin was shaped
like a small-necked bottle with the area
beneath the surface mushrooming out into
a roomy chamber where the water had
worn a softer strata of rock away

  he climbed out of the spring stood
lost in deep thought for a moment a
man might survive the fire if he could
manage to stay at the bottom of that
cold water until the timber around the
place was burned out the spring flowed
enough to keep the water from boiling

  ki-gors lips set in a hard determined
line he hurried back to the camp picked
up three extra blowguns left by the pyg-
mies found a tatoga knife which one
of them had carried as a souvenir and
gathered up the remains of their food
stock then he hid in the brush near the
spring and waited

  within an hour the fire had crept so
close he had to get in the water he
watched the trees and brush about him
begin to burn and then closing his lips
tightly about the mouthpiece of a blow-
gun he sat down on the bottom of the
spring leaving the other end of the hol-
low reedlike blowgun protruding about

an inch above the water by breathing
slowly enough to give the hot air time to
cool slightly before reaching his lungs
he would be able to survive

  his body grew cold and cramped in
the chill water at first but as the heat
of the forest fire grew more intense the
spring became lukewarm he lost track
of time giving his whole attention to
getting sufficient oxygen into his aching
lungs when the air he breathed no longer
burned his throat and the water about
him began to grow chill he thrust his
head above the surface

  two hours later he was able to wet
down the bank climb out and lie down
about him on every side were smoulder-
ing fires beds of hot coals and acres of
white ash despite the heat the exhausted
white lord fell into a deep sleep as
soon as he stretched out

  it was mid-morning of the next day
before he awakened he was entirely
alone in that eerie sea of desolation he
breakfasted on the food which he had
placed in the spring opening with his
knife two cans which had come from
parsons stock and rounding out the meal
with fruit and nuts

  he ate not because he was hungry but
to regain his strength he sat dejectedly
for a long time trying to figure out what
he should do he wasnt certain whether
ngeeso had survived the tatoga charge
but he knew duran wouldnt kill helene
it seemed hopeless for him to go alone
to the tatoga kraal but he could think
of no other course to follow

  a single item brightened his dark out-
look the blindness hadnt returned his
eyes smarted from the exposure to smoke
and water and his head wound pained
him badly but his sight remained clear
parsons treatment might have taken ef-
fect or perhaps just as the former doctor
said could happen ki-gors eyes had
finally readjusted themselves but the
white lord felt the second blow on the
head actually was what had restored his
sight

  he moved cautiously at first but he
found no sign of the tatoga it was
natural they should believe he had perished
in the fire his anxiety about helene
pushed him to greater boldness and he
began to travel openly instead of slowly
slave of the jackal priestess



creeping from the cover of one rock to
another

  when he reached the site of the battle
he halted surprised the bodies of his
dead friends had been placed in a neat
line and covered with rocks it was a
gesture one wouldnt expect from duran
ki-gor stood by the graves gripped by
sorrow

  behind him sounded the faint rattle of
loose gravel stirred by a footstep jerked
from his reverie his face went abruptly
savage as he spun knife in hand to meet
his stalkers the tatoga had set a clever
trap but they would learn how dear was
the cost of closing it

  he was a murderous ravening killer
in that moment as he turned with that
incredible speed of his he saw the line
of tall powerfully built warriors standing
like statues he snarled and leaped
straight at them knowing he must strike
quickly before he was overwhelmed

  then abruptly his heels dug into the
earth he stopped a queer shaken look
coming over him he blinked dully his
knife arm slowly sinking to his side

  the men were masai warriors

  they were his friends from the far
jungle they were the congos most feared
warriors whose steel legions had broken
every tribe that had ever stood against
them

  and standing like an ebony giant among
them was the greatest of the masai war-
dogs their almost legendary leader the
huge-thewed tembu george

  ki-gor was stunned speechless for a
moment times without number during
past weeks he had wished for these men
about him now like an incredible dream
come true they stood before him

  how did you know to come  he cried
his voice hoarse with sudden feeling

  he saw tembu georges eyes widen
saw how tense and strained were the mens
faces they watched him with a strange
fascination but not one of them made a
move toward him not one of them spoke

  whats wrong ki-gor asked per-
turbed why do you look at me so
queerly dont you know me

tembu george swallowed hard
there was a nervous tremor in his
deep bass as he finally spoke aye we

know you o ghost-of-the-white lord
we captured a prisoner who told us how
you were burned in the fire and how
these brave ones were slain by the legless
man that is how we knew to come and
bury them we had just finished when we
heard your footsteps we hid and saw you
coming from your death-place in the em-
bers

  comprehension dawned on ki-gor he
looked down at himself every inch of
his body was covered with fine white
ash

  go to your rest o ghost-of-the-white
lord continued tembu george we
have come with our little brothers the
pygmies to avenge you

  not one of those black men doubted
that he looked upon ki-gors ghost this
white-shrouded figure had come out of the
smoking desolation come straight to the
graves of his dead fellows the masai
were unnerved but a combination of love
and curiosity had brought them out of
hiding to stare at the spirit of their de-
parted friend

  a relieved grin touched ki-gors dusty
features hai he exclaimed so it takes
a ghost to frighten a good word out of
you about ki-gor well wipe away those
crocodile tears you great-footed children
because whether you like it or not im
not a ghost

  he strode up to the tense tembu
george caught the big black in his arms
and hugged him

  is a ghosts body warm and solid
he chuckled does a spirit wipe ashes
all over you and nearly break your weak
back with his grasp

  tembu georges jaw dropped then he
bellowed for joy he caught ki-gor and
mauled him with elephantine roughness
shouting all the while to his warriors
he lives by all the gods ki-gor lives
before he could get a word out of them
about themselves he had to explain the
seeming miracle of his survival then they
dragged out of him the whole grim tale
of his struggle with the legless man final-
ly they explained their own presence

  the white devil and the wizard gita
overplayed themselves grimly rumbled
tembu george when they had their
drums boast to the jungle how they had
defeated you how as a sign of contempt


jungle stories

gita would take your woman in mar-
riage

  another masai tapped ki-gors chest
with his knuckles said meaningfully
they forgot the power of your name
he meant that any other drum message
would have died after it reached its in-
tended listeners which in this case were
the tatogas neighboring tribes

  interrupting each other the warriors
explained how the message had leaped
from kraal to kraal speeding out over the
congo covering in hours distances re-
quiring days to travel on foot durans
ignorance of the jungle and gitas burst-
ing vanity had served to make the mis-
take the message had gone far beyond
the tribes the two criminals sought to
impress

  we heard tembu george said sim-
ply and before the drums had finished
talking our boats were on the river

  he did not see fit to explain that they
had left a trail of fear-paralyzed peoples
behind them for the masai and the pyg-
mies had moved like lightning keeping
as much as possible to the rivers and
threatening every tribe along the way with
utter devastation if they allowed news of
the invasion to leak out that had served
to keep the drums quiet and they had
moved too fast for word of mouth gossip
to get ahead of them

  we traveled all last night using the
forest fire as a beacon the masai chief-
tain revealed when we arrived this
morning most of the tatoga were gone
we caught several prisoners one of them
an assistant of gitas he claims the mar-
riage will be held this afternoon my men
prepare to attack when the tatoga gather
for the ceremony

  by the time they reached the pygmy
and masai army ki-gor and tembu
george had worked out a detailed plan
of attack the white lord went among
the warriors selecting four hundred men
half pygmies and half masai then tak-
ing along gitas assistant he led this
picked force on ahead of the main body

  he had the tatoga prisoner lead them
to the bluff overlooking the ceremonial
grounds a scowl from tembu george
had sufficed to make the man reveal the
secret of the waterfall a huge earthen
dam with an outlet which could be closed

to shut off the flow of water there also
was an opening into the cave of death
descending from the bluff

  they captured three more of gitas men
at the bluff they were the assistants
entrusted with cutting off the waterfall
when the chief wizard went into his mum-
bo-jumbo act before the cave mouth ki-
gor left three of his own men to operate
the dam and led the others down into the
cave

  he made the witchdoctors show him
where gita had hidden the stone image
of momba-ngar then he had his war-
riors drag it back to the front of the
cave replace it on its pedestal

  they waited restively behind the thun-
dering curtain of water until afternoon
then as their first signal that the ceremony
was beginning outside they heard the
sound of the falls decrease ki-gor drew
the men back far enough so that the
darkness and swirling mists would hide
them from view he lined them up in
regular ranks ten abreast

  ki-gors hands gripped tight on his
borrowed masai bow as he strained to see
through the dwindling waters to the open
space beyond at last the fall stopped
he saw the black swarming mass of the
tatoga lit by bright sunshine they formed
a huge semi-circle before the cave mouth
and in the hollow space in front of them
was a sight which sent hot rage burning
through the -white lords veins

  two stakes surrounded with dry fire-
wood had been set up fifty yards apart
ngeeso was tied to one of the stakes
nanooko to the other a witchdoctor with
a flaming torch stood by each pile of
wood

  between the stakes stood helene and
gita helens ankles and wrists were bound
by silver chains and as an added indignity
a silver collar had been placed around her
neck joined to another chain which the
pompous gila held in his hand

facing the huge throng with his
back to the cave was the legless man
mounted on a zebra sepah stood beside
him with arrogant pride reveling in her
prominence by the very set of durans
shoulders ki-gor could see how he sav-
ored this moment of triumph the neigh-
boring chieftains were in the forefront of
slave of the jackal priestess



the crowd and their frightened faces
showed that already they were awed by
the dread leader of the tatoga

  light the fires roared duran let
the cries of these two as they roast be
a warning to those who would oppose
momba-ngar and when they have
shrieked their last then shall the marriage
of gita and this woman who once be-
longed to the weakling ki-gor be con-
sidered sealed

  the white lord strode out of the dark-
ness of the cave into the bright glare of
sunlight on the wet rock he raised his
bow and with swift deadliness lashed an
arrow at the black who bent to light
ngeesos pyre the missile caught the
man in the side threw him over on his
back the torch fell on the natives chest
and he bucked wildly trying to get out
from under the flame

  before the first man fell ki-gor turned
his attention to the witchdoctor leaning
to fire the wood abut nanooko he drove
an arrow through the blacks skull so
that his body fell forward on the exact
place where he had held his torch

  ki-gor slid a third arrow into his
bow the whole attention of the crowd
had been so fixed on the legless man that
hardly a black had previously glanced at
the cave but now like a giant dull-witted
monster with unnumbered eyes the vast
throng saw ki-gor and momentarily
froze not a tongue seemed to move

  look you on the true image of momba-
ngar behind me shouted ki-gor and
know you have turned against your chief-
tain your friends and yourselves for a
rotten evil killer who is no more a god
than the mangiest dango

  gita stood with bulging eyes staring
at the unbelievable sight of a dead man
appearing out of nowhere to strike down
men with his bow then he made a leap
trying to get behind helene but for all
his strange unearthly calm the white
lord was too fast for the wizard he
spitted gita on an arrow like the pig he
was twirled him over as he leaped so
that he died beside the girl he thought
to possess

  duran had turned in his saddle as
thunderstruck as the others his face
went hideous with hate when he saw
the white lord once more ki-gor had

wriggled through his hands returned to
shake the belief of the natives in him
duran didnt suspect that ki-gor had
allies but thought this was only one more
example of his audacity

  he lies screamed the furious duran
this is another sneaking trick by which
he tries to cheat you of glory and riches
forward guards this time we will slay
the cur before the eyes of the crowd and
make certain he is dead

  a confused uproar broke from the
tatoga some among them perhaps had
sudden doubts about the legless man but
few could think straight in that moment
they had grown used to obeying the leg-
less man and he had cunningly cast his
spell of evil over them buying their loy-
alty with his promises of the greatness
which was to be theirs in a choice between
ki-gor and duran it was duran alone
who offered them tangible benefits for
following him

  the legless man swung his zebra and
spurred at ki-gor tearing a throwing
stick from the belt at his waist as he rode
he crouched low so the zebras head and
neck would protect him from ki-gors
arrows behind him his personal guard
rushed forward at a run and warriors
broke out of the crowd to follow them

  seeing this vast mass of men rushing
in upon the white lord helene screamed
to him to get away she too thought her
beloved mate had come alone

  if ki-gor heard helenes voice he gave
no sign unmoving he waited his nar-
rowed eyes fastened on the zebra the
bow in his hands was bent to its further-
most point the arrow straining for re-
lease

  he saw the legless man suddenly rear
up his right hand flung high for the
cast this time duran wasnt pitted against
a blind man ki-gor shot so swiftly he
hardly seemed to aim he easily could have
killed duran but he didnt only the feel
of his fingers around the legless mans
throat would satisfy the white lord in-
stead of inflicting a fatal wound he shat-
tered durans wrist so that the throwing
stick fell harmlessly to the ground

  duran was almost on ki-gor then
spurring the zebra with insane rage ki-
gor held the bow like a club he ham-
mered the pony across the head causing


jungle stories

it to swerve slightly then he came up
with a great bound caught duran in his
arms and dragged him from the saddle

  they rolled over and over on the wet
slippery rock beating and tearing at each
other with insensate fury the grotesque
brutish duran fought with the strength
of a bull ape but there was no denying
the stored-up rage which fired the white
lord with superhuman strength

  ki-gor hammered the mans hideous
bullet head with rocking blows gouging
away skin and flesh each time he struck
then with the speed of a cobra his hands
shot around durans thick neck ki-gor
rolled to his knees the tremendous muscles
of his back and shoulders swelling with
the killing pressure he exerted

   durans guards sprinted across the rock
bridge racing to break the white lords
death-hold they dared not throw their
spears for fear of killing their master
then out of the mist-shrouded darkness
of the cave charged ki-gors men

  the bluff shook with their thunderous
battle-cry as they smashed into the startled
tatoga guards and like a tremendous
earth-shattering echo from the far end
of the clearing came the answering battle-
cry of the main force of pygmy and
masai warriors

  like a grain field whipped by storm
the tatoga shuddered under the impact
of that coordinated attack they had no
chance to rally or make a stand against
those wild cheering warriors pouring in
upon them the tatoga horde splintered
apart and into every avenue that opened
drove the huge fierce masai and the
deadly pygmies

so fierce an onslaught could not long
be endured those tatoga fortunate
enough to get away fled for their lives
into the forest but the great bulk of them
threw down their arms and surrendered

  ki-gor stood wide-legged at the edge
of the cave watching the finish of the
battle his muscles trembled with weak-
ness now that his rage had died out at
his feet lay the body of the legless man
devoid at last of the evil spirit which
had brought ruin and death to so many
the blue distorted face and protruding
tongue proclaimed the manner of his
dying

  a squad of the men who had been in
the cave with ki-gor stood guard around
helene similar squads had released
ngeeso and nanooko from the stakes

  ki-gor raised his hands over his head
and his allies prodded the beaten tatoga
into silence

  you have paid for your greed he
told them now each of you shall look
upon this rotten thing you called a god
and when you are finished this corpse
and the image of your false god momba-
ngar shall both be cast into the water
and be forgotten i give you into the care
of your true chieftain nanooko know-
ing he will exact proper punishment of
those who supported the legless mans evil
reign

  he waved to the guards around nanooko
and they cleared away for the old man so
he could reach ki-gor as nanooko
clasped his hand the nearly-nude figure of
a girl slipped out of the crowd and ran
towards them masai and pygmy warriors
moved to intercept her but ki-gor called
to them to let her pass

  she flung herself down before ki-gor
ringing his knees with her arms it was
sepah the legless man made me help
him she said weeping i was against
everything he did i meant to kill him
when i had the chance

  she flung her arms wide crawling back-
ward a few feet on her knees she had
used her beauty before on men

  protect me ki-gor and i will be your
slave she begged her sly eyes assessing
him there are some who will tell you
lies about me protect me and you will
never regret your generosity

  ki-gor studied her coldly it is na-
nookos generosity you must ask not
mine he said he will judge all wrong-
doers

  fear flicked in her eyes she looked
quickly towards the old chieftain nanooko
gave sepah no chance to speak

  you will be tied hand and foot against
the legless man nanooko grimly decreed
and cast with him into the water and if
you dare speak another lying word you
shameless wench ill have you flayed and
rubbed with salt before drowning you with
your lover

  oh no wailed sepah save me ki-
gor  dont let him kill me
slave of the jackal priestess



  the sentence was harsh but sepahs
crimes were many and great and in the
jungle the yardstick of justice is an eye
for an eye and a tooth for a tooth ki-
gor had given all judgment over to na-
nooko and it was not his place nor his
wish to interfere he walked past sepah
crossed the rock bridge to the clearing

  ngeeso ran to meet him clasped his
hand joyously

  if i myself buried you the pygmy
swore fervently never would i take an
oath that you were actually dead

  ki-gor grinned one owes you debts
it will take a lifetime to pay he said
acknowledging the loyalty ngeeso had
displayed

  bah snapped ngeeso suddenly em-
barrassed utter no more such talk

  then the white lord strode on to where

helene waited tembu george had just
freed her from the silver chains the
masai chieftain watched fondly as the
jungle couple embraced

  oh ki-gor murmured helene joy-
ously i never thought the time would be
again when i would feel your arms about
me she looked into his face and your
eyes are well again i know it by the way
you walk and act

  you should know it from the way i
look at you he told her softly

  helene let ki-gor kiss her then she
pulled away from him held up a warning
finger

  but let me tell you one thing ki-gor
she said emphatically ill go to war with
you any time you say but this is abso-
lutely the last time youll ever see me

two men followed that spoor of mood into the forbidden
veldt but only one was coming back only one could
escape the headless vultures of umzinto

the clock in the town of

laurenco marques was just strik-
ing midnight at the moment dan
turcan stepped from the gloom of the
arches flanking the avenida aquila and
hurried toward the plaza he gained the
shadow of the palmetto trees then came
to an abrupt halt looking keenly about him
someone had been shadowing him up from
the wharf but there was no sign of him
now reassured he made his way more
leisurely toward the governors residence
through th vasco da gama gardens

  the familiar odors of the jungle-the
pleasant ones were all around him the
heavy sweetness of orchids of the dusty
hibiscus and the sharper fragrance of the
red clover blossom below the town with
its flat-roofed white and pink-washed
houses the waters of the bay shone like
dull gold under the rusting muzzles of the
old forts cannon-guns that once had
bloomed portugals maritime supremacy in
the ears of the world and the claim to the
riches of the fever-sodden hinterland be-
yond the town

  but times had changed portuguese
authority was weak even on the coast
cetshwayos impis were flashing along the
borders white renegades and black up-
starts clutched at rich territories laid waste
by massacre in the chancellories of europe
calculating eyes studied the map of africa
and in africa men slept with a hand on
their rifles da cunha governor of mozam-
bique watched uneasily the rapid growth
pf colonies and republics on his long vague
frontier

  it was like da cunha turcan thought
to call him to a secret conference at mid-
night everything he did he did secretly
it was not that he was unscrupulous he
had an hidalgos pride in blood and honor
it was just consciousness of his countrys
weakness that made him prefer intrigue


where an overt move would provoke a
powerful rival nor was he entirely wrong
in this case turcan conceded if there was
a treaty to be signed with a powerful chief
turcan the supposedly disinterested ameri-
can the poor white hunter could act for
his adopted country without causing so
much as the lifting of a political eyebrow
yes da cunha had his points and that he
paid well was not the least of them in tur-
cans opinion

  but it wasnt money that had brought
him to laurenco in answer to da cunhas
summons after two years of exile he
wanted to see ines da cunha again before
she married the noble de cabral it would
be opening an old wound he should have
ignored the summons stayed away but he
was a sucker for punishment and-

  turcan lifted his head a faint metallic
sound dissonant amid the pulsing rhythm
of insect throats had reached his ears he
walked on for a few strides then faced
about quickly

  the leaves of an ilex bush bordering on
the path rustled and quivered no white
man could have gone to cover so swiftly
and silently unless like turcan he had
spent half his life in the jungle the
shadows were an invisible cloak for a
black skin turcan was unarmed but he
advanced on the bush knowing that it was
safer to force the black to attack or run

  moonlight flashed on steel as he neared
the bush turcan dived at a pair of black
muscular legs and brought his assailant
crashing down on the stone path where he
lay with the breath knocked out of him

  turcan got to his feet picking up his
broad-brimmed hat and a short stabbing
assegai that had been aimed at his throat
he recognized makuas workmanship and
looked down on the warrior his mind prob-
ing for a motive for the attack

  his steamer had anchored in the bay at
de cabral came at him with the club kicking and flailing




jungle stories

noon but da cunha had asked for secrecy
and he had remained aboard until a little
before midnight only someone close to da
cuhna could have known of his arrival

  the makua warrior was getting to his
feet muscles rippled under his oiled skin
and the moonlight glinted on his metal head
ring and bangles turcans face was in the
shadow of his hat

  are you ready to die o slayer by
stealth he asked in the makua tongue

  the warrior faced him without flinching
i have no weapon otherwise you would
die white man he boasted

  turcan snapped the shaft of the assegai
across his knee and flung the pieces from
him what now warrior  he challenged

the makua sprang at him turcan met
his rush with his shoulder his arms
twined around the others waist like flexi-
ble bands of steel the makua gasped and
clawed at turcans face as he felt his ribs
bend in the next moment he was lifted
and thrown into a flower bed

  he got to his feet slowly and stood with
folded arms turcan had lost his hat in
the brief encounter and the warriors im-
passive gaze dwelt on his blond curls

  it is enough i know you now lord
said he

  turcans eyes searched the others face
so you did not know me but yet you
stalked me as the hunter stalks his quarry
how is that liar

  it is true lord your back was shown
to me and i followed as i was told to do
but perchance i would not have done so if
i had known that it was you whose deeds
are praised throughout the jungle

  who thirsts for my blood demanded
turcan

  his name may not be spoken lord
and turcan knew that neither threat nor
torture would drag it from the grim-faced
warrior

  this you may answer with honor war-
rior said he is his skin white or black

  the makuas teeth showed in a grin
he is neither white nor black and do
not try to smell him out lord for if your
paths should cross you would surely die

  a half-caste turcan knew that he had
dangerous enemies among the few who
knew or guessed that he was da cunhas
agent but none he could think of that would

answer the makuas enigma and the war-
riors set features told him that further
questioning would be met with stubborn
silence

  return to your master said he say
to him that i pluck out evil at the roots i
will smell him out i punish the master not
the slave go and be witness to my words
at the residencia turcan was conducted
down a long hall to da cunhas study the
bare flat feet of his white-coated swahili
guide padded over the polished floor of
yellow wood turcans footsteps echoed
hollowly behind him he heard voices as
the house-boy opened a door to announce
him

  two men rose as he entered da cunha
was adjusting his blue tunic which was
liberally laced with gold it fitted his plump
figure tightly and his fingers fumbled with
the buttons the other man was as tall as
turcan and dressed in immaculate white
his black hair curled crisply his lower
lip showed full and red above his pointed
beard it was a handsome face but for the
eyes which though large and widely spaced
had a cold tawny glint in them an aloof-
ness that robbed the regular features of
their charm

  da citnha came from behind his desk
and extended his hand to turcan with an
affable smile senhor said he i feared
that you would not come when i sent you
away you were angry and your anger is
a thing to remember perhaps you see now
that it was for your own good as well as
that of my niece senhorita da cunha
some things are seen better at a dis-
tance excellency

  i agree if you include my niece among
those things

  turcans eyes flashed excellency i say
again that i made no advances towards
your niece

  da cunha waved his hand no no we
will not start again he settled himself
behind his desk you know the senhor
de costa cabral he went on and since
this is as much his business as mine he
will remain with us

  as turcans gaze came to rest on de
cabral there was a noticeable stiffening in
the poise of both men

  lopes bermudo de costa cabral was
gall and wormwood for turcan it was not
wholly because de cabral was to marry
slayer by stealth



ines da cunha de cabral lived by the
prazzo system-a system by which the dis-
tricts or prazzos were auctioned off to the
highest bidder the right to levy taxes going
with them de cabral had an oriental con-
ception of squeeze and he sucked money
from his prazzos as a leech sucks blood
turcan hated the vicious system the other
stood for and he wore his colors on his
sleeve

  i regret it excellency said he but
ill have no part of anything de cabrals
mixed up in

  de cabrals eyes burned but his lips
smiled your excellency would do well to
acquaint senhor turcan with the nature
of our mission his white teeth showed in
an insinuating smile as he turned to tur-
can you forget senhor that we have one
thing in common

  da cunha loked from one to the other
so said he very well i shall be brief
senhor turcan my niece has been ab-
ducted  she has vanished like-like a puff
of smoke the holy saints know how and
where

ines da cunha-turcans cheeks
burned as the significance of de cabrals
words rubbed salt into his still raw memory
of the girl as he saw her now she was
a coquette with seductive lines and dazzling
eyes she had accompanied her uncle on
safaris that turcan had organized and led
no man with red blood in his veins could
share the easy companionship of the camjj
with her and come out unscathed turcan
had not but the bluest blood of portugal
flowed in her veins and he had kept his
feelings to himself or fancied he had
nursing his pride in silence

  feeling the mockery in de cabrals eyes
he stifled the exclamation that had come to
his lips when he spoke it was with studied
calm

  my condolences excellency when did
it happen 

  da cunha wiped sweat from his bald
head 

  the devil you take it coolly two
months ago senhor

two months turcan was incredulous
yes senhor i have sent troops to search
what good is a regiment-an army in this
stinking wilderness  moreover i have had
to recall my soldiers-the moment of

troops is apt to be misunderstood in these
times senhor de cabral has just returned
from a long unsuccessful search i am at
my wits end you know the country and
the tribes as few men do i ask you to serve
me again senhor do you accept

  of course excellency but let us start
at the beginning

  good my niece vanished on the eve of
her nuptials she was to have married de
cabral on the following day and-

  one moment excellency turcan in-
terposed with a gleam in his eye de cabral
was da cunhas choice not the girls she
was high-spirited and if she had made up
her mind to defy her uncle-what makes
you sure that the senhorita was abducted
excellency 

  the devil what else da cunha
spread his hands

  turcan smiled is it not conceivable
that a woman as used to the jungle as the
senhorita is might prefer its dangers to
marriage with de cabral 

  holy mother- de cabrals anger
choked him as he sprang to his feet tur-
can was up in the same instant

  but da cunha brought his fist down on
his desk with a crash

  senhors you forget my presence
then as the two young men returned to
their seats and sat glaring at each other he
went on

  senhor turcan you will guard your
tongue because de cabral has my com-
mission in his pocket he will accompany
you on this safari

  the devil you say turcan gasped
the devil does not say it senhor i
dom pedro da cunha governor of mo-
zambique say it i am not concerned with
your rivalry if you are true gentlemen
you will set it aside until my niece is found
he rose adjusting his tight tunic with a
decisive jerk

  now senhors i shall leave you to dis-
cuss your plans and by the holy saints if
i hear any more of your quarreling ill
clap you both in irons

  after da cunha had left them there was
a long silence turcan was the first to
speak

  i ran into a little trouble in the gar-
dens on my way here said he a makua
with a sticker was he a pal of yours 

  a pal of mine a makua what the


jungle stories

devil- de cabrals surprise was genuine

  never mind said turcan he consid-
ered the other with a puzzled expression in
his eyes

  you know that i hate your guts but
you want to go on safari with me where
youll have to sweat eat and sleep with me
why

  de cabral brought the tips of his white
fingers together and eyed turcan solemnly
said he

  when i learned that his excellency had
sent for you it occurred to me that women
are emotional creatures apt to be swept
off their feet by the enthusiasm of the
moment-by such a sentiment as gratitude
for instance and that this was as true of
senhorita da cunha as it was of the others
do you agree senhor

  your experience makes me the pupil
go on

  well i think you are a very competent
fellow if ines da cunha is alive you will
find her and now i ask you frankly is
that fair competition senhor

  turcan laughed i see what youre
driving at you think ill find the girl and
out of gratitude shell throw herself in
my arms not ines da cunha

  nevertheless i do not feel that i can
take the risk now i propose that we make
a truce until the senhorita is found after
that may the better man win you ameri-
cans boast of your sportsmanship is mine
not a sporting proposition senhor

  it sounds like one de cabral turcan
rubbed his chin thoughtfully the way
the old man has things fixed we havent
much choice well if youre still of the
same mind tomorrow all right well go
up river as far as the carmelite mission
at umzinto well organize the safari
there if necessary

  if necessary de cabrals eyebrows
arched

  turcan grinned i still think the sen-
horita ran out on you de cabral if she
did my guess is that shed go to umzinto
and ask for the protection of the good friars
until the old man cooled off if it wasnt
for vanity you might have thought of
that

  de cabrals tawny eyes glowed the
knuckles of his clenched hands showed
white

  your tongue has a sting in it turcan

when our truce is over it will be a pleas-
ure to extract it

  whenever you feel disposed to try
senhor said turcan

fifty miles above laurenco marques
the course of the komati was blocked
by an incomprehensible accumulation of
black boulders like the moraine of a gla-
cier turcan paid off his swahili boatmen
after unloading their kit on the left bank

  the mission a station of carmelite
friars lay a dozen miles up-stream beside
a deep pool shaded by monstrous spread-
ing cotton-silk trees there were traces
of a trail following the rivers bank up to
the mission but the good friars had waged
a losing battle against the prolific jungle
growth and native indolence turcan and
de cabral were forced to hack their way
slowly forward

  toward evening they came out into a
clearing columns of smoke curled sky-
ward above the cotton trees turcan walk-
ing at some distance ahead of de cabral
was the first to catch sight of it he stopped
in his tracks looking at the smoke for a
moment then he unslung his rifle the
bolt rattled ominously as he slipped a car-
tridge into its breach

  de cabral came to him and touched his
arm what is it senhor the smoke
turcans eyes were sweeping the clear-
ing that and the damned quiet he re-
plied its about sunset shouldnt the
mission bells be ringing for vespers de
cabral

  the devil-that is true de cabral
looked up at the smoke with his mouth
open what does it mean

  it could mean that the impi has passed
this way turcan answered ammuni-
tion handy de cabral he asked with
a look at the others face there might
be a few of em still skulking around

  de cabral loosened his colt in its hol-
ster and unslung his rifle ready sen-
hor said he and led the way toward the
hill under which the mission stood

  the silence of death was upon umzinto
the kraal of achievement so-called by
the makua because of the sweat and blood
it had cost them to erect its stone walls-
stone imported from a sanctuary in por-
slayer by stealth



tugal and carried block by block through
the jungle fire had destroyed the roof
of the main building its walls were a
blackened ruin the huts that had formed
a square facing onto the pool where the
lily and feathery papyrus had grown were
ashes the giant trunks of the cotton trees
were still smouldering the stench of de-
cay was in the fitful shifting wind vul-
tures rose in flight as the two white men
approached and perched like medieval gar-
goyles in the bare charred branches of the
trees the hyena and jackal fled to cover

  the two white men surveyed the deso-
lation their eyes cold their lips bloodless

  de cabral was the first to speak moth-
er of- he swore could she be among

that carrion

  turcan winced for him a man was a
man alive or dead black or white it
flashed through his mind that ines de
cunha would not be carrion-no the fact
that lopes le costa cabral loved her made
her more than mortal flesh his eyes
flashed with anger then a vision of ines
da cunha as he had last seen her smiling
vividly alive rose before his eyes his
throat tightened and he swallowed hard

  well make a search said he

  the two separated de cabral moving off
toward the rear of the ruined main build-
ing turcan toward the front picking his
way slowly along the path to the pool as
he went his eyes explored the debris he
saw no discarded weapons the people of
the mission had little warning the dead
lay close to where the doors of their huts
had been as if struck down as they rushed
out at the first alarm he paused looking
down upon the body of a dead makua
apparently the only loss suffered by the
raiding impi the warrior had died of
strangulation strong hands has throttled
the life out of him turcan thought of
father furtado the powerful chaplain of
the station his eyes scanned the ground

a trail like that made by a body
dragged over the ground led them
toward the pool a white-robed figure lay
face down among the reeds at the margin
of the pond its lower half submerged in
the water turcan dropped on his knees
beside the body blood had soaked through
the white habit it was still wet gently

-jungle stories-spring

turcan turned the body over as he did
so the monk groaned in the mud-caked
features turcan recognized father fur-
tado the monks eyes opened and fixed
on turcans face in a glassy stare

  it is i turcan father he pillowed
the dying mans head on his knee

  a wan smile came to the monks cracked
lips his big hand closed on turcans he
breathed deeply marshalling his remain-
ing strength his lips moved turcan bent
his head to catch the words

  they came and were gone like a tem-
pest my son killing-killing-

  there is one yonder who will slay no
more father said turcan

  the monk shut his eyes god forgive
me but when i saw him lay hands on

her-

  he coughed hollowly

  the senorita da cunha  prompted
turcan

  the monk nodded she came for pro-
tection from an unholy marriage she

feared-

  she is not dead father turcan was
urgent he knew the monk was near his
end

  they carried her off-many of the able-
bodied men and women-into bondage
the half-caste bosigos impi from the

prazzo angoche-

  the grip on turcans hand tightened
bloodless lips moved in silent prayer tur-
can stayed till the life left the monks great
body in a gasping sigh

  when turcan got to his feet he saw
de cabral making his way toward him he
went to meet the other with cold eyes and
tight lips

  did you discover anything de cabral
asked

  i did said turcan with his eyes fixed
on the others face i learned that the
impi was spewed out of angoche one of
your prazzos de cabral

  the portuguese leaned his weight on his
rifle studying turcans face so he
said at length i gather that you hold me
responsible for it

  impis were raiding before your time
and mine de cabral but if i was the law
id hang you for it nevertheless if youd
left them enough to live on they might
not have gone berserk

  de cabral smiled coldly let us leave


jungle stories

it at that senhor what of the senhorita
de cunha

  the good father said she was taken by
the impi along with the able-bodied men
and women

  then we follow the impi said de
cabral

  turcan smiled no amount of money
would persuade the tribesmen hereabouts
to follow it besides have you thought
what they would do to the tax collector of
angoche if they got their hands on him
de cabral laughed are you trying to
frighten me turcan appearances have
misled you i cant be got rid of so easily
i have his excellencys commission to act
for him we will send the first nigger we
come across back to laurenco marques
with news of the raid to do otherwise
would be to lose precious time if we cant
get porters we follow the impi alone
turcan smiled inwardly he wondered
how long the portuguese dandy would
stand up to the fast gruelling trek that
was ahead of them yet he recognized de
cabrals logic moreover he saw that he
needed de cabral since the raid had cut
him off from the supplies he had hoped
to obtain at umzinto he was another
rifle another back to carry a load at least
for a time de cabral had shown no weak-
ness so far he-turcan glanced at his
companion sharply de cabrals eyes were
intent on his face and he felt uncomfort-
able as if his thoughts had been read

  all right said he and turning on his
heel led the way back up the hill

  they made camp in a glade on the other
side of the kopj as darkness came the vul-
tures hyenas-the whole scavenger pack
of the jungle fought over their obscene
feast over the red embers of their fire
turcan talked more to shut his ears to
the bedlam on the other side of the hill
than for the want of companionship

  as i told you he was saying i was
attacked by a makua at laurenco he said
he was hired by a man whose skin was
neither black nor white now father fur-
tado spoke of a half-caste called bosi-
go-

  holy saints de cabral slapped his
thigh a half-caste-bosigo

  turcans eyes narrowed dyou happen
to know the man senhor

  de cabral looked surprised no he

shrugged but i see a connection between
your attacker and bosigo but go on sen-
hor what other conclusion have you
drawn for instance where is the impi
heading

  turcans lips twitched de cabral would
have to do better than that if he wanted
him to believe that he had never heard of
bosigo before

  my guess is that the impi will trek
north and west bosigo is doing a little
slaving on his way hell raid more kraals
that will make his spoor easy to follow
and it will delay him we may catch up
with him within three or four days after
that-well well cross the bridge when we
come to it

  hm-m de cabral mused i am in-
clined to agree but for one thing what
would rouse the government more than
this attack upon umzinto it is a small
station he could not have hoped for many
captives it makes him a fool senhor
turcan shook his head not if he knew
ines da cunha was there his excellency
was ready to negotiate before he knew his
enemy ines da cunha is his safe conduct
to wherever hes going shes as good as
a grant to settle wherever he pleases in
mozambique

  de cabral was gazing into the fire a
frown between his eyes

  yes he said slowly it does fit to-
gether he sent one of his makuas to at-
tack you because he knew your reputation
and was afraid he spread his hands
but how could he know of your coming
turcan shrugged a house-boy at the
residency maybe they get to know more
than most whites suspect

  de cabrals smile was sardonic it is
gratifying to know that you do not lay the
fault at my feet senhor

  im giving you doubtful benefit tur-
can retorted if youd known ines da
cunha was here youd have dragged her
back to the altar with or without her con-
sent

  de cabral laughed softly by the
saints you are right that i would have
done and that i intend to do senhor tur-
can

  not if she doesnt want you said
turcan

  de cabral unrolled his blankets and
yawned that said he is another
slayer by stealth



bridge that we will cross when we come
to it

they made an early start on the fol-
lowing day turcan planned to follow
the impambanyoni the stream joined with
the komati several miles below komati
poort a narrow pass through the moun-
tains into the transvaal above the fly and
swamp country native kraals were more
numerous and since the population was
correspondingly denser it was the logical
route for bosigo and his slave column to
follow moreover in the transvaal there
was a ready market for slaves or appren-
tices as the boers called them

  they passed through the ruins of um-
zinto the vultures were still fighting over
the bodies of the slain de cabral was in
the lead turcan saw him stop suddenly
de cabrals colt flashed from its holster
as turcan ran up to him he fired twice

  ugly- said he he gave turcan a
queer smile that makes two less of them
senhor he added and walked on

  turcan looked toward the spot from
which the birds had risen in flight measur-
ing the distance with his eye it was all
of twenty paces curious he walked over
to the spot and looked down on two head-
less vultures there was a grim smile on
his lips when he turned to follow de cabral
the portuguese talked and dressed like a
dandy but there was nothing effeminate in
the way he handled his weapons nor did
he turcan felt sure do anything without
some dark purpose behind it his demon-
stration of markmanship was more than
mere braggadocio it was a covert warn-
ing-his way of saying that two were go-
ing into the jungle but only one was going
to come out

  the first village they came to-a small
one-was deserted its inhabitants had ob-
viously fled into the bush for turcan it
meant that they were on the right track
evidently the villagers had been warned
of bosigos approach and had scattered
the two white men searched the half
dozen huts for food turcan was careful
to leave payment in coin for what was
taken on the hearth of the head mans hut
then they began their march again fol-
lowing a westerly bend of the river

  a dense cloud of smoke shot through
with flames rolling up out of the forest

warned them that they were close upon
the heels of the impi it was the third day
of the trek and they had climbed to an
eminence commanding a view of the val-
ley of the impambanyoni where it made
a sweeping bend southward they looked
down upon the roof of the jungle sloping
away to the east like a patchwork carpet
the burning kraal lay on the near side
of the bend about five miles distant for
a moment the two men watched the smoke
in silence each busy with his own thoughts
de cabral broke the silence

  soon we must cross the bridge you
spoke of senhor said he

  turcan nodded assent it looks like
a fair-sized kraal they could muster three
or four hundred warriors that means
bosigos in strength

  true or he would not have attacked
de cabral agreed and now we approach
the end of our trek i wonder what two
men can do against an impi

  turcan smiled its too late to think
of that said he we wont do anything
the impi knows about thats sure

  de cabral looked at him curiously you
have a plan senhor

  turcan shook his head well go down
to the kraal if theres anyone alive we
may learn something

ill

the village had been a strong one it
had occupied both banks of the river
fire had destroyed the half on the north-
ern bank of the river the other half still
stood on the opposite bank upon a huge
flat outcrop of rock the river bursting
full-born from its womb in the longwe
mountains swept around it and leaped over
the red rock in a crystal stream the bould-
ers that barred its impetuous dash to the
sea had been fretted into weird shapes
and formed a natural ford of stepping
stones

  a six-foot stockade of thorn bush woven
between pointed stakes had encircled the
village with the river flowing between the
fire had burned down to the edge of the
water and had leaped across but only that
part near the banks had been destroyed in
places it looked as if it had been hacked
down to prevent the spread of flames most
of the huts were still intact


jungle stories

  everywhere on the one side of the
stream was the debris of battle a warriors
plume trampled in the dust painted shields
and assegais lay where they had fallen
from the stricken warriors hands but
there was not a body to be seen this
puzzled turcan until his eye was caught
by a white ostrich plume bobbing among
the rocks in the river a closer look showed
the body of a makua warrior wedged be-
tween th rocks the story was not hard
to read bosigo had stormed the north
side of the village the villagers had re-
treated to the south side bosigo had at-
tempted to pursue them but had met with
a decisive check at the river bosigo would
not have stopped to fling the bodies into
the river the villagers had done that for
the same reason that they had stamped out
the fire they meant to return they were
still a tribe-a fighting unit

      if to confirm his deductions a tom-
tom throbbed suddenly turcan listened
striving to localize the sound he placed
it about two miles up-stream on the south
bank he turned to de cabral

  these fellows have given bosigo a bad
mauling and theyre not through with him
yet maybe weve found the bridge were
looking for

  de cabrals eyebrows arched is read-
ing the drums one of your accomplish-
ments senhor

  turcan ignored his sarcasm bosigo is
still on this side of the river the villagers
are on the other im going to cross over
and see what theyre up to

  they crossed the river jumping from
stone to stone a shaded path led along
the bank between gigantic cotton woods
and fragrant bedamier trees with mango-
like flowers there was a wild beauty about
the place turcan had visited the kraal
once before years ago as they pushed
their way forward he strove to recall its
name it did not occur to him until they
came to a streamlet that fed a deep pool
of clear water the water-lily and lotus
floated upon its surface and around its
margin among the reeds huge balls of
amber and orange-colored blossoms scented
the air then turcan remembered aman-
zimtoti the place of sweet waters

  a little way beyond the pool the beat
of tom-toms burst upon them and pres-
ently the wild refrain of a war chant night

had come swiftly through the thinning
trees they saw flashes of fire-light and
black laping figures there was raw naked
beauty in the scene a joyous play of mus-
cles a frenzy of savage exaltation the
two white men watched the dancers from
behind a clump of bush then turcan led
the way into the clearing

  no one noticed their approach until they
came within the circle of fire-light a
woman pointed and screamed silence fol-
lowed the circle of dancers opened be-
fore them on the far side of the ring a
tall figure rose from among a group of
white-plumed indunas he came toward
them with lithe swinging stride his white
plumes tossing and the tails of his leopard
skin whipping about his muscular legs he
was young in the first years of his man-
hood he stood before the two white men
eyeing each of them closely his gaze came
to rest on turcan he raised his assegai
i know you said he

turcan studied the young chiefs face
weaving the threads of memory i
know you chief said he at last but when
i knew you before your father wore the
leopard-skin and the weapons you carried
were toys

  it is so lord his eyes flashed proudly
but now i wear his kroos i hold his
weapons it was not childs play at the
river yesterday

  my eyes saw that umbesi

  umbesis teeth showed in a wide grin
oh you have not forgotten us lord
said he

  are true men as the red berries on the
vine that they should be forgotten chief 
umbesis grin broadened it is true
that they are not said he

  you did mens work at the ford um-
besi

  the youngster needed no more prompt-
ing he struck a savage blow at an imag-
inary foe many died at the river he
boasted we drove them back like cattle
they did not know us his voice rose
they did not know that we the zamaro
are the spawn of chaka the elephant
the-

  spears flashed in the moonlight young
warriors pressed about their chief their
applause a long-drawn aie-e-e drowned
his voice
slayer by stealth



  umbesi swaggered we drove them
back he shouted they are hyenas they
skulk in the bush across the river--
and what does umbesi do turcan
stemmed the torrent

  he follows the hyena to see that he
does not cross to his side of the river lord
turcans smile was disparaging is that
enough o spawn of chaka

  umbesi scowled he looked crest-fallen
what more could be done

  turcan moved close to him so that no
other ears might catch his words said he
softly i too am at war with bosigo he
has slain government people show me his
camp and i will show you how to put your
name in every mans mouth

  umbesi blinked at him owlishly he bel-
lowed a command the tom-toms began
their rhythmic beating dust rose beneath
stamping feet

  de cabral caught turcans sleeve as he
turned to follow umbesi what is all
this palaver he wanted to know nigger
gibberish has no meaning for me he
made it sound as if understanding was
degrading

  turcan shook his arm free go find a
place to sleep said he youll know soon
enough

  umbesi led turcan to the bank of the
river at a point several hundred yards
up-stream he pointed across the swift
water no more than a hundred yards sepa-
rated them from bosigos outposts the
light of watch fires flickered among the
trees but it was a mile down stream that
turcan found what he was looking for-
the slave train and the cattle evidently
they were camped deeper in the jungle at
some distance from the rivers bank no
fires were visible

  above the lowing of the cattle he heard
snatches of a song sung in chorus-a plain-
tive air in which he thought he recognized
the twenty-third psalm the singers would
be the natives captured at umzinto was
ines da cunha among them or a mile
up-stream with the impi  perhaps no more
than a few hundred yards separated him
from the girl who during the long trek
through the jungle had come to sweeten
the day-dreams from which he had sought
to banish her

  turcans eyes swept over the swift river
he thought of swimming it to reconnoitre

the camp but he could think of no dis-
guise that could make an african out of
a white man discovery would be certain
after a while he beckoned umbesi to him
as the young chief squatted beside him he
said

  there are many cattle yonder umbesi
it is a pity that they should fill the bellies
of bosigos warriors he will grow strong
on the meat

  umbesi grunted some of our cattle
are among the herd lord

  if i were with bosigo yonder turcan
continued and you were with the cattle
umbesi could i see you

  umbesi laughed no lord a man could
not see so far through the trees

  true umbesi and it is also true that
if twenty warriors swam the river they
could drive the cattle back to the ford and
bosigo would not see it

  the young chief sprang to his feet we
would be swift and silent he could not
hear us

  turcan smiled we will make sure that
he does not you will gather your people
an induna will lead them up-stream bos-
igo will see them he will follow them to
learn the meaning of it he will send a
runner back to the herdsmen to tell them
to break camp and follow him but we will
be between bosigo and the herd we will
catch the runner the herdsmen will not
know that bosigo is marching and when
the gap between them and bosigo is wide
we will strike is it good umbesi

  oh it is good-good umbesi stamped
the ground in his excitement the indunas
will not whisper among themselves saying
that i am too young for the leopard-skin
turcan patted his shoulder go show
them your wisdom he urged and when
the council is over come to me

  i go lord

  turcan made his way back to the clear-
ing he found de cabral snoring beside
one of the fires in spite of the uproar
swirling about him he shook the portu-
guese awake

  de cabral listened bleary-eyed while
turcan outlined the plan of attack when
turcan had finished he sat scowling into
the fire evidently turning the plan over in
his mind turcan was not surprised when
he said

  i do not approve of your plan senhor


jungle stories

  show me a better challenged turcan
de cabral stroked his beard how far
are we from ressano gareia senhor
thirty or forty miles south-east

  de cabral nodded so i thought i
have his excellencys commission we will
use it you will go to gareia and return
with soldiers

  turcans eyes widened im damned if
that doesnt sound like an order said he
it is precisely that senhor

turcan threw his head back and
laughed oh the devil you say
look de cabral innes da cunha wouldnt
live five minutes after bosigo saw the first
soldier shes his safe conduct his pro-
tection against the very thing you suggest
i thought you understood that

  de cabral squinted at him that is your
theory but you speak of theory as if it
were fact you are so damned cock-sure
perhaps your enthusiasm for the heroic
role you have cast for yourself blinds you
to who is in authority here

  turcans smile was provocative i
hadnt thought of that said he but now
i wonder if its your idea to send me to
gareia and act out the part yourself

  de cabral got to his feet with an oath
he tapped his breast pocket must i re-
mind you of his excellencys commission 
both you and his excellency can go
plumb to hell im crossing the river before
morning

  de cabrals eyes narrowed his colt
flashed from its holster

  no senhor the softness of his voice
heightened the menace in it you have
been insubordinate you have outlived
your usefulness

  he broke off with a start umbesi re-
turning from the council had crept up be-
hind him the broad blade of his assegai
pricked de cabrals spine

  what is your will lord  he asked over
de cabrals shoulder

  drop your gun de cabral said tur-
can

  de cabrals eyes blazed he bit his lips
until the blood came umbesis blade bored
into his flesh the gun dropped from his
hand turcan kicked it from him he
smiled but his grey eyes were cold

  now senhor said he you were
saying 

  de cabral folded his arms no said
he men of my blood do not settle their
differences by beating each other with their
fists we prefer cold steel

  theres a good deal of that around
observed turcan and smiled as he saw the
others color change but ive no desire
to kill you i would rather have had you
come with me tonight but now youll un-
derstand i couldnt risk showing you my
back youll leave your weapons here and
stay on this side of the river under guard
if things go wrong ill answer for it

  de cabrals face twisted into a grimace
of hate my time will come turcan holy

saints i swear i- he choked with

impotent rage as umbesis spear urged him
away

  by midnight umbesis people were wind-
ing out along the rivers bank turcan had
asked for noise and umbesi had taken him
literally the line of march was a tumult
tom-toms throbbed the voices of women
and children shrilled above the bass of the
warriors chant and as distance stretched
the disorderly mass the wild song lost its
rhythm and broke up into toneless uproar

iv

half a mile up-stream turcan um-
besi and twenty young zamaros halt-
ed at a bend in the river where the current
was not so swift as the uproar of the
marchers faded turcan led his little band
down to the river one warrior was posted
as a guard turcan left his rifle and ammu-
nition in his care then he stripped and
waded out into the cold stream umbesi
and his warriors followed him one by one

  swimming on his back with his clothes
and a colt held over his head made the
going hard for turcan the current bore
him down stream and he gained the oppo-
site bank far below his starting point a
halo of mist ringed a pale disc of a moon
turcan shivered as he dressed a damp
fog was settling over the river he could
see only a few feet along the bank the
hoot of an owl told him that umbesi had
landed above him he picked his way for-
ward in the direction of the sound war-
riors appeared out of the surrounding
gloom soon all were gathered about their
chief and turcan

as had been arranged umbesi and three
slayer by stealth



warriors went upstream to intercept bos-
igos runner the remainder grouped them-
selves about turcan shivering in the chill
night air he directed them to start a fire
in a hollow in the rivers bank he knew
their fear of the jungle at night and he
turned their minds from it with tales of
hunting and war while they talked he was
able to snatch an hours sleep

  umbesi and his companions returned an
hour before dawn

  it is done lord said the young chief
bosigo marches up river as you said he
would

  good said turcan bring the run-
ner i will talk with him

  umbesi and the warriors looked at each
other

  aie said umbesi only the witch
men can talk with him now lord

  turcan shook his head reprovingly it
was stupid to spear him umbesi how
will you learn your enemys strength if you
silence the tongue that would tell you
umbesi hung his head and stood silent
go now said turcan make your
men ready see to it that they are silent
when we come to the slave camp or i too
will think that you are too young to wear
the leopard-skin

  the light was better in the morning the
mist which had overcast the sky turned into
a nimbus of clouds umbesi led the way
back along the trail broken by bosigos
impi his zamaros dogged his heels glid-
ing swiftly between the gnarled mopani
and spiked clumpjies the lowing of cattle
and the thin spirals of smoke from dying
fires warned of their near approach to the
herd

  looking down on the kraal turcan
thought that there was a look of perma-
nence about it the herdsmens hut which
stood in the centre was well built and he
could see that the ground had been staked
for more huts but he counted only twelve
makua squatting about the fires against
the bush wall on the far side thirty or more
blacks men and women lay huddled to-
gether in sleep the women were fully clad
a sure sign of missionary influence and
turcan had no doubt that they were the
singers he had heard the night before was
ines da cunha among them turcans
pulse quickened if his luck was still with
him hed have her safe on the other side

of the river in less than two hours then
the military could deal with bosigo and his
impi

  the zamaros crouched behind clumps
of thorn bush were showing signs of rest-
lessness the muscles under their velvet
skin tensed and their grim faces set into
fierce lines as turcan drew his colt and
spun its cylinder

  he led them forward bent double dodg-
ing from bush to bush until the kraals wall
was between them and the dozing makua
he waited until umbesi had marshalled
them into a compact group then nodded
to the young chief

  umbesi led the dash across the gap that
separated them from the thorny gate of the
kraal their battle-cry bu-la-la bu-la-
la shattered the silence as they burst in
and rushed upon the amazed herdsmen

  several of the makua with the wits
scared out of them broke and ran for the
opposite gate with a dozen zamaros yell-
ing at their heels

  turcan saw two makua go down under
umbesis flashing spear the others flung
down their weapons and waited passively
for the death stroke

  let them live turcans voice rang out
over the yells of the victors

  umbesi looked shocked he stared at
turcan with his assegai poised

  where is your wisdom boy asked
turcan he pointed to the makuas there
are hands to weed your meale patch spears
to defend you if you treat them well
umbesi lowered his spear makua
dogs stir up the fires prepare food he
ordered

  turcan smiled umbesi was a good type
he thought he walked over to the group
on the far side of the kraal the hope of
finding ines da cunha died still-born as
turcans gaze swept over the full-bosomed
native women he singled out one he had
seen at the mission

  mary agu said he i seek the sen-
horita cunha

the negress shook her head she is
not here senhor we have not seen
her since we were taken from umzinto i
think she is with bosigo may the devils of
hell roast his yellow skin what will be
done with us now senhor

  the zamaros are your friends they


jungle stories

will guide you to ressano gareia make
ready to leave

  he turned away abruptly as the group
fervently began to call down blessings on
his head he walked toward the central
hut with his head bent the gall of disap-
pointment ran through his veins like a
numbing drug he felt suddenly over-
whelmingly tired

  turcan looked up as umbesi came run-
ning towards him a runner has come
from my people panted umbesi

  what does he say umbesi

  the white lord whom they guarded
has gone

  gone where demanded turcan
he broke from his guard and swam
the river lord

  turcans lethargy dropped from him like
a cloak it flashed across his mind instant-
ly that de cabral would not cross the river
to reach ressano gareia he had gone over
to bosigo he had meant to do so from
the beginning there was some connection
between the two turcan knew that de
cabral would do anything for money and
power he was convinced that the sneering
young nobleman had sold himself over to
bosigo turcan caught umbesis arm in a
hard grip

  the white lord has betrayed us
umbesi bosigo will turn back we will
be but twenty against him see now the
women cannot swim the river we must go
back to the ford at amanzimtoti call your
warriors quickly umbesi quickly

  but the cattle lord

  leave them umbesi if we are not
across the river soon we will all be food for
the hyenas

  despite turcans driving an hour was
lost before he got the zamaros on the
march bosigo he reasoned would not send
the whole of his impi in pursuit fifty pick-
ed warriors perhaps it was all a ques-
tion of time and the time it had taken de
cabral to get to bosigo was an indeter-
minable factor moreover he had only a
rough idea of the distance to the ford

  as the sun climbed over the trees tur-
can scanned the trail with anxious eyes
the river seemed to wind interminably
whenever he asked umbesi how far they
had still to go the answer was the same
not far now lord

  but a little before noon as they rounded

a sharp bend he recognized the clearing
where umbesi had camped looking down
stream he saw the first of the women
making her way cautiously across the
causeway of stones

  it was slow work some of the women
balked at the crossing and had to be carried
over the slippery stones there was a dip
in the trail near the bend formed by a
shoulder of rock turcan walked toward it
as he reached the top he saw whit plumes
tossing above the scrub in a moment the
first of the makuas came into full view
swinging around the bend with a swift
running gait turcan dashed back to the
ford the last of the mission people were
crossing over he fired a shot from his
colt to draw umbesis attention

  swim umbesi he yelled at the top
of his voice swim for it

  he saw the zamaros dash for the river
and plunge in the first makua came over
the ridge and catching sight of turcan
charged down with a wild yell he pitched
forward as turcan began to shoot his
fall did not check the others they swept
down on turcan like a wave he emptied
his gun into them then ran for the river
an assegai whizzed past his ear a knob-
kerry thudded at the nape of his neck a
torrent roared in turcans ears and swept
him into oblivion

  when turcan first became conscious he
noted the fetid stench of putrid flesh and
the itching sting of vermin he lay bound
hand and foot upon the hide of an animal
not long dead nothing was visible in the
blackness but as he writhed convulsively
he caught a glimpse of moonlight against
its pale radiance he traced the vague out-
line of the curved roof above him

  for a time he lay still outside he could
hear the river tumbling over the rocks and
the murmur of many voices from their
number he judged he was in bosigos camp
he thought bitterly of de cabrals treach-
ery would he use da cunhas authority-
whitewash the blood spilled at umzinto and
sign a shameless treaty for the release of
ines da cunha

as the rays of the sun slanted over the
trees two stalwart makuas entered
his hut they dragged him out and slashed
his bonds they led him forward

  everywhere about him there was fev-
slayer by stealth



erish activity axes rang on timber
machetes slashed out in the bush a staked
wall of unusual strength and construction
was being built around the campsite it was
clear to turcan that bosigo contemplated
permanent settlement on the banks of the
impambanyoni bosigos house resembled
a european bungalow more than a native
hut it had windows cane doors and at
least three separate compartments tur-
can was led into the central room

  bosigo sat on a stool beside a crude
table a leopard skin was draped over his
powerful naked shoulders he wore hide
trousers and shoes his white skin showed
a yellowish tinge blotched with black and
behind his small black eyes lurked the
bitter hatred of the outcast turcans gaze
turned from him passed over de cabral
standing at the other end of the table and
came to rest on the lovely face of the girl
who stood by his side

  turcan saluted her after the portuguese
fashion with a stiff bow saying i had
hoped to meet you under happier circum-
stances senhorita

  except for the worn appearance of her
clothes ines da cunha looked none the
worse for her long trek from umzinto
she wore a bodice with puffed sleeves
trimmed with lace that had once been white
and a long full skirt with a waist-line that
turcan could span with his both hands she
courtesied to him as sedately as if she were
in the reception hall of the residencia

  you are not too late to be of service to
us if it pleases you senhor said she

v

her us sounded ominous in tur-
cans ear out of the corner of his
eye he saw the scowl on bosigos face he
had given the half-caste no more than a
casual glance and guessed that bosigo felt
that more was his due he would have gone
on talking if the half-caste had not inter-
rupted him

  senhor said bosigo in a booming
voice and in good portuguese you may
wonder why you are alive

it is something to wonder at answered
turcan with so many dead in your path
bosigo eyed him up and down ap-
praisingly so you are the great turcan
he said who plucks out evil at the roots

i am ashamed to think that once i feared
you

  it was not i you feared turcan re-
torted but the hangmans noose i might
string around your neck youve still got
reason to fear justice bosigo

  the half-castes laugh seemed to come
from the pit of his stomach i do not
fear the justice you speak of it is a thing
to be bought and sold already i have
reached an agreement with the senhor de
costa cabral who is his excellencys emis-
sary and from whom i have bought justice
before our agreement is set down on this
paper he handed a folded yellow sheet to
turcan

  do not scowl upon it senhor said he
as turcan began to read with a frown be-
tween his eyes you owe your life to it i
have let you live so that you might carry it
to the excellency and when he has signed
it return with it to me as you will see for
the release of ines da cunha i demand a
grant of land here and that i bosigo be
recognized as chief-paramount over the
tribes within its bounds

  for the release of the senhorita ines
  da cunha and her betrothed husband
  the senhor lopes bermudo de costa
  cabral  

  turcan read aloud he glanced up his
eyes intent upon the girls face is this
true senhorita

  her signature is affixed to the docu-
ment de cabral spoke for the first time
and the triumph in his eyes made turcans
spine bristle

  the senhorita can speak for herself
said turcan curtly

  that i am to marry the senhor de
cabral has been known to you for some
time senhor said she

  so it has said turcan but it is also
known that you fled to umzinto on the
eve of your marriage why he de-
manded

  ines da cunhas eye-brows arched
your question is indelicate senhor on
the eve of marriage a woman may feel the
need of spiritual guidance

  turcan smiled you must have been in
sore need of it to stay two months sen-
horita he commented dryly

  the girls eyes flashed to de cabrals face
and back to turcan there was something
tense and unnatural about her bearing


jungle stories

  is it your wish asked turcan that i
carry this paper to his excellency your
uncle

  the girl pouted her red lips it is my
wish to return to civilization she affirmed
the filth and dirt of savages sickens one
i cannot sleep for the fear of wild beasts
the senhor de cabral has had the wit to
arrange for my release if you senhor
have any feeling for my sex you will hurry
to my uncle and complete the good work
which the senhor de cabral because he is
held hostage cannot do for himself
turcan stared at the girl with a puzzled
expression he saw the face and form of
ines da cunha but it was as if he looked
upon another person when last he had
known her she had loved the freshness of
the open veldt and the mysterious gloom of
the great forest he had seen her join in
tribal ceremonies and nursenative children
to health bosigos voice recalled his
thoughts

  are you satisfied demanded the half-
caste

  turcan smiled thinly tha is not for
me to say his excellency will accept or
reject your terms as he sees fit

but you will take the treaty to him
turcan shrugged i was hired to find
his niece and to bring about her release it
is not the way i would have chosen
bosigo

  good bosigo grinned at him it
would have been different but for the
treachery of de cabral eh senhor but
what is done is done i will give you today
for rest tomorrow you leave do not
think of escape warriors will go with you
say to his excellency that i have spies
if he sends soldiers i shall know it almost
as soon as he gives the order and the
senhorita da cunha will die

  as turcan turned to leave he flashed a
quick look at the girls face but she had
turned to speak to de cabral her red lips
smiling his thoughts were profane as he
marched out into the sunlight between his
guards

in the pulsing softness of the jungle
night ines da cunha made her way
toward turcans hut she looked more like
a white savage than the first lady of
mozambique she had discarded the vol-
uminous dress and for still greater free-

dom of movement and silence she had
ripped the silken frills from her underskirt
and made a kilt of it she wore veldschorn
laced to her ankles her long hair was
braided and bound with a kerchief

  she made her way swiftly gliding from
shadow to shadow sometimes crawling
where the moonlight cut a swath of soft
light between the huts or silhouetted the
statusque form of a makua guard

  a guard had been placed over turcan
but his charge was deep in the sleep of
near-exhaustion with the natural slack-
ness of his kind he had wandered over to
a nearby fire drawn there by the savory
smell of roasting buck and the laughter of
his companions the girl slipped through
the huts small opening and groped her
way toward turcan guided by his deep
breathing

  turcan woke as cold steel touched his
bound wrist

  hurry senhor ines whispered in his
ear before the guard returns

  a throb of relief-of heartfelt joy made
turcans voice husky he caught her hand
in the darkness if i doubted you for a
while-

  the girls fingers touched his lips lightly
i take pride in my skill as an actress
senhor but i think lopes must be sus-
picious then she explained how she had
permitted herself to become engaged to
de cabral in order to provoke turcan into
proving to her uncle his real superiority
as a man

  turcan felt the convulsive quiver of her
shoulders after a pause he said de
cabrals no fool we had better be on our
way senhorita

  to ressano gareia is it far she
asked

  across the river to umbesi first with-
out you bosigo loses the game senhorita
you dont know umbesi but bosigo does
they met by the river a while ago and if
they meet again it wont be by bosigos
choice

  turcan cautiously poked his head out of
the huts opening the guard was squatting
before a fire gorging himself with meat
others slept on the ground around him
turcan called to the girl softly and they fled
swiftly through the shadows circling the
huts they climbed the partially-built stock-
ade and came out upon the bank of the
slayer by stealth



river after a pause for breath turcan
led the way down-stream

  he was worried the girl slowed the
pace and he did not know how far it was
from bosigos kraal to the ford at aman-
zimtoti at any moment their escape might
be discovered bosigo would guess that they
would make for the ford and it would be
easy for him to head them off there

  at a narrow bend in the river where the
tall reeds grew out into the stream he
stopped and pointed to the opposite side
wed be safer on the other side he said
i know you can swim senhorita

  the girl looked across to the far bank
the current is swift but it is not far
she observed

  turcan looked at her doubtfully ill
make a float of reeds said he well
swim together

  the girls eyes flashed at him in the
darkness very well go make your float
said she

  turcan was busy with his knife when a
bundle fell at his side startled he looked
up quickly a white nymph-like form
flashed across his line of vision in an in-
stant it disappeared among the reeds tur-
can stared with his mouth open then he
saw her swimmfng strongly for the op-
posite bank he grabbed up the bundle of
clothes she had thrown to him and started
for the bank the snapping of a twig
brought him face about with his nerves
taut

  de cabral stood a few paces from him
the two men stood silent for a moment
their eyes locked de cabrals face showed
white about his jaws and turcan knew that
he was looking at death

  we have come to the bridge that only
one of us may cross senhor de cabrals
voice was vibrant you will stay on this
side

turcan did not answer for a moment
his face was expressionless but his
pulse raced and the blood pounded in his
ears impulse prompted him to fling him-
self upon de cabral to gamble on a miss
but a picture of the headless vultures at
umzinto flashed before his eyes the fleet-
ing seconds were like a bridge across
oblivion crumbling at his feet de cabral
was gloating

  i dont think we have come to that

bridge yet said turcan coolly if the
senhorita da cunha has made her choice
i am not aware of it

  de cabral smiled mockingly am i to
believe that you took her by force i am
not the fool she took me for i saw what
was in her mind i watched and followed
it was never my plan that you should
live it was bosigos he saw advantage in
it i can see none senhor

  what advantage do you see in shoot-
ing me de cabral with a witness to the
fact across the river asked turcan

  de cabral laughed softly you have
always under-estimated me turcan i do
not intend to kill you and be hanged for
murder bosigo will do the killing when
i take you back

  and the senhorita da cunha turcan
asked

  a naked white woman in the jungle-
she will not go far later when i have
made my escape from bosigo i will find
her a delightful discovery eh senhor
he said it in a way that made turcan
bristle but the muzzle of his colt was
steady de cabral leered at him i owe
much to your cleverness but now i have no
further need of it start walking back up
the path senhor

  turcan stood his ground there was a
faint smile on his lips you talk too much
de cabral said he you made a mistake
when you followed us alone you should
have brought your executioner along with
you i choose to die here with a witness
a look of surprised bewilderment made
de cabrals expression comical

  turcan laughed but his muscles were
tense he edged forward

de cabrals face was bloodless his
eyes shifted nervously turcan did
not give him time to think he talked
rapidly

  turcan cut him short a man can
choose to die you forget that de cabral
youd kill but you havent got the guts to
face-

  de cabral stooped suddently and grab-
bed up a heavy branch at his feet in the
same moment turcan leaped in and kicked
the gun from his hand with a yelp of pain
and rage de cabral swung at turcan with
his club the branch broke over turcans
right shoulder paralyzing his arm de

cabral came at him kicking and flailing his
fists turcan went down intent upon beat-
ing his victim into unconsciousness de
cabral turned to look for his club the
numbness was leaving turcans arm when
de cabral turned he was getting to his feet
unsteadily the portuguese rushed at him
turcan ducked under a savage blow his
arms wound around the others waist they
crashed to the ground and rolled toward
the rivers bank

  once they broke apart and circled each
other gulping the cool air into their
parched lungs de cabral was maneuver-
ing to get turcan into the path of moon-
light himself into the shadow turcan
stalked him warily toward the rivers bank
de cabral sprang as turcans foot caught
in a vine he faked falling and his arms
whipped around de cabrals waist and
lifted him bodily as he braced himself to
throw the overhanging bank crumbled un-
der his feet and they slid into the swift
stream sinking rapidly turcan fought to
break the strangle-hold de cabral had about
his neck he felt a sickening jar as the
current dashed him against a shelf of rock
the grip about his neck slackened as he
came to the surface with bursting lungs
then he saw de cabrals body roll over the
shelf and go bobbing down stream

the fighting madness left turcan he
started to run down the bank with the
vague idea of saving de cabral but his
bruised legs stiffened he fell the muscles
of his legs were knotted with cramp

  it was some time before turcan felt
able to swim the river he walked back up-
stream found the girls scanty clothes then
he waded out into the icy water when he
reached the other bank he stretched his
aching limbs and rested then he thought
of ines da cunha huddled naked among
the reeds he went in search of her calling
her name softly

  a splash drew him toward the waters
edge a white arm parted the reeds and a
pair of very angry eyes flashed up at him
over the rim of the bank my clothes if
you please senhor she snapped

  turcan grinned down at her i know

how you feel said he ill drink the
damn river before ill swim it again
turcan withdrew a bit evidently the
girl had hidden herself so well that she
had seen nothing of the struggle on the
opposite bank when she came out shaking
the water from her long black hair she
was still angry

  it is the last time senhor- she broke
off as she caught sight of turcans swoollen
face and his left eye that was all the colors
of a jungle flower

  the senhor de cabral turcan ex-
plained laconically

  the girl caught his arm her eyes bright
with alarm

  lopes where is he now 

  turcan pointed to the river ines da
cunha looked at his set face and asked no
more

  they reached ressano gareia just be-
fore dawn on the following day umbesis
boatmen had brought them to within ten
miles of the settlement

it was a flustered young commandant
who came from his bed to greet them
turcan smiled the young fellow was find-
ing it hard to reconcile the girl who stood
before him in such brazen dishabille with
the lady he had danced with at the resi-
dencia

  i remember you senhor vincente
ines said do you recall dancing with
me

  he bent over her hand that is some-
thing a man could not forget but i do
not understand

  she interrupted him i am anxious to
meet the women of your post for obvious
reasons senhor my future husband the
senhor turcan will explain

  your future husband-the senhor
turcan stammered the commandant
but i-

  your surprise is natural senhor said
she smiling at turcan senhor turcan
i believe was not aware of it himself until
this moment do you think he will refuse
me senhor

  a gleam came into turcans eyes he
definitely will not

jim fords war safari tracked the white fetish to the moaning
veldt of the fire devils but even his lions teeth juju could not
keep the drums of death from beating over bwana helen

the long string of giant

masai warriors in jim fords war
safari moved at a hurried jog-trot
through twisting tongues of dank river fog
that licked the lower terraces of the jun-
gle the fog smeared a dripping moisture
over everything on the old slave trail that
jim followed it made the footing wet and
slippery but the warriors dug in their
bare toes and didnt slacken pace as the
safari hurried toward bill whites coffee
plantation trying desperately to get there
ahead of the brutal gang of akesi coming
from the opposite direction and bent on
murdering bill and his wife alice and

their beautiful nineteen year old daughter
helen

  jims spy the furtive clever little wa-
suli hunch-back ng gamon had fallen ex-
hausted at jims plantation two days be-
fore and gasped out in his peculiar high
pitched voice the warning that the killers
would hit bill whites coffee plantation
soon just when the spy didnt know ng
gamon was a little man less than five feet
tall but a fierce pride burned bright in
his black eyes he was a wasuli he wore
nothing on his mis-shapen body but a
breech clout and a belt

  the big black fighting men in the safari




jungle stories

were nearly naked wore nothing but soft
tanned antelope skin breech-clouts and
wide belts of the same material but each
man carried a long wide bladed spear a
war club and a bolo-like pangas their
ebony-like powerful bodies glistened with
sweat they were masai the biggest and
best fighting men on the congo

  jim ford used a stout stick to help him
along the slippery trail he was big broad
shouldered powerfully built-a good match
for his warriors he had a fighting mans
blue-gray eyes and square jaw and a lock
of black hair stuck out from under his
white topee he wore a khaki shirt open
at the neck showing a tanned hairy chest
stout laced boots came up over the legs
of his khaki breeches two forty-five
automatic pistols swung in well worn hol-
sters from his belt

  hanging on jim fords left breast was
a special gris-gris made from three big
lions teeth that had been given to him by
a famous witch doctor jim would take his
oath that he was not superstitious but he
was never seen without this fetish

  the big masai chief mkada standing
six feet eight in his bare feet naked ex-
cept for a soft tanned antelope hide breech-
clout and strips of long haired monkey fur
around his elbows and knees marched
close on jims heels he was true to type
big and tall like most all of the masai
tribe the big fellow was muttering dark
curses his piercing black eyes always busy
watching for sign

  and it was with good cause that he and
jim ford were worried for more than a
month past no white planter had been safe
from a band of cold blooded killers who
ravaged the coffee plantations striking
killing where least expected driving the
black help away in superstitious fear leav-
ing the coffee to rot on the trees and in
the bins

  no plantation owner could tell when his
turn might come there was a reign of ter-
ror in the congo valley where every white
man went armed ready to shoot at the
drop of a hat the first to get it had been
little easy going jens jensen over on the
clopo river poor jens and his wife olga
had been literally hacked to pieces in their
plantation house in the dark of the tropi-
cal night

  and there had been nothing to hint the

identity of the savage murderers but the
spoor of a huge leopard leading off into
the jungle it was the dread sign of the
akesi leopard mens murder society those
vicious killers who murdered for pay

  after jens jensen and his wife had
come big powerful domineering pete
hawkins clear down on the lindi river
he had been murdered in the same way
and still no clues except that big leopard
track that led away from the house into
the jungle who was behind this deliber-
ate organized system of murder many
guessed but nobody could prove anything
however all agreed that it was the fiend-
ish effort of some murderer to force all
the big planters out of the country force
them to sell to somebody but    who
was that somebody

  all of this reign of terror had been go-
ing on ever since the big agricultural
convention at stanleyville gathered at the
falls city were coffee planters from near
and far jim ford dropped in a day after
it opened and thus incurred the impatient
wrath of the right honorable william
peters who was chairman

  half the planters were dozing in the
close heat showing little interest in the
right honorable peters pompous talk on
the subject of grating the coffee tree when
jim ford entered the convention rooms
the minute jim entered and stood waiting
for a pause before looking for a seat
peters stopped fixed his monocle glared
for a moment then well-well an
who the bloody hell might you be he
bawled

  jims temper blazed but he managed to
say quietly jim ford of hapana-simba
plantation sorry im late but 

  blawsted hamerican of course youd
be late by my rights i should deny you a
seat at this convention wot the bleedin
ell do you mean interruptin my spee   
the work of this body of planters i
should

  now wait a minute peters you cant
bawl me out like that jin napped he
was striding down the aisle toward the
chair when a huge black looking portu-
guese planter jumped up and yelled shut
up and sit down americano i  

  that was as far as he got before jim
fords hard fist sent him sprawling over a
chair the hall was in an uproar every-
three lions teeth



body yelling cursing one of jims friends
took a swing at peters jim had a host of
friends here and before things quieted
down and the right honorable left in a
furious burst of outraged dignity closely
followed by the big portugese de acosta
the provincial police came in to restore
order

  at the door peters turned and bawled
a gang of ill mannered swine some day
before long ill own all your silly little
plantations then ill kick you all out of
africa

  datsa right yelled de acosta and
i helpa da honorable

  during all this racket and confusion a
tall athletic looking man wearing a gold
rimmed monocle had been leaning against
a wall near a window an amused sarcas-
tic grin on his face he was a touring
german named kurt von stern who was
trying to buy some coffee plantations for
his firm in europe he was making every
effort to be agreeable to everyone but a
certain contempt a kind of arrogance
cropped out in spite of his amiable efforts
he had been turned down on every hand

as jims war safari rushed through
the jungle it was steadily getting
lighter then suddenly the hot tropical
sun literally bounced up over the horizon
the shadows were swallowed by a white
glare of light and at once it was hot the
swamps drew in their searching tongues of
cool fog and the jungles steamed and stank
again after the cool of the night

  even the animals shrank away from the
all consuming heat of the sun the big
crocodiles left their hunting and crawled
into the swirling waters of the mighty
congo a quarter mile to jims left and
rolled over just their sinister snouts and
eyes showing the jungle cats gave up
their endless blood search and sought the
deep moist shade far up to the safaris
right elephants trumpeted in the deep
shade as they rocked restlessly on their
huge feet swinging their trunks this way
and that ever searching the breeze for the
scent of enemies traces of danger

  with the coming of the bright glare of
the sunlight jim fords keen blue-gray
eyes at once picked up a half dozen specks
high in the blue they were diving earth-
ward in wide swoops with startling speed

sounding their weird skirling shrieks as
they came

  jim grunted at chief mkada gestured
and the huge masai warrior rumbled
wah death is here before us but may-
be simba live for make kill last night
maybe vulture come for get meat simba
not eat maybe 

  yeah maybe  jim cut in that likeable
grin that was so characteristic of him
spreading over his smooth shaven rugged
features for a moment he was hoping
desperately that young helen bill whites
laughing happy tom-boy daughter was all
right the last time he had seen the girl
she had been swinging swiftly through the
jungle trees on the end of a long liana like
an ape laughing and shouting with the
sheer joy of living

  but there was doubt in jims tones as
he answered mkada and as if to justify
his doubt at that moment a wild chorus of
dog-like howls that was taken up from all
sides by scores of dangoes broke the morn-
ing quiet the safari glimpsed whole packs
of the cowardly wild dogs racing through
the tangle all going toward the same des-
tination that jim ford sought the ani-
mals smelled blood nothing else would ex-
cite them this way

  chief mkada turned his head and
growled a few short words deep in his
mighty chest to the string of big masai
fighting men hurrying over the trail behind
him they shouted fierce eager replies
lowered the points of their broad bladed
spears loosened war clubs in their slings
fingered the broad sharp bolo-like pangas
hanging handy at their belts

  chief mkada and these twenty big
fighting men had marched on many a wild
safari with jim ford-each had cause to
remember the big planter with deep debts
of gratitude for his many acts of friend-
liness toward them and their families they
were fiercely loyal to him and so it was
that when jim ford took the chore on his
own broad shoulders to rid the valley of
the mysterious murder menace that rav-
aged it and held palaver with his old
masai friend chief mkada these men
ever eager for battle rushed to jims plan-
tation to join him

  mkada and jim ford increased their
pace they were hoping against hope that
they had been misinformed by their spies


jungle stories

that the mysterious deadly murderers who
killed for a price had not struck again
   this time at bill whites coffee
plantation now only about a mile away

  then chief mkada in his eagerness to
find out if they had won in their race with
death broke away from his place behind
jim ford and drove at a crouching run up
the slope

  he covered the steep slope like most
men would run on the level

  when he reached the crest of the low
ridge that he climbed the big masai halted
as though he had hit an invisible stone wall
his spear swung once around his head in
a wide circle he rammed the butt of the
spear shaft into the soft ground turned his
back to the thirsty blade and his big shoul-
ders bowed low his gesture was eloquent
of defeat and a groan that was a strange
mixture of regret and fierce rage ran over
the warriors following jim ford jim
cursed feelingly paused for a moment
thoughtfully fingering the three lions teeth
hanging on his left breast then hurried
up the slope

  once more the mysterious murder band
had struck despite the war safaris furi-
ous drive to reach bill whites plantation
ahead of it this was not jim fords first
try at stopping this carnival of murder
but the result was the same-always he
and his masai warriors had been just a lit-
tle too late but he had to find out for cer-
tain just who was paying the akesi work-
ing them up to murder the white planters
the idea of quitting never entered his
mind

three big disgusting vultures rode
the ridge pole of bill whites planta-
tion house as jim fords war safari
tramped through the rows of young coffee
trees toward it the smell of death was
strong about the place and jim snorted it
from his nostrils violently the huge black
and gray feathered scavenger birds were
the only evidence of life on the plantation
they sounded their wild skirling shrieks
and flopped clumsily away to the limbs of
a bare dead tree as the safari arrived

  all of the native help had disappeared
in superstitious fear of the akesi of their
dead bwana and memsahib and unless they
were brought back soon the jungle would
reclaim its own it would overrun all the

planted area the work of years would
be lost

  the inside of the comfortable plantation
house was a bloody shambles when jim
ford went in bill and his wife alice had
been hacked to pieces jim went fearfully
from room to room dreading what he
might see behind each door but he found
no trace of young helen he yelled for
mkada started the warriors searching the
plantation for sign of her

  surprise had evidently been complete
for the akesi but even at that bill white
had killed one of them with his pistol his
companions had left without bothering to
take the dead savage with them he was
sprawled on the floor a slender medium
sized muscular black shape of a man his
torso and head covered with a finely tanned
leopard skin with the tail dangling behind
on his hands was a crude imitation of the
claws of a leopard done in sharp steel
even in death his features were a clear
index to inborn cruelty brutality

  a half hour later jim ford was busy
building a double coffin directing a gang
digging a grave in the plantation yard
when one of his masai warriors ran in
with a story of some huge leopard tracks
that he had found

  jim merely grunted he had seen those
giant leopard tracks leading away into the
jungle from jens jensens house and from
pete hawkins house after murder had
been committed and he had seen how all
sign all tracks had disappeared in the
deep jungle within a half mile of the scene
of the crime in each case but he did not
pause in his work until the last shovelful of
earth had been heaped on the mound in
bill whites plantation yard then he hur-
ried to the spot where the warrior had
found the leopard tracks

  chief mkada was already there he
was crouched low over a single imprint of
a leopards paw an imprint half again as
big as any that jim had seen in his many
years in africa

  the big masai glanced up at jim a
sarcastic grin on his black face he
grunted dangoes fools they think they
can fool us he jumped erect stamped his
big bare foot on the leopards track that
sign not fit for make by animal he
snarled made by akesi man then the
big warriors expression changed he beck-
three lions teeth



oned jim and strode off through the jun-
gle a hundred yards farther back in the
tangle he halted glanced at his bwana
pointed at a small boot track in the damp
ground jim tensed turned white helen
he whispered mkada nodded solemnly
maybe-so akesi take girl give to man
that pay for kill planters--make present
but maybe not gone yet i look he lev-
elled his great spear raced off yelling to
his warriors

  jim slumped to a seat on a fallen log
the worst had happened-the thing that
he had dreaded most ever since this reign
of terror had started helen was very dear
to him and he was looking forward to the
day when they could be married they had
been making plans getting things in order
at his hapana simba plantation house to
receive the bride and now   

  when mkada came back to where jim
ford still sat his mind a chaos of depres-
sion the big masai had a puzzled frown on
his face no more sign he grumbled
quickly akesi leopard man not fit for fly
like vulture girl no can fly but no more
track no more sign on ground he
paused looked at jim sympathy plain in
his black eyes then he said i not tell
before but akesi warriors got fire god
for worship fire god priest there he
pointed at a distant line of small half ex-
tinct volcanoes maybe akesi warrior give
memsahib white to fire priest for kill so
fire god like akesi warriors

  jim ford jumped to his feet strode up
and down for a minute then he got hold
of himself with an effort paused then
suddenly he wheeled his expression
changed he was remembering the last time
he had seen auburn haired brown eyed
helen she had come swinging down from
a big jungle limb clinging to a stout liana
and landed beside him

  jim pointed up at the trees and hanging
lianas overhead the monkeys do not run
on the ground and risk being eaten by a
leopard when they have trees to travel in
he said maybe the akesi leopard men do
like their brothers the monkeys and travel
for a time through the branches leaving
no sign for us he grabbed a long liana
went back as far as he could then took off
with a run his swing landed him on a
thick branch ten feet above the ground

-jungle stories-spriing

  mkadas eyes lighted up wah my
head is no better than the stupid chimpan-
zees he growled he tossed his big spear
to a warrior seized a strong liana took a
quick run and landed beside jim his sharp
eyes instantly noted a patch of scuffed
crushed moss on the limb

  the chief growled it is as the bwana
said the akesi move through the trees
like their brothers the monkeys when they
would hide their trail mebby-so they make
the little memsahib go in trees like monkey
too then he was away through the jun-
gle swinging from branch to branch like a
big black ape jim followed him more
carefully

  mkada travelled surely steadily as
though following sign on the ground for
about a mile then one of his warriors on
the ground below him shouted stood point-
ing at human foot prints in the moist earth
mkada and jim came swinging down out
of the trees and landed at a run immedi-
ately the chief was off through the tangle
following sign like a bloodhound a grim
light in his black eyes his warriors at his
heels

  jim ford was right behind the chief
as long as things were going well they
were closing the distance to the murderers
he said nothing the sun was straight
overhead their trail leading up steeply into
the mountains toward the line of volcanoes
when he finally called a halt

hief mkada and his warriors
were keyed up excited and eager for
battle they were fiercely impatient at the
delay while we sit on our heels talking
like old women the akesi get away the
chief growled at jim must we rest and
eat the meat and manioc that we carry
while they go on  are the akesi better
men than the masai can they go farther
without food agh

  you talk like the chimpanzee again
jim snapped some white man pays the
akesi to kill the white planters we have
never had trouble here with the akesi be-
fore what good to kill the akesi and not
find the man who pays he would only get
other leopard men to kill for him maybe
he will fix so he can buy up ail the coffee
plantations cheap when the planters are all
killed or driven off but this time his kill-
ers have taken my memsahib this time i


jungle stories

will know who pays the akesi when we go
back to our home kralls this time he
dies	

  chief mkada looked crestfallen he
turned away and hunkered down in the
shade the white man must lead-the
black man must follow he muttered it
has always been so black man made like
white man but black man live for think
slow

  jim hunkered among the warriors let
us hold palaver he said quietly what
town  what house  he asked pointing up
at the high craggy range toward which the
akesi sign had been leading them all morn-
ing a range that had the smoking inactive
small volcanoes scattered on it

  the masai warriors shook their heads
their eyes rolled wildly one of them said
in the dialect which mkada translated
agh that high place is the land of fire
it is the land of bad juju it is the land of
devils who eat men alive no man can go
there and live for come away again better
we catch akesi before reach that devils
land

  jim ford saw right there that he was
up against the greatest obstacle to progress
in all the dark continent-superstitious
fear he thought for a moment idly finger-
ing that lion tooth fetish hanging on his
chest then he said quietly his blue-gray
eyes steady on the warriors i am not
afraid of the devils who eat men alive i
will make strong juju my juju is stronger
than the devils who eat men

  he stood up checked his two forty-five
automatics i will go to the land of fire
even to catch the akesi leopard men and
find out who pays them he said quietly
then when i find that man i will kill
is it that the great and brave masai fight-
ing men are afraid to follow me you have
not seen these devils who eat men alive
ha it is of something that you have not
seen that you are afraid like little totoes
in their mothers arms he started off
trailing the plain sign of footprints

  instantly the chief arid his men were
on their feet strung out behind him
fighting men will follow now mkada
said to jim but when we reach the land
of fire  he left the rest hanging in
the air but me chief mkada will go
where bwana jimford goes chief mkada
will fight for his bwana

  jims friendly slow grin spread over his
face thats all i want to know chief i
knew i could bet on you you are a great
fighting man he said we two will kill
the man who pays the murdering akesi

  and at that moment a big blue golokoto
sounded his booming yet liquid wh-o-o-q
wh-o-o-o from the jungle near by every
warrior stopped short in his tracks listen-
ing waiting for the call to be repeated but
the big blue pigeon remained silent several
of the warriors grounded their spears
even mkada halted there was a look of
fear in their eyes it is well known by all
on the congo that if the golokoto calls but
once as a safari is about to trek some man
of that safari will die before night if he
ignores the warning marches out

  most of the warriors turned back to the
palaver ground just left they were sullen
ashamed for fear someone would think
that they were cowards but they were tak-
ing no chances despite danger of this
supreme insult

  jim stood looking at them for a minute
then without a word he strode off up to
the trail alone despite the pleas of the war-
riors for him to turn back wait until after
midnight

  jim had covered maybe a mile when a
warrior closed up behind him with a pant-
ing rush the big planter did not even
look around he knew that this would be
chief mkada unable to stand his bwanas
contempt willing to risk death-anything
rather than that jim smiled his crooked
friendly smile but said nothing he was
pleased    and relieved

  they had gone maybe a half mile to-
gether when jim ford stopped suddenly
his hands flashed to his automatics chief
mkada leaped back his spear levelled
jim had caught a brief flash of  a spotted
yellow hide in the jungle maybe akesi
warriors he snapped to mkada

  the chief crouched low took one look
beneath the brush grabbed jims shoulder
and tore out back down the trail at top
speed he didnt go far a hundred yards
and he checked wheeled his back against a
rocky cliff then his weird war yell burst
from his lips like the blast of a steam siren

  jim spotted a black figure partly cov-
ered by a leopard skin his right forty-five
blasted the warrior hit the ground rolled
and slashed for a moment then lay still
three lions teeth



a half dozen leopard skin clad war-
riors sifted through the jungle and
came leaping to the attack chief mkadas
spear cut and slashed and jabbed furiously
there was a grim smile on the big masais
face this was his business-fighting it
was the breath of life to him

  jim didnt waste a shot he fired stead-
ily his aim sure deadly the akesi
couldnt stand gun fire spears and knives
were their weapons not guns they broke
ran swiftly for the jungle the chief
leaped after them brought the flat of his
big spear blade around with terrific force
and knocked the last of the akesi flat he
crouched over the man his spear point
pricking the black skin over his heart the
two jabbered fiercely back and forth the
akesi warrior suddenly jerked his hand
from under a pile of leaves slashed at
mkadas leg with a dagger trying to
hamstring him the chief leaped high and
without moving the point of his spear
from the mans chest threw his whole
weight on the spear shaft it was enough
the warrior wilted lifeless

  there was a rush of bare feet on the
trail and chief mkadas warriors charged
up mkada stood carefully cleaning his
great spear blade he did not even glance
at his men they took in the situation
turned and ran back to the palaver grounds
the curse of the golokoto had not yet
ended they were taking no chances

  chief mkada what did you get out
of that warrior jim asked swabbing
sweat from his head and neck reloading
the magazines of his forty-fives

  mkada took his time about answering
but finally he said akesi take little
memsahib white for give to white sahib
in land of fire spose white sahib no want
then give to fire priest in land of fire
wah

  jim ford wasted no time in further
questioning cmon mkada he growled
weve got a job cut out for us ive got
a fire priest and a white man to kill and
im in a hell of a hurry to get it done
he led off up the trail at a jog-trot chief
mkada close behind him once the chief
grunted more better run faster mebby-
so no hurry you lose you woman-fire
priest cut heart out on big block of lava
rock from land of fire

  jim and the chief moved swiftly climb-

ing climbing steadily all afternoon they
were rapidly getting closer to the land of
fire they could even catch an occasional
whiff of sulphurous smoke from the sub-
terranean fires up there sign of the akesi
was very fresh but they did not glimpse
the warriors once a half hour before
dark they crossed a rushing stream both
men drank then returned a mouthful of
water to the torrent it was good juju and
no man on safari neglected it

  at last jim ford saw something that he
had been watching for for an hour it was
a thick clump of the dainty casurian trees
that grew close to the ground up a short
slope from the trail that they followed it
was rapidly getting dark and jim turned
in that direction here we camp he an-
nounced simply to mkada he knew that
under these casurians they would not be
bothered by the millions of mosquitoes that
swarmed in the air while they rested and
slept the odor of the trees though not
disagreeable repelled the pests

  they would get lost from their trail in
no time in the dark lose all trace of the
akesi they followed jim begrudged every
second that they rested but he knew that
it would be folly to try to go on in the
night they opened the lunches that they
carried and ate

 from midnight on chief mkada
watched and listened for the approach of
his warriors reasoning that they would
come hurrying up the trail to overtake their
chief and their bwana as soon as the
curse of the golokoto should let them he
muttered to jim once those fools they
believe in what they can not see what their
spears will not kill they are like little to-
toes but they are not cowards no they
are masai fighting men

  jim ford knew that he was right no
he said they are all brave warriors luck
is not with us thats all

  jim slept lightly in short cat naps he
was up prowling the camp several times
during the night impatient to be on the
trail again almost wild with fear for
helen at about an hour before dawn he
was brought full awake by a low sound of
guttural talk coming from the trail below
he laid his hand lightly on mkadas
shoulder

  the chief was awake instantly but he
made no sound did not move jim whis-


jungle stories

pered to him told him what he had heard
mkada asked my warriors but jim
shook his head it was not the masai
tongue too early for your men to get
here yet we came a long way

  the two crouched in the dense shadows
of the casurian trees all their senses alert
their weapons ready for a few minutes
then they crept silently down toward the
trail and waited the men who had passed
down the trail were out of sight and
hearing

  jim and the chief waited listened for
more than a half hour then they heard
the men coming back up the trail jim held
his forty-five automatic cocked and ready
chief mkada swung his mighty spear
around stood behind a clump of bushes
he was poised set to attack

  jim leaned close to the chief can you
talk the language of the akesi he whis-
pered

  fit for talk it much good quick they
live for come close what i say mkada
answered

  ask them where is their white bwana
tonight chief maybe we will learn some-
thing

  wah they come now two akesi

  chief mkada muttered a string of gut-
tural words

instantly both of the akesi war-
riors answered each thinking probably
that the other had asked the question one
of them added those cowardly masai
dangoes must have turned back but i saw
them following us yesterday the fools are
afraid of the land of fire and the empty
stories of man eating devils there he
laughed shortly it was the last sound that
he ever made

  cowardly masai dangoes that did it
for the proud mkada his heavy keen
spear blade flashed across in a vicious
swinging slash the leopard mans head all
but left his shoulders the other akesi
uttered a startled yell commenced a bolt
jims forty-five shot a rstreak of orange
colored flame and the man collapsed chief
mkada bathed his spear point in the blood
of this man again it was good juju

  the chief turned to jim akesi dangoes
say their white bwana fit for stay in his
camp much close to land of fire much
close to temple of fire priest he said im-

portantly they say that palaver of man
eating devils is boon-all lies

  so jim snapped ive thought all
along ever since the convention at stanley-
ville that one of the white men who was
there was behind this maybe the limey
maybe the portugese de acosta that the
murderous fool was using the akesi as his
tools-trying to drive us all to sell out
cheap so maybe hed like to build a pow-
erful coffee empire in the congo huh ill
show him about that before im through
ill teach him something about africa that
he never read in a book

  jim ford turned hit the trail for the
land of fire at once even though it was still
completely dark chief mkada followed
close on the heels of his bwana he was
carefully cleaning the blade of his spear

  the jungle dropped away as they
climbed great blocks of black lava forced
them to wind about among them climb
over some jump down to the trail again
both were panting sweating from the
tough going but they kept doggedly at the
trek

  a half hour later the sudden tropical
dawn bloomed full blown in the east and at
once the air was warm and the jungle
came alive noisily the huge blocks and
lumps of lava through which the trail
wound started to radiate heat then jim
stopped short at the edge of a huge bowl
that was about a half mile in diameter he
sneaked closer peered over the rim of the
place carefully the steady rumbling and
roaring the hiss of escaping steam in the
old crater was deafening

  below him the trail ran down steeply
winding about snake-like among steadily
gurgling boiling mud springs jets of live
steam shot from these paint pots and
there were wide cracks in the ground from
which black smoke flowed pools of clear
water here and there steamed and bub-
bled as they boiled out near the center of
this old crater a cone of dark lava stood up
maybe a hundred feet high and a plume of
black smoke drifted lazily from its peak
all the space inside the bowl was strewn
with huge blocks and lumps of black lava

  jim turned and glanced at mkada a
crooked reckless grin on his face the
chief squatted quietly on his heels gazing
at the fearful spectacle below them his
eyes unreadable hard but there was no
three lions teeth



fear in those inscrutable black eyes i
see no place can find fit for them dango
white bvana and his akesi can stop he
said it is fitting that they live on other
side on that high ground there not too
hot like here high maybe cool at night

  yeah jim said thoughtfully finger-
ing his lion tooth fetish guess youre
right chief but that bowl is hot as hell i
can feel it from here maybe 

  wah too hot maybe can go around

i	live for look-see he was on his feet
moving furtively among the huge blocks of
lava heading to the right along the rim of
the bowl he was back in less than five
minutes perspiration running down his
face he shrugged his huge shoulders
too hot no man can live for go that
way he grunted as he started off to the
left

  the chief was back even  sooner than
before he said no word but shrugged
and swiped a stream of sweat from his
face

  jim ford was studying the heights across
the bowl carefully he could see a column
of lighter colored smoke-wood smoke-
climbing up from behind a knife edged low
ridge in the early morning air

  he pointed it out to chief mkada

  up theres our man chief or im
badly fooled he said im betting that
his camp is under that wood smoke be-
hind that low sharp ridge out of the heat
from the crater guess that light colored
smoke would be from his breakfast fire
and maybe    look look mkada
down below that light colored smoke up
on that big block of black lava can you
see it mkada

 chief mkada scrambled forward
stared his eyes flared he panted with ex-
citement jim ford and chief mkada
were gazing spellbound at the huge form
of a negro robed from chin to heels in
flowing billowing white fabric that swirled
about his giants form in the hot blast of
air from the old crater he held his arms
out level with the ground on each side
then swept them to their full height above
his head he bowed low fell to his knees
pressed his forehead to the lava time after
time then abruptly as jim and the chief
stared fascinated a cloud of black smoke
belched from a hole in front of the block
of lava where he stood it hid the ghostly

form of the priest and when it drifted
away he was gone

  that    fire priest mkada half
whispered his eyes wild he will kill-
kill-kill on sacrifice block to please his
fire god much times i have heard   
man or woman tied by hands and feet on
big block longer and wider than a masai
warrior-that fire priest in white cloth
stand over man or woman with big
knife  

  he and jim leaped to their feet ive
got to get over there jim panted maybe
that devil is getting ready to kill helen as
a sacrifice to his blasted crazy god

  wah but how we live for get there 
too hot the big masai growled staring at
the inferno below them maybe better we
live for go back run go around he mo-
tioned to the right

  jim ford said nothing just pointed at
the row of small cones all smoking stead-
ily like the one in front of them and ex-
tending for miles in both directions

  the chief thumped the ground angrily
with the butt of his spear shaft agh  for
walk around maybe fit for take two-
three day no good he growled

  jim rose to his feet sign shows that
akesi walked across this old crater jim
said excitedly what akesi can do we
can do chief

  mkada jumped to his feet from his
heel-squat wah he bellowed we go
now kill akesi kill fool priest if akesi
  he wheeled suddenly looked at
jim held his hand over his mouth in warn-
ing then mkada slipped quietly back
down the trail his spear level

  he was out of sight among the huge
blocks of lava almost immediately jim
heard a shrill screech from down there
where mkada had disappeared and a min-
ute later the chief came striding into view
lugging under his powerful right arm the
little wasuli hunch-back ng gamon whom
they had left at hapana simba plantation
to rest up after he had reported that the
akesi were going to attack bill whites
plantation

  the chief was laughing loudly it was
the way of the negro already he had
partly forgotten his awe at sight of the
white robed priest    fear for the
safety of helen white all that had al-
most been driven from his mind by the


jungle stories

capture of the little hunch-back now he
could laugh again

ng gamon was kicking scowling
cursing shrilly in his high pitched
voice it all looked anything but funny to
him his immense dignity had been out-
raged

  mkada dropped the little man in front
of jim ford i hear noise like small ani-
mal down there he said i think maybe
akesi fit for come behind us make fight
but i find little spit-cat he was grinning
broadly he had very little respect for ng
gamon as a fighting man and if a man
couldnt fight then what good was he
that was mkadas philosophy

  ng gamon stared at mkada for a mo-
ment then deliberately ran over and spat
on his shadow the little hunch-back
turned hitched up his gazelle skin breech
clout and faced jim ford me make fit
for come here for help you bwana quick
after rest make me fit for run trails again
he said with a dignity that was impressive
despite his misshapen undersized body he
stood less than five feet in his bare feet
two nights i live for sleep in baobab
tree like the apes so lions and leopards no
eat me he went on i fit for come here
quick like 

  mkadas laughter interrupted him
maybe the mother monkey hold you in
her arms like little monkey toto when you
sleep in baobab tree he jeered how
else you fit for not fall into lions mouth

  ng gamon snarling scurried around
the big masai and again deliberately spat
on his shadow mkada laughed loudly
made a playful pass at-ng gamon with his
big spear had a warrior been so imprud-
ent as to spit bn the chiefs shadow one
of them would have died suddenly

  jim growled lets hear what ng ga-
mon has to tell us chief after all he has
been here in the land of fire as our spy
come on now ng gamon how can i get
to the other side of this damned crater
quick 

  the little man strutted back and forth
importantly for a moment then with a
sidewise glance of contempt at mkada he
said it is fitting that we cross the land
of fire from here the akesi leopard men
live for go that way they are not wasuli
they are not even masai he sneered to

the chief but they live for walk through
land of fire and no get burned up i am
only wasuli i am not big clumsy elephant
-masai but i walk that trail i not burn
   the little man suddenly pulled a
wavy edged twelve inch dagger from its
scabbard where it was hung on a monkey
fur belt around his waist and started for
the trail i will lead he said importantly
in his high pitched voice there was a
bragging aggressive swagger to his mis-
shapen shoulders that brought a roar of
laugher from chief mkada

  but jim ford arose and at once stepped
over the edge of the bowl started the steep
descent close behind ng gamon who was
as agile as an ape chief mkada followed

  they had nearly reached the bottom of
the slope leading into the crater when a
sharp slapping report set echoes bouncing
back and forth across the bowl even above
the roaring in that inferno and a piece of
lava within inches of jims head fell in a
cloud of dust

  all three ducked ran for the place where
the trail led in among the great blocks of
lava

  another shot and a slug jolted into
a block whined and ricocheted away with
a vicious snarl

  hes got sentries out whoever he is
jim snapped hes got us spotted now
come on well clean this up quick

  ng gamon paused uncertain but jim
ford immediately pushed by him and with
a forty-five automatic in his right hand he
went at a crouching run following the
plain trail made by the many akesi feet
that had crossed the land of fire on their
way to murder chief mkada with his
great height was bent nearly double to
keep out of sight of the gunner on the
knife edged ridge on the opposite side but
he had an eager gleam in his black eyes
there was an alertness in his movements
that said much 

  the ground was hot the big blocks of
lava on each side of the trail radiated a
steady wave of heat smoke from open fis-
sures in the ground hung in the dead at-
mosphere of the bowl like a fog it was
stifling choking

  then abruptly jim was brought to a
halt by a circular pool of gently boiling
water the trail ended six feet short of the
pool jim looked around uncertainly for a
three lions teeth

 

moment stood fingering that lions tooth
fetish hanging on his shirt

  ng gamon scurried forward from be-
hind chief mkada he stood pointing at
a ruge block of lava to his left trail fit
for go over that way he said in his high
pitched tones but the little mans voice
quavered it was plain that the threat of
rifle fire had him uneasy

  perspiration was running in streams
from all three the chief and ng gamon
even with the quarter inch layer of callous
on the soles of their feet lifted one foot at
a time held it up away from the hot lava
floored trail

  jim growled that must have been a
white man doing that shooting must have
a telescopic sight on his rifle well have
to move fast to get up over that block of
lava and down the other side without get-
ting shot ill bet that devil has the range
to every spot on this trail figured to a
gnats eyebrow

  he turned to ng gamon where does
this trail lead from the top of that block
of lava  he asked

  the little man was already giddy from
the great heat but he piped up fit for
go across top--jump down on trail again
over there he was pointing

  follow me one at a time jim or-
dered he dropped his automatic into its
holster got a foothold on the side of the
block of lava leaped to the top and raced
across

  a rifle slug tore into the lava then an-
other threw fragments into jims face be-
fore he could leap down to the trail but
he was not hit when ng gamon came
sliding down off the block backwards jim
growled that blasted killer can shoot all
right well have to look out now

  is sothe little man muttered faintly
there was a queer furtive look in his
eyes being shot at narrowly missed by a
man who was nearly eight hundred yards
away was just about too much for ng
gamon his was not a reckless disposition

at that instant ng gamon jumped
wildly to one side just in time to
avoid being crushed by mkada as he
hurtled down off the block bellowing loud-
ly the chief was rubbing a red streak
along his side over his ribs striding
around angrily

  chief you hit jim asked stepping
toward the big fellow anxiously

  no no hit burn mkada yelled
fingering a long graze mark where a high
powered slug had passed but i fit for
look while up there he waved a big
hand at the top of the block of lava i see
akesi  he held up his hands with
seven fingers showing akesi live for
come run much fast they come for try
kill us for sure now we fight kill

  he searched the ground found out
where the trail led away and stepped out
fast the heat in the old crater was ter-
rific almost unendurable now it was like
a great oven everything-the ground the
blocks of lava the air was a quivering mass
of heat perspiration ran down the full
length of mkadas great ebony body in
streams from time to time he dashed
sweat from his eyes but he was consumed
by one great desire-to get the akesi war-
riors within reach of his big spear

  jim was close on his heels an automatic
gripped in each hand the hammers cocked
and ready he too was bathed in perspira-
tion he could hear and feel the sweat
squelching in his boots as he moved ahead
at a crouching run once he glanced be-
hind for ng gamon the little man was
nowhere in sight that likeable grin spread
over jims rugged features he didnt
blame the little hunch-back too much this
would be no place for a man of his size
when they met the akesi

  it suddenly occurred to jim that the
leopard men knew this hells playground
better than he and mkada did they were
just skirting a deep clear pool of gently
boiling water across a space fifty yards
wide that was clear of lava blocks and
jim glanced down into its clear depths
quickly he was startled to see the com-
plete skeleton of a man stretched full
length on the bottom of the pool maybe
fifteen feet down shreds of a skin breech
clout still clung to the bones bleached
white by the chemically charged water
some black had evidently tried crossing
here without a guide at night maybe the
sight came as a shock to jim sobered him

  jim turned his head slowed his pace
and was just opening his mouth to yell to
the chief that they had better look out for
an ambush when seven akesi warriors
burst from behind a big lump of lava and


jungle stories

came for them fast with a high wild yell

  before jim could recover from his sur-
prise and fire the two warriors in the lead
checked hurled their spears mkada neat-
ly parried the one thrown at him jim
ducked low and felt the wind of a spear as
it passed over him landed in the pool of
boiling water

  four of the spear men rushed mkada
at top speed one came for jim ford the
charge was lightning fast it all hap-
pened before he could get set raise his
pistols weight of numbers forced the
chief back his great spear cut and slashed
and jabbed furiously but still he had to
give ground

  four against one-killers odds

  two of the leopard men were wounded
bleeding freely but they -fought unchecked
they were crazed fanatical with blood lust
in an instant mkada was on the very
edge of the pool of boiling water about to
be driven in to a horrible death

  then jim fords two automatics were
blazing his own attacker was down he
turned his slugs on chief mkadas en-
emies one went down from the terrific
shock of a steel jacketed forty-five slug
then another hit the burning hot trail
they were quick to see that their chances
for a surprise victory were gone that only
death waited them here they broke started
to run for the protection of the great lava
blocks

  the two who had-thrown their spears
   and missed    swung past the big
block of lava that had been the hiding place
for their ambush and as the last one ran
by a small hunch-backed demon with a
twelve inch wavy edged dagger flung him-
self like a jungle cat from the top of the
block of lava and landed on the akesis
shoulders the demons long blade was
slashing cutting stabbing in a perfect
frenzy of destruction in a matter of sec-
onds the akesi warrior was party decapi-
tated fell to the hot ground ng gamon
still slashing and stabbing in a good outlet
of the killers instinct that his size had too
long kept pent up in his small misshapen
body

  mkada was in hot pursuit of the two
akesi warriors who had escaped jims
slugs they both carried wounds from the
chiefs great spear were weakening fast
from loss of blood but they were running

  frantically dodging hiding using their
superior knowledge of the turns and twists
narrow places among the lava blocks the
chief was implacable in his hunt for them
wouldnt rest until he had killed both

  and as jim started out again on the
trail to the fire temple alone the last thing
he saw was the little wasuli hunch-back
ng gamon still crouching over his victim
methodically plying his dagger the little
mans long pent up killer instinct his de-
sire to be considered a warrior among the
men of his tribe was not yet sated

jim ford moved carefully cautiously
toward the knife edged low ridge on
the other side of the crater he couldnt
help thinking how lucky he and the chief
had been during the fight that the rifle-
man with his telescopic sighted rifle could
not see them in among the giant lava
blocks the chief especially loomed up
over the smaller more agile akesi his
fear for helen white had grown steadily
since he and the chief had seen the fanat-
ical fire priest at his devotions

  now jim was in the shadows of that
knife edged ridge he had not exposed
himself for an instant in his careful ad-
vance the lava blocks were lower now he
was well up on the side of the low ridge
the air was cooler jim had to crawl part
of the time to keep cover he was think-
ing if i can only get into pistol range be-
fore that crazy fire priest sees me or that
white man with the rifle either

  then abruptly it happened jim made a
turn in the trail both his guns in their hol-
sters fifty feet away the german tourist
who had been at the convention at stanley-
ville hurried toward him holding a high
powered rifle with a telescopic sight in
both hands

  surprise was complete and disconcert-
ing for both of them kurt von sterns
ridiculous monocle dropped from his eye
jim was completely astounded to find out
that this smooth suave seemingly intelli-
gent gentleman was the fiend who was hir-
ing the akesi killers jim snapped out of
his spell of disconcerting surprise first
went for his automatics

  von stern cursing luridly in his startled
surprise dove behind a block of lava sent
a shot from his rifle at jim his bullet
went wild
three lions teeth



  what have you done with helen white
you damned murderer jim yelled
where is she itll do you no good to hide
her when i blast your guts out itll do
you no good to hide her where is she

  hell with you swine i know where she
is but youll never find her    alive
youll never find her von stern yelled
and when my akesi soldiers have killed
all of you miserable ignorant swine-fools
who think you know how to grow coffee
then i will be emperor of a big powerful
coffee empire

  then suddenly von stern leaped out
from behind the block of lava fired a quick
shot in his excitement he missed again
he jerked the rifle up snapped the bolt
action lock back and forward started to
turn the muzzle on jim and at that in-
stant a steel jacketed forty-five slug hit the
lock of his rifle in front of kurt von
sterns chest completed shattering it

  one quick glance and von stern knew
flung the rifle from him and before jim
could fire again darted into a lava crevasse
and ran like a hare he was over the top
of the low ridge and off down a jungle trail
beyond before jim ford tired from his
long trek of that morning could overtake
him but jim kept doggedly after the man
following sign persistently he was cer-
tain now that von stern would lead him
to helen

  nine oclock came and passed and with-
out pausing for rest jim ate what re-
mained of the cooked meat and manioc that
he carried in a small knapsack as a sort of
breakfast-lunch sign of the murderer that
he chased was plain once he caught a brief
glimpse of him through the jungle as he
hurried desperately on

  then a strange sound came to jim
fords ears a sound that he couldnt place
but as he approached an open space in the
tangle of growing things it came to him
it was the squealing and grunting of an
elephant

  this was elephant country all right
he wasnt surprised to hear one of the
beasts here but it sounded as if the ani-
mal were in great pain

  jim moved on more cautiously studying
every open space in the jungle carefully
before moving out into it he wanted no
part of an angry rogue elephant suffering
from some injury in that condition the

great beasts were more dangerous than
a lion

  then jim came to the edge of a large
grassy clear space with just a few small
trees scattered in it half way across fol-
lowing a game trail he saw kurt von
stern staggering along apparently nearly
spent too tired to try to break trail through
the jungle to one side or the other out of
sight of his pursuer

  but what caught jims eyes with a com-
plete and horrified fascination was a big
bull elephant rocking from side to side
near the farther edge of the clearing he
was grunting squealing occasionally blast-
ing a short agonized scream a closer look
showed that he had only one tusk the left
one the other had been broken off short
maybe in a fight over some female the
base of the right tusk stuck out of an im-
mense swelling was dripping with pus
the animal was literally insane with his
suffering

  a man who had lived in africa at all
who knew anything about them would go
to any lengths to keep out of sight and
scent of an elephant in the terrible condi-
tion that this bull was in but the only
elephants that von stern had ever seen
probably had been in a zoo he went care-
fully on toward the safety of the jungle
relying on the well known poor sight of
an elephant to escape detection

then suddenly everything changed
the great animal had been swinging
his trunk sampling the air trying to lo-
cate something-anything alive-that he
could vent his insane unreasoning rage on
for his suffering abruptly his trunk be-
came rigid steady he was drawing great
whistling breaths then he started to move
-short uncertain steps at first but
straight toward von stern the elephants
steps quickened he was suddenly moving
with the speed of a locomotive he was
sure of his prey now-had the scent clearfy

  kurt von stern screamed his panic
started to run the beast gained on him
rapidly the man was doomed he couldnt
hope to reach the jungle ahead of the
great bull

  jim emptied his automatic at the beast
he might as well have been firing at a ten
ton tank

  von stern dodged ran desperately foi


jungle stories

the trees but now the wounded elephant
was close could see him with his near
sighted little eyes he followed the man
like a hound after a rabbit

  then von stern was suddenly over-
whelmed he screamed just once and his
career of murder was finished irrevocably
he was rapidly being trampled into the
earth by the great pounding crushing pile
driver feet of the insane beast

  jim ford turned away sickened there
was nothing that he could do now his
mission had been accomplished completed
and he turned toward the crater to find
mkada and ng gamon and pick up the
rest of the chiefs warriors search out the
fire priest try to find helen white

  he had travelled only a few minutes on
the back trail when he saw chief mkada
come over a low ridge following sign at a
half run twenty big masai warriors were
strung out behind him and a very proud
pompous little wasuli hunch-back trotted
with the column the little man swaggered
extravagantly raced up to jim and at once
started to tell in his high pitched voice
every minute detail of the story of how he
had killed an akesi warrior down in the
land of fire his tones were loud so
mkadas warriors would miss no part of
his story ng gamon was a warrior now
he had killed his first man in battle

  jim cut ng gamon short to tell mkada
about von stern and to ask the chief
where would that fire temple be
mkada  see any sign 

  wah plenty sign sign point that
way he was holding his spear level
pointing

  von stern said he knew where helen
was jim told the chief he must have
her hidden in some jungle camp well find
some of his akesi-make them talk but i
want to check that temple first

  wah i make akesi talk plenty much
the big fellow said rolling the words with
relish but i think mebby-so fire priest
got memsahib maybe von stern make for
lie

  jim ford was off at a jog-trot mkada
and his warriors at his heels the trail
wound about among scattered lava boulders
on the slope climbing steadily jim was
coming to a turn in the winding trail near
the crest when a shrill terror filled scream
froze him in his tracks

  he paused only a moment then started
ahead at a fast run but reason caught up
with him short of the turn in the trail he
slowed mkada joined him they sneaked
forward quietly peered around the curve
and as they did so helen white screamed
again in that piercing terror filled pitch
jim  jim  save me  save me  save me
she shrieked

  the sight that met jim fords horror
stricken gaze as he peered around that turn
in the trail froze him he saw an old half
ruined temple its roof a low dome its
walls column after column of carved lava

  and inside the old sun god temple ex-
actly under the center of the dome roof
was a big waist high block of black lava
maybe ten feet long by five feet wide
helen white flat on her back was bound
to the top of this sacrificial stone by ankles
and wrists she was motionless-evidently
in a faint

  standing on a low platform on the far
side of the block was a giant black in a
flowing white robe he held a long wide
gleaming knife in both hands high above
the fainting form of the girl below him

  the priests head was tilted far back and
his lips moved in a slow mumble of sound
monotonous even toned deep

  before he could check himself jim ford
went at a fast run around the turn and as
he did so twelve akesi warriors swarmed
at him with shrill war yells from his left
plainly they had been spectators at the
sacrificial ceremonies

  the priest came out of his prayer-
trance ran toward jim shouting orders to
his akesi warriors in a deep bellowing
bass swinging that gleaming big knife

  jim leaped to his right put his back
against the wall blasted steady fire at the
savages a thrown spear gashed the flesh
over his ribs on his left side he could feel
blood running down his leg a thrown dag-
ger struck him a glancing blow on the
head staggering him for a moment he
was working his automatics steadily men
were falling before the steel jacketed slugs
and at that instant chief mkada and his
giant masai came around the turn rushed
the akesi immediately half a dozen dog-
fights commenced every warrior in the
temple court yard was screeching his war
yell the uproar racket was terrific

  suddenly the priests deep bellowing
three lions teeth



bass ceased jim leaped back looked for
him he was crouching low moving stealth-
ily toward helen his big sacrificial knife
raised he was in a direct line between jim
and the girl

  jim ford steadied his hand with a
mighty effort held his breath lined his
sights squeezed the trigger with a slow
steady pressure

  the forty-five whacked out its flat re-
port and the priest of the sun god stag-
gered he was hit falling practically dead
on his feet he flung an agonized glare
over his shoulder at jim and weaved on
toward the helpless fainting girl on the
sacrificial stone the big gleaming blade
was still raised high still ready to send
helen whites soul to his sun god fa-
natical strength held him up drove him on
he was a long stride from helen then
he stumbled fell limply motionless

  jim looked around quickly and was just
in time to see chief mkada and his giant
masai fighting men in full pursuit of the
last of the akesi he wheeled toward
helen once more    and beheld a sight
that momentarily froze him with horror

  the priest to the sun god was dragging
himself up the side of the sacrificial stone
gripping its blood stained edge with both
straining hands his big knife was clenched
between his jaws his head was rolling
back on his shoulders he was throwing
every remaining ounce of the strength of
his great body into one final desperate
effort to finish his work drive that gleam-
ing blade into helen whites heart

  as jim ford leaped forward to make
his aim doubly certain the girl raised her
head her horror-filled eyes were within
an arms length of the sun god priests
contorted face

  a high wild scream came from helens
lips she threw herself half over on her
side away from the giant black straining
at her bonds frantically

  the priest surged erect held himself up
with one hand on the great stone swaying
dizzily reached for his knife

  then a stream of steel-jacketed slugs
poured from jim fords automatic pistols
and their mighty impact literally flung the
great black to the ground this time he did
not rise again

  jim ford snatched up the fallen priests
sacrificial knife quickly slashed the leopard
skin strips that bound helen whites
wrists and ankles to the big blood stained
block of stone lifted her in his arms and
ran outside the temple with her

helen clung to him desperately she
was shaken nerve wracked almost in
tears with relief at the sight of jim ford
her rescuer the knowledge of her safety
at last

  oh jim she murmured i thought i
was going to die and never see you again
that big half-crazed savage he was so
cruel so cold  

  jim pointed down the slope where the
chief and his warriors tramped back up
the hill their work done look helen
he said its good old chief mkada
everything will be all right now and
when we get back we can go over to niy
plantation to live-that is as soon as the
parson in stanleyville has married us

  the girl looked up at him smiled a brief
smile it is you who has made everything
-almost everything-all right jim she
said quietly but poor mother and dad

  she was unable to go on she buried
her face in jims shoulders

  then abruptly she stood away from him
wiped her eyes took a long quivering
breath her sobbing ceased her chin came
up and a brave smile spread over her face
forgive me jim dear she said quietly
im afraid youll think im an awful
sissy and im not a sissy im not

of fear

by edgar wallace

here is a strange and thrilling story of
weird voodoo by one of the most popu-
lar jungle writers of all time

all this happened in the

interim between excellencies or it
could hardly have happened at all

his excellency the retiring administra-
tor of the reserved territories had de-
parted amidst the banging of guns and
the playing of the national anthem by a
small band of near-white musicians all
of whom and especially the cornet had a
tendency to play flat the new excel-
lency was enduring the agony of gout
at his house in budleigh salterton in dev-
on and his departure from home was in-
definitely postponed

a change of administration made little
or no difference to the people of the big
river and captain hamilton of the kings

houssas for one was hardly conscious of agasaka she looked into the dark depths of
the lacuna as he strode savagely towards	mens souls

jungle stories

the hut which housed his youthful second
in command

  kicking open the door of lieutenant
tibbettss hut he stepped in and snorted
his disgust mr tibbetts whose other
name was bones lay face upwards on the
top of his bed and he was arrayed in a
costume beyond forgiveness for not solo-
mon in all his glory wore purple pajamas
with alternate green and ochre stripes

  hamilton flung down upon the table the
paper he had been carrying as bones open-
ed one eye

   morning sir he said slightly dazed
is it still raining

   morning snapped hamilton it is
within an hour of dinner and ive some-
thing to say to you bones

  bones relapsed into slumber

  wake up and hide your hideous feet
the eyelids of the sleeper fluttered he
murmured something about not seeing the
point-he had at least seen the news-
paper and recognized the gothic title-
piece

  the point is bones said hamilton
awfully nobody knows better than you
that it is an offence for any officer to
write to the newspapers on any subject
this--he smacked the folded newspaper
on the table-this is an outrage 

  surrey star and middlesex plain
dealer sir murmured bones his eyes
closed a picture of patience forebearance
and resignation

  the point is this hamilton pushed
his junior off the bed you really must
not write political articles suggesting that
the secretary of state should come and
see with his own eyes  - hamilton
sought for the offending paragraph and
read it- f the work that is being car-
ried out by young officers unknown and
unhonoured-of all the rubbish

it is doubtful whether mr nickerson
haben had even heard of the existence
of that organ of public conscience the
surrey star and middlesex plain dealer
he was not the type of man who gave a
thought to any newspaper that had a cir-
culation of less than half a million

  and yet the appearance of this literary
effort of bones coincided with a peculiar
moment of crisis in his life and the sequel
almost excused the subsequent jubilation

of the surrey star and went far to con-
solidate the editors claim that what the
star thinks to-day the government does
to-morrow

  for nickerson haben went almost at
once to examine the territories with his
own eyes he was in the middle thirties
and had the globe at his feet how this
came to be the case nobody troubled to
consider

  a narrow-chested and pallid man with
heavy raven hair one lock of which hung
over his forehead in moments of oratori-
cal excess he was deep-eyed thin-lipped
hollow-faced and had hands white and
long nickerson was swept into the house
of commons in a whirlwind of oratory
that blew down a phalanx of sober men
and conservative citizens which stood be-
tween

  the new government made him an
under-secretary first of agriculture then
of foreign affairs he had married the
widow of cornelius beit an american
lady fifteen years his senior-a clever
woman with a violent temper and a com-
plete knowledge of men their home life
though it was lived at carlton house ter-
race was not happy she knew him rather
too well his own temper was none of the
sweetest he had all the arrogance of a
self-made man who had completed the
process just a little too young she once
told a near friend that nickerson had a
streak of commonness which she found it
difficult to endure and there was even
talk of a divorce

  that was just before her operation for
appendicitis the best surgeon in england
performed her recovery was never in
doubt nickerson under the spell of her
recovery went down to the house and de-
livered the best speech of his life on the
subject of baluchistan

  three days later she was dead-there
had occurred one of those curious relapses
which are so inexplicable to the layman
so dreaded by the medical profession

  haben was like a man stunned those
who hated him-many-wondered what he
would do now with the principal source of
income departed they had time for no
further than a brief speculation the matter
being decided when the will was read
leaving him everything-except for a leg-
acy to a maid
the magic of fear

                           



  this tragedy occurred between excel-
lencies an opportunity seized upon by a
sympathetic chief nickerson haben went
out on the first african mail-boat to com-
bine business with recreation to find
flaws and forgetfulness

linked very closely with the life and
fate of mr nickerson haben under-
secretary of state was that of agasaka
the chimbiri woman mr haben was
dressed by the best tailor in savile row
agasaka wore no clothes at all except for
the kilt of dried grass which hung from
her beautiful waist

  a tall maiden very slim of body and
very grave of eyes no lover of any man
having a great love of something more im-
ponderable than man terribly wise too
in ways of ghosts and devils straight-
backed small-breasted beloved of children
so strong in the arm and skilled in her
strength that she could put a spear be-
yond the range of young mens throw-
this was agasaka the chimbiri woman
daughter of nkma-nkimi the dead wood-
man

  she was elderly for a virgin being
seventeen had been wooed by men in
their every mood had kindness for all
generosity for none

  she lived with her brother msuru the
hunting man and his women hated her
for she never spoke a lie and was frank
to her elderly brother on the matter of
their numerous lovers they would have
beaten her but that they knew the strength
of her throwing arm where hands did not
dare tongues were more reckless but none
of their mud stuck few men were so poor
in mind that they would admit others had
succeeded where they had failed

  she had lived for many years with her
father in the deep of the forest in the
abiding place of mshimba mshamba the
fearfully boisterous devil who tears up
trees with each hand whilst his mouth
drips molten fire and other mighty ones
dwelt near by nguro the headless dog
and chikalaka-mbofunga the eater of
moons-indeed all except the fire lizard
whose eyes talk death and nkema had
taught her the mysteries of life and the
beginning of life and the ground where
life is sown she knew men in their raw-
ness and in their strength nkema taught

her the way in which she might be more
wonderful than any other woman the
magic handed down from mouth to mouth
-the magic which was old when they laid
the first deep stones of the pyramids 

  men were afraid of her even oboro
the witch-doctor avoided her

  for this was her strangest magic that
she had the power to bring before the
eyes of men and women that which they
desired least to see

  once a small chief stalked her by the
river path where the grass is chin-high
having certain plans with her and at the
right and lonely moment he slipped from
cover dropping his spears in the grass
and caught her by the arms so that strong
as she was she could not move

  agasaka he said i have a hut in
this forest that has never heard a womans
voice-

  he got so far and then over her silken
shoulder he saw three black leopards
walking flank by flank along the narrow
path their heads hung low their golden
eyes shone hungrily

  in an instant he released her and fled
to his spears

  when he turned again leopards and
woman were gone

  aliki the huntsman of her village
neither feared nor cared for he was
familiar with magics of all kinds and often
walked in the woods communing with
devils one night he saw a vision in the
fire a great red lizard that blinked its
heavy eyelids aliki looked round his famj
ily circle in a cold-blooded search for a
victim calichi the fire-lizard is the most-
benevolent of devils and will accept a
deputy for the man or woman to whom
with its red and blinking eyes it has
given its warning of death

  this aliki saw his three wives and his
father and an uncle who had come many
days journey on a hunting trip and none
of these save the youngest wife was well
enough favoured for the purpose calichi
is a fastidious devil nothing short of the
best and the most beautiful will please him
beyond the group sitting about the red
fire and eating from the big pot that stood
in the embers were other groups the
village street of chimbiri-isisi runs from
the forest to the river a broad avenue
fringed with huts and before each hut


jungle stories

burnt a fire and about each fire squatted
the men and women of the house

  dark had come above the tall gum
trees the sky was encrusted with bright
stars that winked and blinked as calichi
but more rapidly

  aliki saw the stars and rubbed his palms
in the dust for luck and at that moment
into his vision came the second wife of his
neighbour a tall woman of eighteen a
nymph carved in mahogany straight and
supple of back naked to the waistline of
her grass skirt and aliki knew that he
had found a proper substitute and said her
name under his breath as he caught the
lizards eyes thereupon the beast faded
and died away and aliki knew that the
fire-god approved his choice

later that night when loka the wife
of msuru the huntsman went down
to the river to draw water for the first
wifes needs aliki intercepted her

  there is nobody so beautiful as you
loka he said for you have the legs
of a lion and the throat of a young deer

  he enumerated other physical perfec-
tions and loka laughed and listened she
had quarrelled that day with the first wife
of her husband and msuru had beaten
her she was terribly receptive to flattery
and ripe for such adventure as women en-
joy

  have you no wives aliki  she asked
pleased now i will give you agasaka
the sister of-my husband who is very
beautiful and has never touched the shoul-
der of a man this she said in spite for
she hated agasaka and it is a way of
women to praise to strangers the quali-
ties of the sisters they loathe

  as to agasaka-and wives-he made
a gesture of contempt-there is no such
wife as you not even in the hut of the
old king beyond the mountains which are
the end of the world said aliki and
loka laughed again

  now i know that you are mad as
msuru says also that you see strange
sights which are not there to see she
said in her deep gurgling voice and
not msuru alone but all men say that
you have the sickness mongo

  it was true that aliki was sick and had
shooting pains in his head he saw other
things than lizards

  msuru is an old man and a fool he
said i have a ju-ju who gives me eyes
to see wonders come with me into the
forest loka and i will tell you magic and
give you love such as an old man cannot
give

  she put down her gourd hiding it in a
patch of elephant grass near the rivers
edge and walked behind him into the
forest there eventually he killed her
and he lit a fire and saw the lizard who
seemed satisfied aliki washed himself in
the river and went back to his hut and to
sleep

  when he awoke in the morning he was
sorry he had killed loka for of all the
women in the world she had been most
beautiful in his eyes the village was half
empty for lokas gourd had been found
and trackers had gone into the woods
searching for her her they found but
nobody had seen her walking to death
some people thought she had been taken
by ochori fishermen others favoured a
devil notorious for his amorous tricks
they brought the body back along the
village street and all the married women
made skirts of green leaves and stamped
the death dance singing strangely

  aliki squatting before his fire watched
the procession with incurious eyes he was
sorry he had killed the thing that was
carried shoulder high and dropping his
gaze to the dull fire was even more sorry
for the hot lizard was leering up at him
his bulging eyelids winking at a great rate

  so he had taken the wrong sacrifice

  his eyes rose rested on the slim figure
of a woman one hand gripping the door-
post of her brothers hut and there came
to aliki a tremendous conviction

  the lizard had vanished from the heart
of the fire when he looked down

  no time was to be lost he rose and
went towards the virgin of chimbiri

  i see you agasaka he said now
this is a terrible shame to come to your
brothers house for men say that this
woman loka had a lover who killed her

  she turned her big eyes slowly towards
him they were brown and filled with a
marvellous luminosity that seemed to
quiver as she looked

  loka died because she was a fool
she said but he who killed her was a
bigger one her pain is past his to come
the magic of fear



soon sandi wialaka will come the brown
butcher bird and he will pick the eyes of
the man who did this thing

  aliki hated her but he was clever to
nod his agreement

  i am wise agasaka he said i see
wonders which no man sees now before
sandi comes with his soldiers i will show
you a magic that will bring this wicked man
to the door of your brothers hut when the
moon is so and the river is so

  her grave eyes were on his the sound
of the singing women was a drone of
sound at the far end of the village a
dog barked wheezily in the dark of the
hut and all faces were turned towards
the river where the body was being laid
in a canoe before it was ferried to the
little middle island where the dead lie in
their shallow graves

  let us go she said and walked be-
hind him through an uneven field of
maize gained the shelter of the wood
behind the village and by awkward paths
reached the outliers of the forest where
there was no maize for this place was too
sad for the weaver birds and too near to
the habitation of man for the little mon-
keys who have white beards still he
walked on until they made a patch of
yellow flowers growing in a clearing here
the trees were very high and ten men
might have stood on one anothers heads
against the smooth boles and the topmost
alone could have touched the lowermost
branch 

he stopped and turned at that second
came an uneasy stirring of the tree
tops a cold wind

  let us sit down he said first i
will talk to you of women who loved me
and of how i would not walk before them
because of my great thoughts for you
then we will be lovers-

  there is no magic in that aliki she
said and he saw that she was against him
and lifted his spear

  you die as loka died because of the
word which the lizard of fire brought to
me he said and his shoulder hunched
back for the throw

  i am loka said the girl and he
looked and his jaw dropped for she was
truly loka the woman he had killed-

-jungle stories-spring

loka with her sly eyes and long fingers
and she had lokas way of putting a red
flower behind her ear and lokas long
satiny legs

  oh ko he said in distress and drop-
ped his spear

  agasaka bent in the middle and picked
it up and in that moment became herself
again there was no flower and her fingers
were shorter and where the sly smile had
been was the gravity of death

  this is my magic she said now
walk before me aliki killer of loka for
i am not made for love but for strange
power

 without a word the bemused man
walked back the way he had come and
agasaka followed and following felt the
edge of the spears broad blade though
she touched lightly there was a line of
blood on her thumb where blade and skin
had met the wood was growing dark
the wind was alternately a shriek and a
whimper of sound

  near the pool at the edge of the forest
she swung the spear backward over her
left shoulder as a cavalry soldier would
swing his sword and he half turned at
the sound of the whistle it made 

  the first wife of her brother was by
the pool gathering manioc root from a
place where it had been left to soak-
the head of aliki fell at her feet as the
first flash of lightning lit the gloom of the
world

the sun was four hours old when
a river gunboat a white and glittering
thing came round the bluff which is called
the fish because of its shape the black
waters of the river were piled up around
its bows a glassy hillock of water tinged
red at its edges for the zaire was driving
against a six-knot current

  sanders stood by the steersman a slim
and dapper figure in spotless white his
pith helmet at a rakish angle

  loba kolo ka a fathom of water
by the mercy of god

  the sleepy-eyed boy sitting in the bow
of the boat drew up his wet sounding-rod

  sanders eyes sought the river-side path
he saw eight men walking two and two
and they carried on their shoulders a
trussed figure

  o men said sanders softly who


jungle stories

are you that you put the ghost mark on
this womans face

  por the face of their passenger was
daubed white with clay none spoke he
saw their toes wriggling all save those of
one man and him he addressed

  msuru son of nkema what woman
is this

  msuru cleared his throat

  lord this woman is the daughter of
my own mother she killed aliki also she
killed first my wife loka

  who saw this 

  master my first wife who is a true
woman to me since her lover was drowned
she saw the head of aliki fall also she
heard agasaka say go man where i sent
loka as you know best who saw me slay
her 

  sanders was not impressed

  let loose this woman that she may
stand in my eyes he said and they un-
tied the girl and by his order wiped the
joke of death from her face

  tell me said sanders

  she spoke very simply and her story
was good yet-

  bring me the woman who heard her
say these evil things

  the wife was found in the tail of the
procession and came forward frightened-
for the cold eyes of sanders were un-
nerving but she was voluble when she
had discovered her voice

  agasaka the slim woman stood grave
unconscious of shame-the grass girdle
had gone and she was as her mother had
first seen her presently the first wife
came to the end of her story

  sandi this is the truth and if i speak
a lie may the long ones take me to the
bottom of the river and feed me to the
snakes

  sanders watching her saw the brown
skin go dull and gray saw the mouth
open in shocking fear

  what he did not see was the long one
-the yellow crocodile that was creeping
through the grass towards the perjurer
his little eyes gleaming his wet mouth
open to show the cruel white spikes of
teeth

  only the first wife of msuru saw this
and fell screaming and writhing at her
husbands feet clasping his knees

  sanders said nothing but heard much

that was in contradiction of the earlier
story

  come with me agasaka to my fine
ship he said for he knew that trouble
might follow if the girl stayed with her
people wars have started for less cause

  he took her to the zaire she followed
meekly at his heels though meekness was
not in her

the zaire was steaming for home the
next day when he sent for abiboo his
orderly

  bring me this woman of chimbiri
he said and they brought her from the
little store-cabin where she was both guest
and prisoner

  they tell me you have strange magic
agasaka he said

  lord it is true said agasaka these
things my father taught me as his father
taught him for lord he was the son
of mkufusu the son of bonfongu-mlini
the son of nsambi 

  she recited thirty generations before he
stopped her-roughly four hundred years
even sanders was staggered though he
had once met an old man of the ngombi
who told him intimate details about a man
who had lived in the days of saladin

 show me your magic woman he
said and to his surprise she shook her
head

  lord this one magic only comes when
i am afraid

  sanders dropped his hand to his brown-
ing and half drew it from its leather
holster

  he was sitting under an awning spread
over the bridge the steersman was at the
wheel in the bow the kano boy with his
long sounding-rod purposely he did not
look at the woman fixing his eyes on the
steersmans back

  his hand had scarcely closed on the
brown grip when almost at his feet he
saw the one thing in all the world that he
loathed-an english puff adder mottled
and swollen its head thrown back to strike

  twice his pistol banged-the steersman
skipped to cover with a yell and left the
zaire yawing in the strong current

  there was nothing-nothing but two
little holes in the deck so close together
that they overlapped sanders sprang to
the wheel and straightened the boat and
the magic of fear



then when the steersman had been called
back and the sounding boy retrieved
from the cover of the wood pile where
he crouched and trembled sanders re-
turned to his chair waving away abiboo
who had arrived rifle in hand to the
rescue of his master

  woman said sanders quietly you
may go back to your little house

  and agasaka went without the evi-
dence of triumph a lesser woman might
have felt he had not looked at her-
there was no mesmerism here

  he stooped down and examined the
bullet holes too troubled to feel foolish

  that afternoon he sent for her again
and gave her chocolate to eat talking
of her father she was sitting on the
deck at his feet and once when he
thought he had gained her confidence
he dropped his hand lightly on her head
as he had dropped his hand on so many
young heads

  the puff adder was there-within strik-
ing distance his spade head thrown back
his coils rigid

  sanders stared at the thing and did
not move his hand and then through
the shining body he saw the deck planks
and the soft bitumen where plank joined
plank and then the viper vanished

  you do not fear he asked quietly

  lord a little but now i do not fear
for i know that ou would not hurt
women

  the zaire with its strange passenger
came alongside the residency wharf two
hours before sundown on the third day

hes pure swine said hamilton
nothing is good enough for him
he raised hell when he found you werent
here to meet him bones molified him a
little the silly ass had a guard of honour
drawn up on the beach

  all this between wharf and residency
garden a figure in white stretched lan-
guidly in a deep chair turned his head
but did not trouble to rise still less was
he inclined to exchange the cool of the
broad veranda for the furnace of space
open to a red-hot sun

  sanders saw a white face that looked
oddly dirty in contrast with the spotless
purity of a duck jacket two deep sus-
picious eyes a long untidy wisp of hair

lying lankly on a high forehead-a pink
almost bloodless mouth

  youre sanders

  mr haben looked up at the trim figure

  i am the commissioner sir said
sanders

  why werent you here to meet me
you knew that i was due

  sanders was more shocked than net-
tled by the tone a coarse word in the
mouth of a woman would have produced
the same effect

  do you hear me sir the man on
the chair sat up impatiently

  hamilton standing by was near to
kicking him off the step

  i heard you i was on a visit to the
chimbiri country no notice of your
arrival or your pending arrival was re-
ceived

  sanders spoke very carefully he was
staring down at the scowling haben

  mr haben had it on the tip of his
tongue to give him the lie there was
as the late mrs haben had said a streak
of commonness in him but there was a
broader streak of discretion the gun
still hung at the commissioners hip the
gripwas shiny with use

 hm said mr under-secretary
haben and allowed himself to relax in
his chair

  he was clever enough sanders found
knew the inside story of the territories
was keen for information he thought
the country was not well run the system
was wrong the taxes fell short of the
highest possible index in all ways his
attitude was antagonistic commissioners
were lazy people intent on having a good
time and their shooting sanders who
had never shot a wild beast in his life
save for the pot or to rid himself of
a pressing danger said nothing

  a thoroughly nasty fellow said ham-
ilton

  at dinner haben touched the zenith
of his boorishntess the dinner was bad
he hated palm-nut chop sweet potatoes
made him ill the chicken was tough the
coffee vile happily he had brought his
own cigars

  only sanders showed no sign of an-
noyance not a muscle of his face moved
when mr nickerson haben made the
most unforgivable of all suggestions he


jungle stories

did this out of sheer ignorance and be-
cause of that streak of commonness which
was his very own

  a native woman is a native woman
said sanders quietly happily i have
only had gentlemen under my control and
that complication has never arisen

  mr haben smiled sceptically he was
sourest when he smiled

  very noble he said dryly and yet
one has heard of such things happening
hamilton was white with rage bones
stared open-mouthed like a boy who only
dimly understood the pale man asked a
question and to the amazement of the
others sanders nodded

  yes i brought a girl down from
chimbiri he said she is at present in
the houssa lines with the wife of sergeant
abiboo i hardly know what to do with
her

  i suppose not more dryly yet a
prisoner i suppose

  n-no - sanders hesitated - seemed
confused in habens eyes she has a pe-
culiar brand of magic which rather con-
founds me-

  here mr nickerson haben laughed
that stuff he said contemptuously
let me see your magician

  bones was sent to fetch her-he swore
loudly all the way across the dark square

  that is what we complain about said
mr haben in the time of waiting you
fellows are in the country so long that you
get niggerized sanders winced nig-
ger is a word you do not use in africa
you absorb their philosophies and super-
stitions magic-good heavens

  he waggled his long head hopelessly
my poor wife believed in the same rub-
bish-she came from one of the southern
states-had a black mammy who did won-
derful things with chicken bones

  sanders had not credited him with a
wife when he learnt that the poor lady
had died he felt that worse things could
happen to a woman

  appendicitis-an operation    fool
of a doctor mr haben unbent so far as
to scatter these personal items as i said
before you people-hum 

  agasaka stood in the doorway mis-

sionary dressed as they say her figure
was concealed in a blue cotton cloth
wrapped and pinned about her to the height
of her breast

  this is the lady eh come here he
beckoned her and she came to him let
us see her magic    speak to her
sanders nodded

  this man wishes to see your magic
agasaka he is a great chief amongst my
people

  she did not answer

  not bad-looking said nickerson and
did a thing which amazed these men for
he rose and putting his hand under her
chin raised her face to his and there was
something in his queer hard eyes that she
read as we may read the printed word
the streak of commonness was abominably
broad and raw-edged

  youre not so bad for a nig 

  he dropped his hands suddenly they
saw his face pucker hideously he was
looking at a woman a handsome woman
with deep shadows under her eyes it was
the face he often saw and always tried to
forget a dead white face she wore a silk
nightdress rather high to the throat  
and she spoke

  wont you wait until the nurse comes
back nick i dont think i ought to drink
ice-water-the doctor says-

  damn the doctor said nickerson
haben between his teeth and the three
men heard him saw his hand go up hold-
ing an imaginary glass saw his eyes fall
to the level of an imaginary pillow

  im sick of you-sick of you make a
new will eh  like hell

  he stared and stared and then slowly
turned his drawn face to sanders

  my wife-he pointed to space and
mumbled the words-i-i killed her-
and then he realized that he was nick-
erson haben under-secretary of state
and these were three very unimportant of-
ficials-and a black woman who was re-
garding him gravely but this discovery of
his was just the flash of a second too late

  go to your room sir said sanders
and spent the greater part of the night
composing a letter to the foreign secre-
tary

the sorcerer of
kambara

 by dan cushman

 could a trader-tramp like johnny starr save a queen like paulette payan
 from the curse of the black sorcerer maybe he could-when the stakes

   were shebas fortunes

the sun was red as a kaffir
orange as it sank through smoke
haze which had drifted north on the
dry-season wind from angola there was
a tiny clearing a footpath sloping sharply
to a river bank johnny starr issued a
command to his twelve kama porters and
they came wearily to a stop this was
bonde river a northward-flowing tribu-
tary of the congo the evening goal he
had set for his safari

  johnny starrs feet had been troubling
him since mid-morning but there was no
sign of fatigue on his thin mahogany-


tanned face as he stood idly slapping one
leg with his fly-whisk

  bwana mkubwa intoned the ancient
nefunta his capita the cloth house
bwana

  johnny starr walked to one side and
then to the other twanging the taut tent
cords with his thumb he indicated satis-
faction with a crisp jerk of his head and
went inside only then seated on a blanket
roll beyond sight of his blacks did his face
show the suffering that his feet had caused
him

  he pulled off his antelope hide veldt-



jungle stories

schoen and examined each large toe chig-
gers had found their way beneath the nails
they had deposited their egg-sacs and now
the eggs had hatched and were itching
him like the very devil

  he scraped each toe carefully smeared
with merthiolate and rubbed his feet with
tiger balm he felt better he stretched
his feet toward the tent flap rolled a
cigarette of native leaf adding a pinch of
bangh as an evening luxury and smoked
slowly

  johnny starr was thirty or thirty-five
its hard to guess a mans age after hes
been burned and dehydrated by the sun
and quinine of two tropical continents he
was medium in height slim but with a
springsteel quality that indicated strength
his teeth were strong and white a scar
was partially hidden by a close moustache

  he inhaled keeping the smoke down a
long time to get all the comforting bangh
out of it twenty or thirty paces away he
could see his kama tribesmen squatting
on their elongated heelbones around a
smoky fire where a kettle of mealie-meal
was bubbling beyond them through an
opening in the jungle the low and green-
ish bonde moved among the brace roots
of underwashed trees at some distance
perhaps a half-dozen kilometers he could
hear the wavering irregular sound of a
tree-trunk drum

  he noticed that his porters had ceased
watching their mealie-meal they were
rigid and large eyed listening after three
or four minutes the drum became silent
he crawled through the tent flap and
asked

  what were the words of the drum

  there was a lengthy silence before ne-
funta the capito answered it was the
juma tongue and we did not understand
all of it bwana

  what were its words

  a quality in starrs voice made nefunta
hurry to say a woman escaped the king
of lilula village will pay ten arms lengths
of copper wire for her capture

  a slave woman

  a bondele woman the capito an-
swered in awed tones

  starr twisted hie lips-the drums

said that

  yes bwfana

  starr laughed and turned abruptly

striding back to the tent the idea of a
lilua king offering a reward for a white
woman was too ridiculous for considera-
tion

  he awoke next morning before sunup
with mist hanging over the river he
shaved and wiped his face hurriedly with
a damp towel when he heard the natives
jabbering excitedly he strode over in
time to see someone coming up the bank
from a small dugout canoe

  starr drew up with abrupt surprise on
seeing it was a white woman

  she saw starr at the same second she
turned as though to run a canvas-wrapped
package clutched tightly to her breast
then she checked herself and stood quite
still her eyes very large and dark

  youre just in time for breakfast
starr said pretending to notice nothing
unusual about her arrival

  youre-from parhana she asked

 from kamakama

  oh

she walked forward then her eyes
quickly roving the camp she was no
older than twenty-one small extremely
slim waisted her complexion was brown-
ed rather than the sallow hue which most
white women assume in the tropics she
had tried to stuff her hair beneath a terai
sunhat but most of it had escaped and
hung in wavy dark masses to her shoul-
ders she wore a torn and soiled brown
shirt khaki-shorts and knee-length stock-
ings she still clasped the small canvas-
wrapped package closely

  you wont let them find me she
whispered

  youre running from something
starr asked and when she did not answer
he raised his voice who are you running
from

  she answered sounding short of breath
i cant stop here theyre too close i
dont know how far maybe only a couple
of kilometers i havent slept for two
nights

  whos chasing you

  the tribesmen from kambara they
killed my father and sister he was mis-
sionary there-

  he seized her shoulders and shook her
trying to snap the delirium that seemed
to be holding her
the sorcerer of kambara



  youre trying to tell me that the na-
tives have attacked kambara

  she nodded it was because of the
fever the spirillum six of them died
three or four others went blind half
the village was down father did what
he could they had a sorcerers dance
funza he was the witch doctor he al-
ways hated us he said i was the sorcer-
ess he said id brought the spirillum
that id put a curse on them they believed
him they thought theyd have to kill me
father tried to fight them off they killed
him i saw them kill him she com-
menced to sob

  he shook her get hold of yourself
they cant be after you now they
wouldnt follow you here from kambara
he was lying across the little cobble
path i dont remember what i did-how
i escaped the house i hid in some jasmine
bushes they were all around but they
couldnt find me then i crawled to the
river and found a canoe after dark i
floated downstream they had set fire to
all the mission buildings

  starr went inside the ten opened the
uniform can and uncorked a last precious
bottle of scotch he held it to her lips
and she took a couple of gulps before
realizing what it was it strangled her
first and then steadied her

starr turned on nefunta and demanded
what else did those talking drums say
they say king of lilula village he pay
ten lengths of copper wire for bondele
woman

  you already told me that what else
did it say

  only that bwana

  johnny starr stood with hands on hips
muscles knotted at the sides of his jaw
his face looked hollow beneath his prom-
inent cheekbones

  he kept opening and closing his hands
rapidly

  when was it he asked the girl

  she moved sharply realizing he was
speaking to her night before last
youve been traveling two nights and
a day without eating or sleeping

  she nodded

  youd have to youve covered lots of
ground what makes you think theyre
still following

  she didnt answer his question instead

she said you wont let them find me
here you-

   of course not youll have to rest ill
fix you some breakfast

  he led her to the tent she crept
through the flap and sat on the blankets
which were still spread inside starr
opened a can of bully-beef and brewed
strong tea his natives finished with
fingering thick scalding mealie-meal into
their mouths stood at a distance watching
him

  breakfast was ready but she seemed
to be sleeping and he did not disturb her

  the sun was breaking through purplish
mists he twisted a cigarette from vile
native leaf and puffed it slowly

  a native spoke in startled alarm and
pointed downstream with an elongated low-
er lip a dugout canoe had swung into
sight and was pushing swiftly with a
rhythmic flash of paddles

  starr spun toward the tent and saw
that the girl had taken alarm at the natives
words and was running toward him the
canvas-wrapped package was still in her
arms

  he seized her wrist to stop her from
escaping into the jungle

  get hold of yourself girl

  she forced herself to stand still

  he asked are those the ones who were
chasing you 

  she nodded but there are more three
or four canoes

  starr went to the tent lifted a heavy
bolt action express rifle from its scabbard
snapped off the safety he stood on a high
shoulder of the bank appraising the guns
balance then with a practiced movement
tossed it to his shoulder took quick aim
and pulled the trigger

  the canoe was a good three hundred
meters off but he could see the slit of
water where the  magnum slug cut
barely right of the canoes prow the
paddles instantly stopped their flashing and
the canoe hung to the flat still surface
of the river he fired again and the
paddles dug in desperately all rhythm
gone from their movements the canoe
swung broadside to him as it disappeared
among vine-dripping trees along the jungle
shore there were seven or eight men in
it-and the one in the prow wore a sun
helmet


jungle stories

  he strode back to camp ordering his
porters into action

  youll go on without me he said to
nefunta all except for ngando and
bobiste he scribbled a note as he talked
tearing it from his notebook and handing
it to the capito give this to herr glenn-
thier at ste helene hell pay you and
store the packages wait for me one
week if i dont arrive return to your
people

  yes bwana mkubzvasaid nefunta
asking no question

  the girl had retreated a dozen steps
along the footpath anxious to be away
starr said

  theres no trail through the jungle
they can follow it would take them an
hour to chop their way along that shore
with bush knives

ngando and bobiste worked rapidly
making two packs of tent blankets
and provisions the others led by nefun-
ta had already shouldered their heavy
packages they set out at a swift half-
jog on the down-river footpath

  youre letting them go without you
the girl cried

  sure theyll probably decoy your
kambara natives into following that
ought to give us a bit of a start well
head up this footpath three or four kilos
and then cut over to kwilu the com-
missaire has his men in that country some-
where collecting the head tax and theyll
give you a safe passage back to lusambo

  she shook her head i cant go to
kwilu

 why

  i cant go to kwilu thats all-i
cant go there if you want i will go on
alone-

  he seized her wrist theres a whole
devil of a lot you havent bothered to
tell me

  i wont let you take me to kwilu

  all right where will you go

  to bande-moke

  bande-moke was a settlement lying three
or four days travel to the south almost
at the border of portuguese angola from
there it would only be a hundred and fifty
kilometers to the railhead at melange so
it wasnt an unreasonable destination

  how did you happen to pick bande

  my brother is there

  he looked into her eyes for a few
seconds then turned and made a signal to
his blackboys

  for an hour they traveled through deep
jungle then quite unexpectedly the heavy
forest ended and the path struck across
an apparently limitless expanse of savan-
nah the country was slightly rolling deep
in yellow grass here and there irregular
as blots of spilt ink lay dense areas of
thorn and woodland on a clear day one
could see the broken outline of the kama-
kama hills but this morning the horizon
was a void turned grayish by grassfires

  after many hours of blind travel
through the deep grass they reached the
little hoof-punched waterhole where the
safari had taken siesta the day before
starr looked at the girl she seemed more
rested than on her arrival that morning
so it had been fear rather than fatigue
bothering her

  well sleep a few hours he said i
dont think theres much danger of them
following us here he smiled with a slight
twist of his scarred upper lip not even
for all those armslengths of copper wire
that king was offering

  theyll still follow

  starr had long been used to two meals
a day so the absence of a lunch did not
occur to him he settled back shoulders
against a wild fig tree looking at the
girls face as she slept the canvas-wrap-
ped package was still in her arms he
kept thinking of the canoe that his rifle
bullets had chased into the bush he was
certain it had been a white man in its
prow

  he smoked-slept he awoke suddenly
the girl was standing looking down on
him

  feel better

  she nodded he crooked his thumb at
the canvas-wrapped package i see you
brought something from the mission

  she moved in a startled manner shifting
the package from one arm to the other

  its-something father didnt want lost
i knew hed want my brother to have it

i	went back and got it-before they burned
the mission

  he pretended to believe her is there
any reason a white man should be follow-
ing you 
the sorcerer of kambara



 why

  i was just wondering is there

  you saw mutanda sitting in that canoe
didnt you

  i dont know who is mutanda

  his father was a german trader he
always wears a sun helmet and white
shirt but hes sort of a fetish priest and
the worst of them

  her eyes were pleading for him to be-
lieve he asked what did you say your
fathers name was

  the-reverend payen im paulette
payen

  and youre sure you have a brother in
bande  its not quite the place a girl goes
to without someone waiting for her
yes my brother will be in bande-
moke

that evening they camped beside a
stream which cut deeply through a
considerable area of thorn there was no
apparent pursuit starr rolled up in a
blanket just outside the door of the tent
he awoke next morning before the sun
with a feeling that paulette had left dur-
ing the night hours he opened the tent
flap it was still dark inside but he heard
her sudden movement the soft sound of
blankets as she sat up

  what do you want she whispered

  i thought you were gone

  he stood up closing the flap the dim
pre-dawn light had filtered through the
tent leaving with him an impression of her
eyes-and of the package clasped tightly
to her breast

  he had opened the last can of bully-
beef the night before but there was still
plenty of the hard white-flour biscuits

  when they were eating breakfast he
said theres a kama village well reach
tonight it used to be a police post called
fort cachot it still has a trade post run
by a mulatto named leclerc we can get
supplies there unless youd rather not
why wouldnt i

  i dont know i just remembered that
you didnt care much about the idea of
going to ivwilu

  she munched a hard biscuit it took her
considerable time then she said you
think im lying dont you

  starr took some time too he rolled a
cigarette lighted it

  she demanded dont you

  why make me give you an answer
im taking you to bande isnt that
enough 

  she stood up he thought for a moment
she was going to weep she said im
sorry really im sorry i appreciate all
youre doing for me i thought you real-
ized i was telling the truth i dont blame
you for being suspicious but-

  dont carry it too far sister

  she stopped abruptly what do you
mean 

  just what i said dont carry it too
far otherwise ill take that package away
from you and find the real reason for
you going to bande

  youre joking

  he laughed cigarette smoke from his
lungs no im not joking im like
every other man i enjoy having a pretty
woman make a fool of me but i like
to let her know im wise to whats going
on

  youre american arent you

  i dont know what that has to do with
it but i am

  it just occurred to me the way you
talk

 youve been around americans
havent you youre flemish yourself but
youve been around americans thats
where you learned to speak english from
americans theres a difference in the
way an american and a bally bloody brit-
isher says things-

  what difference does it make

  did you have many americans around
your fathers mission

  she fumbled for an answer and when
none came anger burned through her i
could very easily learn to hate you

  starr threw his cigarette in the fire
i read a book one time oh dont look
at me like that it was a good many years
ago and i was down with the fever in
this book there was a girl a girl of
mystery like you i think she even looked
like you and she went for three hundred
and ninety nine pages hating a man from
his bootheels right up to the clay he
smeared on his helmet and do you know
what happened on page four hundred
she found out she was in love with him
and had been in love with him all the
time


jungle stories

  it wont happen in my case

  no well dont make too much of a
point of it before we get to bande

  just exactly what do you mean
this he seized her wrist as though
to pull her to him she was unexpectedly
strong she twisted away her hand going
beneath her loose khaki shirt he made no
movement to come after her so her hand
remained as it was

  he laughed and said in an easy voice
take it easy darling i just wondered
whether you did have a little flat auto-
matic hiding out come to think of it
you managed to stagger out of that flaming
mission house pretty well heeled didnt
you 

  youre suggesting that-

  im not suggesting a damned thing
ill say it right out i dont mind helping
little girls escape a bunch of natives on
the ju-ju kill thats free but if it turns
out that the little girl has a canvas package
filled with diamonds shes getting through
to angola without the slight formality of
paying the government tarriff thats a
steed of a different color in plain ameri-
can english which you seem to understand
like a switchboard girl in peoria id like
to pocket my cut

  there are no gems in this package
thats the answer i expected johnny
starr walked to the tent and commenced
kicking the stakes loose whether there
were any rocks in it or not

ii

fort cachot had a hundred-odd thatch
huts a traders house of kimberley
brick and some ruined government build-
ings where a detachment of native gen-
darmes had once been quartered

  a hook-nosed man with smoky skin and
black kinky hair came to the door of the
trade-house to greet starr as he walked up
the unpainted cobbles

  monsieur starr-dont tell me those
kama boys of yours dumped your precious
burdens and left you after all

  starr shook his head no leclerc
damned sorry to disappoint you but the
packages will be delivered safe enough
you do not disappoint me monsieur
you are my friend he was talking to
starr gesturing with his long gold-ringed

fingers but all the while his eyes kept
shifting to paulette who had seated herself
beneath a clump of nut-palms it is only
that you could so easily have traded your
gem rock to me at fine advantage and
then all the worry all the-

  i need some provisions for cash

  the mention of cash made leclerc stop
gesturing and rub his hands together i
am your servant monsieur

  starr walked past him to the dark ill-
smelling interior

  leclerc followed saying the woman
-she is very beautiful monsieur
im glad she pleases you

  when you left here four days ago i
did not know it was your plan to meet a
woman

  starr made no sign of hearing him he
looked at the shelves stocked with misera-
ble calcutta cottons bits of ornament
patent medicines ten-franc machetes and
canned goods

  i need bully-beef white meal and bot-
tled water

  bottled water and white meal mon-
sieur is not in leopoldville i have bully-
beef and mealie-meal he got down sev-
eral square cans and lifted a basket of
meal to the counter he did this watching
starr intently he spoke in a low signi-
ficant voice

  have you ever learned the language
of the talking drums monsieur

  no

  night before last monsieur a message
was heard here and relayed to the hills by
our kama drummers it seems that a
woman escaped from ngonde did you
know anything about it

  no starr growled

  it would appear that this woman who-
ever she is had something so precious
that the commissioner of lusambo prov-
ince would pay a reward the drums said
that the king of some village called lilua
would pay twenty kilograms of copper
wire and in addition there would be a
remission of head tax for five years to the
one who captured her but you and i know
that no village chief could promise a re-
mission of head tax no that would come
from the commissioner but if a white
man captured her what would copper wire
and head tax mean to him for a white
man the reward would be much more
the sorcerer of kambara



monsieur perhaps ten thousand francs
perhaps-

  why are you telling me this 

  it is only because i am your friend
i thought perhaps you had met this woman
not knowing who she was-

  starr cut him off with a laugh looking
contemptuously into his eyes you say
the woman escaped from ngonde how
do you think she got this far in two days
and a night-by flying carpet

  but i did not mean to suggest-

  he swung his hand knocking the cans
over the counter the bottoms are rotted
from your cans leclerc and your bully-
beef smells like carrion were you fath-
ered by a jackal and mothered by a swine
that you offer such things for a white man
to eat

  leclerc took no offense he merely set
the cans back on the shelf and hunted
good ones he spoke again his voice more
smoothly significant than ever

  the message came night before last
it is true but that is not saying when this
woman left ngonde it might have been
five days ago-a week but if you say
your womans not the one he shrug-
ged spreading his hands

  what do they want her for

  the drums did not say

  starr dumped the bully-beef in a can-
vas bag and set the basket of mealie-meal
on top of it better send a couple of your
boys over to clean the rest house

  it is clean monsieur the district ad-
ministrator slept there only last week
starr paused half way to the door i
havent got the woman youre talking
about leclerc but if i did have her id
collect the reward myself do you get
that-myself alone and any scheming
trader who tried to cut himself in would
be paid off with a  mm slug right in
the guts

  leclercs eyes were small and shiny
close together over his beaked nose watch-
ing starrs back as it disappeared through
the unscreened door

the rest house standing at one side
of the old compound had been recently
repaired and was still fairly substantial
it had two stories both fronted by veran-
dahs but the lower floors had drawn damp-
ness and were largely rotted away a lad-

der led to the second story which was di-
vided into four rooms with partitions of
woven bamboo

  one of the front rooms evidently used
by the administrator on his yearly visit
was furnished with an iron bedstead cir-
cled by a coarse textured mosquito net a
european rocker of a type popular fifty
years before a brass candle holder and
wash stand with pitcher a net of woven
bamboo strips had been stretched to form
a ceiling to mitigate the danger of a green
mamba or cobra dropping on the great
man

  starr gave paulette the administrators
room and took the one next to it himself
it was twilight when they finished prepar-
ing dinner on the tiny stove in the cook-kia
out back

  paulette had said little since their ex-
change that morning she sat across from
him drinking tea and eating meal-cake
and bully-beef unexpectedly she reached
across and laid a hand on his forearm

  you dont really believe im trying to
smuggle gems do you

  instead of making a direct answer he
said a woman lit out from the town
of ngonde a few days back ngondes 
that rickety rail line running down from
kambove i dont know whether youre
that woman or not but if you are it might
be a good idea to tell me so

  she smiled a little you really do want
to help me dont you

  of course

  wouldnt it surprise you mr starr
if i really were telling the truth if i
were that missionarys daughter trying to
escape from a ju-ju curse only that and
not involved in one of the ugly pieces of
business youve identified me with

  he watched her lift the fly-net door
of the cook-kia and walk across the baked-
clay earth to the front verandah ladder
when he went up half an hour later it
was almost dark the jalousies of her
room were pulled but he could see her
moving against the candlelight inside

  he called his two kama boys telling
them to sleep on the verandah near the
door and notify him in the event she tried
to leave during the night he then spread
his blanket on palm mattings and slept

  he awoke with a startled jerk it was
one of the soundless black hours of night


jungle stories

there had been something-a slight jar of
the rickety structure-perhaps a sound he
wasnt sure a dancing tom-tom had been
thum-thumming at the far end of the na-
tive village but it was silent now he
guessed that it was getting toward dawn
for those kama natives liked to dance
the night out and sleep all day

  for a long time he lay on his back
staring at the black void of ceiling ears
tuned for any interruption of the night
silence

  a slight glow from the vine-grown
verandah marked the position of the door
it had been closed when he went to bed

  he pushed himself gradually to a sitting
position he half rose pausing on one
knee his hand fumbled across the dried
and brittle palm mattings and located the
steel of his walther automatic

  it was a heavy gun the walther with
a thick grip made to fit his hand its
weight made him feel better he did not
snap the safety because of the slight click
it would make

  there was still no sound but he had be-
come conscious of something else-an
odor a sweaty native odor a man was
standing inside the room he had opened
the door and was standing there waiting
for starr to make some sound and reveal
his position

  a shift of weight creaked the building
nothing in the room though after a sec-
ond he identified it as someone climbing a
ladder to the verandah

  he rose with a sudden movement shift-
ing sidewise expecting a flash of explod-
ing powder-a bullet he paused near the
door fearing to silhouette himself star-
light reflected through the low-hanging
vines of the verandah showing paulettes
door-closed

  he had the impression of movement
close behind him he spun and collided
with the man the contact was a surprise
to both of them but starr was on the
move and movement allowed him to catch
his balance first he swung the walther
automatic barrel top foremost and it con-
nected

  he couldnt tell where it struck on the
mans neck perhaps it seemed to stun
the fellow a heavy object thudded to the
floor mat a gun starr could tell by its
sound he drove on catching the man with

his shoulder and ramming him to the
woven-bamboo partition

  theres a gun on you starr hissed
ramming the walther into the soft of the
mans bare abdomen

  the man stopped suddenly and starr
moved back a little

  dont shoot monsieur i don mean no
harm  

  leclerc he hissed

  yes it is me your good friend le-
clerc the man was almost sobbing from
fear i come to warn you the men
they-

 what men

  men of the territorial police they
ask for the woman but i do not tell i
sneak up here to warn you that-

  starr snarled you led them here for
your reward you told them she-
monsieur do not kill me you will
not kill me-

  we will see is she in her room
  yes

  where are the police 

  i theenk on the back verandah one
is hiding below in front

  there were only two

they have four boys but the boys-
walk ahead of me he rammed le-
clerc with the automatic and the man
walked stiffly ahead of its muzzle tread-
ing the floor in barefoot silence

  paulettes door had now opened and
the girl herself was standing there the
metal of a little flat automatic reflected
purplish black in her hand the canvas-
wrapped package was under her arm

  starr spoke in a side-of-the-mouth
whisper all right darling your ju-ju
men have arrived are you ready to hit
the bush

  she stepped outside to the hall she
was dressed ready for the trail

  he kept the gun on leclercs back-
bone and said to her go in and find my
veldtschoen and helmet

  she fumbled through the darkness of
his room a quarter-minute ticked by she
came out with the helmet and antelope
shoes he took time to put them on

  how are we going to get out she
asked

  leclerc our friend has volunteered to
lead us to safety thats what he came here
for-to help us
the sorcerer of kambara



  monsieur leclerc whimpered

  marche starr hissed

  leclerc walked stiffly along the dark
little hallway netting had been tacked
across the door to the rear verandah and
he had to tear it to get outside its noise
ripped explosively through the black
silence

  halt the cry sounded close-a high-
pitched european voice

  it is me wailed leclerc he glanced
around and noticed that starr was no
longer close behind him he plunged face
foremost on the verandah floor his ter-
rified voice rose pleading the man not to
shoot as he beat the floor crawling for
concealment

  where are they the man barked

  i do not know they were here by
back door both of them the gun mon-
sieur do not point at me the gun it was
not my fault-

  starr had seized the girls wrist and was
pulling her in the opposite direction he
found the verandah rail vines had grown
from the earth below spreading in masses
over the floor to tangle their feet

  she still clutched the automatic had the
package under her other arm he had to
wait seconds while she put the gun away
he seized her wrists and bent over the
rail lowering her to the ground there
was a sharp cracking of vines rendered
sere by the long dry season

starr dropped beside her a few sec-
onds later they reached beaten earth
back of the house moon and stars were
indistinct through smoke-hazy atmosphere
and what little light they gave was blotted
up by a giant-arching tacula tree

  starr drew up sensing movement be-
side him a man loomed up revealed by
his whites it was still a fraction of time
before he noticed starr and the girl he
turned grunting alarm

  starrs left hand darted out quick as
the head of a cobra seizing the mans gun
hand twisting it up

  explosion and yellow powder flame
whipped close above

  the man twisted to free himself he
was big and heavy muscled he tore free
starr could have killed him of course in-
stead he swung his pistol in a swift arc it
connected solidly the man stumbled over

his toes and starr had to move aside to
let him fall

  paulette

  her voice answered quite close from
the shadow he seized her wrist

  well circle the compound the foot-
path leads straight north from the village
street i dont think theyll follow us to-
night

  it was blind going through forest for a
short distance then the footpath wound
across the humitiocky ground of a cac-
sava patch beyond that there were millet
fields and then the seas of savannah
grass

  three or four kilometers south of fort
cachot a series of felsite dikes broke
through the gently sloping strata of shale
and lime forming a series of escarpments
with flat terraces between at the crest of
the first one starr paused to look back at
the village torches were burning here
and there and a lamp lighted the corner
of the rest house

  want to change your mind starr
asked

  about what

  about going to bonde those police
will have a good idea youre headed there

  of course im not changing my mind

  he said no more about it they traveled
steadily as dawn came up from the vast
lowlands of the congo at mid-morning
they paused in a little clump of thorn
trees

  smoke starr asked offering her
papers and native tobacco

  paulette shook her head she sat on the
ground and removed her boots there were
holes in her dark knee-length stockings

  she said im afraid youd ask if i got
the tobacco habit at the mission

  starr laughed to hell with the mis-
sion

  she kept looking at him who are
you 

  me you know me dont you starr
johnny starr

termined tramp i came from the capital

lows from nippon put an end to that i
managed to beat them to singapore threw
one quick stengah into me and lit out for
calcutta anybody with an fms address
is a rubber expert so the americans sent
me here with the blessing of the belgian
government-in-exile to talk the natives into
gathering wild rubber if a black man
wont gather rubber by free will hell do
it with a chain around his neck we
just hunted the vines down and chopped
them off taking all the latex they would
bleed the old golden-egg treatment know
how much latex the congo beige produced
in  i was a hero then banquet in
leopoldville oh the hell with it one day
the nips tossed in the sponge and i was
out of a job so i took to the kamakamas
trading jacknives for blue-tone peredotite
thats what my safari was carrying out
up in elizabethville there are some arab
lapidaries who can take quartz crystals
apart facet by facet and never chip one
milligram off a piece of aquamarine ill
make a nice blue bauble for you sometime
darling provided those kama boys of mine
dont dump my rock and go home
you did make a sacrifice to help me
dont forget it may cost you a little
something whats in that package
darling

  she was very serious her eyes sad as
she looked at him theres nothing in this
package that would be worth a cent to you
its worth a great deal to him-to my
brother but not to anyone else

  starr laughed and lighted a cigarette

ill

bande-moke was a town of fifty
europeans and three hundred or more
ba-fiot and abunda tribesmen it was sit-
uated at a thousand meters of altitude
and fortunately somewhat beyond the do-
main the tsetse fly for these reasons ju-
lien sibree the district administrator
had chosen it as his headquarters although
his mail was officially addressed to kikwit
a hundred kilometers to the northeast

  at first view bande-moke was not im-
pressive the footpath became a street
once cobbled but now mostly baked dirt
with ruts left over from the last rainy
season the street wound for half a kilo
through an amorphous assortment of na-

tive huts and graneries-on-stilts to the
small cluster of white mans buildings
which formed the core of the town these
included the two-story maison alfort
some grog-shops a store an arab meat
stall smelling to allahs heaven and a
rust-encrusted sheet-metal warehouse and
depot built to accommodate the railroad
whose arrival had been momentarily ex-
pected ever since the passage of the co-
lonial developments act in 

  from the center of town one had a good
view of the administrators house a struc-
ture of sawed lumber and sheet metal
freshly coated with white paint from the
government plant in leopoldville its broad
double verandahs and palm shade giving it
an air of cool detachment from the rest of
the dusty town a dry-season lorry road
had been built by the union miniere for its
paillette diamond mine to melange in
angola but the road missed bande by
three kilometers and that evening when
starr and paulette arrived the only ve-
hicle in sight was a two-wheelecl bush cart-
with a degenerate brown pony between the
shafts

  you know where to find him starr
asked

  paul

  is that your brothers name

  he said something about the maison
alfort

  starr led her to the hotel he had not
been inside the building for three years
but he immediately saw that nothing had
changed there was the front door still
in need of new netting the little copper
ant-trap just inside the sill dry of creo-
sote solution and no matter for ants had
found a hundred means of access through
the floor the lobby was very dim filled
with dusty dwarf-oranges and frangapanis
in wooden tubs a tiny counter of varn-
ished mahogany stood at one end of the
lobby and behind it as always was fat
madame bovesse

  ah monsieur starr she exclaimed
shaking her wattles in effusive hospitality
our poor maison it is honored

  starr laughed and flipped open the mil-
dewed guest book to sign his name i take
it business is poorer than on my last visit

  indeed monsieur madame bovesse
wrang her chunky hands aglitter with sec-
ond-quality diamonds it was unfortun-
the sorcerer

of kambara



ate your last visit how many times i have
wept to think of it monsieur but there
were only so many rooms and if the gov-
ernment mission should arrive at the
very-

  sure forget it

  madame bovesse beamed at paulette
perhaps this is madame starr

  he didnt answer instead he asked is
paul payen staying here

  paul payen no monsieur i know no
paul payen

  starrs face was inscrutable forgive
me madame bovesse i should have in-
troduced you he bowed flourishing his
stained sun helmet madame bovesse
madame starr paulette stared at him
and starr went on we will have two
rooms adjoining of course preferably
on the front verandah

  madame bovesse smirked shaking a fat
forefinger adjoining rooms la now
one would think you an old married
couple-

  there were no keys to the rooms
madame bovesse merely recited their
numbers and collected a nights rent in
advance once they were out of sight
climbing the rickety verandah stairs
paulette hissed

  why did you call me madame starr
because its quite obvious you have
no brother here and unattended white
women are always a point of concern for
the colonial administration i took it for
granted you did not care to be investi-
gated

  i do have a brother here

  he paused holding open the insect-proof
door to her room he was smiling his
scar twisting the close moustache out of
kilter you heard what she said-no paul
payen

  you might as well know it-he cant
use his real name he is wanted by the
police

  starr laughed what you missionary
children dont get yourselves into

  she tossed her head and walked past
him to the room

  starr went below to the piccinin kia
where he showered with water from the
sun tank he shaved trimmed his
moustache and when he was finished a

jungle stories

houseboy arrived with a fresh suit of
whites from the arabs tailor stall across
the street when he came out the sun had
been down for an hour and it was deep
twilight

paulettes room was dark he
knocked without getting an answer
the dinner gong had sounded fifteen or
twenty minutes before so he went down-
stairs there were six persons all men
sitting in the stuffy dining room carrying
on a dispirited conversation over their
manioc and pineapple salad

  one of them a spidery portuguese
named delcampo beamed when he saw
starr he arose and wiped oil from his
fingers before shaking hands

  starr said well delcampo still grow-
ing rich in the palm oil business i sup-
pose

  i do well enough with the nuts selling
at three-francs-seven even an iberian
can make money at such prices

  starr sat down and helped himself to
salad it was too liberally drenched with
brown north african olive oil but still
palatable later there were tiny fried
eggs covered with ashanti and some
rather good white-flour bread the dinner
was topped off with tiny cups of syrupy
extract-coffee

  starr said you havent seen a young
white woman a stranger

  indeed senhor any white woman
would be a stranger are you really
serious 

  of course she arrived with me and-
and you have let her escape already
starr smiled throwing his close-clipped
moustache ff kilter is there any don
juan around here except yourself per-
haps a young fellow of flemish blood
from the congo country

  named paul durand

  his name might easily be paul durand
when did he get here

  delcampo shrugged he was here when
i arrived last week i never saw him be-
fore do you remember pablo albenese
of course

  they seem to have something in com-
mon i dare say thats no recommenda-
tion

  albenese is he here

  in this very hotel senhor it appears

that his plantation runs itself quite well
without supervision you recall that south-
west suite above-the one with the cross-
ventilation where a man might almost
sleep during the rains now behold these
three rooms belong to our albenese-or
more exactly to albenese and certain of
his friends such as paul durand and that
dull ape viga whom the french would like
to execute when a man succeeds he makes
enemies and viga is his bodyguard no
less so you see how our albenese is com-
ing up in the world

  starr stood up with an abrupt move-
ment he takes his dinner in private
i suppose

  on special  occasions delcampo
smiled arching his eyebrows no doubt
this is one of them one does not enter-
tain a strange young white woman every
day in the year

  starr went to the lobby he remem-
bered pablo albenese quite well he had
visited him at jonzhe his plantation back
in  to negotiate the purchase of a
dozen metric tons of crude rubber a
short time later it happened that albenese
was hauled before the commissioner on
a charge of chain-whipping one of his
blacks the business nearly cost albenese
his government concessions and after-
ward he falsely blamed starr for report-
ing him

  madame bovesse was not behind her
counter he found her in a little incense-
reeking parlor reading a month-old copy
of le petite journal

  is senhor albenese taking dinner in
his rooms he asked

  she folded the paper and took off her
horn-rimmed glasses her eyes were small
and near-sighted in the midst of a puffy
face

  i will not have trouble in my house
monsieur i wish you to bear in mind that
monsieur albenese is hot tempered and
moreover a man of substance who-
who is a devil of a lot more valuable
as a guest than i am i asked you a ques-
tion is he having dinner in his rooms
she cleared her throat it is my belief
that he is

  dinner for how many

  i do not know

  ill learn from the cook-boy so you
might as well tell me
the sorcerer of kambara

  a dinner for three though i cannot
understand-

  thank you madame bovesse your
loyalty will be remembered in my semi-
annual report

  he bowed with a crisp official man-
ner and went out laughing after the door
was closed lights burned in a row of
windows at the south-west side of the
verandah the bamboo jalousies had been
closed but the windows were open and
he could hear well enough he paused

  pablo albenese suffered from some
chronic obstruction of the sinuses and his
tone coming through the open window
was unmistakable he was speaking
french with exaggerated fluency after
the latin manner recounting some bit of
cinema gossip picked up on the wireless
after a time he paused and there was po-
lite laughter-two voices a mans and a
womans the woman was paulette

  someone came around the corner and
starr struck a match pretending to light
his already lighted cigarette over the
flame he could see that the man was an
african of some half-arab sahara tribe
viga albeneses knifeman probably
starr flipped the match and inhaled let-
ting smoke drift from his nostrils
what you want the man asked

  starr was in no hurry to answer he
slowly appraised the man six feet
shoulders sloping with muscle his eyes
were dull-witted his earlobes drooping
beneath the weight of heavy gold rings
on his head was a small red topi

  starr said its none of your damned
business what i want and after this re-
member to remove your topi when you
speak to me

  the mans mind worked slowly like a
mechanism gummed in heavy oil he stood
quite still for three or four seconds then
he exhaled violently and started forward
on flat splayed feet as though intent on
seizing starr and hurling him over the
verandah rail he drew up suddenly with
small eyes on the muzzle of the walther
automatic

 did you hear me starr asked
softly

  the native fell back a step his hand
brushed the top of his shaved head re-
moving the topi yes bwana

jungle stories

  and next time dont wait for me to
draw the gun

 yes bwana

  they had stopped talking inside there
was a padded sound of feet and the door
was opened a slim angular man stood
silhouetted by lamplight

  hello pablo starr said calling al-
benese by his first name

it took a few seconds for albeneses
sharp protruding eyeballs to locate
starr in the half-darkness he stepped on
outside starr slid the walther back in its
holster

  ah it is you senhor starr this is
an unlooked for pleasure-

  its not unlooked for and its not a
pleasure lets keep it honest pablo
ah you americans so abrupt al-
benese was large boned but skinny a trifle
under six feet about forty years old his
skin had a naturally deep pigment and it
had been turned almost black by years
of equatorial sun his eyes at first glance
seemed crossed but that was because they
lay so close against his high and narrow-
bridged nose

  you may go now viga albenese said
keeping his voice soft

  the native backed away his truculent
eyes still on starr

  you must forgive him albenese went
on he has-orders my orders he is
naturally suspicious perhaps he thought
you wished to eavesdrop ridiculous-
no

  thats exactly what i was doing
  albenese arched his eyebrows

  i said id keep it honest come on
down to my room id like to have a few
words with you

  a second man had come to the door
light fell across the side of his face
he was about twenty-five clean shaven
except for his close moustache the
moustache gave him a resemblance to
starr-a superficial resemblance for there
was a vacillating quality about his face that
or a handsome irresponsibility

  anything wrong he asked

  nothing wrong paul please tell the
young lady i will return my friend would
have a word with me

  starr led albenese to his room he
strucka match and carried it to the petrol

lamp the chimney was so deeply browned
that even with the flame turned up there
was little light

  he said you know that the girl-
paulette-wouldnt have got here without
my help dont you

  indeed i was not aware-

  well you are now we were alone out
there in the bush you know there was
nothing to stop me taking that package
away from her if id wanted to

  ah breathed albenese watching
him with his pointed eyeballs but you
were restrained by your instincts as a
gentleman

  i have instincts but none of them
prompt me to be a gentleman

  albenese laughed showing teeth turned
brownish from betel nut chewing

  very funny

  to get to the point pablo the pack-
age reached here through my efforts and
i expect a cut of its contents

  and what are its contents senhor
he watched starr closely smiling a little
gems perhaps or at least a few balls of
crude opium from the poppy fields of
bahr el arab ah no i must disappoint
you it was nothing like that merely some
papers of private interest to her brother
paul i thought of course she had already
told you

  he shrugged inadvertently

  dont forget pablo that it would be
easy for me to walk up that hill and tell
julien sibree that paul payen and his
sister are stopping with you

  you could do that perhaps you would
-except that your own small part in ef-
fecting their reunion here would not be
so easy to explain

  albenese left chuckling to himself with
great complacence

  to hell with it starr growled he
blew out the petrol lamp flung his fresh
whites carelessly to one side and lay on
his back inside the mosquito nettings he
wanted to sleep but instead he lay awake
listening for the sound of paulettes voice
drums beat with a regular thum tlium ta
ta-thum somewhere in the native end of
town downstairs a wireless brought in
some jazz recordings over intermittent
rattles of static he fell asleep not know-
ing when she returned to her room next
door
the sorcerer of kambara



iv

he arose at six oclock just as the

sun came up through the smoky air
it was cool on the verandah he paused
to try her door latch it was fastened on
the inside it made him feel better he
went down the verandah stairs and had
an early breakfast of fried canned pork
and cakes made to imitate scones but yel-
low from saffron and strong of the un-
known spices that make african cooking
the most vile on earth

  he was sitting in a rattan chair with his
feet on the verandah rail when paulette
came from her room

  she paused and spoke to him he did
not bother to get up he said in his abrupt
manner

  lacking more direct information i
would assume that your journey here has
been a success

  she drew her eyebrows together over
her small well-formed nose

  im sorry i should have told you how
much i appreciated all-

  forget the formality a little of that
stuff spreads a long way in this climate
like oil on water i just wanted to hear
from your own sweet lips that paul was
your brother and that whatever you had in
that package saved him from a fate worse
than death

  his tone even more than his words
exasperated her why do you act that
way she burst out

 what way

  why are you so-crude

  starr laughed i dont darling i used
to work with a mining geologist over in
fms and he said it all came from an
inferiority complex im really tender and
mild down inside-just like one of those
hard-shelled kaffir oranges

  she turned and strode away a light silk
bathrobe pulled close around her throat
she turned unexpectedly and came part
way back he noticed she was was biting
down hard on her lower lip

  i really do appreciate everything you
did for me ive tried to thank you i
cant understand why youre so abrupt
with me

fortable

  youll forgive me for saying so he
growled but that brother of yours has
all the earmarks of a grade b tramp and
atbenese-how much did you know about
him when you came she didnt answer
so he asked did you already know al-
benese 

  she shook her head

  hes a plantation owner a big one
jonzhe dont let those baggy pants and
brown teeth fool you chicken he could
sell out for plenty of pounds sterling i
went over to jonzhe in  rubber it was
like gold and so he had his native boys
out tapping the wild stuff he was paying
a bonus to the one who smoked out the
most in each weeks time three or four
francs-but thats lots of dough to a na-
tive are you interested

  of course

  well one of his boys ibenbou his
name was took the bonus on two suc-
cessive weeks albenese got to noticing
that the balls of crude measured small for
their weight so he cut one open and found
some scrap iron in the middle he tied
ibenbou up and whipped him with a length
of chain hook half the skin off his ribs
afterward he rubbed salt in the wounds
and left him hung up in the sun his
family sneaked around and cut him down
but it was too late it was just like hed
been broiled-that sun on cut flesh-
keep quiet

   all right darling i just wanted to let
you know the kind of company youve
chosen

  i dont believe it

  he laughed showing his strong white
teeth the hell you dont

  she ran down the stairs with the light
robe floating behind her he was still sit-
ting there when she returned from the
bath house with a towel wrapped around
her shampooed hair

  he said smiling now i know what
you had wrapped up in  that package
darling it was a silk robe and a set of
those lacy things you were just too modest
to tell me werent you

  she drew up color rising beneath the
deep tan of her cheeks

  he said dont worry i havent got
a peep-hole drilled through that grass wall
you just ran down the stairs a little faster
than you intended thats all

  she walked in her room slamming the
door

  the sun became hot and-the wind still
came from the south-west paulette had
breakfast with her brother in albeneses
apartments they went someplace to-
gether starr remained in his chair de-
manding that the houseboy bring him sun-
downers made with scotch and ice but
each time getting tepid concoctions of
synthetic cognac with water from the
evaporation cooler

  the wind died as the close heat of mer-
idian crept over the forty mark on the
centigrade thermometer he took siesta-a
long one-and awoke when shadows of
evening were darkening the reddish dirt
of the street

  a negro militiaman in neat brown shorts
and shirt climbed the stairs and saluted
smartly with bare heels pressed together

  monsieur starr

  starr nodded drank the heel of his
late-afternoon sundowner and said i
suppose his excellency the administrator
sent for me 

  the militiaman looked surprised and
nodded

  have the gentlemen of the colonial
police arrived

  i do not know monsieur

  you want my gun i suppose starr
held the walther out balanced across the
palm of his hand butt first

  i am not arresting you monsieur i
have not the power to make arrests only
to provide the escort arrests-

  did his excellency happen to men-
tion a young woman

  no monsieur

  it was a quarter-hour walk to the gov-
ernment house a blue-black layer of
clouds had built up in the west covering
the sunset beyond bande the forest
country looked blue-black accentuating the
new painted whiteness of the big build-
ing

  the militiaman stopped at the lower
steps letting starr walk on by himself

  starr old fellow the voice came
from above it had an accent at once flem-
ish and british-like a dutch frenchman
who has taken his degree at oxford if one
could imagine such a thing im up here
you know

  starr backed until he could see heavy
the sorcerer oe kambara



smiling julien sibree the administrator
standing by one of the large bamboo pil-
lars which supported the upper verandah
roof

there was a stairway inside but the
servants ladder was closer at hand
so starr climbed it julian sibree a
stocky and rather flabby man of about
fifty walked over with wrinkled whites
sticking to his legs and shook hands with
him beyond seated at a table was a pow-
erful and deeply bronzed man with a thick
black moustache trained in a manner
reminiscent of the late kaisers a red
welt ran from the edge of his oily hair
down across his forehead hed had it
bandaged recently for the parallel marks
of adhesive tape still clung to his skin
the man was watching intently but starr
did not seem to notice

  sibree led him to the table saying i
delayed sending until after your siesta
sibree kept rubbing his hands to-
gether and clearing his throat at last he
went on do you by any chance know
why i sent for you

   id hoped it was to prove that you still
use genuine ice in your sundowners
sibree struck a bell of native-cut
nephrite and a black boy came in button-
ing his starched stengah-shifter sibree
gestured at the glasses and he gathered
the empty ones carrying them inside

  this is monsieur grondon sibree
said tilting his head at the black-mustached
man monsieur grondon is with the
gendarmerie

  he had deliberately neglected to intro-
duce them before and he did so now in a
manner which apologized to starr for
bringing him across the table from one not
considered his cultural equal sibree sat
down and drummed his fingers on the
blackish okume table top he was waiting
for gfondon to carry on from there and
when that did not happen when grondon
merely stared at starr with unchanged
truculence he said

  monsieur of the police has an idea you
are involved in a certain theft which took
place at the town of ngonde five days
ago i explained that seven days ago i
knew from my vice-commissioners report
that you were just leaving the kamakamas

jungle stories

with some gem rock how you could reach
ngonde in two days has not been explained
to me

  i have a flying carpet starr said
dryly i use it by daylight when i travel
at night im partial to the old-fashioned
broomstick

  grondon did not smile he commenced
to speak pronouncing his words slowly

  you left the kamakamas as the ad-
ministrator says seven days ago three
days later you camped at bonde river
next morning you met a woman named
paulette payen whether by accident or
prearrangement i do not know she had
with her a certain package she had stolen
it from the strong-files of central en-
gineering associates where she was em-
ployed sergeant larue myself and six
native paddlers tried to approach your
camp and were fired on you drove us
ashore in the jungle and it took us an
hour to reach the campsite by that time
the girl and yourself were gone

  starr asked what was in the pack-
age by the way

  you are quite well aware what was in
the package

  no

  but you dont deny meeting the wo-
man

   starr shrugged of course i met her
sibree got half way to his feet and sat
down again oh i say old man you
didnt really

  you were never one who could resist
a pretty face yourself starr grinned

  but you must see that this places a
new complexion on the matter

  the blackboy came carrying the
tinkling sundowners no one spoke until
he withdrew

   starr said

 grondon you still havent told me what
it was the girl stole

  i do not know what it was

  starr laughed that must complicate
things for you-not even knowing what
youre looking for

  i know they were papers of great
value locked inside a leather portmanteau
bearing the name central engineering as-
sociates die-stamped in the leather and i
know that it must be returned he
slammed the table with the palm of his
hand at all costs it must be returned

  arresting me wont get it back-for i
dont have it

  but you know how you can get it

  do i

  indeed monsieur for your sake i
hope you do the girl-she is still at the
maison alfort you should be able to
plan the rest

  what if shes already passed it on to
albenese hes wound up in thisrthing
somehow you know

  sibree cried yes albenese hes the
swine we should get that whipper of
natives-

  the portmanteau and its contents are
what we must get monsieur

  how long will you give me starr
asked

  until morning if you have succeeded
in returning the portmanteau by then the
entire affair will be forgotten

  even to the bruise i gave you back at
fort cachot 

  even to that

v

the cloud area was dense purple-
gray bringing on early darkness
when starr left the government house a
few big spatters of rain slanted in on the
gusty wind after the long dry season it
was sharp and fresh to the nostrils a
union miniere vanette stood in front of
a grog-shop he could hear an accordion
inside and four mens voices singing roll
out the barrel to french words

  starr crossed the street but he was
wrong about one of the voices belonging
to paul payen he had never seen the
men before

  the wind was growing stronger bend-
ing the clustered palm trees by the maison
alfort stringing their fronds out in long
streamers he walked beneath them and
inside the salon

  dinner wras being served in the little
dining room seated were the same six
men who had been there the night before
he went back outside and climbed the
verandah stairs

  there was a light burning in one room
on the west side he tried paulettes door
it opened and he stepped inside the room
seemed close after the rainy wind outside
it was filled with odors of dried thatch
the sorcerer of kambara



and mattings of creosote from the ant
cans in which the bed legs rested and
faintly the modest perfume he had
learned to associate with paulette

  he struck a match her silk robe was
hanging on one of the pegs there was
no closet or dresser it took only a few
seconds to make sure that the portmanteau
was not there the match burned his fing-
ers

  paulettes voice startled him

  what were you looking for

  he spun around she had been standing
in the protection of a porch pillar

  you know well enough what i want
the package i suppose you still
think its filled with diamonds

  i have no idea whats in it i know it
came from the strong-files of central en-
gineering associates in ngonde and i
know ill very likely end up in that louse-
crawling leopoldville bastille unless i get
it back by morning maybe youll end up
in the bastille too darling wouldnt that
be cozy

  she came towards him the damp wind
whipped a strand of hair across her
browned cheek

  the gendarmes followed us here after
all

  of course we couldnt lose them that
easy i just had a heart-to-heart chat with
a greasy-moustached individual by the
name of grondon smart that grondon
knew better than try to swoop down on
the nest himself he thought i could do it
better and so here i am he patted her
shoulder come on tell me how your
heart bleeds for me

  ill admit i took it i worked there-
for central engineering my brother used
to work for them too he was a sur-
veyor he took something-at least they
said he did i dont believe it anyway
they would have sent him to prison he
found out that they had the evidence in
a portfolio locked in the file cabinets he
asked me to get it for him i was book-
keeper and had access to the vault i did
it i couldnt let them send him to prison
not for something he didnt do

  all right that was a beautiful story
only it doesnt hold water any better than
a grass hat if that portfolio had contained
evidence why didnt he have you take it

                                                  i

jungle stories

and throw it in the river why did you
have to deliver it here

  he seized her shoulders and turned her
so she had to look at him answer me
you cant believe that

  i dont know i dont know why it had
to be brought here the portmanteau was
locked i didnt try to open it i just
wrapped it in canvas-

  besides if they were trying to send
him to the bastille why did he stop on
this side of the angola border no your
brother is just a tramp and albenese is a
tramp you know that as well as i do
they framed you into getting something
that puts the colonial government right
square behind that little black ball weve
got to get it back

  she stared at him without answering
we have to get it back he repeated
she made a sudden movement yes ill
go to him ill tell him-

  youll tell him nothing does he have
it or does albenese

  i dont know i gave it to paul last
night i didnt-

  where are they-paul and albenese
i dont know i havent seen them since
siesta paul said something about having
a headache-

  well look around

  the wind died some and the rain was
coming hard striking with a hissing sound
against the dry thatch overhead over the
sound of rain and wind-whipping vines
they could hear the thin babble of madame
boveeses gramaphone playing an old
parisien jazz hit

  he walked with paulette to albeneses
apartment no light shone through the
closed shutters and they did not try the
door around thecorner there was the
single lighted window with the jalousies
closed she hesitated

  his room

  she nodded yes he must be there
let me see him-alone

  he waited in the shadows she rapped
-waited there was no answer she tried
the door it opened she stopped suddenly
a scream rising in her throat starr was
at her side with a long stride he saw paul
payen standing against the far wall a
heavy automatic pistol in his hand

  pauls eyes were bright and quick hed
been smoking and starr recognized the

odor the tobacco had been liberally spiked
with hashish it took paul a moment to
realize it was his sister in the door

  paul she went inside she stopped
and looked at an open carryall bag on the
floor what are you doing

  with a quick nervous movement he
thrust the automatic back in its shoulder
holster

  what does it look like im doing
he snapped her expression of shock and
disbelief seemed to exasperate him do
you expect me to stay here in this town
there are gendarmes here-did you know
that gendarmes you led here they let
you get away from them knowing youd
lead them to me and that fellow who
came with you-that american hes
probably in with them pauls eyes sud-
denly focused on starr standing just out-
side the doorway his hand raced under
his coat   

  dont go for your gun starr said
striding inside

paul tried to retreat but the bed was
behind him he moved aside his
shoulder catching the mosquito net and
tearing it there was a glimmer of lamp-
light on metal as the automatic came out
starr did not try to draw his left fist
traveled in a sharp hook connecting with
the young mans jaw

  pauls head snapped the gun spun from
his fingers he went down with the back
of his head banging the floor he pushed
himself to a sitting position his eyes
baffled and out of focus his dark hair
strung over his forehead

  paulette seized starrs arm he jerked
away

  close the door he said

  she did as he commanded

  paul got to his feet shaking the fog
from his brain he looked around and
located the pistol its flat side reflecting
lamplight it was too far away he wailed
at his sister

  see i told you he was-

  keep still growled starr

  starr glanced in the carryall case it
contained clothing ammunition a supply
of tinned food

  going someplace he asked

  thats none of your damned business
im going to get away from this hell-
the sorcerer of kambara



spot in the jungle and dont you-
why do you need to escape didnt
the portmanteau hold all the evidence they
had against you

  for a second paul failed to compre-
hend then he laughed tossing his head
to get the hair from his eyes that you
still think there really was such stuff in
the package if there had been id have
had sis burn it back in ngonde

  what was in the portmanteau

  you mean to say youve been bumbling
around all this time and havent found
out all right ill tell you and you too
sis ill make a deal with you you let me
head for portuguese territory and ill not
only tell you whats in it but ill tell you
where you can get it

  all right its a deal

maps thats what in it- the most
valuable maps on the african continent
starr laughed dont tell me let me
guess its the map to the queen of
shebas mines

  theyre the maps that central en-
gineering got approved four months ago
showing the route-

  paul the girl seized his sleeve
jerking him half way around not that
you didnt get me to bring you-

  sure i did i knew where they had the
maps locked up but they ran me out be-
fore i had a chance to get hold of them
i knew you could get them but i knew
youd never stoop so low so i told you
it was evidence that would-

  the maps to what starr shouted
the surveyers maps showing the new
rail line from port fracqui to leopold-
ville of course and the branch theyre
running to angola too they were keep-
ing the route secret-that damned schem-
ing colonial administration they wanted
to go first buying back concessions gobbl-
ing every stinking malaria-reeking planta-
tion on the right of way knowing they
could resell them for twenty times the
value once there was transportation to
market

  and youre leaving for angola with-
out them

  what would they be worth to me i
have no money to go around buying plan-
tations-not at one copper franc the hec-
tare dont you think ive found out what

jungle stories

albeneses game is dont you think i
know what he plans doing about me yes
and probably with sis too hell let us
take the blame for everything and after
that-

  where are they starr barked
the maps  albenese has them
theyre locked in his room paul leaned
forward grasping the back of a rattan
chair with long sensitive fingers his eyes
were still intense from the hashish hed
smoked

  he said the maps are in his strong-
box its a big chest of tacula wood with a
padlock on it its in a little closet off the
main room just beyond the bed theres
a bead drape in front of it albenese
isnt there hes over at the wine garden
to hire a fellow that has a vanete he wants
them to haul him to jonzhe you can get in
the window the second from the corner
theres a catch on the shutter but the
screws are rotted out

  how about that knife man-viga
  hes with albenese

  starr picked up pauls automatic it was
a browning from the belgian factory he
slid it in his belt and walked to the door
he paused just outside nodding for
paulette to follow him

  he spoke softly from the side of his
mouth well have to keep him here in
case hes lying about the portmanteau yes
i know hes your brother and youd do
anything for him but it means his neck as
much as ours to get those maps back

  he handed her the browning keep
him here

  i couldnt he knows i couldnt shoot
hed-

  point it at him and do your best act
mad no mans ever sure whether a woman
will pull a trigger

yi

he left her and walked around the
corner albeneses rooms were still
dark he found the shutter and pulled
hard the screws were rotted out just as
paul had said he stepped inside

  it was a corner room and the wind had
carried away the heat of the afternoon
but he could smell the european perfume
with which albenese liked to annoint him-
self

  he stood still listening the rain was
letting up and he could hear the accordion
from the grog-shop across the street in-
side the room was the insistent tick-tick of
a small clock

  he walked carefully feeling his way
along the netting which circled the bed
around tables and chairs his foot touched
something he recognized it instantly and
started back-a revulsive movement he
bent over it was the body of a man
vaguely discernible by the whites he wore

  the odor of perfume was strong he
seized the mans shoulder and turned him
he was dead but still loose and disjointed
the back of his coat was turning stiff
from blood

  starr was still uncertain of the mans
identity he struck a match the quick
flame revealed albeneses sharp-beaked
face the pointed eyeballs staring he tried
to shake out the match but its chemical
head blazed for what seemed like many
seconds

  he left albenese and walked to the bead
drape the tiny cubbyhole beyond was a
well of darkness he would need a light
he went back to the table located the
petrol lamp the beaded drape was swing-
ing making a rattling sound in the dark
behind him he struck a match it was a
while before the mantle took hold fill-
ing the room with pure white light he
went from window to window closing
the jalousies

  albeneses clothes hung on a rod along
the middle of the closet in the
back was the large chest of tacula wood
oiled and rubbed to bring out its blood-
red color as paul said it was padlocked

  the lock was a heavy one of american
manufacture he drew his pistol and re-
considered he went to where albenese
was lying and hunted through his pockets
no key he found a short bronze bar
once part of some hand-operated punkahs
it was a foot in length and thick as his
thumb he fitted it in the lock staple and
levered it out the dry wood giving a
sharp ripping crash

  the chest contained a couple of old-
style tommy-guns with pie-plate maga-
zines a quantity of dynamite with the
nitro drained out leaving its oily dis-
coloration on the bottom of the chest
a canvas money sack bearing the imprint
the sorcerer of kambara



 of the banque commerciale dtt congo
 he opened the sack and found an assort-
 ment of slum-quality gold and silver
 jewelry a watch a crude ivory crucifix

   he backed rising and whirling around
 there had been no sound-only the trem-
 ble of the termite-eaten floor the front
 door was still closed he sensed a move-
 ment to his right viga

   the huge saharah tribesman had let
 himself in silently by the rear door he
 was crouched forward arms hanging
 loose a luger pistol clutched in his right
 lhand

  for the moment he did not seem to
 notice starr he was looking at the prone
 and silent form of pablo albenese

   starr whirled away from the closet
 his hand reaching for his automatic the
 gun was half drawn when viga moving
 with unexpected quickness swept up a
 chair and flung it waist high

   it struck starr hammering the gun
 from his hand he had no time to re-
 trieve it he dived clutching vigas
 wrist forcing the luger pistol high

   they reeled against the wall starr
 knew he was no match for the native in
 a test of strength he let the hand go
 took a quick back step and pumped a
 right to the jaw

   viga absorbed the blow with no change
 in his small brute eyes the luger was
 still above his head he did not try to

  he let go the gun barrel reached
 high seizing the net and tearing it from
 its pull-cord it fell in filmy tangling
 masses from which viga fought to extri-

jungle stories

jerked him to his feet his right fist
swung again viga went down his eyes
rolling white like a steers under the
mallet

  starr dragged him across the room
leaning as he went to pick up his walther
pistol viga staggered up as starr was
dragging him he fell and got up again
they reached the verandah where rain
was still pounding viga kept muttering
fighting the net starr let him tear head
and shoulders free then shouldered him
suddenly knocking him sprawling over
the verandah rail

  he struck the earth below on out-
stretched hands he got up and splashed
away across the street at a staggering
terrified gallop

  starr noticed his lip was bleeding he
sponged blood with his sleeve while re-
turning to paul payens room

the door was closed he booted it
open paulette was facing him with
her little black automatic aimed at his
heart come inside she said

  he stood quite still the walther dang-
ling at the floor her gun was only one
of those little  mms that women like
to carry in their handbags but it was
held very steadily

  he walked inside wheres paul
he asked

  on his way to angola close the
door

  he did so

  drop your gun

  the fingers of his left hand opened
and the walther thudded muzzle-first

  she said dont come any closer

  mind if i sit down

  go ahead

  he lowered himself to a chair-his
movements very deliberate as though he
feared he might jar the hair trigger of
her automatic

  mind if i smoke

  not at all

  he drew out papers and a pouch of
dark native leaf with practiced move-
ments he twisted a cigarette he struck a
match

  you knew the portmanteau was gone
from albeneses room all the time didnt
you you knew hed send viga to finish
me off as soon as i got there too

  viga

  dont act surprised by the way who
was it that killed albenese paul

  she nodded but i didnt know he
didnt tell me till after you left

  how long are we going to sit here
  long enough

  he smoked the cigarette down to his
fingers ground out the stub on the floor
mattings and rolled another a trickle of
water came through the slatted bamboo
ceiling and struck the floor with a rapid
thud-thud-thud

  theyll have to thatch that roof be-
fore the rains starr remarked

  her face looked drawn but somehow
younger than before

  nervous he asked dont be dar-
ling i wouldnt harm you for the world
it just occurred to me what a fool you
were for not leaving with him hell have
to get out of this town-quick-like we
got out of fort cachot to angola and
farther than that now that they have
that extradition treaty i havent any de-
sire to face grondon without those maps
or was that another ie

  she didnt answer she fumbled inside
the neck of her blouse drawing out a
tiny watch on a cord she snapped open
its cover and checked the time

  he said i cant quite figure you out
youre smart and yet you send your
brother on his way with a piece of paper
worth a million francs while you stay
here to take the rap

  with an unexpected movement she
lowered the automatic

  turning -it in her hand she offered it
to him butt first

  whats this he asked taking it and
hefting it

  i thought maybe it would make you
feel better

  he laughed snapped on the safety and
tossed it on the table

  i also thought youd like to turn me
over to the gendarmes

  she had suddenly started to tremble
she sat down in a chair as though all
strength had that moment vanished from
her muscles she lowered her head in
her hands and commenced to weep-
weep soundlessly with convulsive move-
ments of her shoulders

  starr stamped out his cigarette and

jungle stories

to yeur
community
chest

cause for alarm

the gradual breakdown of the
american home is beginning to be
reflected in the national behavior
pattern and is a real cause for
alarm this was the comment of
j edgar hoover fbi chief in an-
nouncing that crime increased 
per cent in  to a ten-year high

  more persons aged  were ar-
rested than any other age group a
total of  persons under 
were arrested in  they repre-
sented  per cent of the total
arrested

  mr hoover commented that ju-
venile delinquents of the war years
are graduating from petty thieves
into armed robbers and other seri-
ous criminals red feather youth
services of your community chest
are fighting against delinquency by
providing opportunities for youth to
learn and play under wholesome
auspices

  only more-than-average finan-
cial support to community chest
campaigns this fall will help to
combat these worse-than-average
records

  remember everybody benefits
when delinquency and crime are
held down by the activities of red
feather services thats why every-
body should give to your commun-
ity chest campaign

walked to her he patted her on the
shoulder

  listen chicken i dont get this im
not going to let those greasy gendarmes
have you well get out--both of us be-
fore morning i have till sunup to get
that portmanteau back so-

  the portmanteau isnt gone she said
lifting her head i didnt let him take it
with him youll find it gver there be-
side the bed

  they were maps - detailed contour
maps showing the exact route chosen for
the port francqui-leopoldville rail line
a separate map for each ten kilometers
of jungle and a large master map show-
ing all these as well as the branch route
to angola

  starr gave a long whistle so he was
telling the truth after all do you realize
what these things would be worth-he
grinned-to an unscrupulous person
she said i should have let them cap-
ture him

  thats all right darling you wanted
to clear me and yourself and get the
maps back to the owner and you wanted
to save your brothers neck too it was
all right but it wasnt necessary to hold
that gun on me did paul kill albenese
paul was in there trying to get the
portfolio i guess albenese must have
caught him i dont know what happened
i heard something i hid out there on the
verandah i tdidnt have any idea albe-
nese was killed

  its all right albenese had it coming
grondon will forgive everybody for
everything when he gets these maps back
he promised as much in front of sibree
and sibree will hold him to it

  she had stopped crying and was look-
ing up at him a smile touched the cor-
ners of her lips

  whats on your mind now starr
asked still patting her shoulder

  thats no way to comfort a lady

  he drew her close and she made no
resistance

  give me time darling he said
theres a long rainy season ahead of
us-and tonight i have it in my mind to
copy a few of those maps before turning
them over to the gendarme
